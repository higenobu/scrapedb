12/30/2021,"In December, the US government announced a reward of up to $5 million apiece for four of ""El Chapo"" Guzmán's sons. It's the US's highest offer for the group known as Los Chapitos, who have taken on larger roles in the Sinaloa Cartel. But they are only a few of the ""narcojuniors"" who are rising to power in Mexico's biggest criminal group. Sinaloa, MEXICO — The US government is offering up to $5 million apiece for information leading to the capture of four of jailed kingpin Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán's sons. After the elder Guzmán's arrest in January 2016 and extradition to the US a year later, the sons known as ""Los Chapitos"" — Iván Archivaldo Guzmán Salazar, 38, Jesús Alfredo Guzmán Salazar, 38, Ovidio Guzmán López, 31, and Joaquín Guzmán López, 35 — have taken larger leadership roles in the cartel. This is the first time the US has offered a reward of $5 million for each of the sons. The US announcement accuses them of being ""high-ranking members of the Sinaloa Cartel."" The Guzmán-Salazar brothers have ""expanded their enterprise with sophisticated fentanyl laboratories"" and increased their use of maritime and air transportation for smuggling, according to the US State Department. The Guzmán-López brothers have ""high-level command and control roles"" in a faction of the cartel and oversee roughly 11 labs in Sinaloa state that the US says produce 3,000 pounds to 5,000 pounds of meth a month, according to the US. Iván Archivaldo is also well known for showing off cars, money, and ostentatious belongings on social media. Ovidio gained international notoriety in 2019 after Mexican authorities attempted to arrest him, prompting cartel retaliation that led to his release. ""Other information indicates that Ovidio Guzmán-López has ordered the murders of informants, a drug trafficker, and a popular Mexican singer who had refused to sing at his wedding,"" the reward offer says. Operating out of Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloa state and the cartel's home turf, the Guzmans are the most notorious of Mexico's cartel scions, but a new litter of ""narcojuniors"" is rising alongside them. While all eyes have been on Los Chapitos, sons of other notorious Sinaloa drug lords are believed to be behind the cartel's operations. Last week, a video of a shootout in a popular Culiacan club, called Casanova, put El Chapo's nephew, Aureliano Guzmán Araujo, in the spotlight. The video shows several men opening fire inside the club. One man who appears to be Guzmán Araujo aims at another man but fires into the ceiling after a third man pulls his hands up. Behind him, another man fires on another man who then drops to the floor. Guzmán Araujo is the son of Aureliano Guzmán Loera and is known to be a violent member of a new group of leaders in the cartel, according to sources in Culiacán. The elder Aureliano, nicknamed ""El Guano,"" is El Chapo's brother and is believed to be vying for control of the cartel. Guzmán Araujo is also known as El Guanillo, a diminutive form of his father's nickname. ""El Guanillo is very violent. He's known for several killings inside clubs and [for] ordering people killed around Culiacán,"" a source in the city told Insider, requesting anonymity out of fear of retaliation. At the club, Guzmán Araujo ""aimed for the head of the man he was fighting against, but another friend of his lifted his hand,"" the source said. ""Otherwise he would've killed that man, not giving a fuck in front of everyone."" The US has offered a $5 million reward for Aureliano Guzmán Loera, accusing him of running a faction of the cartel responsible for producing and transporting poppy, marijuana, heroin, fentanyl, meth, and cocaine. ""These juniors, sons of the Guzmans but also descendants of other drug bosses, are using their names to operate openly in Sinaloa without any consequence,"" the source in Culiacán said. ""They are a new litter, smarter but also more violent. They grew up around guns and killings, and it's showing."" Another so-called narcojunior, as members of the generation are known, is Jesús Alfredo Beltrán Guzmán, who is known as ""El Mochomito"" after his father, Sinaloa Cartel associate-turned-rival Alfredo Beltrán Leyva, who was called ""El Mochomo."" El Mochomito, who is also El Chapo's nephew, was freed from a Mexican prison without fanfare in September after serving five years of a 10-year sentence for drug trafficking. Sources say the sons of Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada, a shadowy figure considered a peer to El Chapo, are also part of a new crop of leaders in Sinaloa. After Ismael Zambada Imperial, known as ""Mayito Gordo,"" was convicted in April, his half-brother, Ismael Zambada Sicairos, known as ""Mayito Flaco"" or ""Caballero,"" stepped up to help his father run the strongest of the cartel's factions. ""El Mayito Flaco is his dad's right-hand. Contrary to the Guzmán family, he also keeps a low profile, but his name is very respected here in Culiacán. Whenever he is seen in the city he travels with a lot of security,"" the source in Culiacán said. Another Zambada son, Serafín Zambada Ortiz, also known as ""El Sera,"" was captured by the DEA in November 2013 in Nogales, Arizona. He was released in 2018. El Sera is a US citizen, but his whereabouts are unknown, although a source inside the cartel said he is active in the organization. The Zambadas ""are very shadowy,"" the source said, and it is ""really unknown where they are, although their names keep popping up as being everywhere."" ""We receive orders from the viejón [El Mayo Zambada] through radios, and sometimes we hear about his sons helping in operations around the [US] border,"" the source added. Mexican media reported in late 2020 that more than 17 factions were fighting for control of the Sinaloa Cartel, generally considered one of the most powerful criminal groups in the world. Another source within the cartel told Insider that the Guzmán Loera family is already fighting El Mayo's family in some parts of Mexico. Mexico has worked closely with the US for decades to capture or kill cartel leaders. That approach has caused many major cartels to splinter, and the number of armed groups in Mexico has proliferated as a result. Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has been critical of that strategy and has tried to move away from a confrontational approach to the drug war. At his daily press conference on the day the rewards were announced, López Obrador said that if Los Chapitos were in Mexico, Mexico should capture them. It is ""our responsibility to capture them, and we will not allow any foreign enforcement to act against this issue or any other,"" Lopez Obrador said.

12/30/2021,"One thing that’s hard to grasp about the climate crisis is that big changes can happen fast. In 2019, I was aboard the Nathaniel B. Palmer, a 308-foot-long scientific research vessel, cruising in front of the Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica. One day, we were sailing in clear seas in front of the glacier. The next day, we were surrounded by icebergs the size of aircraft carriers. As we later learned from satellite images, in a matter of 48 hours or so, a mélange of ice about 21 miles wide and 15 miles deep had cracked up and scattered into the sea. More from Rolling Stone COP26 Agreement Is 'Not Enough' to Stave Off Global Climate Disaster, UN Chief Says Democrats Are Coming After Big Oil Over the Industry's Endless Climate Bullshit Report: Plastic May Soon Overtake Coal as a Climate Killer It was a spooky moment. Thwaites Glacier is the size of Florida. It is the cork in the bottle of the entire West Antarctic ice sheet, which contains enough ice to raise sea levels by 10 feet. The mélange that disintegrated was not part of the glacier itself, but a mix of icebergs and sea ice that had cozied up next to it. Still, the idea that it could just fall apart overnight was mind-blowing. Alex Mazur As it turns out, the ice breakup I witnessed was not a freak event. A few weeks ago, scientists participating in the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration, a $25 million five-year-long joint research program between the National Science Foundation in the U.S. and the Natural Environment Research Council in the U.K., presented their latest research. They described the discovery of cracks and fissures in the Thwaites eastern ice shelf, predicting that the ice shelf could fracture like a shattered car window in as little as five years. “It won’t scatter out into sea as quickly as what you saw when you were down there,” Erin Pettit, a glaciologist at Oregon State University and one of the lead principal investigators in the ITGC, later told me. “But the basic process is the same. The ice shelf is breaking up and could be gone in less than a decade.” Given the ongoing war for American democracy and the deadly toll of the Covid pandemic, the loss of an ice shelf on a far-away continent populated by penguins might not seem to be big news. But in fact, the West Antarctic ice sheet is one of the most important tipping points in the Earth’s climate system. If Thwaites Glacier collapses, it opens the door for the rest of the West Antarctic ice sheet to slide into the sea. Globally, 250 million people live within three feet of high tide lines. Ten feet of sea level rise would be a world-bending catastrophe. It’s not only goodbye Miami, but goodbye to virtually every low-lying coastal city in the world. But predicting the breakup of ice sheets and the implications for future sea level rise is fraught with uncertainty. Depending on various emissions scenarios in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, we could have as little as one foot of sea level rise by the end of the century, or nearly six feet of sea level rise (of course, rising seas won’t stop in 2100, but that date has become a common benchmark). “The difference between those [models] is a lot of lives and money,” says Richard Alley, a glaciologist at Penn State University and one of the great ice scientists of our time. Alley adds: “The most likely place to generate [the worst scenario] is Thwaites.” Or to put it more urgently: “If there is going to be a climate catastrophe,” Ohio State glaciologist Ian Howat once told me, “it’s probably going to start at Thwaites.” The problem is, understanding what’s going on at Thwaites is fiendishly complex. As I wrote in 2017: The trouble with Thwaites, which is one of the largest glaciers on the planet, is that it’s also what scientists call “a threshold system.” That means instead of melting slowly like an ice cube on a summer day, it is more like a house of cards: It’s stable until it is pushed too far, then it collapses. Thwaites is very different from other big glaciers, such as those in Greenland. For one thing, it is not melting from above, due to warmer air temperatures. It’s melting from below, due to warmer ocean water eating away at its underbelly. More importantly, the terrain beneath the West Antarctic ice sheet is peculiar. “Think of it as a giant soup bowl filled with ice,” Sridhar Anandakrishnan, an expert in polar glaciology at Penn State University, once told me. In the bowl analogy, the edge of the glacier — the spot where a glacier leaves the land and begins to float — is perched on the lip of the bowl 1,000 feet or more below sea level. Scientists call that lip the “grounding line.” Below the lip, the terrain falls away on a downward slope for hundreds of miles, all the way to the Transantarctic Mountains that divide East and West Antarctica. At the deepest part of the basin, the ice is about two miles thick. What this means is that once the warm water gets below ice, it can flow down the slope of the bowl, weakening the ice from below. Through a mechanism called “marine ice-cliff Instability,” you can get what amounts to a runaway collapse of the ice sheet that could raise global sea levels very high, very fast. That’s why, when I wrote my 2017 Rolling Stone story about Thwaites, I dubbed it “The Doomsday Glacier.” (The name stuck — if you type the phrase into Google now, you get half a million hits.) In a worst-case scenario, how fast could Thwaites collapse? No one knows. The IPCC data is the best guide for sea level rise for the rest of this century, although Alley cautions me that even six feet of sea level rise by 2100 is not the worst-case scenario. “We just don’t know what the upper boundary is for how fast this can happen,” Alley says. “We are dealing with an event that no human has ever witnessed before. We have no analog for this.” In the past few years, scientists have made a lot of progress in understanding the dynamics of Thwaites. On our 2019 cruise, scientists discovered troughs in the seabed that allowed warm water to flow underneath the ice shelf. Scientists have mapped the underside of the glacier itself, tracked crevasses in the ice shelf, and located pinning points that might slow the retreat of the ice. The change has been dramatic: “The net rate of ice loss from Thwaites Glacier is more than six times what it was in the early 1990s,” says Rob Larter, a geophysicist with the British Antarctic Survey who was the chief scientist on my trip to Antarctica in 2019. The recent news about Thwaites’ eastern ice shelf breaking up in the next five years was not really a surprise to anyone who has been tracking the science closely. After the sudden disintegration of the Larsen B ice shelf in 2002, scientists realized that Antarctica was far less stable than many had believed. The discovery of cracks and fissures at Thwaites further underscore just how dynamic the changes already underway are. Erin Pettit To be clear, there is a big difference between an ice shelf and the glacier itself. The ice shelf is like a thumbnail that grows out from the glacier and floats on the ocean. Because it is already floating, when it melts it doesn’t in itself contribute to sea level rise (just as when ice cubes melt in your glass, they don’t raise the level of liquid). But ice shelves are important because they buttress glaciers. Like the flying buttresses of Notre Dame, they give the walls of ice stability. And when they break up, the land-based glacier is free to flow much faster into the sea. And that does raise sea levels. So yeah, if Thwaites loses a significant part of its ice shelf in five years, that’s a big deal. But even if a big part of the ice shelf does crack up, there is a lot of unknown complexity in how it will play out. “A first question is, if the ice-shelf breakage continues, will the whole ice shelf be lost, or will a short ice shelf remain, at least in some places?” Richard Alley emailed me. “Almost all ice-shelf ice is buttressing, generating friction that holds back the non-floating ice, so loss of part, most or all of the ice shelf will increase flow of non-floating ice into the ocean. But the most-important buttressing tends to arise closest to the grounding zone, so if a short ice shelf does remain, it may still provide important buttressing, and the speedup of flow and thinning will be smaller than they could be with full ice-shelf loss.” Here you see the problem. Even predicting how the crackup of the ice shelf will impact the flow of the glacier is difficult to estimate. And this is only one of the uncertainties that scientists face when trying to predict whether or not Miami will be underwater by 2100. There is further uncertainty in exactly where and when the ice will fracture, how much warm water will be pushed up beneath the glacier by changing winds and ocean currents, how the character of the bed the glacier rests on will speed up or slow down the glacier’s slide into the sea. Whether the bed is hard rock or muddy till can have a big impact on the velocity of the glacier, just as the texture of snow affects how fast you ski down a mountain. “Ice is alive,” says Pettit. “It moves and flows and breaks in ways that are difficult to anticipate.” Paradoxically, the more scientists learn about what’s going on at Thwaites, the more divergent the latest climate models have become about its future. Consider the results of two models by highly respected scientists published side by side in Nature earlier this year. One model suggests that Thwaites stays fairly stable until temperatures rise above 2 C of warming. Then all hell breaks loose. Thwaites begins to fall into the sea like a line of dominoes pushed off a table and soon takes the rest of the West Antarctic ice sheet with it. And once the collapse begins, according to this model, it will be impossible to stop — at least on any human time scale. In a century or so, global sea levels could rise 10 feet, which would swamp South Florida and Bangladesh and many other low-lying regions of the world. In the other model, global sea level rise only differs by 4½ inches between a 1.5 C global temperature rise and a 3 C temperature rise (which is a little above where we are headed with under current emissions scenarios). And much of that comes from increased melt in Greenland and mountain glaciers. As for Antarctica, the paper says explicitly: “No clear dependence on emissions scenario emerges for Antarctica.” So what to make of all this? “The current divergence among model predictions is actually a good sign because it means that scientists are probing different parameterizations, representations of processes, and hypotheses,” writes Jeremy Bassis, a geophysicist at the University of Michigan. Bassis suggests not focusing so much on the long-term uncertainty and highlighting instead what scientists know about the next few decades. “The skill of models in predicting sea level change on decadal time scales is high, and we already have actionable projections on these time scales. We should be emphasizing that fact in discussions with community members, stakeholders, and decision-makers, so they can move ahead with important adaptation and mitigation planning.” But in the long run, it is not clear that the dynamics of ice sheet collapse that are underway at Thwaites can be stopped. As glaciologist Eric Rignot put it in 2015, in Antarctica, “the fuse has been blown.” Even if we cut carbon emissions to zero tomorrow, warm water will continue to flow beneath the ice sheet for decades, destabilizing the ice and further pushing the glacier toward eventual collapse. This doesn’t means that cutting carbon pollution to zero isn’t an important goal — nothing, in fact, is more important or more urgent. “We may have a small safety margin in Antarctica, but not a large one,” says Alley. Even if the fuse is blown, cutting emissions fast could slow it all down to a millennium-long crack-up that will give us more time to adapt. One way or another, our future is written in ice.

12/30/2021,"You’ve probably seen the famous footage of Bigfoot — that grainy film from 1967 showing an apelike creature ambling through the California woods, casting a brief, leisurely glance at the camera before disappearing off screen. What an Illinois man saw last month was rather different. The creature he says he spotted outside the small town of Chandlerville, northwest of Springfield, was fast, athletic and massive, covering a two-lane road in two quick strides. It had incredibly long limbs and was covered in shiny black hair, the man said, and was gone almost before he could register what was happening. “It jumped into the darkness and I was kind of freaked out about it,” said the man, a 59-year-old engineer who lives near Peoria. “I said to myself out loud, ‘(Expletive) Bigfoot!’” In a year when UFOs have gained newfound respect, becoming the subject of a Pentagon investigative panel, the alleged Bigfoot sighting is a reminder that other paranormal phenomena are still out there, entrancing true believers and amusing skeptics. Sasquatches are having a particularly good run. In the past 12 months they’ve been the subject of a conference in Florida, where they’re known as skunk apes, and have been featured in several documentaries and TV programs, including one that investigates whether a Bigfoot killed a trio of California pot farmers. In Oklahoma, state Rep. Justin Humphrey, whose district hosts an annual Bigfoot festival, sought to pass a law that would establish a Sasquatch hunting season and announced a $3 million reward for the capture of a live one, though he all but admitted it was a stunt to attract tourists. “We are wanting the whole world to come to Southeastern Oklahoma … and get involved in our bounty,” he said on the floor of the statehouse. Illinois, which according to the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization has had more than 300 reported sightings, has also been known to play the publicity game. Doug and Carrie DeVore, owners of the Shawnee Forest Cabins, mounted a 7-foot-tall concrete statue known as Sassy on their property several years ago, and it has since become a roadside attraction. Carrie DeVore said she didn’t realize until later that the nearby Shawnee National Forest is a hotbed of sightings: People have phoned her to talk about their own supposed encounters with the creature. “I am sure there are people who have seen something,” she said. “(I hear) the earnestness in their voices when they call me up, but I was a geologist before (having) kids and getting into the cabin rental business so the other part of me is like, ‘We’d find some evidence, wouldn’t we?’ But I guess it remains to be seen.” The downstate engineer who says he spotted the mysterious figure last month asked not to be named after the initial report of his sighting, released without his knowledge, brought him a crush of unsought attention (“I don’t want to be known as Mr. Bigfoot,” he said). He said he was driving home on Illinois Route 78 after visiting his mother when, just across the Sangamon River, he saw the creature bound across the road about 40 yards from his vehicle. It turned toward him just before it vanished, though he couldn’t make out its eyes or face. The man said he is not a Bigfoot enthusiast and was sober as a judge when he made his sighting. He acknowledged, though, that when friends went back to look for tracks, they found nothing. Even so, Matthew Moneymaker of the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization graded the man’s sighting as Class A, or very reliable: The relative closeness of the encounter and lack of red flags about the man’s credibility helped to convince him, he said. Moneymaker, who has produced or hosted several Bigfoot-related TV shows, said he started his organization in the mid-1990s after he spotted a “squatch” during an early morning outing in a patch of woods near Akron, Ohio. Since then the group has received hundreds of sighting reports each year, he said, with many coming from the Pacific Northwest. His theory is that the creature is a primate genus known as Gigantopithecus that crossed into North America from Asia during the Ice Age and has managed to elude capture. But Paul Garber, a University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign anthropologist who studies primates, said that is not supported by the fossil record. Gigantopithecus went extinct around 500,000 years ago, he said, and there’s no evidence it ever made it here. He said a large primate would leave telltale signs of its presence, from droppings to bones to the remnants of “nests” in which apes sleep. Moneymaker said the lack of definitive proof could be due to Sasquatches living in extremely remote areas, but Garber said that’s also true of other big apes whose existence has been well documented. Garber said tales of Bigfoot-like creatures exist all over the world, which he attributes to the human impulse to rationalize odd sights that defy ready explanation. “I believe this guy saw something,” he said. “I just think the visual evidence alone is what we have. The other kind of physical evidence that would be consistent with ape behavior is what we tend not to have.” Pressed about what he saw, the man said he thought it might have been a bear running at full tilt, but its bipedal gait and the lack of bear tracks convinced him otherwise. It resembled the classic image of Bigfoot, he said, and others who live in the area have since told him they’ve seen similar creatures. As for the possibility of a prankster, the man said he hoped that isn’t true. “If someone thinks of coming down to central Illinois to put a hoax on people or something, I wouldn’t recommend it,” he said. “There’s just way too many hunters. There’s too many people with guns. It would be too dangerous.”",U.S./Chicago Tribune,‘(Expletive) Bigfoot!’ Alleged Sasquatch sighting in central Illinois adds to legendary creature’s big year,https://news.yahoo.com/expletive-bigfoot-alleged-sasquatch-sighting-090000828.html
