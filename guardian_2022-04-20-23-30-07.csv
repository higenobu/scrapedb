4/20/2022,"He is the most famous Black person from the Tudor era, a court trumpeter who performed at important regal celebrations and was highly rewarded for his skill by Henry VIII. Now the story of John Blanke, one of the first people of African descent to have both a visual and written record in Britain, will be told at a major exhibition at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool. It will be the first time in almost 20 years that members of the public will have a chance to see Blanke’s portrait, which appears on the Westminster Tournament Roll – a fragile 511-year-old manuscript that is rarely on display and has never before been exhibited outside London. Blanke, who performed at the funeral of Henry VII and the coronation of Henry VIII in 1509, is believed by some historians to have arrived in England from Spain a few years earlier, as a member of Catherine of Aragon’s entourage. He is pictured twice on the Roll, playing the trumpet at the opening and closing ceremonies of the great tournament of Westminster in 1511. Trumpet players were often referred to as the “heralds of the gods”. “It’s extraordinarily rare to see a Black Tudor,” said Kate O’Donoghue, curator of the forthcoming exhibition, The Tudors: Passion, Power and Politics, which opens on 21 May. “This is one of the earliest known portraits of a named African living in Tudor England.” The tournament was held by Henry VIII to celebrate the birth of his son Henry – who died in infancy just nine days later – and the delicate vellum Roll, which is 17.9 metres long, records the spectacle and grandeur of the Tudor court in all its chivalric pageantry. As well as appearing twice on the Roll, written records suggest that Blanke – who is known to have been a court trumpeter to both Henry VII and Henry VIII – was a highly regarded member of the royal retinue. “We know a bit about John Blanke’s relationship to Henry VIII, which is really extraordinary,” O’Donoghue said. For example, when Blanke was married in 1512, the King gifted him with “very fine clothing”. And when one of his fellow trumpeters died, “Blanke asked Henry VII for a considerable pay rise”. The King granted him his wish, doubling his pay from eight to 16 pence a day. She hopes the exhibition will challenge some of the misconceptions many people still hold about England in the 16th century. “I think many people probably still think of Tudor England as somewhere that was very white.” But as well as John Blanke, evidence from baptism, marriage and burial records shows there were “a lot of other Africans living in England during this period”, she said. “Tudor society was actually quite ethnically diverse, and Africans were part of that society. John Blanke is just one example, because we have that visual record of him at the court, but he’s a hint to the wider African presence in England and across Wales, Scotland and Ireland at this time.” The exhibition will also present 24 artworks produced by artists as part of The John Blanke Project, a contemporary art and archive project which celebrates Blanke’s presence at the Tudor court. Michael Ohajuru, director of the John Blanke Project, said: “In highlighting the role of John Blanke within this exhibition, and presenting responses from contemporary artists and historians, we’re able to tell a real, inclusive Tudor story. In this way, history, art and the imagination can work together to make connections between Black British history, then and now.”",Arts/Art and design,Story of Henry VIII’s Black trumpeter to be told at Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/20/story-of-henry-viiis-black-trumpeter-to-be-told-at-walker-art-gallery-in-liverpool
4/20/2022,"Right now, Netflix is a swirling vortex of unanswered questions. There’s the question of how it will respond to all its recently lost subscribers. There’s the issue of whether or not it will start to allow advertising on its platform. But most of all – miles above that, the greatest mystery of all time – is how the hell Anatomy of a Scandal got to be so popular. If you haven’t seen it, Anatomy of a Scandal represents the latest step of David E Kelley’s malicious plan to churn out more obnoxious hour-long dramas about objectively awful rich people than anyone else in history. This time, David E Kelley’s One Idea has moved to London; or at least a cartoon version of London where everyone is a dribbling cut-glass bellend and the House of Commons appears to have been made out of plywood in a hurry. And it is terrible. Anatomy of a Scandal is a courtroom drama that hinges on a twist so stupid that it can only realistically be met with a weary sigh. It’s so preposterously overlit and soapily staged that it seems as if the entire series has crawled into your television’s settings and deliberately reinstalled motion smoothing out of spite. The only good performances are those that (like Joshua McGuire’s frazzled political adviser) seem to be aware of the nonstop idiocy that surrounds them. It is really not very good at all. Why then, despite all this, is Anatomy of a Scandal so popular, currently the most watched Netflix show in the world? Glad you asked. Here’s my theory. It’s because of the final shot of the first episode, which is perhaps the most gloriously stupid thing that has ever been committed to television. If you don’t want it spoiled, get out now. Anatomy of a Scandal is dreadful and hilarious. This is how the first episode ends. pic.twitter.com/jj9cDBSEXq So, episode one is all about charming MP Rupert Friend admitting to his wife that he had a brief affair with a colleague. He rides out the scandal but, just as the fuss is starting to die down, he is accused of rape. How does Rupert Friend, the star of this apparently prestigious and strait-laced legal drama, react to the accusation? Here’s how: by literally flying backwards through the air in slow motion, like he’s being flung backwards by an invisible explosion. This happens entirely unannounced, by the way. Rupert Friend flying through the air comes after a full episode of almost total nothingness. It’s like John Woo got wind of how boring the thing was going to be, and jumped out of a helicopter to gee things up at the last minute. Now, you’re not going to stop watching after something like that, are you? You’re going to sit back in your sofa, stunned beyond all comprehension, and perhaps inspect your drink like a disbelieving vagrant in a 1930s cartoon. You’re going to take a deep breath and close your eyes and think “Did Rupert Friend really react to a rape accusation by literally flying backwards through the air, in the middle of the street, like a ragdoll, or have I just suffered a debilitating blunt force trauma to the base of my skull?” And while you’re sitting there, wondering if you have really just witnessed something as gormless as that, Netflix will have skipped the credits and started autoplaying the next episode. And then – just as you have barely managed to scrape back the obliterated fragments of your exploded mind – it happens again. Although episode two of Anatomy of a Scandal is just as dreary as the first, it ends (again, without anything even approaching a warning) with Sienna Miller tumbling backwards out of an imaginary lift and falling in slow motion through an empty courtroom. Nobody knows why. There’s no explanation. There’s not really very much of a point. It’s just a thing that happens, presumably to thrust you back into the same cluster-migraine fugue state that you’ve only just escaped, so episode three can sneak on to your screen without you knowing it. Of course, by this point you’ve wised up to the formula. Anatomy of a Scandal is a bad Channel 5 courtroom drama enlivened by deeply stupid moments of heavy-handed fantasy sequences. So you scrub through the third episode just to see how it ends, and it ends with the camera spinning around while the Aimee Mann song from Magnolia plays. So you click “next episode” and immediately skip to the end and, like clockwork, Michelle Dockery is confronted by her younger self. By this point, you no longer care about the plot of Anatomy of a Scandal. You’re just fast-forwarding through episodes to see what batshit moment of ill-fitting tonal weirdness is going to come next. And, in the moment when one character says “I can look you in the eye” to another character, before they’re suddenly plunged into what can only be described as the set of Meat Loaf’s I’d Do Anything For Love (But I Won’t Do That) video just so that they can look each other in the eye really hard, you are finally satisfied. You’ve watched an entire series just to see how stupid it can get. And Netflix logged this data accordingly. And that’s why Anatomy of a Scandal is so popular.",Arts/Television & radio,That Anatomy of a Scandal scene: is this the silliest TV moment ever?,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/20/anatomy-of-a-scandal-netflix-tv-moment
4/20/2022,"In 1984, Tracey Meares was on her way to becoming her Illinois high school’s first Black valedictorian, with the highest academic ranking at Springfield High. Instead, she was declared “top student” – alongside Heather Russell, a white student. Thirty-eight years later, Meares is valedictorian at last, after she was finally presented with the title last Saturday after a screening of the documentary No Title for Tracey. Directed by Maria Ansley, an Illinois film-maker, it tells a story of systematic racism in America. For Meares, now a legal scholar at Yale College of Law, the hurt is still fresh. “It was incredibly upsetting when I was 17. I remain angry about it today, and sad,” she said. Meares recalls odd events in the lead-up to graduation. She says a white assistant principal was caught removing her file from a cabinet in the school counselor’s office. “I was called to my counselor’s office, and she told me what had happened. She said she put a lock on the file cabinet to keep anyone from getting in there again and tampering with my school record,” Meares has said. Meanwhile, according to Meares’s father, Robert Blackwell, the school’s administrators began introducing Russell to different service clubs as the school’s top graduating senior. As graduation neared, Springfield High chose to pivot from its tradition of naming valedictorians and salutatorians, and to opt instead for “top students”. Eight years later, in 1992, it resumed using the original titles. Although the incident was well known among the Black community in Springfield, Blackwell chose not to publicize it. “How do you protect your children when there’s so much harm that will come based on their race, and only their race?” he told the Illinois Times years later. Blackwell said he and his wife were afraid that if they went public with how the school was discriminating against Meares, school officials might retaliate against their other two daughters. “It didn’t change our lives. We still had goals that we had always had,” he said. “And Tracey just kind of flipped that and kept learning, kept achieving, and we didn’t spend time commiserating about the situation.” In 2021, during a weekend trip with Meares’s sister Nicole Florence, a Ansley, who at the time was a photographer with Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, heard the story. “With everything that happened with George Floyd, it had us talking about lots of different things,” Ansley told USA Today. “Dr Florence proceeded to tell us the story about her sister. It was the first time I had heard it. I was like, this story needs to be told.” To Florence, No Title for Tracey is her sister’s opportunity to tell “her truth and hopefully for her to process” – while to Meares it’s about more than just her. “I think she thinks that bringing this to light is going to matter for other people,” she said of her sister’s involvement in the documentary. “She’s not doing it for me, per se. That is sort of the point of racial justice: that when people engage in projects like this, they actually aren’t doing it for themselves.”",News/US news,Black high school valedictorian honored 38 years after ‘incredibly upsetting’ snub,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/20/high-school-valedictorian-tracey-meares-illinois-snub
4/20/2022,"This documentary represents a painstakingly detailed, fantastically entertaining, and profoundly exhausting deep dive into the career of the hyper-prolific Italian composer Ennio Morricone, known best perhaps for his orchestral scores for Sergio Leone (including the so-called Dollars Trilogy and Once Upon a Time in the West), Gillo Pontecorvo’s The Battle of Algiers, Bernardo Bertolucci’s 1900 – and a whole bunch of American films, ranging from the great (Terrence Malick’s Days of Heaven, Brian De Palma’s The Untouchables) to the abominable (Quentin Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight). It’s not so much the running time of 156 minutes that will tire you out as the incredible sonic, visual and emotional overload generated by the work itself; perhaps this is ideally seen first in a cinema for maximum impact and then again in small, digestible chunks at home. It’s one huge cinematic mosaic that tessellates a massive interview with the man himself (fortuitously filmed just before he died in 2020) with acres of archival footage and snippets from the movies he wrote soundtracks for. On top of that, there’s hundreds of interview clips from his innumerable collaborators, friends and admirers – even if some of them seem to be there just to show off how good the producers were at snagging big names. (Bruce Springsteen, for example, is a bit too gushy and hyperbolic.) However, any weak spots are more than compensated for by the overall level of discourse that gives paramount place to the music above all else, with intelligent, pithy observations from Morricone’s classical composer contemporaries such as Boris Porena, as well as other film music maestros including Hans Zimmer and Mychael Danna. As you would expect, there are lots of lovely personal anecdotes from assorted collaborators, including Joan Baez and singers little known outside of Italy who remember Morricone’s innovative arrangements for RCA pop songs before he moved into film. English director Roland Joffé is particularly entertaining, showing off his Italian while discussing Morricone’s mighty score for Joffé’s The Mission, which we see performed by a massive orchestra with Morricone conducting. Given the documentary’s director is Giuseppe Tornatore, it’s no surprise a small chunk is given over to his collaborations with Morricone such as Cinema Paradiso, but on the whole Tornatore makes it ultimately about his main subject. Kudos is also due to editor Massimo Quaglia’s astonishingly fluid work splicing it all together.

4/20/2022,"In 2015, one million Syrians arrived in Germany in search of safety. Five years later, I was on a newspaper assignment in Nuremberg, a city to the south of country, documenting the integration of these refugees into German society. This was one of the examples where everything had worked out brilliantly. On the right is Malak. When she arrived in Germany, she didn’t know a word of the language. It was really hard but she worked like hell to learn and build a new life. Five years later, she had managed to put herself right through secondary school. This is from her graduation day. That’s when I first met her and her family. It was the summer of 2020 and lockdowns had only just begun to ease across Europe. The school had built a stage outside because of fears of infection. They called each student one by one to receive their certificate. All of Malak’s family who made it to Germany were there, and they livestreamed the ceremony for their uncles and aunts who remained in Idlib, northwestern Syria. This was just after she had received her diploma. You can see her mother filming everything and her sister completely overcome. It’s hard to explain how much this meant to them. Many of the uncles and aunts who remain in Idlib still live in great danger. To have this success – and to be able to share it with her immediate family and those halfway across the world – was so special. This was one of those assignments where I went in with few expectations, but lucked out and found this extraordinary person. We interviewed her before the ceremony, so when I came to take this, I felt I had a sense of her character. I’ll always remember the moment I met her: she was wearing this beautiful purple dress, silver heels and the biggest smile, clearly so proud of herself and so happy to be there. It was so important to capture this joy, because behind it lay so much strength. These three women fled Syria on their own and built a beautiful life for themselves. Only later did Malak’s father and youngest brother join them. It’s so rare to see stories of strong Muslim women in western media. It felt important to tell their story. Not everyone has flourished in the same way, however. Lots of Syrian refugees have struggled to find work and put down roots. And a lot of Germans seem to forget that part of the problem is the rules and restrictions that stop refugees from traveling freely. My camera gives me the opportunity to meet people and build some form of relationship. I don’t like fast journalism. Of course, sometimes it’s not possible to talk to subjects for years, or follow up with them down the line, but I always make time to get to know them before I shoot. I want it to be more of an encounter. And I hope that’s what this shows: a beautiful, intimate moment that also tells a larger story about the world. I stayed in touch with Malak and managed to meet her again a year later. She’s now studying medical engineering. Things were hard for her – starting in the middle of a pandemic meant she didn’t get to meet many of her classmates face to face – but I have no doubt she’ll do well. She’s an amazing young woman.

4/20/2022,"Thames Water dumped untreated effluent for more than 68,000 hours into the river systems around Oxford last year, campaigners have revealed, arguing that the sum of money the company plans to spend to improve the situation is woefully inadequate. The company discharged raw sewage into the River Thames and its tributaries including the River Windrush, Thame, Evenlode and Ock 5,028 times in 2021, according to data analysed by the Oxford Rivers Improvement Campaign (ORIC). Using data from Thames Water and applying the Environment Agency formula for capacity required at any treatment works, the campaigners assessed that the 10 large sewage treatment works operating in the upper Thames area – from Didcot in the south to Moreton-in-Marsh and Bourton-on-the-Water in the Cotswolds – were unable to treat the full capacity of sewage for the population of 1.1 million. Their calculations indicate Oxford and Witney treatment works can cope with only 62% of the capacity needed for the population, and the treatment works in Banbury is sufficient for just 49% of the required capacity. The failure to invest in the capacity of the treatment works had led to more raw sewage in the rivers, the campaigners said. All 10 works discharged sewage into the rivers in 2021 for an average of 11 hours a week. Oxford sewage treatment works released raw sewage into the waters for 892 hours in 2021, Swindon for 501 hours and Witney for 935 hours. Thames Water is investing in the improvement of four of the large treatment works and 11 smaller works – just a third of the works that need to be expanded to stop sewage discharges into the rivers, according to the ORIC. When population increases are taken into consideration, the investment plans cover just a quarter – 15 of 57 – treatment works needing investment by 2025. “The simple truth is that Thames Water’s plans are completely inadequate,” said Mark Hull, a former water industry consultant and founding member of ORIC. “Given the well-established and longstanding problems faced across the upper Thames region, it is scandalous that appropriate and coordinated investment plans for the whole region are not in place. “Thames Water and the government’s Environment Agency have failed to deal with this problem over many years. Their ongoing underperformance beggars belief – especially as the industry’s financial regulator, Ofwat, have made it clear that they would not oppose the necessary investment.” The report, published on Wednesday by ORIC, found that even where Thames Water had planned investment, the expansion of capacity could be insufficient for the 2020s and 2030s. At Witney treatment works the investment will increase capacity by 50% increase but that would improve the works to only 93% of the required capacity based on the 2020 population, the report says. Across the upper Thames, 102 sewage treatment works discharged into the rivers in 2021. Forty-nine of them discharged for more than 10 hours a week; and almost quarter of the works discharged for more than 1,000 hours in the year. The campaign group analysed the scale of raw sewage discharges in the upper Thames from the Environment Agency’s data for 2021. It also examined the agency’s database of investments by water companies. Hull said: “Government, the Environment Agency and Thames Water keep telling us that they are dealing with the problems. The truth is simple. They are not.” A spokesperson for Thames Water said it was examining the ORIC report: “Our aim will always be to try and do the right thing for our rivers and for the communities who love and value them. We regard all discharges of untreated sewage as unacceptable and will work with the government, Ofwat and the Environment Agency to accelerate work to stop them being necessary and are determined to be transparent. “We recently launched our river health commitments, which include a 50% reduction in the total annual duration of spills across London and the Thames Valley by 2030, and within that an 80% reduction in sensitive catchments. We have a long way to go – and we certainly can’t do it on our own – but the ambition is clear.”",News/Environment,"Thames Water dumped raw sewage into rivers 5,028 times in 2021",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/20/thames-water-raw-sewage-rivers-2021
4/20/2022,"Sir Gordon Downey, who has died aged 93, leaves a substantial legacy of parliamentary and government scrutiny. In the 1980s this quiet civil servant created the modern National Audit Office (NAO), and in the following decade investigated major political scandals as parliamentary standards commissioner, among them the “cash for questions” affair, initiated by the Guardian. In this, he found “compelling evidence” that the MP Neil Hamilton accepted cash for lobbying from the former Harrods owner Mohamed Al Fayed. The matter came to light when Fayed told the editor of the Guardian, Peter Preston, in an aside that he had to pay two Conservative MPs, then junior ministers, Hamilton and Tim Smith, money to ask questions in parliament over a long-running dispute between Fayed and Tiny Rowland, a British businessman, over the ownership of Harrods. He also cited Ian Greer, a former Tory agent who ran one of the biggest parliamentary lobbying companies at the time, as the conduit for the arrangement. When the story broke in 1994, both ministers resigned. Smith admitted accepting money but Hamilton and Greer denied it and sued the Guardian. In 1995 the Tory prime minister, John Major, set up the committee on standards in public life, chaired by Lord (Michael) Nolan, laying down seven principles as a code of conduct for public life. The Nolan committee recommended the appointment of a parliamentary commissioner, the post that Downey took up. Hamilton and Greer’s case collapsed in 1996. Greer’s lobbying company went bust and he left the country for South Africa. Hamilton subsequently lost his safe Tory seat in Tatton to an independent “anti-sleaze” candidate, Martin Bell. Following a long and complex investigation, in which Hamilton kept denying the allegations and tried to blame journalists and Fayed for the scandal, Downey said the evidence that clinched the case – about the handing over of up to £25,000 cash in brown envelopes – came from one of Fayed’s former staff, who was studying to be a lawyer. She would, he reasoned, have risked ruining a promising career if she had lied to him. However, Downey’s report came after the 1997 general election. Since Hamilton had not been returned to the Commons, there was no scope for its standards and privileges committee to suspend him, and it could go no further than allowing Downey’s conclusions to stand. Dale (later Lord) Campbell-Savours, then a Labour MP, who saw Downey regularly as auditor general and parliamentary commissioner, described him as having “an agile brain, very forensic”. Downey had a meticulous grasp of detail and was a consummate Whitehall player. Born in Wandsworth, south-west London, the son of Winifred (nee Dick) and Stanley, an accounts manager, Downey was educated at the Tiffin school, a boys’ grammar school in Kingston upon Thames. His father died in the second world war, leaving his mother to bring up Gordon and his two older sisters. Following national service with the Royal Artillery he took an economics degree at the London School of Economics and in 1951 started his first job in Whitehall at the Ministry of Works. A year later he moved on to the Treasury. He served as assistant secretary to successive chancellors, including Rab Butler, Peter Thorneycroft and Harold Macmillan. Downey soon rose to become deputy secretary at the Treasury before in 1978 being loaned as deputy head of the central policy review staff, where he ended his Whitehall career in 1981. He then became comptroller and auditor general, at that time part of the exchequer and audit department, run by the Treasury. His predecessor, Douglas Henley, had wanted to turn it into an independent body. It was left to Downey to undertake the task. The Treasury had run the department since the days of Gladstone and was firmly opposed, and the government did not allocate time to change the law. But Norman St John-Stevas, a former cabinet minister who had been sacked by the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, as leader of the House in 1981, promoted the change in a private member’s bill in 1983. When Thatcher called a general election, the bill became law without further debate in what is known in parliament as the “wash up” of partly completed legislation. The change wrong-footed the Treasury and also the security services, which found their spending for the first time examined by an independent body, the NAO, and the following year Downey was knighted. He used the NAO’s new independence to change its profile. It produced the first value-for-money reports on government departments, which would then be published and later scrutinised at meetings of the House of Commons public accounts committee. This process became a powerful tool for politicians and the public for scrutinising the workings of government. It has exposed waste and scandals across Whitehall. Downey ran into trouble in 1987 when the New Statesman investigative journalist Duncan Campbell accused him of hiding from parliament plans by the Ministry of Defence to build a top secret military satellite called Zircon. The row escalated when Special Branch raided the magazine and the BBC’s then director general, Alasdair Milne, decided not to broadcast a documentary on Zircon that had been commissioned by the BBC from Campbell. In the melee that followed, Milne resigned, but Downey survived, issuing a rare four-page press statement denying he had covered Zircon up. He did not deny the plan existed but said it did not reach the level of expenditure required for publication to parliament. The satellite was never built. Downey left the NAO in 1987. As complaints commissioner at the securities association (1989-90), overseeing stockbrockers, he investigated the procedures used to handle complaints. Further city regulatory posts followed with Fimbra, responsible for independent financial advisers (1990-93) and the PIA (Personal Investment Authority, 1993). In parallel he became readers’ representative at the Independent newspaper (1990-95), investigating complaints about articles, and then came the parliamentary commissioner post. Downey found shortcomings in the way the job had been set up. Rather than having the authority to send for all the documents in investigations, or summon people to attend, he had to get agreement with a committee of MPs to do so. In 1998 his term came to an end, and he left the job. In subsequent articles in the Guardian in 2001 Downey warned that parliament risked losing public confidence in scrutiny of MPs. Writing about the plight of his successor, Elizabeth Filkin, when she faced problems obtaining information from Keith Vaz, on alleged undeclared outside payments, he said: “MPs need to watch their system of self-regulation rather carefully if public trust is not to be forfeited”, adding: “It is not sufficient that parliament and its officials should be at ease with themselves. It is vital that the public, too, should have confidence in the process.” Since then, parliament has altered the composition of the committee – which now has an equal number of MPs and independent appointees and it has strengthened the code of conduct so MPs have to co-operate with any inquiry by the commissioner. In 1952 Downey married Jacqueline Goldsmith, a teacher. She, their daughters, Alison and Erica, and granddaughters, Sophie and Emily, survive him.

4/20/2022,"Look, I can whip through the theatre criticism if you like. Let’s do it quickly. Anthony Albanese, in the first leaders’ debate of the 2022 federal election campaign, moved early to establish professional equivalence with Scott Morrison by deploying a workmanlike grasp of facts and a basic rhetorical flex. Throughout, Albanese referred to the prime minister as “Scott”. Not the prime minister, or the Liberal party leader, or the more exalted campaign formulation, “my opponent”. Just “Scott”. This could have been accidental but it wasn’t. It was status erosion; a deliberate, persistent, quiet, diminution of incumbency, which is the greatest structural advantage prime ministers have in a campaign. Albanese clearly went into Wednesday night’s encounter with a basic objective: look plausibly prime ministerial. Be familiar on this terrain, without being cloying or presumptuous. Carry yourself as “Scott’s” equal. Be the safe change of your campaign messaging. Command this platform without looking smug or over bearing, and when “Scott” is too oily, or too sharp, or slightly too rehearsed – when he gets that serene smart arse expression that voters now very easily recognise – provide the required counterpoint. Show as well as tell. Break back into the debate with some active listening and some empathy. If you stumble – and Albanese did at one point when he very obviously couldn’t remember why he hadn’t implemented boat turn-backs back when he was deputy prime minister in the late Rudd epoch of Rudd/Gillard/Rudd – then loop back and clean it up. Albanese’s cleanup line? “If the government has had a good idea, we’ve been prepared to embrace it.” So those were the challenger’s objectives, and he ticked those boxes. After a bad opening week, the Labor campaign will certainly consider that a win, and the Sky News audience of swinging voters also gave Wednesday night’s encounter to the Labor leader. For his part “Scott” performed solidly enough, relentlessly on message as always, hungry for total domination as he always is, but careful not to burn too incandescently as he lunged for the last word. But “Scott” had two bad moments. The worst was when, attempting empathy, he told a woman with a child with a disability that he and Jenny were “blessed” to have two children without a disability. The woman asking the question had had her son’s package cut under the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Absolute howler. The second was a very obvious evasion of culpability – a wearisome trait that voters have seen on high rotation over the last three years. Morrison (under fresh pressure because of a decision by the Solomon Islands to sign a security pact with China), felt this (very poor) development (on his watch) wasn’t Australia’s (read, his) fault. This was all China’s fault. Labor was also in the mix. Morrison wondered why Labor was always taking China’s side. He was back adjacent to the Manchurian candidate nonsense that Canberra’s national security establishment correctly rebuked him about just a few weeks back – a reheat that felt more desperate than considered or smart. Albanese threw down a zinger in response. The government’s policy in our back yard was “not so much a Pacific step-up – it’s a Pacific stuff-up”. So those were the moments, and that was how it looked. But of more interest was how it was. The first thing to say is the questions from the audience were sharper and more substantive than most of the questions put to the two leaders over the past week and a half of the campaign. Voters wanted to know about housing affordability, the nursing workforce, the absent national integrity commission, funding packages under the national disability insurance scheme, the future of renewables and battery technology, the treatment of sole traders left out of jobkeeper during the pandemic, regional security, youth participation and the health of Australia’s democracy. Not one pop quiz about the unemployment rate (which dominated the first 72 hours of the campaign) or question about the life and times of the unfortunate Katherine Deves (which is continuing to dominate it). Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The final question of the night came from Clare. She asked: “The latest polling statistics show that voters have an all time low level of faith in the integrity of both major party politicians. What are you going to do to restore their trust in the democratic process?” Good question Clare. Given the seriousness of the times we live in, given Australia has lurched back into disaffection and disengagement and given that lurch is corrosive to the health of democracy, this is absolutely a question that needs answering. But “Scott” took Clare’s question as an opportunity to unleash his stump speech about economic management. “Our economic plan is about helping Australians realise their big aspirations in life, have their kids, to raise them, to give them a good education, to buy a home, to save for their retirement, to run a business and to have choices,” he said. “And that’s why this election is very much about who can run the economy and who can manage money. And following through on those plans, doing what we said we would do, ensuring we said we would get more Australians in their own homes.” Er, sorry, what? Fixing democracy one house at a time?

He offered two things – Labor would deliver a federal integrity commission, and if he won on 21 May, he would try to invest in some common ground. “I want to unite the country,” Albanese said. “I want to not be a prime minister who’s always looking for the wedge, always looking for the division, because if we’re going to move forward as a country, we need to work out our common interests.” Albanese said his objective would be to unite “instead of the constant argy-bargy which does seem to dominate a lot of our politics and I think you’re right, it’s putting people off.” Not perfect, that antidote, by any means.

4/20/2022,"Netflix’s share price has tumbled after it announced a net loss of 200,000 subscribers globally, and expects to lose a further two million over the next three months. It is the latest massive miss from a large technology company, and has sparked a flurry of fightback efforts. But can the streaming service really carry on growing forever? And do its plans for the future show confidence – or panic? The headline failure for Netflix is a reduction in subscribers for the first time in a decade. Wall Street analysts had been expecting it to announce growth of about 2.5 million new customers, and were stunned when the company instead confirmed more had cancelled than joined. Around the world, Netflix has 222 million subscribers. In its biggest markets, however, it has an appreciable portion of all households: in the US and Canada, 75m out of a total 142m households have a subscription to Netflix. When you add in password sharing, which Netflix says accounts for 30m additional households using the service in North America, it becomes clear the company is fighting for new signups from a rapidly shrinking pool of non-subscribers. Netflix has been increasing its monthly fees sharply around the world, with some UK subscribers now paying a third more than they were less than two years ago for the same service. But the company says it has been happy with the results, saying the rises “remain significantly revenue positive” – and thinks it still has “among the best retention in the industry”. Netflix also points out that, were it not for the war in Ukraine, it would actually have gained subscribers: it suspended services in Russia, losing 700,000 accounts in the process. However, Netflix is exploring the possibility of a soft price cut, in the form of an ad-supported tier, according to Reed Hastings, its chair and co-founder. A cheaper subscription funded by adverts could help expand Netflix into households and regions that had previously been unable to afford the service at full price, a move that has previously been roundly rejected by the company. Netflix estimates 100m households globally access its services through password sharing. For years, it has tacitly allowed the practice, which functions as an effective discount, even building it into its pricing structure with tiers of membership that allow for more devices streaming simultaneously. But now, it has started experimenting with stricter controls to try to turn some of those additional households into customers in their own right – particularly because, unlike homes that are not subscribed to Netflix at all, those shared users definitely have the right technology to use the service. In trials in some South American countries, Netflix has simply started to ask subscribers to pay a small additional fee, about $3 a month, if they share their service with people outside their household. The deeper question for the company is whether it needs to change its actual product, rather than simply fiddling with price points and subscription tiers. Unlike many of its competitors, Netflix has focused almost entirely on a relatively narrow slice of original and licensed film and TV. The approach has been praised for building up an extensive library of evergreen content that can drive new subscriptions, but has limited the service’s appeal in other areas. In contrast, competitors such as Amazon, Apple and Disney have looked to include sports, news and light entertainment in their wider packages. A 2018 report suggested Netflix was exploring news programming, but the company instead appears to have gone down other routes – launching a free gaming service for subscribers.",News/Media,Why is Netflix losing so many subscribers and what can it do about it?,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/20/why-is-netflix-losing-so-many-subscribers-and-what-can-it-do-about-it
4/20/2022,"Book now Our early ideas for a work of fiction often come to us randomly and without any obvious structure. This is natural - an inevitable first stage in the creative process. What happens beyond that stage depends on the writer’s ability firstly to identify patterns and possibilities in this raw material, and then to fashion the material into a strong and satisfying shape. In this weekend masterclass with novelists, teachers and co-authors of an inspiring new guide for fiction-writers, Jem Poster and Sarah Burton, you will be able to explore and enjoy that difficult but rewarding second stage of fiction writing. Through practical writing exercises and close reading of passages from other authors, you will gain valuable insights into this crucial aspect of the writer’s craft. Suitable for aspiring writers of fiction and those looking to brush up their skills, this supportive workshop with two of the finest authors and teachers working today will help you to energise your practice, gain a fuller understanding of structural possibilities, and develop the confidence to take your writing to the next stage.

4/20/2022,"Gothic chillers are rare in modern theatre but Stephen Mallatratt’s adaptation of Susan Hill’s novel The Woman in Black is still running in London 33 years after opening. Producers are understandably alert to the hope of making lightning strike twice. Daniel Evans, boss at Chichester, has commissioned Kate Mosse to adapt her blood-soaked mystery, set around the local West Sussex marshlands during the record wet spring of 1912. In The Taxidermist’s Daughter, Connie has taken over the stuffing of animals her father is too drunk to see. Shivers reliably build through ingredients including Connie’s elusive sense of childhood trauma, a creepy clique of town grandees, and mysterious women seen among the reeds – all against the escalating threat of what we now call an extreme weather event. Róisín McBrinn’s production – featuring violent moments going eyeball-to-eyeball with King Lear – is visually engulfing. A stage direction such as Mosse’s “the sea wall cracks” would once have relied on sound effects and audience goodwill. Now, Andrzej Goulding’s video design and Prema Mehta’s lighting flood the stage so terrifyingly that we almost fumble under seats for lifejackets. Paul Wills’s set is a lovely puzzle of rising and sliding parts, fluidly introducing medical and museum vitrines, homes, offices and coastland. Mosse’s main trade is impressive novels which may make her dialogue sometimes baldly explanatory – “I had an accident when I was a child. I don’t always remember” – in the way of a narrator’s usually candid relationship with the reader, rather than more ambiguous theatre speech, leaving actors space to grace-notes with voice and face. More subtext is generally what the piece needs: the story is always plotty and enjoyable but metaphors suggested by the dominant morbid imagery might have been pushed further in the script. As Connie, newcomer Daisy Prosper has charm and command in the difficult part of a central character who is usually less informed than the audience. Pearl Chanda as Cassie, a woman defined by mystery, avoids the floaty tone that such roles risk, finding psychological specificity. Raad Rawi’s distinguished but disconcerting Dr Woolston could have walked out of a Wilkie Collins story – as, in a sense, he has.
