2/1/2022,"Free public transit within Sydney’s central business district to encourage commuters to explore the city outside business hours is part of an ambitious CBD revitalisation plan the New South Wales government will consider. Under the plan, Indigenous culture and history would be better integrated into the cityscape for both locals and tourists, with Aboriginal languages and stories embedded into street signs, and Indigenous art in public spaces.  The ideas are key recommendations that will be delivered to the NSW government on Tuesday as part of the Future of the Sydney CBD report, a study conducted by global design and planning firm Arup with the Committee for Sydney and led by industry leaders across the business, academia, art and Indigenous communities. The Commission into the Future of the Sydney CBD was formed in late 2020, with the goal of improving Sydney’s liveability, creativity and investment issues that have existed both before and after the Covid pandemic. Of the 47 recommendations the NSW government will consider, key areas of focus include making the CBD an easier and more appealing destination to travel around and spend time in, embedding an Indigenous identity to the landscape, encouraging greater investment and reducing pollution. Light-centric art installations should also become a permanent CBD fixture, the commission believes, arguing it would harness the popularity of Sydney’s Vivid light festival and become a year-round attraction, and make the city safer. Popular pedestrian routes and crime data would be analysed to determine areas that would most benefit from permanent lighting installations. In addition to establishing a free transit zone from the harbourfront through Chinatown and down to the southern fringe of the CBD to encourage a “stay-a-while” mentality among office workers – similar to the free tram zone in Melbourne – the commission also recommends discounting travel into the city from suburban areas at night. Precincts in Sydney’s CBD should also be designated as different villages – similar to Wall Street and Broadway in New York – the commission argues, to allow areas with distinct characters to emerge. A permanent 24-hour fresh produce and street food marketplace as well as a public performance amphitheatre should also be established, and cultural institutions such as galleries should be funded to open late every night of the week, the report urges. While fostering a greater night-time economy has been a goal of NSW’s government since the reversal of the lockout laws, the commission also calls for measures to encourage more people to use the CBD during the daytime given the future of work-from-home conditions ushered in by the pandemic. The commission recommends more places for people to sit for free, including seating with tables and sufficient rain and shade cover, as well as exercise equipment and ping-pong tables. Childcare options within the CBD should also be heavily subsidised to encourage workers to come back into the office – however the commission recommends private employers pilot this initiative. Gabriel Metcalf, chief executive of the Committee for Sydney, said: “Sydney has one of the great CBDs in the world, but the question everyone’s trying to figure out now is what the changes from Covid are going to mean for it.” Metcalf said the city doesn’t need a wholesale reinvention, but rather “new layers – more reasons for more different kinds of people to visit and spend time in the city”. “That means doubling down on public space and amenity, really trying to make it a place centred on people and somewhere they can’t resist spending time,” he said. Stuart Ayres, the NSW minister for tourism, said the recommendations would complement the government’s existing revitalisation efforts, noting a $50m fund to woo people back into the CBD, which has already including a long lunch voucher scheme. Ayres said: “This is about transforming Sydney’s CBD from a nine-to-five workplace to a 24-hour global playground for innovation, entertainment and culture, and boosting new opportunities to attract investment and global talent.” While the NSW government has unveiled a $1bn support package for businesses following the explosion of the Covid over summer, the challenges facing the CBD following the Omicron wave are unclear. Movement data of Sydney commuters analysed during non-locked-down periods of 2021 found an emerging trend among workers to work from home on Monday and Friday and cluster their commuting days during the week.",News/Australia news,Ping-pong tables and free transit: plan to bring Sydney’s CBD back from the dead,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/01/ping-pong-tables-and-free-transit-plan-to-bring-sydneys-cbd-back-from-the-dead
2/1/2022,"We have experienced many bumps in the road since 2020 and one would have to be extremely brave to predict what the pandemic may throw at us next. But, in terms of the endgame, many experts believe Covid will eventually become an endemic disease.  However, what this actually means is a source of considerable confusion. One of the main reasons for this is a misunderstanding of endemicity itself, and what Covid being an endemic disease would actually look like in the real world. Let’s break it down. A disease is either epidemic or endemic. The most straightforward explanation of an epidemic disease is that it’s one in which the number of cases in the community is unusually large or unexpected. When this occurs, it signals a need for public health action to bring disease transmission under control. In the case of a pandemic – a worldwide epidemic – this occurs on a much larger scale. Depending on the infectiousness and severity of the disease, it can represent a global public health emergency, as we’ve seen with Covid. Covid has been a public health emergency. But it will eventually become an endemic disease. When you have the emergence of a completely new virus like SARS-CoV-2 that has the potential to cause severe illness while also being highly transmissible, the lack of any immunity among the population results in the drivers for disease spread being incredibly strong. A disease being epidemic indicates there’s an imbalance between these drivers of disease spread and the factors limiting spread in the community. In short, it means the drivers for disease spread overpower the factors limiting spread. As such, the disease spreads like a raging bushfire. It’s explosive and hard to bring under control once it has seeded. However, over time, the underlying forces driving an epidemic alter. As immunity begins to increase across the population – ideally in a controlled way by vaccination, but also by natural infection – the pathogen starts to run out of fuel and its ability to transmit falls. Pathogens can include a variety of microorganisms, such as viruses, bacteria and parasites. In this case, let’s assume we’re talking about a virus. On top of immunity, we can also reduce a virus’ ability to spread by behaviour changes, such as limiting contact with others, mask wearing and improved hand hygiene. In addition to lowering the virus’ ability to transmit, immunity also reduces its ability to cause disease, meaning fewer people become really sick or die. And finally, if we are lucky, over longer periods of time, the virus may also evolve to become intrinsically less severe. The net result of this is we move from an imbalance in terms of the forces driving disease to a more steady state of equilibrium. Instead of explosive and unpredictable disease spread, we reach a point where the presence of circulating disease represents a lower threat to the community than it did at the beginning of an epidemic. Transmission becomes more predictable, but not necessarily constant – we may still see some waves, especially seasonally. But these are expected and manageable. In short, we start to live alongside the virus. This is what we mean by an endemic disease. Examples of endemic diseases include the common cold, influenza and HIV/AIDS. The discussion around Covid becoming endemic becomes even more complicated by very different views about what this actually translates to in practice. It’s important to emphasise it doesn’t mean we drop our guard, surrender to the virus or downgrade the threat the virus poses to individuals and the community. We remain vigilant and respond to surges in cases when they occur, doing what’s needed to keep transmission as low as possible. Covid becoming endemic doesn’t mean it’s mild or that we give up. Importantly, a disease being considered endemic doesn’t mean we consider it mild. It just means it remains a part of our lives, and therefore we still protect the vulnerable from severe illness, as we do with other diseases. It’s crucial we understand living with the virus isn’t the same thing as ignoring the virus. Instead, it represents an adjustment in the way in which we respond to the disease. It’s also important to highlight this transition may not necessarily be smooth and there will no doubt be challenges along the way. One of the main obstacles we’re going to face is the possible emergence of new variants and how these will impact the infectiousness and severity of the disease. In order to reduce the likelihood of new variants emerging, it’s vital we really step up our rollout of vaccines globally to reduce virus transmission. To aid us in our transition to this next stage of the pandemic, we will, thankfully, be able to draw on many new weapons which are in the pipeline. This includes next-generation vaccines which will be more effective against the latest variants, or universal vaccines that cover all variants. We expect new vaccines will also be better at controlling transmission. We’ll also have ever-improving treatments, and better infection prevention and control engineered for specific environments. The big question, of course is when will this transition to endemicity happen? Many experts believe huge strides will be made along this path in 2022.

2/1/2022,"Police made an average of 669 child protection referrals to social services every day last year because of incidents of domestic abuse across England and Wales, a new analysis has disclosed. The NSPCC has found that data from Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) shows there were 244,197 referrals in 2020/21, an 8% increase from the previous year.  The findings come as Dominic Raab, the deputy prime minister and lord chancellor, has been urged by charities to ensure all child victims of domestic abuse have access to specialist, therapeutic services in the community to support their recovery. A consultation on the victims’ bill, which aims to improve the government’s response to the victims of crime, is due to close on 3 February. Police have warned that during the pandemic, many children were trapped in homes experiencing abuse and largely cut off from vital support networks during lockdowns. Several shocking cases were reported where toddlers and young children were killed despite social services being informed that they were in danger. Details emerged in December of the murder of six-year-old Arthur Labinjo-Hughes from Solihull, West Midlands, who was poisoned, starved and beaten during a campaign of abuse by his stepmother and father. Social workers, notified of bruising to the boy, found “no safeguarding concerns” despite visiting him two months before he was murdered. In the same month, a public outcry followed the case of Star Hobson, a 16-month-old who was murdered by her mother’s partner after months of “neglect, cruelty and injury” and despite five referrals from concerned family members to social services. Last week marked the start of children being officially recognised as victims of domestic abuse as part of the Domestic Abuse Act. The NSPCC hopes this will make it more likely that their needs are considered by professionals on the frontline such as social workers and police. The change to the law came after campaigning by charities to reflect the impact experiencing domestic abuse can have on children. The NSPCC said it can decimate a child’s confidence and sense of security and can have a devastating impact on their emotional wellbeing and mental health. Local authorities currently have a statutory duty to provide accommodation-based support services, such as refuges, when families and their children need to leave their homes to escape domestic abuse. But they do not have the same requirement to provide specialist, therapeutic services in the community for victims who remain at home after suffering domestic abuse. Provision of support is already patchy across the country, and without a legal obligation this could dwindle further in the future with cash-strapped councils diverting more resources to accommodation-based services despite the majority of victims using community-based services. Anna Edmundson, NSPCC head of policy and public affairs, said: “Domestic abuse can derail a childhood and it is unacceptable that support to recover remains patchy across the country, and what is available risks being axed by cash-strapped councils. “We urge Dominic Raab to use the ‘victim’s law’ to address this and ensure young victims of domestic abuse have easy access to professional services within their community so they can rebuild their lives no matter where they live.”",News/Society,Domestic abuse: average of 669 child protection referrals a day last year,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/01/domestic-abuse-average-of-669-child-protection-referrals-a-day-last-year
2/1/2022,"The players’ union, Fifpro, has called for a more holistic and coordinated approach to match calendars around the world after its new report found that professional players in the women’s game are suffering from “underloading” as a result of not playing often or consistently enough, competing in an average of 22 matches in the 2019-20 season. The 2021 annual workload study has found that, even at the very top of the women’s game, the low number of games is preventing the growth and development of players and the sport generally.  Data from 85 female players analysed by the Fifpro Player Workload Monitoring platform found that 14% of all minutes played by an average player came in non-competitive friendly matches, highlighting a lack of high-quality international club tournaments. The study found that players at the very top are hampered by long and quiet periods juxtaposed with bursts of overload in which they need to play an unusually high number of games in a short space of time. Fifpro’s director of global policy and strategic relations for women’s football, Sarah Gregorius, said: “One of the benefits of the international stakeholder environment in women’s football is that it’s actually pretty small and there are not that many leagues or competition organisers. “The confederations will put on a continental championship every four years and that will sometimes double up as World Cup or Olympic qualification. So, it doesn’t have to be a long conversation with lots of competing interests.” She added: “One thing the women’s football environment has inherited is that things exist in silos and that means that the expertise is a little bit diluted, and people aren’t used to talking to each other because some of the confederations don’t talk to each other and some of the political relations aren’t the best. “So, collaboration and the idea of forming a collective vision is challenging, but there’s also an opportunity. Everyone wants the players to be at their best, there’s enough space in the year and we can share, and it can be amicable.” The new report shows that 25% of match minutes for the players in the sample came from national teams, with international competition providing top-level games but also points out that this is not ideal as greater opportunities at club level provide more sustainable employment. There has been much talk of additions to the international calendar, with a potential biennial World Cup, a Club World Cup and a Europa League all touted by various stakeholders in the women’s game. Gregorius said it is “so important” that these discussions do not exist in isolation from each other and have a holistic approach to player welfare. “The World Cup, for example, let’s forget about how often it occurs, we see a stimulus and boom from it and it’s a wonderful platform. The important thing is to think about how we maximise what we do have and use any new competitions to better the game,” she said. “How can we use new competitions to stimulate participation in associations, professionalism of leagues and clubs and healthy investment into women’s football? I think Fifa and Uefa are starting to see the role they can play in the broader development of the industry and how competitions can boost that.”",Sport/Football,"Women’s game suffering from uneven schedule, says Fifpro union",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/01/womens-game-suffering-from-uneven-schedule-says-fifpro-union
2/1/2022,"Ministers are to unveil measures to raise educational standards in 55 English target areaswith persistently poor outcomes, including the promise of elite sixth-form colleges for talented children from disadvantaged backgrounds. The new “education investment areas” will form part of the government’s levelling-up white paper and will see resources focused on schools in the north, the Midlands, the east of England and the south-west for the next decade.  Ninety-five per cent of the areas that have been identified for “intensive support” are outside London and the south-east, and will include Rochdale, the Isle of Wight, Hartlepool, Walsall, Knowsley, Bury, Leeds, Luton, Norfolk and Sunderland. Labour’s education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, accused the government of recycling its 2017 opportunity areas policy. “The government is desperately trying to distract from the utter chaos at the heart of Downing Street by recycling old announcements, which shows the limits of the Conservatives’ ambition for Britain.” According to the plans, published on Tuesday, the government will also set a new goal of ensuring that 90% of children leaving primary school reach expected standards in reading, writing and maths by 2030 – in 2019 the figure was just 65%. Funding for the government’s plans is expected to come from the existing spending review settlement. Other measures will include retention payments to help schools keep high-quality teachers in priority subjects. Education investment areas will also be prioritised for new specialist sixth-form free schools “to ensure talented children from disadvantaged backgrounds have access to the highest standard of education this country offers”. In addition, schools in these areas that have been judged less than good in successive Ofsted inspections could be moved into multi-academy trusts, subject to a consultation later in the spring. The education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, said: “This white paper sets out our blueprint for putting skills, schools and families at the heart of levelling up. “It focuses on putting great schools in every part of the country, training that sets you up for success in a high-skilled, well-paid career, and ensuring no one misses out on opportunities simply because of where they live or their family background.” The package will also include a £560m “national youth guarantee” to provide young people with access to clubs, activities, adventures away from home and volunteering opportunities, an extra £200m for supporting vulnerable families, already outlined in the spending review, and skills training for an additional 200,000 people Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “Identifying 55 communities for intensive additional support sounds promising and we look forward to seeing exactly how this will work. We are not so sure about the idea of setting up ‘new elite sixth forms’. “This sounds like they will serve children who already do very well and could put pressure on existing provision when the simplest solution would surely be to improve the lamentable state of post-16 funding.” Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “Many of the areas now targeted for support have been among the hardest hit by education cuts over the last decade – on the government’s own watch, and entirely of its own making. “If the government was serious about levelling up education, then it would restore all the money it has cut from these schools.” Natalie Perera, chief executive of the Education Policy Institute (EPI) thinktank, said: “It will be important to closely scrutinise the criteria used by the government for selecting its education investment areas, and how it intends to deliver ‘intensive’ support over so many areas.”",News/Education,Move to improve education outcomes latest part of levelling-up plans,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/01/move-to-improve-education-outcomes-latest-part-of-levelling-up-plans
2/1/2022,"Liverpool were frustrated in their attempt to sign Fabio Carvalho from Fulham on deadline day despite being willing to pay up to £8.4m for the highly rated teenager. A day of complex negotiations between the clubs saw Fulham reject Liverpool’s opening offer of £5m for a player out of contract this summer. An agreement was eventually reached for the improved fee only for Liverpool to run out of time to conclude personal terms and conduct a medical with the 19-year-old. A proposal for Fulham to keep the player on loan for the rest of the season also brought complications.  Jürgen Klopp had brought forward interest in the Portugal-born winger, who can also operate as an attacking midfielder, given the fierce competition that is expected for his signature at the end of the season. Liverpool were prepared to hand a five-year contract to the England under-18 international, who has scored eight goals in 19 appearances for Marco Silva’s Championship leaders this season, but ultimately missed out on a second signing of the window after the arrival of Luis Díaz from Porto. A deal to bring Carvalho to Anfield could be revisited, however, with a pre-contract agreement possible that would allow the player to join once his Fulham contract expires. Liverpool did send the right-back Neco Williams on loan to Fulham for the rest of the season and, in other business with a promotion-chasing club, they allowed the central defender Nat Phillips to join Bournemouth on an identical basis. The 24-year-old Phillips has been the subject of widespread interest this month, with Liverpool receiving two bids of £7m plus inquiries from Newcastle and Leicester, but the prospect of more regular first-team football with Scott Parker’s side proved more attractive to the player and the club. Newcastle’s offer was a loan with a commitment to buy if they avoided relegation. Leicester also made an approach but Liverpool believed the defender would be only a back-up option for both Premier League suitors. Burnley were keen on Phillips in the event of James Tarkowski leaving but that has not materialised. Liverpool will receive a loan fee of £1.5m from Bournemouth plus an additional £250,000 if Parker’s team win promotion. Bournemouth underlined their determination to go back up to the Premier League by also signing the strikers Siriki Dembélé and Kieffer Moore, the midfielder Todd Cantwell and the goalkeeper Freddie Woodman. Dembélé arrived from Peterborough and Moore from Cardiff, both for undisclosed fees, Cantwell on loan from Norwich and Woodman on loan from Newcastle.",Sport/Football,Liverpool’s late push to sign Fabio Carvalho from Fulham ends in failure,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/31/liverpools-late-push-to-sign-fabio-carvalho-from-fulham-ends-in-failure
2/1/2022,"Another 92,000 Covid cases were reported for England on Monday, a steep rise on the day before, after reinfections were included in the statistics for the first time. Previously daily Covid case figures – which reflect the number of new infections picked up by testing – did not include reinfections for England, Scotland or Northern Ireland, although figures for Wales did, provided the positive tests were more than 42 days apart. In other words, most people were only counted once even if they had caught Covid multiple times.  However, as the pandemic has gone on, the absence of reinfections in case data led to concerns, with experts noting that a previous infection provides little protection against Omicron, while – two years into the pandemic – there is a bigger pool of people who have had Covid at least once before. Scientists noted that it was also important to include reinfections in order to understand the dynamics of the spread of immune-evasive variants that emerge, while it also sheds light on why some individuals may get infected over and over. “This is likely to be a combination of risk – due to exposure – plus inherent likelihood of becoming infected, once exposed,” said Prof Rowland Kao, an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh. “We need to know these things in order to better target interventions of various sorts – how important, for example, particularly workplaces are likely to be, and how some individuals are therefore going to be exposed to more risk.” The new approach means that reinfections will be now included in daily Covid case figures for England and Northern Ireland, with such episodes defined as a positive specimen at least 90 days after the last one – a gap that captures the majority of reinfections but ensures those who simply shed the virus for longer after an infection are excluded from the data. While data from the UK Health Security Agency suggests some reinfections may occur in a shorter time period, this is a relatively small proportion of potential reinfections. The Guardian understands data for cases in Scotland will also include reinfections in the coming weeks, while data for cases Wales will switch in the coming weeks to using the 90-day 90-day episode length. Under the current, mixed definitions in use, 92,368 new Covid cases were reported for the UK on Monday, up from 69,007 the day before, with 81,720 reported for England alone compared with 59,559 on Sunday before reinfections were included. The Guardian understands reinfections were not originally included in the daily case data across all the countries of the UK because at the beginning of the pandemic it was unclear whether they occurred and, if reinfections did happen, what the interval between infections was. While reinfection figures have since been tracked by public health bodies, and released in reports, the daily case figures have not – until now – included such episodes. While the inclusion of reinfections means the case-fatality risk – the proportion of people reported to be diagnosed with Covid who go on to die – will fall, Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at the University of Cambridge, cautioned the measure remains problematic. “We have always known that the daily number of reported cases was a substantial undercount of the actual number of infections – the ONS Covid Infection Survey shows that we have to at least double the daily count,” he said. “Including reinfections will be an improvement, and will reduce the apparent case-fatality rate, but nobody should have taken this very seriously anyway. The case-fatality ratio is inevitably an overestimate of what is the better measure – the infection fatality ratio, ie the proportion of those who are infected who die, whether or not they become confirmed cases.”",News/World news,Rise in Covid cases in England as reinfections included for first time,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/31/spike-in-covid-cases-in-england-as-reinfections-included-for-first-time

Alternatively, you could just ditch work today and spend the next several hours trying to recreate Rihanna’s pregnancy announcement photograph. Who could blame you?  It took wildlife photographer Dmitry Kokh almost two years to prepare for his trip to Wrangel Island, one of the few places where polar bears can be found in large numbers. When bad weather forced the expedition to stop near the small island of Kolyuchin, they discovered the bears had taken up residence in the island’s ruins. Is this a Phillip Pullman novel? Maybe, Kokh does say he “felt as if I was in a parallel universe”. What are the bears doing there? “No one knows why,” Kokh writes “but once every nine years the floating ice remains near the shore in summer. Consequently, the bears do not travel far to the north with the ice, as usual, and take up residence in the abandoned polar station.” How long will it take me to read?
