3/12/2022,"It was always clear in the aftermath of Emma Raducanu’s US Open victory that it would take time for her to adjust to the rigours of professional tennis, a process that has defined the start of her season. After struggling with a series of different ailments, Raducanu arrived in Indian Wells still recovering from a left leg injury sustained in Guadalajara last month. Days before the BNP Paribas Open began, she was not certain of her participation. But when Raducanu did step out on to the court on Friday, she was ready. The 19-year-old started by producing one of her best sets of tennis since New York and in the turbulent three-set match that followed, she toiled through to defeat Caroline Garcia 6-1, 3-6, 6-1 and reach the third round in Indian Wells. A reflection of the hype that still surrounds Raducanu came even before she played a single point. Despite Iga Swiatek, the third seed, and the former champion Simona Halep both competing on Friday, Raducanu was assigned the top Stadium 1 court ahead of them. She immediately made the most of her high billing, breaking Garcia’s serve in the opening game. Raducanu moved well from the beginning, soaked up Garcia’s greater weight of shot and counterpunched efficiently, constantly stepping inside the baseline to flip points from defence to attack. As Garcia, a former world No 4 who has cascaded down the rankings in recent years, began to impose herself consistently, Raducanu struggled to keep up. Her first and second serve speeds both dropped significantly and her passivity allowed Garcia to seize the initiative. However Raducanu maintained her composure and, at a pivotal moment at the beginning of the third set, moved back inside the baseline and arrested Garcia’s momentum with a great hold of serve before breezing to victory. “As soon as I let up and my racquet speed dropped, my ball speed dropped, she climbed on top of it straight away. I knew that I had to make some adjustments in the third set. I’m really happy that I was able to work that out in the match and come through a tough one,” Raducanu said. The victory marks Raducanu’s first WTA 1000 win and she has scuppered a run of five losses in six matches. Raducanu, who received a first round bye, will face the unseeded Petra Martic in the third round. Earlier in the day, Andy Murray pulled off a milestone victory in the first round of the BNP Paribas Open, clinching his 700th career ATP main draw win in a typically gritty match filled with resilience in absence of his top level. After losing the first set heavily and later trailing 3-1 in the final set, Murray recovered to defeat Taro Daniel of Japan 1-6, 6-2, 6-4. Murray will next face the 31st seed, Alexander Bublik of Kazhakstan. Only 17 other men’s players in the history of the sport have achieved 700 wins and only Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic have achieved it among active players. “It means a lot,” Murray told Amazon Prime. “It was a target I set myself towards the end of last year and with everything that has gone on the last few years it has not been easy to get there. Great achievement, not a lot of guys have been able to do that. I am really happy about it.”",Sport/Sport,Emma Raducanu overcomes rocky patch to reach Indian Wells third round,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/11/andy-murray-roars-back-at-indian-wells-to-bring-up-700th-career-victory
3/12/2022,"Russia has moved to block Instagram after its parent company, Meta, said it would allow calls for violence against Vladimir Putin and Russian soldiers involved in the invasion of Ukraine to appear on the social media platform. Russian prosecutors demanded that access to Instagram be blocked on Friday after media reports of the relaxation of its policies on hate speech related to the war. Russia’s general prosecutor’s office said in a statement it had moved to recognise Meta as an “extremist organisation and ban its activities on the territory of Russia”, claiming the platform had also been used to incite “mass riots accompanied by violence”. Several Russian regional governors also deleted their Instagram accounts on Friday, the RIA Novosti state news agency reported. Meta is also the parent company of Facebook, which the Russian government blocked access to last week, and WhatsApp, one of Russia’s most popular messaging applications. It is not yet clear if WhatsApp will also be targeted by government regulators. The crackdown on the social media giant will further limit most Russians’ access to outside information on the war, increasing the influence of state media. Putin last week signed off on new legislation that threatens Russians accused of sharing “fake information” about the war to up to 15 years in prison. Meta’s decision to allow speech targeting Russians is part of an extraordinary wave of corporate activism over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with hundreds of brands exiting the Russian market. The invasion has led to thousands of deaths and created a refugee crisis in Europe with more than 2 million people fleeing Ukraine after just two weeks of war. On Friday evening, Meta’s head of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said the company’s changes on speech would only apply in Ukraine itself. He that the policies were “focused on protecting people’s rights to speech as an expression of self-defence in reaction to a military invasion of their country.” He said the company had “no quarrel with the Russian people” and there was not a change on hate speech “as far as the Russian people are concerned”. He said the changes were temporary and the situation would be kept under review. “As a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine we have temporarily made allowances for forms of political expression that would normally violate our rules like violent speech such as ‘death to the Russian invaders’. We still won’t allow credible calls for violence against Russian civilians,” a Meta spokesperson said in an earlier statement, according to Reuters. In an email recently sent to moderators, Meta highlighted a change in its hate speech policy pertaining both to Russian soldiers and to Russians in the context of the invasion, Reuters reported. “We are issuing a spirit-of-the-policy allowance to allow T1 violent speech that would otherwise be removed under the hate speech policy when: (a) targeting Russian soldiers, except prisoners of war, or (b) targeting Russians where it’s clear that the context is the Russian invasion of Ukraine (eg content mentions the invasion, self-defence, etc),” it said in the email.",News/World news,Russia to block Instagram after Meta relaxes stance on Putin hate speech,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/russia-to-block-instagram-after-meta-relaxes-putin-hate-speech
3/12/2022,"Another step negotiated by New France, as they progress to their own World Cup next year – and, before that, a date with their bitterest enemy, everyone’s bitterest enemy in rugby’s small world, England in Paris next weekend. Another successful step there, and a grand slam will be theirs, a first since 2010, a first title since 2010, a dozen years, long and barren. That said, this notion that France are in a different class to les autres suffered a few cracks. Wales, after a torrid start, the like of which France are increasingly adept at inflicting, were comfortably the equal of their vaunted visitors. They are beginning to reassemble a more familiar pack, Taulupe Faletau a second game into his return and looking all the more magnificent for it, but their front five, in particular, remains raw. Well, they stood up handsomely against the monstrous French pack. With only small adjustments to the dread reality of What Actually Happened, Wales might have won – and no one could possibly have argued with it. But the hated Friday night slot, the cauldron of Cardiff – albeit shorn of nearly a fifth of its usual number – there were more than enough ingredients to render this latest step exactly the kind any temperamental France side might have slipped on in the past. That France, ultimately, did not is to their credit, as of course is the little burst of panache that proved the difference. Against Ireland, against Scotland and now against Wales, France have distinguished themselves by simply outplaying their opponents in that special period of the game when the lungs are full, the passions high, the excuses low – those first 10 minutes. The game’s only try was scored in the ninth minute, and a beauty it was. In it lay the reasons for this France team’s lionisation. Melvyn Jaminet is almost as much the embodiment of this generation as his more celebrated teammates at half-back. The full-back is worth his place for his goal-kicking alone, but his elegance in attack is very French, as are the lingering question marks over his authority when the game is not quite going France’s way. Both were in evidence here, but the elegance won out because of those golden minutes in France’s opening. Jaminet it was who ran back a loose Welsh kick, finding a gap and releasing Gabin Villiere on the left. The ball went right, but when the sweetest of handling sequences brought it back left again, Jaminet beat another outside shoulder to send Anthony Jelonch striding over. Should we be impressed the try was all France would need in the end, with only another penalty, the only score of the second half, the extent of their proceeds from the subsequent 70 minutes? Or should England, for example, be encouraged that there remains ample scope to ruffle them? Certainly, if Jaminet, Antoine Dupont, Romain Ntamack and the like are the bellwethers of the side, unplayable when on form, there is reason to think questions might still be asked of their authority. Not even Dan Biggar’s mum would claim that he is more talented than his opposite number, Ntamack, but when it comes to the imposition of personality on a contest, few are more forceful. If Wales felt they had done more than enough to win, it is because we came away more aware of the role played by Biggar, Faletau, Liam Williams et al than that played by their opponents beyond those opening minutes. What does that matter? Wales did not win. They had their moments in the second half, one golden opportunity to score a try about as consummate as that scored by France spilled agonisingly by another returning veteran, Jonathan Davies. Biggar’s cross-kick was classy, Faletau’s catch of it on the run and inside ball to die for, but Davies could not hold the pass. A try then and the questions over this young French team would have become louder. But there was no try then. Nor again when Wales were held up after yet another siege of the French line. Does that mean the questions are invalid? Or does it mean they are just yet to be asked? Roll on, next weekend in Paris....

3/12/2022,"Ralf Rangnick denied Marcus Rashford has not had enough game-time under him, with Manchester United’s interim manager stating the forward is free to consider leaving in the summer if he wishes. The 24-year-old is thinking about whether to depart because he is unhappy at his number of minutes since Rangnick took over in November. Rashford did not start Sunday’s 4-1 loss at Manchester City, which was the fourth consecutive league match he has been a substitute, though he was in the XI that drew at Atlético Madrid a fortnight ago. In all Rashford has made 10 starts and been a replacement four times under the German. With Rashford having scored only five goals in 24 appearances this season, Rangnick was asked whether, as his recent lack of minutes is due to his poor form, it should be incumbent on the 24-year-old to show the manager what he can do. “I don’t think that he’s not had enough game time,” said the 63-year-old. “He’s had 13-14 games since I’ve been here now, he played more games from the start than he didn’t play from the start. “I don’t think this is an issue and he never said anything about that since we spoke yesterday [Thursday]. But the [transfer] window is closed now. Even suppose he and his agents or his family at one stage of the summer think about maybe going to another club, well then he can do that but in the summer. Now the window is closed. It’s got nothing to do with tomorrow’s game [v Tottenham] or the game on Tuesday [Atletico Madrid]. “I spoke with him yesterday and the day before so I don’t know anything about him being unhappy. He didn’t say anything to me, he said to me that he is still happy and that he wants to perform on a high level for the club. There was no mention of him not being happy here.” Cristiano Ronaldo has recovered from injury, the striker having flown to Portugal last weekend as he was not available for the City match. Rangnick was not aware the 37-year-old had done so. “I didn’t know anything about that trip,” he said. “It doesn’t make sense now to waste energy and deal with it because the games we have to play now are too important. I decided to put my focus on the upcoming games and not waste any energy with things that happened in the last six or seven days.” Asked if Ronaldo is happy at United, Rangnick said: “I haven’t asked him if he’s happy at Manchester, at this club, he’s fit again, resumed training yesterday and we shall see which formation we will line up with tomorrow.” Edinson Cavani is also fit again following injury.",Sport/Football,Rangnick says Rashford free to leave United if game-time is a problem,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/11/rangnick-says-rashford-free-to-leave-united-if-game-time-is-a-problem
3/12/2022,"Frank Lampard defended Everton’s players against accusations that they do not care but described their 5-0 thrashing at Tottenham as an eye-opener that must jolt them into life in their relegation battle. Everton’s seventh loss in eight league games was the heaviest defeat of Lampard’s managerial career and brought fierce criticism of an underachieving team who could drop into the bottom three on Saturday before they face Wolves on Sunday. Lampard hopes to address the culture of negativity among the supporters, saying he “smelled it”, but accepted that his team have to prove their commitment on the pitch after an abject display on Monday. “It was a bit eye-opening for me,” he said. “That performance should be a jolt for everybody. I understand that if you are a fan of a club or work around a club and have seen it before then it is something that very easily can become really negative really quickly. And we can’t be negative. That’s my job now: to build players up and get them positive. Not be a cheerleader because there has to be some reality. “I don’t want to build up players for no reason. But what I do see – and I’m generalising – is a group of lads who do care. There is no doubt about that. We’re 17th for a reason: before I got here. So we need to understand that I am not painting a pretty picture of a load of lads who care and it’s all going to be fine, I’m painting a picture that I know that they care but, proactively, what are they going to do about it?” Lampard realises that changing the team’s reputation and bringing greater patience among fans is a long-term task, but in the short term he is encouraging his players to avoid the damning verdicts on social media unless they can cope with them. “To change that idea and culture is certainly something I want to do,” he said. “It’s not an easy process. It doesn’t come just from saying it and flicking a switch. Fortunately, I do not go on social media but the players do. If they are, they are going to have to deal with it and that is not easy. I remember I used to read the marks out of 10 in the newspapers 20 years ago when I was playing for England and I got five, and it was not nice at all. Now it is on a different level to that.”",Sport/Football,Frank Lampard backs Everton players after fierce criticism of defeat by Spurs,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/11/frank-lampard-backs-everton-players-after-fierce-criticism-of-defeat-by-spurs
3/12/2022,"Antonio Conte has suggested he would be open to extending his contract at Tottenham if the club can show “good vision” and make “big, big improvements”. The manager sparked fears he could be ready to quit after the 1-0 defeat at Burnley on 23 February, saying he could not go on like this and questioning whether he was the person to improve the situation. Conte is nothing if not emotional and, reflecting on the period since the winter break at the end of January – one defined by soaring highs and crushing lows – he said that the team had got better. The January transfer window, when the club added the midfielders Rodrigo Bentancur and Dejan Kulusevski, was a step in the right direction and Conte is determined to build on it with further additions in the summer. Before then, he also wants to develop his working relationship with the club. Conte joined last November on a contract until June 2023. There is the option to extend and he was asked whether he may do so as it would show his commitment to everybody, including prospective signings. “In this moment there is only one truth and [it is] I am committed with this club for another year,” Conte said. “The club wanted this situation and I accepted because it was good to know each other [first]. After four and a half months, the club understood my way to work and I understood the club. We now have three months to the end of the season to continue to improve this knowledge of each other and then to find the best solution for both. “I am enjoying to work for this club. My ambition is to fight to be competitive, to fight to win. I know my soul, my heart and my mind wants this. I hope that we can match these two situations. “It will be very important to have a good vision. In January, we showed that we have just started to improve the situation. To fight to win the league or to stay in the top four, we need a big, big improvement and we have started to do this with these players. We are improving a lot. But you need in the future to have other important steps. And to have the ambition with facts and not only with words.” Spurs are seventh, three points behind fourth-placed Arsenal having played one game more, and they face Manchester United at Old Trafford on Saturday evening. Conte continues to rate United as being among the division’s top four teams, alongside Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea, who occupy the first three places. He said that Spurs had to hope one of them, presumably United, finished outside the top four but he has become more comfortable in talking up his club’s Champions League aspirations. “I have improved our level of ambition as now I am asking my players to fight for this target,” Conte said. “I want to put the pressure on myself and the whole environment because the players deserve this type of pressure. It has to be a good pressure. “We are ready. We are ready to fight, to play our cards and see what happens. It would be outstanding for us to win a Champions League [place] because, don’t forget, this season for Tottenham was very difficult for many, many aspects.”",Sport/Football,Conte willing to consider extending Tottenham contract if club show ‘vision’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/11/antonio-conte-willing-to-consider-extending-tottenham-contract-if-club-show-vision
3/12/2022,"Jürgen Klopp has urged Liverpool to “write a special story” by becoming champions in a manner that can make them proud when they are old. Liverpool can cut the gap to Manchester City to three points overnight with victory at Brighton on Saturday and play their game in hand on the leaders when they visit Arsenal on Wednesday. Klopp’s side were 14 points behind City in January but have won their past seven league games. They have a habit of finishing seasons strongly under the German and he is eyeing another improbable chapter in his reign. “We want to write a special story here, not only this year but in general,” he said. “If you want to look back later in life on very successful times, you should give absolutely everything now. We have no time and no points to waste. We have to keep going, that is clear, and if there is any kind of momentum we should keep it and work with it. “We cannot call it a title race because we are still behind but we have to win football matches but everybody is excited about having the opportunity to have a title race. So far the boys did really well and why should I think we can’t go on?” Klopp hopes Liverpool can benefit from their experience of high-pressure run-ins. “We don’t feel sorry for ourselves; not at all,” he said. “We are used to it. Last season when we wanted to qualify for the Champions League, we had to win all the games in the last weeks. We found ourselves quite frequently in similar situations. I don’t know why it always happens to us. There was one year where we were champions [with games to spare]. All the others were full throttle to the end.” Liverpool suffered only their third defeat in 53 matches in all competitions against Internazionale on Tuesday, albeit while progressing to the Champions League quarter-finals, and Klopp said: “I give usually after a game a little speech in the dressing room. Most of the time it is quite nice but I realised after the game I am in a better mood than the players. My first thought was we are through against tough opponents and their first thought was we lost.” Naby Keïta is set to bring up a century of Liverpool appearances on Saturday. The midfielder’s contract expires next year and although Klopp suggested there was no development in talks about a new deal, he sounded keen to keep him. “Naby’s future will be great,” he said. “He is an exceptional footballer. One hundred is an impressive number but it could have been more games because he is unfortunately sometimes injured. I think of the 100 games he played, 80 were really good ones and that is good.”",Sport/Football,‘Write a special story’: Klopp urges Liverpool to go full throttle for title,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/11/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-title-special-story
3/12/2022,"The UN security council met on Friday at Russia’s request to discuss Moscow’s claims that the US is funding “military biological activities” in Ukraine – in other words, secretly developing biological weapons in Ukrainian laboratories. The event saw some heated discussion. The Russian ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, evoked the terrifying specter of an “uncontrolled spread of bio agents from Ukraine” across Europe. His American counterpart, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, warned that Russia’s claim could be a pretext for it launching its own biological weapons attack on Ukraine. So what is the dispute all about, and what is actually happening inside Ukraine? How did “bio labs” become the latest front in the Ukraine information war? Last Sunday the Russian ministry of foreign affairs posted a tweet accusing the US and Ukrainian governments of running a secret “military-biological programme” inside the stricken country. Moscow claimed that its invading forces had discovered evidence of an “emergency clean-up” to hide the programme. Moscow went on to claim that it had found documents related to the secret US operation in laboratories in the Ukrainian cities of Kharkiv and Poltava. The allegations were quickly amplified by China, which supported the claims during Friday’s UN security council debate. The theory also took on a life of its own on social media under the hashtag #usbiolabs, and found a welcome home among rightwing outlets in the US including the War Room podcast of Donald Trump’s former White House adviser Steve Bannon and the Fox News primetime show hosted by Tucker Carlson. How have the US and Ukrainian governments responded? Both the US and Ukraine have categorically denied that they are developing any biological weapons inside the country. At Friday’s meeting, the US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said: “I will say this once: ‘Ukraine does not have a biological weapons program.’” She went on to turn the accusation back on Moscow. “It is Russia that has long maintained a biological weapon program in violation of international law.” Ukraine’s ambassador to the world body, Sergiy Kyslytsya, used more colourful language. He called the idea being advanced by Russia “a bunch of insane delirium”. What are independent world bodies saying? The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it is unaware of activity by Ukraine violating any international treaty, including the ban on biological weapons. The UN high commissioner for disarmament, Izumi Nakamitsu, confirmed that the UN was not aware of any biological weapons programmes in Ukraine. Nakamitsu pointed to the Biological Weapons Convention, which has prohibited the development and use of biological weapons since 1975. The convention was backed by then president Richard Nixon, who in 1969 also put a stop to the US developing its own offensive biological weapons. So do bio labs exist inside Ukraine, and is the US supporting them? Yes, and yes. Ukraine does operate biological laboratories which receive US funding. The US undersecretary of state Victoria Nuland affirmed those facts in a Senate foreign relations committee hearing this week in which the Republican senator Marco Rubio asked her directly whether Ukraine had biological weapons. Nuland did not answer the question head on. “Ukraine has biological research facilities,” she replied, adding that there was concern that Russian forces were trying to gain control of the labs. “We are working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces.” Nuland’s comments were seized upon by far-right commentators as further evidence of a secret US-Ukraine plot. In fact, US funding to the laboratories had its roots in the fall of the Soviet Union after which money was pumped into Ukraine and other former Soviet countries to help them transfer scientific skills away from weapons programmes towards public health initiatives. The scheme was originally known as the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) programme, but is now more commonly referred to as the biological engagement programme. It has been successful in supporting former Soviet and other countries to fulfil public health obligations. “This is one of the best things that we do,” Dr Gigi Gronvall, senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told the Guardian. Most of the work of the Ukraine labs today, Gronvall said, involved surveillance of diseases in animals and people as an early-warning system for illnesses such as African swine fever, which is endemic in the region. “We know pathogens don’t respect borders, so helping to put out public health fires before they become too big is an advantage to all of us,” she said. Do the Ukraine laboratories store dangerous biological agents? Yes, it appears so. As part of their work researching diseases the bio labs do seem to hold dangerous pathogens. We know that because WHO is urging Ukraine to destroy any highly dangerous agents in its laboratories to avoid the risk of a disastrous outbreak should one of the labs be hit under Russian attack. “As part of this work, WHO has strongly recommended to the ministry ofhealth in Ukraine and other responsible bodies to destroy high-threatpathogens to prevent any potential spills,” the UN health agency said. The WHO has worked in Ukraine for several years helping the bio labs improve their safety and security, so it knows what it is talking about. If Russian claims of a secret bioweapons programme are fake news, does that mean there is nothing to worry about? No. In addition to the threat of pathogens held in Ukrainian labs leaking out or falling into the hands of Russian forces, there is the threat of Russia potentially launching its own biological weapons attack. The assessment of the US state department is that Russia continues to maintain an offensive biological weapons programme in violation of the convention that it has signed. Earlier this week, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, accused Russia under Vladimir Putin of having a “long and well-documented track record” of using chemical weapons, pointing to the poisoning of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny and Russia’s support of the Syrian regime while it deployed chemical weapons. She went on to warn that Moscow’s claim of a secret biological weapons programme in Ukraine could in fact be laying the foundations for a Russian chemical or biological weapons assault inside Ukraine. That possibility leaves even seasoned experts rattled. “I hope that this is more of a disinformation talking point than an actual thing,” Gronvall said. “I guess we shall see.”",News/World news,What are Russia’s biological weapons claims and what’s actually happening?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/russia-biological-weapon-claim-us-un-ukraine-bio-labs-explainer
3/12/2022,"On the eve of the first Test, at the ground that carries his name, the great Sir Vivian Richards was asked about the absence of Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad but instead decided to largely ignore the question and deliver a hymn of praise for Zak Crawley. “A magnificent player,” purred Richards, urging England to give the 24-year-old time to flourish; to accept that, as a tall right-hander with an array of attacking shots at the top of the order, the first phase of his Test career may be hit and miss. The talents that caught the eye of Richards were in evidence on the fourth day, Crawley strumming his second century for England that, along with 84 not out for Joe Root, gave England control of the match heading into the final day. The tourists closed on 217 for one from 63.2 overs when rain lashed down at 5pm local time, having given themselves a sniff of victory through a lead of 153, even if the draw is clearly the heavy favourite on this moribund pitch. Trickier surfaces lie ahead but Crawley’s elegant unbeaten 117 from 200 balls should do plenty for his confidence, having gone 21 innings without a three-figure score since his 267 against Pakistan in 2020. The smile upon reaching the milestone here, nudging Jayden Seales into the leg-side for two precious runs after tea and delighting the visiting supporters with it, suggested as much. “It means an awful lot,” Crawley said. “It’s been a while since my last one and there were times last year when I didn’t think I’d get another. We are going to try and win the Test match. It’s something we’ll discuss but I think we’ll want a minimum of 65-70 overs at them.” An unbroken second-wicket stand of 193 from 52.1 overs between Crawley and his captain also represented a boon for a top order that was shredded in Australia and last year found itself five down for 67 runs or fewer on eight occasions. So while conditions helped hugely, there was still pressure here. Winkling out the final West Indies wicket first thing – the hosts finally bowled out for 375 from 157 gruelling overs – England were staring at a deficit of 64 runs. In light of those recent struggles, one could not rule out the possibility of faces being left as red as some of those among the Barmy Army. There was an inauspicious start to their innings too, Crawley’s new opening partner, Alex Lees, seeing his Test debut end with scores of four and six. For the second time in the match, Kemar Roach followed a succession of outswingers to the left-hander with one that speared into his front pad. Having seen seven decisions overturned by this point in the contest, Lees reviewed instantly but instead became the first England opener to make two single-figure scores on his debut since Hugh Morris in 1991; at least historical comfort can be drawn from the fact that the last Yorkshire-born cricketer on this list was one Len Hutton in 1937. He went OK. With this came the end of England’s third-highest opening partnership of the winter – just 24 runs – but Root strode out in his new position back at No 3 and soon quelled any concerns, with he and Crawley calmly pushing their side into the lead by lunch, reaching 72 for one, and then 146 for one by tea. The runs came quicker than the previous day and the West Indies attack were left searching for answers once the ball went soft. Crawley was in murderous mood when they strayed, his 16 fours crisply struck either square of the wicket or behind, taking 100 balls to reach his half-century and then 81 more to double it. Even on a road, his execution was still reward for those present. It was the left-arm spin of Axar Patel that led to Crawley’s career stalling in India last year but with the pitch failing to break up here, his equivalent, Veerasammy Permaul, could offer no such threat. When Kraigg Brathwaite then started bowling his achingly slow off-spin from the other end, freebies were in abundance and both set batsmen helped themselves. Having earlier overturned an lbw shout from Roach with the new ball, the only other heart in mouth moment came when Crawley was on 71 and a flick to leg off Permaul ended up in the hands of slip. West Indies went up, convinced it had struck his boot on the full before the catch. But with an on-field ‘soft-signal’ of not out, the TV umpire, Leslie Reifer, did not have conclusive evidence to give it. Otherwise it was a cruise for Crawley and Root, and perhaps a degree of vindication for the bowlers who 24 hours earlier had toiled in the absence of Mark Wood; a bit like Spike Milligan’s epitaph on his gravestone: “I told you I was ill”. For England there was still optimism that Wood may be able to bowl on the fifth day after the elbow injury that has sparked fears over his continuation in this three-Test series. Whether this would be wise, given the likelihood of a stalemate, is another matter.",Sport/Sport,Zak Crawley lives up to Viv Richards’ praise to wrest control from West Indies,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/11/west-indies-england-first-test-day-four-match-report
3/12/2022,"Everybody knew the sanctions were coming; they had been inevitable, according to UK government sources. Roman Abramovich, the Chelsea owner, was in their crosshairs because of his links to Vladimir Putin, which had moved beyond the pale after Russia’s senseless invasion of Ukraine. Abramovich himself knew they were coming. Hence his decision to try to sell his UK assets, including Chelsea. But when they did arrive at 9am on Thursday, they were still able to blindside the Chelsea hierarchy. On Wednesday, they had certainly not anticipated the imposition of them the following morning. The club entered a state of shock. So many questions, so few answers. Some of the players were concerned about what the future held for them – given that one of the measures involved Chelsea not being able to operate in the transfer market or offer new contracts. Ditto many members of staff. What did it all mean? As the day progressed, the Premier League’s chief executive, Richard Masters, sent an email to the clubs. It was still early, nothing felt concrete, but there was a business-as-usual tone to his note. Masters reassured everybody that Chelsea would complete their remaining fixtures of the season. The integrity of the competition would not be compromised and it was a theme picked up by Thomas Tuchel. “As long as we have enough shirts and as long as the bus is full of fuel we will arrive and we will be competitive,” the Chelsea manager said. The players have been told to concentrate on what they can influence, which they did on Thursday night with the 3-1 win at Norwich, keeping them third. Next is the visit of Newcastle to Stamford Bridge on Sunday which, it is fair to say, will be flavoured by ownership issues. But what kind of Chelsea will emerge from the sanctions which have set them on a path to ruin? The first thing to say is that the world and European champions, who have won 21 trophies since Abramovich’s takeover in 2003 – more than any other English club during the period – will surely not be put out of business, however hard the financial restrictions that have been brought against them appear. There is still time to find a buyer and for them to stabilise the operation, especially if the deal were done by 31 May – when the club’s special licence to carry on is due to expire. There remain plenty of interested parties, who can only see Chelsea’s price dropping as sponsors pull out or consider their associations; as revenue streams are hit. Moreover, the government, which is effectively in charge of the sale – given the sanctions against Abramovich would not allow him to profit from it – have an interest in the transaction going through. They want Abramovich out for obvious reasons, including the optics, and they do not want to send Chelsea to the wall as they consider the club to be of cultural significance to the country. If Abramovich were to remain as the owner into next season, with sanctions biting ever deeper, that could happen. Could Abramovich dig in and take the ship down with him? Given everything we know about him and his love for Chelsea, his desire to hand over to responsible owners, it feels unlikely. And, in any case, the government have reserved the right to requisition the club, as a last resort, and sell it themselves. They have given Abramovich no room for manoeuvre, forcing him away, and, if there is financial pain for the club, it is at a level they believe they will get through. On a related point, as Chelsea potentially encounter difficulties in satisfying the league’s profit and sustainability rules, there does not seem to be a desire among the other clubs for them to be driven under. They recognise that a strong Chelsea is important for the collective brand. The league, meanwhile, is always loth to create a mess with points deductions, for example. Again, it is not good for the competition. If Chelsea were to fall foul of profit and sustainability, they would be expected to cite unforeseen circumstances, much as some clubs have claimed Covid writedowns: their books would have been sound but for the pandemic. Chelsea continue to try to process the sanctions and argue against some of them. Many areas of the business stand to be affected, with the government wanting to ensure that any revenue generated by the club cannot find its way back to the Putin regime. A part of the nervousness at Chelsea involves whether any more sponsors will follow the telecommunications and internet service provider Three in withdrawing support, at least temporarily. There are normally anti-embarrassment clauses in such arrangements and, from a corporate social responsibility point of view, the upside of standing by a tarnished individual is often outweighed by the downside. The Three deal is worth £40m a year, although it is unclear how much more, if anything, was due to Chelsea before the end of the season. The kit contract with Nike is the big one – it is worth £60m a year. The ticketing and merchandising sanctions should not hit too hard, as the end of the season looms, but there could be larger holes with the final portion of the broadcast deal and the prize money from the Premier League and Uefa to be frozen. If Chelsea were to finish third in the league, it would be worth about £34m. Then there are the sums that Abramovich would be permitted to invest within the parameters of the profit and sustainability rules – £105m over a rolling three-year period. That, plainly, has stopped and so, to repeat, it is imperative that the transfer of ownership happens with a degree of speed. What is clear is that Chelsea will live a different reality without Abramovich and there is a strong chance that it will not be as exciting. In football terms, he was the ideal owner: no money constraints; an individual motivated purely by aggrandisement, to succeed year after year. Abramovich’s day of reckoning has come. Chelsea have the memories and the conflicting emotions.",Sport/Football,Chelsea are in crisis but there is no will to leave club on their knees | David Hytner,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/11/chelsea-in-crisis-but-there-is-no-will-to-leave-club-on-their-knees-roman-abramovich
3/12/2022,"Four down, one to go. France’s mission for the grand slam rumbles on, and they remain on course for a first Six Nations title since 2010, but how Wales made them work for it. Les Bleus had been fancied to dominate the defending champions but, as they have demonstrated so often, the Welsh are not easily intimidated. A clinical early try by Anthony Jelonch ultimately proved decisive but the life was very nearly squeezed from the French attempt at a clean sweep in what became, as the Wales captain, Dan Biggar, said, “an arm-wrestle and a slug-fest”. That France emerged victorious is testament to their spirit and work-rate, and to the defence coach, Shaun Edwards, who helped to mastermind so many memorable Welsh successes here in the past. France’s winning streak began when they denied Wales the grand slam in Paris with a late try nearly a year ago. “Frustrated, annoyed, disappointed, all those things,” said Biggar, whose perceptive kicking from hand played a major part in making this such a deeply uncomfortable night for France. “I said in the [post-match] huddle, we would have been a bit fortunate to nick it at Twickenham a couple of weeks ago, but tonight we were the better team for long periods. Big Test matches like that hinge on one or two moments, and we didn’t quite nail ours.” France looked dangerous from the off. Antoine Dupont ghosted through a gap and the scrum-half offloaded to the giant second row Paul Willemse. Josh Navidi, restored to the back row at No 7 alongside Taulupe Faletau at No 8, was penalised at a ruck and Melvyn Jaminet caressed a penalty through the posts. Biggar immediately levelled from the tee when France were punished for obstruction. When the lively Toulon wing Gabin Villière made a dart on the French left, the Welsh defence initially reset, but even a thunderous hit by Ryan Elias could not prevent France crossing the try-line. Jaminet ruthlessly capitalised on an overlap, offloading to Jelonch, who jogged over. Jaminet himself converted and it was an ominously effective score from a Welsh perspective. Would Wales roll over? Of course they wouldn’t – even if they lost Tomos Williams, the scrum-half, who took a heavy blow to the head in trying to tackle Jonathan Danty. Another Biggar penalty reduced what had become a seven-point deficit after the wing Alex Cuthbert kicked ahead. The Welsh passing game started to fizz, while powerful carries by Navidi and Faletau began to punch a hole or two. Having started like a runaway train, France were suddenly under pressure. A stunning 50-22 touch-finding kick by Biggar bought the field position for another penalty, making it a one-point game. Jaminet’s limp attempt at a drop goal from distance, bringing the first half to a close, demonstrated the stress that Fabien Galthié’s side had been under. But they seemed refocused after half-time. Jaminet cracked over a penalty to edge France four points in front. A tense, otherwise scoreless third quarter ensued, punctuated by a singing competition between the Welsh and French fans, battling each other to produce the loudest volume as a nervous finish beckoned. France nursed their four-point advantage into the final quarter – but invited pressure on to themselves when Danty knocked on and gifted the hosts a scrum on the visitors’ 22. They escaped with their slender lead intact and were soon threatening at the other end, the fly-half Romain Ntamack drifting an attempted drop goal narrowly wide as Galthié’s men continued to search for the decisive score. It took on the shape of a match that France would surely have lost before Edwards instilled such discipline in their defensive ranks. Thibaud Flament of Toulouse, fresh from the replacements’ bench, was arguably fortunate to escape a yellow card after tipping the wing Josh Adams over. Faletau, bursting with intent and industry, sprinted into space on the right. The French kept tackling and kept their shape. Wales steamed forward into the French 22 one last time only to see a brilliant interception by Ntamack relieve the pressure. Jaminet missed a late kick at goal but it did not matter. Relief, as well as elation, characterised the celebrations from the French players. Now for England in Paris next Saturday. “Now we can start mentioning the grand slam,” Dupont said, after being kept unusually quiet by the swarming Welsh defence but still, perhaps needless to say, having shown flashes of his trademark brilliance. “The media are going to talk about it. But we’re going to focus on ourselves.”",Sport/Sport,Anthony Jelonch’s try keeps France’s grand slam dreams alive against Wales,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/11/wales-france-six-nations-match-report

3/12/2022,"The internet always knows what you want. This week a particular video clip has been popping up in those wormholes filled with adverts at the side of my screen, pressing its nose up against the glass for hours on end like an unhappy cat mewling at the window. Alan Shearer slams Roman Abramovich over Ukraine statement. There it is again. And here is the text of Alan’s actual slamming: “There’s still no condemnation from Roman or the club about what’s happening in Ukraine.” It is a robust and sincere statement, deserving of serious treatment. So let’s break this down. Alan Shearer has clearly looked at the facts. And he has decided that the invasion of a neighbouring state, the bombing of civilians, the use of advanced weaponry: all of this is unacceptable. By extension, for an English football club to be owned by someone complicit in such crimes, well that is unacceptable too. This is non-negotiable. As Alan Shearer rightly states, we cannot have our football clubs tarnished, sullied, or linked with regimes that may be guilty of such crimes. At which point three possibilities present themselves. Alan Shearer has never heard of the war in Yemen. Alan Shearer is unaware of who Mohammed bin Salman is, or what he does as his main day job. Or third, Alan Shearer is wiling to overlook both of these things because he really likes and cares about Newcastle United. And sadly at this point the world does start to intrude. It isn’t hard to make the connection here. Newcastle United are owned by a fund that is governed by a state. And that state is also, like Vladimir Putin’s Russia, involved in the bloodstained invasion of a neighbouring state. For the last seven years Saudi Arabia has been waging a war that has led to the deaths of an estimated quarter of a million people, not to mention famine, chaos and societal collapse. The organisation Human Rights Watch has called for an investigation into the role of Mohammed bin Salman – who, to be clear, manages the fund that runs Newcastle United - for alleged war crimes. And yet instead of calling out, say, Amanda Staveley for failing to condemn these issues Alan Shearer believes instead that the takeover of Newcastle by the Saudi fund is “a special day” filled not with pain, guilt and chicanery, but with hope. It might be funny. If only it wasn’t so depressing, and so difficult. This is not an unprovoked, ad hominem attack on Alan Shearer. It is a considered, ad principium attack on the world view he is espousing. I like and admire Alan Shearer, both as a great ex-footballer – among the best in the world in his pomp – and as a pundit too, a role he has grown into from the early awkwardness as a rather taciturn ex-pro, to his current incarnation as an honest, forensic and informative dispenser of truths. Except, not so much here. That state of cognitive dissonance is just too weird to gloss over. Shall we set it out here, just to be clear? Roman Abramovich has been sanctioned by the British government because he is “associated with a person who is or has been involved in destabilising Ukraine and undermining and threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine.” What happens if we take these words and transpose them? Because Newcastle’s ownership is not just “associated with” or distantly tied to the destabilising, undermining and Biblical-scale destruction of it own neighbour Yemen. It is openly and personally engaged in it. This not a link that needs to be proven or teased out. It is literally the same person overseeing both the football fund and the fighter jets. And given it is now OK, and indeed de rigueur to suggest Chelsea’s trophies are stained by the blood of the citizens of Kyiv and Mariupol, it has been an odd thing to scan the sports websites and slip between these two extremes. Over here we have the guilt and the shame of Chelsea. And then just below the news from Newcastle about what an excellent job Eddie Howe is doing (which he really is) and what a smart, entirely commendable bit of spending that £80m winter window investment is turning out to be. This is not whataboutery. It is literally the same thing. Football owner + bloody war = undesirable. This is genuine equivalence. An estimated 10,000 children have been killed or maimed in Yemen. Shouldn’t someone in football also care about it just a little? Alan? Are there, like, any more videos? There are two things worth saying about this. First, it is just so hard, and so complex. It’s not the fault of the club’s supporters, who are being asked to process and take a view on something that has so many angles, and who only really come to this place for a little light and joy, to savour that connection. This thing has been foisted on all of us. How do we solve it? Perhaps some basic clarity would help. This is the second thing here. The truth is quite simple. We don’t talk about sanctioning Saudi, or have images of the war in Yemen placed in front of us on a daily basis for one very obvious reason. Saudi is an ally. Whereas Russia is hostile. Check back and Abramovich was also hit with sanctions because the government suspects he has been “supplying steel to the Russian military which may have been used in the production of tanks”. Let’s take that across too. Newcastle’s fund is owned by an entity that is literally, not potentially, sending tanks to kill civilians. But in this case those arms are supplied by Britain. To date the UK has supplied the Saudi coalition with £10bn of Typhoon and Tornado aircraft, Paveway bombs, Brimstone and Storm Shadow missiles. Zoom out and it isn’t hard to picture a world where Putin is calling for sanctions against Britain and ordering Abramovich to offload Chelsea to preserve the good name of the Kremlin. This is the world in which sport finds itself embedded. What has changed is the hard edges of where this thing can lead are now very visible. If Shearer’s paradox teaches us anything it is that you either see it and reject it en bloc; or it is probably best to keep quiet.",Sport/Football,Shouldn’t someone in football also care about the war in Yemen just a little? | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/11/shouldnt-someone-in-football-also-care-about-the-war-in-yemen-just-a-little
3/12/2022,"Uber fares across the UK are to rise sharply from Monday night when VAT of 20% will be applied to rides booked via the app. The change comes after a high court ruling last December that Uber could not be viewed as simply an agent but should be regarded as the contractor. Uber said fares would have to rise. The additional VAT will be charged within the fare and not displayed to the passenger. It is understood that Uber may effectively subsidise some fares, as a spokesperson said fare rises would vary from city to city, but refused to divulge further details on pricing on the grounds it was competitively sensitive. App users have been notified on a change in the terms and conditions which will mean passengers contract directly with Uber, rather than the driver, from 11.59pm on Monday. While the original ruling only applied to Uber’s business model in London, its biggest market, a spokesman said it was applying the changes nationwide in anticipation of further legal changes. Other operators will be legally required to follow suit in London, although they have yet to confirm plans. An Uber spokesperson said: “We have completed the changes to our business model as required by law. Other operators in London are also required to make changes to their models to comply with the relevant law. “Uber operates in an intensely competitive market and we are committed to always offering consumers affordable prices. As always, riders will get a trip price before booking their journey.” The changes came after judges initially queried Uber’s status during a court case where the multinational company was fighting a judgment that drivers were workers with rights. The rise in fares comes after Uber hiked prices in the capital by 10% last November to attract more drivers. It will also hit Londoners’ pockets weeks after a nearly 5% fare rise on public transport in the city.",News/Technology,Uber fares to rise in UK as 20% VAT rate is applied ,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/11/uber-fares-to-rise-by-20-across-uk-as-vat-is-applied
3/12/2022,"The owner of a US company that has sold ammunition online to numerous mass shooters has prompted outcry as he pursues a permanent position on Tennessee’s education board. Jordan Mollenhour, who was backed by the state’s Republican governor, was confirmed by the state’s Republican-led senate on Thursday morning by 26-6. He is the owner of Lucky Gunners, an online Knoxville-based ammunition company that he co-founded in 2009. Mollenhour has been serving as a member of the state’s board of education for district two since November, but needs approval from the state house and senate to make his appointment permanent. The House will vote on Mollenhour’s nomination on Monday. State school boards generally represent the public’s views on education, setting policies and goals as well as overseeing resources. His online profile states Mollenhour is “committed to serving Tennessee’s students, parents, teachers, and other stakeholders in an effort to improve the lives of all Tennesseans of all ages”. Mollenhour’s company has faced numerous lawsuits, including a currently active one that accuses it of negligently selling ammunition to a then 17-year-old who killed 10 people and injured 13 others at his high school in Santa Fe, Texas, in 2018. The victims argue that Lucky Gunner did not require the shooter to show any ID or submit proof of his age before he purchased over 100 rounds of ammunition from the website. “The shooter was apparently so confident Lucky Gunner wouldn’t check his age that he felt comfortable using his own name and address to illegally purchase the ammunition … in less than two minutes, Lucky Gunner approved his order, which was mailed to the shooter’s home two days later,” the plaintiffs allege. Mollenhour’s company denied any wrongdoing and argued that its owners were immune from the lawsuit under the federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which forbids firearms and ammunition manufacturers and dealers from being held responsible when their products are used in criminal acts. In March 2021, a judge denied Lucky Gunner’s request to dismiss the case and ordered the lawsuit to proceed. Lucky Gunner was also sued in 2014 for selling 4,000 rounds of ammunition to the shooter who killed 12 people and injured 70 others in a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado in 2012. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in 2015. Mollenhour’s proposed appointment to the education board has been met with fierce criticism from the state’s Democrats and the public. Jeff Yarbro, a Tennessee Democratic senator tweeted, “There are nearly 7 million people in Tennessee. Surely to God, @GovBillLee could have found one state board of education nominee who’s not in ongoing litigation about illegally selling ammunition used in a deadly school shooting.” Beth Joslin Roth, executive director at Safe Tennessee Project, a grassroots gun-control organization, said, “The man who sold ammo to the underage shooter who carried out the sixth deadliest shooting in US history is likely to be appointed to our state’s school board. This is so messed up. It’s disgusting.” Mollenhour pushed back against criticism, telling The Tennessean that gun-control groups are using his nomination to “attack the second amendment once again”. “I reached out to a number of today’s critics many weeks ago and offered to answer any questions,” he said, adding, “I didn’t get a single question which only confirms that their antics today have nothing to do with facts. It was political theatre.”",News/US news,Ammunition company owner’s run for state education board sparks outcry,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/11/ammunition-company-owner-jordan-mollenhour-education-board-tennessee
3/12/2022,"The senior Tory minister Penny Mordaunt has suggested her colleagues should stop taking funds from Alexander Temerko, a major party donor who described her as an “absolutely uncontrollable woman” and “threat to national security”. Mordaunt, a trade minister, said she had no issue with colleagues who have historically accepted money from Temerko but said everyone should be aware now how he has treated her. The row between Temerko and Mordaunt arose after the government blocked an application by his company, Aquind, to build a subsea electricity cable between France and the UK. Mordaunt, whose Portsmouth constituency would have been affected, campaigned against the £1.2bn project. Temerko last donated to the party last year but he has recently socialised with Conservatives, including having dinner with the former cabinet minister Jeremy Hunt this week, and meeting a cabinet minister in the House of Lords. Temerko is also a friend of Boris Johnson and is known to refer to him as Sasha, after Johnson’s real first name, Alexander. In a statement, Mordaunt said the party’s code of conduct “should apply to all members including donors”. She added: “Donating to a political party is a social good. It enables democracy and good things to happen in our communities. I know that the donor community feel doubly let down when someone does not abide by the behaviour we expect. “As an MP I am shocked that a party donor has threatened me just for doing my job and representing my constituents. His comments speak for themselves. Donors don’t control MPs. Donors don’t get to decide what MPs do or think.” “In the context of what is happening in Ukraine I want to make it clear my concerns about Mr Temerko have nothing to do with his heritage or former employment,” she added. “It has everything to do with his behaviour towards me and my constituents. “Nor do I have an issue with colleagues or associations who have historically accepted donations from him in good faith. They will have had no knowledge of these issues. But everyone does now.” She added: “Members of parliament should not be threatened. Our democracy should not be undermined. Bullies should not be tolerated.” Hunt told Business Insider, which first reported the row: “Alexander Temerko is a Ukrainian-born British businessman who has spent his life standing up to Putin and as such encountered considerable personal danger. It was a privilege to meet him yesterday to express my condolences over the family members he has just lost back home as a result of Putin’s evil war.” Temerko’s spokesperson has been approached for comment. Temerko made the comments about Mordaunt in January, when Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, ruled against the project, saying its “adverse effects weigh against the proposed development”. Together, Aquind and its co-owner Temerko have donated £1.1m to the Tory party, including contributions to 21 Tory MPs and ministers. In October, the Guardian and BBC reported that documents in the Pandora papers suggested Aquind’s majority owner, Viktor Fedotov, secretly co-owned a company once accused of participating in a massive embezzlement scheme in Russia. Lawyers for Fedotov and Aquind strongly denied all accusations of wrongdoing. The company has said it has operated in an open and transparent manner, saying its donations were “entirely lawful, properly declared and have not been made in return for any special treatment”.

3/12/2022,"My friend Joy Mitchell, who has died aged 88, was a committed Christian and socialist, and a lifelong campaigner for peace and against nuclear arms. Born in Lanchester, County Durham, she was the middle child of William Peacock, a coke drawer at Whinfield coke ovens, and his wife, Jane (nee Coulthard), who had been a teacher before she married. After attending grammar school, in the early 1950s Joy trained as a teacher at Bingley Teacher Training College and went to work at a primary school near Rowlands Gill in County Durham. From an early age she was a Christian activist and a member of Donald Soper’s radical Methodist Order of Christian Witness, giving speeches in public on the need for social reforms, pacifism, and non-violence as a way of life. She was also a lay preacher. In 1962 she married George Mitchell, a minister at the Presbyterian Church of England at Pelaw on Tyneside. They soon moved to to St Andrew’s church in Blackheath, south London, and and in 1973 to the Glasgow area, where George became minister of the West Parish Church of Scotland in Airdrie in 1976. Joy worked full-time as a minister’s wife, with all that that entailed. In the early 1980s she returned to full-time teaching at Willowbank School in Airdrie, and soon became its headteacher. In 1988 the couple bought a disused church, St Aidan’s, in Berwick-upon-Tweed, intending to create their own peace church, and Joy retired from teaching. When George died suddenly in 1989, at the age of 61, Joy decided to continue their joint work and the restoration of the church. There she held regular services, speaker meetings and coffee mornings, open to all, and gave shelter to homeless people. Friday meetings evolved into a socialist discussion and reading group covering topics from poetry to Islam, philosophy and the history of thought. Each month she convened a peace vigil. Meanwhile Joy attended anti-nuclear and anti-war demonstrations all over the country and was regularly arrested at protests. She was especially concerned with the transportation of nuclear warheads up the A1. More than 10 times she was arrested and fined, and once spent a week in Cornton Vale prison, Stirling, for blocking the naval base at Faslane. Expressing herself forcefully, fearlessly and controversially, she was fuelled by her determination and commitment to say what she saw was right. Joy continued to run the monthly peace vigil and the reading group, and to be an active member of the Berwick Trades Council. Until the last five years of her life she went to peace protests. At home in Ravensdowne, she enjoyed her wild flower garden, and her work at St Aidan’s continues under the stewardship of the St Aidan’s Arts Centre.

3/12/2022,"The Queen will not attend the annual Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey on Monday, Buckingham Palace has confirmed. The 95-year-old monarch, who is the head of the Commonwealth, had hoped to join the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at the event, after recently recovering from Covid-19. A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: “After discussing the arrangements with the royal household, the Queen has asked the Prince of Wales to represent Her Majesty at the Commonwealth service at Westminster Abbey on Monday. “The Queen will continue with other planned engagements, including in-person audiences, in the week ahead.” It is thought the decision was not due to any illness, but to discussions about the comfort of getting the Queen to and from the service. She will instead send a video message to the congregation. The celebration is a favourite of the monarch, with music, poetry and speeches performed in an ode to the “family of nations”. Guests will also include Boris Johnson, Commonwealth secretary-general Lady Scotland, high commissioners, ambassadors, senior politicians and dignitaries from across the UK and Commonwealth, faith leaders and more than 600 schoolchildren and young people. The palace confirmed that the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester would not be attending the service, as the Duke had tested positive for coronavirus. The news comes days after it was announced that the Queen will be moving out of Buckingham Palace and into her residence in Windsor Castle for the foreseeable future. She had been undertaking “light duties”, the palace said, since a bout of ill-health, though was not currently ill. However, she is known to have suffered from mobility issues. The monarch regularly uses a walking stick and recently spoke about her physical health, telling two senior military officers who asked how she was during a Windsor Castle reception: “Well, as you can see, I can’t move.” Instead, she is thought to be pacing herself before her 96th birthday celebrations in six weeks. The Queen last cancelled an appearance at the Commonwealth Day service nine years ago in 2013, when she was recovering from a bout of gastroenteritis. Before that, she hadn’t missed a single service for 20 years, the last occasion being when she caught flu in 1993. The Queen returned to in-person events on Monday, when she welcomed Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, to Windsor Castle. She was pictured sharing a joke with the politician at the start of their meeting – and was using a walking stick. Prior to her Covid infection, her last public in-person meeting was on 5 February, when she hosted a reception at her home in Sandringham to celebrate her platinum jubilee. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Prince Harry has confirmed he will not return to the UK for Prince Philip’s memorial service on 29 March. However, the Duke of Sussex did hope to visit his grandmother the Queen soon, the spokesperson said. In February, the Duke launched legal action against the Home Office for denying his family access to police protection when they visit the country. He was last in Britain in the summer of 2021, to unveil a statue of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, at Kensington Palace. On the same trip his security was compromised when his car was chased by paparazzi photographers as he left a charity event. A legal representative of the Duke said that he feels his family are “unable to return home because it is too dangerous”.",News/UK news,"Queen not attending Commonwealth Day service, says palace",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/11/queen-not-attending-commonwealth-day-service-says-palace
3/12/2022,"The UK government views the British property tycoon Nick Candy and a consortium headed by Todd Boehly and Hansjörg Wyss as serious contenders to buy Chelsea after inviting potential bidders to approach it with takeover proposals. Chelsea are in an unprecedented state of limbo after sanctions were imposed on Roman Abramovich, with the Russian oligarch barred from selling the club for the time being, but the feeling in Westminster is that the government believes the process of finding a new owner will not be derailed by this week’s dramatic developments. The decision to freeze Abramovich’s assets because of his ties to Vladimir Putin and the Russian government has left Chelsea at risk of major financial problems, but it has not deterred parties interested in buying the club. Boehly and Wyss are waiting for a response to their opening offer, which was between £2bn and £2.5bn, and Candy is working on a proposal. There is also strong interest from Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets, and the Ricketts family, who own the Chicago Cubs. Neither Johnson nor the Ricketts family has responded to questions about their plans. The situation is urgent from Chelsea’s perspective. They have been granted a special licence to continue football-related activities but they are operating under heavy restrictions. Abramovich is unable to put money into Chelsea and fears are growing that the European champions could fall into administration if a sale is not agreed soon because they are not permitted to collect matchday income, merchandise sales have been banned and the shirt sponsor Three has suspended its partnership. However, the government is keen to target Abramovich rather than Chelsea, which it views as a “significant cultural asset”, and it will consider an application for a new licence that would permit a sale. Chris Philp, the digital and technology minister, said on Friday that Abramovich would be prevented from selling the club but potential buyers could approach the government with takeover proposals as long as the Russian would not benefit from the deal. The viability of potential buyers is being discussed in political circles. Boehly and Wyss remain confident that their consortium, which includes an unnamed businessman, will be viewed favourably by the government and Premier League. It is understood that Candy, a Tory donor, is also seen as a strong contender to buy Chelsea. The property developer is working on finding investors and his proposals include plans for an expensive redevelopment of Stamford Bridge, which could work in his favour. Candy, a Chelsea fan, is worth a reported £1.5bn. “We are examining the details of yesterday’s announcement and we are still interested in making a bid,” Candy’s spokesperson said. “Clearly, this is a time of great uncertainty for all Chelsea fans. In our view, no one is the owner of a football club – you are the custodian of it for the fans and the community.” The sale process is being overseen by the New York-based bank The Raine Group. Other interested parties include the Turkish businessman Muhsin Bayrak, Jamie Reuben and the Crystal Palace shareholder Josh Harris. However, there is a feeling that even if Reuben wanted to step away from Newcastle United, it would be difficult because the Reuben Brothers property business founded by his father and uncle not only holds a 10% stake in the club but is heavily involved in implementing Saudi-funded plans to launch hundreds of thousands pounds worth of regeneration projects on Tyneside. The UK government and Premier League are understood to be extremely keen to see the proposed redevelopments start taking shape, and previously closed doors may be now opened for Reuben Brothers to explore business opportunities in Saudi Arabia and the wider Gulf region. Moreover Jamie Reuben is said to be enjoying his directorship at St James’ Park and was at Southampton on Thursday night, cheering Eddie Howe’s team on alongside his co-director Amanda Staveley. Chelsea, who host Newcastle in the Premier League on Sunday, remain in discussions with the government about softening some of the restrictions it faces – including a £20,000 limit on costs for away matches. The club say even Thursday’s relatively short midweek trip to Norwich cost more than that. The limit does not apply to Wednesday’s Champions League game at Lille because it had already been booked. The licence permits Chelsea to continue paying employees but does not allow Abramovich to profit from the club’s income. Chelsea argue there is a risk they may not be able to finish the season unless the terms are changed. They say ticket revenue is needed to remain operational and that they will not be able to continue covering the cost of stewarding, catering and security unless they close areas of Stamford Bridge. Whereas the licence restricts the club to paying £500,000 towards each home game, Chelsea have told the government £800,000-£1m is needed to stage a Premier League match. No programmes will be on general sale on Sunday and people employed on a freelance and contract basis are no longer being paid. Although Chelsea’s bank accounts continue to operate, the company credit cards have been suspended, bringing complications. A No 10 spokesperson said: “We’re in constant contact with the club and the Premier League over any issues that have been raised through the sanctions and the licence that the Treasury has issued them. In terms of process, it’s now up to the club to apply for any amended licence. I believe Chelsea have said that they will do that, and we’ll obviously work with the club to consider any operationally necessary changes. But as we said yesterday, the measures we put in place are to ensure that any revenue generated can’t find its way back to the Putin regime.” Chelsea fans have faced criticism for chanting Abramovich’s name during their side’s win at Norwich on Thursday. The government spokesperson added: “We understand the strength of feeling that Chelsea fans will have, and their passion for the club. But it’s important to remember that these sanctions are being imposed on those who have provided support to the Putin regime and the brutal assault on Ukraine.”",Sport/Football,Nick Candy and Boehly-Wyss seen as serious Chelsea buyers by government,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/11/nick-candy-todd-boehly-hansjorg-wyss-serious-chelsea-buyers-government-roman-abramovich
3/12/2022,"Seventy four people have been charged over Insulate Britain road blockade protests in Kent, the county’s police force has said, in what is believed to be the first criminal proceedings against the activist group. The force said a total of 104 charges had been laid against Insulate Britain members in relation to protests that took place on the M25 and on roads near the port of Dover in September and October last year. All 74 defendants have been summonsed to appear at Crawley magistrates court from April. There were 73 charges of public nuisance, 29 charges of obstruction and two charges of criminal damage to a police car, Kent police said in a statement on Friday. Insulate Britain activists had previously only faced civil action over their protests, with at least 15 jailed after a high court hearings for breaching injunctions obtained by National Highways banning them from blocking parts of the road network. Insulate Britain said members had also been charged after investigations by the Metropolitan police and Hertfordshire constabulary, but the Guardian was unable to confirm details of the charges at the time of writing. The carried out a campaign of disruptive protests between September and October, blocking roads at rush hour, gluing themselves and causing traffic chaos in an effort to pressure the government into a national programme to insulate every home in the country by 2030. Activists said such a programme would be both a concrete first step in tackling the climate crisis and a measure to combat fuel poverty. But their methods proved divisive. Although the group had many supporters, many motorists accused them of targeting the wrong people and even fellow environmental activists warned its campaign could be counterproductive and chose to distance themselves from the group. At one stage police were deployed at every junction of the M25 in an attempt to stop the group, while ministers railed against “ecowarriors” who were “destroying people’s lives” and Boris Johnson called for powers to “insulate them snugly in prison”. The group had said it would continue its campaign until its demands were met or its members jailed, but last month it announced it would instead throw its weight behind a new campaign, Just Stop Oil, targeting Britain’s oil infrastructure. A spokesperson for the group said: “Insulate Britain supporters have received charges from the Met, Herts and Kent police. They along with the CPS [Crown Prosecution Service], will be seen by history as betraying this country, for criminalising those who wanted to protect all people living here in the UK and to start the process of decarbonisation to protect the nations of the global south. “The cost of living catastrophe is causing misery for millions of people in this country. Our proposal is a massive part of the solution. “Insulating Britain is also a huge part of the process of giving the UK energy security, which is obviously an important subject as we see war raging in Europe funded by fossil fuels. Oil and gas funds war and causes insecurity globally. The government must halt all future fossil fuel licences immediately to give humanity a chance of survival. In order to stop fossil fuels we need to Insulate Britain.” ",News/UK news,Kent police charge 74 people over Insulate Britain road protests,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/11/kent-police-charge-74-people-insulate-britain-road-protests-block-m25-dover
3/12/2022,"Commuters across New South Wales and Queensland are dodging gaping potholes and avoiding cracked roads after flooding damaged the states’ road networks, with mayors arguing they will need to be repaired stronger to withstand future disasters. Many NSW and Queensland councils are scrambling to find funding that could top $1bn in total to repair roads ripped apart by the devastating flood waters. As storms eased and waters receded in NSW this week, the full extent of the damage was revealed, with landslides and cracks on freeways, roads and suburban streets. Councils are responsible for 90% of the NSW road network including road safety and maintenance. Queensland councils are stewards of about 80% of that state’s roads and bridges. The Local Government NSW president, Darriea Turley, said it was “hard to determine” the full cost of repairs that councils faced because damage continued to be tracked. “Road maintenance is already one of the biggest expenses in council budgets without the damage that is expected from the flooding crisis,” Turley said. “Before the flooding crisis, the road maintenance backlog was around $1.7bn … there will be huge financial challenges ahead for councils to rebuild their communities. “It is crucial that councils receive sufficient funding and support from government to fund roads. Roads across NSW cannot just simply be rebuilt, but rather, they need to be rebuilt to withstand future disasters.” The Queensland Reconstruction Authority said 22 local government areas from Gladstone in the north, to the Gold Coast in the south and Goondiwindi in the west would receive assistance under the joint commonwealth-state Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements (DRFA) to restore damaged essential public infrastructures such as roads and bridges. “Given the size and scale of the event, the Queensland government is looking at a range of resilience and mitigation measures for an extraordinary assistance package under the DRFA, which would likely include a betterment package to help build public infrastructure damaged by these floods to a better standard,” the authority said on Friday. On Sydney’s northern beaches, where flood waters shut off the three major routes in and out of the CBD, a “massive cleanup effort” was under way as council crews began to assess and repair damaged infrastructure. A Northern Beaches council spokesperson said there had been hundreds of requests for assistance since flood waters hit on Tuesday, particularly around Manly, Balgowlah, Dee Why and Narrabeen. More than 20 landslips had been reported. “There are significant potholes, trees and landslips impacting the road network,” the spokesperson said. “The priority has been to reopen roads as soon as possible and while most are now open some will take longer to make safe.” The Northern Beaches mayor, Michael Regan, said it was too early to tell how high the repair cost would be but the council welcomed funding from state and federal governments to assist with the cleanup. “Across our entire region we have seen extensive damage and while we are thankful to have the rain ease, the cleanup and recovery process we are faced with is significant,” he said. The Blue Mountains mayor, Mark Greenhill, said the cost of repairing and future-proofing roads in his shire was expected to be in the vicinity of $50m with landslip repairs in excess of $30m. “The bill for fixing embankments and other assets is likely to reach $39m,” he said. “We could be looking at a figure greater than $100m to repair and future-proof the city … [the] government needs to help.” On the NSW south coast, gaping potholes were littered across the Princes Highway, winding from Shellharbour to south of Batemans Bay.

A full assessment of the extent of the damage was still taking place, with repairs expected to take days in some hard-hit areas that remained cut off. The Shoalhaven mayor, Amanda Findley, said road conditions were expected to further deteriorate with more rain forecast. “We are doing our best to keep up with the need for essential roadworks,” she said. “We are asking motorists to be patient while the extent of damage is being assessed.” The Murwillumbah district chamber of commerce president, Rebecca Whan, said she was “shocked” by how long it had taken for assistance to arrive when the extreme weather hit. In the first 48 hours of the floods, she said Tweed – despite being 20km from the Gold Coast – was a ghost town, with no road access or phone reception. “We have big landslips all over the shire and enormous damage – some areas are still inaccessible,” she said. “The 2017 flood road damage cost was $27m here in Tweed alone, and this will be much higher this time.” A Tweed council spokesperson said there were four major landslips in the shire that were expected to close roads for “many months” while repairs were undertaken. “The repair list is likely to exceed the 1,600 jobs required after the 2017 flood,” the spokesperson said. The Byron mayor, Michael Lyon, said his shire was facing a damages bill to repair roads and bridges in excess of $100m. “Many of our community have lost everything,” he said. “The initial package isn’t enough … we are facing some major infrastructure issues.” More than 45 NSW councils hardest hit had received an initial $1m under the Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements. Emergency works needed to be done to repair roads are paid for out of the DRFA fund. But less severe damage, such as potholes, are funded by councils. The state Greens MP David Shoebridge said it was “hard to understand” why Lismore city council had received a blanket $1m payment despite being the epicentre of the flood crisis. It had been estimated infrastructure damage would cost upwards of $400m to repair in the devastated region. “Lismore city council has been smashed by flood. Machinery lost, buildings destroyed, roads ruined,” Shoebridge said. “So far it’s got the same payment from the state government as Bayside council in Sydney.” Turley said she expected the initial payment would be followed by further funding. “It is still uncertain how long it will take for councils to rebuild their communities,” she said. “Right now, our mayors, councillors and council staff are out on the frontlines fighting to save homes and businesses in their communities, including their own. It’s really, really tough out there, and when the water subsides the hard work of cleanup and recovery begins.” Fifteen local government areas in south-east Queensland are also dealing with the impact of catastrophic flooding. “Full assessment of the damage is yet to be completed,” the Local Government Association of Queensland said on Friday. “Councils like North Burnett have over 3,000km of unsealed roads and there is significant damage to many of those.” Queensland’s Department of Transport and Main Roads said: “Damage assessments will continue over coming months and a significant program of reconstruction works will be required. A budget for road repairs will be allocated once the full extent of damage is known.”",News/Australia news,"Roads ripped apart by NSW and Queensland floods must be rebuilt stronger, councils say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/12/roads-ripped-apart-by-nsw-and-queensland-floods-must-be-rebuilt-stronger-councils-say
3/12/2022,"Outside this anteroom at the University of Queensland is a stock standard laboratory where, like most labs around the world, plastic is ubiquitous. The bench tops are laminated, there are plastic tubs and bottles everywhere and staff walk around in lab coats made from synthetic fibres. There is plastic in the air, on the floor and scientists drink out of it. But in here, through a tightly sealed door, there is virtually none of the stuff. Through another door, in an air-locked corridor, scientists walk in, plastic-free, ready to enter a laboratory space that is unlike any other in the world. Here, the insulating wall panels are made from aluminium. The floor, ceiling and walls are made from steel that is welded to avoid the use of silicone or plastic joins. The air-filters are made from paper. “Affectionately, it’s called the submarine,” says Prof Kevin Thomas, the director of UQ’s Queensland Alliance for Environmental Health Sciences. Inside this metal box – just 12 sq metres in size and funded by the foundation of the mining billionaire, Andrew Forrest – scientists hope to answer one of the world’s most pressing environmental questions: is plastic, and the multitude of chemicals that go with it, getting into the tissues in our bodies? And if it is, are humans being harmed? “A normal lab is full of plastics and the chemicals used to make them. They’re abundant,” says Thomas. “But I don’t know if we can say that they’re dangerous yet. But I want to know.” One fundamental problem that scientists studying exposure to plastics face is that even in a laboratory, there is a risk their samples are being contaminated during their experiments. If they find nano-sized plastics and chemicals in a tissue sample, they can’t be confident how it got there. Was the sample exposed during the everyday life of a human, or did the plastic get there during the testing? This lab, says Thomas, aims to almost completely eliminate plastic so that samples can be extracted inside a special steel cabinet, then sealed in glass and moved outside to a piece of kit called a mass spectrometer. “If you put two spoonfuls of sugar in eight olympic swimming pools, this could detect it,” says Thomas, pointing to a mass spectrometer with a sticker on it. “My Name Is NEGU,” the sticker reads. NEGU stands for “Never, Ever Give Up,” a catchphrase of Forrest, its benefactor. Two weeks ago, Forrest also stood in the contamination-controlled lab to inspect the space. His Minderoo Foundation has pumped $3.2m into the equipment, and added another $1.3m to support the scientists that will do the work. Scientists in the lab – part of Minderoo’s Plastics and Human Health centre at UQ – have already started working with blood, urine and brain tissues, fine-tuning their methodology ready for the start of the first tests, likely to be on human urine. Thomas says they are working at sizes below 10 microns (one micron is one-1,000th of a millimetre). “That’s the size range that is feasible to cross biological barriers,” he says. Humans and other living things around the world are exposed to plastic all the time. It is in the water that we drink, the food that we eat and the air that we breathe. It’s likely, Thomas says, that it is in our lungs and stomach even as we do this interview. But is it being absorbed in our body? About four years ago, Thomas started an experiment on human blood, but the amount of plastic in the sample of blood was the same as a blank sample. “We didn’t know if it was coming from the blood or the lab, so we parked that work,” he says. During a workshop last year with the Minderoo Foundation, Thomas says there was much disagreement. Some scientists rejected any suggestion that plastic or the associated chemicals could make their way into human tissues. Some – like Thomas – admitted they didn’t know, while at least one was utterly convinced the chemicals and plastics were already in our tissues. The UQ and Minderoo team started to design the lab two years ago, sourcing as many plastic-alternative materials as possible. A “PVC-free” floor covering turned out not to be PVC-free. But Thomas says tests in the lab’s environment have so far found no evidence of plastics or their associated chemicals – such as phthalates and bisphenols – below 500 nanometres (one sheet of paper is about 100,000 nanometres thick). Prof Sarah Dunlop, who leads the plastics and human health work at the Minderoo Foundation, says: “There is so much public attention on microplastics but I think that is because we can see them. Our exposure to them is staggering. “For nanoplastics – the reason we don’t know much about them is because it is so hard to measure. But is it linked to health impacts? We know they’re out there and we know about the risk. “But this is about establishing whether or not there’s harm and then using that to drive change.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning While the “submarine” is cutting the chances of experiments being compromised, the team are also working with other scientists that are collecting samples, including the Sydney Brain Bank, to develop protocols to reduce the chances of plastic contamination during collection. The task is mammoth, but Dunlop says getting an answer to the question of whether plastic is harming humans is like a scientific “holy grail”. “People see plastic as a waste problem but not about the pollution inside our bodies – inside our children’s bodies – or how it might change how our brains develop. But that is what it is to be human.”",News/Environment,Plastic-free ‘submarine’ helps Queensland scientists find if nanoplastics are inside us,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/12/plastic-free-submarine-helps-queensland-scientists-find-if-nanoplastics-are-inside-us
3/12/2022,"A neurologist who resigned from a global sports concussion organisation amid allegations of plagiarism in a medical journal editorial has been accused of copying material in other articles without attribution. Dr Paul McCrory, who in 2016 described concussion among NFL players as “overblown” and has advised the AFL on the issue, stood down as chair of Concussion in Sport Group (CISG) this week after the British Journal of Sports Medicine retracted the 2005 editorial, citing an “unlawful and indefensible breach of copyright” of the work of Prof Steve Haake. The CISG receives funding from peak sporting bodies, including the International Olympic Committee and FIFA. McCrory was editor of the British Journal of Sports Medicine at the time his editorial was published. He was quoted on the website Retraction Watch on 4 March as saying he had requested the paper be retracted after realising an unfinished and unreferenced draft had been accidentally uploaded. “Not the final version, and as the draft was incomplete it failed to appropriately cite the original and excellent work of Professor Haake,” McCrory reportedly told Retraction Watch. “This was entirely my error which I did not pick up on at the time and I apologise. “I am in the process of removing any reference to the article on the various online manuscript databases. I am also rechecking the whole series of warmup articles that were uploaded at that time to see whether I have made the same error in other articles in the upload process.” McCrory, an honorary associate with the prestigious Florey Institute for medical research in Melbourne, has reportedly requested a second article be retracted from the same journal. He was quoted on Retraction Watch admitting a similar error had occurred. He said: “The errors were not deliberate or intentional but nevertheless require redress as what has been published is plagiarism. Once again I apologise for my error.” It is alleged about half of the article was copied from an article Haake wrote in 2000 for Physics Today. McCrory has also reportedly sought advice from the journal as to whether a third article should be retracted. He was quoted on Retraction Watch stating: “This [article] has the correct citations including the source material of the authors and the news article where the text came from, however the typesetting had not included the quotation marks in the text and not inserted the references in the text correctly.” He has not responded to requests from Guardian Australia for comment. Data analyst Nick Brown, who is affiliated with Linnaeus University in Sweden and reviews scientific papers for errors, told Guardian Australia that based on analysis he had done he believed it was not the first time McCrory may have plagiarised work. Brown has examined 10 more of McCrory’s published pieces published from 2002 onwards that appear to contain significant amounts of plagiarised work without attribution. These include articles by McCrory on concussion. McCrory did not respond to questions from Guardian Australia about Brown’s analysis. McCrory currently advises the AFL on its concussion policies. The AFL did not respond to Guardian Australia’s request for comment as to whether the plagiarism allegations concerned them or were leading to a review of their affiliation with him. McCrory has previously claimed the issue of concussion within the NRL was “overblown”. While he was with CISG, the organisation developed the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool, which is used to assess athletes with head injuries. Head injuries are of increasing concern in sport, with groundbreaking research into the long-term ramifications of concussion by the Australian Sports Brain Bank in February finding chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in the brains of more than half of a cohort of donors, including three under the age of 35. McCrory is lead author of the 2nd to 5th international consensus statements on concussion in sport. In a lecture he delivered in 2016 to the Florey Institute on “Media, Myths and Medicine”, McCrory said “all the carry-on and hoo-ha you get from the United States” about the dangers of concussion were not nearly as serious as some reports had led the public to believe. He said the media was guilty of “over-simplifying” a complex topic. Dr Chris Nowinski is chief executive and founder of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, which supports athletes affected by concussions and traumatic brain injuries. In an article published on the foundation’s website, Nowinski argues that McCrory misinterpreted and accordingly misrepresented Boston University brain injury research during his 2016 Florey Institute lecture. During the lecture McCrory said Boston University researchers found about 4% of retired athletes get CTE. “The other way of looking at it is that 96% of athletes do not get it,” McCrory said. “Yet if you read the media, particularly from the United States, you get a very different perspective.” But Nowinski argues that misrepresents what the Boston University research found. The research examined prevalence of CTE in deceased professional American football players who died between February 2008 and June 2010, and of 321 known player deaths the brains of 12 underwent postmortem examination. All 12 showed evidence of CTE, suggesting an estimated lifetime prevalence of at least 3.7%, the study found. But the authors of the study also wrote this was a conservative estimate because only a small sample of deceased players brains had been studied. Given all of those that were examined had evidence of CTE, it suggests CTE is a serious public health issue, the authors wrote. Nowinski believes McCrory also misinterpreted the Boston University research in a 2013 publication where he wrote that if the 12 brains studied represented all CTE cases ever in the NFL, “the incidence rate would be less than 0.01%”. McCrory did not respond to questions about Nowinski’s assertions. Nowinski told Guardian Australia: “McCrory is the lead author of one of the most influential consensus guidelines through which global concussion and CTE prevention and policy efforts are built upon, and it is critical that those guidelines reflect the best science. “When any researcher has multiple articles retracted over a week, it raises concerns about all of their publications. I look forward to learning how Florey and other institutions he has worked with plan to address the revelations. “To quote Paul McCrory on plagiarism, ‘the price of trust is eternal vigilance’, and ‘the higher up the greasy pole of academia one climbs, the greater the fall when things go pear shaped’.” A Florey Institute spokesperson said Florey “treats all matters concerning scientific integrity with the utmost seriousness and in compliance with applicable rules and regulations”. A spokesperson for the University of Melbourne, also affiliated with McCrory, said the university was “currently reviewing the circumstances and determining next steps”. “The University of Melbourne upholds the highest levels of research integrity and rigour,” the spokesperson said. Dr Deborah Apthorp, a cognitive neuroscientist, said the allegations of plagiarism were concerning and that scientists need to be accountable because they were often funded to carry out research to benefit the public.

3/12/2022,"Two weeks into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and China is still turning diplomatic cartwheels to prevent the war from damaging its global standing, while still preserving its strategic partnership with Moscow. China offers to mediate! China offers aid! China is “extremely concerned” about the safety of citizens! Xi mentions the word “war”! The plethora of headlines alone is evidence for how Beijing has been subtly shifting its language day-to-day to put some distance between itself and Moscow and its increasingly bloody military tactics. But for the moment, such protestations should be ignored. Beijing’s core message, especially the one tailored for its domestic audience and Moscow itself, is that it is standing by Russia, or perhaps more the point, against the US, which it continues to blame for the war. If there was ever any doubt as to Beijing’s authentic view, Zhao Lijian, the foreign ministry spokesperson and the most prominent voice of China’s “wolf warrior” diplomacy, provided it this week. Zhao attacked the US for secretly operating biological weapons labs in Ukraine. In doing so, he was echoing a conspiracy theory from Russia, for which there has been no evidence offered. Throughout, Beijing has not backed away from its core position, that Moscow has “legitimate security interests” in Ukraine. And like Moscow, state media in Beijing has labelled the US “an empire of lies”. Still, there is little doubt that Beijing is squirming under pressure, not just from the US, but also from Europe, Japan and Australia, to condemn the invasion. As Evan Feigenbaum, a former US government official and now head of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington thinktank, observed, Beijing is struggling to settle on a clear message for the simple reason that it is trying to reconcile the irreconcilable. Beijing simultaneously wants to preserve its partnership with Moscow, stand by its longstanding policy of territorial integrity and non-interference in other states, and avoid being collateral damage in the war. “The more China leans to Moscow, the more it paints a target on its back for Washington and Brussels on the sanctions,” Feigenbaum said in the SupChina podcast. “Obviously, facts on the ground in Ukraine flatly contradict anything the Chinese government would like to say about respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity.” Beijing doesn’t welcome the conflict and appears to have been taken aback by Vladimir Putin’s full throttle invasion, even though the Russian leader met with Xi Jinping days before the tanks headed across the border. Xi has been bedding down his own political system in readiness for the once-every-five-years Communist party congress at the end of the year, at which he is expected to seek a norm-busting third term. Xi neither needs nor wants any instability at such a sensitive moment. His many enemies have learned to shut their mouths in recent years lest they feel their leader’s wrath. But if the situation deteriorates in Ukraine and the conflict slides into a full-blown insurgency, Xi’s critics will have a stick to beat him with. After all, Xi and Putin have met nearly 40 times since 2012. For Xi not to have read the room and realised that Putin was readying a full invasion represents a failure on his part, and that of the Chinese system. Why then is Beijing standing by Moscow? It is important to remember that the “no limits” partnership signed in early February between the two leaders in Beijing was the culmination of a relationship two decades in the rebuilding. It is an unsentimental partnership but not a flash in the pan, and one which both countries have judged holds great value on multiple levels. Russia exports arms, energy and farm products, such as wheat, to China. China sends consumer goods in the other direction. Most importantly, both have an overriding interest in hobbling US power around the world, and in the European and Asian spheres in particular. Over time, Chinese support for Russia in Ukraine could be matched by Russian support for China in any crisis with Taiwan. They have already been running a parallel diplomatic strategy for years, according to which China allows Russia to take the lead in the Middle East, while Moscow buttresses Beijing in Asia. But the relationships has its pitfalls. Russia is by far the junior partner to a much larger China, the reverse of when the two countries were revolutionary comrades-in-arms in the 1950s. Beijing, for its own part, is finding itself hitched to a highly aggressive and unstable Russian leader, with little apparent ability to influence his actions. Beijing has also been courting Europe to split it from the US, with some success. Its position on Ukraine has instead sent this initiative into reverse, prompting renewed transatlantic bonding and demands from Brussels and other capitals that China withdraw support from Russia. If the conflict is still raging in six months, Beijing might not settle for a subtle re-positioning. Instead of taking fire for Moscow, it might start thinking of ways to put pressure on it as well.

3/12/2022,"Penny Wong won’t be fronting any of the election night television coverage this time around. Back in 2019, Labor’s Senate leader was on the ABC’s election night panel. As Labor lost the election it thought it would win, Wong had to sit, stoic, controlled, analysing the incoming shellacking for hours. Never again, she says. In a conversation for my podcast this weekend, Wong recalls one of her more terrible nights. She says she knew by 7.30pm Labor was not returning to government, because the scrutineers in Queensland were telegraphing a blow out. “I remember calculating how many hours I’d have to be on television before Bill [Shorten] conceded,” she says. The trauma remains deep etched, for Wong, and for Labor. Wong is on the podcast for a conversation about defence and foreign affairs, given Scott Morrison is fully intent on a khaki election. She raises election night in 2019 when I ask her how she is contemplating conducting foreign affairs differently, given oppositions always plan for a transition. Wong corrects my terminology. “We’re planning,” she says. After 2019, “I don’t contemplate. I plan for what we have to do without engaging in any assumption”. We are starting here this weekend because Wong’s summary neatly encapsulates Labor’s current mindset. Planning. Hoping, but after the 2019 rout, the opposition is too nervous to assume anything. But with the budget now in sight, and the campaign proper then under way shortly after, Labor is executing a gear change. A political party that thinks and moves as a collective, even during periods of maximum derangement, is entering the season of Anthony Albanese. Obviously Albanese has led his party for a full parliamentary term, steering colleagues past the trauma of the defeat, so when I say the season of Albanese, I mean Labor is about to learn whether or not the bloke up front can persuade voters he is the man for the moment. To this end, Albanese is assembling the components of his alternative prime minister story. There were two scene-setting speeches this week – one to a business summit arranged by the Australian Financial Review, and another to a foreign and defence policy related outing at the Lowy Institute. The spine of Albanese’s pitch to voters is “I represent safe change”. In that spirit, the Labor leader had two messages for the business community. The first was he planned to govern in the consensus style of Bob Hawke. The second was Labor had a growth and productivity agenda. Albanese would champion aspiration as well as fairness. At Lowy, Albanese wanted to project that he was a person who would bring a level of institutional seriousness back to the prime ministership. He told the foreign policy boffins he intended to “restore a greater sense of responsibility to the office of the prime minister”. Albanese also picked up some broken pieces from his near past. Asked by Lowy’s executive director, Michael Fullilove, to identify prime ministers he’d admired from a foreign policy perspective, Albanese eventually got to John Curtin (given Curtin, for Labor people, is always the correct answer). Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But first, he nominated Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard. Albanese said he’d seen Rudd “up close” during his first G20 meeting in London during the global financial crisis, shuttling between Barack Obama and the Chinese delegation. “I saw Australia punching above our weight,” he said. Albanese said Rudd had yanked Australia out of “the naughty corner” in global forums by ratifying the Kyoto protocol. Lest anyone be accused of having a favourite sibling, Albanese added: “The relationship Julia Gillard forged with president Obama was extraordinary. It led to Julia addressing Washington in a celebrated address, and a great honour for our country, and it led to the increased presence of US Marines in the Northern Territory.” These reflections felt sincere, but they were also very obviously didactic and rehabilitative. Albanese wanted to project a sense of competence from the recent past – a past in which he’d been a significant actor. Rudd/Gillard/Rudd wasn’t all civil war was his point. That government I was part of wasn’t all rank self-indulgence. We did things too. In addition to the speeches, Albanese has done the obligatory Women’s Weekly profile – a rite of passage for any prime ministerial aspirant. This Sunday, a let’s meet the “real Albo” 60 Minutes special will bookend Jenny Morrison, Morrison and his ukulele a couple of weeks back. So you can see where this is all going. But it’s also reasonable to wonder at this juncture why it has taken the Labor campaign so long to colour between the lines. The simple question is this: why is Operation Define Not At All Scary Albo running so late in the political cycle when opinion polls tell us there’s a reasonable chunk of voters who haven’t yet formed a view about the Labor leader? If we cast our memories back to 2007, when Kevin Rudd took on John Howard, and won, Rudd was out telling voters “a number of people have described me as an economic conservative” a full five months before the election.

I bet you do. They are entirely memorable in the sense that peak chutzpah always is. Because Rudd’s serene humblebrag was so ludicrously audacious, the advertisements became a cultural conversation piece, generating a bunch of free media follow-up. Rudd had wanted to lure the Liberals into talking more about him, so that campaign was more than introductory. It was bait, and the bait worked. Now obviously Albanese does talk about his values and background frequently. There have also been a couple of dry run marketing prototypes. In March 2021, there was the “Albo’s story” montage prepared for the ALP national conference. Then in December 2021, for a rally in Sydney’s inner west, there was the “better future” pitch. But neither of those pitches were pushed out forcefully across social media, radio or television to voters who only watch politics out of the corner of their eyes. For weeks, I’ve been wondering when that might change. Given the log cabin narrative is such a basic building block in professional campaigning, the absence has felt deliberate. I’ve wondered whether Albanese has resisted traditional mass market definitional efforts because, fundamentally, he prefers ambiguity. Albanese has prospered this long in politics, in part, because he knows how and when to dance between the raindrops. I haven’t been the only person curious. Some Liberals have also been scratching their heads. Is this a lack of money? Is this some kind of deep, risk aversion? In any case, Morrison, of course, is never one to die wondering. The prime minister has sought to exploit the opening Albanese has left by moving to define the Labor leader himself. If you watch politics closely, you’ll know Morrison’s efforts on this front have intensified significantly over this past month or so. Albanese is weak, and sneaky. The Labor leader is Beijing’s preferred candidate for the election. And so on. From my vantage point, the tone of this desperate barrage landed somewhere between hyperbole and hysteria. But Morrison isn’t talking to me, he’s talking to the disengaged voters that determine the outcome of elections, and some of these people would struggle to identify Albanese in a line-up. People who conduct focus groups for a living, whose judgment I trust, tell me people are deeply angry with Morrison at the moment, but they are not yet volunteering a positive assessment of Albanese in the way voters did, unprompted, about Rudd in 2007. Given Morrison is currently on the rampage, firing indiscriminately, it would make sense for Labor to call time on strategic ambiguity, if this is, in fact, a strategy. Apparently that’s about to happen. People say a campaign defining the Labor leader and the coming contest is hovering in the wings. I suspect it will surface over the coming week or two, on all major mediums. Albanese has copped a fair bit of flak since taking the leadership for playing it safe. But if the polls are right, the leader’s political instincts and judgments have, thus far at least, kept Labor in the contest, at a time when the power of incumbency should wipe any political insurgency off the map. So perhaps he’s right to have left colouring in between the lines this late in the political cycle. Perhaps it’s best to wait until people are fully tuned in. But if Labor loses because voters ultimately don’t feel as if they have a grip on the Morrison alternative – and therefore aren’t confident Albanese means safe change – holding back will have been a big judgment call to get wrong.",News/Australia news,"After the trauma of defeat, it makes sense for Labor to play it safe.

3/12/2022,"The federal government has asked a multinational fertiliser company to stop work on plans to remove Indigenous rock art from a world heritage-nominated area in the Burrup Peninsula after traditional owners raised concerns. Perdaman is planning to build a $4.5bn fertiliser plant in Western Australia’s Burrup Peninsula. The company is already contracted to buy gas used to make the fertiliser from Woodside Energy’s Scarborough gas field. The plant has been strongly supported by both the Western Australian and federal governments, with $255m given to the company to build water and marine infrastructure nearby. Building the plant would, however, require the removal of rock art at three sites. The company has been given approval by the Western Australian government to go ahead with the removal but it is understood it does not yet have the work approvals required to start. The Burrup Peninsula in the Pilbara – known as Murujuga to traditional custodians – is also an outdoor gallery home to over a million examples of Indigenous rock art produced over a period of 50,000 years. The area was nominated for a world heritage listing in 2018. If successful, this would mean the area is protected in the same way as the pyramids of Giza, Stonehenge and the Taj Mahal. While Perdaman has claimed to have the full support of the traditional owners to remove the art, this has been contested. Raelene Cooper, a Mardudhunera woman and former board member of the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation, said elders and members of the community had been misinformed about the nature of work. “The elders never approved this,” Cooper said. “They had no understanding of it. No one had ever explained to them what was really going on. “I mentioned that they were going to start removing the rock art and said they don’t want that. They said so repeatedly.” Perdaman was contacted for comment. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Cooper and another custodian, Josie Alec, wrote to Australia’s environment minister, Sussan Ley, asking her to use emergency powers under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act to stop the rock art removal. In response, the federal environment department asked Perdaman not to go ahead until a review can be carried out. A spokesperson for Ley said the department would review the application to remove the art “as soon as possible”. “At this time the scheduling of works remains a matter for the proponent who must meet all conditions including those relating to the protection of Indigenous cultural heritage,” the spokesperson said. Cooper said the situation had a renewed urgency after the inquiry into the destruction of sacred sites at Juukan Gorge following international outcry. “It’s quite concerning the government would support us in a way with world heritage nomination with all the rock and history, and then turn around, putting a $4.5bn plant in there and remove that history,” Cooper said. “I find it astonishing.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app As well as physical destruction of the rock art by removal, there are also concerns about the cumulative effect of air pollution from increasing industrial development in the area. The University of Western Australia honorary research fellow John Black said air pollution from gas production and other industrial operations builds up on the rock face, where it makes the surface more acidic, causing the paint to break down. “The main problem with urea is that it provides a nitrogen source for microbes and those microbes produce organic acids,” Black said. “The thing about the Murujuga environment is that it was extraordinarily deficient in nitrogen. The only organisms that use to live [in] them were able to convert nitrogen from the air into biological form. “Now what we’re doing is providing various forms of nitrogen as pollution.”",News/Australia news,Fertiliser company urged to halt plans to remove Burrup Peninsula Indigenous rock art,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/12/fertiliser-company-urged-to-halt-plans-to-remove-burrup-peninsula-indigenous-rock-art
3/12/2022,"The first thing that hits you is the smell – the reek of overflowing sewage, rotting animal corpses in the river, decaying vegetable matter, toxic waste, all the things the flood brought up. It gets into your skin that smell. Under a low grey sky in bacterial heat, the town of Coraki is a wasteland, a dystopian nightmare. In the air above us, helicopters drag bales of hay across the brown inland sea that surrounds the town. Piled high outside almost every house, are belongings encased in sludge and mud, the entire lives of the occupants. No one has escaped this disaster. People are still very raw. Coraki is where the Richmond and Wilson rivers meet and the area felt the full brunt of both flooded rivers. On Monday 28 February firefighter Shane Cox was wading around in the water helping people, when he says it “went up another 2 metres”. Dominique Sorrenson had about 4% battery left on her phone when she put a Facebook post up to let people know she was at her house. A power surge had come through her home and cut off her electricity. “I had my elderly father who had health conditions, the next morning a boat rocked up and picked us up because of my Facebook friends,” she says. Coraki was marooned for five days by flood water and residents were forced to fend for themselves without help or supplies. The army broke through on Sunday. People’s legs are cut and bruised from being in contaminated water full of sharp objects. There is a risk of mosquito borne diseases. Electricity has started coming back on in some houses, but the internet is still sporadic. People are living on the streets, under tarpaulins, disoriented, despairing, running on adrenaline. “Everyone,” says volunteer Sharsha Witthahn, “is tired and broken”. The outlying communities are still in the rescue phase. On Thursday private boats were being loaded and launched with provisions and medical supplies for those still out there. For the first time paramedics were on board, after volunteers had become concerned about mental health issues. Volunteer Miriam Meyers says the paramedics were “administering tetanus shots, antibiotics for infections gotten from moving machinery and metal debris, dressing wounds”. “People are presenting with chemical burns because of leaking diesel,” she says. Kate Coxall, a reporter with the Lismore App, a former volunteer firefighter and a trained support facilitator, had thought she might be “overzealous” when she evacuated her daughter and dog from her house at nearby Bungawalbin to her neighbours on Sunday 27 February. “I just felt something was wrong, I moved my landlord’s cows that day from thigh-deep water to the top paddocks,” she says. Returning to her house the next day, she says: “I was absolutely shocked.” She waded through 1.5 metre-deep water to rescue her chickens. On the way back to her neighbour’s house Coxall says she saw a family of five carrying an outboard motor and a boat trying to get to Coraki, nearly 20km away. Some of them were shoeless, one had a big gash on his head. “We begged them, ‘please stay with us, it’s not safe,’ the waters at this point were raging,” she says. “They didn’t listen, and then an hour later we saw an urgent message for emergency services because they had chained themselves in the tinny to a tree.” Coxall spent several hours frantically trying to get help for them before hearing they had been rescued. At her neighbour’s house, the water kept rising. Coxall had left a flashing torch on a fence post, deck lights on and had been waving at passing choppers but they were missed in the cloud cover. They were there for two days with a ladder up against the roof, her neighbour starting to get sepsis in her foot. “There is nothing worse than feeling like you have been left and forgotten and accounted for as collateral damage,” Coxall says. When the ADF chopper finally came she had to leave her dog behind. “She tried to follow us, I will never forget her face.” From the moment she landed in Lismore Coxall was trying to get her dog and other people’s pets rescued. “Gathering GPS coordinates, addresses, numbers of people, numbers of animals and all that sort of thing,” she says. “Organising choppers and going out on boats myself. For us, it is day 14 and we’re still doing rescues.” A few days after her own rescue, her dog was brought out by a private chopper helping in the area. And Coxall, who has lost everything, remains indefatigable in helping the community still out there. “The water is only dropping half a meter each day and … we’ve only lost 5 metres of height,” Coxall says. “If there is more rain they could be out there for another two weeks easily. “Most [locals] have no vehicles left. One of them had a severe back injury, he couldn’t move, he’s there by himself with five dogs. It took us two days to get medication to him. “We’ve got people with cuts, we’re worried about septicaemia and people self-treating with whatever they can get from neighbours. I’m worried about people’s mental and physical health. I’m seriously worried about anyone who may have a time sensitive injury, there are so many brown snakes out there.” Most of the properties are on 100-acre blocks run by tough and stoic people. “They will say other people are worse off than us and they are in a really shit situation,” volunteer Meyers says. “There are people on remote properties who are not on social media, they don’t have the resources to ask for help. If you are not on Instagram no one is going to turn up to help.” Coxall agrees: “Yesterday we suddenly found out that there was a family under tarps with nothing. It is not even as though we have accounted for everybody yet. And that is what is terrifying. We think there are at least 50 people out there.” Some people are choosing not to leave their properties because they have horses and cattle to look after. “They don’t know where they would even go,” Coxall says. “At this point it is about welfare. They are in ankle deep water, none of them are taking care of themselves. They are all troopers, reclusive, they don’t want the fuss. But I can tell you for sure, they are very happy when they see you on the boat.”",News/Australia news,"Where the Richmond and Wilson rivers meet is Coraki, and people there have lost everything",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/12/where-the-richmond-and-wilson-rivers-meet-is-coraki-and-people-there-have-lost-everything
3/12/2022,"The sudden death of the popular Labor senator Kimberley Kitching in Melbourne on Thursday cast a pall over our nation’s capital and shocked politicians from across the spectrum. Tributes surfaced on social media almost immediately after news of her passing. Liberals feted Kitching as a “patriot” and a “warrior”. Labor colleagues, many still in a fog of incomprehension, struggled to process their feelings and shed tears. Kitching will be remembered as an engaging and warm woman, with many deep friendships, a knowing smile, a quick wit, and a wicked sense of humour. She was also a longtime player in the bitterly contested crucible of Victorian Labor politics. In the characteristic way of politics, and power, where friends can be frenemies and then friends again, some colleagues had complicated histories with her. The Victorian rightwinger was still junior in Canberra’s parliamentary pecking order, having entered the Senate in 2016, but being a keen political player, she enjoyed public prominence. After arriving in Canberra, Kitching forged a reputation for her work in foreign affairs and defence, and on human rights. She was a committed foreign policy hawk – an enthusiastic member of the “Wolverines” – a cross-party group of parliamentarians campaigning for a tough stance against China. Kitching controversially used parliamentary privilege in a Senate hearing only last month to name the alleged “puppeteer” behind a Chinese foreign interference plot foiled by the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation. Mike Burgess, the head of Asio, refused to answer Kitching’s question and told her it was “unfair that you ask me that question in public”. Kitching was close to the Liberal senator James Paterson, a fellow Victorian, and a fellow Wolverine, who chairs the joint parliamentary committee on intelligence and security. After news of her death became public, Paterson described Kitching as “a warrior for her cause, a friend of freedom and a true patriot who had an enormous impact in her short time in the Senate”. Accompanying her interest in foreign affairs, intelligence matters and defence, Kitching was also one of the driving forces for Australia to adopt Magnitsky-style laws, allowing targeted sanctions against foreign officials. Her work in spearheading the adoption of these laws – which have been deployed in the current sanctions against Russia after the invasion of Ukraine – saw her win a major human rights award last year. One of her closest friends and confidantes was the former Labor leader Bill Shorten. When she entered the Senate, it was to replace another long-term ally, the rightwinger Stephen Conroy. Born in Brisbane, and a friend of Shorten’s wife, Chloe, since childhood, Kitching studied law and was admitted as a solicitor. She later moved to the private sector, working in corporate roles, before serving on Melbourne city council. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Kitching’s time as general manager of the Health Services Union came under scrutiny during the royal commission into trade unions, with the commissioner, Dyson Heydon, ruling in an interim report that she had sat the right-of-entry tests “on behalf of one or more of” seven other union officials, including the secretary Diana Asmar. Kitching denied the claims. Heydon recommended the commonwealth director of public prosecutions consider prosecuting Asmar and five others for making false statements about the tests, and Kitching for aiding and abetting those contraventions. Charges were not pursued. In 2015, the Fair Work Commission also noted that Kitching had given “untruthful and unreliable evidence” – a point that the Senate noted in 2016 upon her entry to parliament, after a motion from the Liberal senator Eric Abetz. Kitching served in numerous Labor branch roles in Melbourne in the 2000s, and vied for the lower house seats of Lalor and Gellibrand, before joining the Senate. Her candidacy was hotly contested and controversial, with some Labor members privately opposing Kitching’s elevation, but she was eventually elected unopposed by members to the casual vacancy. The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, reportedly threatened to resign if she was appointed, while Anthony Albanese – then a Labor frontbencher, now party leader – refused to back her at the time. Albanese said the situation made the case “for ensuring that members have votes in Senate preselections”, which he said should be “a part of party reform”.

A grief-stricken Shorten said on Friday his friend had been under considerable stress. “Preselections are never easy,” he told the ABC. “I’m not a coroner, I can’t tell you why this woman at 52 was taken from us, but I have no doubt the stress of politics and the machinations in the back rooms had its toll. “She’s a very strong person. She could give as good as she could get. But you take it all home with you, don’t you? Stress is like invisible coats of paint. It’s got to be having its impact. And she was greatly stressed.” Albanese, asked in an ABC TV interview on Friday about the preselection issue, said “politics is a difficult business”. “There are pressures on people in politics. And that is part of what we do. But I certainly think that this was totally unexpected. No one could have anticipated this,” he said.

3/12/2022,"The Morrison government’s plan to restore its power to deport Aboriginal non-citizens has been criticised as “disrespectful and wrong” and a “significant step backwards” in the recognition of Aboriginal societies. Both claims are made in submissions to an appeal by the federal government to overturn the landmark Love and Thoms decision. In February 2020 the high court held in a four-three split that Aboriginal Australians were not aliens for the purpose of the constitution and could not be deported. In November, the federal court ordered the release of Shayne Montgomery, finding it was “not reasonable” to conclude the New Zealand citizen was not Aboriginal because, although he lacked biological descent from an Aboriginal person, he had been culturally adopted as Aboriginal. In its appeal against that decision, the government has sought leave to overturn Love and Thoms, which has resulted in at least 10 people being released from immigration detention since it was handed down. Montgomery’s bid to resist that has been bolstered by interventions by the Victorian government, the Australian Human Rights Commission, National Native Title Council and the Northern Land Council. Montgomery’s lawyers submitted that the commonwealth’s claim there is no clear common reasoning between the four judges in the majority in Love and Thoms “is both disrespectful and wrong”. They contended the point of Love and Thoms “is clear and easy to understand: Aboriginal Australians … have such bonds of attachment to this nation and its territory” that they cannot be subject to the “disabilities of aliens”, such as visa cancellation. They argued the commonwealth was “no more than [a] disappointed litigant”, warning that the “certainty of our legal system would collapse” if the fact the four majority judges expressed their reasoning differently were used to reconsider the precedent. “The appellants … just do not like the result which they obtained from this court.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “That dislike gives them no claim or right to disrupt the legal certainty and authority flowing from the decision of this court.” Montgomery’s lawyers also rejected the commonwealth’s claim that the decision threatens to confer “political sovereignty on Aboriginal societies”, arguing it does not give legislative or constitutional power to Aboriginal societies to determine who is a non-alien. NNTC argued that it should be a matter for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to decide “in any context, who is or who is not an ‘Aboriginal Australian’”. The NNTC described Love and Thoms as a protection against being found to be “aliens” and “like” the second Mabo native title decision “an important step” in the journey to recognise Indigenous connection to Australia and the “enduring authority of tradition law and custom in Aboriginal societies”. “The appellants’ submissions, if accepted, would remove that protection, and – fundamentally – take a significant step backwards in that journey.” The AHRC sought to intervene, warning in its submissions that restoring the power to deport Aboriginal non-citizens would “adversely affect the fundamental rights and interests of individuals” including the “serious interferences with the right to personal liberty”. Overturning the case “may permit a larger group of Indigenous Australians to be permanently removed from Australia”, it said. The AHRC noted the fact that Indigenous births are registered at lower rates than non-Indigenous births, suggesting that people entitled to Australian citizenship who cannot prove they or a parent were born in Australia could be found to be aliens. The Victorian government argued the commonwealth is seeking to “make the same arguments that a majority of the court rejected approximately two years ago”. Although two judges in the majority have retired since the decision, Victoria warned that a change in the composition of the court “is not and never has been reason enough” to overrule previous judgments. The Northern Land Council backed Montgomery’s case that the category of non-citizen non-alien should be extended to those culturally adopted as Indigenous, because descent is determined by cultural not genetic factors in Aboriginal societies. The NNTC also argued that, since not all Aboriginal Australians are native title holders, “some other test or standard” should be used to determine who is a non-citizen non-alien. On Wednesday the high court heard Brendan Thoms’ case about whether his detention was unlawful, which could expose the commonwealth to claims of compensation by non-citizen non-aliens who were detained before the February 2020 high court decision. The Montgomery case is expected to be heard in early April, although Montgomery has sought to have the case permanently stayed.",News/Australia news,‘Disrespectful and wrong’: lawyers slam Coalition’s push to restore power to deport Aboriginal non-citizens,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/12/disrespectful-and-wrong-lawyers-slam-coalitions-push-to-restore-power-to-deport-aboriginal-non-citizens
3/12/2022,"Small and crudely-formed, the hidden tunnel at Whiskey 108 almost went undetected. Concealed under a pile of grass, it might never have been discovered save for the forensic attention of an Australian SAS boot. But now that simple tunnel – and most critically, if anybody was found inside it – has emerged as a crucial inflection point upon which the defamation trial brought by Ben Roberts-Smith could turn. Roberts-Smith, the recipient of Australia’s highest military honour, the Victoria Cross, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of reports he alleges portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies any wrongdoing. For all the complexity of this case, a key question in its outcome will be a very simple one: were there any people inside the tunnel at Whiskey 108? Two irreconcilable versions of events have emerged around that tunnel. Roberts-Smith has repeatedly told the court the tunnel contained a cache of arms, but no people. Four times during his evidence to court, Roberts-Smith has told Justice Anthony Besanko “there were no men in the tunnel”, or “there were no people in the tunnel”. But so far this trial, five SAS soldiers – some still serving – have told the court they saw men pulled from the tunnel. The presence of those men, or otherwise, is key because of what is alleged to have happened next. The newspapers claim the two men pulled from the tunnel were later murdered: one, a disabled man with a prosthetic leg, was allegedly machine-gunned by Roberts-Smith himself, his leg later souvenired by another soldier as a ghoulish trophy of war, a drinking vessel for celebrating soldiers; the other, an elderly man, was allegedly executed by another soldier on Roberts-Smith’s orders, a “blooding” of a new trooper. Roberts-Smith denies this ever happened, says it could never have happened, because there was never anybody in the tunnel. Whiskey 108 was the name given by the SAS to a compound in the village of Kakarak, a known stronghold and arms base for Taliban insurgents on the western side of the Dorafshan River in Afghanistan’s southern Uruzgan province. Australian SAS troops had been “outside the wire” in the province for several days before they received an order, late in the afternoon of 12 April 2009, to move on Whiskey 108. An airstrike was called in, a bomb dropped into the middle of the compound, and they fought their way through the river valley’s “green zone”, killing at least two insurgents en route, to the perimeter of the mud-walled compound. After the fight-through to secure the compound – which passed without significant incident – the patrol commanders gathered in a courtyard, amid the rubble of the bombed-out compound, to plan the next phase of the operation. It was then that one soldier, moving a pile of grass to check what lay beneath, discovered the entrance to a tiny tunnel. Straight away, the Australian soldiers had their guns trained down the hole. It is here that the versions of events described to the court diverge, and part irreconcilably. The testimony from six SAS soldiers has focused on what happened next at Whiskey 108. Five soldiers have said they saw people emerge from the tunnel, one has said he saw two Afghan men in the custody of Australian troops next to the tunnel entrance. The soldiers’ testimonies have not been identical. In some versions of events, Australian troops called themselves for anyone in the tunnel to surrender and come out, in others, the message was relayed through an interpreter, assisted by two Afghan women who had been detained in the compound. One soldier has told the court he put his head and shoulders inside the tunnel and saw two men inside. Another soldier, Person 43, said while he recalled there were two “persons under control” found at Whiskey 108, he had recollections he helped only one come out of the tunnel. He told the court he knelt down beside the tunnel to help drag the unarmed man out. “He started to stand up and I reached down and pulled him out. “He wasn’t resisting,” Person 43 said, “his hands were up in the universal ‘I give up’ position.” Another serving soldier, Person 40, said he watched two men emerge. “They were obviously very frightened. One had a distinctive limp … immediately [upon] coming out of his tunnel he was lifting his trousers, pointing to his prosthetic leg, expecting some sympathy from the troops.” Person 40 said both men, whom he believed were Taliban, were searched, “and from there they were marched off to another area, by Roberts-Smith and Person 35 [another Australian soldier]”. “My understanding is that they would be TQed (tactically questioned), and Ben Roberts-Smith was the lead TQer on the ground.” Person 40 said he expected the men to be taken back to the Australians’ Tarin Kowt base: “That’s the SOP (standard operating procedure).” However, Person 40 told the court no prisoners were taken back to Tarin Kowt from that mission. He never saw the men alive again. One soldier, anonymised as Person 41, gave evidence to the court about an alleged execution at Whiskey 108. He told the court he was investigating a room inside the compound where he had discovered bomb-making materials and opium when he emerged into a courtyard to see Roberts-Smith and another soldier, known as Person 4, standing above a kneeling elderly Afghan male, near the entrance to a tunnel. Person 41 said: “RS [Roberts-Smith] walked down and grabbed the Afghan male by the scruff of his shirt.” He said Roberts-Smith walked the man about two metres until he was in front of Person 4, “then kicked him in the back of the legs behind the knees until he was kneeling down … RS pointed to the Afghan and said to Person 4 ‘shoot him’.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app Person 41 said he did not want to witness what he realised was about to occur, and stepped back into the room where he had previously been. He said he heard a muffled round fired from an M4 rifle – “I’ve fired thousands of those rounds and I know what they sound like”. He waited another “15 or so seconds” before stepping back into the courtyard. He said Roberts-Smith was no longer in the courtyard, but Person 4 was standing above the Afghan male, who was dead from a single bullet wound to the head. He inspected the body. “There was quite a lot of blood flowing from the head wound.” The two Australian soldiers did not speak. “He seemed to be in a bit of shock to me.” Person 4, subpoenaed as a witness by the newspapers, spent nearly a week in the witness box during this trial. While he gave evidence about other SAS missions he participated in, Person 4 objected to answering questions about his actions at Whiskey 108: “I object on grounds of self-incrimination,” he told the court. After intense legal debate over whether he should be compelled to respond, the judge ruled he did not have to answer. Person 41 also gave evidence about standing in a cordon outside the Whiskey 108 compound following the Australian fight-through, telling the court, as he stood guard, he saw Roberts-Smith “frog-marching” an Afghan man “by the scruff of his neck” away from the compound entrance. “He [Roberts-Smith] had his machine gun in his right arm … he then proceeded to throw the Afghan male down onto the ground. The Afghan male landed on his back. ‘RS’ then reached down and grabbed him by the shoulder and flipped him onto his stomach. Then I observed him lower his machine gun and shoot approximately three to five rounds into the back of the Afghan male.” “After he’d done that, he looked up and saw me standing there, and looked at me and said ‘are we all cool, we good?’. I just replied, ‘yeah mate, no worries’.” Another soldier was also in the cordon surrounding the compound. Person 14 said the light was fading when he heard heavy footsteps to his right. “As I turned my head to my right, there were three Australian soldiers and a black object, which was similar to a human, that was thrown to the ground.” Person 14 said the person made a thudding, “expulsion of air” noise as they hit the ground. “Then a soldier raised their Minimi F89 Para and fired an extended burst. It was loud, like a ‘BRRRRRT’ for one second.” “That person turned and walked away out of sight back into Whiskey 108.” Person 14 said he turned to his patrol’s second-in-command and said “what the hell what that?” He said he did not recognise the soldier who fired at the time. But Person 14 said the soldier who shot the man was wearing a distinctive new camouflage paint, worn only by one SAS patrol in action that day, the five-man team of which Roberts-Smith was a member. Person 14 later checked the body of the slain man – he had gunshot wounds to the centre of his torso and blood coming from his mouth and nose. Person 14 saw that the man had a prosthetic leg. Later in the day, Person 14 told the court he saw Roberts-Smith carrying the distinctive Minimi weapon at the troops’ lay-up point. “I saw who had the Para Minimi [machine gun],” he said. “It was Ben Roberts-Smith.” Roberts-Smith has been resolute in his evidence. In June last year, under cross-examination, he was repeatedly asked about what happened at Whiskey 108. Four times he told the court “there were no men in the tunnel” or “there were no people in the tunnel”. He said testimony that men were pulled from the tunnel was “completely false”. It is not disputed Roberts-Smith shot and killed the man with the prosthetic leg. Roberts-Smith told the court he killed the man because he was a threat to Australian troops. Roberts-Smith said he saw him, armed and running, and killed him in accordance with troops’ rules of engagement. Roberts-Smith told the court he was standing outside the compound when he saw the man, “not running directly at me, but coming on an arc”. “He had his hand over the top of the weapon, because he was carrying it down next to his body like that … hunched over, as in, running like that with his shoulders down.” Roberts-Smith said the other man killed at Whiskey 108 was also an insurgent, also armed, and killed in combat by another Australian soldier. Roberts-Smith said after he had killed the man with a prosthetic leg he had a weapons stoppage, as he was kneeling to fix it, another SAS soldier shot and killed the second man. “My assumption was it was someone in my team, so either Person 18 or Person 4 was my assumption, but I actually don’t know.” Under cross-examination, he was asked “this is a person who, on your account, saved your life? “Yes,” Roberts-Smith replied, but said, to this day, he does not know which soldier it was. In the witness box, Person 18 denied being involved in a firefight at Whiskey 108. Person 4 was not questioned on his actions at Whiskey 108. Under cross-examination, the SAS witnesses who have been questioned over Whiskey 108 over the past fortnight have been asked whether their memories of the mission are hazy or faulty, whether they have conflated Whiskey 108 with other operations, or whether their stories were confected out of malice to harm Roberts-Smith. They have denied those assertions, and reaffirmed their evidence. This trial has weeks left still to run. The newspapers are only partway through their witnesses. Roberts-Smith may call up to 20 witnesses-in-reply. He may even take the stand again himself in order to rebut some of the allegations against him, though he has already given his version of events at Whiskey 108. For all of the vast sweep of this mammoth trial, a simple tunnel dug into the soil of Afghanistan could prove critical: was there anyone inside?",News/Australia news,Tunnel vision: why the Ben Roberts-Smith trial could turn on a tiny secret crawlspace in an Afghan village,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/12/tunnel-vision-why-the-ben-roberts-smith-trial-could-turn-on-a-tiny-secret-crawlspace-in-an-afghan-village
3/12/2022,"Walking through rows of white-netted grapevines, Andrew Barnes pauses to lift the fabric and pick a syrah grape. Originally, his idea had been to simply plant a few vines in his back yard. “I’d always wanted some grapes on a property,” he says. But the project snowballed: He leased one vineyard, then two. “We realised suddenly that we were producing a huge amount of wine – it had gone from being what was having a few grapes on the property to a wine lake,” Barnes laughs, looking around at the hillside of vines. “I’m flippin’ hopeless – it goes out of control.” Barnes, one of the pioneers of the four-day week, has an apparent penchant for projects that metastasise far beyond their original boundaries. As with grapevines, so with the four-day week. What began as an experiment with one of his own businesses in 2018 has expanded into a rapidly multiplying series of international pilots in Ireland, the US, UK, Israel, and Australia-Pacific regions, working with universities around the world to study the results. 4 Day Week Global, the non-profit Barnes co-founded with Charlotte Lockhart, is expecting to run trials with 300-500 companies internationally this year. Today, he is speaking from one of his vineyards on Waiheke Island, a tiny island off the north-eastern coast of New Zealand. On the scale of a globe, it’s a speck of land off the coast of a dot, and it is from here that Barnes hopes to transform the world of work and wrench the world of employment away from the deadlock of 40 hours. “There’s a lot of naysayers,” he says. “But there’s now a lot of evidence to say this works – so what’s to be lost in trying? Because you know, nobody ever advanced humankind by saying it’s not gonna work.” Around the world, the 4-day week movement has been gathering steam. Barnes was at the vanguard back in 2018, after reading an Economist article saying many workers were only productive for 1.5-3 hours a day. It struck him that by clawing back even one extra hour a day, the company would be more productive. Barnes decided to trial reduced hours for all 240 employees at one of his businesses, trusts firm Perpetual Guardian. He instituted an 80-100-100 rule: 80% hours, to accomplish 100% of the work, for 100% pay. The experiment worked. Productivity rose, staff were happier. He made the change permanent. Since then, the idea has only grown in popularity, Microsoft Japan trialled the concept in 2019 and said productivity jumped 40%. Unilever New Zealand announced a year-long trial of the four-day week in 2021; by the end of the year, they had opted to extend it. In Iceland, trials of a 35-hour work week run by Reykjavík city council and the national government included about 1% of Iceland’s working population. In Spain, the government accepted proposals for a pilot where the government would support a national private-sector trial of the four-day week last year. Barnes’ conviction has only solidified over time – if implemented properly, he says, it’s a no-lose proposition. A National Business Review rich-lister with a reported net worth of around $180m, he is adamant that it’s as much a business priority as a social one. “Right at the heart of this is a rational business decision,” he says, “as well as being probably one of the most socially responsible and environmentally responsible things you could do.” Gregarious and expressive, Barnes speaks with the conviction of an evangelist. His own approach and motivations were partly forged as a young investment banker in the UK, working punishing hours in a brutally competitive sector. In the years since, little seems to have changed at those firms – last year, a leaked internal survey from Goldman Sachs reported “inhumane,” abusive conditions and 100-hour weeks. In his memoir, Barnes denounces a culture that treats people like race horses: whipping them to do your bidding, running them down until they flame out. His own great conversion moment came in Sydney, where he had reached the coveted level of executive director at enormous global financial services group Macquarie. He loathed it. Walking along the city shoreline, a line from Nick Hornby’s book Fever Pitch kept running through his head: “You can’t remember whether life’s shit because Arsenal are shit, or the other way around.” “I hated my life. I hated everything,” Barnes says. “The question was, why do I hate Sydney? Do I hate Sydney because Sydney is awful? Or is Sydney awful because my life is awful?” He concluded it was the latter. Barnes left investment banking to take time off, and vowed not to replicate the culture at Macquarie, which he said encouraged overwork. Going forward, he says, “I adopted a philosophy that said: I would think about what Macquarie would do, and then do precisely the opposite.” Now, Barnes is seeking a revolution of the week as it currently stands. He sees it as a tired, unimaginative hangover of early 20th-century assembly lines: “an arbitrary construct based on repetitive manufacturing,” he says, leaning forward at one of the vineyard’s outdoor tables to run off a string of rhetorical questions. “What Henry Ford did in the 1920s – even then, why was it relevant to office work? Why was it relevant for agriculture? Why was it relevant for anything?” Barnes asks. “We decided to have a working week of 40 hours per week – who decided that was it? Why is that the pinnacle of human achievement?” Western societies have made various unsuccessful attempts to dislodge their routines from what historian David Henkin dubs our “recalcitrant calendar unit”. The Soviet Union spent more than a decade experimenting with the nepreryvka, a 5-day week without shared weekends. Post-revolution, the French attempted a 10-day week as part of a broader project to de-Christianise the calendar. Both failed to stick. The 40-hour working week, moored within its seven-day cycle, has proven startlingly stubborn. Any fundamental change to the way we arrange working time can be hard to get one’s head around, says Dr Laura Giurge, an assistant professor at London School of Economics, who studies time, wellbeing and the future of work. “The long-term benefits of just trying it can really outweigh any potential cost. So I think [the barrier] primarily could be psychological. It’s just the inertia: oh, I’m not gonna try because what I have now is doing OK.” For some managers, maintaining the status quo seems easier than having to establish new ways of measuring what a productive worker really is. “We’ve seen leaders staying a little bit in the past,” she says. “Because it’s really hard to measure performance nowadays, they continue to rely on old metrics of performance, such as valuing long work hours or instant responsiveness – as opposed to really focusing on what people actually do, and what’s the quality of the work that they do.” Giurge is a research affiliate of Oxford University’s wellbeing centre, where she works as part of the academic board for 4 Day Week Global, to assess the effects of their trials on productivity and worker wellbeing. She says there’s still more research to be done on increasing productivity in fewer hours. But broadly, the indications are positive. “Being able to disconnect from work and disengage from work and recharge is really beneficial not just for our wellbeing but also for productivity,” Giurge says. “We come back more engaged, we come back with more energy at work, and we’re less likely to make mistakes and we’re more motivated to put effort into the things that we care about.” That’s all very well if you’re drafting wills, or staring at a computer screen all day, or, for that matter, a CEO speaking from one of your sunny vineyards on Waiheke. But what about nurses, cleaners, shopkeepers and waiters – those for whom it’s harder to imagine 100% of work being accomplished in 80% of the hours? One of the criticisms of the four-day week is the extent to which the conversation has been dominated by the white collar sectors, the desk workers, those who tend to have existing layers of wealth and privilege. Barnes argues the potential for reduced hours is not restricted to white-collar workers – it just requires assessing different workplaces at systems level. “In things like retail, hospitality, it’s the two dynamics you’re looking at: do you get better output? But also, does your cost base change as a consequence of not having turnover, sick days, somebody not showing up … You have to look at it in the macro,” he says. Businesses currently lose huge amounts of money to staff turnover and burnout, sick days, disengaged employees, errors, and duplicated work. Studies have found, for example, that the full cost of replacing a nurse was between 30% and 130% of their salary. For other employees, Gallup puts the cost at between 20% and 200%. With the pandemic knocking the traditional workplace off its axis, reduced hours feel increasingly like an idea whose time has come. “Four Day Week has been given rocket fuel because of Covid,” Barnes says. There were two obvious effects: firstly, an enormous number of workers were sent to work from home – and time in the office was suddenly and forcibly disintegrated as a proxy for productivity. The second was that workers, freed from constant supervision, still seemed to do their work. “[It addressed] two of the big issues we always faced,” says Barnes. “How do I measure output? And how do I trust my workforce? Well, you sort of had that answer.” The third effect has been dubbed the great resignation: workers in the US left their jobs at historic rates toward the end of 2021, with a record 4.5 million quitting in November. In the UK, nearly 1.2m jobs were open, with many employers struggling for applicants. The reasons are complex, but the pandemic highlighted modern work’s unsustainable qualities – burnout, stagnating wages, lack of childcare, the need for work-life balance. Some employees are now in a position of market power, and demanding better. But most of the sweeteners that businesses offer employees – gym memberships or foosball or training or free lunches – aren’t highly motivating, Barnes says, because what appeals to one worker leaves another cold. Time, on the other hand, he says is endlessly personal: a person can use it for family, for hobbies, for rest, for side-hustles, for education. “When you give people back time, you individualise the incentive,” he says. “What I’m doing is I’m giving you the time, when you want it, so you can do the things that matter to you. And you can’t put a price on that.” Increasingly, it is the value of these things that Barnes seems fascinated by. In his own life, he has reached what might be considered capitalism’s heights: multimillionaire, serial entrepreneur, owner and director of global companies. But over time, it seems he has become increasingly convinced that those ends might not really what most of us are seeking. His own work, and success, he says, has come at a cost; two marriages, and children living on another continent. He launches into another string of rhetorical questions. “Is that good? Can I get that back? And why – because I decided that working was more important than absolutely everything else. Is it?” he asks. He answers himself: “Not really.” From amid the sunshine, the vines and luxury, he will keep working to extend to others the luxury he now particularly values – time.",Lifestyle/Money,The New Zealander trying to revolutionise the working week: ‘It’s a rational business decision’,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/12/the-new-zealander-trying-to-revolutionise-the-working-week-its-a-rational-business-decision
3/12/2022,"Amy Clucas was 30 years old the first time she ever put on footy boots. The now-nurse grew up in Perth alongside her two sisters in a netball-oriented household, with a Sherrin nowhere in sight – a common tale for girls her age back then. Later in her adult years, she found herself spending a lot of time at Melville Rams Football Club due to her partner playing there, where interest in a women’s team was growing. Then last year, to help with numbers for the first female team that was emerging, she put on her trainers for a run around and “basically just fell in love”. Now, she’s the vice president of the club. Two of her main sources of motivation, she says, are Collingwood’s AFLW star Ash Brazill and former player Sharni Norder who, like her, both come from netball backgrounds. “Those two are definitely my two inspiring women in the AFLW,” she says. Clucas’s story is not wholly uncommon. The AFLW is often praised for inspiring the next generation of girls coming through the Australian rules football ranks, and is credited for the increasing rates of female kids taking up the sport. But it is not just the young ones the league is inspiring. Across Australia, the AFLW has spurred on vast amounts of women aged 20 and above to lace up footy boots for the first time and give what so many of them were denied as youngsters – because of their gender – a crack. Take Kelly Ford, 47, who grew up swimming, playing touch footy and tennis in Lakes Entrance, as Australian rules football was not an option for her. Two years ago, at the age of 45 and after having twins, she thought ‘why not?’ and joined her local footy club, Elsternwick Amateurs to learn the skills from scratch. She says the introduction of the AFLW “most definitely” has increased the participation rates of her club’s division, which feature mostly women in their late 20s to early 30s. “You see these women [AFLW players] and you go ‘Wow, look at these women…they’re doing what we all kind of always wanted to do’,” says Ford. “The girls, the culture down there, it’s just fantastic. And it just sort of gave me a bit of confidence – not that I was going to be any star player, because I wasn’t. But just give me a little bit more confidence in myself”. Then, there’s Kel Rowe, 34, who grew up in Brisbane dabbling in Aussie rules as a kid during high school, but gave it up after graduating because there weren’t any available options for her to continue. Fast forward to 2019, after she moved to Melbourne for work,, and she found herself in the stands for a Western Bulldogs v Geelong Cats AFLW game. “I remember going and sitting and watching this game and being like, ‘man, this is this amazing’. It immediately took me back to when I played footy as a kid, and as a teenager, and I was like, ‘I really want to do this again’.” So, she joined her local club, the Footscray Roosters, where she’s now also on the committee and helps out with social media. In that latter roles, she says that enquires from women aged 20 and above spike every year with the beginning of the AFLW season. At Queensland’s Sherwood Football Club, every year the women’s senior playing list sees a growth of around 20-30%, with players ranging from sixteen-year-olds through to women in their late 40s. Club president Andrew Thomson notes that before the advent of the AFLW, they had a women’s team as early as 1972, and from 2004 to 2014, but getting enough players and support made it difficult to maintain. “The introduction of the AFLW changed this completely,” he says, attributing increased support from local governing bodies, including funding and strategic planning. Women’s football director Lahnie Cooper agrees, saying the AFLW has had a flow-on effect where “local football teams are expanding”. Notably, this includes also putting the idea of playing footy themselves on the radar for a lot of women, who now have somewhere to sign up. “One thing a lot of new participants to the game that have come to us later in life have said is: ‘Now our daughters have been able to play the game and now I can play it as well’,” says Dr Adrian Raftery, general manager of AFL Masters, the division for players 35 years and over. “Age is just a number. We’re all five-year-olds. We’re just different sizes and shapes and maybe have a few more wrinkles.” He says that off the coattails of the AFLW’s inaugural season, AFL Masters developed a women’s division, which had three teams the first year, and has now grown to 12. The AFLW and all its players are making massive inroads when it comes to developing the sport in Australia, from grassroots up. And this includes motivating women in their 20s, 30s, 40s and above to take the sport up socially or competitively at their local clubs. “It’s the people who have never ever picked up a football, have wanted to, but have never had the confidence to do it… those are the ones that to me are the success stories,” says Cooper.",Sport/Sport,‘Age is just a number’: the women inspired by AFLW to take up footy later in life | Marnie Vinall,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/12/age-is-just-a-number-the-women-inspired-by-aflw-to-take-up-footy-later-in-life
3/12/2022,"As darkness descended on the northern rivers town of Ballina, a ragtag fleet of taxis, trucks and school buses began pulling up outside the town’s small hospital, ready to take part in an extraordinary mission. The 55-odd patients inside were at risk. Floods were inundating the northern rivers, and authorities believed the Richmond River would burst its banks, swelled by the basin’s unprecedented saturation and a looming high tide. The order was issued at 6pm on 1 March: the entire hospital was to be evacuated to a local high school, Xavier Catholic College in nearby Skennars Head. It meant moving palliative care patients, dementia sufferers, the immobile and stroke victims. Staff were given three hours to prepare. Among the three doctors on shift was Dr Katie Treble. The past 24 hours had sharpened her resolve. Treble, along with her dog, Jeff Bridges, had spent the previous day stuck on the roof of her inundated home in low-lying Mullumbimby. “I thought ‘no one predicted what happened in Mullum yesterday, and I’ve lost all my stuff, my house is under water and my car’s gone, so I’m not going to take any chances’,” she says. “There was no way I was having my patients go through what we went through.” The complexity of dismantling an entire hospital and setting it up again – at a school, of all places – in three hours is mind-boggling. Here, staff had to do it in the middle of a flood disaster, in the dark, knowing they might be overwhelmed by patients in coming days. Treble still isn’t sure who organised the vehicles. But they began to arrive at the hospital in numbers. So did the State Emergency Service, which offered to help however it could. School buses were used for patients who could walk. The hospital’s sickest were transported via ambulance. Taxis, trucks and SES vehicles were used to transport ultrasound gear, trolleys, air mattresses, huge stocks of medicines, bags of fluid, and airway equipment. Some patients were incredibly difficult to move. “A lot of them are confused, don’t understand what is going on, and a lot of them are pretty bed-bound too,” Treble says. Xavier College’s hall was transformed into a general ward using a sea of inflatable mattresses, each with an IV pole and stand. Taped to the end of each bed was a piece of A4 paper, recording a number and name for each patient. Monitors were run from batteries, and staff, lacking a usable IT system, converted all electronic records to paper form. A classroom was set up as the triage area for new patients, where a nurse waited for arrivals, standing in front of a two-by-two-metre screen, designed to give some semblance of privacy. The classroom whiteboards were used to track patients and outstanding jobs and orders. “It had the opportunity to be just a terrible shit-show, and it was the opposite,” Treble says. “It was slick and the communication between the team was good, I think everybody understood what role they had and the attitude of everybody was very much ‘can-do’ and ‘how do I help?’.” Another classroom was used as a resuscitation area. A GP clinic and mental health unit were set up in other parts of the school. Soon, the volunteers began to arrive. Doctors, nurses and hospital staff turned up in uniform, unpaid and unexpected, after hearing of the evacuation. Many, including emergency doctor Shaska Khosa, were arriving from extraordinary situations of their own. A day earlier, Khosa, who lives in Brunswick Heads, had launched a boat from a flooded street with her partner, Tom Lee Lewes, and joined a convoy of police rescue and surf lifesaving vessels to Mullumbimby. “We were just grabbing people from their houses and taking them up to slightly higher ground,” she says. Khosa arrived at the high school at 2am one morning, expecting to stay for six hours to help. She worked a 14-hour shift. There was no phone signal, she says, and some of the usual services a hospital relies on – including pathology – were nonexistent. The flood disaster had cut off access to other regional medical centres, leading to an influx to the high school. Somehow, though, the hospital worked.

The evacuation, like so much of what’s occurred in the northern rivers, was unprecedented. Neither Treble, who worked for Médecins Sans Frontières in Central African Republic, nor Khosa have ever been involved in anything like it. “I don’t think I’ve ever heard of anyone having to evacuate a hospital in three hours,” Treble says. “I’ve never heard of it, not in the developed world, anyway. “But we had an amazing team.”",News/Australia news,‘It was weirdly functional’: the inside story of the extraordinary evacuation of Ballina hospital,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/12/it-was-weirdly-functional-the-inside-story-of-the-extraordinary-evacuation-of-ballina-hospital
3/12/2022,"Here’s Ky Furneaux, acting as a stunt double for Sharon Stone in Catwoman. Here’s Furneaux, hunting feral goats with a bow and arrow. Here’s Furneaux, at an Adelaide private school, a sea of yellow and white gingham uniforms on manicured green lawns. Here’s Furneaux, practically sitting on her modem as we talk on WhatsApp, the signal from outback South Australia sketchy. Her only other option is to perch on the roof of her ute, she says, through the slightly awkward delay down the line. Because we’re both from Adelaide, we naturally chat about the school we went to – the same one, Pembroke. Until then Furneaux, now 48, had been at a local state school. “My parents were like, ‘we have got to get her into a private school. She’s never going to pass’,” she says. She was 19 and headed towards a career in business management or marketing when she broke her back in a car accident. After being bedridden and told she would have only limited mobility – which fortunately turned out not to be the case – she realised she wanted to travel, to be physically challenged and to be outside. Skip to Vancouver, where she started training with Kirk Jacques, whose website names Scarlett Johansson and Woody Harrelson among his previous clients. Jacques taught Furneaux “film fighting” – modified kickboxing, taekwondo and weaponry. Furneaux says it was more like “relearning, not learning” to fight. Initially she had no plans to pursue a career in the movies, but after “three really long, hard years of working my arse off”, an unexpected opportunity arose. “I just got lucky because Sharon Stone came to town and needed another five foot eight double who knew kickboxing. That was quite a fast track. I felt incredibly out of my depth.” She expected to start out with small bits – “you might just run out of the way of a car or something” – but soon she was in fight sequences with Halle Berry (Catwoman to Stone’s villainous Laurel Hedare). Furneaux spent about 16 years doubling for stars, including Jennifer Garner and Anne Hathaway. She won the Taurus World Stunt Award for her work on the set of Thor, doubling for Jaimie Alexander who played alongside Chris Hemsworth. After 16 years of bumps and bruises – and an incident where she tore her hamstring off the bone – Furneaux was starting to quieten down. But she was still doing bits and pieces of stuntwork in the United States when her sister called her. It was early 2020. “She said: ‘You need to decide today where you’re going to be for the next two years. If Australia is where you want to be you need to be on a flight tomorrow’,” Furneaux says. She chose to sit out the pandemic in Australia, and her partner Calem O’Grady joined her. Before long they were shooting a documentary at her cousin’s farm near Peterborough, about three hours north of Adelaide. That’s where she had first started hunting goats. “I was vegetarian … then I decided if I was going to eat meat, I wanted to do it in the most sustainable way possible, which is hunting your own meat,” she says. “And I really don’t like guns. So I picked up a bow and arrow and it just felt right.” I ask for her favourite goat recipe, and she defers to O’Grady’s talents. The former chef makes a mean goat curry. “He puts the bones in it as well, so you get all the marrow, and it’s really, it’s just delicious,” she says. Asked how her friends and family have reacted to her goat hunting past-time after her Catwoman-hunting past, she says: “I don’t think anyone’s surprised at anything I do any more. “I think I’m just wired a little bit differently. I said ‘yeah, I’m going to get into extreme survival now’.” Extreme survival, Furneaux points out, is not like being a doomsday prepper. It’s being able to survive off the land, to hunt your own food, to understand nature. The line starts to crackle and fade as Furneaux talks about upcoming projects. A book due out (“the first survival guide of its kind written by a female”), another television show. Surviving, extremely. I ask her what she’s afraid of. “Every time before I get up in front of a big crowd, I’m terrified,” she says, acknowledging it’s part of the gig to promote her work and as a motivational speaker.

3/12/2022,"It was an appropriately apocalyptic day for the preview of the 23rd Sydney biennale. The Colombian director José Roca has titled it rīvus, which means “stream”: a deep examination of all things watery, from the drowning of Pacific Islands to the loss of fishing cultures during the slow destruction of climate change. That Tuesday, as massive floods inundated eastern Australia, New South Wales authorities warned people to stay at home unless it was strictly necessary. The show went on. And it was a soggy triumph. Constant rain during the eight-hour, six-venue marathon only added to the urgency of the message. “Rivers, wetlands and other salt and freshwater ecosystems feature in the biennale … as dynamic living systems with varying degrees of political agency,” Roca has previously said. “Indigenous knowledges have long understood non-human entities as living ancestral beings with a right to life that must be protected. But only recently have animals, plants, mountains and bodies of water been granted legal personhood. If we can recognise them as individual beings, what might they say?” There are many beautiful, worrying and enlightening answers to this question in the show’s 330 artworks – by 89 participants – and 400 events involving individual artists and groups from all over the world. Rainwater washed down the high sandstone walls of the Cutaway at Barangaroo; vast installations were carefully protected from it. Sydney-based artist Clare Milledge made a beautiful, large-scale silk tent housing hanging copper cauldrons, coils of shipping and climbing rope, suspended glass paintings and more things germane to her topic. Her installation, titled Imbás: a well at the bottom of the sea, imagined Sinnan, the goddess of the River Shannon in Ireland, who is said to have journeyed to a deep spring seeking wisdom, and from it she released poetry into the world. The British-Finnish artist, composer and performer Hanna Tuulikki spoke about her new video, Seals’kin, which deals with mythical Norse selkies, who can transform from seals to humans, shedding their skin each time. In the myths, she said, humans would sometimes be abducted to the underwater kingdom orseals would become trapped on land after losing their skin. As Tuulikki studied the stories, she came to understand them as “mass bereavement allegories about loss and longing” in coastal communities. She will sing traditional shanties about them while she is here. Indigenous Australian artists also have much to say at the biennale. Trawlwoolway artist Julie Gough put together a video from kayak trips she took on the Macquarie River and adjoining waterways in Tasmania: it lies horizontal on the floor at the Curaway, with her kayak suspended and plastered with stickers of stones stolen and held in museums around the world – out of country. Once she received the biennale’s commission, Gough paddled without knowing her end goal, hoping the river would provide an answer. It was a risk, but at the end of the Mersey River, where it runs into the sea at Devonport, she found Native Rock. “The names gave me the clue,” she says. She researched the place and learned it was the site of a massacre. “The people of that region held a last stand at that rock,” she says. “There is no surviving family or any people from that region.” Barkandji artist Badger Bates is a tireless waterways activist. At the Art Gallery of NSW, his black and white linocuts, based on the geography of tributaries and lakes of the Barka (Darling River) and the teachings of his Granny Moysey, have been blown up to meander around several walls. This serves as a background to an installation of carved canoes – one by Bates – and sculptures that highlight the river fish being killed by local industries that produce chemical waste. At Barangaroo, The Great Animal Orchestra is a powerful audio-visual work of animal voices accompanied by bright electronic signals of their sounds. Here, sound is the focus, accompanied by something mesmerising to watch. “When people hear this kind of theme for life on earth and our relationship to that, they’re going to come away changed,” said Bernie Krause, a US musician and soundscape ecologist who worked with London-based collective United Visual Artists to make the artwork. There is a lot to see at six venues across the city. At the Museum of Contemporary Art, Slovenian artist and architect Marjetica Potrč presents a new work, The House of Agreement Between Humans and the Earth, a structure that examines the relationship between people and the natural world. This and her signature wall drawings tell the stories of two rivers: the Soča in Slovenia and the Galari (Lachlan River) on Wiradjuri country. And Chilean artist Paula de Solminihac has two wall hangings of printed ink and fine paper, across from scrawls of algebraic calculations. Roca, the biennale’s director, had intended to minimise his carbon footprint by moving to Sydney for the duration of the show’s preparation. Two years of travel restrictions during the Covid-19 pandemic minimised it even further and prevented his wife, a lawyer, from working. The end result is a diverse collection of artworks and a powerful piece of advocacy for our planet.

3/12/2022,"Russia has accused Ukraine and the US at the UN security council of a plot to use migratory birds and bats to spread pathogens, raising alarm among other council members that the accusations could be intended to provide cover for future Russian use of biological weapons. The Russian permanent representative to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, delivered a lengthy account of the alleged biological weapons plot, and said the birds, bats and insects supposedly intended to spread disease would cross Ukraine’s western border. “We call upon you to think about a very real biological danger to the people in European countries, which can result from an uncontrolled spread of bio agents from Ukraine,” Nebenzya said. “And if there is a such a scenario then all Europe will be covered. “The risk of this is very real given the interests of the radical nationalist groups in Ukraine are showing towards the work with dangerous pathogens conducted together with the ministry of defence of the United States.” The United Nations high representative for disarmament, Izumi Nakamitsu, said the UN was “not aware of any biological weapons programmes” in Ukraine, and pointed out there was an official channel for governments to raise any concerns about violations of the biological and toxin weapons convention banning their use. In response to Nebenzya’s claims, several member states on the security council warned that it could be a disinformation campaign ahead of a planned Russian attack inside Ukraine. “The intent behind these lies seems clear and it is deeply troubling,” said Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN. “We believe Russia could use chemical or biological agents for assassinations as part of a false flag incident or to support tactical military operations.” Before the UN session, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, expressed similar concerns. “Allegedly, we are preparing a chemical attack,” Zelenskiy said in a video address on Thursday. “This makes me really worried, because we’ve been repeatedly convinced: if you want to know Russia’s plans, look at what Russia accuses others of.” Russian forces have continued their advance into Ukraine, bombing cities in the west of the country, including Lviv, Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk. Elsewhere, satellite photos appeared to show a massive convoy outside Kyiv had largely dispersed and redeployed. The US space technology company Maxar said its pictures showed armoured units had fanned out through towns and forests in the area, with artillery moved into potential firing positions. In Moscow, Vladimir Putin announced 16,000 foreign “volunteers” from the Middle East were ready to fight with Russian-backed forces in eastern Ukraine to “help” the people living in the Donbas region. In a meeting with Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, Putin also said western-made weapons including Javelin and Stinger missiles that were captured by the Russian army would be handed to Donbas forces. As heavy shelling continued across eastern Ukraine’s towns and cites, Ukrainian authorities reported Russia had killed more civilians than soldiers. Russian forces were also reported to have hit a psychiatric hospital near Izyum, a town in the Kharkiv region. The regional governor, Oleh Synegubov, called it a “war crime against civilians [and] genocide against the Ukrainian nation”. He said 330 people had been in the hospital at the time, including wheelchair users and people unable to move. The exact number of casualties is still to be established. In the besieged port city of Mariupol conditions remain desperate, with people trapped inside indoor shelters with no heat, electricity and little or no food. More than 1,300 people had died in the 10-day siege, said Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk. “They [Russia] want to destroy the people of Mariupol. They want to make them starve. It’s a war crime,” she said. The Associated Press spoke to an exhausted-looking resident as he pulled a cart loaded with bags down an empty street flanked by damaged buildings in the port city. “I don’t have a home any more. That’s why I’m moving,” Aleksander Ivanov said. “It doesn’t exist any more. It was hit, by a mortar.” More than 400,000 people remain trapped in Mariupol, which is surrounded by Russian forces, and basic supplies are running out. About 200,000 are believed to want to leave amid continuous Russian bombardment but have not been able to do so despite the daily declaration of humanitarian corridors. A UN spokesperson said there were credible reports of Russians using cluster munitions in populated areas. Cluster munitions, which scatter small bombs over a large area, are banned by more than 100 countries, including the UK, but not Russia, Ukraine or the US. More than 2.5 million people have fled Ukraine and a further 2 million are internally displaced, UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, said on Friday. The grim toll for Ukrainian civilians comes amid growing fears that Russia could stage a chemical attack, as senior Russian officials recycled old conspiracy theories about alleged western-made biological weapons. The head of the Russian military’s radiation, chemical and biological protection troops, Igor Kirillov, said on Thursday that US-backed labs in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odesa were working on pathogens custom-designed to target Russians and other Slavs. According to Russian-state media, Kirillov alleged the US planned to exploit Ukraine’s “unique geographical position” by sending migratory birds carrying deadly diseases into Russia. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, made a similar claim on Thursday, alleging that US-backed labs in Ukraine were working to “develop ethnically targeted biological weapons”. The director of the CIA, William Burns, told the US Senate intelligence committee that Russia could be laying the groundwork for a chemical or biological attack, which it would then blame on the US or Ukraine in a “false flag operation”. “This is something, as all of you know very well, [that] is very much a part of Russia’s playbook,” he said. “They’ve used these weapons against their own citizens, they’ve at least encouraged the use in Syria and elsewhere, so it’s something we take very seriously.”",News/World news,Russia makes claims of US-backed biological weapon plot at UN,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/russia-un-claims-us-backed-biological-weapon-plot-kremlin-foreign-fighters-ukraine
3/12/2022,"A mother accused of murdering her five-year-old child was heard screaming: “What have you done with my son?” on the morning his body was discovered by police in a river, a jury has been told. Logan Mwangi, also known as Logan Williamson, was found in the River Ogmore close to his home in the village of Sarn, south Wales, having suffered 56 injuries to his face, head and body, Cardiff crown court has heard. His mother, Angharad Williamson, 30, his stepfather John Cole, 40, and a 14-year-old boy, who cannot legally be identified, are on trial for his murder. Paula Heath, a witness, told the jury on Friday that she was staying with her partner nearby when she was woken at about 5am on the day Logan’s body was found – 31 July 2021 – by the sound of a man and woman “bickering”. She said she heard the woman yelling: “What have you done with my son? Where is my son? I want my son.” She claimed a male voice shouted in reply: “I have done nothing with your son.” Heath told the court the woman sounded “hysterical”, adding: “The only way you could describe it was sheer panic. She was shouting: ‘Logan, Logan,’ and: ‘The back door’s open, he’s got no shoes on, he’s got no socks on.’” Later, Heath said, she saw Williamson run towards a police officer in her nightdress and bare feet and shouted: “He’s my son. You’re telling me nothing.” The jury has been told Williamson’s behaviour, including making a 999 call to police to report Logan missing, was part of a plan concocted by the three defendants to cover up their role in his death. Williamson and the youth deny committing murder and perverting the course of justice. Cole denies murder but admits perverting the course of justice. Logan’s mother claims to have put her son to bed the night before his body was found and to have woken to find him missing. Williamson’s close friend Rhiannon Hales told the court Logan was “amazing”. She said: “He had the best little smile. He was always happy and smiling – a typical mummy’s boy. He loved his mum.” Hales told the jury that Williamson and Cole had a stricter parenting style than her but she said there was “nothing to suggest anything other than a strict parent”. She said the boy was “quieter” and “less playful” around Cole, whom he called his dad.

3/12/2022,"Sixteen days after Russia invaded Ukraine, life in the capital is far from ordinary. Kyiv is a city under siege. Half of its inhabitants have left. Russian tanks and armoured vehicles are edging ever closer from the north and west, with some units just nine miles away. There are sandbags and tank traps. And yet there were tentative signs on Friday that those who remained were seeking to return to a kind of normality, even as war raged around them. In a Facebook post, Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said it was time for the country’s economy to restart. Those displaced by Russian bombing should try to find jobs, he boldly suggested. Over in Observatorna Street in central Kyiv, a 15-minute walk from the landmark St Sophia’s Cathedral, a group of Kyiv hipsters were heeding the minister’s call. City hairdressers had staged a muted reopening. There were few customers for now. The street outside was mostly deserted. And you needed an appointment. “We only take people through word of mouth at the moment,” said Yulia Stets, the salon’s lead stylist and director. The business opened in October, soon after the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, began amassing troops on Ukraine’s borders. The salon slotted right into Kyiv’s burgeoning youth scene, so hip that it was widely referred to as the “new Berlin”. Stets said she returned to work two days ago. So far they had cut the hair of seven people. Most of the staff have exited Kyiv but there were so many hairdressers without work that Stets proposed the salon become a cooperative. “We’re not getting paid,” she said. “Our last salary is all we have. People have to find a way to start working again.” Air-raid sirens go off every few hours in Kyiv. The city centre has not been hit for more than a week, when two Russian bombs struck the TV tower, killing several civilians including a journalist. Residents have grown used to the warnings. Most carry on with their daily tasks. The war, however, is never far away. A colleague of Stets went home to Kharkiv, a city which Moscow has remorselessly pounded. The employee sent Stets pictures of three dead men who had been killed when they ventured out for water. Stets and her only remaining hairdresser, Taras Savchenko, have converted one of the salon’s rooms into a storage area. It is now being used as part of Kyiv’s – and Ukraine’s – ubiquitous volunteer effort. Restaurant owners have created a network of more than 100 kitchens. They are working in shifts to deliver food to hospitals, soldiers and to other key workers. Savchenko said he had thought about cutting hair for the first time on Thursday. Previously he had collected generators from farmers and delivered them to the frontline as a volunteer driver. “After the war I want to get military training. I have none at the moment,” he said. And what about Russia? Savchenko said he wanted to kill “orcs” – a Ukrainian term for invading Kremlin soldiers – but wasn’t yet in a position to do so. Before the war he was critical of Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Now he is a fan. “What he’s doing as commander in chief is totally correct.” Non-essential shops, bars and restaurants in Kyiv have shut, along with hotels and entertainment venues. The city’s Soviet-era underground network functions as a bomb shelter. There is a train every 90 minutes. Zhennya was sitting in a stationary train in Olimpiiska station, waiting to travel to his home in Teremky, in south Kyiv. He said he came into town to buy some groceries. Usually an employee in the agri business, he said he was not working. “I have been out every day since the war began to do shopping,” explained Zhennya, who is in his mid 50s. The Park Inn hotel – a looming glass tower – and the city’s Olympic stadium were both devoid of inhabitants. But a coffee stand next to the station had miraculously reopened. Ruslan, a barista, said he went back to work on Wednesday. On Friday he said he had served 50 people – a small sign that life was carrying on. Back at the salon, a doctor working in Kyiv’s hospital number 17 came in to deliver supplies. He also brought bad news: one of his patients included a pregnant woman fleeing from Irpin, north-west of Kyiv. A Russian shell had killed her husband and she had lost her baby, Yevhen said. Two other fashionable Kyivans turned volunteers also dropped by at the salon, to pick up dog food. They were taking it to a new dog shelter. It has so far received 49 dogs – and one wolf – all apparently abandoned by owners who had fled Kyiv for western Ukraine, Poland and other destinations. When the war started, the Ukrainian government told citizens to stay at home and not go to work. But after several days of lockdown, supermarkets, petrol stations and pharmacies were told they could reopen. Many did. Now other businesses are considering starting to operate in this traumatic new normal. In his latest video address on Friday, Zelenskiy said Ukraine and its capital had survived 16 days of Russian attack – longer than Moscow and many of the Ukraine’s western supporters had anticipated. He spoke of a “strategic turning point”. He even mentioned the word “victory”. This may be wishful thinking, but whether accurate or not, the owner of Kyiv’s most famous Crimean Tatar restaurant, Musafir, said he was considering reopening on Saturday. Kemal Seitveliyev had been volunteering along with staff members. He said society needed to start functioning again even in these abnormal conditions. Musafir used to have three branches in Kyiv, but Seitveliyev said they were only using one because, as with the hair salon, his employees had mostly departed. “A few people have called me to ask if we’re open. So there is some interest. But let’s see.” He acknowledged that a reopening may be short-lived, if and when the bombs resume. “If they take Kyiv, well, that’s the end,” he said.",News/World news,‘We’re not getting paid’: the Kyiv businesses trying to reopen,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/were-not-getting-paid-the-kyiv-businesses-trying-to-reopen
3/12/2022,"The Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention once proposed that no two nations with McDonald’s franchises would go to war; people in those kinds of economies would rather queue for burgers. The thesis was not only crass, but soon disproven. Yet it nodded to a broader truth: that economic ties were drawing countries closer together, creating a global interdependence which would not quickly be undone. Times have changed. On Tuesday, the American fast-food giant suspended its operations in Russia. It is part of a dramatic exodus by international brands – from Uniqlo, Netflix and Chanel to Apple, PwC and American Express – due to Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, the western sanctions imposed in response and the public outcry. Shell and BP are selling their Russian assets. Britain and the US are banning Russian oil, while the EU is slowly phasing out gas imports, on which it is heavily dependent. On Friday, the US announced that, with allies, it was revoking Russia’s “most favoured nation” status. This huge and abrupt retrenchment is contributing to an existing economic shift of deglobalisation. The arrival of McDonald’s in Moscow in 1990 exemplified the incoming tide of global integration. Economic liberalisation in China, the Soviet Union’s collapse and the advent of new technologies created a world connected as never before – one in which it would soon seem mundane for a Russian oligarch to own an English football club; for a Chinese state firm to invest in a British nuclear plant; for American teens to dance to Korean pop on a Chinese-owned app; for identical products to be sold from Dubai to Durban and Bangkok to Buenos Aires. The economist Douglas Irwin argues that the financial crisis of 2008-09 marked the moment the process slowed, then reversed. The costs of globalisation, from the impact of shocks far away to the stunting of industrialisation in parts of Africa and low wage growth in developed nations, became increasingly evident and fostered populism. Donald Trump’s love of tariffs and trade war with China accelerated the protectionist trend. Beijing excluded US internet giants and increasingly looked towards domestic consumption and self-sufficiency in key technologies. The pandemic dramatically demonstrated the vulnerabilities in long supply chains, and made countries look closer to home. Narendra Modi announced a Self-reliant India scheme; Japan introduced incentives for companies to onshore production. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, declared that “this kind of globalisation was reaching the end of its cycle” anyway. The change should not be overstated. Most of the companies pulling out of Russia have said they are only pausing their business – though Moscow has now threatened to seize the assets of western firms exiting the country. It is doubtful that they would be so quick to quit China, where a much larger market is at stake: thousands, not hundreds, of McDonald’s branches. Concerns about human rights there are regularly brushed aside. Deglobalisation does not mean we will see a new age of autarky – the kind of drastic reversal seen in the 1920s and 30s, when protectionism surged and global trade collapsed. Even the emergence of discrete spheres of activity, cold war-style, would be a very big shift; China has boosted economic ties with Russia, but its trade with the EU and US is far greater. The pandemic demonstrated the need for international cooperation as well as national self-reliance – and if we are to tackle and adapt to global heating, technology transfer will be central. But the high tide of globalisation has passed for now; the question is how far the water will drop.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on deglobalisation: McDonald’s quits Moscow | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/11/the-guardian-view-on-deglobalisation-mcdonalds-quits-moscow
3/12/2022,"Can schools in England be said to be recovering – or starting to recover – from the impact of the pandemic? Disruption and absence due to Covid have reduced, and plans for this summer’s exams are in place, with some requirements reduced to take account of missed lessons. But the current attendance rate of about 90% at secondary schools is below the 95% which has long been Ofsted’s benchmark. There is no formal record of the number of children being home-schooled in England. Last week the country’s children’s commissioner, Dame Rachel de Souza, called for improved data. Ministers have announced plans for a compulsory register of those being taught at home, but not when this would be set up. Without school lessons, children will suffer by missing out on the curriculum to which they are entitled. The pandemic has taken a toll on mental as well as physical health, and there are concerns that schools are not equipped to provide the support that pupils are seeking. It is less than a year since the Covid recovery commissioner chosen by ministers, Sir Kevan Collins, resigned after the Treasury’s refusal to fund the £15bn schools catch-up package that he recommended. Following the much smaller increases agreed by Rishi Sunak, per-pupil spending has returned to roughly the pre-austerity level of 2009-10. Budgets for post-16 colleges are still 10% lower than they were under Labour. Earlier this month, MPs on the public accounts committee said children’s education was being eroded by financial pressures, triggering staff cuts and scaled-back curriculums, with local authority-run secondary schools among the worst hit. Young people deserve better. The government’s handling of the pandemic’s impact on schools has been error-strewn as well as ungenerous. The knighthood handed to the former education secretary Gavin Williamson was patently absurd given his appalling record. Ministers’ choice of a multinational Dutch company Randstad to deliver a £1.5bn national tutoring programme has proved a poor one. So far the business has reached just 15% of the pupils it was supposed to help, and MPs said last week that the contract should be ended if the company doesn’t “shape up” quickly. Schools are the organisations best placed to support children’s learning. Of course, oversight is important. But it is the Department for Education, rather than schools, that appears in need of challenge. Its altered national funding formula has exacerbated inequalities. Between 2017-18 and 2020-21, per-pupil funding fell by 1.2% in real terms in the 20% most deprived schools. In the least deprived 20%, it rose by 2.9%. While some academies have accumulated large reserves, MPs found, in 26 local authority areas more than 20% of schools are in deficit. Prof Lee Elliot Major of the University of Exeter has described the chaos surrounding the tutoring programme as “a battle for the futures of a whole generation”. The Education Policy Institute has pointed to stark regional differences in the long-term impact of Covid upon life-chances. The education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, has been in post for six months. He has yet to set out the government’s strategy for mitigating the harm caused by two years of disrupted learning, and for avoiding a Conservative legacy of widening educational inequalities.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on schools: it is ministers who require improvement | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/11/the-guardian-view-on-schools-it-is-ministers-who-require-improvement
3/12/2022,"EU leaders have announced their intention to collectively rearm and become autonomous in food, energy and military hardware in a Versailles declaration that described Russia’s war as “a tectonic shift in European history”. At a summit in the former royal palace, the 27 heads of state and government said on Friday that the invasion of Ukraine had shown the urgent need for the EU to take responsibility for its own security and to rid itself of dependencies on others. Speaking at a press conference in the palace’s Galerie des Batailles, in which France’s military achievements are celebrated in painting and sculpture, France’s Emmanuel Macron said the Versailles treaty of 1919 had divided Europe but that today leaders were uniting. He described Russia’s aggression as a “tragic turning point”. “We can see how our food, our energy, our defence are all issues of sovereignty,” he said. “We want to be open to the world but we want to choose our partners and not depend on anybody.” He added: “The Versailles declaration is linked to the fact that sovereignty in Europe, which might have been thought of by some as a slogan or a French fantasy, is seen by all today as crucial.” Macron defended the decision not to offer fast-track EU membership for Ukraine, which was criticised overnight by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. “The answer is no,” Macron said of the request from the war-stricken country, but he added that the EU was mobilising all its economic power to help the Ukrainian government and that the “European path” was open. Lithuania’s president, Gitanas Nausėda, said there was a “flavour of disappointment” to the decision for a number of EU member states but that the bloc would return to the issue. The Versailles declaration was said to be the “initiation” of European defence by Charles Michel, the European Council president. The leaders agreed to “invest more and better in defence capabilities and innovative technologies” by substantially increasing defence expenditures and through tighter cooperation and coordination of their armed forces and procurement. While EU member states spend more than three times the Russian defence budget, there are limited tie-ups and multiple overlaps in capabilities. The European Commission has been given a new role to find weaknesses in Europe’s defences and to advise on investment. Macron said Olaf Scholz’s decision to set aside €100bn (£84bn) for defence and Denmark’s decision to put its opt-out on EU security mechanisms to a referendum showed the seriousness of the moment. The EU is also doubling its funding of military equipment destined for Ukraine to €1bn. “About 10 days ago, Germany decided to make historical investments and Denmark made a historic choice deciding to ask the people if they want to come back to the European defence and security project,” Macron said. “Everywhere you look historic choices are being made.” A deadline of 2027 has been set for freeing the EU from dependency on Russian gas, oil and coal. In 2021, the EU imported 155bn cubic metres of natural gas from Russia, accounting for about 45% of its gas imports and close to 40% of the bloc’s total gas consumption. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said the commission would produce proposals by mid-May on how to achieve the target. In order to prepare for next winter, plans will also be made to coordinate European countries’ fragmented network of gas stocks. Von der Leyen said in future underground stocks would have to be filled to at least 90% by the start of October each year. Macron and Scholz are due to speak to Vladimir Putin in what the French president said would be a “demanding dialogue”, with the EU threatening tougher economic sanctions should Russia’s president make a move against Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. Shortly after leaders left Versailles, a new round of measures was announced by the G7, with Von der Leyen citing the failure to respect agreements over humanitarian corridors as being a motivating factor. Russia is being denied most-favoured-nation status for its markets under World Trade Organization rules, which will mean tariffs being imposed on its goods, and Moscow risks having its representatives thrown out of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. After some resistance from Italy, the EU is also banning exports of any luxury goods to Russia, “as a direct blow to the Russian elite”, Von der Leyen said. “Those who sustain Putin’s war machine should no longer be able to enjoy their lavish lifestyle while bombs fall on innocent people in Ukraine,” she added.The EU will no longer import iron and steel goods from the Russian Federation and there will be a ban on European investments across Russia’s energy sector.",News/World news,EU leaders announce intention to collectively rearm in face of Putin threat,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/eu-leaders-announce-intention-collectively-rearm-putin-threat-russia-ukraine
3/12/2022,"The national tutoring programme is to be overhauled after criticism of the catchup scheme for schools in England, with the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, promising further changes, including shifting funding towards headteachers. Zahawi said he was transferring £65m away from the NTP, including from Randstad, the Dutch service provider, to schools, in an address at the annual conference of the Association of School and College leaders. New figures from the Department for Education (DfE) showed that schools undertook the vast majority of catchup tuition under the government’s programme to help pupils recover learning opportunities lost during the pandemic. “I know that many of you have had challenges with the programme. I have listened and I have heard and we are making improvements as I speak to you today,” Zahawi said. “That includes the immediate transfer of up to £65m into school-led tutoring from the other two routes. It’s become clear to me that by far the most popular route is the one run by the schools.” Geoff Barton, ASCL general secretary, said: “It has taken far too long for the government to recognise this fact but it has got there in the end. The £65m extra funding announced today will help schools roll out the support that so many children and young people need to recover after two years of learning blighted by the pandemic.” Zahawi said it was “incredible” that 1 million tutoring courses had began since the NTP was launched in autumn 2020. The figures from the DfE showed that since September 2021 schools had started 532,000 tutoring courses, while the external tutor-led programme administered by Randstad had provided just 114,000. A further 74,000 courses had been started by school-based academic mentors funded by the government. The DfE claimed the NTP was still “on track” to meet its target of 2 million courses by the end of the year. The parts of the tutoring programme administered by Randstad have been heavily criticised for failing to meet targets in enrolling disadvantaged students, thought most likely to have lost out on learning during the pandemic. MPs on the education select committee on Friday said children in England faced “an epidemic of educational inequality” over the scheme’s failures, and said Randstad should have its DfE contract terminated unless it improved. The DfE announced further changes to the NTP, including allowing tutors recruited by Randstad to teach up to six children instead of a maximum of three in a group. The DfE also dropped a requirement that academic mentors hired under the scheme needed to be graduates, and now they need only to have A-levels. Randstad has been approached for comment. In response to the criticism by MPs on the education select committee, it said: “We have been working in partnership with the Department for Education, schools and tuition partners to look at how we can improve the programme moving forward to best serve the needs of schools.” Zahawi’s speech included insights in the white paper on schools that the government is to publish in the coming weeks. He said he wanted all schools in England to become academies and join multi-academy trusts: “I see the future as involving all schools being part of a strong trust, and I will say more about this in my white paper. “What I will say now is that I underline the word ‘strong’, because we mustn’t sugarcoat this – some trusts are not high performing. The white paper will set out how I plan to deal with that challenge as well.” On Saturday the conference is to be addressed by Amanda Spielman, the head of Ofsted, who is expected to outline her concerns about the recent increase in the number of children in England being home schooled. “We need to recognise that home education is very hard. Most parents aren’t equipped to do it and if they are motivated by their own or their child’s anxiety, rather than a deeply held desire to home-educate, the outcomes for their child are unlikely to be great,” Spielman will say.",News/Education,Zahawi to overhaul Covid catchup tutoring after criticism of provider,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/11/zahawi-to-overhaul-covid-catchup-tutoring-after-criticism-of-provider
