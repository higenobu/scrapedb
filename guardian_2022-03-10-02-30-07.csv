3/10/2022,"A Medici family chapel created by Michelangelo that was cleaned with the help of bacteria has been presented to the public to mark the 545th anniversary of the Renaissance master’s birth. Michelangelo was commissioned to sculpt the New Sacristy, in the Medici chapels in San Lorenzo church in Florence, in 1520. Restorers struggled to clean the dirt and grime that accumulated over the centuries until resorting to an unconventional solution: bacteria. The tomb is adorned with sculptures representing likenesses of two dukes from the powerful Medici family, Giuliano di Lorenzo and Lorenzo di Piero, plus four allegorical figures representing different times of the day, and the Madonna and Child. A team spent eight years restoring the delicate monument, using a bacteria-infused gel during the final stage of the project to remove the most stubborn dirt marks. Scientists tested 11 strains of bacteria on marble before it was decided that three non-toxic varieties – Serratia ficaria SH7, Pseudomonas stutzeri CONC11 and Rhodococcus sp. ZONT – would be the most effective for Michelangelo’s masterpiece. Serratia ficaria, a bacterium that causes urinary tract infections, managed to remove dirt from the tomb in two days. Part of the sarcophagus was in a particularly bad state as the remains of Alessandro Medici, a ruler of Florence who was assassinated, had been buried in the tomb without being eviscerated, as was customary at the time for Medici family members. This meant that over time the organic liquids from the corpse had started to seep through and stain Michelangelo’s work. The restoration was completed last year and the cleaned-up tomb was presented to the public in an event hosted by the Academy of the Arts of Drawing. Monica Bietti, an art historian and former chief of the Medici chapels museum, who led the restoration project, said: “The restoration of one of the most symbolic places of art required knowledge, experience and science combined with the qualities of sensitivity and intelligence. For this reason, the work was tested from the start and then subjected to constant optical, methodological and scientific checks.”",News/World news,Florence tomb by Michelangelo restored with aid of bacteria,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/florence-tomb-by-michelangelo-restored-with-aid-of-bacteria
3/10/2022,"This has been quite the spell for those who like to number crunch around the world of professional golf. The Players Championship, taking place this weekend, carries a prize purse of $20m with $3.6m to be bestowed on the winner. By Sunday evening, three tournaments in a row played in Florida will have seen $40m handed out on the basis of leaderboard placings. Arnold Palmer’s PGA Tour winnings totalled $1.9m. Those at the summit of this sport have never had it so good. Still, many believe the largesse associated with the PGA Tour in particular has become obscene, to the point where golfers will naturally lose all grip on reality. The theory was only endorsed as umpteen players at least flirted with Saudi Arabia and its bid for a breakaway tour. Phil Mickelson, without any apparent irony, blasted the PGA Tour for “obnoxious greed” before admitting his Saudi dealings were all about “leverage”. The Saudi scheme actually made little commercial sense – which perhaps doesn’t matter when you are seeking to rebrand a kingdom – but the willingness of sportsmen to indulge it on the basis of guaranteed tens of millions has been an inauspicious sight. The PGA and DP World Tours viewed the disruption plan as serious enough to not only close ranks but to beef up their financial offering. Yet again, the players win. But are golfers now paid too much? “We are paid as much as people are willing to pay us, I guess,” says Rory McIlroy. “You can say the same thing about footballers or any other athletes. You could argue that they’re paid too little or too much, but you’re only worth what people are willing to pay you. “I’d say at this point we’re fairly paid. The top guys earn a lot of money, and I think that’s right. Even the guys that are not at the top, they still earn a really, really good living. I think it’s a good structure.” McIlroy is one of umpteen players who collect small fortunes via off-course endorsements and private business interests. Palmer did likewise. Although a conflicting viewpoint is not publicly available – do not bite the hand etc – it does exist. Aaron Rodgers denied a report that he has agreed a four-year contract worth $200m but the figure was easy to believe. In the context of golf, Tiger Woods has earned slightly more than $120m across his career from the PGA Tour, $25m more than Mickelson. McIlroy’s PGA Tour career winnings are $60m. Golfers do genuinely look at the guaranteed salaries of US team sports stars and wonder if their deal is a poor one. The difference, of course, lies in exposure: Woods would be recognised in any city, which cannot legitimately be said about most golfers in the world’s Top 20. “When I turned pro, if you turned to me and said you’d give me all my expenses and pay my mortgage plus the average wage on top of that, I would have had a great life,” says Pádraig Harrington. “It has changed so much but we don’t have control of that. A lot of the Irish professionals before me had to get jobs when they finished on tour. “A lot of it is relative. Winning £1,000 in the 1960s could buy you a house. Winning $2m won’t get you much in Florida. I don’t begrudge the guys who have the prize money going up. Careers don’t last long. There is not a simple answer to the question; there is no way you can say we don’t get paid too much but that’s what the market dictates. At the very top it looks astronomical but look at football.” Harrington rightly points out that the costs associated with playing a full schedule in Europe means one may not need to go particularly far down the DP World Tour’s money list to find players who aren’t enjoying a lavish lifestyle. It is fitting, of course, that Woods will be inducted into golf’s Hall of Fame in a week where the sport’s class of 2022 scrap over a record prize fund at Sawgrass. Largely through increased television interest, Woods single-handedly drove up his sport’s value. “He made professional golf at the highest level a very, very attractive thing to be involved in,” adds McIlroy of Woods. “TV paid more. Sponsors paid more. And then all of a sudden, his peers and colleagues and other players were getting paid more because of that. I think we all have to be very thankful for Tiger Woods.”",Sport/Sport,Most lucrative Players Championship yet highlights growth of golf’s riches,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/09/most-lucrative-players-championship-yet-highlights-growth-of-golfs-riches
3/10/2022,"Maria Friedman has staged several solo cabaret shows but this one, dedicated to Stephen Sondheim, Marvin Hamlisch and Michel Legrand, is a collaborative affair, with several parts and many singers. Bouncing on stage, a glamorous fizz of energy, Friedman kicks off her silver stilettos and pads around in stockinged feet, inhabiting every song. Her voice is crystalline, quivering, silky, deep or high, as the song requires it; it is filled with all the hope and youth of a wannabe in Broadway Baby and driven by mournful knowing in Losing My Mind. She sounds all the more glorious in this intimate space, the stage lit up by bulbs that give it the look of a theatrical jazz club (lighting design by Paul Pyant, with superb musical accompaniment by pianist Theo Jamieson, double bassist Paul Moylan and drummer Joe Evans). Under the direction of David Babani, this is a show that oozes love for performance. The big dramatic moments that come through the songs are sometimes accompanied by cute vignettes about Friedman’s friendships, and working relationships, with the three composers. But the bigger conceit of this show is to not merely look back but find a future for their legacies. So there is a choir from the Royal Academy of Music and two prominent young singers plucked out: the ebullient Indonesian-born Desmonda Cathabel and 19-year-old Alfie Friedman. His status as Maria’s son slightly undercuts the sense of democratic discovery being showcased on stage, although it does not take away from his astonishing talent – his singing is one of the biggest highlights. There are solos and group numbers, the latter coming together gorgeously in Hamlisch’s I Hope I Get It and in Legrand’s The Windmills of Your Mind. But the various elements make for a mixed bag of a show: partly a look back to three extraordinary legacies, with Sondheim at the centre, and also something of a “Maria Friedman show”, with stories about her life, family, struggles and career highs. This is charming but sometimes cheesy in its self-celebratory tone: we are told about the time she was called up by Hamlisch who was struck by hearing her voice on the radio, with Hamlisch’s widow, Terre, appearing on stage to retell the story. Friedman sits with singers Ian McLarnon and Matthew White, who perform throughout the show, and speaks of how they met, had kids, and came back together again. It is all forgivably self-indulgent but draws the evening into becoming a long, slightly flabby affair. It is clear that Friedman has an indefatigable passion for song. She will go on performing until she drops, she says, and there is, in the numerous finales at the end, a sense that she could simply go on telling stories and entertaining us, in an all-night cabaret lock-in, given half the chance.

3/10/2022,"What were they really like? In a biography of an artist, answering that question can be either an overt mission or a rumbling subtext. The Andy Warhol Diaries (Netflix), Andrew Rossi’s exhaustive six-parter based on Warhol’s own journal, chooses the former to an occasionally startling degree, but the work has already been chewed up and spat out a million times. Here is a long look at why a fallible human made it. The show is based on Warhol’s own words, spoken to and transcribed by his friend Pat Hackett on a daily basis between 1976 and Warhol’s death in 1987, then published as a 1,200-page brick of intrigue in 1989. Episode one begins with an instruction to us not to take Warhol’s version of events on trust, which the programme precludes in any case via its rounded roster of contributors: as well as Warhol museum curators, other artists and simpatico cultural figures like Jerry Hall and John Waters, we hear from Warhol’s professional confidants and the loved ones of those closest to him. A man who strove to be unknowable becomes, partly by his own hand but mainly via the observations of others, known.The picture constructed is an intensified version of an old story: that of the artist as an interested alien, a spectator who envies the players while better understanding the game. Andrew Warhola, the son of Austro-Hungarian immigrants from a poor part of conservative Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, relocates to New York and reinvents himself as both the boss of the Factory, a queer sanctuary at the avant garde end of the 1960s Manhattan art scene, and a wildly popular interpreter of commerce and celebrity’s vulgar iconographies. He is an outsider who craves mainstream acceptance, but whose art relies on standing outside it to see it clearly; a god of the underground art world whose obsession with the surfaces of celebrity puts him at constant risk of being dismissed as superficial.The central point made by The Andy Warhol Diaries is the extent to which these tensions are created by Warhol’s sexuality, religion and self-image. As a gay Catholic who hates his own hair, skin and features – “I’m just a freak. I can’t change it. I’m too unusual” – he is revealed here as brittle and insecure in a personal life defined by three key relationships: the series gives over a whole episode each to Warhol’s lovers, Jed Johnson and Jon Gould, and to his friend and collaborator Jean-Michel Basquiat.The Johnson story is the most rewarding, beginning in 1967 when he delivers a package to the building that is about to become the second iteration of the Factory and, deemed too handsome to work as a courier, is hired on the spot. His subsequent relationship with Warhol lasts for 12 years and has the classic contours of a doomed love between a volatile creative and the gentle companion who grounds them: as Warhol questions his own relevance in the 70s, Johnson flourishes as an interior designer with an eye for elegant luxury and access to famous clients. Eventually Johnson leaves his famous partner when Warhol’s interest in hardcore sex films and Studio 54 excess become unbearable. Warhol almost immediately transfers his affection to Gould, a strapping, preppy, sweater-round-the-neck movie executive whose posh New England background and ability to pass for straight make him an avatar for many of the things Warhol craves. Clearly Gould’s importance to Warhol runs deeper than this and their love is real, but the contributor who can offer intimate insights about the relationship and its influence on Warhol’s work apparently does not exist. At this point, the show’s long running time and diligent treatment of the men in Warhol’s life as subjects in their own right start to feel indulgent.There’s no such problem with the instalment on Basquiat, the emerging genius whose joint canvases with Warhol revitalise the older man’s creativity in the early 80s. Their flirty symbiosis, where who’s piggybacking on whose reputation – if indeed anyone is – remains disputed, raises hard questions about whether Warhol’s affinity with people of colour, both as fellow artists and subjects of his work, veers into exploitation. But the appreciation of their joint art is thrilling, bolstered by archive footage that is dreamily evocative of a century that feels inescapably more decadent, glamorous and ripe with potential than our own. The last episode delivers an illuminating, heartfelt reappraisal of Warhol’s maligned final paintings, seeing them as his response to the Aids epidemic. Having lost Gould to Aids, Warhol is painfully invested in the calamity, not at all the disinterested voyeur suggested by his public facade. That was a false impression all along: this series shows that for Warhol, it was always personal.",Arts/Television & radio,The Andy Warhol Diaries review – a startling biopic told with the artist’s own words,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/09/the-andy-warhol-diaries-review-a-startling-biopic-told-with-the-artists-own-words
3/10/2022,"Households are facing the prospect of even higher food prices owing to the war in Ukraine, threatening hikes of the kind seen in 2008 after the global financial crisis, as wheat exports from Ukraine and Russia come under threat, compounding price increases resulting from the climate crisis. Prices of wheat, maize and soya beans have surpassed 2008 levels in recent days, with maize hovering slightly below prices of 2013 and soya beans reaching similar heights as in 2012. Arif Husain, the chief economist at the UN World Food Programme (WFP), said: “The devastating consequences of the Russian onslaught on Ukraine are also felt in places far away. Grain and oil prices are fast approaching or even surpassing levels not seen since the 2008 food and fuel crisis.” Food prices were surging around the world before the invasion, in part because of the effects of the climate crisis and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), a UN agency, has said Ukrainian farmers could miss the crucial May planting season for their crops. Supplies from Russia could also come under threat if the Kremlin curtails wheat exports in response to western sanctions. Ukraine is the fifth largest wheat exporter, accounting for about 10% of the global market, according to the FAO. It is also one of the biggest exporters of maize, accounting for about 15% of global exports. Russia is the world’s largest wheat exporter, with about 17% share of the global export market, and is the second biggest supplier of sunflower seed. The Black Sea region exports at least 12% of global food calories, including sunflower oil, maize and other crops along with wheat. A large proportion of these exports – about 40% in the case of wheat – go to the Middle East and Africa, where food price rises are already biting. Gilbert Houngbo, the president of the International Fund for Agricultural Development, said: “We are very concerned that an extended conflict in Ukraine could limit the world’s supply of staple crops like wheat, corn and sunflower oil, resulting in the skyrocketing of food prices and hunger. This could jeopardise global food security and heighten geopolitical tensions. “The continuation of this conflict, already a tragedy for those directly involved, will be catastrophic for the entire world, and particularly those that are already struggling to feed their families.” One in 10 people in the world already lack enough food to eat, and coronavirus has exacerbated the problem as pandemic has disrupted markets and food transportation networks in developing countries, as well as worsening poverty. What makes this crisis even worse is that the effects of climate breakdown have already created global disruption in key food markets. Prices for durum wheat, used to make pasta, soared by 90% late last year after widespread drought and record heatwaves in Canada, one of the world’s biggest grain producers. Key growing areas in the US experienced wildfires and extreme weather last year, while there was drought in areas of Latin America. Australia is suffering from devastating floods, the impacts of which have yet to be fully felt on its agricultural exports. This it on top of problems with poor weather last year. In the UK, food prices have been affected by Brexit, which has increased costs because of the extra bureaucracy involved in shipping. In some of the world’s most vulnerable regions, people were already facing acute food shortages owing to weather conditions of the type that have been found to be worsening as a result of the climate crisis. Drought is already afflicting the Horn of Africa, threatening famine there. Three consecutive failed rainy seasons have decimated crops and caused abnormally high livestock deaths. Shortages of water and pasture are forcing families from their homes and leading to increased conflict between communities. Forecasts suggest the below-average rainfall will worsen, compounding already dire conditions in the coming months. Michael Dunford, the WFP’s regional director for eastern Africa, said: “Harvests are ruined, livestock are dying, and hunger is growing as recurrent droughts affect the Horn of Africa. The situation requires immediate humanitarian action and consistent support to build the resilience of communities for the future.”",News/Global development,Ukraine war piles pressure on global food system already in crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/mar/09/ukraine-war-piles-pressure-on-global-food-system-already-in-crisis
3/10/2022,"Venezuela has released two jailed Americans as the two countries seek to improve relations amid an energy crisis caused by Russia’s war in Ukraine. Gustavo Cárdenas, an executive with US oil refining company Citgo was released on Tuesday night, along with Jorge Fernández, who was arrested last year on terrorism charges the White House described as “spurious”. “These men are fathers who lost precious time with their children and everyone they love, and their families have suffered every day of their absence,” Joe Biden said in a statement. Despite boasting the world’s largest proven oil reserves, Venezuela is mired in political, economic and social crises, with shortages in food and fuel widespread. President Nicolás Maduro has brutally clamped down on dissent, arresting and torturing protesters and perceived enemies, and has been accused of rigging a string of elections. The US broke diplomatic ties with Maduro’s government in 2019, recognising the opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the South American country’s legitimate president, while levelling sanctions on Venezuela and its state-controlled oil sector. But over the weekend White House representatives visited Caracas for talks – the first trip of its kind in over 20 years – in an apparent attempt to pull Venezuela away from Russia after the invasion of Ukraine. The release of the two Americans on Tuesday night came hours after Maduro appeared to indicate interest in improving relations with the US, hinting that he was willing to resume negotiations with the opposition. Cárdenas, along with five other Citgo executives – known as the Citgo Six – had been detained since 2017, after being lured to Caracas for a meeting at the offices of PDVSA, Venezuela’s state owned oil company of which Citgo is a subsidiary. The other five remain detained. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, confirmed that Cárdenas and Fernández were back in the US. Observers say that the energy crisis caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has led both the White House and Maduro to cautiously pursue a better relationship. “Yesterday’s release is welcome news, as is the decision by the Biden administration to engage directly with President Maduro, despite having no formal diplomatic relations for the past three years,” said Phil Gunson, a Venezuela analyst at the International Crisis Group, a thinktank. “It is clear that the trigger for this renewed engagement is the energy crisis faced by the US and its allies, now driven primarily by the war in Ukraine and the move to ban imports of Russian oil and gas. “As Washington seeks a deal with Maduro involving sanctions relief in exchange for alleviating the oil shock,” Gunson went on to say, “it will rightly be under pressure not to leave out of the equation the need for progress in restoring institutional rule in Venezuela and resolving the political and humanitarian crisis.”",News/World news,Venezuela releases two Americans in effort to improve relations amid energy crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/venezuela-releases-two-americans-energy-crisis
3/10/2022,"The Catholic church has banned a visit to a London school by a gay author and removed a number of governors who supported the event, in a move that has drawn comparisons to the notorious 1980s section 28 ban on “promoting homosexuality”. The church said a visit by Simon James Green, an acclaimed author of books for children and young adults, fell “outside the scope of what is permissible in a Catholic school”. Green had been due to speak and sign books on Monday at John Fisher boys’ school in Purley, south London, a voluntary-aided faith school overseen by the Catholic archdiocese of Southwark. A second event at another school, St John’s primary in Gravesend, scheduled for Wednesday, was also cancelled. Green told the Guardian that he “didn’t think this sort of thing could happen in the UK today. I was at school when section 28 was in force. So I know full well the horror of living under that legislation. But it was repealed in 2003. So I didn’t think a school today would go down that route.” Section 28, which prohibited local authorities from “promoting homosexuality”, was introduced by Margaret Thatcher’s government in response to a children’s book, Jenny Lives With Eric and Martin, depicting different kinds of families. In a statement issued a few days before the John Fisher event, the archdiocese said its schools were required to “deliver a programme of relationships and sex education that is compliant with the Equalities Act 2010 and Magisterium [teaching] of the Catholic church”. It added: “From time to time, materials or events emerge for consideration that fall outside the scope of what is permissible in a Catholic school … In such circumstances, we have no alternative but to affirm our unequivocal and well-known theological and moral precepts and to act in accordance with them.” However, the school’s leadership team, backed by its governors, voted to go ahead with Green’s visit. The archdiocese then cancelled the event and removed a number of governors. The school’s chaplain, Father James Clark, emailed parents to say the proposed event had “caused scandal in the local area and has brought our international reputation into doubt”. The email, seen by the Guardian, added: “The headteacher and some governors have decided to disobey the clear instruction from the diocese and this will have serious consequences in the weeks ahead,” and saying that the school “had no choice but to make a stand against tyranny and to defend truth”. Catholic Truth, a Catholic website, also campaigned against the event, saying: “Catholic schools cannot, under any circumstance, endanger the faith of pupils in their charge by presenting as a good, something which is condemned by the divinely bequeathed teaching authority of Christ’s church.” One parent told the Guardian: “A lot of us are shocked at the intolerant language being used. It sends a terrible message to the children. Who would want to come and teach here or send their children here after this?” The NEU and NASUWT teaching unions at the school passed a motion saying they believed the archdiocese’s decision violated the UN convention on the rights of the child. Members were “concerned about the mental and emotional impact these events have had on our LGBTQ+ community and wider inclusive John Fisher school family, including staff, students and parents”. A spokesperson for the NEU said the cancellation of the event and the decision to remove some school governors was “a matter of grave concern”. The union would be writing to the archdiocese “calling for the reinstatement of both the governing body members and for the visit by Simon James Green to be allowed to go ahead”. Green said his response to the church’s actions was disbelief. “There was initial shock and dismay and hurt, but after that it was the students I felt most worried for. I know what it’s like to be a teenager at school, questioning yourself, and how vulnerable that can make you.” His books for young adults were novels featuring LGBT characters, with some “soft romance” but nothing explicit, he said. His books for younger readers celebrated underdogs but contained nothing about LGBT issues. Green said he hoped the school events could be rescheduled. He decided to speak out “because if you don’t, there can be creeping sense of people feeling emboldened in the future, and things getting worse”. Stephen Evans of the National Secular Society said: “The disturbing behaviour of this diocese highlights a broader problem of faith schools stigmatising same-sex relationships and therefore contributing to a climate where many young LGBT people are growing up feeling ashamed or frightened about who they are. “Our own research has shown that a significant number of faith schools promote the idea that same-sex attraction is ‘morally wrong’, ‘disordered’ or a ‘lifestyle choice’. This isn’t acceptable in a publicly funded school.” Robert Cann of Humanists UK said the archdiocese was “discriminating against a well-regarded children’s author, whose work has been celebrated far and wide, simply because his work promotes LGBT acceptance. The result is that children, including LGBT children, are missing out on learning that LGBT people should be celebrated, and their relationships should be respected just like those of straight people. “Dioceses should not have the power to block lessons that promote inclusion under the Equality Act, and they should not be able to sack governors who support such lessons.” The archdiocese of Southwark and John Fisher school have been contacted for comment.",Arts/Books,Catholic church bans visit by gay author to London school,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/09/catholic-church-bans-visit-by-gay-author-to-london-school

3/10/2022,"A nightclub infamous for its sticky carpet has sold dozens of souvenir chunks of the fabric after a joke suggestion became a reality. The Acapulco has been a fixture of Halifax nightlife for decades and thousands of clubgoers have become attached to its garishly patterned carpet. The club, which claims to be the oldest in Britain, opened in 1961 and laid the colourful floor covering – which quickly become a local fixture itself – in 2003. Simon Jackson, the owner of the “the Acca” as it is widely known in West Yorkshire, said his carpet had been unfairly maligned but insisted its reputation could be used for good. The idea to sell it off started as a “tongue-in-cheek joke” between friends but quickly “snowballed” as word got out, he said. Within an hour on Wednesday afternoon, the club had sold more than 100 pieces of its carpet. “It’s gone really, really mental,” said Jackson. “We thought we would be chucking most of it but we’ve had to pull some bits out of the skip, if I’m honest. It’s going great guns.” For only £5, customers can own an A4-sized slice of the 19-year-old fabric. Big spenders can take home a framed and engraved piece for £50. Buyers can even order a piece of carpet from a specific place in the club, including outside the toilet, below the bar or the well-worn fray at the edge of the dancefloor. Proceeds from the sale will go to the local Street Angels charity, which carries out night-time patrols in Halifax to check on the welfare of drinkers. Jackson, 55, said he had been inundated with emails from patrons who have a special connection to a specific part of the Acca. One person got in touch to say they had scattered their grandmother’s ashes in the club, he said, while others have pointed to the exact spot where they first met their partner. “It’s got some history there,” he said. “It is the oldest club in the country and it’s probably the oldest carpet in the country. The carpet is probably older than some of our customers.” The Acca has enjoyed a loyal fanbase in West Yorkshire for decades, remaining popular when competition from superclubs, festivals and cheap foreign holidays have seen hundreds of other nightclubs go to the wall. While many are no doubt drawn to its special offers – 75p drinks before 11pm and free entry for the first 200 revellers – its popularity is also due to its place in local history. Jackson, who first worked at the club in the 1980s and became its owner in 1995, said he hoped the carpet sale would raise £3,000 for charity and put a spring in people’s step: “I suppose with the rest of the news going on it will just make people smile.”",News/Business,Infamous sticky carpet sold off in chunks as nightclub has a revamp ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/09/halifax-acapulco-nightclub-sells-famous-carpet-charity

3/10/2022,"A newly discovered fossilized vampire squid has been named after the US president, Joe Biden, a team of paleontologists has announced. The Syllipsimopodi bideni, which has been described as an “incredibly rare” fossil, was first dug up in Montana and then donated to the Royal Museum in Canada in 1988. However, it proceeded to sit untouched in a drawer for decades until a scientist pulled it out for a closer look. Speaking to the New York Times, Christopher Whalen, a paleontologist from New York’s American Museum of Natural History said he first noticed the squid’s preserved arms and saw small suckers in the rock. “This was sitting in a museum since the 80s and no one realized it was important,” said Whalen. “We chanced on that importance because I happened to notice the arm suckers.” The Syllipsimopodi bideni drifted across oceans nearly 328m years ago. According to Whalen, it is the oldest known ancestor of vampyropods, a group that includes vampire squids and octopuses. The fossil’s first name translates roughly to “prehensile foot”, since it has 10 arms and is the oldest known cephalopod to have suckers on each of its arms. Modern vampire squids, which are not squids but close relatives to the octopus, have eight arms and two stringy filaments. According to the paper, the fossil even appeared to contain a preserved ink sac. Whalen, along with Neil Landman, a curator emeritus at the American Museum of Natural History, described the new species in the journal Nature Communications on Tuesday. Their decision to name the squid after Biden came as they were “encouraged by his plans to address climate change and to fund scientific research”, Whalen said in an email to the New York Times. The Syllipsimopodi bideni is not the first species to be named after a president. Nine species were named after Barack Obama, including a spider, a hairworm and several fish. A moth and a blind worm-like amphibian that buries its head in the sand were named after Donald Trump.",News/Science,Joe Biden is a fossil: 328m-year-old vampire squid named after president,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/09/joe-biden-fossil-name-vampire-squid
3/10/2022,"Iarrived on the same day as Maria. She was shy, withdrawn and reminded me of a fragile bird as she leaned over her hot drink to keep warm. We would talk in the garden, the only place to find any peace, and fantasise about eating lasagne and drinking red wine. We were in prison. I was on remand awaiting trial. I had been arrested while suffering a psychotic episode – I would be there for six months until the hospital order arrived from the court. It felt like six years. Everyone had a sad story: domestic abuse, childhood trauma, homelessness. One woman, after losing her son, set herself on fire. Another, also charged with arson, set her house on fire during a psychotic episode. One had attempted suicide with her child in tow. I felt like the odd one out. I had a wonderful childhood; I hadn’t experienced anything traumatic and had never been homeless. But there is no stereotypical prisoner – you can end up in prison regardless of your background. What I did share with the others was that I was severely mentally unwell. I was on the mental health wing, but there are plenty of ill people on the main wings of prisons too. A recent report from the Centre of Mental Health commissioned by NHS England found that 45% of adults in prison have anxiety or depression, 8% have a diagnosis of psychosis, and 60% have experienced a traumatic brain injury. Is prison really the best place for people who are mentally unwell? It is difficult to capture just how claustrophobic a prison cell is. “Lock-up!” an officer would bellow, and we would all rush to our cells. There it was just me, my thoughts and four walls. It was impossible to sleep, with the screaming and shouting of other prisoners. Sometimes, when there were staff shortages, we were locked up for 24 hours a day. I have no doubt that the dehumanising nature of being locked away for most of the day made my mental illness – later diagnosed as bipolar disorder – worse in every possible way. I saw a psychiatrist who started me on anti-psychotic medication, but the delusions that had landed me in prison for arson in the first place grew stronger. I never turned on the television in my cell because my illness made me think the newsreaders were speaking to me. I was too scared to eat anything in case someone had drugged my food. It is easy to fall into despair in such a situation. I felt suicidal. Two girls on my wing tried to kill themselves while I was there. They were found by staff in time, but many others are not. In the 12 months to March 2021, there were 79 suicides in prisons in the UK. The report by the Centre of Mental Health, which used research from the Offender Health Research Network, states that of the 285 self-inflicted deaths occurring in English and Welsh prisons between 2016-2018, 63% of victims had a mental health diagnosis recorded, and 67% had their reception screening carried out by a nurse without mental health qualifications. Self-harm was rife. My mood grew so low that I self-harmed for the first time. According to government data, there were 55,542 self-harm incidents in prisons in the 12 months to December 2020, with rates especially high among women prisoners. The only thing that made me feel any better was reading. I would read and reread Man’s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl, highlighting the words “he who has a why to live for can bear almost any how”. Whether it was Frankl, Donna Tartt or Ian McEwan, books transported me away from my surroundings for a short while. One of the prison officers would bring me books, and chatted to me when I was feeling down. When he was on shift, my mood lifted. When I found out that the only way to get out of your cell during the day was to work, I did all I could to get a job in the prison library. Prisoners feel worthless and hopeless, with little to provide comfort and intellectual stimulation. Books fill this gap. Some prisoners would come in for a crime series, or looked for prison diaries – perhaps to find out how others had survived. Others would lose themselves in a fantasy series such as Harry Potter or Twilight. I remember one prisoner animatedly telling me about all the different books she had read while in prison. She was extremely well-read, and I presumed she had brought this love of reading from her life outside. In fact, she had never read a single book before entering prison. This is common. Almost one third of adult prisoners assessed by the Ministry of Justice are below the reading level expected of an 11-year-old. According to the Shannon Trust, which helps rehabilitate prisoners by using inmates who can read to teach those who can’t, 50% of UK prisoners are functionally illiterate. Of the women remanded by magistrates in the UK in 2019, 60% did not ultimately receive a custodial sentence. According to the Centre of Mental Health, this can often do more harm than good as coming to prison, especially on a short sentence, as I did, creates a huge disruption to the life of people who are already extremely vulnerable and unwell. Being on remand is not the answer to an acute episode of mental illness. It is inhumane and impractical to lock someone up who is floridly psychotic; the solutions lie in a better-resourced mental health system that treats the unwell person rather than locking them away. Out of sight, the problem is still there: an acutely unwell individual in need of the right treatment and support. Maria and I are both out now. I hope she is eating lasagne and drinking red wine. I hope she is free. I hope all the prisoners I met are now receiving the support they need instead of being locked in a cell surrounded by others who also don’t deserve to be there. I hope.

3/10/2022,"Scientific evidence of sharks sleeping has been documented in Australia for the first time. A team of scientists has observed sleep in draughtsboard sharks, a bottom-dwelling species endemic to Australia, by analysing the animals’ metabolism and posture. The study’s lead author, Dr Michael Kelly of La Trobe University, said there was previously anecdotal evidence of sleep in sharks, mostly from observations by scuba divers. “From a scientific standpoint, quantitatively, this had never been looked at,” he said. The team monitored seven draughtsboard sharks over a 24-hour period, and found that the sharks’ metabolism – as measured through oxygen consumption – dropped during periods of inactivity longer than five minutes. “We know that a drop in metabolism is a telltale sign of sleep in many, many other animals,” Kelly said. When the sharks were inactive for five minutes or longer, the animals’ metabolic rates dropped lower than when they were when awake but resting, or actively swimming. In addition, the animals also changed their body posture to lying flat while sleeping. Draughtsboard sharks are ambush predators. When awake but inactive, the sharks stick out their pectoral fins and sit with their heads up, Kelly said. The sharks sometimes slept with their eyes shut, but the researchers noted this happened more often during the day. They surmise the shut-eye was associated with light levels rather than sleep. Kelly’s previous work has investigated behavioural indicators of sleep in the sharks, such as a rousing threshold. “When these animals are inactive for five minutes or longer, it takes a higher amount of stimulation to elicit a reaction from them,” he said. Behavioural indicators of sleep are not considered definitive, as it’s difficult for researchers to tell whether an animal is truly asleep or merely playing dead or in quiet wakefulness. Draughtsboard sharks are a species of buccal pumping sharks, which manually push water over their gills so they can respire even while still. Obligate ram ventilators, on the other hand – which includes great whites and tiger sharks – must keep swimming to ventilate their gills, and die from a lack of oxygen if they stop. “The idea was … those animals aren’t sleeping because they move continuously,” Kelly said, adding the theory had been debunked in other animals. “Staying still is not a criteria for sleep. We see that in marine mammals – whales and dolphins are able to keep swimming and sleep … We know that birds are able to keep flying and sleep.” Kelly plans to monitor brain activity in draughtsboard sharks, and says further research on sleep in ram ventilators is needed. The study was published in the journal Biology Letters.",News/Environment,Sleeping with fishes: Australian scientists discover some sharks do need their shut-eye ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/10/sleeping-with-fishes-australian-scientists-discover-some-sharks-do-need-their-shut-eye
3/10/2022,"Thousands of victims of the floods in NSW and Queensland will be unable to claim on their insurance due to exclusions in policy fine print, the Financial Rights Law Centre says. What is covered by insurance policies varies wildly between insurers because definitions of events including flood, rainwater runoff and wind damage are not standard, the group said in a new report. “There are going to be a lot of people who think they’re covered,” Drew MacRae, a policy officer at FLRC, said. But many will find they are not covered because the fine print excludes particular types of damage, MacRae said. He said this even applied to flood damage, which was given a standard definition after floods in Queensland in 2011, when the Brisbane River broke its banks and inundated low-lying Brisbane suburbs as well as regional centres. One insurer, NRMA, has included rainwater runoff in its definition of flooding, the FLRC report said. Residents “may have opted out of flood but have coverage for storm or rain,” MacRae said. “But if you couldn’t afford flood insurance, you may not be covered for rainwater runoff,” he said. In its report, Standardising General Insurance Definitions, FLRC found 65% of the insurers it examined considered flood and storm to be separate events but the rest lumped them in together. Some insurers also included wind, hail, rain and cyclone under the definition of storm but others did not. One insurer, RACV, also allows itself to remove flooding, rainwater runoff and storm surge damage from a policy if it deems a property at risk of these events, FLRC said. The research found that more than 75% of policies excluded damage to retaining walls, 25% excluded damage to bridges and 62% excluded damage to driveways or gravel paths. The majority of insurers (62%) excluded damage from “actions of the sea”, such as tidal surges, with only one, Defence, explicitly including it in their policies. Three insurers – NRMA, RACV and SGIC – said they would only pay for soil movement damage if it happened immediately as a result of the storm or rainwater runoff. The Insurance Council of Australia said 107,844 claims have been lodged over the floods in NSW and south-east Queensland, estimated to be worth $1.62bn. MacRae said the lack of standardisation also affected fire policies – something people discovered after the 2019-2020 bushfires ripped through large swathes of eastern Victoria and southern NSW. “In the black summer, some people were covered and some were not,” he said. “It comes down to whether it was fire with a flame, was it a bushfire? Sometimes they don’t cover smoke damage, sometimes they don’t cover heat damage.” He said terms needed standardising so that policyholders could use the new Consumer Data Right (CDR), which allows consumers to share their data with providers. “The CDR is there to help people switch, to get better deals,” he said. “The lack of standardisation makes it very difficult to do that.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He said the problem had been obvious for years. “The industry will say we need innovation and competition but what is the point of innovation that means people aren’t covered for basics? “It really is another way of reducing costs.” The government committed to standardising insurance on the recommendation of a Senate inquiry in 2017 and began a consultation process in 2018. But progress stalled because treasury was focused on the banking royal commission, which kicked off in 2018, and its recommendations, which commissioner Kenneth Hayne handed to government in February 2019. “They still have not gone back to the work of standardising the definitions,” MacRae said.",News/Australia news,"Insurance fine print may mean thousands of flood victims are unable to claim, report says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/10/insurance-fine-print-may-mean-thousands-of-flood-victims-are-unable-to-claim-report-says
3/10/2022,"How can I help my child worry less about all that’s happening in the world? In the last two-odd years, children in Australia have witnessed devastating bushfires, been locked down in their homes due to a pandemic, and more recently, seen parts of their country ravaged by floods as a war unfolded on the other side of the world. All of this has been quite hard to stomach even for the thick-skinned adults, so it’s no wonder that parents are concerned about the emotional toll the negative news cycle might be having on their children. Prof Lea Waters, a psychologist and researcher at the University of Melbourne, says parents can help their kids deal with this by talking to them about what’s taking place – be it war, the devastating impacts of climate change or pandemics – and be guided by their age and their personalities when it comes to discussing such world events. “You would talk to teens in more detail than you would talk to younger kids,” she says. While past parenting trends might have favoured a well-meaning “don’t tell” approach as the means of protecting kids, it’s a method that isn’t necessarily ideal right now, Waters says. “Kids are smart, they’ve got social media and their friends talk [about such news], so all you’re actually doing [by not discussing] is preventing your child from emotionally processing. “The psychology research shows that the way to protect them is to talk to them in an age-appropriate way that’s informing, but not overwhelming.” For Waters, this means carefully addressing their present and future state of mind in response to the bad news cycle. “I think that a lot of kids would be feeling that the world is falling down around them and all these big things are happening that they can’t control,” she says. “The emotional response is going to be fear and anxiety – fear is the emotion of ‘I’m unsafe right now’, and anxiety is more future-oriented, [a fear] that something bad is going to happen in the future.” Waters says in the past two years, the pattern of anxiety has been consistent. She recommends using everyday moments and conversations as a way to reassure children about their future and wellbeing. “The fear is in the present moment, so it’s about saying ‘I know it’s hard to see what’s happening in the world’, but reassuring them of their own safety right now,” she says. In her view, this can be done with practical steps such as showing children that their residential block, for instance, is fireproof, or telling them that they are not in a flood zone. The conversation about overcoming fear and anxiety might look a little different if the family does happen to be living in a danger zone, but the reassurance is still imperative. “Let the [children] know that you have a safety plan,” Waters says. “Explain the safety plan to your kids, tell them what you have done and what you’re going to do. It’s about not overwhelming the child with all the details of the safety plan, but more like ‘we’ve bought sandbags’ or ‘you bring the teddy bear, or the dog’.” According to Waters, one of the big causes of fear and anxiety for children is the loss of control, “so giving them little tasks that they can have control over is going to help them feel less out of control”. Sticking to a predictable routine like a family movie night, dog bathing, or walking around the block adds normalcy and helps children feel safe – as does physical connection with their parents or carers. “Kids feel safe when they can hug their mom and hug their dad, and that’s because physical touch triggers an oxytocin response,” she explains. “Oxytocin is a neurohormone [that] floods our body, and when we have high levels of oxytocin it shuts off cortisol, [which] is our stress and fear hormone.” But when it comes to anxiety, it is quite uncertain – just like the future. “The way you would normally reduce anxiety is to talk about a positive future, which is a little bit hard for us parents because of everything that’s happening in the world. “Localising the conversation to things within a two-year time period, such taking a family holiday, transitioning from primary school to high school, or starting a new hobby, moving to a new house … can help to reduce that anxiety by presenting some certainty about the future.” Survivor’s guilt, Waters explains, might also be a recurring concern in many families. How can we raise children to be attuned to the suffering of others without making them feel guilty about their own lives? “Start with [addressing] the suffering, then progress to the positive in order to restore resilience,” she advises. “You’ve got to recognise the hurt and the pain but [also] acknowledge there are small moments of good that we have to latch on to. You have to use that positivity as a feedback loop back into the pain.” Waters says it’s important, too, to distinguish between resolving the problems and supporting those who are suffering. Sharon Turner, school psychologist at Strathcona Girls Grammar, encourages parents to create moments of joy and connection with their kids in nature to restore balance and emotional wellbeing, and recommends checking in with those who have experienced grief, loss, trauma or war to let them know you’re up for a chat or some support. She also suggests small, practical tips for kids keen to do a little more. “Take action,” she says. “Children can write a letter to the local member of federal parliament, send care packages or messages to those in affected areas, place flags in their windows and make a chalk drawing of support on their footpaths.” Participating in fundraisers and raising awareness in your own communities also helps. Waters suggests explaining to children that their wellbeing is pivotal in being able to help others. She gives an example of what a parent might say to their child: “You being happy in Australia might help you build your resilience and reserves, so that when you are old enough to step in and help [others] you have the capacity to do so.”  Sarah Ayoub is a journalist, academic and author of books for young adults and children",Opinion/Opinion,"How can I reassure my child about current affairs?

3/10/2022,"An earthquake hit Melbourne, The Taliban took Kabul and the Demons won their first grand final in 57 years. All that was immaterial, of course. The countdown to trade period was on in earnest, and the boys at Trade Radio were already pulling 18-hour shifts. Day or night, you could tune in and hear a variation of the following conversation - “I wouldn’t say he’s elite…but I wouldn’t say he isn’t elite either.” “He has huge upside SOS.” “Oh massive upside, Damo.” “500k is unders, don’t you think Lordo? “Definitely overs for me Kaneo.” In Show Me the Money, a three-part documentary that premieres on Stan on Thursday night, the trade period, the draft, the deals and the horse trading are examined in considerable detail. Craig Hutchison, the man behind Trade Radio, calls the period footy’s equivalent of The Shawshank Redemption. Indeed, for some of us, it’s akin to six weeks bunked down with Bogs Diamond. But it’s increasingly popular. It rates its socks off. Every October, otherwise functioning adults will bail you up with seven-way trade scenarios – complete with diagrams, arrows, and six players you’ve never heard of. Ultimately, it’s less about selling hope, and more about providing content. Despite the title of this documentary, money is almost never mentioned. Instead it’s all about picks, swaps, poker faces and hedged bets. It’s about player managers, who often carry themselves like real estate agents. When they’re not on the golf course, they’re on the driving range. They’re a study of how many intonations of the word “mate” you can squeeze into a single sentence. To their credit, they generally have their players’ – sorry, their clients’ – best interests at heart. So many of the players are dealing with very real and very normal problems – a homesick partner, a new baby, a boss that hates them. Their manager is there to help, to cut a deal, to facilitate a new start. In many ways, the players are peripheral. They’re names on a whiteboard. They’re bargaining chips. They’re shopped around for chickenfeed. They’re swapped for a “future third”. While Rory Lobb and Jeremy Finlayson’s sporting careers are being decided, they’re out fishing. When Bobby Hill’s dreams of returning to Melbourne are scuppered at the last minute, he’s in the tattooist’s chair. We meet Luke Dunstan, who’s fallen out of favour with his coach, and out of love with the game. “Clubs aren’t willing to give up collateral,” his manager tells him. “It’s shit for you guys – it’s not really player friendly. Unfortunately, it’s just the way the system works, mate.” They discuss his options. Gold Coast seem vaguely keen. He could get some work as a carpenter. Out of nowhere, the reigning premiers snap him up. So much of the language emanating from football clubs these days is about the communal – about connection, about playing your role, about leaving your ego on the hook. But in reality, especially during trade period, it’s every man for himself. It’s George Costanza when the fire alarm goes off. The young draftees are a bit less jaded. They’re “full of upside”, “first round locks”, “contested ball beasts” and “young men of outstanding character”. They’re all “pretty excited to get stuck into it”. When they make their debut, there’ll be the obligatory social media video - neatly packaged and suitably soppy. Some of them will be set up for life. But many won’t make it. Many careers will fizzle out. They’ll have “little currency”. They’ll be shunted from club to club. They’ll have that youthful vim sucked out of them. They may be left to rot on the Gold Coast, or out at Casey Fields. The coach might hate them. Their brains might be mush by 25. They might not actually be that good. They’ll be farewelled with a two-sentence press release. Even if you’re the top pick, there are no guarantees. From the moment he was drafted, Tom Boyd hated football and all its associated bullshit. Jon Patton had three knee reconstructions, left Hawthorn amid complaints that saw him apologise for his inappropriate behaviour towards women, and is now selling real estate on the Gold Coast. Paddy McCartin suffered concussion after concussion, had to re-train his neural pathways and only recently was offered a lifeline on Sydney’s rookie list. The draftees in Show Me the Money are so knowing, so polished. But they’re just boys. They’re the Covid generation of draftees. They’re the unraced colt who hasn’t been seen at the trials. One sobs when his number isn’t called out, and his good mate is snapped up. One is flanked by his grandparents. As each club bypasses him, he slumps a little further in his seat. For Jason Horne-Francis, there are no such indignities. He has a pet turtle, a teenage moustache, a manager who once won Big Brother and a highlights reel that can make your brain yelp. He also has one of those footy heads – a calm, assessing, distant look that suggests not a scintilla of self-doubt. Luke Hodge had it. Joel Selwood still has it. Writing about both of them in The Age, Tim Boyle noticed “a glimpse of the wilderness behind their eyes”. “It’s not a thinking place,” he wrote. “But a deep cave of fortitude.” Horne-Francis is in the system now. He’ll be tagged, harassed and analysed to within an inch of his life. He’ll carry the hopes of a football club. He looks like the can handle it. But in the spirit of Trade Radio and Show Me The Money, that’s just a guess.",Sport/Sport,AFL players on the periphery with agents front and centre during trade period | Jonathan Horn,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/10/afl-players-on-the-periphery-with-agents-front-and-centre-during-trade-period
3/10/2022,"The Israeli defence contractor Elbit Systems has denied producing cluster munitions after two big investment funds banned investment in the company, saying it was involved with the weapons. Cluster munitions are outlawed under Australian law and an international treaty because of their devastating effect on civilians. Both Australia’s sovereign wealth fund, the $200bn Future Fund, and Norway’s largest pension fund, the $136bn KLP, have banned investment in Elbit over its alleged association with certain weapons. Cluster munitions, which were allegedly used by Russian forces during the invasion of Ukraine, are bombs that contain smaller bomblets that scatter as they drop from the air. Under an international convention they are banned by 110 states, including Australia, because they kill and maim civilians and because, like landminesthey can remain a deadly hazard years after a conflict is over. Israel is not a signatory. Government tender data shows that Elbit, which employs the former minister for defence Christopher Pyne as a lobbyist, is a major supplier to the Australian defence force, winning more than $1.8bn of work since 2007. This includes a controversial battle management system, designed to keep commanders in touch with troops in the field. The army last year ordered troops to stop using the system amid reports of security fears among soldiers. Elbit has consistently denied there are any security issues with its system. “The June 2021 Senate Estimates, Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee heard from the Department of Defence and Australian Signals Directorate there have been no security issues with our software,” a spokesperson said. Elbit has also repeatedly denied making cluster munitions since 2018, when it took over IMI Systems, formerly known as Israeli Military Industries, which previously produced the weapons. In its public declaration of excluded companies, the Future Fund lists Elbit Systems as one of eight firms barred from investment because of “exclusions related to military weapons-related Conventions or Treaties ratified by Australia”. The Future Fund declined to explain in detail why it last year excluded Elbit from investment, with a spokesperson saying the decision was based on data that could not be passed on to Guardian Australia because it was the intellectual property of a third-party information provider company. But in a report released in November, KLP said it was excluding Elbit Systems from its investments because “it is clear that the company produces cluster munitions”. In its report, KLP provided details, including model numbers of the cluster munitions it claims Elbit produces through IMI Systems. These include “miniature intelligent multipurpose submunitions”, which are “a smart cluster munitions system equipped with sensors to program and identify targets”, as well as conventional munitions that each contain dozens of bomblets, KLP said. KLP’s head of responsible investments, Kiran Aziz, told Guardian Australia the fund got much of its information about Elbit from MSCI, an American financial information provider. “In addition, we use publicly available information from NGOs and what a company reports,” she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Asked why KLP did not believe Elbit’s denials of involvement in cluster munitions, she said: “We relied on information we have from MSCI as our data provider which is quite updated.” However, she said KLP did not claim that Elbit produced the bomblet that sits inside the cluster munitions systems it allegedly produces. “Elbit was already excluded due to a violation of our criterion of human rights violations for their involvement in the occupied Palestinian territory,” she said. “They have now also been excluded under our criterion of involvement in controversial weapons. The reason why we exclude companies with reference to several criteria when they have already been excluded, is that all the reasons are important to state, and that we do not want to risk the companies being included in the portfolio again if the first exclusion basis ceases.” In a 15 February letter, provided by Elbit to Guardian Australia, the company’s chief legal officer and executive vice president, Jonathan Ariel, said Elbit “has never been engaged in the production or sale of cluster munitions”. “Following the acquisition of IMI Systems Ltd in 2018, Elbit Systems discontinued all activities of IMI relating to IMI’s legacy cluster munitions,” he said. He said the company, including IMI, complied with the international convention banning cluster munitions. Rawan Arraf, executive director of Australian Centre for International Justice, said the Future Fund was right to be concerned about Elbit’s alleged association with cluster munitions but that it should also be concerned about its supply of the surveillance systems and other products and services used by Israeli authorities, which she says amounts to aiding and abetting serious human rights abuses against the Palestinian people. “There is a major incongruity when an Australian public agency rightly excludes Elbit Systems, yet Australian state and federal governments happily enter into lucrative contractual agreements with it.” The defence department did not respond to detailed questions about its dealings with Elbit.

3/10/2022,"As the flood waters rose in Lismore, hundreds of locals went out in their boats to rescue those whose homes had suddenly been swallowed. The community flotilla dwarfed the crews filled by volunteers for the State Emergency Service, who at one point were ordered to pull back because the situation had become too dangerous. The Australian defence force arrived later, rescuing 113 people. The speed of the response was widely criticised by locals, sparking calls for a specialised arm of the ADF which is trained and resourced to respond to natural disasters. The royal commission into national natural disaster arrangements, which examined the ADF in response to the 2019-2020 bushfires, said the ADF should “not be seen as a first responder for natural disasters, nor relied on as such”. But experts have said that while there are cultural, practical and constitutional issues with making the army a frontline first responder to domestic disasters, it is the only organisation which currently has the funding to do the work required. On Wednesday the number of ADF personnel on the ground in New South Wales more than doubled, to a force of more than 3,000, most of which were deployed in the northern rivers region. There were another 1,200 working over the border in south-eastern Queensland. They were tasked with helping clean-up efforts in Lismore, Broadwater, Cabbage Tree Island, Coffs Harbour, Grafton, Murwillumbah, Port Macquarie, Tweed Heads-Byron Bay, Wallum and Woodburn, as well as conducting welfare checks via helicopter and helping the SES with remote food drops. Peter Dutton told breakfast television on Tuesday that he was “not going to cop criticism of the ADF” for the speed of their response. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, echoed his defence minister during a press conference in Lismore on Wednesday, defending the speed of ADF response. However he did concede they could not be made “available on a moment’s notice”, saying that was an unrealistic expectation. But locals who have been coordinating their own disaster response for more than a week say it is unreasonable to expect community volunteers to have to crowdfund their own emergency response in the absence of sufficient government support. Emma Palmer is one of the civilians who has spent the past week covered in mud, trying to deliver food to those trapped by flood waters and help with the long clean-up process. The Griffith University lecturer lives at Bangalow, an area of the Byron Bay hinterland that was out of the reach of flood waters. Her husband was one of the boaties out in flood waters in Lismore on 28 February, rescuing people from rooftops. “If the community had not gone in there with their private boats, hundreds of people would have died, there’s no question about that,” she says. There is significant anger in the community that the ADF did not take control of that first response. “There has been a group in this country that can go in and save lives, unless we think it’s acceptable for those lives to be lost,” Palmer says. She spent Tuesday at Woodburn, helping clean up and provide food to volunteers. “I did see some ADF troops … mostly standing around, seems to be the common theme,” she says. “I also saw a lot of community members out there with gloves on – some of them not with gloves on – shovelling mud, loading people’s belongings into wheelbarrows, and piling it all up and moving it along. A lot of very frustrated people, but a lot of community spirit coming through.” Palmer says there is a need for a properly resourced and trained national disaster response agency, similar to the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the United States, which is able to quickly respond to disasters. It would need to be flexible, locally responsive, and not rely on a top-down organisation. Those criteria would exclude the ADF. “The disasters that are confronting us in Australia require that kind of assistance,” Palmer says. “And if they can’t do it then someone needs to.” Palmer says it is unreasonable that the burden of response and recovery has been placed on affected communities. “It’s reasonable to expect and foresee a community will lift up and help each other in a time of emergency,” she says. “But given how foreseeable it is that this crisis will continue, it is just not right or appropriate or safe or sustainable, or even productive from an economic perspective to make [community volunteers] the main arm of recovery.” Former commissioner for the Australian Capital Territory Emergency Services Authority, Peter Dunn, said he felt “quite angry and disappointed” that state and federal governments had not improved their emergency response in the wake of the 2019-2020 bushfires. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, admitted during a Radio National interview on Tuesday that the state had not improved its emergency response after the devastating bushfires, but said it would do so in response to the floods. Dunn told the ABC: “We need to have a system where people are deployed into areas that are isolated to actually act as the coordinating pivot point for any of this response, and then the recovery that follows that. “And that’s not happened and I feel quite angry and disappointed that after all the reviews and all the reports and the commission reports and everything following fires and floods previously, our leaders have done nothing about this. The lessons are there. They haven’t been learned and they darn well need to be.” The royal commission, which handed down its final report in the ebb between the first and second waves of the coronavirus pandemic, warned that the “increasing complexity of disaster risks presents new challenges that could overwhelm the capabilities of our emergency services”. More than 20% of all submissions to the royal commission referred to the ADF, and suggested it could be a source of support in national disasters. But the final report stated that while the ADF could provide support in recovery, it should not be relied upon for more than ancillary support. “Generally, the public perception was that the ADF could assist in every aspect and was always readily available,” the report said. “This is not, in fact, the case. Nor is it a reasonable expectation of the ADF.” Mark Duckworth, a senior research fellow at the Centre for Resilient and Inclusive Societies at Deakin University, said there was a need for a well-funded and trained surge capacity of first responders in addition to back-up help from the ADF. “We turn to the ADF in the absence of anything else,” Duckworth says. “We do need to fund and maintain increased surge capacity. One of the problems in Australia is this type of surge capacity, in times where there isn’t an emergency, is seen as superfluous resources which we don’t want to maintain. But you can’t conjure up resources in a time of disaster. We should be looking at additional surge capacity that is funded and trained, in addition to the ADF.” Dunn suggested part of that the investment should go into local governments, to take over in a professional capacity the response, rebuilding and recovery work that is currently being done by thousands of volunteers. Prof Susan Harris Rimmer, a researcher in climate justice at Griffith University, also said the investment should go to local first responders – after investment in mitigation efforts to reduce the risk in the first place. “You should never bank on volunteers, but our system banks on volunteers,” she says. “People have got to understand that climate change changes the game. You can’t have people doing this kind of work for free on a voluntary basis. This stuff is actually predictable and bad and it’s gone up a notch and we need professional coordination.” Harris Rimmer grew up in Lismore and helped her father evacuate from the city. She says Lismore will not recover without “massive government investment”. “Those people aren’t going to be able to put that town back together by themselves no matter how strong a community they are,” she says. “This is a community I love, this is where I spent my high school years, in that school that everyone’s seen with the water up to the roof. And it’s not the people of Lismore’s fault that that happened to them. “So where are we in that conversation then? Should they bear all the responsibility for living in Lismore in the first place, is that the way it works now?” Research on disaster response shows that investment at a local community level is more effective than a top-down national approach, Harris Rimer says. “You see these people who are left alone for days and days feeling justifiably angry, but if you don’t invest in first responders that’s what’s going to happen,” she says. “It takes time to deploy people from other places especially in an emergency so you need to have that localised first responder network really organised.” But she says that a failure of government planning and investment means that there is no alternative but to use the ADF in disaster response when an emergency is bigger than can be managed by local networks alone. “The defence force is the only one with decent funding,” she says. “They are so expensive to use, they’re not designed for these types of issues, and it’s not appropriate to use them. But we haven’t made decent plans.”",News/Australia news,‘The lessons haven’t been learned’: who should lead Australia’s disaster recovery response?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/10/the-lessons-havent-been-learned-who-should-lead-australias-disaster-recovery-response
3/10/2022,"The number of non-melanoma skin cancers in Australia continues to rise steadily each year, despite successful sun-safe education campaigns, new research has found. The increase in cases of 2-6% each year for the past three decades was driven by those aged 55 and above, according to the study led by Associate Prof Catherine Olsen from the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, published on Thursday. Prof David Whiteman, a senior author on the study from the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, said despite the strong sun-safe messaging Australians are now exposed to, the rise in cases was being driven by sun damage catching up with people in older age groups who experienced UV exposure in their youth. “And so as our population is living longer and more people move into those age groups that manifest in cancer, they’re now showing the effects of their sun exposure from years and decades before,” he said. “The good news is that it’s never too late to use sun protection, and that even people in their 40s and beyond who start using sun protection every single day can reduce their risk of skin cancer and reduce the incidence of new skin cancers forming if they’ve already had it.” Researchers said the increase in cases may be an underestimate because data on non-melanoma skin cancers is not recorded in state and territory cancer registries, except in Tasmania. Olsen and her colleagues said this must change, and recommended that population-based cancer registries work towards statutory notification and routine reporting of all non-melanoma skin cancers. These are also known as basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas (collectively known as keratinocyte cancers). Because of a lack of routine reporting, the researchers analysed six previous studies that used Medicare data, data from the Tasmanian registry on keratinocyte diagnoses or population surveys asking people about any confirmed skin cancer diagnosis. They aggregated this data to calculate lifetime risk of developing keratinocyte cancer using estimate methods established by Cancer Research UK. While the authors acknowledged their findings were limited by national incidence rates being out of date and of moderate quality, and the fact that many suspicious skin lesions are removed by doctors before a cancer diagnosis has been confirmed so would not have been captured in the Medicare data or surveys, their analysis nonetheless “indicates very high rates of keratinocyte cancer in Australia”. “Incidence of keratinocyte cancer in Australia appears to have increased by 2–6% per year over the past three decades,” the study, published in Public Health Research & Practice, a peer-reviewed journal of the Sax Institute, found. “We estimate that 69% of Australians will have at least one excision for keratinocyte cancer in their lifetime.” Whiteman said people sometimes thought that because keratinocyte cancers are less deadly and tend to grow slower than melanoma, they do not need to be concerned by them. “But keratinocyte cancers kill about 500 people a year, and if not treated they can borrow into nerves on the face and into the head and track back into the brain. People may need to have massive surgery and radiotherapy. So it is a dreadful disease.” The study found declines in keratinocyte cancer rates over time in younger age groups. However, Heather Walker, chair of Cancer Council Australia’s Skin Cancer Committee, said it was important sun-safe campaigns and advertising continued to be funded. Data published on 2 March by SunSmart showed 2020-2021 had the highest number of sunburn presentations to emergency departments in Victoria since 2016-2017, and presentations in the summer were highest among adolescents aged 10-19 years (34%). In December, the federal government announced funding for the first national skin cancer campaign in over a decade.",News/Society,Skin cancers on the rise in Australia as sun damage catches up with ageing population,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/10/skin-cancers-on-the-rise-in-australia-as-sun-damage-catches-up-with-ageing-population
3/10/2022,"Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a disorder characterised by extreme fatigue that can’t be fully explained by any other medical condition. Research suggests exercise may have a positive effect on fatigue in people with CFS but the evidence is limited, and even small amounts of exertion can lead to post-exertional malaise. Sarah Comensoli, an exercise physiologist, says it’s counterintuitive to start exercising if you know there’s a risk it will lead to malaise. Exercise isn’t a cure, Comensoli says, but it can help build function and strength, and improve sleep and energy levels. “We don’t focus on taking all the pain away, but we keep the focus on function,” she says. “Exercise can help people do more.” Inactivity makes the body even less able to handle exertion and can exacerbate other symptoms, such as pain and stiffness. But Andrew Fitzgerald, a musculoskeletal and sports physiotherapist, says everyone has different limits when it comes to exercise, and it is crucial for people with CFS to be aware of theirs. For some people exercise might not be recommended. Here is a simple guide to exercising when living with CFS. It is always advised to seek advice from a physiotherapist or doctor before you begin an exercise program. Exercise can make the disease much worse if not done appropriately. Pilates-based conditioning exercises offer a gentle, complete body workout that is adaptable to various levels of fitness and may be beneficial for people with CFS. It combines stretching and strengthening floor exercises aiming at toning the whole body through controlled and precise movements. Pilates exercises focus on strengthening core muscles, which can help support the rest of the body. A strong core can ease the strain on the back and limbs, potentially resulting in less fatigue. Pilates may not be the place to start for those who have not been active for a while. But for those who already have a certain level of mobility and low levels of stiffness, pilates can improve strength and overall fitness. “Reclined or recumbent exercises are generally a good place to start for someone with chronic fatigue,” says Melissa Williams, an integrative physiotherapist. Floor-based strength exercises can counteract the de-conditioning of muscles that occurs when individuals go through prolonged periods without exercise. A simple version of the leg press is one exercise that can help strengthen the lower body. Begin by lying on your back with knees bent at 90 degrees and your feet in the air. Place a resistance band under the arches of your feet, holding the ends of the band in your hands, and regulate the tension by moving your hands towards or away from your armpits. Bring your knees towards your chest without lifting your hips off the ground and then push your legs away from you, against the resistance band, as far as it feels comfortable. Then bring your knees back to your chest. You can further modify the exercise by extending one leg at a time or eliminating the resistance band. Strengthening major muscles, such as the leg muscles, may improve mechanical efficiency when carrying out daily activities. But when performing resistance exercises such as the leg press, it is strongly recommended not to reach exhaustion because that may exacerbate fatigue. “[Exercise] is about making sure someone can function in their day to day tasks, before worrying about doing anything too technical or hardcore,” Comensoli says. The energy demands of walking can be significantly greater for people with CFS compared with other people. But regular walks, even if for only a few minutes, may help people with CFS get moving in a manageable way. Wearing a pedometer and a heart rate monitor can help you measure how far – and at what intensity – you can walk before you reach a state of fatigue. That can help you establish the level of activity that you can bear without suffering any adverse effects or post-exertional malaise. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning “High intensity or endurance type activities, such as long-distance running, are not recommended,” Fitzgerald says. “It’s not to say that those things are indefinitely off the table,” Williams says. “But having a program tailored to how your body is responding is important.” Williams says progress is not always gradual nor linear, and rest plays a crucial role in CFS management. “Some CFS sufferers feel like they need to push through in order to get better or to progress,” she says. “Our advice to people is to listen to their body and follow what it’s telling them to do.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,How to move: exercising with chronic fatigue syndrome,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/10/how-to-move-exercising-with-chronic-fatigue-syndrome
3/10/2022,"Covid cases are rising again in several Australian states, most rapidly in Western Australia, though the spike there has not been accompanied by a rise in severe disease. WA has recorded 29,839 total cases over the pandemic, but 17,641 of those were recorded in just the last seven days. Meanwhile New South Wales, Tasmania, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory have also reported a rise in cases over the past week, though much less steep. Dr Michael Lydeamore, an infectious disease modeller and epidemiologist with Monash University in Melbourne, said the rises were unsurprising. In WA, testing rates are strong. But despite the rising case numbers, no one is in intensive care. “There is data that says infection-inquired immunity is strong in places like NSW and Victoria, and that exposure gives you protection,” Lydeamore said. “There were certainly stories of people in NSW getting 15 close contact notifications a week from the check-in app. WA hasn’t had that level of exposure to the virus. They’re relying only on vaccine protection which is good, but they’re also slightly behind on their general vaccine program, including the rollout of boosters. “There is also no lockdown in WA. I’m not suggesting they should have one, but most other places had strict restrictions when cases took off. “So I am not surprised by the spike in numbers, but the important thing is that these cases aren’t translating into a big increase in people getting severe disease [and] requiring hospital care or worse. That speaks to vaccine success.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning As for rises in other states, Lydeamore said a combination of factors were working together such as: a return to school; the growing prevalence of BA.2, a more infectious sub-variant of Omicron which is also increasing in WA; and more movement generally as restrictions ease and people return to offices. Across the country, there has also been a sharp rise of 10 to 19-year-olds with Covid-19, with cases in this age group comprising over 20% of all infections in recent days. The return to schools was driving this, not just in terms of spread, but because states and territories have rapid-antigen testing programs and other requirements in place for schools, which mean more cases in young people are being detected. While the compulsory RAT program in NSW has been dropped, RAT testing kits are still being offered to families who want them. “The probability of detecting cases in children is now much higher,” Lydeamore said. There have also been rises in cases in specific local government areas in Melbourne, bucking the trend of declining case numbers in most areas. Melbourne reported 485 cases in the last seven days compared with 311 in the previous seven. Eastern and south-eastern suburbs reported similar trends, including Boroondara, which rose to 538 cases in the past seven days compared with 401 cases the week prior, Stonnington which jumped to 281 cases from 194, and Glen Eira where cases jumped to 581 from 443. “All of those areas are fairly affluent, which is associated with more travel and movement,” Lydeamore said. “It’s possible now that travel overseas is available people are also bringing Covid back. The other thing, of course, is that there are also a large number of people who were working from home in those suburbs, and now they’re not. And workplaces are a great place for transmission.” A spokesperson for the Victorian department of health said case numbers fluctuate for a variety of reasons including increased movement associated with more people returning to work and attending school. “This is the first time the number of Covid-19 cases in hospital in Victoria has been below 200 since 16 September last year,” they said. NSW recorded 13,179 positive test results on Wednesday, with the Western Sydney and Northern Sydney local health districts recording the highest number of cases.",News/World news,Covid cases rise across Australia but ICU admissions remain low,https://www.theguardian.com/world/datablog/2022/mar/10/covid-cases-rise-across-australia-but-icu-admissions-remain-low
3/10/2022,"The philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche once said that hope in reality is the worst of all evils because it prolongs the torments of man. Nietzsche would not have coped well in rugby league and certainly not on the eve of a new season where hope is at its high watermark. In a game whose narrative is often beset by negativity and narkiness, the last days before a new campaign kicks off are often the last days of optimism and, arguably, the NRL has never been more optimistic about a season. Rugby league playing states seem to be moving towards the new norm of Covid. Restrictions are gone. Teams – the Warriors are the only exception at this stage – will play at home in front of fans. Financial figures released show the NRL in the most secure, stable position in its history with revenue up 37% and cash reserves up by $45m. Rule tinkering has been kept at a minimum and the one notable change – awarding a penalty rather than a six-again for a deliberate penalty on an attacker coming out of their own half – has been met with near-universal relief. With all teams level on the ladder and an entire season to play out, it is not just the increase in club grants by 5% that has even the least realistic of clubs clinging to even the flimsiest reed of hope. The Broncos have put their faith in Ben Ikin to rebuild the club’s list and with Adam Reynolds, Kurt Capewell and Ryan James in his first class there is a belief their leadership should lift the club back into the top eight after going 10-34 for two bottom three finishes the last two years. The Bulldogs, fresh out of a half-decade of salary cap hell, have made it rain for a long list of recruits headed by premiership winner Matt Burton and rep star Josh Addo-Carr. Reputations held little sway with the likes of Paul Vaughan, Tevita Pangai Jnr and Brent Naden all looking for some kind of redemption after off-field incidents. Trent Barrett will need to meld together the team quickly though to get off the hottest of coaching seats. The Raiders look to be ushering in a new generation. The Cowboys are on bended knee hoping their halves investment pays off. The Dragons are up-and-about on the back of a dominant Charity Shield win. The Titans project as big improvers as the club continues to build under highly promising coach Justin Holbrook. No team from the bottom half of the ladder has more reason for hope though than Cronulla. The Sharks made huge waves when they snagged highly-rated assistant Craig Fitzgibbon early last season and it certainly resonated with those off-contract with big names Nicho Hynes and Dale Finucane both joining the club. Cronulla view themselves as genuine title contenders with not only the talent but the cultural changes the former Storm duo bring. The genuine title contenders probably number at best six and likely just three. The hope at South Sydney, Parramatta and Manly is certainly there but where will they find the lift to elevate them that next step or three? None of the trio have improved their rosters. Souths have lost the most successful coach the game has ever known as well as their organising half and now rookie halfback Lachlan Ilias shoulders the burden. The Eels have a roster very similar to that of recent years that has thrived in the regular season and shot blanks in the finals. Manly are hoping for a repeat of Tom Trbojevic’s magical 2021. When it comes to true designs on lifting that premiership trophy, the three teams that hold the aces are Penrith, Melbourne and the Sydney Roosters – coached by the three best mentors in the game. The Panthers will need to defy nearly all recent history to go back-to-back and ride their golden generation to another title. Penrith’s depth has taken a hit and they will start their season with star Nathan Cleary on the sidelines but there is no questioning the talent on their list. The Roosters were arguably the unluckiest – and most courageous – team of 2021 and with even a fair injury run in 2022 will be right in contention. Trent Robinson is among the game’s best thinkers and with decent health combined with the experience gained from so much young talent last year it is more than conceivable to see the Tricolours back in the grand final for the third time in five years. No team enters the season more stung than the Storm. Craig Bellamy’s team were historic in their brilliance in 2021, breaking a tremendous number of attacking records while maintaining their classic defensive fortress. It all slipped away though during a forgettable 80-minute semi-final showing against Penrith. Redemption has historically been a major driver for the Storm and will be at the crux of their push for another title. Come Monday, it will all be different. As it sits though, with the first match still yet to be played, hope washes over all and the unusual feeling of optimism looms large over the game.",Sport/Sport,Hope springs eternal ahead of NRL season but genuine title contenders are sparse | Nick Tedeschi,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/10/hope-springs-eternal-ahead-of-nrl-season-but-genuine-title-contenders-are-sparse
3/10/2022,"Walking through Queer: Stories from the NGV Collection is an experience of sensory overload. Classical paintings and busts make way for rumbling video works and mannequins dressed in high fashion. Behind glass, there are objects old and new: an ancient teapot, a pair of Comme des Garçons shoes. My gaze keeps wandering back to two pieces: one is a huge floral and golden wreath surrounding an image of the artist, Yasumasa Morimura, reimagined as Frida Kahlo. The other is Paul Yore’s 2021 work, The Evacuation of Mallacoota: an enormous abstract patchwork of textures, faces and colours, reflecting on the 2019 bushfires. Two works, so different from one another, yet both hold me gently as I continue through. An Australian first, Queer contains more than 400 artworks, from Egyptian amulets made in 664BC to work produced in Australia today. The pieces are all from the National Gallery of Victoria’s permanent collection but some have never been displayed publicly before. Celebrating queerness both explicit and tacit, it’s a dazzling and sometimes overwhelming kaleidoscope of the myriad ways in which sexuality and gender can be experienced and expressed. The exhibition is broken into themes, with an exhibition highlight, David Wojnarowicz’s confronting 1990 Aids response Untitled (for Act Up), included in the show’s history of activism. Light and dark interchange: a room dedicated to experiences of shame and discrimination details historical brutalisation (viewer discretion is advised). A playful section is dedicated to royalty both queer and actual, highlighting icons including Kylie Minogue and Liza Minnelli, and outfits including Lizzy Gardiner’s gold AmEx dress, worn by the Australian costume designer when she won an Oscar for Priscilla, Queen of the Desert; it is even more eye-popping in the flesh. Of course, a show like this will have absences, but the NGV curatorsinvolved, spanning international to Indigenous art, stress that Queer is as much about what is not included. These gaps speak to the practice of art acquisition, a process that favours the systemically privileged. Much of the historical collection, for instance, pertains primarily to the western world, with only a smattering of eastern stories. “We acknowledge that some areas are much better represented than others,” says Dr Angela Hesson, the NGV’s curator of Australian art. “In that way, we’ve also had the opportunity to interrogate our history of collecting.” But, clearly, care has been taken. What’s particularly delightful about the exhibition is the juxtaposition of seemingly unrelated pieces to create a dialogue – for instance, the Black trans artist Tourmaline’s mesmerising video work ​​Atlantic Is a Sea of Bones, is side by side with one of Nick Cave’s audio Soundsuits. Other connections are more overt, such as the positioning of works by the early 20th century Australian artists Margaret Preston, Bessie Davidson and Gladys Reynell – three women who had romantic relationships with one another. Indigenous artists include the young Queenslander Dylan Mooney, whose striking work Stuck on You depicts two embracing Black men with their faces painted, and Hannah Brontë, whose video work Umma’s Tongue – molten at 6000° pairs the Black female body with images of natural destruction. “Being part of this is for my people, my community, my big gay-ass family,” Brontë says. Meg Slater, one of the show’s curators, describes Queer as “embracing the maybe and the probably, and working against this idea that really does exist as an institutional standard that it’s heterosexual until proven otherwise”. Many of the artists exhibited lived in a time where identifying openly as queer was not possible, and some others were not queer at all – but their works take on what the curators call a “queer afterlife”. One example is Saint George Hare’s 1891 oil painting The Victory of Faith, which depicts two intertwined nude, interracial women, one shackled; long read as a depiction of Christian martyrs, in Queer, a viewer can see subversion inherent in its subject and form. And for ancient historical content, the curators employed lateral thinking. “We know that many of the ancient Greek and Roman gods and goddesses were pansexual … it’s a matter of saying, ‘OK, which representations of those gods and goddesses do we have in the collection?’” says Dr Ted Gott, the NGV’s senior curator of international art. “Queer stories have never been told about these famous people on our walls before this show.” Queer will reward multiple visits and close examination. From well-known artists including Keith Haring, Issey Miyake and Robert Indiana to more obscure names, culminating in a final, glitter-soaked room, there’s a lot to take in, explore and ponder. Still, my mind returns to those first two works, An Inner Dialogue with Frida Kahlo and The Evacuation of Mallacoota; and all the ways these works subvert or abandon gender, blend histories and culture, and make something new. Like a bowerbird, the queer experience is often about observing and borrowing from the world around oneself – to create a wondrous kind of meaning, a new mode of survival.

Anthony Albanese will consider fitting tomahawk missiles to Australia’s existing fleet of Collins class submarines if he wins the upcoming federal election. The Labor leader will on Thursday vow to ensure the defence force “has the resources it needs to defend Australia and deter potential aggressors”. As the opposition leader attempts to neutralise the Coalition’s political attack on Labor over national security, the government will also on Thursday make its own pledge to significantly ramp up the number of defence personnel over two decades. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, is set to visit Brisbane and announce that the Defence workforce will grow by 18,500 by 2040. That means Defence’s total permanent workforce will be about 101,000, including almost 80,000 ADF personnel, by that year. The government estimates the cost of the expansion is at least $38bn spread over the period 2024 to 2040. “The first priority of my government is keep Australians safe and to do that we need a bigger ADF with more soldiers, sailors and airmen and women to operate the cutting-edge capabilities we’re getting to protect Australia,” Morrison said in a statement. The government’s force structure plan, released in 2020, had already flagged the need for “longer term growth” in military and civilian personnel “across the next two decades”. It is understood the details of those plans were agreed at a meeting of cabinet’s national security committee nearly four months ago. Albanese will use his scheduled speech to the Lowy Institute on Thursday to pledge to spend more than 2% of Australia’s gross domestic product on defence, which the Coalition says fell to 1.56% in the Gillard government’s 2012-13 budget. The Labor leader will declare that a defining characteristic of the Coalition government “is an enduring focus on announcements but not on the delivery of them” and will castigate its handling of the submarine project as the country’s “greatest defence procurement disaster”. Albanese will also sketch out a broader concept of national security, saying strengthening democratic institutions and protecting social cohesion are “a powerful defence against the threat of modern authoritarianism”. The opposition leader will warn that “the clock keeps ticking relentlessly on climate change”, which he sees as “a threat with serious direct implications for the security and wellbeing of Australians and our region”. If Labor wins the May election, it will ask the head of the Office of National Intelligence and the secretary of the defence department to produce a risk assessment of the implications of climate change for national security. Labor has backed the Aukus partnership with the US and the UK, but has also raised concerns about the potential “capability gap”, given that the first of the nuclear-propelled submarines are unlikely to be ready until about 2040. Albanese will pledge to consider other ways to boost defence capability in the decades before these submarines are ready, saying Labor will need to “deliver a frank assessment of our capabilities and pipeline on arrival in government”. “For instance, we will consider whether tomahawk missiles can be fitted to the Collins-class submarines,” Albanese will tell the Lowy Institute. Albanese will also promise to “review progress” on the trouble-plagued Future Frigates project, which is running behind schedule and is having engineering problems. A Labor government would “explore whether our naval power could be bolstered through upgraded weapons on the Arafura-class offshore patrol vessels or through additional Hobart-class Air Warfare Destroyers”. “We would also work with Defence and those experts who have identified the need for government to quickly increase Australia’s strike capabilities,” Albanese will say. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “We will deepen our regional defence cooperation with close partners – including Japan, India, Singapore and others – to bolster our joint capabilities, shape our strategic environment and uphold the rules of the road. “And Labor will plan for how we address submarine capability in the period until we receive the nuclear-powered submarines.” Albanese is not specific about what that entails, but interim options that have been publicly floated in the past include the use of a diesel-electric submarine manufactured by German company TKMS. Another short-term option, according to defence analysts, is procurement of extra-large unmanned undersea vehicles known as the “Orca”. Albanese will say the government wasted billions of dollars on the French submarine project, and the next government faces “another repair job: healing the wounds inflicted on the Australia-France relationship”. The opposition leader will also say Labor has already committed to a Defence Force Posture Review which would “provide a more reliable basis for decisions on the final location of a new submarine base”. Countering Morrison’s recent political attacks, Albanese will say that Australia’s national security interests “should transcend the partisan divide”. Albanese is also set to say that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has “trampled fundamental principles” but also that China “has failed in its special responsibility as a permanent member of the UN security council while offering Russia relief from sanctions”. Under Xi Jinping’s leadership, China has “demonstrated a harsher authoritarianism and more strident nationalism”. In the speech, Albanese will also pledge to “strengthen our political, economic and military ties with India and Japan, as well as with regional partners such as Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea and Vietnam”. Enhancing the relationship with Indonesia would also be identified as a priority. Albanese will say New Zealand is “a central partner in this regional effort – but for too long Canberra has preferred to talk at Wellington rather than realising the potential of our shared experiences”. The opposition leader will conclude by saying democratic strength is also critical to Australia’s long-term stability and security, and vowing to “restore a greater sense of responsibility to the office of prime minister”.",News/Australia news,Albanese to pledge increased defence spending as Morrison promises more personnel,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/10/albanese-to-pledge-increased-defence-spending-as-morrison-promises-more-personnel
3/10/2022,"Scott Morrison was prepared to acknowledge some realities when he arrived in Lismore on Wednesday. Australia was becoming a harder country to live in because of natural disasters, like the black summer bushfires, and the latest catastrophic floods that have killed more than 20 people. “We are dealing with a different climate to the one we are dealing with before,” the prime minister said. Morrison turned up with practical support. Cash. Promises of more defence personnel to clear out the rubbish (although that might take a month). He also opened the door on a conversation about what might need to be done locally to mitigate risk, with commonwealth funds on standby. But there was also plenty of passivity and blame shifting, which are Morrison’s core crisis characteristics. We’ve seen these same instincts flare during the bushfires, during the pandemic, and now during the floods. These qualities are now very familiar. It’s part of the reason the prime minister has lost standing with voters. On Wednesday, Morrison thought any inquiry into the quality of the disaster response in the northern rivers was a matter for the New South Wales government – not him. Morrison also thought a failure to scramble significant defence resources into the disaster zone was not actually a failure. The problem was people had unrealistic expectations about what governments could do. The prime minister noted people would always need to rely on their neighbours when catastrophe struck as opposed to a functioningtriple zero emergency service (that the Morrison government most decidedly did not run – that was Dominic Perrottet’s responsibility). There was also the odd business of the emergency declaration. Morrison’s office made it known earlier in the day he was going to make the declaration, but it later emerged he couldn’t until the states were formally on board, because that’s how the legislation (that his own government drafted and passed) actually worked. But all of this was warm up laps for peak passivity. As might have been predicted, Morrison hit peak passivity when pressed about his government’s record on the climate crisis. Morrison pretended the Coalition had always been on board with climate change despite the voluminous evidence to the contrary (including, but not limited to, the repeal of a functioning carbon price, Tony Abbott’s serious attempt to gut the renewable energy target, and, more recently, Morrison’s own hyper-partisan masterstroke, the entirely bogus “war on the weekend”). Morrison suggested his government had been so forward leaning on climate action it had been “the first government to commit by net zero by 2050”. Given Australia was one of the last countries in the developed world to actually make that commitment, and almost didn’t because of trenchant opposition from the National party – this first-cab-off-the-rank data point was perplexing to say the least. But in any case, lest all this forward leaning seem too forward, Morrison wrenched his bus into reverse. The prime minister proceeded to treat onlookers to one of his favourite tutorials: Australia makes bugger all difference when it comes to global climate action. We need to remind ourselves that this self-serving pontification by Morrison was occurring at the site of an actual disaster zone on the frontline of the climate crisis, while the traumatised residents of Lismore were milling outside still trying to process what the hell just happened. Carry on Lismore. Truly. Don’t mind us. Sure, global heating was real enough, but Morrison reminded people Australia was an emissions minnow, and nothing would stop global emissions rising until countries with rising emissions profiles were given access to technology enabling them to cut pollution. Anything else was just “warm fuzzy feelings”. This version of events – one that pretends demonstrable public policy failure has no costs or consequences – glosses over inconvenient truths like if runaway heating is a global problem (and it is), it can only be solved by rich countries like Australia pulling their weight. If every country acted with the abject derangement that Australia has exhibited for a decade, then the planet will most decidedly cook. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Another fact. Australia continues to export emissions that contribute to heating to the rest of the world like that ain’t no thing. One last fact. While Morrison was acknowledging the reality of the changing climate in Lismore, his energy minister Angus Taylor was out making the case for a further expansion of fossil fuels, and taunting European countries for not pursuing a “gas-fired recovery”. This leads us to the nub of the problem. Australia has struggled to get its disaster response right in part because federations are always complicated and imperfect beasts, and in part, because the Morrison government refuses to pull hard on the thread that will unravel the Coalition’s whole climate culture war. Getting the national disaster response right requires something radical. It requires the Coalition to be honest about the past, and about the future. To give Australians the tools they need to manage the existential threat of a heating climate, this government needs to be honest, first with itself, and then with the Australian public, about the nature of the threat. It needs to end a decade of excuses, evasions and obfuscations, and set about atoning for them. Until this government understands the magnitude of its own policy failures, until it can permit the most basic truth telling, this group of people will not be able to summon the imagination or the resolve, let alone the monumental whole-of-federation resources required to mitigate the risks and adapt to the new realities. That’s the truth.",News/Australia news,Passivity and blame shifting: Scott Morrison brings his signature crisis skills to Lismore | Katharine Murphy,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/10/passivity-and-blame-shifting-scott-morrison-brings-his-signature-crisis-skills-to-lismore
3/10/2022,"Residents in flood-ravaged areas of New South Wales excluded from the Morrison government’s additional support package are dismayed to have been ignored when in desperate need of help. The northern rivers local government areas of Richmond Valley, Lismore and Clarence Valley were offered extra rounds of disaster payments on Wednesday due to “catastrophic” flooding. But nearby shires including Ballina, Byron and Tweed – which had also been declared disaster zones after major flooding – were ineligible for the two extra $1,000 payments for affected adults. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, who was visiting flooded Lismore on Wednesday, said the National Recovery and Resilience Agency (NRRA) and Emergency Management Australia had assessed the “highest impacted areas” in need of additional support. “We’ll work closely with the NSW and Queensland governments to deliver further funding,” Morrison said. “The commonwealth disaster payments are not intended to solve every single economic need that people have.” The NRRA would “undertake an assessment of possible additional LGAs that also meet the catastrophic impact assessment”, the Morrison government said. The Murwillumbah district chamber of commerce president, Rebecca Whan, said the federal government response to the floods that hit the Tweed had been “appalling” and she was “shocked” no additional funding had been offered. “I know so many people who’ve lost their business, their home and their car,” Whan said. “They’re still reeling, half the people are still in shock trying to process the enormity of this. It’s literally like a war zone.” Whan described the joint state and commonwealth response as a “big monster with no heads”. “The disorganisation and lack of communication and coordination is beyond belief let alone the financial side of things,” she said. “It’s causing a lot of emotional stress … people are literally homeless. Right now, people need cash in their pocket, they’ve literally got nothing. “It’s a morale boost more than anything. They had the 2017 record breaking flood, the drought, bushfires, the pandemic, border closures, now this. They don’t have anything left.” The additional weekly disaster recovery payments will be automatically paid for individuals in the “catastrophe zones” that have already received initial funding. They will be made from 15 and 22 March. Eligible adults will receive $3,000 in total with children to get $1,200. The federal MP for Richmond, Justine Elliot, said it was “disgusting” and “astounding” the prime minister had excluded three nearby shires still reeling after devastating floods. Her electorate covers Tweed and Richmond in the north and Byron and parts of Ballina in the south. The electorate of Page covers the rest of Ballina, Lismore and the Richmond Valley, and has been held by Nationals MP Kevin Hogan since 2013. Elliot said “thousands” of people in her electorate lacked access to a home, food or money. “There’s a big humanitarian crisis,” she said. “It’s really insulting we don’t get that [extra money], we definitely need … much more than what they’ve put forward, it is really dire and it’s been a complete failure of the state and federal government. “We have people here with nowhere to live. It’s quite frankly disgusting.” Elliot said the floods had destroyed homes and businesses from Tweed heads down to Ballina, yet some of her constituents still hadn’t received the initial disaster payment. “I’ve had a lot of people that have had difficulties if they don’t have identification, which is just crazy,” she said. “The government is making it so hard. Our most urgent need is housing, food and money. A lot of people have been very distressed.” JUST IN: Scott Morrison has announced that Ballina, Byron and Tweed Shire residents will NOT be able to access the federal government’s additional disaster payments.This is an outrage and I am calling for this to be extended to ALL of us.#auspol #Floods2022 The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, told ABC’s 7.30 program on Wednesday evening he didn’t think “for one second” payments were being withheld from certain electorates because of the way they voted. “Obviously Lismore, from media reports alone, has been an epicentre, not just for the area, but for the nation,” Joyce said. “I find it obnoxious people would infer … a Labor person would not look after a National seat or Nationals would not look after a Labor seat. “People don’t die because of grants. People are not homeless because of grants. This is about an emergency and we don’t go through and say we’ll save this person’s life but not that person’s life.” The Byron shire council mayor, Michael Lyon, said he hadn’t seen the details of the funding, but the shire was facing “major infrastructure issues” that would cost upwards of $100m to repair. “Many of our community have lost everything,” he said. “The initial package isn’t enough so I’m surprised we aren’t included in this.” Flood ruined carpet, bedding, clothing, carpet, white goods and cars line our streets. Mullumbimby pic.twitter.com/EXhCJkezqK The Tweed council mayor, Chris Cherry, said leaving out Tweed and neighbouring Byron and Ballina from additional support could only be “an honest mistake”. “We look forward to the prime minister visiting our affected communities as soon as he can to see the sheer devastation of our shire for himself,” Cherry said. “We may not have received the national coverage other regions have, but many thousands of homes were inundated and we have lost two community members in the disaster. “The damage to our roads and infrastructure is catastrophic and will take years to recover with an excessive damage bill.” Locals took to social media to express their outrage at missing out despite losing their homes and livelihoods. “There are still so many waiting for the original payment to be processed, so far it’s a lot of empty promises,” one person wrote on Facebook. “Absolutely a kick in the guts for these people who have lost everything,” another said. On Wednesday Morrison declared a national emergency covering the severe weather and flooding across New South Wales and Queensland. The power to make the declaration was introduced after the Black Summer bushfires to minimise bureaucracy when recovering from an extreme event. The federal government has paid out $385.2m in disaster payments to 330,900 people in NSW and Queensland during the current floods crisis. One Lismore resident who talked with the prime minister when he visited the flood-stricken area said people had been too harsh regarding the government response. Morrison, the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, Senator Bridget McKenzie and local member Kevin Hogan visited Paul Weir and his family who lost about 150 cows in the floods. Reporters were not invited. Other locals were angry they didn’t get to see the PM but Weir said many were “unjustifiable critics”. “I don’t want to go against my community but realistically it was beyond any other flood we had in history. There’s nothing we could have done or could have prepared, realistically, for what’s happened,” he said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Some in the community have questioned why it took nine days for Morrison to declare the situation a national emergency. Many had to be rescued by local volunteers. But Weir said his meeting with Morrison “was actually really good”. “The first thing he asked was how I was going as a person, at times like this it is tough,” Weir said. “There was no media, just a private meeting with them and my immediate family. We could have a good discussion to put our views to them and say what happened to us and what we can see in our community. “I certainly did feel heard. I really did appreciate them taking their time out of their busy schedule with myself and my family.”",News/Australia news,‘It’s really insulting’: NSW flood victims excluded from extra disaster payments lash out at Coalition,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/10/its-really-insulting-nsw-flood-victims-excluded-from-extra-disaster-payments-lash-out-at-coalition
3/10/2022,"Families have voiced “huge frustration” after publication of the final report into the biggest maternity scandal in the NHS was delayed for a second time. The Ockenden review investigated 1,862 maternity cases at Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust in which mothers and babies may have been harmed over almost 20 years, and was due to be published on 22 March, having been delayed from December. This week senior midwife Donna Ockenden, who is leading the review, wrote to families to say publication had been delayed again due to “parliamentary processes” that still need to take place, and a new date has yet to be confirmed. “It’s hugely frustrating. I can’t really articulate it, it just feels awful. We’ve had this date ahead of us, everyone’s lives are on hold and we’re holding our breath to finally get this report,” said Rhiannon Davies, whose daughter Kate Stanton-Davies died under the care of the trust shortly after she was born in 2009. “People have booked time off work because emotionally it’s a huge thing. Treating the families like this, and treating Donna like this after all the work she’s done, it’s just disrespectful.” Davies and her partner Richard Stanton have campaigned for the review for years alongside Kayleigh and Colin Griffiths, whose daughter Pippa died in 2016 after contracting an infection during birth. In a written statement to parliament on Tuesday, the patient safety minister, Maria Caulfield, said the NHS is in the process of securing indemnity cover for potential legal action following the publication of the report. Davies said many families were sceptical about the reasons behind the delay. “I’m pretty sure it’s going to be a very damning report and there are a lot of people squirming in positions of power at the moment. This delay will not prevent the truth from coming out, no matter what the reason is behind it,” Davies said. “All the families have been, in effect, psyching ourselves up for what we would finally hear on that day,” said Charlotte Cheshire, whose 10-year-old son Adam was left with severe disabilities after staff failed to administer antibiotics for seven hours when he caught an infection during birth. “All the families involved in this inquiry, either their children have died or they’ve been dreadfully injured and left disabled. These are big, emotional situations that we’re dealing with. This report has been years in the making, everyone has had time to make the arrangements that needed to be made. “This delay leaves us angry, disappointed, upset and triggers the grief all over again.” The review was commissioned by health secretary Jeremy Hunt in 2017 to examine an initial 23 cases. Ockenden’s interim report, published in December 2020, uncovered a pattern of failures at the trust, including a lethal reluctance to conduct caesarean sections and a tendency to blame mothers for problems. “My son’s birthday is next week, he would have been seven. That’s seven years without a sorry from the hospital,” said Hayley Matthews, whose son Jack Burn died 11 hours after he was born in 2015. “You want justice for your own, but you also want change. I can’t bring my son back, but hopefully this review will help other families, stop it from happening again. But until we see this report, everyone is in the dark.” A spokesperson for the Ockenden review said: “We have been informed that a number of parliamentary processes are required before the final report can be published in parliament. The Department of Health and Social Care are working to have these arrangements in place so we can publish the report at the earliest opportunity. These parliamentary processes are completely beyond the control of the review team.” A DHSC spokesperson said: “We are committed to getting the families the answers they deserve and our sympathies remain with all those affected. “We continue to work with the Ockenden review team and NHS England and NHS Improvement to ensure the final report is published at the earliest opportunity.”",News/Society,Families ‘frustrated’ at delay in publication of maternity scandal report,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/09/maternity-scandal-report-shrewsbury-telford-nhs-trust
