4/24/2022,"It seems apt that Journey’s song Don’t Stop Believin’ gets an airing on board Forest Green Rovers’ electric coach, as it quietly eats up the final mile of the trip to Memorial Stadium on Saturday, three hours before the Gloucestershire side cement promotion to League One with a 0-0 draw at Bristol Rovers, becoming the smallest club to reach the division. Forty years after lifting the FA Vase against Rainworth Miners Welfare and toasting promotion from the Hellenic League Premier Division, the ninth tier of English football, Forest Green will soon be preparing to host Derby, Ipswich and Portsmouth. The goalkeeping coach, Dan Connor, is the unofficial DJ and controls a diverse playlist that ranges from Rihanna to Fleetwood Mac and Outkast. “I’m open to requests on the way back,” he says, smiling. Rob Edwards, the impressive Forest Green head coach, the head of football operations, James Mooney, Connor and three of the team’s locally based players – Dom Bernard, Kane Wilson and Josh March – are among the first to board the coach just before 10.30am for what is a historic journey: Forest Green are the first team in the world to travel to a sporting event in a zero-emissions vehicle. “Let’s go,” says Edwards as the coach pulls out of Another Way before snaking through Nailsworth, a town home to about 7,000 people, the colourful Saturday farmers’ market in full flow. The topic of conversation equally takes many twists and turns, from Tyson Fury’s fight against Dillian Whyte, Clint Eastwood and even vacuums, as we pass Dodington Park estate, which is owned by James Dyson. The rest of the squad, all wearing recyclable tracksuits, some players carrying reusable water bottles, get on at a hotel on the outskirts of Bristol after watching the start of Arsenal v Manchester United while eating lunch; baked potato, beans on toast, vegan bolognese, fruit and soya-based yoghurt are among the options. On longer away trips, they sometimes stock up at a falafel van in a lay-by off the M5. Apple crumble is another favourite among the players. “We had a roast yesterday,” the goalkeeper Luke McGee says. “It would have been the first time a lot of the lads would have had Quorn log. They were all looking at it like ‘hmm’ and I was like ‘trust me, have a bite and you’ll be having it’ and they all polished it off their plates.” When they board the coach at 1.10pm Edwards’s message from the pre-match meeting is fresh. “You’ve got to die before the ball goes in the back of the net today,” he says. “You’re in an unbelievable position. [It is a] fantastic day for us. Go and enjoy it. Go and make the most of it … stick together. I wish you all the best.” Wilson says the players have been ribbing Andy, the regular Forest Green coach driver who has been relegated to driving the supporters’ coach, that he has been dropped for the day. The 48-seat electric coach is manufactured by the Chinese firm Yutong and would cost more than £325,000 to buy. Forest Green have hired the bus from Westway Coaches, which has transported the royal family for several years. The coach has a range of about 200 miles and the battery takes two hours to charge. The driver, Jamie Thomson, counts Bill Gates as his most high-profile passenger, after taking him from the British Museum to Windsor Castle under police escort. “This is the future,” Thomson says. Never has so much commotion surrounded a bus. Camera crews hover and supporters linger as Dale Vince, the owner, gives a thumbs-up on arrival. In stark contrast, non-league Stockport County recently flew to Eastleigh and last year Manchester United made the 100-mile trip to Leicester by plane. But Forest Green are wedded to their beliefs and plan to acquire an electric coach to travel to some games next season. Edwards, Henry Staelens, the chief executive, and the kit man, drive electric cars. “This is the last piece of the jigsaw for us,” Vince says from the front of the bus. “The way our team travels is probably the biggest thing within our control that we hadn’t yet dealt with. Beyond that the really big thing we’re going to do is move to Eco Park, [a new stadium] built from wood, which has the lowest carbon footprint of any material in the world. It is good to be pushing the boundaries, otherwise you get a lot of box-ticking.” Last week the club received permission to start building their training complex, which will be a hub for the men’s, women’s and academy teams. Nestled in the Cotswolds, the club who play on an organic pitch perched at the top of Spring Hill is making a big impression, and not for the first time. At the final whistle, Forest Green supporters flood the Bristol Rovers pitch and a couple of dozen of home fans bedecked in St George’s fancy dress decide to join them. The hosts recognise an opportune moment to put on the sprinklers as March is carried aloft by joyous supporters. Dan Sweeney hijacks a television interview to hoist his manager on to his shoulders. Matty Stevens, their leading goalscorer who will undergo surgery on a cruciate ligament injury on Wednesday, is part of the celebrations. Edwards heads back down the tunnel, his grey jumper soaked in champagne. Half an hour after the final whistle, Tom Huelin, the fitness coach who oversees nutrition, sports science and, crucially, “food logistics” carries a towering stack of pizzas topped with jackfruit and vegan cheese into a humid away dressing room. Rice and pea protein shakes are also available. “In the old days, I was on the bus and it was: ‘Tom, can I have a protein shake?’” Huelin says. “Yeah, two scoops, shake it up, there’s powder and water flying everywhere, the driver is going mad.” Joey Barton pops his head in to congratulate the Forest Green squad, dance music blaring from a giant speaker. Sweeney gives an impromptu speech. “I’ve never seen a club like this, pulling in the same direction like we have … congratulations to everyone, this is going to live with us for ever.” Ebou Adams is the last player to leave the pitch. Jamille Matt speaks to his loved ones after decking down on halfway and Jordan Moore-Taylor phones his family. A local reporter cries happy tears. Edwards speaks on FaceTime to his wife and children, who watched the game on iFollow. “The Vengabus is coming,” Connor sings. In other words, it is 6.26pm and time to exit the executive suite in the West Stand. A few fans have waited in the car park to congratulate players and staff. Adams and Matt are only too happy to pose for photos. “Dan, can we have some tunes on?” comes the first question once everyone is on board. Tiesto’s Let’s Get Down to Business is one of the first up; on Tuesday they travel to Swindon hoping to wrap up the League Two title. “It has been a long journey and time where we have been top,” Edwards says. “We want to see it out.” “We’re on our way, on our way, to League One, we’re on our way,” soon emanates from the back of the coach as some players bang the headrests to increase the volume. Bernard leads a singalong. “Everywhere we go-o, people want to know-o,” he begins and his teammates obligingly follow. At the front, Edwards and his assistant, Richie Kyle, watch a couple of highlights from the game before making sense of scores elsewhere. By the time everyone empties the coach – players plot a night out in Cheltenham in between embracing Vince, Mooney and serenading Baily Cargill – there is 44% remaining on the battery and Thomson is thinking about recharging at Leigh Delamere services en route back. The match itself is electric. The marauding wing-back Wilson, arguably the division’s standout player, is the catalyst for their first meaningful attack with a jinking run and two minutes later Regan Hendry has a shot cleared off the line. Adams then forces the Bristol Rovers goalkeeper James Belshaw into a one-handed save. Matt, Jack Aitchison and Nicky Cadden are denied by Belshaw before McGee tips a curling shot by Luke Thomas round a post as the game drew towards a nervy crescendo. “We are going up,” the 737 visiting supporters sing with gusto, the minutes ticking down before McGee makes another stunning save to secure a point – and promotion – deep into stoppage time. “That last bit is hard but that feeling when the whistle goes almost makes all of the hell worth it,” Edwards says, laughing.",Sport/Football,Forest Green Rovers’ electric ambition fuels promotion to League One | Ben Fisher,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/24/forest-green-rovers-electric-ambition-fuels-promotion-to-league-one

4/24/2022,"Buying wine on a budget can be an enervating experience. It’s fraught with that dreary and all-too-common modern British emotion, the fear of being had, while rarely providing the flipside: a cheeky endorphin hit from knowing for sure that you’ve got a good deal. The problem starts with a certain lack of transparency that comes with the sheer proliferation of different wine brands and the fuzziness of their nomenclature. This is a market where two wines from the same place and with more or less indistinguishable packaging can easily have price tags at the opposite ends of a spectrum running from £3.99 to several thousand pounds. Many retailers trade on this ambiguity. It’s certainly the fuel for the kind of voucher offers and discount codes you find falling out of magazines or clogging up your in-box: those introductory cases that promise three-figure “savings”. Because the wines are “exclusives”, there’s no means of comparing the price with a rival retailer. But their nominal pre-discount price can be inflated far beyond their real worth. I’ve yet to taste a voucher-offer wine that’s made me think I’ve come out up on the deal. Chasing deals is generally a mug’s game if you want to get real vinous value for money, as opposed to the illusion of a saving, or simply finding the cheapest wine on display. The exceptions are the kind of blanket 5% or 10% savings you find on case sales at most independent and online retailers – even those that don’t advertise a discount are generally open to discussion if you ask – and the frequent 25% off everything “wine festivals” at supermarkets. Indeed, if you can afford the upfront cost, buying your wine in bulk makes a lot of sense. At Majestic, whose range has much improved over the past couple of years, the differential between the six-bottle and single-bottle price means you’d be silly to do anything else. If you buy a lot of wine, paying the annual subscription to a wine price comparison website might also help you save in the long run. The market leader, wine-searcher.com, has an impressive database of retailers but only really comes into its own also if you go beyond the free service. It would be a mistake to concentrate only on the immediate price. In the long run, some retailers that charge a few pence more on a bottle might actually provide better value, if measured strictly according to units of pleasure per pound. Tapping into the expertise you find at a good independent merchant is the best way to ensure you buy a wine you actually like a lot, and avoiding something you’d rather pour down the sink. A likelihood that will only increase the more they get to know you and your tastes. The same is true at a restaurant with a good sommelier. If you give them a strict upper limit on price and tell them some things you’ve liked in the past, there’s a good chance they’ll find you a wine you’ll enjoy – a pleasure that will only be enhanced by avoiding the Russian roulette of braving the wine list all by yourself. BEST BUYAspri Petra Greek Assyrtiko Florina, Greece 2021 (£6.99, Aldi)A lot of the range at both Aldi and Lidl falls into the “drinkably affordable”, rather than “brilliant value” category. This Greek white is definitely an example of the latter: dry and blisteringly fresh it positively shimmers with seafood-friendly lemony fruit. Co-op Irresistible Leyda Valley Sauvignon Blanc Leyda Valley, Chile (£7.50, the Co-op)The Co-op has some really good wines in the £7 to £10 area, with its Chilean range particularly strong on value, not least in this effortlessly lime and peapod-scented sauvignon from the Pacific Ocean-cooled vines of Leyda. Tanners Douro Red Douro, Portugal 2019 (£9.50, tanners-wines.co.uk)A good example of the kind of value you can find in independent wine merchants: yes, there are cheaper examples of unfortified red wines from the home of port. But, pound for pound, none offer more joyous, dark-fruited succulence than this. Pepe Mendoza Mares de Luz Monastrell Giro Alicante, Spain 2019 (£9.75, thewinesociety.com)Sourced by one of the UK’s best-value wine retailers, this south-eastern Spanish red is full of local character, charm and solar-powered vibrancy, with brightly aromatic, plumply juicy blackberry fruit, Mediterranean herb and pepper seasoning, and a satisfyingly chewy finish. Château de Pennautier Marquis de Pennautier Chardonnay-Viognier IGP Pays d’Oc, France 2021 (£11.99, or £6.99 as part of a mixed case of six, majestic.co.uk)I wonder how many people have snapped up this southern French dry white for the single-bottle price? There’s a lot more exciting stuff in Majestic’s range at that cost; but as part of a mixed case, seven quid is more than reasonable for a zesty-peachy all-rounder. Edoardo Miroglio Soli Pinot Noir Thracian Valley, Bulgaria 2019 (from £12.95, swig.co.uk; robersonwine.com)The combination of good producer (Edoardo Miroglio) and underrated wine region (Bulgaria) is one of the most fruitful ways of finding value in wine: this red is gloriously slinky and prettily perfumed in a way that is more than a match for many pinots several times the price.",Lifestyle/Food,How to find wines that give the best value for money,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/apr/24/how-to-find-wines-that-give-the-best-value-for-money
4/24/2022,"Is there a human predisposition to a 4/4 beat in music? And if so why? Or does 4/4 just feel more natural to me because I grew up with pop/rock as the standard music form? Michael Cameron-Mowat Send new questions to nq@theguardian.com. Limit ourselves to only Europe, and from Irish jigs to mazurkas or waltzes or a flamenco compas or a Transylvanian învârtita to the Macedonian eleno mome, the question a Martian might ask is: “Why is hardly any Earth music in 4/4?” BrendasIronSledge Anyone who listens to prog knows that if it ain’t in 13/8 (or would that be alternating bars of 3/4 and 7/8?) then it ain’t music. John Watson I think it is cultural, rather than inherent. Go back to the 15th and 16th centuries in Europe when the influence of the Christian church was very strong and much music was in 3/4, with the three reflecting the holy trinity of father, son and holy ghost. The C that is often printed on scores nowadays to mean common time (4/4) is in fact a broken circle and was known as imperfect time, whereas a full circle indicated perfect time, which we would today write as 3/4. Mark Bush, Milton Keynes Dance music in 19th-century Britain and America was often in 6/8 time, and songs were quite often ballads with no strong beats at all. Waltzes in 3/4 were also popular, right through to the 1930s. A perusal of recordings of world music will show any listener that a wide variety of music has greater depth and more interesting meters, melodies, harmonies, timbres, acoustic instruments, rhythmic and personal interaction than any recent example of commercial music. Matthew de Lacey Davidson I suspect it’s because the rhythm is iambic – like the English language. Der-duh of the 4/4 is the same as the heartbeat, the opening of the door to the home and the clunking of the pump on the bar. Helen Johnson Logic suggests there must be a human predisposition to a 4/4 beat because in music where this is in the composition it either tunes into one’s own natural heart rhythm, or causes it to increase in time with it. This was further emphasised in a medical context with the campaign of giving first aid chest compressions using the aptly chosen Bee Gees song Stayin’ Alive. Peter Lacey, Eastbourne The question assumes that “beat” means the same thing in every music culture. Beat is generally understood as a discrete point in time in western musical thought, and time is measured by the succession of beats. In traditional south Asian musical thought, for example, time is measured by matra, the space between “beats”. Time is experienced as a flow rather than a series of discrete events. So asking the question “Is 4/4 universal?” then becomes as meaningful, and culturally relevant, as asking what ragas are most commonly used in popular music? Diversity of musical thought makes the world a better place. WhatWouldIKnow In Irish music the most common time signatures are 4/4 for reels and 6/8 for jigs. You can get some strong, driving rhythms going with a fast reel, but for dance music you can’t beat the bounce of a 6/8 jig. Siglo2 It’s more of a western disposition if anything – lots of Turkish, Greek and Indian music is in odd times such as 9/8. drunkandskint There may be cultural preferences but it isn’t a human predisposition. African drumming, as an example, often favours 3/2. tcschultz I think there is definitely a predisposition for 4/4 or 2/4 timing as this is the natural pace of walking and marching. I would say that the rhythm is definitely inbuilt in humans as this is how this timing would have developed – you can imagine people walking together and making up songs as they went. Ruth Bradbury I think the answer is very simply because we have two legs and two arms, making it feel natural to respond to 4/4, or 2/4 even more so. Carole Franklin You ever tried walking to Paranoid Android? The beat changes really throw you off your pace. Brian Fleming Waltz rhythm is my beat, and I sense the world lives in three-quarter time. Jean Jackson, Guelph The prevalence of polyrhythms in folk music around the world is proof enough that there is no fundamental human predisposition to 4/4. Rhythm, as any drummer knows, is naturalised through exposure and practice; rhythmic forms are products of nurture, not nature. Ryan Whyte, Toronto Duple time is predominant throughout the western musical tradition, not just in pop music. 4/4 is duple time with every subdivision being duple as well. Why? It’s the simplest time pattern, just a downbeat and an upbeat, and it turns out that the simpler the pattern, the more flexible it is, and the more you can do with it. Triple times, or times with a triple division at some level, just intrude that little bit more, taking your attention from the music and making it more about the time pattern, and more so again for complex patterns, 7-time and the like. Perhaps you could call it a mathematical rather than a human predisposition. Gareth Adamson, London As a songwriter, I can only write my (three-minute pop) songs while walking. The cadence of my steps often gets me in a semi-trance, which leads to the brain working differently, less concerned with mundane matters. I figure, since I only have two feet, this leads to a natural tendency to write in a 4/4 or 2/4 time signature. The few waltzes curiously weren’t written while walking. Bent Van Looy, Antwerp I believe the answer lies somewhere in the middle. Time signatures like 4/4 and 3/4 have a natural flow to them that is easily recognised by the brain. Throughout the history of modern pop/rock music there has been a focus on what patterns will have the most impact on listeners and since then it has been a snowball effect. Since audiences generally don’t hear different time signatures, they are less likely to appreciate them when they are heard or even be able to follow along without specifically being told how to count. But there are easily recognisable rhythms in 5/4 or 7/4 … the listener just needs to be open to adapting to the flow. David Klein Music and dance developed simultaneously in early humans. Most humans have two feet (homo duopolis) and preference for dance steps inevitably developed to suit that. It follows that multiples of two (feet) became popular, including two x two (four-beat dance pattern).This has become ingrained into modern music culture along with grunting noises and head-swinging. The simian subclass relinquished the habit millions of years ago. Some branches of humanity obviously started off with three feet and developed preferences for 3/4 or 3/8 if the music happened to be fast. This preference is still found today in Irish dancing (homo incomprehensis), which is an ancient throwback to when that particular branch had an uneven number of feet. This particular dancing prefers 6/8 due to its speed. Some country dancing found in the western counties of England also have a preference for a 6/8 rhythm when stimulated by scrumpy, a local narcotic. There is some evidence in the fossil record of an ancient five-legged offshoot. This line (homo brubecinus) died off very early due to being unable to stand up properly for more than five minutes. In summary, the human race is stuck with the 4/4 preference until we grow more feet. There are encouraging early signs of this in Canberra, Australia.

4/24/2022,"Iam a queer/bisexual/pansexual woman. I haven’t chosen a label – I’m only a few years in, so I’m still learning all the big gay ropes. I live with my six-year-old son and my girlfriend. We’re engaged but “fiancee” doesn’t sit right with me – I find it impossible to say without doing a funny voice. So we refer to each other as “nearly wife”. My son also has his excellent dad, who co-parents the absolute socks off him. Something rewired in my early 30s: I went from blissfully uncomplicated straightness to getting crushes on womxn. A few years on and I’m due to marry one. I’m wildly lucky. I’ve yet to be verbally abused, ever. It helps that I’m a proud resident of Lewisham, south-east London, one of the biggest, brightest and most brilliant diversity jumble sales on the planet. My son’s “express your culture” day at school looked like an unrealistically utopian Argos advert. There was everything from saris, kimonos and Ankara churchwear to Romanian football kit and, in great news for everyone, even a tiny Dutch milkmaid. It’s a right old mashup and it’s beautiful. Also, I’m old. Not usually a coup but I really believe not being straight must be harder when you’re a child (ie under 30). Children’s self-worth hinges on how they are perceived by others, whereas at my age you care far less what anyone makes of you. Disown me if you like, Auntie Karen: I couldn’t give a monkey’s. So far I’ve largely been able to ride on the coattails of the activism and sacrifice of historical warriors for LGBT+ equality. I could have been forgiven for thinking we had arrived at the promised land. Spoiler alert: we haven’t. This week a leaflet for the local mayoral election landed on my doorstep. Which is also the doorstep of my son, who can read. One of the candidates, Maureen, has a six-point plan. Five of the points are quite bog standard. She has had enough of fly-tipping. Haven’t we all, Maureen, haven’t we all? And she would love a tax cut or two. Each to their own, Maureen, each to their own. But casually nestled between these two proposals is this: Marriage: I pledge to cut through political correctness and simply state the truth that natural marriage between a man and a woman is the fundamental building block for a successful society, and the safest environment for raising children. Then she’s back into explaining that if we only upcycled more, we could all save a few quid. Wow, Maureen. I think there’s quite a sharp needle in your haystack there, babe. It took me a while to realise how upset I was. It’s the implication that my son isn’t safe with me, because of my lack of straightness. What if he reads that? What if someone relays that to him in the playground? That same glorious playground full of pint-sized thobes, yarmulkes and Yankees baseball caps. That breaks my heart and terrifies me. And in 2022, it’s shocking. I would put it to you, Maureen, that the only children who aren’t safe in this scenario are the queer ones born into families with your hate-laden views. It raises the practical question: are we allowed to post those opinions through a letterbox? My partner and I asked the internet, via social media. A small storm ensued, so spicy that my partner deleted her tweet. It was too all-consuming. I’m, however, cracking on. The 2% saying it’s freedom of speech: surely, not when it’s hate speech? Through a door directly, inevitably, to the children of queer families? Maureen thinks she’s protecting children, but she’s harming some. Lewisham council replied, in effect, that candidates can state whatever opinions they like. Which I get. But really, with zero boundaries? There’s freedom of speech, and there’s freedom of hate speech, and there has to be some demarcation between the two. It’s the difference between shaking hands and punching. No freedoms are absolute because we’re bound by standards of basic respectfulness. It’s a shame, actually, because I really would have loved something to be done about the fly-tipping.

4/24/2022,"When the rumours started that Ed Balls was eyeing a comeback as an MP, the reaction from most people in Westminster was “why would he bother doing that?” Labour’s former shadow chancellor has forged a fun career for himself since unexpectedly losing his Morley and Outwood seat in 2015; enjoying the Strictly Come Dancing limelight, writing a cookery book and presenting documentaries. He has looked visibly happier and healthier since losing his seat. Why on earth would he come back to being an MP, with all the misery that entails?The answer in Balls’ case is probably the same as it is for many in politics: it’s an addiction. That’s why politicians are happy to put up with a dysfunctional parliamentary culture, the weird working hours (and weird colleagues) and people generally disliking them. His wife, Yvette Cooper, is still a Labour MP and flying high in the party, so it won’t be a surprise to Balls if life hasn’t really improved since he was last on the green benches. In many ways it has got worse, to the extent that only addicts will find the life attractive, while outsiders, who might still make very good legislators, stay well away.Members of the public repeatedly tell pollsters that they’d be interested in becoming an MP (the latest poll, from YouGov in February of this year, puts the proportion at 21%). But on the basis of the sort of people who end up actually becoming MPs, I wonder whether this poll is similar to those showing that one in eight men think they’d probably win a point in a tennis match against Serena Williams, in that it doesn’t bear much relation to what would really happen. In these polls about whether they’d like to stand for parliament, people then make it very clear they’ve noticed the downsides of the job that would put them off: online abuse and the impact on their family tend to be the reasons most cite for not wanting to enter parliament. When I interviewed MPs who were standing down at the 2019 election, they also mentioned these as factors in their decisions to quit, often after a reasonably short time in office. Of the 74 MPs who stood down, 21 did so after just nine or fewer years in office. Women were far more likely to leave early than men: 52% of women leaving had served nine years or fewer, with just 25% of men doing the same. Some said they’d always imagined just being in the Commons for a decade. Others had burned out in a way they hadn’t expected, thanks to the pressures of combining life in parliament, a constituency and fitting a family in between. Threats and abuse just made that balance seem less justifiable. This month, senior Labour MP Chris Bryant warned that the reputation of parliament itself is being tarnished by the behaviour of some of its occupants. He worries that MPs are in so much danger (two members have been murdered in the past six years and others are wearing stab vests for their own protection) that the reputation of parliament is all the more precious. After Sir David Amess’s murder, a number of members stopped holding face-to-face constituency surgeries because their family members had begged them to, fearful that they might be next. Even before Amess’s death, personal safety drove many members to wonder if this job really was worth it. It was certainly a key factor for many of those who decided to quit early. The 10-year MP makes sense on a personal level. But it does mean that parliament loses experience and wisdom, not to mention people who have only just worked out their way around the building. Politicians often repeat the mistakes of the past – the level of turnover in parliament makes it even more likely that no one will notice. At least those MPs made it into parliament at all. When I wrote my book Why We Get the Wrong Politicians in 2018, I found that the greatest barrier to us getting the right MPs was the sheer cost of standing for parliament. Even if you’d make a great legislator, even if you’d really like to be in Westminster representing your local area, you’d likely be put off by what I found: the personal cost of being a parliamentary candidate in the 2015 election was £11,118 – and the costs tripled if you were standing in a marginal seat where you had a chance of taking it off another party. Personal costs for Tories who won in marginal seats were astronomical, and even those who didn’t win still took a £18,701 hit in lost earnings by working for a couple of years for free, in housing costs, transport and so on. Labour candidates in marginal seats spent an average of £19,022 to win and the considerably higher sum of £35,843 on average to lose. Their successful safe seat colleagues still lost £13,617 on average. The 2015 election was the last vaguely normal election, in that the parties knew when it was and had been preparing for it several years out. The 2017 and 2019 snap elections cost candidates much less – but many of those who had failed narrowly in 2015 turned down the offer of standing again in these snap elections, because they were still paying back their debts from the last go. We don’t know the precise date of the next election, because the Fixed-term Parliaments Act has been abolished – but the parties are already selecting candidates and getting them embedded in key seats. Those wannabe MPs better have deep pockets. Why does this matter? If you’re mug enough to stand for parliament, then no one will shed a tear for the money you choose to spend trying to get through the longest and most expensive job interview in the world. But the cost means that many people simply cannot afford to stand for parliament, even if they’d make much better MPs than the ones who can. Since my book first came out, the main parties have made various moves to acknowledge the prohibitive costs, offering bursaries to a limited number of candidates from disadvantaged backgrounds. It is a relief they have recognised one of the barriers to improving politics that has so long just been accepted as the way things are. I fear now, though, that politicians are coming to accept a new normal of abuse and a miserable life that leads many of their best to quit, and still more to stay away. We are still getting the wrong politicians, and the ones we have are in many cases actively making things worse.

4/24/2022,"Each journey of bereavement is different, and few young, widowed mothers might pack their life into a Land Rover Defender and set off with a young daughter to drive through Africa for a year. Six years after her husband was fatally stabbed on their north London doorstep by a stranger in the grip of psychosis 11 days after she gave birth to their daughter, Fleur, Nadja Ensink-Teich sets off for Cape Town next week to do just that. Dr Jeroen Ensink, 41, a public health academic and internationally-renowned water engineer committed to improving access to water and sanitation in deprived areas, had popped out to post cards announcing the happy news of Fleur’s birth to family and friends when he was brutally killed days after Christmas in 2015. His killer was convicted of manslaughter. In that moment, the couple’s dreams of an adventure together in Asia and Africa continuing his development projects for the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) died with him. But, around the sixth anniversary of his death, and now living back in the Netherlands, where they were both from, Ensink-Teich, 43, spotted a sales advertisement for a fully equipped overlander Land Rover in Cape Town. “And, sometimes something pops up and you know you’ve got to go for it. So, I bought it,” she said. From Tuesday, she and Fleur, six, will set off on an odyssey, overlanding for a year through south and east Africa, visiting projects and people Jeroen worked with in Tanzania, Mozambique, Malawi and South Africa and also travelling through Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia. She aims to highlight the LSHTM Jeroen Ensink Memorial Fund, a scholarship set up in his name, and posting on her Instagram account Journey of a Widowed Mom The journey is also to bring Fleur closer to the essence of a father she, tragically, will never know, as well as to serve as another milestone on Ensink-Teich’s own journey of bereavement. In doing it, she is honouring a pledge she made to herself at that darkest time after his death, to live the fullest life possible for her and her daughter, “because I know life can stop, and at any second”. It’s not the first adventure for mother and daughter. Three years ago, after the exhausting process of Jeroen’s inquest where she found herself battling lawyers for the Metropolitan police over the circumstances leading up to the stabbing, they spent months travelling south-east Asia. During that time she found surprising inner strength, confronting her grief, but also overcoming challenges such as relying on the kindness of strangers when she fell seriously ill, alone and incapacitated in Cambodia, but which helped her regain trust in humanity. She spent Covid lockdowns at home in Holland writing a book, to be published by HarperCollins in September, about her personal experience. It is called ‘Dag lieverd, tot zo’ – which translated means “Bye love, see you soon” – her last words to her husband as he left their Islington flat. It was “a super-emotional journey, to go through everything. I cried a lot”, she said. “I hope people can relate to it, so they too can see there is a life worth living.” Lockdown was “terrifying”, she said. “The support network I had after Jeroen died, which is crucial in the healing process, just melted away. You can’t see anyone, you can’t hug anyone.” But lockdown also persuaded her, after online tutoring, that Fleur, who is fluent in three languages, would not be missing out. “I was stopping myself with all these excuses that I shouldn’t and couldn’t do this. And it came back to: ‘I’m going to stop thinking of obstacles, and think of opportunities’. Lockdown has shown just what is possible.” The Land Rover, nicknamed “Randy”, is equipped with tents, a kitchenette, solar panels, a water tank – everything needed to be self-sufficient. She and Fleur will travel with a female family friend, also bereaved, who has previously worked in Africa, “because I think this trip is really too big to do on my own”. She has rented out her home, and intends to continue working, as an online bereavement counsellor for widowed mothers from on the road. “All I need is an internet connection.” When he died, Jeroen was running a project in Malawi, and they had plans to live there, or in Nepal, for a couple of years. This is her recreating that in her own way. “A year is ambitious, but that is the plan,” she said. “It is my way to stay connected with Jeroen, with his projects, with his mission,” she said. Former colleagues and students he taught while working in Africa have already reached out to support her through the journey. She will meet so many who knew him, which is important for both her and Fleur. “And that is a way of keeping him alive. Because people only die when you stop talking about them,” she said.",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘A life worth living’: bereaved mother and daughter set off on year-long drive across Africa,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/24/a-life-worth-living-bereaved-mother-and-daughter-set-off-on-year-long-drive-across-africa
4/24/2022,"A superyacht seized from drug smugglers attempting to bring £160m worth of cocaine to the UK will be sold on behalf of the government in an online auction this week. Acting on a tipoff, Border Force and National Crime Agency officers intercepted and boarded the 120ft (37 metre) yacht in international waters near Guernsey last year. They discovered more than two tonnes of cocaine with an estimated street value of more than £160m. The MY Kahu was seized under the Proceeds of Crime Act, and will on Wednesday be put up for auction with the proceeds to be used to fund the NCA’s operations. The yacht, which has a large saloon, galley, five staterooms and accommodation for four crew, is expected to sell for several million pounds. The auctioneer, Mark Woods, said more than 25 parties had registered interest in buying the yacht, and several potential buyers viewed the MY Kahu during an open day in Torquay earlier this week. Woods said bidders had flown in from Greece, the south of France and even New Zealand. He said the New Zealand family are particularly interested in acquiring the MY Kahu because it was built in 1979 for the Royal New Zealand Navy. “It’s so rare that something like MY Kahu comes up for auction and she’s a wonderful vessel, so we look forward to seeing her in the hands of the highest bidder and being able to send the proceeds of sale to the government,” said Woods, government contracts manager at Wilsons Auctions. Woods, who specialises in selling confiscated assets, said the yacht was one of the most interesting items seized by the government under the Proceeds of Crime Act that he has sold. “We have sold all sorts of things seized under the act. This isn’t our first boat, but it’s one of the biggest,” he said. “We’ve also sold planes, gold bullion, high value jewellery and watches, cryptocurrency and even an Olympic gold medal-winning horse. Then there are the cars – Rolls-Royces, Lamborghinis, Ferraris, Bentleys. “You never know what you are going to be instructed to manage with seized assets and it really captures the imagination of the public when it comes to the auction. It’s quite the story.” Woods said the boat was in good condition, despite being raided and extensively searched by Border Force officers. “She went through a thorough search process when originally seized. However, after carrying out works, she is now well presented and ready for auction.” The yacht left Barbados in August 2021 and sailed across the Atlantic. It was intercepted 80 miles south of Plymouth by specialist officers from Border Force and the NCA, who raided the vessel. The drugs were discovered wrapped in hundreds of sealed packages distributed carefully across the vessel to avoid the weight leading the boat to list. At the time of the seizure the NCA said the cocaine would have “no doubt been sold on to communities in Britain”. Four men charged with drug smuggling in relation to the haul were cleared after a trial last month. The Crown Prosecution Service also dropped a similar charge against a fifth defendant. Andrew Cole, 33, of Norton Road, Stockton-on-Tees, has pleaded guilty to drug smuggling. He will be sentenced on 26 May. Bidding on the yacht starts at 3pm on 27 April, and closes at 3pm on 28 April.",News/World news,Superyacht seized with cocaine worth £160m to be sold at auction,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/24/superyacht-seized-with-cocaine-worth-160m-to-be-sold-at-auction
4/24/2022,"The former health secretary Matt Hancock was given an overnight stay at a country estate owned by the head of Randox, the healthcare firm that had hired the MP Owen Paterson as a consultant. During a two-day visit to Northern Ireland as health secretary in 2019, Hancock had a private dinner and stayed overnight at the Dundarave country estate in County Antrim, which is owned by Peter Fitzgerald, Randox’s founder. The overnight stay was disclosed in documents released under the Freedom of Information Act. It was not included in the official register of hospitality received by ministers. Through a spokesperson, Hancock said he did not need to declare the hospitality as he had not accepted it in a ministerial capacity. However, transparency campaigners disagreed and said there was a “clear expectation” that ministers should declare such hospitality and follow the spirit of the rules. Questions have been raised about the relationship between Randox and the Conservative party after the firm was awarded almost £500m of public funds during the Covid pandemic for testing. Randox also hired Paterson as a consultant, paying him £100,000 a year. Paterson resigned from parliament last year after he exploited his position as an MP to lobby for his clients, including Randox. Randox donated £160,000 to the Conservative party between 2010 and 2018. Paterson directly lobbied Hancock on behalf of Randox during the pandemic. After Paterson’s lobbying, Hancock chased his officials, saying he was “very worried” about how his department was treating Randox and other firms. During the Northern Ireland visit in 2019, Hancock met three firms, including Randox, that at that time were paying Paterson to be their consultant. Official documents obtained by Transparency International UK under the Freedom of Information Act suggest Paterson was partially involved in organising Hancock’s visit. They also show how Hancock was invited by Randox to have dinner and stay overnight at Fitzgerald’s Dundarave estate during his visit. The County Antrim estate is described as “magnificent … in a glorious setting” with “a fine Italianate mansion at its heart.” On 21 March 2019, Hancock toured Randox’s laboratories in Belfast. An email sent to the health department, which appears to have been written by a Randox employee, said: “Understand SoS [secretary of state] will be with us, Randox Science Park … Then SoS goes to other visits before joining us for a private dinner and overnight that evening.” On the same day, Hancock carried out a number of other official visits, including at Ulster hospital. He also attended a forum to discuss health and food. Two of the speakers were from Devenish, a firm that makes animal feed, and Lynn’s Country Foods, a firm that makes meat products. The two firms were at that time paying Paterson a total of £61,000 a year to be their consultant. The rules governing the conduct of ministers, known as the ministerial code, state that when politicians accept hospitality in a ministerial capacity, details should be made public through a register that is published regularly. Official guidance identifies dinners given by companies as the type of hospitality that should be declared if received in a ministerial capacity. Hancock’s spokesperson, James Davies, said there had been no need to declare the private dinner and overnight stay at the Randox founder’s estate because it was political rather than departmental. “Everything was declared properly and appropriately,” Davies said, adding that the relevant paragraphs of the ministerial code were “a departmental responsibility. If they judge an event political, then this doesn’t apply. Perhaps you should be speaking to [the Department of Health and Social Care], rather than Mr Hancock.” He continued: “Staying overnight is absolutely fine. It was a political dinner, and Mr Hancock met many [Northern Ireland] politicians including Robin Swann, another relationship that became critical in responding to the pandemic. It’s absurd to say there was anything wrong with this.” That interpretation of the rules was disputed by Rose Whiffen, a research officer at Transparency International UK, which obtained the documents. She said: “When ministers accept hospitality, especially from political donors, there is a clear expectation this should be declared and a matter of public record. “When a secretary of state is uncertain over whether they have to report being wined and dined under the ministerial code, it is always better for them to err on the side of caution and follow the overriding spirit of the rules by doing so.”",News/World news,Matt Hancock’s stay at mansion of Randox founder revealed by FoI request,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/24/matt-hancocks-stay-at-mansion-of-randox-founder-revealed-by-foi-request
4/24/2022,"“Just as every grief narrative is a reckoning with loss, every love story is a chronicle of finding,” writes Kathryn Schulz in her eloquent and tender memoir, Lost & Found. “And so, much as my father’s death made me wonder about the relationship between large losses and smaller ones, falling for someone made me think about what finding love has in common with the broader act of finding anything at all.” This is the deceptively simple premise of this slim book: losing and finding are such seemingly unremarkable elements of everyday life that we rarely pause to think about their significance, until, of course, it comes to losing and finding people, experiences that are among the most profound of our lives and that go to the heart of what it means to be human. Living through these life-changing moments in quick succession – she met her partner shortly before her father died – means Schulz is ideally placed to consider, through the prism of her own experience, the various ways people have tried to make sense of loss and discovery. Like her late father, she possesses a “panoptic curiosity”, drawing on cultural and artistic history, poetry, psychology, philosophy and scientific theory to examine what is at once universal yet intensely personal. There is no doubt, though, that for all the fascinating digressions into Meno’s paradox or theory of optimal search, our appetite for human stories makes the personal narrative the most compelling thread in the book. Schulz presents her losing and finding in reverse order, concentrating the first section on the death of her father, whose life encompassed its own catalogue of losses. He was born during the second world war, to a mother who, as the youngest of 11 siblings, had been sent to Tel Aviv from Poland to escape the fate of her remaining family, all of whom were sent to Auschwitz. By the time Isaac Schulz arrived in the US, at the age of 11, “he had lost, like Elizabeth Bishop, two cities and a continent, along with almost all of what should have been his family”. Schulz’s adoration of her polymath father shines through this section, in a way that can’t help but make the reader regret missing the chance to meet him: “He had a booming voice, a heavy accent, a formidable mind, a rabbinical beard, a Santa Claus belly and the gestural range of the Vitruvian Man.” Though she concedes that his death could not be defined objectively as a tragedy – he died at 74, surrounded by his loved ones, after a happy and fulfilled life – it is, inevitably, devastating to her. “It is true that, if you are lucky, there is a seam of sweetness and meaning to be found within it, a vein of silver in a dark cave a thousand feet underground. Still, the cave is a cave.” Readers familiar with Schulz’s journalism – she is a Pulitzer-winning staff writer for the New Yorker – will know her gift for the mot juste and she deploys it throughout the book in ways that offer us afresh these most shopworn of literary themes, love and death. Of her first encounter with C, the woman she will marry, she writes: “My heightened attention was akin to that of a climber in steep terrain: the peaks high and varied, the views vast and lovely and surprising.” The book is divided into three sections; the first two, “Lost” and “Found”, deal straightforwardly with grief and love respectively. The third act, like all good romances, ends with a wedding. This section, titled “And”, is more abstract, an attempt to analyse the meaning of conjunction through the literal joining together that marriage entails. It is in this final part that the book’s evolution from magazine essay is most apparent; there is a fair bit of stating the obvious and then bulking it out with numerous examples. But the conclusion is a breathtakingly beautiful set-piece, a celebration of the ordinariness and sublimity of our most fundamental connections: to parents, to children, to lovers, to the forward motion of life, which will inevitably entail loss. “Our crossing is a brief one,” she writes, “best spent bearing witness to all that we see: honouring what we find noble, tending what we know needs our care, recognising that we are inseparably connected to all of it, including what is not yet upon us, including what is already gone. We are here to keep watch, not to keep.”  Lost & Found by Kathryn Schulz is published by Picador (£14.99). To support the Guardian and Observer order your copy at guardianbookshop.com.
