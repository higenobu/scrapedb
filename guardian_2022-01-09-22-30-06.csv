1/9/2022,"Morrisons will remove “use by” dates from milk packaging at the end of the month in a bid to save millions of pints from being thrown away unnecessarily every year. The British supermarket is asking customers to use a simple and time-honoured test to work out if cow’s milk is usable: sniff it.  Bottles sold by the retailer will still carry “best before” dates that will give an indication of when the milk will have the best taste, but it can often still be used safely for several days after that point. The UK wastes about 330,000 tons of milk – 490m pints – every year, about 7% of total UK production, according to figures from 2018 from food waste charity Wrap. That makes it the third most-wasted food in the UK, behind potatoes and bread. Milk is also associated with high carbon emissions because of the large resources needed to feed cows. Increasing awareness of its carbon footprint has been one factor behind the rapid growth in plant-based alternatives such as oat, soy and almond “milks”. Morrisons said customers should check milk by holding the bottle to their nose. If it smells sour then it may have spoiled. If it has curdled and lumps have formed that is also a sign it should not be used. Milk’s life can be extended by keeping it cool, and keeping bottles closed as much as possible. Morrisons is the UK’s fourth-largest supermarket behind Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Asda with a 10.4% market share, according to data company Kantar. The move will initially cover 90% of the supermarket’s own-brand milks, including own-brand British and Scottish milks, Morrisons For Farmers milks, and Morrisons organic milks. The supermarket had already scrapped “use by” dates on some of its own-brand yoghurt and hard cheese ranges in 2020. Marcus Gover, Wrap’s chief executive, said: “I am delighted that Morrisons is the first UK supermarket to take this important step to help reduce household food waste – it shows real leadership and we look forward to more retailers reviewing date labels on their products and taking action.” Best practice guidelines drawn up by Wrap with the Food Standards Agency and the government say a “use by” date is only required for food safety reasons, which don’t apply for milk. Ian Goode, Morrisons’ senior milk buyer, said: “Wasted milk means wasted effort by our farmers and unnecessary carbon being released into the atmosphere. “Generations before us have always used the sniff test – and I believe we can too.”",News/Business,‘Use the sniff test’: Morrisons to scrap use by dates from milk packaging,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/09/use-the-sniff-test-morrisons-to-scrap-use-by-dates-from-milk-packaging
1/9/2022,"Jake Humphrey and Prof Damian HughesCornerstone, £20, pp304  Humphrey and Hughes’s popular podcast High Performance works so well because it makes successful people’s methods seem relatable and attainable. The book of the show is more than just excerpts from their best episodes. Instead, it’s one of those confidence-building self-help guides – using insight from guests such as Ant Middleton, Chris Hoy and Kelly Holmes – which focuses the mind on how to be your best, rather than the best. Pop psychology at its most obvious, but Humphrey and Hughes lay out some thought-provoking signposts to a more fruitful 2022. Raven LeilaniPan Macmillan, £9.99, pp240 (paperback) The concept is intriguing: Edie, a young, black, New York artist, moves into her white fortysomething lover’s marital home in the suburbs, with all the tensions an open marriage brings. Meanwhile, Leilani makes piercing observations on race, sex and 21st-century city life. Yet for all the fresh and vital writing, Luster adopts a more elegant tone when exploring Edie’s relationship with her art and her lover’s wife. An HBO television adaptation will start later this year; definitely one to watch. Amitava KumarPan Macmillan, £14.99, pp272 Early in Indian-American author Kumar’s achingly au courant third novel, his writer-narrator muses from an artists’ retreat that “with the rise of ‘alternative facts’, what did ‘fiction’ even mean?” It’s a question this book grapples with as it navigates Trump, the pandemic and India-Pakistan tensions through the prism of an author battling against fake news. Perhaps deliberately, this makes A Time Outside This Time less successful as a traditional novel with compelling characters and more an involving, long-form literary opinion piece. Kumar’s gamble just about pays off.  To order High Performance, Luster or A Time Outside This Time go to guardianbookshop.com.

1/9/2022,"Photo-reportage is said to have begun with a fire – specifically the great fire of Hamburg in 1842. German photographers Hermann Biow and Carl Ferdinand Stelzner hauled their cameras up to the top of a high building to capture the devastation below. The equipment weighed as much they did and the daguerreotype process was too slow to catch the flames in action. But their images of burnt-out buildings were seen around the world: epochal news photography. Fire is easy to start but historically hard to depict. Painting hardly manages it at all without freezing the flames, as it were. Of course there are exceptions – Turner’s wild watercolours of the Houses of Parliament burning down, dashed off in the scorching heat of the moment from a boat on the Thames – but even the two-dimensional medium of photography has some trouble recording fire’s spectacular speed, spread and volatility. Moving images generally hold the main advantage.  So it is fascinating to see how the 13 photographers shortlisted for the 2021 Prix Pictet handle its theme. The top international prize for photography and sustainability has chosen the fourth element, fire, after running through the previous three. This could hardly seem more timely, given the past year’s chain of devastating blazes, from the Amazonian rainforest to the Dixie fire in California, which torched almost a million acres, and the Australian bushfires growing wilder than ever last month. There is some documentary reportage here, of the California fires and of a burns hospital in Varanasi, its poverty-stricken patients generally the victims of domestic accidents involving paraffin lamps in India’s rural households. The South African photographer Brent Stirton, who works mainly for Getty, brings a tender eye to these portraits of teenagers whose brown skin flames white with flickering wounds, and of the plastic surgeon who serves the poor there singlehandedly. More than six million Indians are burned every year. The series is titled Burns Capital of the World. But his colleague Mak Remissa, of the European Pressphoto Agency, turns reportage upside down with his celebrated Left 3 Days series. These nearly monochrome photographs show the aftermath of the Khmer Rouge’s assault on Phnom Penh on 17 April 1975. Everyone was ordered to leave the city, including Remissa’s own family. His photographs show Cambodians desperately trying to find water, first aid or food in the smoking violence. Or so it seems. Close-up, these turn out to be tiny dioramas, the silhouetted figures scissored out of black paper and surrounded with the smoke of burning coconuts. The restaging amounts to a double commemoration, each poignant scene a photographic image but also an act of homage to the dead – who numbered his relatives. The memory of these atrocities is now fading away, Remissa has said, “like smoke being blown away by the wind”. Memory is also integral to the Wonder Beirut series by Lebanese artist duo Joana Hadjithomas and Khalil Joreige. Picture-perfect postcards of Beirut – glamorous hotels, innocent pleasure-seekers – are strategically blistered and burned. Buildings melt, seafront bars go up in pockmarked explosions, as if destroyed by real flames. Which they were, of course, during the Lebanese civil war; though such postcards are still on sale in Beirut, as if nothing ever happened. The artists collected, adapted and re-photographed them for this series. But history has intervened again. Many of their prints were destroyed in the colossal Beirut explosion in 2020. The more conceptual the work, the further it seems to depart from fire per se. The American artist Lisa Oppenheim doesn’t show flames at all. Her photographs look like magnificent cloudscapes out of Constable or Turner, until you consult the titles and realise these are found photographs newly cropped and solarised. Man holding large camera photographing a cataclysmic event, possibly a volcano erupting, 1908/2012 shows glorious sun-edged clouds. But the man is gone and so is the eruption. Time and amnesia have intervened. The solarisation is achieved with a simple lit match, diminutive counterpart of the original flames. The judges, led by Sir David King of the Centre for Climate Repair at Cambridge University, have chosen their shortlist from 300 portfolios. Some, like Oppenheim, are conceptual artists who use photography as material more than medium. Indeed, the most famous artist here is the Swiss-American Christian Marclay, best known for his enthralling 24-hour video The Clock, constructed out of cinematic fragments of characters interacting with clocks and time. His shortlisted collages are properly alarming, worked up from photographs of burning leaves and fiery outbreaks, plus screaming faces from graphic cartoons – a contrast so abrupt it is as if the collage itself was bursting into flames. But the winner of 2021’s prize is a photographer of such renown, it hardly needs further enlargement – the American Sally Mann, known for her disquieting monochrome scenes of civil war battlefields, decaying landscapes and her own intimate family life. Mann has won for lowering, old-fashioned tintypes – positive images made on metal plates – of the Great Dismal Swamp on the border of Virginia and North Carolina, where escaped slaves used to take refuge in the antebellum era. Wildfires have left this place even more desolate, a nightmare of black water, charred trees and bracken. Never averse to melodrama, Mann has shot branches that look like graveyard crosses and added deliberate sears and blemishes to her pictures so that they look even more apocalyptic. Yet they do not have the vision of upcoming Austrian-Nigerian artist David Uzochukwu’s picture of a young black woman, her hair seeming to smoulder with drifting smoke. The human head as a sign of the future: this is irreducibly subtle – no smoke without fire.

1/9/2022,"Plush offices, candlelit speakeasies and tasteful walled gardens; such cosy confines feel built for lovers. In Christian Schwochow’s handsome spy thriller, they are the clandestine meeting points for undercover agents. Set in 1938, in the run-up to the second world war, and based on Robert Harris’s 2017 historical novel, it stars a quietly dignified Jeremy Irons as prime minister Neville Chamberlain as he prepares to meet with Adolf Hitler (Ulrich Matthes) to discuss what would become the ill-fated Munich agreement. Advising, or rather, advising against, is George MacKay’s sombre political aide Hugh Legat, who in turn is fed information by former university pal Paul von Hartman (Jannis Niewöhner), now a German diplomat. MacKay is muted; his character is teased for his reserve, a quality he shares with the film. Niewöhner gives the sparkier performance, as a passionate German nationalist whose loyalty has flipped.

1/9/2022,"Boris Johnson’s former Brexit minister who quit last month has warned him to commit to low taxes and the free market or risk losing the next election, as the prime minister comes under continuing pressure from the Conservative right. David Frost, a former lobbyist whom Johnson made his chief Brexit negotiator and later gave a peerage, said in his first major interview since quitting as a cabinet minister that the Tories needed to “focus on rebuilding the nation and be proud of our history”.  Lord Frost resigned before Christmas, citing concerns about the direction of travel of the government, particularly over Covid rules. However, it also came at a difficult time for the UK’s negotiations with the EU, as it emerged that Britain was prepared to drop demands for EU judges to be stripped of their role in overseeing Northern Ireland. Since then, Frost has signalled his intention to join with others on the right of the Tory party, becoming a member of the so-called Covid Recovery Group, which is sceptical of restrictions and focused on getting the economy moving. The Tory peer told the Mail on Sunday: “We need to get the country going economically again and that means free markets, free debate and low taxes. “People need to look at this country and think: yes, something is changing here. You’ve got to set the direction of travel. If we’re going to get out of this little trough and win the election in a couple of years’ time, then we’ve got to develop that.” His demand for tax cuts comes amid growing unease among Thatcherite Tories about the government’s plans for a rise in national insurance contributions this April, which Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, pressed Johnson to scrap at cabinet this week. Frost also criticised the advisers around Johnson and joined the many Tory backbenchers calling for a shake-up of the No 10 team, while insisting he is still the right leader. “I think he probably needs better support around him in the team to deliver on that. The PM has a right, when he wants something to happen, for the levers that he pulls to actually produce something,” he said. “And he has the right to the best possible advice around him. So I think there needs to be machinery changes and there probably need to be some different voices around him to make sure that he gets the best possible advice.” Frost’s successor as chief negotiator with the EU is Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, who warned in an interview with the Sunday Telegraph that she was just as prepared as him to trigger article 16 of the post-Brexit agreement on Northern Ireland if necessary. Truss said she would suggest “constructive proposals” to her EU counterpart, Maroš Šefčovič, this week during their first face-to-face talks. However, she said she was “willing” to trigger article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol – a move that would suspend parts of the treaty designed to prevent a hard border with the Republic – if a deal could not be struck. In response, the EU ambassador to the UK, João Vale de Almeida, said it was “not very helpful that we keep agitating the issue of article 16” and insisted that the EU was “eager to reconnect with the British government”. Vale de Almeida told Sky News: “We’ve heard this before from the government, so we’re not surprised. We are not too impressed. We still believe it’s not very helpful that we keep agitating the issue of article 16. I think what we should focus on – at least that’s where we are focused on – is trying to find solutions for difficulties in the implementation of the protocol.”",News/UK news,"PM must commit to low taxes or risk losing next election, says David Frost",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/09/pm-boris-johnson-low-taxes-next-election-david-frost
