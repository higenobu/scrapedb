5/9/2022,"A group of SAS sergeants told SAS senior command a decade ago that Ben Roberts-Smith was unfit to be awarded the Victoria Cross, alleging he claimed battlefield kills made by other soldiers, and bullied and assaulted his comrades, the federal court has heard. A serving major in the SAS, anonymised before the court as Person 100 and giving evidence on behalf of Roberts-Smith, told the court that in 2013, when he was the SAS’s regimental sergeant major, he was approached by two separate groups of soldiers who raised concerns about Roberts-Smith not being “a fit and proper person” to hold Australia’s highest military honour. Roberts-Smith is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges are defamatory and portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies any wrongdoing. But Person 100 said no allegations of war crimes were raised, contradicting earlier testimony from soldiers who said they did report alleged war crimes, including murder, during the two meetings in 2013. At the 2013 meeting, four sergeants told Person 100 Roberts-Smith did not deserve his Victoria Cross. “I have concerns about Mr Roberts-Smith being a fit and proper person to be awarded the Victoria Cross,” one soldier, known as Person 7, told the meeting, according to Person 100’s testimony. “He has bullied me and others, and had claimed to have carried out actions that others believed they had carried out.” One of the sergeants told the meeting Roberts-Smith’s reports of his action in battle were falsely inflated, the court was told. “I shot an enemy combatant that Mr Roberts-Smith later claimed,” Person 43 told the meeting, according to Person 100’s testimony on Monday. The court heard that two soldiers reported being physically assaulted, harassed, and bullied by Roberts-Smith. Person 100 said that one told him he had been “bashed” by Roberts-Smith after a failed mission, during which he did not properly operate his weapon, and was then “belittled” and humiliated for six years afterwards. Person 100 told the court those allegations of bullying would be “followed up”. He said he raised the complaints with the SAS’s commanding officer. Roberts-Smith was awarded the VC in 2011 for his actions during the 2010 battle of Tizak. The court heard that one of the battlefield kills claimed by Roberts-Smith – an insurgent who was behind a boulder – occurred at the end of the Tizak battle. Another soldier also claimed to have killed that insurgent, the court heard. Several soldiers present at those meetings in 2013 have told the court they raised allegations of war crimes committed by Roberts-Smith with Person 100 during the meetings. Person 18 said the regimental sergeant major was told of allegations Roberts-Smith had kicked a handcuffed prisoner off a cliff during an SAS mission in Darwan, in southern Afghanistan, in 2012, before ordering the man shot. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The RSM [regimental sergeant major] said, words to the effect of, ‘it was out of his hands, it was way over his head, he honestly didn’t know what to do with it’,” Person 18 told the court during his evidence in March. Person 100, a witness called by Roberts-Smith to give evidence, told the court repeatedly on Monday that no soldiers raised any allegations of war crimes with him during either of the meetings. “I didn’t know about war crimes allegations in 2013.” Under cross-examination from Nicholas Owens, SC, acting for the newspapers, it was put to Person 100 that he was told of war crimes allegations but failed to act. “You were told of allegations that in 2012 a ‘PUC’ – person under control – was kicked off a cliff in Darwan?” “Incorrect sir,” Person 100 replied. “You were told of war crimes in 2009 [committed] at Whiskey 108,” Owens put to Person 100. “Completely incorrect sir.” Owens: “You didn’t report those allegations because they involved Mr Roberts-Smith.” Person 100: “Incorrect. Because no allegations were put to me.” Person 100 denied he had sought to protect Roberts-Smith, and the reputation of the SAS regiment, by not properly investigating the allegations against Roberts-Smith.

5/9/2022,"In February 2022, a Dutch-owned fishing trawler released a silvery stream of 100,000 dead fish, which carpeted several thousand square metres of ocean off the coast of France. The vessel’s owners blamed the discharge on a faulty net. Environmental groups alleged that the fish were intentionally dumped. Whatever the truth, that spectacle of squandered sea life was the tip of the iceberg: figures from WWF show that in 2019, at least 230,000 tonnes of fish were dumped in EU waters. Most of the waste – 92% – is related to bottom-trawling, a fishing method that scrapes the seafloor, indiscriminately scooping up everything in its path. But this figure is a small fraction of an even larger global issue. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that 35% of all fish, crustaceans and molluscs harvested from oceans, lakes and fish farms are wasted or lost before they ever reach a plate. Fish are highly perishable and fragile, which makes them more vulnerable to waste, a problem that is compounded by haemorrhaging fish at every step of the supply chain. Fish waste is especially shocking, says Pete Pearson, senior director for food waste at WWF, because they “are wild animals, so we are harvesting wildlife”. Fish populations are already threatened by overfishing, pollution, and the climate crisis. With current rates of fish consumption projected to double by 2050, waste is increasingly on the radar of regulators. “We have to do something about it,” says Omar Peñarubia, a fisheries officer at the FAO. That begins, experts say, with understanding exactly what is driving waste between harvest and plate. The task is made difficult by fisheries’ notoriously opaque supply chains, and incomplete datasets that are also inconsistent, although the evidence is clear that most fish waste starts at the point of extraction. Just under half of all fish consumed by people is wild-caught at sea. “There’s such abundance that we’ve grown to be OK with certain loss rates,” Pearson says, although noting that 34% of global marine stocks are now overfished. Bycatch (unintentionally caught, unwanted fish) is a growing problem, too: roughly 10% of wild-caught fish are discarded worldwide each year, representing 8.6m tonnes of animals. The main culprits are imprecise fishing gear and policies that allow fishers to discard non-target species. There’s an economic driver, too. “I think there is a strong connection between subsidies and waste in the water,” says Rashid Sumaila, professor of ocean and fisheries economics at the University of British Columbia. Although subsidies were historically devised to support small-scale fishers, today 80% of $35.4bn (£26.4bn) in annual fishing subsidies goes to a handful of industrial fleets, Sumaila’s research shows. These include gargantuan bottom trawlers that are uniquely equipped to travel out to the high seas and overfish, leading to discards on an industrial scale. The impact of illegal and unreported fishing is also important, says Sumaila, as it is likely contributing tonnes more bycatch to global fish waste. Fish waste is about more than just the physical loss of fish: for the 3 billion people whose diets depend on fish, it is a lost nutritional opportunity. “The narrative is that we have to produce more to feed the growing masses, but the greatest pathway to [increasing] supply is reducing loss and waste,” says Shakuntala Thilsted, global lead for nutrition and public health at World Fish and winner of the 2021 World Food Prize. Many see controlled aquaculture systems (or “fish farms”) – which generate more than half our fish supply – as a solution to the waste of wild fishing. But Dave Love, senior scientist at the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future, says that various factors, such as disease, are driving considerable losses on farms, too. “Mortality in fish ponds is actually a significant source of lost potential food,” Love says. Fish waste continues after harvest – though how it unfolds differs depending on location. The FAO estimates that 27% of all fish globally is lost or wasted after landing, but in low-income countries the fish is more likely to be unintentionally lost than wasted, says Peñarubia. One study showed that in Ghana, Burkina Faso and Togo, 65% of lost fish on land was attributable to poor handling, lack of storage and cooling facilities on fishing vessels and along the lengthy supply chain. Fish disappear after distribution, too, but here the culprits are retailers and consumers, almost exclusively in middle-and high-income countries. In North America, Oceania and Europe, fish waste at consumption far outstrips that of any other region in the world. Pearson thinks retailers in the US partly contribute to the problem by prioritising large, fresh fish to sell at a premium, which quickly spoil. “This is the real tragedy, because it’s moved all the way through the supply chain, and then we’re comfortable with a 10% to 30% loss rate in the grocery store,” he says. When retailers prioritise fresh fish, “the ripple effect is that consumers are more likely to waste that in their homes,” says Love, who published research showing that retailers were responsible for about 16% of wasted seafood in the US, while up to 63% comes down to consumers putting uneaten fish in the bin. Solutions do exist to reduce fish spoilage along the supply chain. Increasing access to cold-chain technologies in low-income countries, along with methods such as solar-powered drying tents, could extend the shelf life of fish. Fishers and processors also need training on better fish handling and storage to limit loss, Peñarubia says. At the consumer end, Pearson and Love argue that we should encourage more people to opt for frozen fish, which could reduce demand for fresh fish in grocery stores, and limit the amount that is lost in retail and people’s homes. Thilsted suggests diversifying our appetites beyond the ubiquitous fish fillet to smaller fish and bivalves, which can be consumed whole to reduce waste. “If our notion of ‘fish’ is a fillet on a pan, then we are already far down the path of loss and waste, because we have reduced the edible part to such a small portion of the whole.” Existing fish byproducts can be captured and turned into new ones. Fish heads, fins, and bones from the fishing industry are already a source of fertiliser and feed; now innovators are finding uses for everything from fish skin for burn treatments, and crustacean waste to make biodegradable packaging. “The idea of full utilisation is something that needs to be pervasive across all food supply chains” says Pearson, who cautions, however, that we shouldn’t overstate these solutions. Unless fish byproducts replace a share of fish demand, they are simply making use of waste – not reducing it at source. Ultimately, prevention is the best solution, starting at sea, where this problem begins, Pearson says. Fishers need to be equipped with more selective gear for fishing, and aided by policies that discourage discards. Sumaila underscores the need for “good subsidies” that can be channelled towards fisheries that help replenish wild stocks: “We need to spend taxpayers’ money in ways that reinforce positive feedback from people to nature, and nature to people,” he says. For generations we’ve believed “the ocean is huge, and we can just take whatever we want,” says Pearson. “Now we’re coming to see the limits of that. And when you have limits, it requires you to become more efficient.”",News/Environment,Millions of tonnes of dead animals: the growing scandal of fish waste,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/09/millions-of-tonnes-of-dead-animals-the-growing-scandal-of-fish-waste
5/9/2022,"In 2021, a hundred years after the creation of Northern Ireland, Boris Johnson tweeted: “Let me underline that, now & in the future, Northern Ireland’s place in the UK will be protected and strengthened.” Since the word “not” has to be inserted automatically into every positive statement Johnson makes, unionists ought to have taken this as fair warning: Year 101 of Northern Ireland’s existence would be its equivalent of George Orwell’s Room 101, where you are confronted by your own worst nightmares. After last week’s assembly elections, the unionist nightmare takes the amiable form of Michelle O’Neill, Sinn Féin’s vice-president and now putative first minister of the Northern Ireland executive. The source of dread is not so much O’Neill herself as the historic moment she embodies: Catholic nationalism outstripping Protestant unionism. Her party is dedicated above all to ending the union. It beat Johnson’s allies in the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) in first preference votes by eight percentage points. In a normal polity, the rise and fall of parties does not have existential implications. But Northern Ireland has never been normal. It was created to ensure one overwhelming imperative: to allow as many Protestants as possible to stay in the UK and exclude themselves from the emerging Irish state. Its border was drawn to create an area in which Protestants would have a permanent majority – which meant, of course, that its Catholic population would form a permanent minority. It’s been obvious for a long time that this bet on permanence, like every other such gamble in history, would ultimately be a losing one. The unionist political monolith crumbled in 1972, when Edward Heath, as prime minister, pulled the plug on its parliament in Stormont. From then on, it has been accepted that if Northern Ireland could be governed at all, it would only be through the sharing of power between nationalist and unionist parties. That arrangement was institutionalised by the Belfast agreement of 1998. In that sense, unionists have long since grown used to the reality that they would never again exercise power unilaterally. Yet they could still console themselves with the thought that, even if they had to accept equality with nationalists, they were first among equals. In some respects, this was a mere trick of language. The agreement designated the leader of the biggest party as “first minister” and of the biggest party from the other side as “deputy first minister”. This was bad drafting – the two offices have precisely equal status. But language and symbolism matter deeply in Northern Ireland and that unqualified “first” was a thick comfort blanket for unionism. It’s been ripped away now. Two big things happened in the election. One is that – because symbolism matters just as much on the nationalist side of the divide – the prospect of O’Neill becoming first minister drew some more Catholic voters away from the Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) and towards Sinn Féin. But the other is that Brexit continued its work of dividing and undermining unionism. This second factor was actually more consequential than the first. Sinn Féin’s share of the vote rose only modestly. But the significance of that increase was magnified by the DUP’s decline. In the assembly elections of May 2016, just a month before the Brexit referendum, the DUP took 29% of the vote. On Thursday, it got 21%. Its vote has dropped precipitously even though it had what ought to have been a trump card – the tribal fear that, unless Protestants voted for the DUP, Sinn Féin would win the election and proceed to push for a border poll on a United Ireland. (Ironically, while the DUP was playing up the alleged imminence of a border poll, Sinn Féin was careful to play it down and concentrated its campaign on bread-and-butter issues.) There is a very long history in Northern Ireland of holding your nose and voting for politicians from “our side”, not because you especially like them, but to keep the other crowd out. Why did this impulse not kick in this time? Because the Brexit revolution is devouring its own children. Apart from Ukip, the DUP was the only substantial party in the UK to be wholly and enthusiastically in favour of the hardest possible Brexit. It funnelled money into the leave campaign in England. Handed the balance of power at Westminster, it used it to help bring down Theresa May and install Johnson in Downing Street. And, remarkably for a party with a very high proportion of teetotallers, it got so drunk on the fumes of Brexit that it believed Johnson when he swore that there would be a border down the Irish Sea “over my dead body”. All of this made the DUP look foolish – admittedly not the most difficult achievement of the Brexit project. And it disturbed two very different groups of voters. One is hardline unionists who blame the DUP for having created, however inadvertently, the Northern Ireland protocol that keeps the region within the EU’s single market, even while Britain diverges ever further from it. Those people voted in significant numbers for the small Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV). The other alienated constituency is moderate Protestants who never wanted to be dragged out of the EU. They moved to the cross-community and pro-EU Alliance party. These developments raise two very big questions – the future of the protocol and a united Ireland. The first is clarified by the election. Put simply, if Johnson claims to be representing the people of Northern Ireland in using the protocol as an excuse to revive conflict with the EU, he is lying. The parties that oppose the protocol – the DUP, Ulster Unionists and TUV – got 40% of the vote between them. Those that support the protocol – Sinn Féin, the SDLP, Alliance and two small parties – got 55%. If the Tories follow through on Dominic Raab’s threat yesterday to take “whatever measures are necessary” to unilaterally alter the protocol, thus triggering a trade war with the EU, it will not be to honour the wishes of Northern Ireland’s voters. It will be a futile effort to save Johnson’s skin. As for a united Ireland, only a fool would think it’s coming soon – and only a bigger fool would think that it has not, in some form, come closer. It’s not coming soon because most Irish people have not really begun to grapple with what it might mean in practice. But the identity of Northern Ireland has been drastically altered by both the slow demographic change that has culminated in these election results and by the DUP’s embrace of Brexit extremism. The long and the short movements of history are coming together to create the sense of an ending. There is an urgent need to talk, in the most generous, open and imaginative way, about what Northern Ireland’s afterlife might look like and how everyone can find a place within it.

5/9/2022,"Barclays has avoided nearly £2bn in tax via a lucrative arrangement in Luxembourg that allowed it to pay less than 1% on profits in the tax haven for more than a decade. A Guardian analysis of Barclays’ tax bills shows it is still benefiting from a controversial decision in 2009, in which it booked profits from the $15.2bn sale of a fund management business in Luxembourg rather than in the UK where it is headquartered. By booking the profits overseas, Barclays was able to take advantage of a complex scheme whereby it could offset future profits against a drop in the value of company shares it acquired as part of the deal. The decision has resulted in Barclays earning billions of pounds nearly tax-free for more than 12 years, and has raised questions about whether it influenced the bank’s strategy in investing or growing the Luxembourg business at the expense of other locations, including the UK. The senior Labour MP Margaret Hodge said: “These revelations that Barclays is using a scheme in an infamous tax haven leaves the British-headquartered bank with important questions to answer. “Why is Barclays setting up shop in Luxembourg at all, other than to avoid tax? Does this artificial financial arrangement mean that profits are shifted away from the UK, thus harming our tax coffers? Or have business investments been channelled through this tax haven instead of in Britain, harming our economy in the process?” Barclays employs only 54 staff in Luxembourg, but it is currently the bank’s third most profitable jurisdiction behind the US and UK, with turnover of £1.1bn last year. Low staff costs mean Barclays can turn nearly all of that income from corporate and investment banking into profit. The bank has 46,000 staff in the UK and nearly 10,000 in the US. Cumulatively, Barclays’ Luxembourg operations have made £6.6bn in profits since 2013, according to annual tax documents released by the bank. Thanks to the generous tax arrangement, it has paid only £46m on those earnings, or about 1%. Barclays could have been taxed between 25 and 30% had it not taken advantage of rules allowing it to offset losses linked to $9bn-worth of shares acquired through the sale of its Barclays Global Investors (BGI) business to the US fund manager BlackRock in 2009. It means the bank could have saved £1.9bn in tax over the period, though the collective savings are likely to be much higher because it only started releasing country-by-country tax information in 2013 in response to EU rules. Reuters first revealed the tax arrangement in 2016, but the extent of the benefits were not known. Barclays has not referenced the BGI deal by name in its annual tax reports, but has said for years that its low tax bills are because of previous losses. “We paid no corporation tax in Luxembourg in 2021 as our taxable profits were offset by substantial tax losses brought forward from prior years, and also due to dividend income not being taxable under Luxembourg law”, its 2021 report stated. “We have unused tax losses which are automatically carried forward, and available to offset against future taxable profits.” Barclays said in a statement: “The structure of the BGI sale was not aimed at securing a tax reduction but intended to secure a simpler and more certain tax treatment and avoid volatility in the bank’s regulatory capital.” It said it had not booked any profits from other jurisdictions in Luxembourg, and stressed that it paid more than £14bn in taxes in the UK over the past decade. Barclays’ Luxembourg operations, which were established in 2007, have courted controversy before. The bank’s former chief executive Antony Jenkins pledged to shut down a unit in the Grand Duchy that helped wealthy customers avoid tax in 2013. At the time, the bank was reporting profits of around £1.4bn, about £100m for each of the 14 people employed there. The winding down of the unit resulted in a drop in local profits in subsequent years, falling as low as £318m in 2018. Barclays, however, announced fresh investment in 2019, helping profits rebound to more than £1.1bn by 2020. It involved expanding services for its multinational clients, despite its staff base only increasing to just over 50 employees. Today the bank offers a range of services out of Luxembourg, which it said was focused on serving local clients and offering cash management, debt, foreign exchange and trade finance.",News/Business,Revealed: Barclays avoids almost £2bn in tax via Luxembourg scheme,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/09/revealed-barclays-avoids-almost-2bn-in-tax-via-luxembourg-scheme

It happens in several stages, the first being the penumbral phase. This begins at 0232 BST on 16 May. The penumbral eclipse means that although most of the sun’s light is blocked, some rays can still reach the moon. It creates a subtle darkening effect that can easily go unnoticed. More dramatic is the second stage, the umbral eclipse. This is when we can see the darkest part of the Earth’s shadow passing across the lunar surface. It begins at 0327 BST and culminates in the moon becoming fully eclipsed at 0429 BST. In the full eclipse phase, the moon appears to turn coppery red. This is because the Earth’s atmosphere bends some of the sun’s light towards it. From the UK, the moon will set soon after this but the eclipse will continue until 0750 BST.

5/9/2022,"Asweet smell wafts through the air, as two men weave through the small room tightly packed with cannabis plants, growing high above their shoulders in a flush of intoxicating flora. This isn’t yet another illegal weed factory but one of the first licensed medicinal marijuana labs in Britain. Wielding a quantum sensor, microscope and leaf barometer to check in on the 180 plants growing up to 1.5 metres tall out of waist-height hydroponic planters, the two men are agronomists – experts in the science of crop production – at the West Midlands plant owned by Celadon Pharmaceuticals. They want to ensure optimal light, oxygen, water and nutrient levels, and harvest the flowers after about nine weeks, from which cannabinoids are extracted and put into vials. The cannabis grown for medicinal purposes is under tightly controlled conditions that ensure consistency and high quality across batches at a secret location by a startup created in 2018, the year Sajid Javid, the then UK home secretary, authorised its use. Celadon is one of the few firms that grow medical cannabis in the UK but, unlike others, uses an indoor lab rather than greenhouses. This means it can produce five to six harvests each year and a much higher yield, it says, although an indoor lab is more expensive to run. The company is following in the footsteps of GW Pharmaceuticals, a trailblazer that developed the first cannabis-based medicine to be licensed in the UK in 2010, Sativex for multiple sclerosis, which costs about £2,000 a year. However, NHS prescribing of the mouth spray remains very limited and varies across the country. Javid’s decision to legalise medical cannabis in 2018 came after a long-running campaign waged by the parents of children diagnosed with severe epilepsy, who reported that cannabis oil helped with their condition. However, medical cannabis can only be prescribed by specialist doctors, patients often pay for it themselves, and it cannot be imported until a prescription has been issued, on a named-patient basis. James Short, the 54-year-old founder and chief executive of Celadon, was sceptical at first. “In early 2018, my son approached me and asked me did I want to invest in the medical cannabis sector? I said it’s not for me,” he says. “When the government legalised it, he came back to me and I said: ‘Let’s look at it.’ I spoke to many patients who have used medicinal cannabis, especially for chronic pain, and it was those patients that persuaded me that it wasn’t snake oil – it really worked and had changed their lives.” Robin Davison, a biotech analyst at Equity Development, says: “A lot of people do find they are getting pain relief for long-term pain like back pain [from medical cannabis], and they want to avoid using opioids.” Other promising areas include anxiety, particularly in Alzheimer’s patients, which the rival pharmaceutical firm MGC is studying. Celadon is believed to be one of the first pharmaceutical companies in the UK to receive a home office licence to grow high tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) medicinal cannabis, and will initially focus on chronic pain treatments. It is working with partners to investigate the potential of cannabinoids in other areas, including autism and diabetes. The cannabis plant has hundreds of different natural compounds, or cannabinoids. The two best known are THC, which on the wrong levels can cause a “high” but relieves pain, and CBD, which is anti-inflammatory and moderates the psychoactive nature of THC. The company grew some cannabis test batches to gain approval from the UK medical regulator, the the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, and is working on ramping up production. At full capacity, it could grow 10 to 15 tonnes a year and supply up to 50,000 patients, generating £90m in annual revenues. Short has ambitions to open more sites. Big pharma has so far stayed away from a rapidly growing market that could be lucrative to the smaller players. The industry group Prohibition Partners estimates that about €354m worth of unlicensed medical cannabis will be sold in Europe this year, and projects this will grow to €2.3bn (£2bn) by 2026. Other analysts reckon these forecasts are too high but say growth will still be impressive. Celadon has taken a majority stake in the private London pain clinic LVL Health, which is testing medical cannabis in 100 patients with non-cancer chronic pain in a feasibility study, before a wider trial of up to 5,000 people, the only such UK trial that has conditional regulatory approval. They are given an inhaler that uses ground cannabis flower in a cartridgewhich is a smart device that is connected to an app to control dosage. Short, from Preston, is a former property developer who later switched to generating energy from waste, and then started investing in data companies. He had bought a £30m one-storey datacentre that now serves as the site of Celadon’s 100,000 sq ft medical cannabis lab, guarded by high security. The Department of Health estimates that 8 million people in the UK suffer from a form of chronic pain, of whom 3 million may be eligible for cannabinoid medicines where other treatments have failed. An estimated 1.4 million people are buying cannabis products on the black market to self-medicate. While the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes dates back thousands of years, the UK has lagged behind other countries such as Canada and Germany, and there have been calls on the government to allow GPs to prescribe medical cannabis. Short’s greatest frustration is the lack of reimbursement, and he says this is shortsighted. “I speak to patients on a regular basis who can’t work and are in terrible pain each day, that don’t want to be on opioids. Some are having to pay hundreds of pounds each month for medicinal cannabis. It really does work.”",News/Society,Inside one of the first licensed medical cannabis labs in Britain,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/09/inside-one-of-the-first-licensed-medical-cannabis-labs-in-britain
5/9/2022,"Half of older women fear they will have to keep working beyond the state pension age in order to make ends meet, according to research. As many as 53% of women aged 45 and over surveyed by the older worker advice website Workingwise.co.uk said they were concerned that their pension would not be enough for them to be financially independent in later life. The study, carried out to investigate women’s economic situation as they approach retirement, exposes the lasting impact that career breaks – such as time off to bring up young children or to care for relatives – or working part-time can have on women’s pension payouts. The vast majority (83%)of more than 1,300 older women surveyed had worked part-time for at least one year during their career, and 27%had worked part-time for more than a decade. Almost three-quarters thought that part-time work, or a career break, were responsible for the reduction in their pension payments. As many as 64% said they had previously stopped their pension payments, either when out of the workplace or working reduced hours. Jenny, 62, who works in a managerial role for a local authority on the south coast of England, had expected to be retiring at about her current age. However, a stint working part-time when her children were young means she can’t afford to retire yet, or reduce her hours. “It does worry me. I don’t need loads of stuff [in retirement] but I need to run my house, which will be about £600 a month with bills,” she said. “We live in expensive area.” Jenny will not reach state pension age for almost five years, and expects her pension to be the main source of income for her household in years to come, as her partner is self-employed. She would like to work fewer hours so she can spend more time with her grandchildren, who she helps to look after. “I do like working, I just don’t want to be tired and stressed, as I need my energy for other stuff,” Jenny said. As many as six in 10 women surveyed by Workingwise.co.uk said they believed their career progression had been affected by caring responsibilities, while more than a quarter said the menopause had held them back in the workplace. The gender pension gap, or the difference in pension income between female and male pensioners has been estimated at about 38%, according to Gillian Nissim, the founder of Workingwise.co.uk. Nissim is calling for changes in the workplace to tackle the gender pension gap, given that women tend to be lower paid and on average have smaller pension pots than men, resulting in lower incomes in retirement. Official figures from the Office for National Statistics showed women earned about 15% less than men in 2021. “Women are more likely to have ongoing caring responsibilities that mean they will reduce their hours, work part-time or require flexible working,” Nissim said. “These career decisions are then coming back to haunt women’s pensions in later life.” Cecilia Floren, who is 45, works three jobs to support herself and her daughters, while her 78-year-old mother, who is retired and lives abroad, also relies on her for some financial support. “The last thing I want is to find myself in the situation that my mother is in,” Floren said, adding that she worked part-time when she first had her children, and also spent some time living abroad, when she didn’t pay into a pension. Worried about the impact of the cost of living crisis, she expects to work for another 25 to 30 years, although she would have liked to retire earlier if she had more information about pensions. “In the current climate, things are going to get worse and people will stop paying into non-essential things like pensions to keep their household running,” she said.",Lifestyle/Money,Half of older women fear having to work beyond UK state pension age – study,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/09/half-of-older-women-fear-having-to-work-beyond-uk-state-pension-age-study
5/9/2022,"The UK government’s roads agency is facing hundreds of objections a week to its decision to bury a Victorian bridge arch under concrete in a move widely condemned as “cultural vandalism”. National Highways (NH) was forced to apply for retrospective planning permission for a decision last May to pour 1,000 tonnes of concrete and aggregate under the arch of the bridge in Great Musgrave, Cumbria. Since the agency submitted the application to Eden district council at the start of last month, the council’s planning department has received 795 objections and only nine expressions of support. A council spokesperson said: “It’s unusually large, but is not surprising given the strength of local feeling about the issue.” A national outcry last year about the Great Musgrave infill project prompted government intervention to pause NH’s plans to infill dozens of other Victorian bridges across England. If the council rejects the application, NH will be obliged to restore the bridge to its former condition at an estimated cost of £431,000, in addition to the £124,000 it spent on the infilling work. Campaigners argue that restoring the bridge will help allay fears about the resumption of NH’s previous plans to infill or demolish up to 78 other historical bridges. Graeme Bickerdike, a member of the HRE Group, an alliance of engineers and sustainable transport advocates campaigning to reuse the historical railway network, said: “While it remains infilled Great Musgrave bridge will stand as a monument to National Highways failure and dishonesty.” He says the Musgrave bridge requires only £20,000-worth of pointing repairs to make it safe enough to carry 40-tonne loads. In its planning objection to the project, the HRE said it was an “opportunistic act of liability reduction, surrounded by deceit, hysteria and questionable competence”. It accused NH of inventing safety fears about the bridge to justify the work. “There was no evidence of an impending emergency; the powers were being abused,” the objection said. A NH spokesperson denied it had behaved dishonestly. A spokesperson said: “We consulted with the planning authority which told us that it considered the works to be permitted development. Infilling was the most cost-effective solution for this weak bridge.” The HRE Group has established that 15 other historical bridges due to be infilled by NH using emergency powers, including one near Saltash designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, have since been removed from NH’s works programme. “How can ‘emergencies’ at 15 bridges have simply disappeared into the ether?” Bickerdike asked. Campaigners also say the infilled arch at Great Musgrave thwarts aspirations to link two vintage railways between Warcop and Kirkby Stephen in the Eden valley. Phil Dew, an Eden councillor and chair of the Upper Eden Railway Heritage Partnership, said: “This was a case of cultural vandalism and desecration of a highly valued structure. Any issues would have been far better resolved by maintaining the bridge in a proper way. The two railways have been ridden roughshod over.” Bickerdike added: “Planning is decided on the quality of the objections, not the volume, but what 795 objections does show is that the public is not happy about this and that’s an important message.” National Highways’ head of Historical Railways Estate programme, Hélène Rossiter, insisted that infilling the Great Musgrave bridge was crucial for public safety and that “all relevant processes and procedures were followed” before the bridge was infilled. She pointed out that those hoping for an Eden valley railway under the bridge have yet to find funding or provide a date for the project. But she added: “We’ve committed to reversing it [the bridge infill] if a viable future use for the track bed beneath the bridge is found, that has all necessary approvals and is ready to be delivered.”",News/UK news,Cumbrian council may reverse concrete infilling of Victorian bridge,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/09/cumbrian-council-may-reverse-concrete-infilling-of-victorian-bridge
5/9/2022,"In 1971, facing tax problems and an uncertain future, the Rolling Stones decamped to Villa Nellcôte on the Côte d’Azur, where they partied with various celebrities, musicians, girlfriends, wives, kids, animals, drug-dealers and hangers-on for several hedonistic months. Recording in the damp, labyrinthine basement with a mobile studio parked outside and musicians seemingly turning up at random, they somehow produced Exile on Main St, a rough-hewn, sprawling, eclectic, 18-song double album that is widely regarded as their creative peak. Here, as it turns 50, stars salute its enduring greatness. We were American hardcore punk kids, but when we discovered Exile we called it the Bible. In our infancy, we wanted to capture that magic and mystery. It’s English guys looking at American blues, country rock, soul and gospel through their own aesthetic of drugs, satin shirts and sparkly shoes. The Stones had the guts to remove themselves from society and live outside the law, but among the grit and dirt, the overdoses and arrests, there’s a romanticism that goes back to Baudelaire and Rimbaud. We recently covered Rocks Off. I love its romantic decadence: “I was making love this time with a dancer friend of mine. / I couldn’t seem to stay in step, but she comes every time that she pirouettes on me.” It’s a holy relic, so playing it felt like walking with John the Baptist. Exile feels slanted and open-ended with human error, which makes it gorgeous. There’s mystery and mythology – tax exiles, drugs coming into the house, living free as fuck. All sorts of people coming and going, but somehow holding it together enough to record these songs, outside of the recording studio. They broke the mould with that album. Shake Your Hips goes right into my body and my butt starts moving. Exile is the outlaw of their catalogue. It’s my favourite Stones album, such a bizarre and funky record with so much diversity, from Tumbling Dice to the almost gospel of I Just Want to See His Face. There’s a carefree magic unburdened by their status as world’s biggest rock band. It’s not particularly commercial, but it’s elegant and beautiful. Mick Jagger’s lyrics are fantastic. It’s not a good times record. It’s questioning and paranoid. It sounds like they’ve been through a kaleidoscope. In that period people obviously took a lot of drugs, and some would just show up and forget they played on it. I’m still trying to unravel it. I heard Shine a Light on a mixtape on a road trip and went: “What is this? Is there more?” As someone raised in the African American south, the gospel and blues influences are so rich for me. I love the slow build of Shine a Light and the bass [played by Mick Taylor, not Bill Wyman]. The song’s about Brian Jones but also about drug addiction. To me, 50 years later, it speaks to today’s opioid crisis in America and shines a light for them. Mick, Keith [Richards] and I were in Little Boy Blue and the Blue Boys, then we met Brian Jones at the Ealing jazz club. I remember us playing Muddy Waters’ Rolling Stone Blues, then standing in front of the fireplace in the Bricklayer’s Arms in Soho when someone said: “Why don’t we call ourselves the Rollin’ Stones?” – without the “g” at that point. After I joined the Pretty Things, I followed the Stones’ progress. By Exile they’d been through the British blues explosion, the psychedelic period, huge success and trauma, and Exile partly returns to the blues but vastly changed by their experiences. I love their cover of Robert Johnson’s Stop Breaking Down. It’s almost shambolic, but falls into place. The whole album is an amazing work. They were the biggest band in the world but went off to France and pretty much almost killed themselves making this album that is insane yet somehow makes sense. They were in tax trouble. Keith and then Mick Taylor got into heroin. Keith didn’t show up some days, or Bill or Charlie [Watts, drummer] wouldn’t be on some tracks. I don’t think they’d have chosen to make a record like that but maybe that jeopardy and desperation is part of why it sounds like it does, although Mick subsequently took the tracks to Sunset Sound in Los Angeles to save it. I don’t know what was added there, but Exile is shrouded in mystery and enigma. It’s like they’ve heard blues, gospel and soul down a telephone, misheard it, but played it their way and made it better. I love Sweet Virginia. Instead of copying the country songs about losing your wife or dog, Mick is singing: “I hid the speed inside my shoe.” It’s quintessential Rolling Stones. Exile is the child in the attic of Stones albums. I know Mick thinks it’s a bit sloppy and could have sounded better but I think: “Dude, the sound is the genius!” That’s what makes it so real. I love side two, the honky-tonk/country side. It’s happy but there’s a lot of melancholy to it. Torn and Frayed is such a beautiful song, seemingly about Keith Richards. “Doctor prescribes drug store supplies. / Who’s gonna help him to kick it?” He is a torn and frayed dude. Exile is a completely unpolished record: absolutely real, ragged and beautiful. It’s heavily influenced by Delaney and Bonnie and Joe Cocker’s Mad Dogs and Englishmen, and the Exile horn section of Bobby Keys and Jim Price were in both of those bands. The record itself is like a swamp, or going down into the basement of Villa Nellcôte. Shine a Light, about Brian Jones, has that killer first line: “Saw you stretched out in room ten-oh-nine.” Mick Taylor plays this fantastic virtuoso guitar solo which I always thought was for Brian, his deceased predecessor. Let It Loose has another killer first verse: “Who’s that woman on your arm? All dressed up to do you harm / And I’m hip to what she’s gonna do / Give her just about a month or two.” And the cyclical Keith Richards guitar riff. Wicked. When I was 13, I bought the album with money my mother gave me to go food shopping. It was harder to get into than other Stones albums but harder to get sick of because there were so many songs. I aspired to play guitar like Keith or Mick Taylor, and I definitely copied Mick when I started singing. I love Rocks Off, Tumbling Dice, All Down the Line, Let It Loose. My favourite track is probably Happy, with Keith singing and Mick harmonising. Rather than listen to American blues, I listened to this mysterious version from England. They were emerging from the shadow of the Beatles to be the best band in the world. Most Jamaicans aren’t really into rock music but the Rolling Stones were among my favourite groups growing up. Years later, a record producer, Richard Feldman, introduced us to Sweet Black Angel for us to cover. We loved it. Then I realised it was about Angela Davis, a revolutionary lady who was imprisoned [for 16 months] before charges were eventually dropped. This was the time of the Black Panthers and arrests for speaking freely. It was brave of them to write a song about her, but they were rebels in their own way. When we covered it we changed a line to suit the times we were in, and added women singers to make it different. In Pussy Galore, we covered Exile in its entirety because Sonic Youth had joked in interviews about doing the Beatles’ White Album. I hadn’t actually heard the Stones’ original then. Neil Hagerty would play us the songs on his guitar – then as soon as we could play it, it was a take. The original has the same shagginess. Turd on the Run is raw rockabilly-blues, a pretty nasty song about a love affair gone wrong, and seems almost omnisexual or pansexual. In 1972 people just didn’t write songs like that. It’s punk rock. When we started the band, we were trying to achieve the guitar tone on tracks like Tumbling Dice and Happy. I love the way the Stones worked in that period, recording at night – because Keith wouldn’t surface until later – and just jamming things out. Keith and Gram Parsons were getting up to all sorts of madness. Even the producer, Jimmy Miller, started using heroin. There’s all these amazing people on it, like Billy Preston, Nicky Hopkins, Bobby Keys, Dr John. Mick probably pulled it all together. The cover reflects the album, all these bits cobbled together that somehow make a brilliant whole. I came across Exile because Pussy Galore covered the entire album on cassette, and there was a certain mythology around that. Once I listened to the original, I heard tunes and phrases others had borrowed. Rocks Off became a chorus for Primal Scream, shares a line of lyric with the Lemonheads, and Exile was a huge influence on Royal Trux. The recording quality is raw and rehearsal-room, not pristine or glossy, and all the more appealing for it. Rocks Off was one of the first “rock” records I played at DJ sets and house parties and is still in my record box. Exile coincided with their best stage look – Mick in the blue Ossie Clark catsuit with white Derby shoes. He looks awesome. There’s this undercurrent of strained relationships, tax avoidance and a smattering of heroin abuse. Mick is a chameleon in his singing. In Sweet Virginia he becomes a southern gentleman. Last year, we took a few days off and went to see Villa Nellcôte. Now I want to keep going back. I love that album so much it’s determined my holidays!

5/9/2022,"Andrea Wright, 39, from Bristol, was diagnosed in 2013 with psoriatic arthritis and fibromyalgia, a long-term condition that causes pain all over the body. She was in such severe constant pain, and unable to sleep for more than two continuous hours a night, that she was retired on ill health from her job at National Grid “at the grand old age of 33”. She says: “I had to stop work because the pain was too much. It’s been very depressing; I really enjoyed my job. I tried so many different therapies and managed to get my arthritis under control but for fibromyalgia, there isn’t anything, no magical pill.” She was taking up to 40 tablets a day, including 14 prescriptions such as opiate painkillers, as well as sleeping pills and laxatives to relieve the constipation caused by the painkillers. Wright would never consider smoking cannabis recreationally but started inhaling medicinal cannabis as part of a study run by the private London pain clinic LVL Health in January. “To begin with I was completely knocked out but you do get used to it. Straight away my sleep was a million times better. I probably hadn’t had a proper night’s sleep since 2012. I stopped taking any sleeping pills. My pain levels have completely dropped as well.” Her next step is to start weaning herself off the opiate painkillers. She will always have to take some medication but is now working as an operations manager for Flowaime, a Cadent (previously National Grid) contractor. “I’m able to work longer hours and go into the office. I wouldn’t be doing what I’m doing now if it wasn’t for medical cannabis. It’s been life-changing.”",News/Society,‘My pain levels have completely dropped’: how medical marijuana changed my life,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/09/my-pain-levels-have-completely-dropped-how-medical-marijuana-changed-my-life
5/9/2022,"Away across the valley, the cliffs of Cronkley Scar rise up, a sombre grey wall of dolerite columns. We cross the Tees by Cronkley Bridge, the river running low in this dry spring. Then it’s up through a forest of twisted junipers – the largest area of this native conifer in England – and across the moor to join the Green Trod. This ancient drover’s road is a wide green band that climbs up to Cronkley Fell in the Moor House-Upper Teesdale national nature reserve. To botanists these names, along with Widdybank Fell and Cow Green to the west, hold a kind of magic. As the path gains height it fragments into a mass of boulders. Grouse retreat into the heather telling us to “go back, go back”. On the flat exposed hilltop is the first of several exclosures fenced against grazing. We edge round it, using binoculars to spot treasures growing among straw-coloured grasses. There are tiny bird’s-eye primroses, Primula farinosa, their heart-shaped petals a startling sugar pink. Emerald leaves of twayblade grow alongside those of mountain everlasting, Antennaria dioica, with their furry white undersides. And there – the plants I’d most hoped to see, startling in their blue intensity, the most celebrated of the “ice flowers”, a cluster of spring gentians, Gentiana verna. Their buds are beautiful too, dark blue like tightly furled umbrellas. These rarities, growing on the sugar limestone of the hilltop, are part of the Teesdale assemblage, plants considered to have survived continuously since the last ice age. Surveying them has been the life work of the eminent botanist Dr Margaret Bradshaw. Shocked by the declines she has recorded, she formed the Teesdale Special Flora Research and Conservation Trust. Last year, at the age of 95, Margaret trekked 88km on her pony, Sigma, to raise funds for her charity; she learned to ride two years before and is still riding. This year the spring gentians are flowering earlier. Botanists predicted this would happen in a changing climate. The trust’s mission to survey and protect these arctic-alpine plants is urgent. I feel grateful for my day in the hills and the singing blue of the gentians.

5/9/2022,"The head of a major Australian aged care provider has warned workforce shortages and underfunding are exhausting staff and driving the sector into an “untenable standstill”. The BaptistCare NSW and ACT chief executive, Charles Moore, has issued a plea to whichever party forms government to act immediately to improve aged care funding, warning the current pressures are unsustainable and are hitting vulnerable residents as well as staff. “Workforce shortages are exhausting our staff and many hard-working people in the sector are barely able to keep up with the cost of living, with inflation rising to a point that’s more than twice the rate of wages growth,” he told the Guardian. “Our sector is underfunded and falling into an untenable standstill. It’s impacting both our workers and the most vulnerable in our society, and voters are seeing this too.” BaptistCare on Monday released polling it commissioned on voters’ attitudes to aged care funding and staff pay, conducted by YouGov. It found Australians ranked aged care workers behind only hospital workers in terms of who should be paid the highest. The overwhelming majority of voters said there were important actions the incoming government should take with respect to the aged care sector, with increasing funding the most important, according to the poll. Almost half of those polled said they had become less confident in the aged care sector in the past 12 months, and 83% said policies on aged care would be important in shaping their vote. There was also some confusion among voters about who is responsible for funding aged care. Only one in three believed the aged care system was majority funded by government, and 52% said they were unsure of the level of government funding given to the sector. “It’s critical for our new government to commit to resolving the systemic issues in aged care, however the scale of the investment needed may come as a shock to many in the community,” Moore said. “With aged care almost wholly government funded, this data shows a significant gap in the community’s understanding of the significant role that government plays in a sector that’s currently on its knees.” Moore said BaptistCare was eager to work with the new government to resolve the sector’s issues, but said it was up to government to “future-proof the sector with increased funding that ensures our nation’s aged care workers are receiving fair financial recognition for the critical care they provide”. The Fair Work Commission last week began hearings into whether Australia’s aged care workforce should receive a 25% pay rise, to bring their pay into parity with disability and hospital workers. Meanwhile, aged care workers across the country have voted to take industrial action over acute staff shortages and continuing low rates of pay. The United Workers Union says the mood mood for strike action prior to the election is “very strong”.",News/Australia news,"Underfunding and staff shortages are driving aged care sector to ‘untenable standstill’, major provider warns",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/09/underfunding-and-staff-shortages-are-driving-aged-care-sector-to-untenable-standstill-major-provider-warns
5/9/2022,"A rugby club has been left in shock after Samoan back row forward Kelly Meafua died after jumping from a bridge into the river Tarn hours after playing in a French second division match. Meafua’s club Montauban confirmed the 32-year-old had not survived the incident in the early hours of Saturday morning despite the efforts of a teammate. The teammate, named as prop Christopher Vaotoa in French media reports, jumped into the water but was unable to save Meafua. Vaotoa was taken to hospital with hypothermia and was discharged in good health on Saturday. The pair had reportedly been out celebrating Montauban’s 48-40 win over Narbonne just hours earlier in the team’s final home Pro D2 game of the season at Stade Sapiac. Montauban said the club was in shock following Meafua’s death. “The entire club is shocked and everyone is thinking of his wife, his children, his teammates and more generally everyone who loves the club,” a club statement read. “Kelly was a player who was well liked by everybody. His joy for life was infectious and radiant. Today we have lost a player, a friend and a brother.” Born in Samoa, Meafua moved to New Zealand when he was a teenager but did not start playing rugby until he was 20.

5/9/2022,"The second leaders’ debate of the election campaign, hosted by Channel Nine, attracted 641,000 viewers, however the network’s own employees have criticised the format as a “shambles”. The Great Debate on Nine averaged 641,000 metro viewers, a relatively high figure for a 90-minute program ending after 10pm on a Sunday night. Hosted by 60 Minutes reporter Sarah Abo, the debate won its time slot, beating Seven News’ Spotlight, Ten’s FBI and the new Australian drama Barons on the ABC. The strong ratings performance of the second election debate gave Nine an easy win on Sunday, with 33.4% to Seven’s 30.4%, Ten’s 15.8%, ABC 12.5% and SBS 7.9%. Watching that #leadersdebate was like having all the worst elements of this agonising campaign squeezed into an hour and a half window. Pure torture. Leaders faced questions from three journalists at the Nine network – 2GB radio host Deborah Knight, Nine News’ political editor Chris Uhlmann, and the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age’s chief political correspondent David Crowe. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, were also allowed to ask each other two questions. Viewers writing on Twitter criticised how the debate was run, with both leaders consistently talking over each other and the presenters asking questions. A website Nine ran to gather audience opinion on who won the debate encountered technical issues. Still not working #leadersdebate pic.twitter.com/WI03kQjEAB On Monday morning, Ben Fordham, a talkback host at Nine’s 2GB radio station, was critical of the debate format, saying it was “all over the shop”. “People have got better things to do than waste their Sunday night listening to two people talking over each other. It’s like watching two blokes at the pub arguing over the colour of the carpet,” he said. “It was a shambles. It was messy, disjointed, awkward,” Fordham said. The Sydney Morning Herald and the Age’s national affairs editor James Massola – also an employee of Nine – wrote “it was supposed to be a civilised election debate, but it ended up being a straight-up political brawl with no clear winner”. So, Nine’s debate QR code seems to have gone a bit rogue. 👇🏻 pic.twitter.com/x5nUrHZyrO “The two leaders repeatedly needled and jabbed at each other, talking over the top of their counterpart in a bid to unsettle them,” he said. The Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young said the debate format was “woeful and a disservice to voters”, and backed calls for an independent debates commission to be established. “Those of us who suffered through it watched two grown men – so-called leaders – shouting at each other, interrupting, smirking and aggressively talking over the top of others including the female moderator. Wow this is a rabble “Australians shouldn’t be subjected to this unseemly squabble again. An election debate should be a contest of ideas and vision for our country, not chest-thumping,” Hanson-Young said.

5/9/2022,"Taiwanese people don’t mind queueing. They’ll do it for a well-reviewed restaurant, promotional giveaways, or to take an Instagram photo at a popular tourist site. But at 3pm outside a Gongguan pharmacy in Taipei, there’s grumbling in the line. It’s an inconvenient time to leave work, but for now it’s the only way to get your hands on a rapid Covid-19 test. Twenty minutes after the sales window opens, a woman walks out to the waiting customers: they’ve sold out. People are frustrated, having waited for up to two hours, and some leave to try again tomorrow. Two elderly people lean over a phone, looking at a map for other pharmacies nearby. The pharmacist tells the Guardian that the store is only given 78 tests each day, and always sell out in less than half an hour. She laughs when asked if they can request more. The disappointed customers rush to another pharmacy, where an employee with a megaphone says there are only tests left for the next four people. When one of those four says they aren’t there to buy a test, the woman in fifth place jumps and shrieks with joy. An hour earlier, the central epidemic command centre (CECC) had reported more than 30,000 cases for the previous 24 hours – the first time Taiwan has seen such numbers in this pandemic. Once a poster child for the success of zero-Covid, Taiwan is now dealing with an “Omicron tsunami”. In response – and in stark contrast to regional neighbours – health authorities have decided zero-Covid is no match for the new variant and have flipped the switch to “living with the virus”. “It is the right decision, and it’s also the decision we had to make,” says Dr Chen Chien-jen, Taiwan’s former vice-president and professor of epidemiology. Taiwan closed itself off in early 2020, and employed a regime of stringent contact tracing, social restrictions and personal hygiene measures which it kept even as vaccines and antivirals were developed. It defeated an outbreak of the Alpha strain and another of Delta in 2021. But after the highly virulent Omicron began affecting countries in November and December, Chen says he and other scholars advised the government to start shifting towards living with the virus. “The CECC decided we should adopt the policy some time later when booster shots reached around 40-45% [several months away], but Omicron never waits for anyone,” he tells the Guardian. Instead, it began spreading through the community in March. Hong Kong, Taiwan and China were until now the last three major economies still clinging to zero-Covid. In Hong Kong the policy failed and the virus overwhelmed the city with disastrous results. In China, a steadfast commitment to it has produced arduous and economically damaging lockdowns, especially in Shanghai, with no end in sight. Taiwan appears to have seen both options, and decided on a third. It’s called the “new Taiwanese model”: an acknowledgment that they can’t stop the spread of Omicron, but that they can try – to use an early pandemic-era phrase – to flatten the curve. Cases are still rising and experts predict a peak is three weeks away, with as many as 3.5 million of Taiwan’s 24.5 million people expected to eventually be infected, and up to 16,000 dead. As daily tallies ticked past 30,000 this week, the CECC continued to ease restrictions, drop mandatory QR code check-ins, and reduce quarantine times. It urged people to maintain mask-wearing, work from home if they could, reduce gatherings, get vaccinated and take a rapid test if they felt symptoms. It’s also trusting people to self-report, and isolate or quarantine at home. So is it working? In many ways, yes. Chen notes the fatality rate of the outbreak is still extremely low, below 0.2%. This year 66 people have died with Covid-19, bringing Taiwan’s total to 919 out of more than 345,000 cases. More than 99.75% of Omicron cases are mild or asymptomatic, and residents and businesses are still going about their days without lockdowns or panic. Visitor groups are being gradually allowed to return. Hospitals are not at capacity, thanks to Taiwan pre-emptively ending a policy of mandatory hospitalisation for all cases. The same policy in Hong Kong had filled its hospitals before the wave began, but in Taiwan just 44% of hospital ICU beds (more than 62% in Taipei) were full as of Friday. Prof Yen Muh-yong, the director of the infectious disease department at Cheng Hsin hospital, says Taiwan’s diversion of cases away from hospitals has been “very successful in relieving pressure” so far. But he fears it still won’t be enough for this wave and urges more integration of local and district services, to create surge capacity in the workforce and reduce hospital crowds. As cases rise there are also criticisms, including that the government is more reactive than proactive. Yen says transitioning to coexistence was the right decision, “but the brain is giving directions the hands and feet are not coping with”. “The government did not plan in advance for the procedures and the preparedness to live with the Omicron tsunami.” Rules and regulations change almost daily and incrementally. The death of a two-year-old boy last month highlighted communication failures exacerbated by Taiwan’s entrenched bureaucracy. The child’s parents had wanted to send their son to hospital but got conflicting instructions from multiple health services. By the time they got him to hospital it was too late. In factories, migrant workers have once again been discriminated against with unequal rule enforcement and eased restrictions, and poor vaccination rates among the very old and very young remain too low. Many elderly people have refused to get vaccinated against Covid-19, and the government only recently allowed vaccination for under-12s, despite lobbying from anxious parents. Across the capital city, hospitals are reporting crowds of patients who are not sick with Covid. A nurse and anaesthetist at a Taipei hospital tells the Guardian her colleagues are understaffed and overworked, and don’t feel well supported. “Everyone is nervous and they want to have PCR tests so they come to the emergency room, but there are also the patients who need to get more care than other people.” The nurse says there is not enough protective equipment or backup to replace staff who go on leave because they caught the virus, are a close contact, or need to care for family. Instead, they’re told to keep working as long as they test negative, and are still subject to a pandemic ban on health workers leaving the country. Chen says authorities are addressing the issues in hospitals, but concedes Taiwan didn’t prepare an adequate supply of rapid tests, and still don’t have enough despite growing official reliance on them. On Monday, in response to mounting criticism, the government reverted to allowing some retail stores to sell non-rationed tests at market prices, but it didn’t have access to brand details or supply levels. There is generally widespread support for Taiwan’s efforts. Perhaps one of the biggest hurdles for the “new Taiwanese model” was to flip the narrative from a fear-filled zero-Covid commitment to gradual coexistence. The lower severity of Omicron has helped, says Chen. Taiwan also came under more pressure to reopen after cautious neighbours like South Korea and Japan joined the US and Europe in opening. Recent polling by the Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation found an almost even split of 45% in favour of a coexistence policy compared to 46.3% who weren’t. In July 2021 – at the tail end of the Alpha outbreak – 58.8% of people were worried the government was lifting restrictions too soon. Support for the CECC and minister Chen’s handling of Covid has also increased in that time, from 66.4% of respondents to 77.7%. Yen says government messaging has been “well disseminated and transparent”. “People are not happy about the deficiencies in testing kit supply, and they are crowding in emergency departments but this can all be improved,” he says. Yen says “there will of course be casualties”, but waiting out the worst of the pandemic until vaccines, treatments and a milder strain came along has brought them a long way. Taiwan is no longer the poster child for zero-Covid, but is hoping it can model something else instead – a calm and steady transition to rejoin the world after more than two years locked away.

5/9/2022,"The second leaders debate of the federal election quickly became bogged down in a slanging match of claim and counter-claim on Sunday night. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, and Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, each attempted to live factcheck their opponent but time-limit rules, often highly restrictive, moved the cut and thrust on before either was prepared to concede the point or both could agree on central facts. We’ve revisited five of the biggest clangers of the second debate to sort fact from fiction. On aged care, there was a pair of howlers from the leaders, both seeking to grab credit for the royal commission. Morrison declared “I was the one who blew the whistle”, in reference to calling the royal commission in September 2018. That seems like a gross embellishment, when the abuses and neglect in aged care were already well known at the time, particularly through reporting on the Oakden aged care centre in South Australia, which had already been examined by a Senate inquiry. Albanese responded that the government had called a royal commission “under pressure from the Labor party” which “took it to elections”. “You did it reluctantly because you lost the numbers on the floor of the parliament,” he said. Albanese appears to have been mistakenly referring to the banking royal commission, which Labor took to the 2016 election and several government MPs threatened to support before the Turnbull government reluctantly called one in November 2017. Although the Coalition did resist the aged care royal commission for many months, Labor never took the policy to an election, and the then leader, Bill Shorten, declined to support one in June 2018, just months before it was called. Asked if he had ever seen any corruption on his side of politics, Morrison boldly responded: “No, I haven’t.” Panellist David Crowe gave a quick example: the New South Wales branch funnelling donations through the Free Enterprise Foundation to subvert state donations laws. Morrison replied that the question assumed he had “some knowledge or awareness or involvement in those issues”. So, provided a politician doesn’t read front-page news stories alleging corruption in their own party, they can say they’ve never seen it. Right. That’s before one gets to the $100m sports rorts saga and $660m for commuter car parks – both blasted by the auditor general, with the car parks scheme described as “amount[ing] to corruption” by a former New South Wales auditor general during a Senate inquiry. Albanese also overreached by claiming “oppositions don’t draft legislation, governments do”. He was on firmer footing claiming there would have been no point in doing so, because the government wouldn’t allow a Labor bill to be voted on or debated. Early on, Chris Uhlmann challenged Albanese over whether it was a lie to claim he “wasn’t given the opportunity” to give the six points of Labor’s NDIS policy. Albanese replied: “No, it wasn’t.” At a media conference on Thursday, Albanese was interrupted several times when asked for the six points, because his answer was not directly responsive to the question. Albanese said the six points were “outlined by Bill Shorten” and “all around the theme of putting people at the centre of the NDIS”. But, ultimately, Albanese chose to give the call to another journalist despite being asked four times for the points. It is not true to say he wasn’t given the opportunity to answer. Albanese said when Morrison was a minister the Port of Darwin was “sold to a company with links to the Chinese Communist party”. When Morrison responded that the commonwealth had no role, Albanese said it was his party – the Country Liberal party in the Northern Territory – who had sold it and Morrison had “ticked it off”. Morrison is correct that the Foreign Investment Review Board did not have direct power to veto the deal but federal agencies including the defence department and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation could have raised concerns, and did not. The commonwealth has legislative power to override territory governments, and later gave itself powers to veto deals with sub-national governments that don’t fit Australia’s foreign policy – which could now be used to reverse the deal. Morrison started the debate by saying Australia had “faced down 15% unemployment”. As Treasury officials told the Senate Covid committee in April 2020, unemployment was projected to reach 10% by mid 2020, 5% lower than it might have been without jobkeeper wage subsidies. In fact, unemployment peaked at 7.5% in July 2020. So while it’s true that Australia faced down the prospect of 15% unemployment, it is an exaggeration based on a projected scenario. Note that when the government claims it saved 40,000 lives from Covid, it is measuring itself against the OECD average, not worst case projections like 50,000 to 150,000 possible deaths in Australia. The same should apply for unemployment.",News/Australia news,Second leaders’ debate factcheck: the five biggest clangers in Morrison v Albanese,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/09/second-leaders-debate-factcheck-the-five-biggest-clangers-in-morrison-v-albanese
5/9/2022,"Nationals minister Bridget McKenzie has refused to say whether the junior Coalition partner would block any increased ambition on climate policy in the event Scott Morrison attempted to form a minority government with the support of teal independents after 21 May. Despite facing multiple questions about the Nationals’ position on the ABC on Monday morning, McKenzie declined to be candid about whether or not her party would accept any increase in the government’s widely criticised medium term emissions reduction target. While the Nationals ended up signing on to Morrison’s commitment of net zero emissions by 2050, MPs remain publicly split on the target, with Matt Canavan characterising the pledge to the United Nations as “dead” and the Nationals’ candidate in Flynn characterising net zero as a flexible non-binding plan that leaves plenty of “wriggle room”. During last year’s Nationals party room debate on net zero, the party leader, Barnaby Joyce, made it clear to colleagues he didn’t support the mid-century target. The Nationals also vetoed Morrison’s attempt to increase the 2030 target in the run-up to the Glasgow climate conference last year. Asked whether the Nationals would flex their muscle post-election to block more ambitious Coalition climate policy commitments in return for undertakings from the crossbench about confidence and supply, McKenzie stepped around the point: “We are committed to moving towards net zero by 2050”. “We are looking forward to the opportunities that will provide our communities,” she said. “At the end of the day, rural and regional Australia – and this has been, I think, they thing that has been forgotten for the decade of the so-called climate wars – it was always going to be the regions that ended up paying the price."" “We’ve been able to broker an outcome because the Liberal and National parties work together, unlike the Labor party.” Pressed on whether the Nationals would countenance a change in the Coalition’s medium-term emissions reduction target to stay in government, McKenzie declared: “I’m not dealing in hypotheticals.” This is not a hypothetical. As pre-poll voting opened on Monday, the latest opinion polls have Labor in front of the government, but strategists on both sides think there is a significant risk of a hung parliament given polls also suggest a chunk of voters are looking to support a candidate from outside the major parties. The teal independents have been entirely clear they want a more ambitious medium-term emissions reduction target in the event any of them making it to parliament. McKenzie avoided answering the question by reverting to a Coalition talking point. “The prime minister has made it very, very clear, the worst outcome for our nation is a hung parliament, and the last time a minority government was formed with rural independents it decimated the regions on a whole range of policy fronts,” she said. “It is not the best outcome.” McKenzie’s contention about the decimation of regional electorates during the last minority parliament is incorrect. During the 43rd parliament, the two rural independents McKenzie cited – Tony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott – delivered significant new investments in their northern New South Wales regions courtesy of concessions extracted from Labor in return for their support in confidence and supply votes. The two faced a backlash in their regions for supporting a Labor government, not for failing to deliver infrastructure and services for their communities. McKenzie on Monday sought to diminish the climate focused independents with a sexist slur. She characterised the teal independents – all women – as “Simon Holmes à Court’s groupies”. Holmes à Court runs the Climate 200 group which has raised funds to help bankroll some of the political campaigns against incumbent Liberals in the major cities. Challenged on the sexist slur, McKenzie said she noted the independents didn’t want to be called a political party: “I’m very very happy to call them Simon Homes à Court’s political party if you like.” A key attack line in the teal campaigns is it is pointless to support moderate Liberals like Dave Sharma or Trent Zimmerman, because ultimately they vote the same way as Barnaby Joyce. McKenzie was asked whether the Nationals’ longstanding obduracy on climate action was actually a key contributor to the rise of the climate-focused independents. The Nationals minister suggested that wasn’t a factor. “We’ve been able to broker a fantastic result around climate change, actually bringing the regions, which would have been the communities adversely affected by decarbonisation, by net zero – we’ve been able to develop plans for rural and regional Australians that they’ll be able to seize the opportunities that net zero by 2050 will provide them,” she said. “We’re absolutely focused on fighting for a number one against a Liberal if you’ve got a Liberal candidate in your electorate and a number one if you’ve got a National.”",News/Australia news,Bridget McKenzie won’t say whether Nationals would block stronger climate targets in minority negotiations,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/09/bridget-mckenzie-wont-say-whether-nationals-would-block-stronger-climate-targets-in-minority-negotiations
5/9/2022,"Huon Aquaculture accounted for the deaths of at least three-quarters of seals killed at Tasmanian salmon farms since the start of last year, with new data showing the company released more than 8,000 underwater explosives aimed at scaring the seals. Government data released in response to a right-to-information request revealed Huon Aquaculture, now owned by the controversial Brazilian meat company JBS, used 8,057 underwater explosives against seals in the 15 months to the end of March. The company accounted for 18 of the 23 seal deaths over the period. Under Tasmanian laws, companies are allowed to use underwater explosives, known as “seal crackers”, which can scare seals with loud noise and a flash of light. Other authorised measures include shooting seals with fabric-coated plastic shells containing lead shot, known as bean bag rounds, and darts with blunt tips known as “scare caps”. The data released by the Department Natural Resources and Environment showed the salmon industry has used more than 125,000 explosive devices since 2016. Between the first and second halves of the 15 months, Tassal and Petuna slashed their use of explosive devices by more than 75%. Huon Aquaculture went in the opposite direction, increasing its use by more than 10%. Huon Aquaculture did not respond directly when asked why its use of seal crackers remained high while the other two companies had reduced their use. The company pointed to a January 2021 backgrounder that said “our use of crackers has increased as a result of our expansion into offshore waters in Storm Bay; additional fish in the water equals more seals. If bait fish (mackerel) schools increase, as they often do in Storm Bay and the [D’Entrecasteaux] Channel, increasing incidents of opportunistic seals attempting to breach pen perimeters occur.” JBS completed its $425m purchase of Huon Aquaculture in mid-November 2021, fending off a rival takeover bid lodged by Tattarang, a private company owned by mining magnate Andrew Forrest. As part of its takeover campaign, JBS vowed Huon Aquaculture would “uphold the highest standards of fish health and sustainable farming practices”. Bec Howarth, a fish farm and marine campaigner with the Bob Brown Foundation, said Huon Aquaculture’s “continued high level of use of deafening seal crackers” indicated “JBS has already broken their commitment to cause no environmental harm”. The company did not respond directly to a question on why seal deaths on its leases accounted for such a large share of the total seal death toll. The department said seal deaths at salmon farms could be caused by a range of factors, including entanglement in netting, being struck by vessels, using deterrents and being euthanised. In one document released to Environment Tasmania in early 2021, government wildlife biologist Sam Thalmann wrote that salmon company estimates of seal deaths due to the use of approved deterrents were “likely a large underestimate as many seals with injury/penetrating wounds resulting from deterrents would leave the area and die outside the lease area”. The latest data also revealed that neither Petuna, the smallest of the three salmon producers, nor Huon Aquaculture, used bean bag rounds against seals. Petuna reported no seal deaths on its leases. Tassal is the only salmon producer still using bean bag rounds, but its reliance on them declined dramatically over the past year.

5/9/2022,"There are places in Brisbane where you can still see the tide mark; parts of the city where business remain closed and where temporary fences still surround kids’ playgrounds. “Given that people here are visibly, physically witnessing and experiencing what are most likely the effects of man-made climate change, it would bring it to the forefront of people’s minds when they go to vote,” says John Pittendreigh, a bike shop owner from Rosalie in Brisbane’s northern suburbs. Two months ago, floodwater about 1.2m high came through the shop, which sits at the western end of the electorate of Brisbane. The seat takes in the CBD and the inner-northern suburbs, including several areas which were badly affected by the March “rain bomb” downpour. Pittendreigh says he won’t vote for either of the major parties over their inaction, or lack of ambition, to deal with climate change. “I get a bit tired of hearing the powers that be say that we can’t afford to go to net zero. Because can we afford to cope with floods like this, fires like we’ve had every few years?” he says. “It’s kind of like, what all those people have been saying for the last 20, 30, 40 years, it’s manifesting right now. And of course it’s going to make a difference to how people vote.” Brisbane has changed hands a few times in recent decades, but since 2010 has been held by the Liberal National party. Incumbent Trevor Evans, the former National Retail Association boss and a relatively moderate Liberal, was first elected in 2016. The seat feels harder to pigeon-hole than inner-city electorates in other major capitals. Brisbane brings together apartment-dwellers in the CBD and Fortitude Valley; trendy and leafy areas like New Farm and Paddington; and a few affluent Liberal-leaning suburbs like Clayfield, Ascot and Hendra. Evans holds the seat by 4.9%, but it has become a key target for both Labor, which has preselected local businesswoman Madonna Jarrett, and the Greens’ candidate, the sales assistant and social science graduate Stephen Bates. Harrison Munday and Alisa Enomoto moved to Brisbane from the Gold Coast last year. They say the cost of living was a key concern that could win their vote. “Every time we’ve moved into a new apartment we end up in a smaller place, but paying way more,” Enomoto says. “I’d like to see more chances for younger people to buy houses, we’re renting and we’re looking to buy but it’s hard.” Munday, who works in construction, says petrol prices were a worry. “It’s getting harder and harder to move closer in to the city and still have an alright lifestyle.” Mini Compton lives in a sharehouse in the inner-north suburb of Red Hill. She says she was leaning towards the Greens, but was considering Labor because she liked the party’s shared home-ownership scheme. “I love the area, but the way property prices have gone up I couldn’t afford to buy here,” she says. Since the onset of the pandemic, people are moving to Queensland in droves – interstate migration is at its highest level in decades – and in some cases, bringing their politics with them. Markus Hofer and Kamon Miancharoen recently sold their home and business in Byron Bay and moved to New Farm. “I certainly wouldn’t vote for either Morrison or Albanese,” Hofer says. “Neither one of them are useful. “I will always vote for the Greens, not that we agree with all of their policies, which you never do, of course. But I think most of the major parties fail to recognise the pressing issues, like climate change, which will affect our children.” Ray O’Brien had an artery in his neck removed a few weeks ago; doctors have him a 40% chance of pulling through, he says. But a few weeks before election day the Fortitude Valley resident was back at the New Farm neighbourhood centre, where he comes for a toasted sandwich and a chat. He’d voted for Evans last time around, but this time he wasn’t sure. “I’d have to have a big think about it, you don’t want to jump,” he says. “I think Morrison, he’s always going to do something but never gets around to it.” Cindy Riches says she’s met Evans before and likes him, but won’t vote for the LNP because of environmental concerns. “I like him personally, but maybe not his politics,” she says. “I’ve pretty much always known who I was going to vote for, but I think it could change. I’ve changed my mind quite a few times already. “I think Morrison did some good things. We’ve never had a pandemic before and there was a while where everyone was having a go at him and I didn’t like that, because he was going the best he can. But then it felt like he really dropped the ball.” Daniel Lightfoot, a former business owner, says he’s happy with the government and will vote for the LNP. “I think the momentum that we’ve got up, we’ve got a world war on, everything we’ve got on, it’s too much, we can’t afford too much change. “You can’t be happy all the time, nobody’s perfect, but I think Morrison is having a fair crack. “I quite like the way he operates.

5/9/2022,"Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy confirmed that 60 people who were sheltering in a school in Bilohorivka, near the eastern city of Luhansk, were killed when Russian forces bombed it this weekend. The UN has condemned the attack, with secretary general António Guterres saying he was “appalled” by it. More than 170 civilians were successfully evacuated from the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol and have arrived in Zaporizhzhia. Officials said that more than 600 people have been evacuated from the plant and from Mariupol in total. Members of Ukraine’s Azov battalion trapped inside the Azovstal steel plant meanwhile said they fear they will be killed if captured by Russian forces, as they pleaded with Ukrainian authorities to help arrange their extraction. Speaking to the media from inside the besieged steelworks, Lt Illya Samoilenko vowed to fight on, saying that surrender would be a “gift” to the enemy. US president Joe Biden and other G7 leaders held a video call with Zelenskiy in a show of unity ahead of Russia’s Victory Day celebrations on Monday. The G7 said it was committed to phasing out or banning Russian oil and denounced president Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. “His actions bring shame on Russia and the historic sacrifices of its people,” the group said in a statement, referring to Soviet Russia’s role in defeating Nazi Germany 77 years ago. New US visa bans on more than 2,600 Russian and Belarusian military officials include personnel believed to have operated in Bucha, the town outside Kyiv that has become synonymous with war crimes, US secretary of state Antony Blinken said. America’s top diplomat to Ukraine, Kristina Kvien, arrived with her team in Kyiv on Sunday in a step towards resuming the country’s presence in the capital. The visit was timed to commemorate Victory in Europe Day. Russian airstrikes on Sunday wounded one woman and knocked out electricity to six settlements in the Odesa region, authorities said. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau promised new weapons and other equipment for Ukraine after a surprise visit to the country during which he toured Irpin, a Kyiv suburb and scene of some of the worst early attacks by Russia. He also said Canada would remove trade tariffs on all Ukrainian imports for next year. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said Berlin had “made a mistake” after it banned all flags, including Ukrainian flags, as part of its decision to suppress all displays of public support for the Russian invasion on Victory Day. “Taking a Ukrainian flag away from peaceful protesters is an attack on everyone who now defends Europe and Germany from Russian aggression with this flag in hands,” he said. The US president’s wife, Jill Biden, met with Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, on another unannounced visit on Sunday to mark Mother’s Day, while U2’s Bono and the Edge performed in a Kyiv bomb shelter. In an address to mark Ukraine’s 8 May remembrance and reconciliation day, Zelenskiy said his country paid homage to all those who helped defeat Adolf Hitler but accused Russia of repeating his crimes. “This year we say ‘Never again’ differently. We hear ‘Never again’ differently. It sounds painful, cruel. Without an exclamation, but with a question mark. You say: never again? Tell Ukraine about it.” Ukraine will prevail over Russia as freedom prevailed over the Nazi dictatorship in 1945, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has said in a TV address to mark the 77th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day. Scholz, whose relations with Zelenskiy have been frosty, has not yet said whether he will accept an invitation to travel to Kyiv on Monday. The US has unveiled a new layer of sanctions on Russia, targeting services, Russia’s propaganda machine and its defence industry. They are primarily intended to close loopholes in the existing sanctions and to tighten the noose around the Russian economy by another few notches. The UK government has expanded its sanctions against Russia to include punitive import tariffs on Russian precious metals, as well as export bans on certain UK products, to increase economic pressure on Moscow. Putin’s regime is “mirroring” the actions of the Nazis, the UK’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, will say on Monday as the Russian leader stages a military parade to celebrate Russia’s second world war victory, according to an advance copy of the speech. Wallace will say Putin and his inner circle should share the same fate as the Nazis, who ended up defeated and facing the Nuremberg trials for their atrocities.

5/9/2022,"Attack ads targeting Labor are being published without any authorisation or party attribution on the Chinese-language social networking platform, WeChat, raising concerns that misinformation could be circulating without oversight. The advertisements, which include false suggestions Labor’s policies involve a raft of new taxes, appear on the WeChat site of Chinese-language media outlet Australian Financial News, alongside highly flattering articles about the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg. The Commonwealth Electoral Act requires paid electoral advertisements to be authorised, with a breach of the Act attracting a penalty of up to $26,650. But the Australian Electoral Commission said it is “not proactively monitoring WeChat in this election”. Australians of Chinese heritage could play a pivotal role in the outcome of the election, as they have in previous years, especially as Australia’s fraught relationship with China becomes a central talking point of the campaign. As several marginal seats in Sydney and Melbourne with large Chinese-Australian populations hang in the balance, courting the community has become essential. A volunteer-run campaign against Labor conducted on WeChat during the 2016 election is thought to have been instrumental flipping the Labor-held seat of Chisholm to Liberal MP Julia Banks. During the 2019 campaign, Labor complained to WeChat about a high volume of misleading anti-Labor material, some of which could be traced back to Liberal Party members. One doctored tweet, purporting to come from then ALP leader Bill Shorten’s account, said: “Immigration of people from the Middle East is the future Australia needs.” The attack ads that appeared in April are designed in the same style as the Liberal party’s election ads, but without the required authorisation tagline. The ads feature an unflattering picture of opposition leader Anthony Albanese and list in Chinese a range of taxes. “Coal emission tax, traffic tax, retirement taxes, family business taxes and inheritance taxes,” the ads say in Chinese, with big crosses marked next to them. None of these taxes is current ALP policy. There are about 3 million users of WeChat in Australia; Australian Financial News is a mid-tier site, with stories attracting between 10,000 to 20,000 readers. The site also features a video ad supporting Frydenberg’s campaign featuring the treasurer’s dry cleaner, Eddie, who is of Chinese descent, saying how important jobkeeper was to his business during the Covid-19 crisis. This ad carries the required authorisation. Accompanying the ads are highly flattering news stories about Frydenberg, which have appeared on multiple websites. A spokesperson for Frydenberg’s campaign said they had paid for banner advertisements on Australian Financial News promoting the Morrison government’s economic record and plan for a stronger future. They said they had not paid for the soft editorial that accompanied them. “Information on Anthony Albanese’s record of supporting higher taxes on Australians has also been featured through banner advertising,” the spokesperson said, but did not address the lack of authorisation. Authorities and campaigns have been on the lookout for “fake news” circulating on social media emanating from political rivals and state-sponsored actors, but the damage can often be wrought before the parties become aware of it. The ABC has uncovered highly misleading posts recently spreading on WeChat, depicting a shadowy image of a spy figure and claims that eight Chinese figures who support Labor are under investigation for election interference by the “Australian Intelligence Bureau”. There is no such agency in Australia. The post, written in Chinese, was reportedly circulated by a group of Liberal party supporters to more than a dozen closed WeChat groups, reaching thousands of Chinese-speaking voters in marginal seats in Australia’s east coast cities. The AEC said it takes a graduated approach to enforcement, noting that most authorisation matters can be technical in nature. “We monitor a range of social media channels but are not proactively monitoring WeChat this election,” the AEC spokesperson said. “The vast majority of authorisations matters are brought to our attention swiftly by other social media users and political participants (we are not lacking in people who refer content to us to review).” But the real risk is likely to come in the coming weeks, as it did in the 2019 campaign, through “fake news” being spread via private WeChat chat groups, which are difficult to monitor. Fergus Ryan, a senior analyst with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute’s International Cyber Policy Centre, said the most effective strategy to spread election messaging would be for “supporters and their proxies to use their own personal accounts to feed material into WeChat groups, because that’s where the activity takes place. It’s similar to WhatsApp groups.” Chinese-Australian media have reported a high level of interest in the 2022 campaign among readers after the prime minister, Scott Morrison, stepped up his rhetoric about the importance of protecting Australia’s national security, while his defence minister, Peter Dutton, warned Australia should prepare for war with China. Whether this will translate into a rush towards Labor remains to be seen, but the community will likely play a critical role in a raft of vigorously contested seats: Chisholm, Deakin and Kooyong in Victoria, and Reid, Parramatta, Banks, North Sydney and Bennelong in NSW. Martin Ma is the editor-in-chief of Sydney Today/Melbourne Today, which is among the most popular and influential Chinese-language online publications in Australia. “The [Australia-China] relationship is one of the most important [issues] in the election among the community,” Ma said. “The prevailing view is that we should protect Australian values but that doesn’t mean we have to fight straight against China. Most of our audience are first-generation migrants from mainland China. People love their hometown, they don’t want to see conflicts between Australia and China.” While online polls can be manipulated through multiple voting by people with vested interests, and they do not adjust for demographics who are not regularly online, a recent Sydney Today poll showed that in early voting 77% of respondents were favouring Labor, and nearly half said they would change their vote this time. The poll has been running since 29 April. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Of the respondents, 14% said Australia’s relationship with China was important to their vote, ahead of economic management at 13%. Over 58% wanted to see an Australia-China policy of “seeking common ground while respecting differences to improve bilateral relations”, as opposed to only 10% support for the current stance of “abiding by Australia’s interests”. Sydney Today has been publishing regular stories about the election that it considers relevant to its audience. Many stories are translations of articles from English-language media or compilations of articles. “We stand in the middle and let people hear the voices from different sides. We have been interviewing Chinese-Australians and asking them how they vote,” Ma said. “We did a piece with nine people on the street by random: four supporting Labor, five Liberal. I think this election is going to be a close competition according to the representation of the community – there are different views.”",News/Australia news,Unattributed attack ads targeting Labor on Chinese-language WeChat fuel fears of election misinformation,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/09/unattributed-attack-ads-targeting-labor-on-chinese-language-wechat-fuel-fears-of-misinformation

Opinion surveys suggest Marcos Jr, known as Bongbong, is poised to win the election, despite his family’s notorious history of human rights abuses and corruption. The Marcoses plundered as much as $10bn from the state, while thousands of his opponents were arrested, tortured and killed. Analysts say the Marcoses and their supporters have harnessed the power of social media to rebrand the family name and spread disinformation that downplays or denies past atrocities. False claims have been spread widely online, portraying Marcos Sr’s rule as a golden age of prosperity and peace. Marcos Jr denies any coordinated online network. Marcos Jr has not apologised for his family’s political history, and instead praised his father as a “political genius”, and his mother, Imelda, as the dynasty’s “supreme politician” during a recent interview. Imelda Marcos, infamous for her collection of 3,000 pairs of shoes, is appealing against a 2018 criminal conviction on seven graft charges. Marcos Jr, whose slogan is “together we shall rise again”, has campaigned with a message of unity and rekindling a former greatness. He is running in tandem with the daughter of populist president Rodrigo Duterte, Sara, who is vying for the vice-presidency, an arrangement that has further boosted the Marcos camp. President Duterte remains popular as he nears the end of his six-year term limit, despite attracting condemnation from rights groups over his bloody so-called “war on drugs”. He has not endorsed a presidential candidate. Opinion surveys suggest Marcos is far ahead of his opponents. One recent poll found he was the preferred candidate of 56% of respondents. Marcos’ biggest threat is Leni Robredo, the current vice-president and a former pro bono human rights lawyer, who has promised good and competent governance. As vice-president – a position elected separately from the president – she has frequently clashed with president Rodrigo Duterte, and has condemned his “war on drugs”, which has killed as many as 30,000 people according to some estimates, and prompted an investigation by the international criminal court. Robredo’s campaign has gathered momentum in the run-up to the election, with large crowds attending her rallies and almost 2 million people, many of them young voters, volunteering to go door to door to win support for her campaign. About 67 million people are eligible to vote, with polling stations opening from 6am on Monday for a longer period of 13 hours to ensure social distancing. Vote counting will begin as soon as the ballots close, and in the past the winner has become apparent within hours. However, some analysts say Covid measures may slow down the process this year, and have speculated that the race could be tighter than polling suggests, pointing to the large turnouts at Robredo’s rallies. The Philippine police and military said on Sunday they were on high alert ahead of the vote, with the armed forces chief, Lt Gen Andres Centino, stating they were committed to ensuring “secure, accurate, free and fair elections”.The winner will take office on 30 June and lead for a single, six-year term.",News/World news,Philippines election 2022: voting begins to decide next president ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/philippines-presidential-election-2022-voting-begins-leni-robredo-ferdinand-bongbong-marcos-jr-polls-open-president
5/9/2022,"More than 2 million adults in the UK have gone without food for a whole day over the past month because they cannot afford to eat, according to a survey revealing the “catastrophic” impact of the cost of living crisis. The latest survey of the nation’s food intake shows a 57% jump in the proportion of households cutting back on food or skipping meals over the first three months of this year, with one in seven adults (7.3 million) estimated to be food-insecure, up from 4.7 million in January. The shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, described the findings as devastating, saying they exposed how families were being left in desperate hardship. “Boris Johnson is responsible for this crisis and has no solutions to fix it,” he said. The survey came as one of Britain’s biggest energy suppliers called for urgent government action to help households cope with an anticipated £1,000 rise in bills this winter. The London fire brigade, meanwhile, was forced to issue an urgent safety warning against improvising fires at home, after a man set fire to his house by burning timber in his living room to keep warm. The research by the Food Foundation thinktank found millions more people – including 2.6 million children – report they now have smaller meals than usual, regularly skip meals altogether or do not eat when they are hungry, as food insecurity returns to levels last seen at the start of the first national lockdown. However, while many reported missing out on meals or eating irregularly during the first months of the pandemic because of food scarcity caused by panic buying and supply problems, the latest increase is put down to rising costs and poverty. Food banks are reporting that energy costs are so prohibitive for some people they request that charity food parcels that contain no food that has to be cooked using a cooker or that needs to be stored in a fridge or freezer. The rapid deterioration in food security reflects soaring energy, food and petrol prices coupled with below-inflation benefit rises. The Food Foundation said it was so shocked by its initial findings that it reran the survey on a wider basis, only to get the same results. It predicted food insecurity figures were likely to get worse over the next few months as inflation continues to rise and the full impact of April’s national insurance rise hits family budgets along with the lifting of the energy price cap. Anna Taylor, the foundation’s executive director, said: “The extremely rapid rise in food insecurity since January points to a catastrophic situation for families. Food insecurity puts families under extreme mental stress and forces people to survive on the cheapest calories, which lead to health problems.” Prof Sir Michael Marmot, a public health expert at University College London, said: “If one household in seven is food insecure, society is failing in a fundamental way. These figures on food insecurity are all the more chilling because the problem is soluble, but far from being solved it is getting worse.” There is little expectation that ministers will raise benefits or expand free school meals anytime soon, despite rising public concern over the cost of living. Last week, George Eustice, the environment, food and rural affairs secretary, urged consumers to switch to value brands to save on grocery spending in response to rising food prices. “Bless him [Eustice], he’s actually aware there are cheaper brand foods in the world. The poor man, who has lived such a sheltered life he thought 10p off a tin of beans would solve the problem,” said Kathleen Kerridge, an office manager and food activist from Portsmouth. On the food poverty frontline, charities are warning that demand for food is rising as budgets get tighter. Ellen-Scarlett Ryan, of Bassetlaw food bank in Worksop, said it supplied 24 households with food parcels on the day after Easter last month, way ahead of its previous record of 16. Many of these clients had never before used food banks and were struggling with their newfound reliance on charity to feed their families, Ryan said. “We are finding people in floods of tears. They are so scared, they are at their wits’ end. It is such a difficult and emotional time.” Households were making the food go further, she said, putting smaller portions on the table and bulking out dishes with lentils and rice. A growing number were asking for food that did not require cooking with the gas on, as they could not afford to put cash in the meter. On Monday Keith Anderson, the chief executive of Scottish Power, said a fresh support package would be vital before a further dramatic increase in the cost of gas and electricity bills due in October. A government spokesperson said: “We recognise the pressures on the cost of living and we are doing what we can to help, including spending £22bn across the next financial year to support people with energy bills and cut fuel duty. “For the hardest hit, we’re putting an average of £1,000 more per year into the pockets of working families on universal credit, have also boosted the minimum wage by more than £1,000 a year for full-time workers and our household support fund is there to help with the cost of everyday essentials.”",News/Society,"More than 2m adults in UK cannot afford to eat every day, survey finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/09/more-than-2m-adults-in-uk-cannot-afford-to-eat-every-day-survey-finds
5/9/2022,"Universities across England have come out against proposals for limiting student numbers and access to loans, describing the plans as likely to crush aspirations and entrench disadvantage. Responding to the government’s consultation, the three main university groups have lined up with the National Union of Students in opposing plans to limit undergraduates taking “low value” courses and stop students from receiving government-backed tuition fee and maintenance loans if they do not have minimum GCSE or A-level grades. Universities UK (UUK), which represents the leaders of mainstream universities in England, said it “strongly opposes” any introduction of number caps, saying it would most hurt those from disadvantaged backgrounds. “As well as limiting student choice, student number caps entrench disadvantage because students who are unable to move location to attend university have fewer opportunities to apply and be accepted to university, making them more likely to choose a path with poorer employment outcomes,” UUK said. Disadvantaged students are also among those likely to be most affected by minimum eligibility requirements for loans. UUK warned that the restrictions would have “significant financial implications” for universities, “limiting their ability to provide support for their disadvantaged students and invest locally”. Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that restricting loans to students with GCSE passes in maths and English, as suggested in the government’s consultation, would have a disproportionate impact on ethnic minority students as well as students who had received free school meals. Larissa Kennedy, the NUS president said: “This government parrots the language of ‘levelling up’ but these proposals are classist, ableist and racist: they cruelly target those from marginalised communities and seek to gatekeep education.” The University Alliance (UA), representing the UK’s leading professional and technical universities such as Coventry and Teesside, said the proposals “will only serve to crush aspiration and exacerbate disadvantage”, jeopardising graduate numbers in key areas such as social work and computer science. The UA also attacked the proposal to cut funding for students taking foundation year courses, saying they would make the courses unviable and harming disadvantaged and mature students who used them to enter higher education. Vanessa Wilson, the UA’s chief executive, said: “The areas of focus for the proposed higher education reforms are way off the mark and, if implemented, the casualties … will be the poorest and most disadvantaged in society.” Rachel Hewitt, the chief executive of the MillionPlus group – which represents modern universities such as Bath Spa and the University of Cumbria – said the policies had “profound and far-reaching implications”. “MillionPlus remains fundamentally opposed to minimum entry requirements, which are against the core principles of inclusion, aspiration and the power of education,” Hewitt said. “Universities are best placed to make a determination as to the suitability of each candidate on their own merits. On a purely practical level, minimum requirements are likely to be unworkable, due to the number of exemptions that would need to be taken into account, for example for students with special educational needs.” In response, a Department for Education spokesperson said: “We have not proposed to bar anyone from going to university: rather, we are starting a conversation on minimum entry requirements and asking whether young people should be pushed straight into a full degree, without being prepared for that level of study. “We are proposing exemptions for mature students, those with a foundation year, or appropriate certificate or diploma and are supporting these alternative routes through consulting on reducing the cost of foundation years and through our new lifelong loan entitlement, which will provide many different routes to improve a person’s career and life opportunities. “These exemptions would mean 1% or fewer of total entrants would be affected by either of the minimum eligibility requirement proposals. “Similarly, the government is not proposing to cap the overall number of people going to university and recognises the transformational power of higher education. We are, however, consulting on how we might prevent low quality courses with poor outcomes from growing uncontrollably.” However, the DfE’s own equality impact assessment of the proposals found that restricting access to loans “would disproportionately affect students who are black and from ethnic minority groups”. Black students account for 27% of those enrolled with no GCSE pass grades in English and maths, compared with 8% of students who would be exempt.",News/Education,Universities oppose plan for student cap and loans in England,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/09/universities-oppose-plan-for-student-cap-and-loans-in-england
5/9/2022,"The government must introduce legislation to protect child social media influencers from exploitation, according to MPs. The rise of influencers has produced a new outlet for the UK’s creative industries and boosted the UK economy but it has also brought considerable risks, said the House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee. Julian Knight, the Conservative chair of the committee, said the phenomenon had exposed influencers and their followers to harm. “The rise of influencer culture online has brought significant new opportunities for those working in the creative industries and a boost to the UK economy,” he said. “However, as is so often the case where social media is involved, if you dig below the shiny surface of what you see on screen you will discover an altogether murkier world where both the influencers and their followers are at risk of exploitation and harm online.” Influencers produce content on platforms such as YouTube, Instagram and TikTok for followers who often run into the millions. The biggest influencers in the UK include Zoe Sugg, a fashion and beauty “vlogger” whose YouTube channel has 4.9 million subscribers, Brooklyn Beckham and a procession of contestants on reality shows such as Love Island. However, the report raised specific concerns around children, influencer pay and the flouting of advertising guidelines that require creators to inform users when they have been paid to make a post. The MPs raised concerns about child influencers, or “kidfluencers”, who earn income through sponsorship and partnership with brands. The content is mostly aimed at other children and, because the minimum age for an Instagram account or setting up a YouTube channel is 13, many of these accounts are managed by parents. Children are also involved in content from family or parenting influencers. According to one estimate, there are at least 10,000 parent influencers in the UK and one witness told MPs that the UK was “notable” for its prevalence of child influencers. However, the committee said it had heard concerns from witnesses that some children are being used by parents to capitalise on the lucrative child and family influencing market. The report recommends that the government “urgently” addresses gaps in UK child labour and performance regulations that are leaving child influencers unprotected. New legislation should include provisions on working hours and conditions and protecting a child’s earnings. “We are deeply concerned that a lack of action in the booming influencer market will lead to even more children in the industry being exploited,” said the report. The report also addresses a key earner for influencers: being paid by brands to promote their products. This practice has drawn warnings from the UK advertising watchdog, which is concerned that some influencers are not admitting when they are being paid to promote certain content. The report recommends that the Advertising Standards Authority is given statutory power to enforce its codes, which ban putting up a paid-for post and not declaring that it is an advert. Currently, the organisation can “name and shame” transgressors, but not fine them. The report also recommends giving the competition watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority, greater powers to enforce consumer protection law. Although social media influencing is a booming business – with global marketing revenue expected to rise from $6bn in 2020 to $24bn by 2025 – the report warned that pay is inconsistent for the vast majority of British influencers. The committee urged the government to launch an investigation into influencer pay. “The government should investigate pay standards and practice in the influencer marketplace. This should encompass the various revenue streams available to influencers, including deals between influencers and third parties as well as revenue-sharing mechanisms from the major social media platforms.”",News/Media,"UK must protect child influencers from exploitation, MPs say",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/09/uk-must-protect-child-influencers-exploitation-social-media
5/9/2022,"People should not try to reduce their energy bills by improvising open fires at home, fire chiefs have warned, after a man in south-west London set fire to his property by burning timber in his living room to keep warm. The man was trying to avoid putting on the central heating in his home, fire investigators said. Fuel poverty campaigners said the incident – one of at least 100 involving open fires, log burners and heaters in the capital in the last few months – laid bare “the harsh and dangerous reality of the cost-of-living crisis”. Issuing an urgent safety warning, the London fire brigade (LFB) said the cause of the blaze on 26 April had been determined as “involving an open fire being used instead of gas central heating.” It is understood to have also been caused by combustible items too close to an open fire. The London ambulance service said it treated three people at the property in New Malden, with one man being taken to hospital as a priority. The LFB said there had been more than 100 fires involving open fires, log burners and heaters in the past few months. It fears the rise in energy bills could result in a surge of fires as people resort to alternative means to heat their homes throughout the colder spells of the year.Charlie Pugsley, assistant commissioner for fire safety, said: “We know this is a difficult time and people are thinking about ways to reduce their energy bills, but we’re really concerned that they may be putting lives at risk by doing so. “If you do have a log burner or an open fire, follow our advice carefully. Almost 30% of fires involving log burners, heaters and traditional open fires are caused by items being placed too close to a heat source. Always use a fire guard and keep anything that could catch alight well away, such as logs and kindling which could be ignited by radiating heat.” Adam Scorer, the chief executive of the fuel poverty charity National Energy Action, described the incident as a “harsh and dangerous reality of the cost-of-living crisis”. “One in four UK households are now in fuel poverty, which means millions are facing impossible choices because of their high energy bills,” he said. “Some are choosing between heating and eating, others are self disconnecting completely and some are even starting open fires. These aren’t coping strategies. It’s people who feel they have no safe choice to make.”A government spokesperson said: “We recognise the pressures people are facing with the cost of living, which is why we have set out a £22bn package of support, including rebates and energy bill reductions.” ",News/UK news,London fire chiefs warn against fires in homes to save on heating bills ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/09/london-fire-chiefs-warn-against-fires-in-homes-to-save-on-heating-bills
5/9/2022,"The UK government has expanded its sanctions against Russia to include punitive import tariffs on Russian precious metals, as well as export bans on certain UK products, to increase economic pressure on Moscow over the invasion of Ukraine. The third wave of sanctions was announced by the Department for International Trade just hours ahead of Russia’s 9 May Victory Day celebrations, when the country celebrates the end of the second world war with military parades and when President Vladimir Putin is expected to repackage details of the war in Ukraine to citizens. The latest £1.7bn sanctions on Russia and neighbouring Belarus – which has joined in the invasion of Ukraine and been used as a base for Russian soldiers – are aimed at knocking Putin’s ability to fund his war. The announcement came shortly after G7 leaders, including Boris Johnson and US President Joe Biden, held a video call with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in a show of unity with the country ahead of the Kremlin’s Victory Day parades. The new package of restrictions includes £1.4bn of UK import tariffs – border taxes paid by buyers on goods shipped from Russia – that will affect imports of platinum, palladium and other products including chemicals from Russia. The international trade department said Russia was highly dependent on the UK for exports of the precious metals, which will be subject to additional 35 percentage point tariffs. The government will also ban the export of more than £250m of goods in sectors where the Russian economy is most dependent on UK products, including key materials like chemicals, plastics, rubber and machinery. The latest measures, announced by the international trade secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, bring the total value of products subject to full or partial trade sanctions since Russia’s invasion to more than £4bn. Previous rounds of measures have targeted the energy sector, and have also included an asset freeze on Russia’s largest bank, and sanctions against people and organisations principally involved with information and media. Trevelyan said: “This far-reaching package of sanctions will inflict further damage on the Russian war machine. “It is part of a wider coordinated effort by the many countries around the world who are horrified by Russia’s conduct and determined to bring to bear our economic might to persuade Putin to change course.” Sunak said: “Working closely with our allies, we can and will thwart Putin’s ambitions.”",News/World news,UK expands import sanctions against Russia and Belarus,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/08/uk-expands-import-sanctions-against-russia-and-belarus
5/9/2022,"The tequila has flowed freely this weekend in Miami as Formula One threw its all into hosting the party it wanted in order to celebrate its inaugural race here. By the time the chequered flag flew, Max Verstappen was unequivocal that he and his Red Bull team deserved a drink of their own having edged Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc into second place. The Dutchman had to come back against the odds after a trying weekend to deliver with consummate skill a victory that again proved beyond doubt just what a level he is operating at when he has the car he wants beneath him and a race by the scruff of the neck. In control at the Miami International Autodrome, he delivered an ice-cool performance on an afternoon baking in the Florida sunshine and amid huge expectations for this first race here, a key part of Formula One’s efforts to break America. To that end, after a weekend of showbiz, of wanting to present an entertainment spectacle right down to the construction of a fake yacht marina within the circuit, they finished it off by having Dan Marino handing out a trophy and the traditional winning caps replaced by American football helmets. All of which felt fitting: there are 23 races this season and F1 certainly has room for one of this flavour if, as it appears to do, it pleases the fans in the US. Certainly Verstappen felt like celebrating. “I think I need a drink, and I think you also need a drink,” he said to the team as he crossed the line. He had had to execute flawlessly to seal another ominously strong win and imbue his assault on the title with further momentum. With this, his third win of the season, Leclerc’s lead to Verstappen was cut from 27 to 19 points. Carlos Sainz was in third for Ferrari, with Mercedes enjoying an improved afternoon after recent travails with George Russell and Lewis Hamilton taking fifth and sixth. But Hamilton was unhappy with his team for offering him the chance to choose strategy options during the race. “In that scenario I have no clue where everyone is,” he said. “When the team says ‘it is your choice’, I don’t have the information to make the decision. That’s what your job is. Today they gave it to me and I didn’t understand it. I am excited at some stage to take a step forward, which we haven’t yet.” The victory for Verstappen had been far from a given over the weekend. He lost an enormous amount of time learning the new track after mechanical problems in practice and subsequently made a small error in qualifying that meant he could manage no better than third on the grid. Come the race his work was cut out but he proved from the off that he intended to be as feisty and decisive as ever. Starting from pole, Leclerc had held his lead into turn one but behind him Verstappen made his mark immediately, launching himself up the outside of Sainz in a superb move to claim second place. It was a vital pass for Verstappen to split the two Ferraris. The two title protagonists were once more quickly into a race of their own but Ferrari and Leclerc were under the cosh. With Leclerc’s tyres taking a pounding and having made an error in turn 17, Verstappen with dominant race pace once more made a decisive move up the inside of turn one on lap nine. Just as he had at the last round in Imola he had a lead that he never looked like surrendering. He enjoyed a more than two-second advantage by lap 12 and held his lead through the only pitstops. Ferrari were simply not in the fight and Verstappen was proving he is rarely prone to error when given freedom to dictate in clean air. Crucially however, the reigning champion showed his mettle once more in the dying stages. He held his place after a late safety car and while Leclerc stuck with him and pressured hard to the flag, he duly closed it out. This was recognisably the control and calm of a champion. Hamilton, watching after an afternoon when he was once more disappointed to be passed by Russell after his teammate was the beneficiary of a fresh tyres under the safety car, would be all too familiar with Verstappen’s serene delivery. Red Bull’s team principal Christian Horner paid tribute to the achievement. “Well done mate, you really made that work,” he said. “Well done for hanging on and we got fastest lap as well.” It was not perhaps quite the spectacle Miami had been hoping for but on this form Ferrari and Leclerc need to find more to take the fight to Verstappen. F1 will nonetheless consider its first outing in Miami a hit, certainly the sold-out event with 82,500 fans was embraced by them with huge enthusiasm. The grandstands roared to every move being made on track. Verstappen played the leading role in that success story and indeed now in F1’s racing history in the sunshine state. This was the first time a GP has been held in Florida since 1959, when Sebring played host and Jack Brabham clinched the title by pushing his fuelless car over the line to take fourth place.",Sport/Sport,Max Verstappen holds off challenge of Charles Leclerc to win Miami F1 GP,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/08/max-verstappen-holds-off-challenge-of-charles-leclerc-to-win-miami-grand-prix
5/9/2022,"With one exception, this year’s TV Baftas got things spectacularly right. It’s always hard to single out specific shows and personalities who are worthy of praise in an age when so much good television is being made but, credit where credit’s due, Bafta’s hit rate was almost impeccable. Of course Jamie Demetriou won best male comedy performance for Stath Lets Flats. For three seasons he has created less a performance and more a sheer gravitational force, terraforming an entire genre to his whims. And of course Matthew Macfadyen won best supporting actor for Succession. Because, for a performer once stereotyped as starched and staid, to see the full spectrum of colour he gave Tom Wambsgans – the tragedy and the duplicity, plus the pinpoint comic timing – is to see Macfadyen reach full capacity. So yes, with one exception the Baftas knocked it out of the park. And what a disastrous exception. It’s a Sin – the series that sauntered through the nominations as the year’s clearfrontrunner – came up short. In every single category. Its lack of success is genuinely bewildering. Not only was It’s a Sin an obvious labour of love for Russell T Davies, but it was a risk that paid off in almost every regard. Critics swooned at its feet and people watched it in swathes. It’s a Sin was the popular choice. It was the intellectual choice. It was even the political choice; because surely if you wanted to rub mud in the eye of anyone thinking of privatising Channel 4, you have no better weapon than a blockbuster series about the AIDS crisis. And yet, nothing. Now, we should probably be clear that this doesn’t represent a grand conspiracy. I’ve sat on Bafta juries before, and they’re all isolated. There wasn’t word from on high that It’s a Sin needed to be punished. What happened is that, in every single category that contained a nomination for It’s a Sin, a different group of people snubbed it. Who knows why. Perhaps they thought the show had already got enough love, and chose to put the spotlight on a less visible series. Maybe each category assumed It’s a Sin would walk every other category. Who knows? But whatever the reason, the defining television series of 2021 is now one of the least recognised. Which isn’t to say the shows that beat it are undeserving. Time, which won best mini-series, was tight and urgent and contained two stupendous performances at its heart. Sean Bean (who won best actor) was incredible in it, just as Jodie Comer (who won best actress) was incredible in Help. It isn’t as if It’s a Sin was egregiously robbed by an unworthy competitor. But not to won anything at all? That just makes Bafta look foolish. But this is a snubs and surprises piece, and not all surprises are bad. Who would have thought, going into this ceremony, that Big Zuu would emerge as one of the biggest winners? Zuu won twice, for best features and best entertainment performance, for Big Zuu’s Big Eats. If you haven’t seen Big Eats, this should be all the encouragement you need. It’s the kick in the arse that the cookery genre urgently required, and Big Zuu is one of the most likable, engaging faces on TV. Big Eats currently airs on Dave, but if this news doesn’t initiate a Taskmaster-style feeding frenzy then something will have gone terribly wrong. Whether you’d heard of him or not before now, it has become undeniable. Big Zuu is a star. It was also great to see some recognition for Together and Alma’s Not Normal. But, really, when anyone thinks of the 2022 television Baftas, they’re destined to only remember the staggering failure to recognise one of the defining shows in all of Channel 4 history.

There doesn’t seem to be one easy answer, writes James Colley. “At some point, I crossed the line from reader to hoarder and I need to go back … I know I’m never going back to finish them ... But coming to terms with this psychologically is only part of the battle.

5/9/2022,"One horse from the Aidan O’Brien stable replaced another on Sunday at the top of the market for the Derby next month, as Stone Age was cut to 3-1 favourite for the Classic following an easy win in Leopardstown’s Derby Trial just half an hour after the trainer had ruled out Luxembourg, third in last month’s 2,000 Guineas, due to a muscular problem. Stone Age, sent off favourite at 10-11, made most of the running under Ryan Moore and was a couple of lengths ahead turning for home. When Moore asked him for a finishing kick he quickly moved further clear of his field, eventually crossing the line five-and-a-half lengths clear of Glory Daze, an 18-1 outsider. It was O’Brien’s 15th success in the Leopardstown trial, though only two of his previous winners – Galileo and High Chaparral in 2000 and 2001 respectively – have followed up at Epsom. “I’ve always liked the horse,” Moore said afterwards. “He was very impressive at Navan and he’s beginning to put it together now. I think today’s trial was a good race and I think he’ll probably improve again, so he’s a very exciting colt. “He gave me a very good feel at Navan and he gave me a very good feel as a two-year-old, he ran in the [Group One] Lagardere at seven [furlongs] on bad ground and he wasn’t beaten far and wouldn’t have been seen to best effect in the conditions.” Stone Age was cut from 12-1 to a general 3-1 for the Derby on 4 June after Sunday’s race and seems sure to start favourite for the Classic unless Sir Michael Stoute’s Desert Crown (6-1) puts up an equally emphatic performance in the Dante Stakes at York on Thursday.

5/9/2022,"How do you mend a broken heart? Not literally, that is. If you’re Manchester City, your solution to a broken heart would probably be to spend £30m on hiring the 50 best heart surgeons in the world to defibrillate it for the next 10 years. But emotionally speaking, the time-honoured way of getting over a recent trauma is to surround yourself with loved ones, throw yourself into your work and rediscover the simple pleasures in life, which in City’s case usually involves dishing out merciless spankings to bottom-half Premier League sides. Here it was the unfortunate Newcastle United who would be City’s boxercise class, their family‑sized tub of Häagen‑Dazs, their 3am booty call to a long-lost ex. Of course the pall of Madrid hung over the afternoon. How could it not? It was less than 96 hours since their bone-chilling late defeat in the Champions League semi-final, and even as the goals rained in at the Etihad Stadium there was a strangely dolorous mood to the place, perhaps akin to the finger buffet at your grandmother’s funeral. Delicious, wholesome, but can you really fully enjoy a chicken balti pie when Nana is lying eight feet away in an open casket? The Newcastle fans chanted about City’s wasted Champions League chance, gleefully scratching away at that open wound. In truth, it probably didn’t help them. There was an interesting turn of phrase in Pep Guardiola’s programme notes where he briefly reflected on the Real Madrid defeat before adding: “But now we are back here with our people.” It was evidence of the fort mentality he has been trying to generate since he arrived in Manchester – with mixed success, it has to be said. You realised now why he had spoken so openly about his devastation in his Friday press conference, why he had insisted City could live with this defeat, but never forget it. All afternoon you could see him waving his arms on the touchline like a hype man, trying to stir the crowd into a scalded frenzy. But the Etihad Stadium crowd does not give its noise unconditionally. Partly this is because of the sizeable tourist contingent, a continuing problem at many big clubs. Mostly, though, it’s because crowds are at their best in the teeth of adversity and over the last few seasons you could probably count on your fingers the number of times this stadium has encountered genuine adversity. Instead, the default temperature of the Etihad Stadium drifts between three states: grumbling irritation, boisterous triumphalism and a kind of white noise – the noise of 600 completed passes at a 92% success rate, the noise of frictionless existence. In the early stages, it was grumbling irritation that was holding sway. Aymeric Laporte and João Cancelo missed big chances. So did Chris Wood for Newcastle. Raheem Sterling settled any residual nerves with a simple opening goal. But Newcastle were still able to work the ball up the field with consummate ease, still able to win too many second balls in midfield, very often just a good pass away from cutting City open entirely. Around half an hour in, though, something funny happened. Kevin De Bruyne looked up from his position in the left channel, made a brief set of calculations and played a gorgeous cross to Gabriel Jesus at the back post. Jesus couldn’t do anything with it, but De Bruyne’s sorcery instantly seemed to awaken something deep and elemental within the stadium. A reminder of what City are good at. A reminder of the power they still possess. Perhaps even a reminder of why they all do this. This, as much as anything he can physically do with a football, is De Bruyne’s talent. For all their individual excellence City possess vanishingly few players with the ability to turn the mood of a game, to get a crowd on its feet, to change the weather. Actually, that’s not quite true. Riyad Mahrez can do it. Phil Foden can do it. Jack Grealish at his best can certainly do it. The problem is that they so rarely get the latitude to do so: triple‑teamed by defenders, shackled to an intricate masterplan that essentially demands very fast ball retention. De Bruyne, you feel, is almost unique in this respect: the player who more than anyone seems to be the emotional centre of this team. When he’s buzzing, City are buzzing. When he disappears, even if they’re winning, something feels cold and disconsolate about them. It certainly does not feel coincidental that he failed to finish either of City’s last two Champions League exits: taken off after 72 flagging minutes in Madrid, knocked out by Antonio Rüdiger in the final against Chelsea last year. Each time City continued to compete, continued to generate chances. But something was missing: the thrill, the teeth, the implication that at any moment something might be conjured from nothing. Crisis over, then? It always felt faintly ludicrous, this debate over whether a team about to win their fourth title in five years have somehow failed or fallen short. Likewise the insistence of many City fans that they remain somehow cursed by bad luck, trodden underfoot, the victims of some establishment conspiracy. For all the chagrin of midweek, they’ve just beaten Newcastle 5-0, they get to watch De Bruyne play every week and they’re about to win the Premier League. They’ll be fine for now.",Sport/Football,City fans reminded of healing powers of De Bruyne and likely league title | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/08/manchester-city-healing-powers-kevin-de-bruyne-likely-league-title
5/9/2022,"BBC prison drama Time was the big winner at the 2022 television Baftas on Sunday, landing best miniseries and best actor for Sean Bean, in an in-person ceremony where social issues took centre stage. In another triumph for social realism, Help, about the care home crisis during the Covid-19 pandemic, won two awards. Jodie Comer won best actress for her role as a care worker, taking her second Bafta after winning for her role in Killing Eve in 2019, while best supporting actress went to Cathy Tyson for her portrayal of a resident. Speaking after she received her award, Comer said the show had enabled her to “realise the power we have in the stories we tell and that we choose to tell, and [the importance of] not shying away from difficult subject matters”. Collecting the award for Time as best miniseries, Stephen Graham praised “a phenomenal cast of young working-class men”, adding that they had made the show “an absolutely joy to be a part of”. Graham, who played a prison officer in the drama, said that as a child he had dreamed of working on “stories with a social commentary”. Tyson used her speech to thank Channel 4: “I remember being a teenager when Channel 4 was born and it had so many good things to do with it like diversity and it was a voice for people who were unheard at the time.” The other big winner was Big Zuu, who collected his two Baftas for best feature and entertainment performance for Big Zuu’s Big Eats with a look of incredulity. “This is mad, this is actually not normal,” he told a press conference. He made the case for representation in a powerful speech. “Mans come from humble beginnings. Representation is so important. Growing up, there weren’t many chefs or people that looked like me on telly. And now there’s young people watching us doing our ting thinking you know what? If these wastemen can win a Bafta, surely we can!” Sunday’s ceremony in the Royal Festival Hall in London’s South Bank marked the first in-person awards since 2019 as well as the television Baftas’ 75th anniversary. Crowds gathered on nearby Hungerford Bridge as stars of British television gathered on the red carpet. Setting the tone for the rest of the night, Bafta chair Krishnendu Majumdar opened the show with a political speech in which he made a powerful case for public service broadcasting in a direct challenge to the government’s plans to privatise Channel 4, as well as praising colleagues’ work in Ukraine and calling for more diversity among decision-makers in the industry. In the international category, Amazon Prime’s The Underground Railroad, an adaptation of Colston Whitehead’s Pulitzer-prize-winning novel about escaping slavery, beat off tough competition from hit shows Succession, Mare of Easttown, Squid Game and Call My Agent. In a winners’ press conference, actor Sheila Atim praised the counsellors on set for looking after cast members’ wellbeing. “It’s a real testament to the fact you can have really safe and protective work environment while still creating brilliant work.” In a further echo of this ceremony’s focus on topical social issues, Steve McQueen took home a Bafta in the factual category after missing out on an award for Small Axe last year, for his documentary Uprising, about the New Cross fire of 1981, which foreshadowed future racial injustices including Grenfell. McQueen told a press conference that for too long “black British history has been swept beneath the carpet”. He also made an impassioned plea for Channel 4 to help sustain UK creativity. “Other people have more money than us, the Americans, but we have great ideas and that’s what makes us who we are.” In another signal of the importance of inclusion on television, the reader-voted Virgin Media Must-see Moment went to Strictly Come Dancing for when contestant Rose Ayling-Ellis, who is deaf, danced with partner Giovanni Pernice in silence. She said was thrilled that her dance had led to “better deaf awareness”. “We’ve still got a long way to go but it’s such a great start,” she said. However, the 1980s-set Aids drama It’s a Sin, which had six nominations, the most of any show, failed to win any awards. The creators of lockdown drama Together, starring Sharon Horgan and James McAvoy, which won best drama, used their speech to read a statement from Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, who said they had been “ignored, lied to and gaslighted by a government seemingly too busy partying”, and called for a Covid inquiry to be launched. Matthew Macfadyen took home the award for best supporting actor for his role in Succession. Creator Jesse Armstrong accepted the award, telling a press conference that his chemistry with actor Nicholas Braun had been written in the script, but was chiefly due to the fact “the actors like working together and they feed off it and we feed off how they perform it and it’s a happy merry-go-round”. For scripted feature, Motherland took its first Bafta win for its final series. Gogglebox took home best reality and constructed factual, while best drama series went to teen angst series In My Skin. The best comedy performances went to Jamie Demetriou in the male category for Channel 4’s Stath Lets Flats, while Sophie Willan accepted her trophy in an expletive-laden speech for her role in BBC Two’s Alma’s Not Normal. Mo Gilligan, who took home the award for best comedy entertainment programme for The Lateish Show, said he owed his career to Channel 4 taking a chance on him. “I went to lots of meetings and they said: “You’re good but we don’t know what to do with you …” It’s really important we do save Channel 4 and use this platform to say it.”",Arts/Television & radio,TV Baftas 2022: Time wins best miniseries as social issues take spotlight,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/08/baftas-2022-time-wins-best-miniseries-as-social-issues-take-spotlight
5/9/2022,"Manchester City will be without Rúben Dias, Kyle Walker and John Stones as they seek to retain the title in the final three matches of the season. Pep Guardiola confirmed the defenders’ long‑term absences after the 5-0 rout of Newcastle on Sunday, with the City manager also claiming “people want Liverpool to win more than us” – the title rivals are now three points behind the champions with an inferior goal difference of four. While Stones and Walker were not in the matchday squad, Dias suffered a hamstring problem during the first half at the Etihad Stadium and had to be replaced at the break by Fernandinho. With Nathan Aké nursing an ankle injury that also makes him a serious doubt for the trip to Wolves on Wednesday, Guardiola may be without four frontline defenders for the trip to the Midlands. “Rúben, Kyle and John are out for the season,” Guardiola said. “In pre-season is the next time [we will see them]. We have 13.5 players because Nathan is not in perfect condition.” The 37-year-old Fernandinho will have a vital role in the championship run-in. “A lot [of importance],” Guardiola said. “Otherwise, it’s [the youngsters] CJ Egan-Riley or Luke Mbete[-Tabu]. In this situation it’s not a problem, Rodri can play there. We have the academy. Everyone has to do extra. We have problems and that’s all.” Of the chase between City and Liverpool, Guardiola said: “The people want Liverpool to win more than us – it’s not an issue. It’s normal. Maybe they have more supporters all around the world and in England maybe more support Liverpool than us. Liverpool, alongside [Manchester] United, are the most famous team, with what they have done in history – in terms of titles, legacy, history, dramas, for many, many things. But we are, for the last 10, 11, 12 years, coming there [too]. I know we are sometimes uncomfortable [for people who don’t want us to], but I don’t care.” Two goals from Raheem Sterling plus one each from Aymeric Laporte, Rodri and Phil Foden pulled City further clear of Liverpool following their 1-1 draw with Tottenham on Saturday. Each team has three games remaining. “What happened with Liverpool and today makes Wednesday an absolute final, final for us,” Guardiola said. “If we can win then maybe we come here on the final day against Aston Villa with our people looking to do back-to-back titles.” The win also represented the perfect response to the elimination from the Champions League semi-finals at the hands of Real Madrid last Wednesday. “It was a perfect afternoon,” Guardiola said. “With what this team has done, do you have any doubt?”",Sport/Football,"‘The people want Liverpool to win more than Manchester City,’ says Guardiola ",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/08/the-people-want-liverpool-to-win-more-than-us-says-guardiola-as-manchester-city-pull-ahead-in-the-title-race

5/9/2022,"Eleven months of Sundays have passed since a visibly uncomfortable Andrew Neil launched GB News, fighting sound and lighting issues at the new anti-woke network from which he soon resigned as lead presenter. Now, Neil has started another new Sunday show at Channel 4, where a professional studio set-up allowed us to see how much happier and healthier he looked than on that grim night last June. Although the type of viewer who would watch a political talk-show running opposite the Bafta awards would surely know who the presenter is, there were giant reminders as he sat between a sort of ego sandwich of the words The Andrew Neil Show in huge typeface both on the wall behind his desk and the facade in front. Many of us watching are likely to have been refugees from This Week, one of the most original and authoritative political series ever, which Neil presented on BBC One from 2003-19. There are echoes of that programme in the jokey opening – the host apparently caught unawares while eating curry and drinking champagne in his work place – and closing: Neil lifts up his script to reveal a copy of a hard-core tractor publication of the sort that apparently led the recently resigned Tory MP Neil Parish to be drawn into viewing porn. And, where This Week had Diane Abbott and Michael Portillo as Neil’s resident left-right sidekicks, he will be joined on Channel 4 each week by Pippa Crerar of the Mirror and Madeline Grant of the Telegraph. The network chose this start-date to follow last week’s local elections, but Neil and his team boldly ignored that event, with the presenter – who clearly seemed to have been given more editorial freedom than at the BBC – announcing that what really mattered was the cost of living crisis. This created an uncomfortable evening for the live studio interviewee, Jacob Rees-Mogg, minister for Brexit Opportunities and Government Efficiency, who was asked no questions at all on the first half of his brief and just one on the second, as Neil pressed him relentlessly on why the Johnson administration, in the inflation and prices crisis, seem to be doing least for those families who most need it. Rees-Mogg initially looked happy at the focus, always keen to play fantasy Chancellor of the Exchequer – but the true-blue politician looked increasingly true-red, seeming visibly angered by Neil’s combative approach: “The poorest need help now!” This was Neil back to his best, combining forensic knowledge of statistics and documents with intense listening during the interview, rather than, as some TV inquisitors do, sticking to a rigid pre-prepared question list. Caveats? Neil came close to Piers Morgan levels of narcissism when he scolded Rees-Mogg, “You don’t get away with cheap debating tricks! I grew up in a tougher debating school than you!” And he seemed so pumped up by the flaying of Jacob that he was too rude to Grant and Crerar in their segment at the end of the show. In future editions, he should treat these sharp journalists more as co-hosts. It also seemed strange that the weekend’s biggest political story – the convulsions in Northern Ireland caused by a Sinn Fein majority and a DUP ultimatum to London on post-Brexit border protocols – was touched on only in Neil’s outro. At some point in the run, a cheeky guest will ask Neil whether he thinks Channel 4 should be privatised – which could be interesting – but the network has done well in getting the premier political interviewer back at a first-class broadcaster.",Arts/Television & radio,"The Andrew Neil Show review – back to his best with curry, porn and Jacob Rees-Mogg",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/08/the-andrew-neil-show-review-back-to-his-best-with-curry-porn-and-jacob-rees-mogg
5/9/2022,"Dennis Waterman, who has died aged 74, was an actor whose rough-edged charm and gravelly tones were especially effective as criminals or crime-fighters who walked a tight line between danger and humour and could cross from one side to the other at unexpected moments. While some TV stars become indelibly associated with one famous role, Waterman achieved lead parts in three separate long-running prime-time features that rank among TV’s best-loved series. In The Sweeney (ITV, 1974-78), he was DS George Carter, a tough, sexist, corruptible detective, meeting violence with violence, in the Metropolitan police’s “flying squad”, junior to John Thaw’s DI Jack Regan. Almost as soon as that show came to an end, ITV cast him on (just) the other side of the law in Minder (ITV, 1979-89) as Terry McCann, an ex-con who, on release from jail, can find work only as a assistant-cum-bodyguard to George Cole’s Dickensian petty crook Arthur Daley. Those two roles secured Waterman’s place in TV history but his professional tenacity and rapport with audiences brought him another long-runner as Gerry Standing, one of a group of retired detectives brought back to run a cold case unit in New Tricks, which ran on BBC One from 2003-15. In the working-class south London culture from which Waterman grew up, there was often a sense that it was a matter of narrow luck whether some men became a cop or a robber, and Waterman shrewdly used this ambiguity to menacing effect in The Sweeney, comedy in Minder and somewhere between in New Tricks. Unlike actors who prefer clear top billing and the most lines in the script, Waterman was always best as a co-star, forming formidable double acts with Thaw and Cole, resulting in close friendships and deep mourning of their deaths. This loyalty and generosity also informed New Tricks, where he was part of a rotating star ensemble with Amanda Redman, Alun Armstrong, James Bolam, Denis Lawson and Nicholas Lyndhurst. Care is needed in reading an actor’s life into their performances, but it seems reasonable to feel that Waterman’s portrayals of chancers and hustlers may have drawn on an edginess he personally possessed. He had four marriages, of which the one to actor Rula Lenska ended due to Waterman’s admitted violent behaviour. Those incidents – and subsequent attempts to minimise his actions in an interview with Piers Morgan – would probably have ended a career now but the actor benefited from a greater willingness at that time to forgive so-called “bad boy” behaviour in prominent men. A viewer who only watched The Sweeney, Minder and New Tricks might raise questions over his acting range: DCI Standing could have been the older, slightly mellowed DS Carter and Terry McCann the nephew of either. But, in fact, across his career, Waterman was versatile. A natural performer, he was an actor for almost all of his life, making his film debut aged 11, playing an insulin-dependent child held hostage (can the police find him before he needs his medicine?) in the 1960 British movie Night Train to Inverness. Stage school and the Children’s Film Foundation brought him multiple roles in his youth, including the likable delinquent William Brown in a BBC production of Just William (1962). Also adept as a singer and dancer, Waterman appeared in West End musicals – including My Fair Lady and Windy City – and, unusually, specialised in singing the theme tunes of his TV shows, crooning over the credits of Minder, New Tricks and two lesser successes, On the Up and Stay Lucky. This signature gift was lampooned in sketches for the comedy series Little Britain, in which David Walliams played a caricature of Waterman infuriating his agent by turning down roles unless he was allowed to sing the title number. Showing an ability to laugh at himself by no means universal in showbiz, Waterman subsequently made a cameo appearance in a stage version of Little Britain, with Walliams and Matt Lucas. He will, though, most be remembered and replayed in a 1970s and 80s sub-genre of London streetwise drama created by Thames Television, and its greatest achievements The Sweeney and Minder.",Arts/Television & radio,Dennis Waterman: a streetwise natural in three great British TV series,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/08/dennis-waterman-a-streetwise-natural-in-three-great-british-tv-series
5/9/2022,"Senator Kirsten Gillibrand on Sunday called the battle over abortion rights in the US the “biggest fight of a generation”. The New York Democrat urged her party to stand up to Republicans seeking to abolish the constitutional right, and called the draft US supreme court opinion leaked last week, revealing a conservative-leaning super-majority supports overturning the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade decision, “bone-chilling”. She told CNN’s State of the Union Sunday politics talk show: “This is the biggest fight of a generation … and if America’s women and the men who love them do not fight right now, we will lose the basic right to make decisions, to have bodily autonomy and to decide what our futures look like.” Mississippi Republican governor Tate Reeves praised the draft ruling, which emerged last Monday evening and immediately sparked protests outside the supreme court in Washington DC, with more the next day and huge demonstrations planned across the US. His state has the pivotal case currently before the court that includes the option not just to severely restrict the procedure further but specifically to overturn the Roe v Wade opinion that made abortion a federal right, which was reaffirmed by the supreme court in 1992. “While this is a great victory for the pro-life movement, it is not the end. In fact, it’s just the beginning,” Reeves said of the draft opinion. Mississippi hopes to ban almost all abortion in a state that normally carries out around 3,500 such procedures a year. He talked of providing more education for women, to help them get better jobs to support children. Gillibrand called Reeves “paternalistic” and his and the court’s stance outrageous. “It’s taking away women’s right for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, our right to be a full citizen,” she said, adding that women are “half citizens under this ruling and if this is put into law, it changes the foundation of America”. Reeves said Mississippi plans to improve adoption processes and foster care systems and provide more resources for those expecting. However the state has a poor record on healthcare for low-wealth women, particularly women of color, in a nation frequently called out for high infant mortality rates and poor antenatal health. CNN show host Jake Tapper noted that Mississippi has the highest rate of child mortality in the United States, the highest rate of child poverty, no guaranteed paid maternity leave and that the legislature in Mississippi “just rejected extending postpartum Medicaid coverage”, referring to government health insurance for low-income populations. Tapper also pointed out that Mississippi’s foster care system is the subject of a long-running federal lawsuit over its failure to protect children from abuse. Reeves said: “I was elected not to try to hide our problems but to try to fix our problems.” Jake Tapper to Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves: You say you want to do more to support mothers and children, but you’ve been in state government since 2004... Based on the track record of the state of Mississippi, why should any of these girls or moms believe you?"" pic.twitter.com/VLuA6gcS1F Gillibrand said she was offended by Reeves’s remarks, adding: “I thought he was quite paternalistic towards women. He doesn’t look at women as full citizens.” Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, a fellow New York Democrat, said on Sunday that a piece of legislation that has been stalled in Congress would be put to the vote by the Senate again, on Wednesday. The Women’s Health Protection Act, which enshrines the rights afforded by Roe into federal legislation, rather than relying on court decisions, has passed the House of Representatives but was struck down in the senate in March, with one Democrat joining Republicans in opposing it. The final supreme court decision on Roe is due in June. Overturning Roe and instead letting each state set its own law on abortion would leave entire regions of the country without an abortion clinic within a day’s drive, reshaping the geography of abortion access in America in a single seismic shift. Minnesota Democratic senator Amy Klobuchar told ABC’s This Week host Martha Raddatz that there were Democrats in Congress and Democratic candidates who do not support abortion rights. But she said: “You have people who are personally pro-life but believe that that decision should be a woman’s personal choice, even if they might not agree with them. We have people in our party who vote to uphold Roe v Wade who might have different personal opinions, that’s a really important distinction.” “In the wake of the leaked draft, activists on both sides of the debate immediately began mobilizing for a drastic shift in America’s abortion laws.” @MarthaRaddatz sits down with the leaders of two advocacy groups: https://t.co/ECy1oebCRT pic.twitter.com/fU8IVPgdlf She accused the supreme court, which achieved a right-leaning controlling majority after Donald Trump nominated three justices – now having six conservatives and only three liberal-leaning judges on the nine-member bench, of wanting to take America back into ancient history. The draft opinion was written by conservative justice Samuel Alito. “The court is looking at reversing 50 years of women’s rights, and the fall will be swift. Over 20 states have laws [to ban] in place already. Who should make this decision, should it be a woman and her doctor, or a politician? Should it be [conservative Republican Senator] Ted Cruz…or a woman and her family? Justice Alito is literally not just taking us back to the 1950s, he’s taking us back to the 1850s,” Klobuchar said. Pro-abortion rights groups NARAL pro-choice America, Planned Parenthood and Emily’s List plan between the three of them to put more than $150m into campaigns to support abortion rights advocates as political candidates in elections this year. Mini Timmaraju, president of NARAL, told ABC: “As a movement, this has been probably the most devastating year since pre-1973.”",News/US news,Gillibrand calls abortion rights ‘fight of generation’ after ‘bone-chilling’ court draft opinion,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/08/kirsten-gillibrand-democrat-abortion-rights-fight-of-generation
5/9/2022,"Showcasing the talents of female drivers was the intent of the W Series, but at its opening two rounds in Miami this weekend it swiftly became all about the singular abilities of one woman in particular. Britain’s Jamie Chadwick won her second race in a row on Sunday at the Miami International Autodrome in an ominously strong start to the season by the double champion. The W Series was first held in 2019 with the aim of giving women a chance to compete where a lack of funding was curtailing, or in some cases stalling, their careers. The long‑term goal is to return a female driver to Formula One, which has not had a woman compete at a grand prix since Lella Lombardi raced in Austria in 1976. Chadwick won the opening season in dominant fashion. In the second season, held in 2021, she was pushed to the wire by Britain’s Alice Powell, one of the drivers whose career had been resurrected by W Series, but Chadwick came out on top after winning two races in Austin, Texas at the season finale. Her consistency has been absolutely authoritative and, with victory here, she has been on the podium in every race since the second round of last season. The 23-year-old from Bath had been hopeful of moving into the F1 feeder series, F3, this year, but admitted she did not have the right preparation nor the funding yet behind her to ensure a competitive drive. She has been unequivocal in saying she does not want to enter the series unless she can do it justice and has chosen to race in W Series again this year, while still targeting a move up to F3. This season she is racing in the team backed by the former Olympian Caitlyn Jenner and on Saturday, in an incident-packed race, she took the lead off the line, lost it in a tight battle with Finland’s Emma Kimiläinen but remained composed enough to take the win with a pass on the final lap. In race two on Sunday she started from pole and was on top throughout, leading to the flag to take victory a full three seconds up the road from Spain’s Nerea Martí, with Powell in third; a good comeback for the Briton who crashed out on the opening lap in Saturday’s race. For Chadwick this was another maximum-points haul after taking four wins in eight races last season, and she now has two already from the 10 to be contested this year. “I was confident heading into it but anything can happen, racing is so unpredictable,” she said. “It has gone better than expected, it’s not like we have been dominant with pace, so I am pleased we took the points but it is not going to be easy going into the rest of the year.” Chadwick has identified Powell and Kimiläinen, who was third last year, as likely challengers to her hegemony from the 18-driver grid. She already enjoys a resounding lead in the championship, 24 points clear of Martí in second and 29 in front of Beitske Visser in third. She was, however, taking nothing for granted despite the impressive start to the season. “It has exceeded expectations,” she said. “But it doesn’t mean a huge amount, there are still eight races left. I could DNF at the next two races. But it is important to start on the right foot and I am hoping that gives us confidence and momentum going forward for the rest of the season.” The W Series chief executive, Catherine Bond Muir, paid tribute to the series’ most successful driver but played down any suggestion that Chadwick’s dominance would detract from interest in the championship. “Jamie has shown her class all weekend,” Muir said. “But I don’t think she is necessarily the quickest. She is fantastically consistent, that is why she has been champion twice. “If she wins or not this year I don’t think it’s a bad reflection on W Series. I am not about to kick our champion out. I don’t believe Jamie is going to run away with the whole season.”",Sport/Sport,Jamie Chadwick eclipses W Series rivals with back-to-back victories,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/08/jamie-chadwick-eclipses-w-series-rivals-with-back-to-back-victories
5/9/2022,"Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has brought shame on Russia and the sacrifices its people made to defeat Nazi Germany in the second world war, leaders of the G7 group of leading western economies have said in a statement marking the 77th anniversary of the end of the global conflict. The statement, made on Sunday after a video conference between the G7 leaders and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was intended as a rallying call by liberal democracies in advance of Russia’s 9 May Victory Day parade in Moscow. The G7 statement said: “Through its invasion of and actions in Ukraine since 2014, Russia has violated the international rules-based order, particularly the UN charter, conceived after the second world war to spare successive generations from the scourge of war. “President Putin and his regime now chose to invade Ukraine in an unprovoked war of aggression against a sovereign country. His actions bring shame on Russia and the historic sacrifices of its people.” The leaders also accused him of “an attack on feeding the world” if he did not comply with international law and end the blockade on Ukrainian food exports. The G7 said it had collectively provided Ukraine with $24bn (£19.5) for financial and material support since the war started. Separately, in a televised address to the German people, Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, vowed Germany would not be paralysed by fear nor allow Russia to dictate the terms of any peace deal in Ukraine. In the joint statement the G7 leaders said they would collectively end their dependence on Russian energy “in a timely and orderly way”, but no precise timetable was set, reflecting the continued divisions in Europe about the speed with which such a phaseout can be achieved. In a clarification of war aims, the G7 statement said: “Ukraine’s ultimate aim is to ensure full withdrawal of Russia’s military forces and equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine and to secure its ability to protect itself in the future.” Downing Street said that in his contribution to the G7 discussion, Boris Johnson urged his counterparts to supply the Ukrainians with “military equipment that allowed them to not just hold ground in Ukraine, but recapture it”. Johnson “agreed with G7 leaders that the world must intensify economic pressure on Putin in any way possible, and said the west must not allow the war to turn into a stalemate that only magnified suffering”, a Downing Street spokesperson said. Johnson also urged his G7 partners to “intensify their diplomatic lobbying of counterparts failing to apply pressure on President Putin’s war machine”, No 10 said. Talks between diplomats in Brussels continued on Sunday to try to secure EU wide unanimity on a timetable for a phaseout of Russian energy, but the discussions were described as hard going. Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic have been offered permission to continue importing Russian oil until the end of 2024, but they also want help securing new sources of oil and retooling their refineries. Budapest wants a five-year period to wean itself off Russian oil and says it will need a new pipeline connection with Croatia, which has access to the sea. The diplomatic activity came as the US first lady, Jill Biden, made a detour from her trip to Slovakia and Romania to visit refugees on an unannounced visit to Ukraine, where she met her Ukrainian counterpart, Olena Zelenska. On a busy day for VIP visits in Ukraine, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, toured Irpin, a Kyiv suburb and scene of some of the worst early attacks by Russia. The president of the German Bundestag, Bärbel Bas, and the Croatian prime minister, Andrej Plenković, met Zelenskiy in Kyiv on Sunday. In the Kyiv metro, the Edge and Bono from U2, at the invitation of Zelenskiy, performed alongside a Ukrainian soldier. Bas is the most senior German politician to visit the capital. She took part in commemorative events on the anniversary of the end of the second world war, as well as discussing the vexed issue of German arms exports to Ukraine. It is expected that the German foreign minister, Annalea Baerbock, a surprise advocate of arms exports, will go to Ukraine shortly. Irpin’s mayor, Oleksandr Markushyn, posted pictures on an official social media channel with Trudeau, writing that the Canadian prime minister “came to Irpin to see with his own eyes all the horror that the Russian occupiers had done to our city”. Markushyn said Trudeau “saw – not military facilities – but burned and completely destroyed homes of Irpin residents, who until recently enjoyed life and had their own plans for the future”. On Monday Emmanuel Macron, the French president, will travel to Berlin for talks with Scholz and to make a major address.",News/World news,"Putin’s invasion of Ukraine brings shame on Russia, G7 leaders say",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/08/putins-actions-in-ukraine-bring-shame-on-russia-says-g7
5/9/2022,"A barrister specialising in lockdown rules has said a leaked document showing Keir Starmer attended a prearranged meal in Durham during an election could be used to clear the Labour leader of allegations that he broke the law. The document, published by the Mail on Sunday, shows that an 80-minute dinner with the Labour MP Mary Foy, featuring a takeaway curry, was planned as part of his schedule. The newspaper claimed that the document showed that the event was prearranged, “so no different from the No 10 events”. Conservatives argued the memo was evidence the meal was in breach of lockdown rules because it showed that it was prearranged to take place between 8.40pm and 10pm, and not just a spontaneous decision to order food. But Adam Wagner, a human rights barrister from Doughty Street Chambers, said he did not think the leaked memo showed that Starmer had broken any rules. “Seeing that this was a scheduled event as part of the leader of the opposition’s visit to Durham – during a local election campaign, an event focused on him being with a local MP and their staff, and it was in the evening and food was ordered because it was the evening – I don’t really see how it could be a breach of the regulations. “The regulations allowed for any gathering that was reasonably necessary for work or voluntary activity. And obviously the purpose of that visit overall was for the leader of the opposition to visit the local campaigners and the local MP and that is all on the schedule. “So the police would have to say, ‘Well we actually disagree with the Labour party’s analysis of what was reasonably necessary for the leader’s trip to Durham’ and I am doubtful that they could really go behind that reasoning,” he said. “The issue with the Downing Street events was that they were prearranged social events. “Those being investigated are the ones where it’s quite obvious that the purpose of the event was social – a Christmas party, a leaving party, a birthday party. “Whereas the fact that this [Starmer event] is preplanned, I think shows the opposite. It shows that the purpose was political.” He also argued that the event was analogous to the Downing Street gathering where Johnson and his staff were photographed drinking wine and eating cheese in the No 10 garden where they were said to be discussing work matters. That event was not investigated by the Met, Wagner pointed out. Wagner said the decision by Durham police to launch an investigation could lead to demands for Boris Johnson to release his schedule. “Are they going to look at the prime minister’s schedule and at every time he ate, during trips to various constituencies during last year’s local elections, and ask if that event was reasonably necessary?” he said. Durham police should also explain why the force is investigating Starmer two years after the event when it refused to investigate Dominic Cummings because of a policy not to take “retrospective action”, Wagner said. He added: “The first question for Durham police is: what is their policy and are they applying it consistently? “I think it would be unlawful if the reason they’re investigating is because they’re under lots of pressure from the newspapers and politically.” Another prominent lawyer said he believes the leaked memo puts Starmer in a difficult position. Matthew Scott, who publishes articles under the name BarristerBlogger, tweeted: “This is awkward for Starmer. Curry was planned in advance, at the end of the working day.”",News/Politics,"Leaked Beergate memo could clear Starmer, lawyer believes",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/08/leaked-beergate-memo-could-clear-starmer-lawyer-believes
5/9/2022,"On a beautiful Sunday in May a spot under the trees in an ancient woodland would seem like an idyllic location for a picnic for residents of the Devon town of Totnes. But when a group of 200 people settled down on the grass to enjoy sandwiches and slices of Victoria sponge next to the publicly funded woodland, they were actually breaking the law. This is because the Duke of Somerset owns much of the area’s woodlands, and they remain largely off limits to the public because they are used for a large pheasant shoot. The duke owns 1,100 hectares (2,800 acres) of land in some of the most beautiful areas of Devon, but the vast majority of it is inaccessible to the public. This is despite the fact he has received funds for the woodland the protesters picnicked in under the English woodland grant scheme, which comes from taxpayer money. The Guardian joined protesters on Sunday as they walked for a few hours in the sunshine and had a quiet, litter-free picnic in a field next to a conifer plantation. But by doing so, those assembled were falling foul of trespass laws. The group cheered as they passed a sign that said “no right of way”, which indicated they were officially trespassing on the duke’s land. This walk in the woods was illegal because there is no right to roam in England’s countryside. In Scotland, visitors have a right to visit green spaces, and it is agreed they should pass through respectfully and not leave a mess. Harry, a young Totnes resident and one of the organisers of the protest, told those assembled: “We’re here for a peaceful demonstration, ready to fight for a right to access the land. This not about a protest or a big march, this is about a peaceful walk in the woods where we should all have access when it’s so important to our health and wellbeing. We want to be careful, we want to be respectful and we will be litter-picking.” Those on the protest made a point of picking up litter in the woods, which are used chiefly for pheasant breeding and shooting. Plastic cartridges littered the floor, and in a valley visible from the field where the protesters picnicked, there was a “pheasant graveyard”, with at least 100 bird carcasses dumped alongside an old washing machine and a pile of wire fence. Sienna, 25, an environment worker from Totnes, said: “It just shows the excess, these people don’t even eat them. They shoot them for fun and disrespectfully dump them.” She moved to Totnes with her partner, Ross, 29, two years ago and the pair were here today on their first mass trespass. “There’s a lack of connectedness to nature,” Sienna said, adding: “More children know the names of Pokémon than they do wildlife species. We need to have access to the countryside so we can teach the next generation of environmentalists and have a wilder future.” Ross added: “I think people need to be able to get in amongst the environment to tackle climate change. If they can’t get in it, it will be a lot harder to show people what they need to protect. The duke of Somerset should open his land, at least when there isn’t a shoot going on, so people can experience nature.” The law of trespass stops people from walking around freely. Last year, the Treasury commissioned the Tory peer Theodore Agnew to lead a review into access to nature, asking respondents for “radical, joined-up thinking” to achieve a “quantum shift in how our society supports people to access and engage with the outdoors”. But, as the Guardian recently revealed, the review was quietly shelved and there are currently no plans to reveal the results to the public. Totnesians involved in today’s event asked for more of England’s countryside to be made publicly accessible. Currently, members of the public have a right to roam over just 8% of England; over the other 92%, the law of trespass still applies. Large swathes of private woodlands remain out of bounds to walkers, with estate owners using them instead for releasing and shooting pheasants, a non-native species of game bird. An estimated 50 million pheasants are released into the British countryside every year – equivalent in weight to the total biomass of wild birds in Britain. The Devon locals shouted: “Less room for pheasants! More room for peasants!” as they entered the forbidden territory, which was empty but for a couple of estate managers, who kept a suspicious eye on the protesters. Though they did not want to speak to the Guardian, the estate managers seemed amused by the peaceful group, who were chanting about pheasants as they strolled through the bluebell woods. Guy Shrubsole is an author and one of the leading voices in the right to roam campaign, who lives near Totnes. On the march, he said: “Regular access to nature is vital to people’s physical and mental health, yet so much of England’s countryside is shut off behind fences and intimidating signs. “Many woodlands – like those owned by the Duke – are off limits to the public because they’re brimming with pheasants put there for a few days’ shooting, with hugely detrimental impacts on the environment.” He said he had invited the duke to join the protesters, but he did not receive a reply. “We are a very non-confrontational event today. We reached out to him at his estate address and his House of Lords address. We wanted to say, if you go down to the woods today you might be a bit surprised by the numbers there. But you’re also very welcome to come and join us for a picnic and have a discussion about perhaps negotiating better access in the future.” The Duke of Somerset did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian. Frankie Gould, another local resident involved in the event, said: “Since our local group started trespassing last year we’ve visited many woods that are off limits to the public, shut away behind barbed wire fences and ‘keep out’ signs. “Yet the landowners of all the woods we’ve visited have benefited from publicly funded woodland grants. Public money, but no public access – how is that right? “The Forestry Commission and Woodland Trust give the public full access to their woods – why shouldn’t big private landowners do the same?”",News/UK news,‘Access is vital’: picnicking protesters target Duke of Somerset’s woods,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/08/picnic-protesters-duke-of-somerset-woods-right-to-roam-totnes
5/9/2022,"The actor Dennis Waterman – who starred in the TV shows Minder, The Sweeney and New Tricks – has died at the age of 74. Waterman, best known for his role as the bodyguard Terry McCann in ITV’s Minder, had a showbiz career that spanned 60 years. He first found fame playing the tough cop George Carter in The Sweeney and then starred as Gerry Standing, a retired police officer brought back as part of a cold case unit, in the BBC’s New Tricks. A statement from Waterman’s family said: “We are deeply saddened to announce that our beloved Dennis passed away very peacefully in hospital in Spain, on Sunday afternoon, with [his wife] Pam by his side. The family kindly ask that our privacy is respected at this very difficult time.” Waterman also had TV roles in ITV’s Where The Heart Is and the BBC’s The Canterbury Tales and Moses Jones. He was also known for singing the theme songs to many of his shows, and was caricatured by David Walliams in Little Britain. Walliams’s co-star Matt Lucas was among those to pay tribute. “I grew up watching Dennis Waterman’s iconic performances in The Sweeney and Minder,” he tweeted. “His guest appearance in our Little Britain Live show at Hammersmith Apollo – in which he hilariously duetted with David’s absurd impersonation of him – remains the absolute highlight of my career.” The actor and writer Reece Shearsmith said: “RIP Dennis Waterman. When I worked with him on New Tricks he made me the best cups of tea. And of course I just spent the time grilling him about Scars of Dracula.” Waterman starred in the 1970s Hammer horror film alongside Christopher Lee. The comedian Paddy McGuinness also paid tribute. He tweeted: “Myself and my Phoenix Nights cast mates used to sing the theme tune to Minder on tour and on the Karaoke! Gutted I never got to meet him, always wanted to be Terry McCann. Another icon from my childhood gone. RIP Dennis Waterman.” The DIY SOS presenter Nick Knowles reminisced about a charity golf trip he took alongside the actor: “I played golf on a tour to Bermuda with Dennis Waterman – I’m not much of a golfer – he was – but it was time spent with him between rounds that were well worth the trip. A genuinely lovely guy. RIP.” Born in London in 1948, Waterman was the youngest of nine children. He was educated at the Corona theatre school and began his showbiz career at a young age. He was invited to join the Royal Shakespeare Company at the age of 12 after a role for the Children’s Film Foundation. He married four times. He left his second wife, with whom he had two daughters, for the actor Rula Lenska. The couple divorced in 1998 and Waterman married Pam Flint in 2011. His daughter Hannah Waterman played Laura Beale in EastEnders and guest starred in New Tricks in 2007. Waterman faced criticism after he admitted hitting Lenska, but claimed she was not “a beaten wife”. In an interview with Piers Morgan he said he was “very, very ashamed” of the incident. He was also accused of trivialising domestic violence for telling Morgan’s Life Stories series: “I must have punched her one time because she did have a black eye.” He went on to add: “She certainly wasn’t a beaten wife, she was hit and that’s different.” Minder, which brought the criminal underworld of West London to millions of homes up and down the country, was revived by Channel 5 in 2009, but Waterman did not return. His last film role was in Never Too Late in 2020, filmed in Australia. His extensive career included numerous stints on the stage. He played Alfred Doolittle in a Royal National Theatre production of My Fair Lady, and starred in a touring production of Don’t Dress For Dinner. He also starred in productions of Twelfth Night, Edward Bond’s Saved at the Royal Court Theatre and Serjeant Musgrave’s Dance.
