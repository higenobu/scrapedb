12/10/2021,"Think of the world’s most stylish people and, until recently, the likes of David Beckham, Rihanna or Kate Moss might have been mooted. But in 2021, according to Google’s Year in Search report, they have been trumped by an unlikely name: Adam Sandler. The 55-year-old actor, known for the 90s comedies Happy Gilmore and The Waterboy as well as 2019’s Uncut Gems, beat Harry Styles, Lizzo, Melania Trump and Britney Spears to the top spot.  If these other names put serious effort into what they wear, Sandler’s style is significantly more relaxed. He combines long basketball shorts with XXXL T-shirts, boxy trainers, Ugg boots and wraparound shades. He has worn slippers and shorts to film premieres. The comedian and actor Pete Davidson named Sandler his favourite fashion icon in 2020, while Justin Bieber’s signature baggy shorts have been likened to Sandler’s. On TikTok, Sandler’s look is popular. More than 330,000 videos have used the “sandlercore” hashtag to discuss the actor’s look. It is precisely his lack of style direction that has enabled Sandler to become an unwitting fashion star. Input magazine even published an article headlined: “Adam Sandler hates fashion, which makes him a pandemic style icon”. Ashley Ogawa Clarke, the deputy editor of Mr Porter, says the Covid pandemic has been a crucial factor in the popularity of the actor’s look. “I had been working from home for just over a year, and I’d gotten used to being comfortable. When I saw Adam Sandler stuff on TikTok, it was refreshing,” he says. “People were getting excited because he goes against what you would consider well dressed.” Sandler’s new style status is part a wider trend for “slob-ebrities” that includes Jonah Hill, Larry David, Davidson and Bieber. If David’s oversized blazers and khakis made him an icon for the intentionally unremarkable normcore trend that emerged in 2014, Sandler takes things further. He is, as Ogawa Clarke puts it, “taking-the-bins out-core”. Coming to prominence in the late 90s and early noughties means Sandler also fits into Gen Z’s favourite Y2K trend. Tom Barker, a style writer at Highsnobiety, thinks this is key to his popularity now. “People would have first found his look by looking at early 2000s’ images,” he says. Barker believes there is an intentional irony from those in their 20s dressing in Sandler’s “embarrassing dad” outfits. But the actor’s couldn’t-care-less look is also genuinely fascinating to a generation who grew up in the glare of social media, where constructing a look is part of the culture. “He’s a multimillionaire how many times over, and he’s dressed like the least cool kid,” Barker says. “He is unashamedly himself in the way he dresses.” Ogawa Clarke says Sandler’s popularity demonstrates how menswear has changed: “It is not one thing any more. It can be a big mess sometimes. Sandler being voted best dressed is so unexpected. “And I think that is the word I would use for what good menswear looks like right now: it’s unexpected. What does a well-dressed man look like in 2021? That is the million-dollar question because it could be absolutely anything, and I love that. It’s like a terrifying kind of freedom.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,‘Slob-ebrity’ style: Adam Sandler is 2021’s most Googled fashion icon,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/dec/10/adam-sandler-named-2021s-most-googled-fashion-icon
12/10/2021,"Almost eight years after her son, Anthony Walgate, 23, became Stephen Port’s first victim, Sarah Sak is shocked, angry and vindicated after listening to the evidence laid out during the two-month hearing. Shocked, “because it wasn’t just one little mistake, or a couple of mistakes, it was all of them”. Angry, “because the police felt you can just keep saying sorry and that makes it right”. Vindicated, “knowing that we were right all along”.  “At one point, listening, I did actually cry. It was so sad. They [the police] just didn’t seem to care. “To them, he was just a student who took drugs, and that’s what students do,” she said. When police shut down their initial investigation into his death, despite her and his friends insisting the circumstances had to be suspicious, she felt totally dismissed. “It was so frustrating and upsetting.” “I went to my local MP. I went to my doctor and sat and cried for an hour. I was, like, nobody will listen. I didn’t know what to do, to be quite honest. I knew I was right”. It took Barking and Dagenham police 10 months to submit Port’s laptop for forensic examination after her son’s death, so they did not see the evidence of Port’s incessant obsession with drug-rape pornography involving young men, which would have raised significant questions from the start. “If they had done a check on Port instead of just Anthony, and looked into the police computer and seen what had been known before, and looked straight away at the laptop, the other three boys would have been saved,” she believes. She hopes now this will be “a turning point”, and that lessons have been learned. She believes the Met’s major investigation team should have taken over the investigations into the deaths at the beginning, and not have declined Barking police’s request for them to take the lead in her son’s inquiry. To her, the cases have exposed “massive failures” over how “disjointed” the police investigations were, meaning no one “joined the dots”. “The mindset needs to be changed, so they are not thinking that all young gay boys go to orgies, or that all students are drug takers. They need to treat everybody individually and stop this preconception they have of people,” she said. Since he died, she has felt Anthony’s presence very keenly in her quest for justice. “I cope by the fact that I know Anthony would be very proud. If it was him, he would have been there banging on people’s doors saying ‘no, this isn’t right’.”",News/UK news,‘The police didn’t seem to care’: mother of Stephen Port’s first victim speaks out,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/10/the-police-didnt-seem-to-care-mother-of-stephen-ports-first-victim-speaks-out
12/10/2021,"The inquests into the deaths of serial killer Stephen Port’s four victims have been told of a catalogue of failings, described as unique by the Metropolitan police deputy assistant commissioner, Stuart Cundy, which had “terrible consequences.” Coroner Sarah Munro QC said the jury had to consider if there were missed opportunities in each investigation to catch Port sooner and so prevent deaths.  Jurors found that police failings “probably” contributed to the deaths. Barking and Dagenham borough police “missed opportunities” in the first three investigations to catch Port sooner, the jury said in its conclusions. They also found there were omissions and failures in the involvement of the Metropolitan Police’s specialist crime and operations in the first three investigations which probably contributed to the subsequent deaths. A 23-year-old fashion student from Hull, Anthony Walgate had been dead for hours when found outside Port’s Barking flat, according to an ambulance responder and forensic medical adviser, immediately contradicting Port’s account that he had found him alive making “gurgling” noises. That should have raised significant questions. Neither a police national computer (PNC) record of a previous allegation of drug rape against Port by one man, nor a British Transport Police (BTP) report of him being questioned in the company of another drugged man at Barking station two weeks before Walgate’s death, were logged on the crime reporting information system (Cris), which updates officers on the ground – a “huge failure” and “terrible mistake”, one detective sergeant said. Neither of these men were questioned. Walgate’s underpants were inside out and back to front, his flies undone, and bruising under his arms indicated he had been moved. But his death was deemed unexplained rather than suspicious. When it emerged one week later that Port had hired Walgate as an escort using the pseudonym Joe Dean, Port changed his story, claiming Walgate had self-administered drugs and died in his flat. Port’s laptop was seized. He was charged with perverting the course of justice, pleaded guilty in March 2015 and was sentenced to eight months. By then he had killed Gabriel Kovari and Daniel Whitworth. But the crown prosecutor who advised that charge was not told about the previous PNC drug rape allegation, nor the BTP report, and did not know the contents of Port’s laptop because police had not yet examined it. The homicide assessment team (HAT), which advised Barking borough police on its investigation, instructed on 27 June 2014 that Port’s laptop be seized for examination. But Barking police did not submit it for forensic examination for a further 10 months, prior to Walgate’s first inquest. And they did not examine the downloaded results until July 2015 – more than a year after Walgate’s death. The trainee detective who eventually examined the downloaded material failed to register Port’s “absolutely incessant … all day, every day” obsessions with gay drug rape pornography, and the hundreds of thousands of messages in online forums and on social media about drug rape, especially of unconscious young men: an immediate red flag. Friends of Walgate continuously urged police to check Port’s laptop, telling officers Port was “dodgy as fuck”, but claimed they were told it was “too expensive” to check – a claim police strongly denied. The Met’s major investigations team refused requests from Barking borough police to take over the “complex” Walgate investigation – and those into the subsequent deaths – because they thought there was insufficient evidence of murder/manslaughter. Yet MIT officers were more experienced, and had access to the Holmes police database. Barking police were unhappy at the MIT decision. One Barking officer told colleagues it was “if and when” Port was arrested on suspicion of murder, and the borough CID commander said it was “more likely than not” to be a homicide case, telling superiors that “on the balance of probabilities” Walgate died “at the hands of another”. Though the two men had never met, police linked their deaths because Port placed a fake suicide note on Whitworth’s body claiming he had killed himself after accidentally killing Kovari with an overdose of date-rape drug GHB during sex. The note said: “BTW. Please do not blame the guy I was with last night. We only had sex then I left. He knows nothing of what I have done.” Police did not trace this “guy”, who was, in fact, Port. They did not submit the note, the bedsheet Whitworth’s body was wrapped in, or the drug bottle planted on him for forensic examination. Checks to verify Whitworth’s handwriting were limited to an officer emailing a scanned photograph of a small fragment of one sentence to Whitworth’s father, Adam. He told her he “wasn’t sure”, a claim she denied. No handwriting experts were consulted; instead officers later compared it with a diary. No phone data was obtained to show Whitworth was not in Barking when Kovari died. No tests were carried out on Kovari’s sunglasses, later shown to have Port’s DNA on them. Kovari’s social media accounts were not properly examined; nor was his former boyfriend, whom Port had befriended on Facebook using an alias, contacted and questioned. The family liaison officer in Kovari’s death never contacted his family in Slovakia, and referred to Kovari in one email as being from Lithuania. The investigating officer was not aware of the striking similarities with the previous three deaths, despite two detectives working with him having been involved in the Kovari and Whitworth deaths. A police constable, who was a member of the parks police patrolling on bicycles to prevent antisocial behaviour, was first at the scene. Despite his lack of any investigatory training, he was surprised to find himself tasked with following up leads. But it was he, rather than the CID, who discovered that Taylor had taken a taxi to Barking, and he who found CCTV footage at Barking station showing Taylor meeting an unidentified tall man – later identified by another officer as Port. And so the link was finally made.",News/UK news,Stephen Port case: the missed opportunities to catch a serial killer,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/10/stephen-port-case-the-missed-opportunities-to-catch-a-serial-killer
12/10/2021,"Nearly a year after three young boys vanished near their homes in Rio de Janeiro’s rundown northern sprawl, police have accused members of the city’s largest drug faction of murdering the children in reprisal for stealing an ornamental bird. The boys – aged nine, 11 and 12 – disappeared on the afternoon of 27 December 2020 after leaving their homes in the Morro do Castelar favela to play. They were last seen in eerie security footage showing them walking towards a local street market.  What became of those children – Lucas, Alexandre and Fernando – has remained a mystery despite a nationwide outcry and a major police investigation. On Thursday, however, investigators claimed they had finally cracked the case, having discovered that the boys had been abducted by members of the Red Command (CV) faction that controlled their community. Homicide chief Uriel Alcântara said the children had been tortured and subjected to a vicious punishment beating, in which one of them had died, for allegedly stealing a bird belonging to the uncle of a local gangster. “They beat up the children, went over the top and ended up killing one of them – and so they decide the solution is to execute the other two,” Alcântara alleged. The murders have exposed the senseless violence that plagues Rio’s low-income favelas, over which authorities have largely relinquished control to the increasingly well-armed gunmen employed by drug factions or paramilitary gangs. Police claim one local trafficker, Ana Paula da Rosa Costa or “Auntie Paula”, had arranged for the children’s corpses to be smuggled out of the favela, dismembered and thrown in a river. The bodies have yet to be found. During the investigation, one witness reportedly claimed he had heard one of Castelar’s drug bosses, Wille Castro da Silva, admit: “We got the kids and we killed them.” Silva, a 35-year-old gangster known by the alias “Stala”, was one of five murder suspects police had arrest warrants for when they raided the favela before dawn on Thursday. But at least three of those five are already thought to be dead, having been executed on the orders of senior CV leaders for their role in murders that violated the group’s strict internal code and drew unwanted attention to its criminal operations. Auntie Paula, 44, who sold synthetic drugs such as ecstasy in the favela, was reportedly tortured and killed in early October after being summoned to the CV’s headquarters in the Complexo da Penha favela network. Days later another trafficker and murder suspect, known by the nickname “Piranha”, was also reportedly sentenced to death by CV chiefs for failing to prevent the killings. Stala, who allegedly oversaw the beating and torture of the children after his uncle’s bird was taken, is also believed to have been killed. Flávia Oliveira, a prominent political and social commentator, told the GloboNews TV network that the killings, and their brutal aftermath, revealed “a society that has succumbed to barbarism”. “This is a society that has trivialised death and has trivialised the lives of its children,” Oliveira said, urging Rio’s governor, Brazil’s president and all Brazilians to apologize to the victims’ families. “These three boys … also died as a result of exclusion, a lack of assistance, indifference, and because of the initial delay in investigating. They died because of misery, poverty and the lack of security,” she said. The leftist politician and human rights activist Marcelo Freixo called for the perpetrators to be punished and for the killing to end. “Rio cannot continue to be held hostage to the violence of crime.” Yet there is little sign of the city’s decades-long drug conflict coming to an end. A police “pacification” project designed to regain control of the favelas before Brazil’s 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics has largely disintegrated. At least 4,386 gunfights have been reported in Rio this year alone, according to the violence monitoring group Fogo Cruzado. More than 1,000 people have died. In a wretched demonstration of the seemingly unbreakable cycle of violence, it was reported in October that the father of one of the missing boys had been arrested with a gun after signing up to a local gang in the hope of tracking down his son’s killers. “He said he had joined the faction so he could find the murderer and avenge the death of his son,” police chief José Mário Salomão told reporters at the time.",News/World news,"Missing Rio boys tortured and killed for stealing bird, say police",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/10/rio-gangsters-tortured-and-murdered-missing-boys-say-police
12/10/2021,"The International Energy Agency is facing calls to make the national energy data it collects from governments publicly available. This would aid independent research, which in turn could help to accelerate the global transition to low-carbon energy.  More than 30 international academics have written to the global energy watchdog to call for it to drop its paywalls for national energy datasets, which are collected using public funds, to avoid making climate action “more costly and less effective”. The IEA publishes a number of influential reports on global energy systems, based in large part on the national energy data provided by the governments that it counts among its members. However, much of the data that underpins these reports is inaccessible to independent researchers. The academics said that putting datasets behind paywalls makes it more difficult for independent energy system analysts, and the interested public, to investigate and better understand the path to net zero. Instead, the “high-quality data” required to create effective and low-cost pathways to net zero societies should be available under suitable open licences, according to the academics. “High-quality datasets already exist: they are published by the IEA but remain behind paywalls. And despite the IEA being a publicly funded institution, researchers and other interested third parties have to normally pay and consent to non‐disclosure to access the IEA data,” said the open letter to the IEA’s executive director, Fatih Birol. “Ultimately, a lack of data availability will lead to net zero transition pathways that are both more costly and less effective than they should have been,” the letter added. The IEA was set up following the 1970s oil crisis to monitor global energy markets and provide independent global assessments that can be used to inform the decisions of policymakers and financiers. It is funded by member countries and other organisations but also generates revenue by selling data via paywalls. A spokesperson for the IEA said the agency was “committed to enhancing and expanding data access” and has in recent years set a new policy to make more and more data and analysis available without charge. “However, our data sales form an essential part of our operational budget, allowing the IEA to deliver on its essential mandates. The bulk of these sales are to private energy companies, financial institutions and consultancies,” the spokesperson said. The academics argue that the IEA could bring in a small increase in its membership fees to cover the lost revenue from selling its data to the private sector. The modest rise in costs for members would be more than offset by the lower cost of energy solutions that would be possible if the data were more freely available, the academics said.",News/Environment,Academics urge IEA to give free access to national energy data,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/10/academics-urge-iea-to-give-free-access-to-national-energy-data
12/10/2021,"The soul singer Beverley Knight has lambasted raucous theatregoers who she said disrupted a performance of the West End musical she is starring in. In a tweet posted on Thursday evening after the show, The Drifters Girl, Knight said: “Ok. If your intention is to come to the theatre, get rat-arsed, make a scene, disrupt the show thus causing a show-stop?  “My advice is stay your ass at home. People pay to come to the theatre to be entertained, not to endure your foolishness. Done.” She added that she had been “fuming”, and that it was the second night in a row that audience members had caused disruption. Responding to Knight’s post, a member of Thursday’s audience tweeted that “people were drinking throughout, so by the second half they were joining in with the singing & drowning the cast out. There was a lot of lurching in the interval. Perhaps limit the amount of drinks sold & not allow people to bring bottles in from outside?” Another person tweeted: “I went to the show and wasn’t too far from the person that disrupted the show which she should be ashamed of. I didn’t think the audience drowned out the cast at all some people sang along and was just enjoying the brilliant show.” A spokesperson for production said: “Last night at the Garrick theatre, two audience members had to be escorted out of the building by theatre staff for loud and abusive behaviour during the performance of The Drifters Girl. The cast left the stage whilst this happened, before resuming and completing the performance. “This is an isolated incident, however both The Drifters Girl and Nimax Theatres would ask all patrons to behave in a responsible, respectful manner when attending a performance.” The Drifters Girl, at the Garrick theatre in London’s West End, is about the female manager of the all-male vocal group, The Drifters. Knight plays Faye Treadwell, who was one of the first prominent African American women in music management. The Guardian’s review said of the show: “The music in the show is a triumph – how could it not be with Beverley Knight’s almighty voice? …. Knight blows us away with each number and there is a particularly inventive rendition of Ben E King’s Stand By Me. Her character squares up to a sexist industry that puts her down and pats her bottom.” Knight, often described as the queen of British soul, was awarded an MBE in 2006 in recognition of her contribution to British music. Her hit singles include Shoulda Woulda Coulda and Come As You Are. On the long thread below her Twitter post, one person said there had been: “Lots of drunk folk getting up and down during the show when we came last week.” Another contributor who had seen the show recently said: “Ours and others enjoyment was impacted by the selfishness of 2 audience members who spoke at volume and argued with people when asked to quieten down.” In response to suggestions that theatres stop selling alcohol, Knight said: “Thing is they rely on the revenue that the bar receives. It’s tricky. Most folk who come along are not utter idiots.” Complaints about audience behaviour are not uncommon, with mobile phones, coughing, chatting and eating among the offences. In 2018, the actor Mark Rylance said disruptive audiences were the fault of actors not “telling the story well enough”. “Surely they [audiences] should be allowed to do what they want – if they’re making noise then you’re not holding them. You’re not telling the story well enough.

12/10/2021,"Each year, McDonald’s buys as much as 1.9bn lb of beef that it packs into patties for millions of Happy Meals, Quarter Pounders, Big Macs, Triple Cheeseburgers and other popular beefy sandwiches served across the globe. The staggering volume of meat requires the company and its suppliers to slaughter north of 7 million cattle, according to some estimations, and that comes at a steep cost to the environment: McDonald’s more than 53m metric tons of greenhouse gas produced in 2020 exceeds several European nations’ emissions.  In recent years, the company announced big sustainability initiatives but climate experts who reviewed McDonald’s plans and data say the burger company is largely dodging the one bold step it must take to slash emissions: dramatically reducing the amount of beef it serves. “The naked truth is McDonald’s is in a business that is fundamentally at odds with the Earth’s integrity,” said Gidon Eshel, an environmental and urban studies research professor at Bard College. “No fig leaf, however persuasive or covering it is, can change that fact.” McDonald’s announced its most recent plan in October amid mounting pressure on companies to act. Investment funds managing more than $29tn in assets in late September called on the world’s 1,600 largest polluters to cut emissions in line with climate science. And a recent major study found the world’s food system accounts for about one-third of greenhouse gas emissions, with the beef industry comprising as much as 25% of that figure. Beef is particularly problematic because cows release high levels of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, in their burps and manure. The amount of feed, water and land that cows require to produce a pound of meat is much higher than other animals and that inflates their carbon footprint. Raising cows exacts a “multidimensional burden” on the Earth, Eshel said, because it also pollutes, consumes water and spurs deforestation. McDonald’s announcements suggest it’s already well on its way to reducing emissions. Its 2018 sustainability plan pledged by 2030 to reduce total emissions from its restaurants and offices by 36% and to reduce “emissions intensity” across its supply chain by 31% compared with 2015 levels. In October the company announced a commitment to “net zero” emissions by 2050 and included an optimistic progress report on the 2018 emission reductions goals. But climate scientists have called into question the math behind McDonald’s 2018 plans, and a closer look at its 2021 progress report finds that little headway has been made. The new “net zero” plan has also drawn criticism from environmental groups over its lack of specifics and long timeline. More important are the plans’ absence of menu changes needed to significantly reduce beef production and emissions, said Jennifer Molidor, ​a senior food campaigner with the Center For Biological Diversity. “When it comes to the most meaningful solution for the climate crisis – serving far less beef and shifting toward low-carbon options right now – we don’t see the action on menus that we need from this megacorporation,” she said. “Not moving boldly on their menus suggests motivations might not be to mitigate climate change but to manage investors.” In a statement, a McDonald’s spokesperson didn’t address specific questions about emissions or its plans, but said the company has been “pursuing ambitious actions to help address climate change in areas where we have the biggest opportunities for impact”, including reducing packaging waste and improving livestock management. It labeled criticisms of its plans “opinion-based”. Molidor said you have to be a “climate nerd” to understand the story that McDonald’s complex numbers and insider terminology really tells, and that alone is a red flag. “One of the main signs that something is ‘greenwashing’ is that it’s not clear or transparent,” she added. McDonald’s October press release boasts an “8.5% reduction in the absolute emissions of our restaurants and offices from the 2015 baseline”. But restaurants and offices account for a very small portion of McDonald’s emissions, which means the 8.5% slice is much smaller than marketing makes it appear. The drop mostly comes from McDonald’s switching to more energy efficient lightbulbs at its nearly 40,000 restaurants, said Dexter Galvin, global director of corporations and supply chains for CDP. The environmental transparency non-profit works with McDonald’s and other big corporations to implement and assess progress on companies’ climate plans. Galvin called it a good first step but said it’s not “a material reduction”. That will need to come from changes to the company’s beef operation, he added, and the press release highlights McDonald’s progress on that front: “A 5.9% decrease in supply chain emissions intensity from the 2015 baseline.” However, emissions are still increasing, just slightly slower than they once were. “Emissions intensity” describes the amount of emissions per unit of product. If the company grows, as McDonald’s has, then its emissions can also increase. Emissions from the company’s beef production and supply chain jumped by about 40% from 2017 to 2020, according to data disclosed to CDP. Galvin said McDonald’s is “building the systems and processes” it needs to reduce the greenhouse gas emitted by its beef operation and supply chains, but added, “they need to really start showing significant reductions, and I think there will be a point where they need to diversify what’s being offered on their menus”. McDonald’s “net zero” by 2050 pledge has also been criticized because such plans can allow polluters to continue emitting high levels of greenhouse gases over the next decades. To offset emissions that companies continue to produce, “net zero” programs often rely on carbon offset schemes – which have been the subject of multiple investigations pointing to flawed carbon calculations and uncertain impacts – as well as carbon capture technology, which is expensive and not yet operating at scale. Though McDonald’s plans and metrics are complex and controversial, they hold high marketing value because they give the appearance to the layperson of real progress, Molidor said. “McDonald’s is taking advantage of people who don’t understand this kind of math,” she added. Last year, Burger King rolled out beef made from cows that it says burp and fart less due to the addition of lemongrass to their diets, while researchers in Germany developed a “potty training” strategy for cows that they say will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While some argue that consumption reduction is the only meaningful approach, the beef industry’s contribution to the climate crisis demands “a whole food system approach”, said Mario Herrero, a Cornell University sustainable food systems professor. That includes imaginative solutions to improving animal care, reducing waste, fine tuning management practices and more, but he said that McDonald’s low prices and accessibility drive its popularity and emissions. One important aspect is for the public to understand better the health, environmental and economic toll of beef production and for beef to be consumed and priced accordingly, he said. “If McDonald’s or any producer is serious about tackling the issue, it will provide a message of moderating consumption and include the true costs of beef,” Herrero said. Governments could tax beef, impose regulations or slash massive industry subsidies that maintain low prices – a 2015 analysis found a US Big Mac’s cost would jump from $5 to $13 if $38bn in meat subsidies were eliminated. However, Donald Trump and the right have already made beef consumption a culture war flashpoint, and any such moves would be “a touchy political issue”, Herrero acknowledged. Absent the political will, it’s up to corporations to lead, and McDonald’s has been years behind competitors like White Castle, Burger King and more in fully introducing plant-based burger options. McDonald’s only began to test its McPlant in a small number of European countries and five American stores this year, though it tested a plant-based burger in Canada in 2019 before scrapping the trial. Galvin said McDonald’s spends $40bn on procurements annually, and it must use that as leverage to quickly convince its suppliers to use more sustainable practices. “They need to use that influence in their supply chain to massively reduce emissions and they are quickly running out of time,” he said. McDonald’s said in a statement that it’s a small part of the world’s food system and added “beef and animal protein consumption are a part of people’s lives and livelihoods all over the world and will continue to be for decades to come”. Though McDonald’s has said it offers what consumers want, Molidor said the company doesn’t meet demand – it drives it. In choosing to wield its $650m annual marketing budget largely to sell low cost, beef products on its menus, it directly increases consumption, she said. “People don’t eat what’s not on the menu,” Molidor added. “Companies could make it cool to eat a smaller burger, a salad without chicken, more wraps, they could redefine what American fast food looks like. Instead, they’re making a triple cheeseburger.” While McDonald’s plays an outsize role in “perpetuating the culture of beef in the US”, said Eshel, consumers ultimately have to weigh the consequences before their next Big Mac. “The culture of beef is not consistent with Earth’s wellbeing, and we have to choose: do you eat beef and let Earth incinerate, or do you forgo beef and give Earth a fighting chance?”",News/Environment, Hold the beef: McDonald’s avoids the bold step it must take to cut emissions,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/10/mcdonalds-emissions-beef-burgers
12/10/2021,"I’ve been trying to work out why, having never been a suit wearer, they are suddenly all I want to wear. Over the years, I have dressed for the office in trousers and shirts, or dresses and blazers, or skirts and sweaters – pretty much any combination of clothes. Except that I’ve never worn a matching jacket and trousers, or matching jacket and skirt. I would no more have worn a suit to the office than I would have put on a hard hat, or chef’s whites, or scrubs. A suit felt like a school uniform: if you have to wear it, you wear it, but if it’s not mandated, it’s not a getup you adopt for fun. That would be odd. My mum bought me a skirt suit – plum colour, nubbly wool, from Hobbs – for my university interviews. I still remember how I felt wearing it, waiting nervously in stuffy corridors, conscientiously play-acting calm and competent adulthood.  Until 2021, I had never bought a suit. Going back to the office this year has felt a little bit like conscientiously play-acting competent adulthood again. After I’d spent months quietly pouring words into a laptop at home, the theatre of office life, with its swipecards, strip lights, printer noises and hydraulic chairs that wheeze up and down, feels like a lo-fi, slow-motion fairground. In the form of actual human beings, colleagues expect more interaction and constructive feedback than the dog, who is thrilled with a pat on the head and the odd snack. The shenanigans of getting a canteen coffee is cacophonous compared with the slippered shuffle to the kettle. A suit is the ultimate going-to-work cosplay, and that feels like just what I need, so I’ve started wearing a trouser suit. Strictly, it’s not a suit, just a pair of flecked wool tailored trousers from Jigsaw that I realised were almost the exact same shade of grey as an unstructured Cos blazer in my wardrobe. Putting the two together was a baby-steps approach to suit wearing, like letting the air out of swimming armbands little by little. Suits are back in vogue, just when you might think they’d be falling out of favour – which makes no sense, except that it is exactly how fashion works. Marks & Spencer has announced it is axing men’s suits from half of its larger stores, in response to the casualisation of our wardrobes. Meanwhile, I am seeing more suits at fashion shows – on both men and women, on the catwalk, and on the front row – than ever before. There were trouser suits all over the London catwalks; Paris was packed with peppy miniskirt suits. The very fact of the suit becoming optional, of no longer being rigidly synonymous with a certain kind of office discipline, is giving it a new lease of life. So, the big news is that I’ve discovered a suit is a brilliant formula for smart daywear. Who knew? Ah yes, good point – probably the tens of millions of people who have been wearing suits to work for decades. But not me. I don’t tend to wear my suit-that-isn’t-a-suit with a traditional shirt, because I quickly feel crumpled, but I’m a scruff. The suit is brilliant with buttoned-up polo shirts, with a ribbed cardigan tucked in, or – now that it’s cooler – with a chunky funnel-neck knit. My next stop is a skirt suit. I have in mind a skirt that’s not too short, with an oversized jacket, probably double-breasted. I’m thinking tights, and probably loafers. I don’t think I’ve ever lusted over a more conventional look in my life. And I don’t think I’ve ever felt more of a maverick.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Wearing a suit to work now seems odd – which is why it’s so radical  | Jess Cartner-Morley,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/dec/10/wearing-a-suit-to-work-now-seems-odd-why-its-so-radical

12/10/2021,"A season characterised by controversy, off-track politics and the appalling Nürburgring crash that nearly killed Niki Lauda would end in bizarre circumstances. Having bravely returned, heavily bandaged, to racing six weeks after his accident, Lauda of Ferrari led the drivers’ championship by three points from James Hunt before the final race, at Fuji Speedway. Torrential rain made the circuit particularly treacherous and Lauda retired after two laps, reportedly saying: “My life is worth more than a title.” Hunt finished third in his McLaren to become champion by one point.  The era of Ayrton Senna, Alain Prost and Nigel Mansell was one of Formula One’s most memorable. It was not the great Senna but another Brazilian, Nelson Piquet, in contention in 1986 before the final grand prix in Adelaide, along with his Williams-Honda teammate Mansell and Prost of McLaren. Mansell needed to finish third to ensure overall victory but after starting on pole a spectacular rear tyre blowout ended his race, with Murray Walker in disbelief alongside Hunt on commentary. Prost took the title by two points. A 1989 crash at Suzuka between the Brazilian and the Frenchman, teammates at McLaren, ultimately led to Prost taking the title after Senna’s eventual disqualification. Tension was at an all-time high before the penultimate race the following season, with Senna on pole but on the right-hand, dirty side of the track. Prost, having moved teams to Ferrari, edged ahead into the first corner. Senna kept his foot down and the predictable collision allowed him to win his second drivers’ title by seven points. Michael Schumacher for Ferrari led Jacques Villeneuve in the Williams by a point before the final grand prix in Jerez. Ferrari had been waiting 18 years for a drivers’ title, since Jody Scheckter’s success in 1979. When Villeneuve attempted to pass Schumacher on the inside the German turned in on his rival, apparently aiming to take both cars out and settle the drivers’ championship on the spot. Schumacher succeeded only in ending his own race, with Villeneuve steering his damaged car home in third to take the title. Schumacher, who three years earlier had crashed into Damon Hill in Australia and thereby won the title for Benetton, was subsequently disqualified from the championship and faced widespread condemnation. Hamilton’s first title arrived through one of the most dramatic denouements in Formula One. Then 23, the Briton approached the Interlagos season finale knowing fifth in his McLaren would be enough for the drivers’ crown, even if Felipe Massa, on pole, triumphed in his home race for Ferrari. Hamilton seemed on course until the late arrival of rain, at which point all the leaders bar Timo Glock changed tyres. A slip by Hamilton enabled Sebastian Vettel to move him down to sixth and Massa delivered victory, sparking celebrations among team members, friends and family, who believed he had taken the title with the chequered flag. But the rain grew heavier and Glock began losing pace on his dry tyres, enabling Hamilton to pass the Toyota in the closing corners and sensationally clinch the title by a point. Two years later Vettel set a new mark for youngest champion by five months, with Hamilton, Fernando Alonso and Mark Webber remarkably also having a shot at the title going into the final race at Yas Marina. There had been eight changes of leader in the drivers’ championship that season – but the final day would be the first time Vettel, then aged 23 and four months, topped the standings. A flawless drive saw him lead from pole to flag, sparking a run of four straight drivers’ titles for Red Bull.",Sport/Sport,"Six great F1 title deciders, from Hunt v Lauda to Senna v Prost",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/10/six-great-f1-title-deciders
12/10/2021,"With 1bn doses of Covid vaccines expected to arrive in Africa in the coming months, concern has shifted to a global shortage of equipment required to deliver them, such as syringes, as well as insufficient planning in some countries that could create bottlenecks in the rollout. After a troubled start to vaccination programmes on the continent, health officials are examining ways to encourage take-up as some countries have had to throw away doses.  Critics have blamed hoarding of vaccine doses by a handful of western countries for a situation in which only 7.5% of people in African countries have been vaccinated – which some argue led to the emergence of the Omicron variant in southern Africa – but health experts point to a wider series of issues. The World Health Organization says a shortage of syringes – in particular a 0.3ml syringe version required to deliver the Pfizer dose – may slow delivery, and it has stepped up technical assistance missions in 15 countries that have lagged behind. Figures show a wide disparity in what has been achieved, with 15 countries reaching a target of 10% of the population vaccinated by the end of September, and more than half struggling to reach a third of that number. Among the success stories have been some smaller island states, including Seychelles and Mauritius, which have vaccinated over 60% of their populations, and Morocco has reached 48%. The case of South Africa – which had vaccinated 40% of its population as of 3 December – highlights some of the complexities involved. With sufficient doses for an estimated 150 days of vaccination, it has cancelled some vaccine shipments as it has tried to reinvigorate a campaign that had met resistance from some sections of the population, not least in the 18-34 age group. Some of South Africa’s vaccine supply problems were self-inflicted, including being slow to initially secure stock. There have also been technological issues, with requirements to register using a phone or computer creating a digital barrier in a country where only 60% of people are internet users. Dr Richard Mihigo, a WHO programme coordinator, said there had been a “start and stop” approach to vaccine drives in Africa in recent months. “The first doses arrived in Ghana in March and there were a lot of promises from Covax [the global vaccine consortium] that countries would receive their allocations. But that delivery was stopped when India halted delivery from the Serum Institute [in the midst of its own outbreak] earlier this year,” he said. “That start was not ideal. Since then, however, the situation has stabilised. Now the prospects through March 2022 looks very good with almost one billion doses forecast to arrive, which in theory could cover 70% of the African population.” Set against that, however, has been the struggle of some countries to deliver what doses they have – because of instability, for example in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria; health systems with poor reach, especially outside big cities; and vaccine hesitancy around the Covid jab. Nigeria’s underfunded health system lacks everyday supplies such as cotton swabs. Spotty power supply means fridges holding vaccines need to be kept on expensive fuel generators, and millions of citizens live in areas racked by banditry or Islamist insurgencies that medics cannot reach. Nigeria’s health minister, Osagie Ehanire, said last week: “The foundation is not strong. And if you don’t have a strong foundation, there’s not much you can build on top.” Hesitancy has been driven by a combination of factors on a continent that in general, studies suggest, has far higher rates of vaccine acceptance than the US. The huge amount of misinformation that has circulated globally is partly to blame, but there are also economic reasons. David Harrison, the head of the nonprofit DG Murray Trust in South Africa, said some were reluctant to give up a day’s work or pay to travel to a vaccination site. “Twelve million people applied for an R350 (£16) emergency Covid-19 relief grant,” he said. “If you’re asking those people to pay R20 for a taxi fare to and from a vaccine site, it’s a significant trade-off.” Mihigo, of the WHO, echoed this point. “To make sure more and more of the available vaccine can be put in arms of the people, we need to focus attention on providing additional incentives to people to get vaccinated without compromising their livelihoods. “I was in DRC recently and I heard someone say precisely this. They can’t afford to travel and then wait in a vaccination centre for two hours.” Writing in South Africa’s Mail and Guardian this week, Anand Madhvani, a co-founder of Covid Kenya – a group of volunteers that uses social media to create awareness about Covid-19 issues – raised local inequalities in vaccine access. “In many African countries we have some existing systems for vaccinations, but these require massive expansion and support for mass adult campaigns – even once a steady supply of vaccines is available,” he wrote. “In Kenya, where I work, we needed high-profile local language vaccination campaigns. There is deep inequality within our countries. Relative elites in capitals quickly got themselves vaccinated but stopped pushing for everyone.”",News/Global development,African countries aim to step up Covid vaccine delivery with 1bn doses due,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/dec/10/african-countries-aim-to-step-up-covid-vaccine-delivery-with-1bn-doses-due
12/10/2021,"Taylor Swift will face a jury trial over accusations that she plagiarised lyrics for her 2014 hit Shake It Off from another song. A US judge refused Swift’s request for the case to be dismissed on the grounds that a jury could find that the song copied Playas Gon’ Play, a song released by girl group 3LW in 2001. Both songs feature variations on the lines “players gonna play” and “haters gonna hate”.  The Guardian has contacted representatives for the pop star for comment. District judge Michael W Fitzgerald had originally dismissed the lawsuit in 2018, saying that the lyrics were too “banal” to be copyrighted, citing 13 songs – by the likes of Fleetwood Mac and the Notorious BIG – that featured similar phrasing. But Playas Gon’ Play songwriters Sean Hall and Nathan Butler appealed the ruling, seeking a jury trial and unspecified damages, and a federal court reversed the decision in October 2019. In response, a representative for Swift said: “These men are not the originators, or creators, of the common phrases ‘players’ or ‘haters’ or combinations of them. They did not invent these common phrases nor are they the first to use them in a song.” They expressed their confidence that the “true writers of Shake It Off” – namely Swift and co-producers Max Martin and Shellback – “will prevail again. [Hall and Butler’s] claim is not a crusade for all creatives, it is a crusade for Mr Hall’s bank account.” On 9 December, Fitzgerald refused Swift’s request for a summary judgment, which would have immediately ruled that she did not breach copyright. Fitzgerald wrote: “Even though there are some noticeable differences between the works, there are also significant similarities in word usage and sequence/structure,” adding that “the court cannot presently determine that no reasonable juror could find substantial similarity of lyrical phrasing, word arrangement, or poetic structure between the two works”. Lawyers for Hall and Butler said that the court “did the right thing”. “Our clients are finally moving closer to the justice they so richly deserve,” said lawyer Marina Bogorad. “The opinion … is especially gratifying to them because it reinforces the idea that their creativity and unique expression cannot be misappropriated without any retribution.” 3LW’s song charted at No 21 in the UK and No 81 in the US. Swift’s Shake It Off reached No 2 in the UK and No 1 in the US and is the biggest selling single of her career. This is not the first copyright case Swift has encountered with Shake It Off. In November 2015, R&B singer Jessie Braham alleged that the song plagiarised his 2013 song Haters Gonna Hate. He demanded $42m in damages from Swift and distributor Sony, but his lawsuit was dismissed based on a lack of factual evidence. A date for the new trial has yet to be announced. Its outcome could become a reputational issue for Swift, who has made a point of campaigning for artists’ rights in recent years and for pursuing parties who she believes have infringed her copyright. And these are not unfamiliar scenarios for Swift on either side of the divide. She gave British pop band Right Said Fred a writing credit on her 2017 single Look What You Made Me Do, which interpolated the melody of their 1992 song I’m Too Sexy. This year, she received a co-writing credit on teenage pop star Olivia Rodrigo’s song Deja Vu in acknowledgment of its similarities to her 2019 song Cruel Summer, written with Jack Antonoff and St Vincent AKA Annie Clark. In 2016, she revealed that she was a co-writer of This Is What You Came For, a song performed by Rihanna and written by Swift’s ex-boyfriend, Calvin Harris. She was previously credited under a pseudonym, Nils Sjöberg. Spotify recently named Swift the second most-streamed musician in the world in 2021. She was pipped to the top spot by Puerto Rican star Bad Bunny.",Arts/Music,Taylor Swift to face plagiarism trial over Shake It Off lyrics,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/10/taylor-swift-to-face-plagiarism-trial-over-shake-it-off-lyrics
12/10/2021,"Teetering over an arid cliff face above the sprawling Chilean capital, Bernardo Segura reviews the footage from the camera trap and lets out a yell of excitement as the images reveal a flickering striped tail. On the screen displaying the conservationist’s latest video capture is an Andean cat – the most endangered feline in the Americas. Looking a little like a miniature snow leopard, the 4kg (9lb) male enters the frame and begins spray-marking the shrubs at the base of the cliff, before stealing away through sharp rocks with his banded brown and grey tail aloft.  Segura is excited for many reasons. With a shrinking population of fewer than 1,400 mature Andean cats left, any sighting is good. But this one heralds a signal of hope in a different way for the species and the conservationists battling against the cats’ extinction because it confirms a new population living close to humans – on the very edge of Santiago, a city of eight million people. “We have never found a population so close to a large city before,” says Segura. “This changes what we know about Andean cats and may offer some solutions to how to protect this and other species in the wider mountain ecosystem, which is highly under-studied. Finding one of the most elusive animals in the world just outside Santiago strikingly illustrates this.” Until now, Andean cats were believed to live only in extremely remote rocky terrain far from cities. But after seeing high numbers of the cats’ favourite prey – rodents from the chinchilla family called mountain vizcachas – around the popular Parque Mahuida nature reserve on the edge of Santiago, Segura trusted a hunch and in February placed camera traps on a terraced precipice above the neighbourhood of La Reina, about 2.5km, or 1.5 miles, from Santiago. In July, he had his first images of an Andean cat. Since then, his camera has taken about 40 more. “So far, we have identified at least three individual adults passing continually, suggesting this is the core of their territory and not just a chance encounter,” says Segura, who volunteers for the non-profit organisation Andean Cat Alliance (AGA), a coalition of conservationists who coordinate their efforts across Chile, Argentina, Peru and Bolivia. “For several of the cats to be living so close to a huge city will open many doors for research,” he adds. “Trips to the field are usually complicated, far away and difficult to reach, but I can see this site from my own apartment with a long lens. “We can come here every week with a short hike, and build a better picture of their behaviour and distribution. We have excellent internet coverage, so can even do real-time monitoring with remote cameras, which in isolated areas is practically impossible.” Having easy access to a population will help the AGA tackle key issues in the conservation of Andean cats, including the collection of scat, or faeces, for genetic analysis. This is hard to find in their other known habitats – huge territories that span the higher Andean peaks, and on the northern part of the Patagonian steppe in Argentina. Previous research had identified five highly fragmented populations between the four countries, stretching north to south between Peru and Argentina. “A primary aim is to work out if these Andean cat populations are linked or isolated,” says AGA’s general coordinator, Dr Rocío Palacios, a specialist in felines for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). “It’s important to know what we are working to conserve,” she adds. “Because information has only been gathered on Andean cats for the last 20 years, there are a lot of basic aspects that still need to be understood. A genetic understanding of the species can identify if there are isolated populations, which often require enhanced protections.” Some of the greatest threats to the cats come from extractive industries around the Andes, such as mining, quarrying and fracking, which destroy their habitat and consume massive amounts of water, draining the animals’ sources dry. Segura published a paper in May on another discovery of Andean cats, in Valparaíso, a mountainous coastal region north of Santiago city. In the paper he warns of the threat posed by plans for a large-scale open pit mine called the Vizcachitas mining project, which is being developed in the area. Nicolás Lagos, AGA’s Chile coordinator, says: “The need for the conservation of these newly discovered populations of the Andean cat around central Chile should be a priority. There are now three mega-mining projects threatening them, so if we don’t move fast, we’ll be witnessing their local extinction.” Another threat is hunting by farmers indiscriminately eliminating any predators near livestock, while the IUCN also lists the climate crisis as a serious threat to Andean cats – Chile is enduring a decade-long drought, with annual rainfall deficits of 30-70% when modelled against the last 1,000 years. The Andean cat has also suffered from its low profile, even among experts, says Palacios. “The Andean cat has been a very unknown species for a long time. A lot of our work has focused on pushing for them to be more considered in the global conservation agenda. “It was a species that was disappearing through our fingers,” she adds. “Even people who know a lot about cats didn’t know about them, but if feels like that is changing.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment,Most endangered cat in Americas found living on outskirts of Chilean capital,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/10/most-endangered-andean-cat-americas-found-living-on-outskirts-of-chilean-capital-santiago-aoe
