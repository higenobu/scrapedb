1/7/2022,"Wes Anderson is to make a second adaptation of a Roald Dahl story, 12 years after the success of his stop-motion version of Fantastic Mr Fox. The production is backed by Netflix, which recently purchased the rights to Dahl’s full catalogue. According to Daily Mail reporter Baz Bamigboye, Anderson is to direct an adaptation of the short story The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar, first published in 1977, about a gambler who studies meditation to acquire the ability to see through cards – and then opens a string of orphanages with his winnings. Benedict Cumberbatch will play the title role.  Netflix acquired Dahl’s full catalogue from the Roald Dahl Story Company in September 2021 after licensing 16 of Dahl’s best-known titles in 2018; this original agreement, Netflix said at the time, alerted the company to the possibility of the “creation of a unique universe across animated and live-action films and TV, publishing, games, immersive experiences, live theatre consumer products and more”. Already in development are two TV series from Jojo Rabbit’s Taika Waititi – Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Oompa Loompas – and an animated series based on The Twits. Forthcoming feature films include an adaptation of the stage musical of Matilda starring Emma Thompson and directed by Matthew Warchus. Also in production is Wonka, an “origins” story featuring Timothée Chalamet as the young Willy Wonka; the licensing agreement with Warner Bros to make this film predates the Netflix deal. Anderson’s Fantastic Mr Fox was released in 2009 and featured George Clooney and Meryl Streep; described by the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw as “eccentric, whip-smart and very funny”, it was a moderate financial success and was nominated for two Oscars.",Arts/Film,Wes Anderson to make new Roald Dahl adaptation with Benedict Cumberbatch,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/07/wes-anderson-roald-dahl-benedict-cumberbatch-netflix-wonderful-story-of-henry-sugar
1/7/2022,"There’s something exhilarating about hearing someone tell the truth, especially now when so many people seem to believe that the difference between facts and falsehood is a matter of political affiliation or personal opinion. Watching Kamala Harris and Joe Biden speak in the Capitol Rotunda on the anniversary of the 6 January insurrection, hearing the president blame the brutal riot directly on Donald Trump and his supporters – it felt almost like exhaling, after holding your breath for too long. Yes, it’s a lie that the 2020 election was stolen. Yes, it’s a lie that the rioters swarming the Capitol building were genuine American patriots. Those are facts that can’t be stressed enough, that need to be said and repeated by the powerful and the widely respected.  Over the past few days, I’ve watched deeply moving interviews with the Capitol police officers who lived through the riot. Especially affecting was the PBS conversation with Sandra Garza, whose partner, Brian Sicknick, defended the Capitol against attackers and died the next day of a stroke; in Garza’s view, Donald Trump “needs to be in prison”. When I register my own jarringly adrenalized response to even the briefest film clip of the surging crowd calling out for blood, I know that I cannot begin to imagine what those who survived it – and their loved ones – continue to suffer. So it came as a relief to hear Biden emphasize the gravity and the dangers of political violence, as well as the urgent necessity of defending and upholding the constitution. It seemed vitally important to hear him say that January 6 needs to be remembered; that forgetting the past and moving on (as many Republican senators urge us to do) could conceivably pave the way for a second – and perhaps more catastrophic – assault on our government. Yet – like many listeners, I imagine – I couldn’t help wondering how many people were being convinced, how many minds were being changed by the reasonableness, the maturity and clarity of the president’s address. It’s not just that, as we keep hearing, Americans now inhabit two entirely alternate realities: one in which the Covid vaccine staves off disease, another in which inoculation causes infertility and ALS. Among the obstacles that stand in the way of changing hearts and minds is that our problems, as a nation, are older, deeper and more severe than Donald Trump’s megalomania. So even as it was satisfying to hear Biden hold Trump directly accountable for ramping up his base’s bloodlust, for watching the mayhem on TV and making no attempt to stop it, I kept recalling something I remember people saying in the immediate aftermath of the 2016 election: that the malevolent genie that Trump had unleashed from the bottle was unlikely to go back in. Five years later than seems truer than ever: My sense is that Trump could completely retire from public life tomorrow and the support for him and his ideas would remain undiminished. A half-dozen Capitol rioters were elected to office in November, and two dozen more plan to run in upcoming elections. What I wished that Biden had acknowledged was the fact that the raging, disruptive genie had inhabited the bottle long before “the defeated former president” ever popped the cork. I wished Biden had followed up his gratifying excoriation of Trump and his supporters with a commitment to seeking out and eradicating the roots of the alienation, resentment and fury that so deeply divide our country. Why – aside from the lying claims of a stolen election – had the rioters armed and armored themselves and traveled all the way to Washington? It struck me that many of Trump’s supporters may not be entirely anti-democratic so much as acutely (or unconsciously) aware of our democracy’s imperfections: its oligarchic edge. Biden may have reminded us that each of our votes matters equally. But the one thing I may possibly share in common with the thugs who invaded the Capitol is the pained awareness that my voice is not nearly as audible in Washington as the voices of the chief executives of Pfizer, Delta, and Target. I thought of how, during the Great Depression, Eleanor Roosevelt toured the country, asking beleaguered American about their hardships and needs. How little of that seems to be happening now, when the consensus appears to be that our wounds can be healed remotely, by cajoling recalcitrant lawmakers into passing legislation with potential benefits that have so far eluded many Americans’ understanding. Of all the horrific things that occurred on 6 January, among the most disturbing to me was Trump’s parting speech to the rioters when at long last he advised them to go home. “You’re very special,” he said. “We love you.” Like any cult of personality, Trump’s impassioned support more closely resembles an (admittedly one-sided) affair of the heart than a reasoned political choice. And, in my experience, few lovers have fallen out of love after being informed that the beloved is an egomaniac and a liar. Of course the best known cure for love is to find someone else, but what’s more useful, in the long run, is to understand why one became embroiled in a deceptive and unbalanced relationship, and to find a way of designing and inhabiting a brighter future. What I wished I’d heard in Biden’s speech was a persuasive vision of the more fulfilled and less tormented life that, we can only hope, awaits us in the event that the poisonous romance with violence and hatred sputters out – and is finally over.

1/7/2022,"Spider-Man swings from skyscraper to skyscraper, pirouetting and somersaulting across the skyline like a whirling dervish in zero gravity. He makes a sharp left and eventually slides through his Queens bedroom window before removing his mask and settling down into Peter Parker mode. But who is it beneath the red and blue suit? In the mainstream Marvel Cinematic Universe, it’s likely that Tom Holland will continue for some time to come, which has left rival studio Sony (which owns the big-screen rights to Spidey) with a longstanding problem: its superhero flicks set in the world of Spider-Man, such as the Tom Hardy-led Venom movies and the forthcoming Jared Leto film Morbius, are much weakened by the fact that the wallcrawler can’t actually turn up.  In comic-book terms, this is a bit like making a movie about Gotham City and leaving out Batman. In Venom’s case it is particularly ridiculous, because Spidey was intimately involved with the origin of the toothy antihero in the comics. Fortunately for Sony, it’s also a problem that the recent Spider-Man: No Way Home appears to have solved, at least in part. That movie is set in the MCU and features the friendly neighbourhood Holland as the webslinger. But it also brings back various Spider-Men and their supervillain counterparts from previous Sony movies, as a result of Doctor Strange accidentally ushering in the multiverse with a spell aimed at restoring Spidey’s secret identity. Now some fans are calling for those returning Spider-Men, played by Tobey Maguire (Spider-Man and its two sequels) and Andrew Garfield (the two Amazing Spider-Man films) to be given their own future spin-offs. Frankly, it is hard to see why this shouldn’t happen: the move would suit Sony, which would get to add its own Spider-Man to existing projects while still benefiting from the success of Holland in the MCU. Audiences might get a little confused for a while, but only if they have not seen No Way Home; given the film’s huge box office success and the fact it will presumably make its way to streaming services at some point, that may not be an issue for long. it’s time to give andrew garfield the long overdue amazing spider-man 3 film that he deserves pic.twitter.com/gvW9eOdkor There are already rumours circling that Garfield and Maguire could team up for a Sony-led buddy movie titled Spider-Men – which sounds like a bit of a retread of No Way Home’s plotline – as well as suggestions that Maguire could appear in the forthcoming Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, a move that would require reshoots. Given the latter film is being directed by Sam Raimi, who made the first three Spider-Man films, and the huge hype generated by No Way Home after it was leaked that the movie would bring back past Spideys, the studio would be well advised to get working on the reshoots now. Would Garfield and Maguire want to return? The very fact that both were convinced to appear in No Way Home suggests they felt they had unfinished business. At 46, Maguire would be playing a very different version of the wallcrawler to the one we’ve come to know and love on the big screen (Garfield isn’t much younger, at a baby-faced 38.) Peter Parker has rarely been portrayed as older than his 30s in the comics, but there is the little-known 2006 limited run Spider-Man: Reign to draw on if the studio wants to go down a Dark Knight Returns-style path. It could work. Where Maguire has the advantage is that the villains featured in Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2 are both among the greatest in comic-book movie history. Following his barnstorming return in No Way Home, Willem Dafoe’s Green Goblin is probably fighting it out with Heath Ledger’s Joker for the mantle of greatest big-screen supervillain of all time, with Alfred Molina’s Doc Ock not far behind. It would take some clever writing to bring both back to the dark side after they were ostensibly cured at the tail end of No Way Home, but it could be done. Still, it seems to me that Sony might be best served by restoring its Spider-Men in future Venom and Morbius movies, which could certainly use the extra hype. Sony’s Spider-Man universe never made any sense without the main player, and the studio is now in the perfect position to restore a little Spider-sense to proceedings.",Arts/Film,Wider web: has Sony created a whole new world of Spider-Men?,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/07/wider-web-has-sony-created-a-whole-new-world-of-spider-men
1/7/2022,"More than 400 weather stations around the world beat their all-time highest temperature records in 2021, according to a climatologist who has been compiling weather records for over 30 years. Maximiliano Herrera keeps track of extreme weather around the world, and publishes an annual list of records broken in the previous year. He and many other climatologists and meteorologists who follow these issues closely expect that 2021 will probably not be the hottest year in history (Noaa and Nasa will publish their results in the next few days).  But it is likely to be in the top five or six, continuing the long-term upward trend. The past six years have been the six hottest on record. And, as is now the norm, several heat records have been broken, according to Herrera. Ten countries – Oman, UAE, Canada, the United States, Morocco, Turkey, Taiwan, Italy, Tunisia and Dominica – broke or tied their national highest record, 107 countries beat their monthly high temperature record, and five beat their monthly low temperature record. A few continental and planetary records fell too: Africa had its warmest June and September ever. August brought 48.8C (119.8F) in Syracuse, Italy, the highest temperature ever recorded in Europe. July had already brought 54.4C (130F) in Furnace Creek in the US’s Death Valley – the highest reliably recorded temperature on Earth. (A temperature recorded as 129.9F in 2020 was also rounded up to 130F.) But there were a few specific events that particularly stood out for experts. For meteorologist Patricia Nying’uro, a co-founder of Climate Without Borders and based at the Kenyan Meteorological Department, the two consecutive failed rain seasons in Kenya were unusual, and forced the government to organise for food aid for the first time in many years. “You can certainly see the effect of climate change in our weather in Kenya, and globally. We’re just putting together the data for 2021, but we think we will have seen an annual temperature which is 2.1C higher than normal for some parts of the country. The shifts are very noticeable, from one extreme to another in a very short space of time.” This was one of the reasons Nying’uro helped found CWB, a group of broadcast meteorologists and weather presenters from around the world who share information on extreme weather events. They also support weather presenters to make the connections with climate change and communicate these to the public. Meteorologist Scott Duncan, who collects data on world weather, pointed to the European summer heatwaves, which broke records in a number of countries – and were accompanied by wildfires around the Mediterranean. They had been preceded by a hot March, a sharp cold shock in early April which “was catastrophic for many agricultural businesses in France”, and then the floods in July. “Those events really stood out for me.” He also highlighted the heat in Alaska in December, where a number of records were broken by a large margin. “That was extraordinary.” China experienced its hottest ever year, according to the China Meteorological Administration. But it was the rain that hit the central province of Henan that really shocked: the region was hit by more rain in three days than it normally receives in an entire year. Hundreds died, crops and homes were destroyed, and the cleanup continues. Jia Xiaolong, deputy head of the National Climate Centre, said the situation last year had been abnormal. “Warming was the main theme of China’s climate in 2021. In the context of global warming, recurrent extreme weather and climate events have become the norm, which is also a major challenge to disaster prevention and mitigation.” Other key unusual weather events last year were the Siberian heatwave in the summer, and the deep freeze in Texas in February. Nearly 200 people died, millions of homes were without power, and the fallout led to huge political rows. Guy Walton, an activist meteorologist who has been campaigning on climate change since the late 1980s said “the cold outbreak in February 2021 leading to the failure of the power grid in Texas and dozens of deaths” was “ironically attributed to climate change by many”. He also highlighted “the extraordinary mild/warm fall leading to the warmest December on record for the United States. The National Centers for Environmental Information should make this official in the next couple of days.” But the key event of 2021 for the meteorological and climatological community was the extreme heatwave that struck the west coast of the US in June/July, led to a heat dome and broke records by up to 5C in some places. At the time, Geert Jan van Oldenborgh (who died in October 2021) of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute called it “way beyond the upper bound” and “surprising and shaking”. “Of course 2021 was full of extreme events,” said Herrera. “But if I have to name one, I’ll name what struck every single climatologist and meteorologist in the world.” Herrera nicknamed the event “the mother of all heatwaves”. “I confess, I would have never believed this to be even physically impossible. The magnitude of this event surpassed anything I have seen after a life of researching extreme events in all modern world climatic history in the past couple of centuries.” Meanwhile, 2022 has begun with a number of records already shattered in the UK and the US in the first few days of the year.",News/World news,"Heat records broken all around the world in 2021, says climatologist",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/07/heat-records-broken-all-around-the-world-in-2021-says-climatologist
1/7/2022,"In 1953, scientists at the University of Chicago observed that people dream much more frequently during certain deep phases of sleep characterised by “rapid movements in both eyes, choppy breathing, irregular heartbeat and fast brain waves”. As the Brazilian neuroscientist Sidarta Ribeiro explains in his new book on the history of dream research, the discovery of what became known as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep had profound implications. Where Sigmund Freud had postulated that dreams are an articulation of our deepest desires, neuroscience seemed to suggest they are in fact “purely random by-products of a strictly physiological underlying reality, and therefore of no psychological significance”; as such, the work of understanding dreams lay beyond the purview of science, “a matter for charlatans, fortune-tellers, priests, psychoanalysts and other professionals in the metaphysics business”.  Ribeiro looks to bridge the gap between neuroscience and psychoanalysis by drawing attention to various studies that suggest a scientific basis for psychoanalytic dream theories. Electrophysiological experiments carried out on rats in 1989, for example, showed that neurons activated while awake were specifically reactivated during subsequent sleep, which supports the idea, advanced by Freud in The Interpretation of Dreams (1899), that dreams constitute a “day residue” – a revisiting of memories and emotions experienced during waking life. Research by the South African neuropsychologist Mark Solms has demonstrated that the brain’s dopaminergic reward system is activated during REM sleep, leading Ribeiro to deduce that “the Freudian proposition that desire is the motor of dreams is much more factual than its critics would acknowledge … Dreaming ‘is’ desire because both ‘are’ dopamine.” Ribeiro precedes his scientific disquisition with a lengthy survey of notable dreams in politics and culture from antiquity to the modern day. Many of these are premonitory, prophetic or revelatory in nature. We learn that both Xerxes and Alexander the Great were inspired in their expansionist adventures by megalomanic dreams; Julius Caesar’s wife, Calpurnia, foresaw her husband’s demise in a nightmare on the eve of his assassination; when Prince Frederick III of Saxony was asked to extradite Martin Luther to the Holy Roman Emperor after he had torched a papal bull, he declined to do so after having a revelation in a dream, and thereby altered the course of European history. Artists and musicians as varied as Albrecht Dürer, Marc Chagall and Paul McCartney have produced major works inspired by dreams; Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s famous poem Kubla Khan was largely composed during a deep sleep following an opium binge; the chemist August Kekule discovered the hexagonal structure of benzene after dreaming about a snake eating its own tail. The Oracle of Night contains a number of interesting insights into the science of sleep. These include the intriguing possibility of a link between dreams and psychosis, an idea first mooted by psychiatrists Emil Kraepelin and Eugen Bleuler in the early 20th century and seemingly borne out by investigations into the effects of dopamine on rodents, which indicate that “the mental disturbances of psychosis make the differentiation between fantasy and reality difficult precisely because they are the result of an invasion of waking by sleep”. Another is the discovery, after experiments into sleep deprivation in mice, that sleep helps consolidate memory – meaning people who nod off straight after learning something are more likely to retain the information. Ribeiro believes educationists should therefore adopt a “biologically more intelligent” approach to school timetables, and predicts we will eventually see the introduction of “napping rooms or siesta clubs … [and] individual pods for sleeping” in educational institutions. “The brain that dreams is the same brain that lives through waking experience”, so it’s unsurprising that there’s a correlation between real-life anxiety and bad dreams: research has shown a high incidence of nightmares among children from conflict-ridden parts of the world such as the Gaza Strip and Kurdistan compared with those in peaceful, northern European cities; studies also indicate a greater prevalence of sleep problems in low-income communities. The recurring vivid nightmares common to PTSD sufferers are an extreme version of this phenomenon: “The memory of the violent event, having been so powerfully codified, is too intense, it possesses very strong synaptic connections, which makes them capture and monopolize the electrical activity produced during sleep.” Ribeiro, a professor at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, is an erudite guide through some rarefied terrain, and Daniel Hahn’s translation from the Portuguese reads seamlessly. That said, the scientific explanations aren’t always easy to follow and the writing occasionally lapses into a specialist register. The study of dreams is an inherently transdisciplinary pursuit – encompassing neuroscience, biochemistry, psychobiology and anthropology – so offshoots and digressions are to be expected. All the same, a more hands-on editor might have trimmed some of the considerable fat here, which includes, among other things, idle conjectures about the dream repertoires of animals and Palaeolithic people; a segment on the evolution of the earliest multicellular beings; an overview of funerary rites in the Neolithic and bronze ages; a potted history of the concept of madness; reflections on the persecution of astronomers Giordano Bruno and Galileo; a vignette in praise of Bruce Lee; and some personal broadsides on cancel culture and populism. There are some amusing titbits in among the sprawl, however. The writings of St Augustine of Hippo reveal that the celibate, fourth-century theologian was racked with guilt after having had some steamy sexual dreams. Agonising over whether they constituted a sin, he takes pains to stress that whatever pleasure he experienced while asleep was endured only with the greatest reluctance. The 11th-century French monk Raoul Glaber, whose Benedictine order forbade lie-ins, “left a record of being assailed by a demon whose temptation consisted of whispering in his ear that he should ignore the bell and surrender to the ‘sweet repose’ of the second sleep”. The bombardment of facts and esoterica gradually gives way to a polemical treatise on the science of the mind, and a through-line of sorts. Ribeiro believes psychiatry lost its way in the second half of the 20th century: when it turned its back on Freud, it essentially turned its back on the whole idea of the psyche; the reduction of human souls to pure physiology – a mere matter of neurons and synapses – has been a boon to big pharma, but it is not serving people well. Ribeiro laments the overmedicalisation of psychiatry and our over-reliance on SSRIs as a mental health panacea, and advocates using psilocybin, ayahuasca and MDMA to treat depression and anxiety. He makes a persuasive case, but one wonders if he could have made it more briskly.  The Oracle of Night: The History and Science of Dreams by Sidarta Ribeiro is published by Transworld (£20).

1/7/2022,"Are you British and reading this piece at the age of 94? If so, as you will know, you may actually have fought in the second world war. Widen the metric to anyone born by the end of the conflict, and the demographic swells: 76 and up. Even so, the greater part of the country could only know the era through parents, grandparents or grandparents’ parents. Yet January has still begun with two new depictions of wartime Blighty. Such is British film. Whatever year the calendar says it is, the nation’s cinema is always here to put an arm a little too tightly around your shoulder and pull you into a fusty back room to look at its Airfix Lancaster Bombers.  The first of the new films, Munich: The Edge of War, adapted from Robert Harris’s novel, in fact unfolds in the last moments of peace, as Hitler carved up Czechoslovakia. Dial forward to 1943 and the second movie is Operation Mincemeat, a true story of deception plotted in a Whitehall basement. In each, the Nazi menace looms before expertly tensed British actors. The cast of Mincemeat is led by Colin Firth and Matthew Macfadyen; in Munich, Jeremy Irons is Neville Chamberlain, George MacKay a jittery adviser. Britain has made a remarkable amount of films about the war. But as with any genre, not every one is alike. Moods change. Like canny politicians, the trick is to channel them. To make the right war film at the right time, tuned into the British id. So something telling may be happening with these two new movies. In each, patriotism now comes with caveats. The atmosphere is less than triumphal. Of course, Munich could hardly fail to be downbeat. But if Operation Mincemeat is a tale told with the larky air of a heist movie, cynicism colours it, too. Of its two leads, Macfadyen is overshadowed within his own family by a dead war-hero brother. Firth also has sibling issues. His is suspected of being a communist spy. And in British high command, plenty are as interested in personal vendettas and their own postwar careers as thoughts of noble sacrifice. It makes quite a contrast with the last cluster of British war films, which began in 2016 with the release of Dad’s Army. A few months later came Their Finest, Gemma Arterton cast as a scriptwriter drafted into a propaganda film about Dunkirk. By summer 2017, Christopher Nolan had released the actual Dunkirk. It became a sensation. It was followed by another smash, Darkest Hour, which saw Gary Oldman morph into Churchill under heavy prosthesis. The movie was the second such biopic in the same cycle; a year before, Churchill saw the PM played by Brian Cox. And in the middle of it all, of course, was the EU referendum. Aside from the sheer explosion of product, the tone of the biggest hits was striking. Dunkirk was an Imax blockbuster tightly focused on the microcosmic courage of ordinary Britons; Darkest Hour saw a cometh-the-hour Churchill communing with the public on the Tube. Neither was made in response to the Brexit vote. By then, Darkest Hour was already greenlit; Nolan was shooting Dunkirk in Swanage. But each was patriotic, a lavish British whipper-upper. As successful movies do, they caught the mood. They tapped the id. Of course, it would be just the kind of weird exceptionalism to which Britain can be prone not to register that other countries’ films also fixate on wartime glory. Russian box office records were broken in 2019 by T-34, a movie named after, and tied up with, a Red Army tank. Last year Chinese audiences made The Battle at Lake Changjin – a Korean war epic of a clobbered America – the most popular film in national history. Britain’s equivalents are an inch less gung-ho, and yet cinema remains the place where we roll out wartime memories. That is only fitting. Whatever pathology surrounds Britain and the second world war, movies helped make it. The conflict began in the heyday of cinema; British films were put to work as propaganda. They did it wonderfully. The problem was, it proved hard to lose the habit. The audience stayed in their seats even as the real thing slipped out of view. How could second world war films not be addictive? They offered Britain an endless national Marvel movie. The particular British identity that came with the package diffused through a million screenings of The Dam Busters on bank holiday telly. As the country fractured, second world war movies remade us whole. When Britain felt small, they enlarged us. And if the ghosts of empire threatened a guilty conscience, they recast us as an underdog nation of little boats. Who wouldn’t vote for that? Old news, of course. But although the conveyor belt of war movies has rolled on since 2016, the national mood has shifted. Five years after Nolan’s Dunkirk, the shine has come off. Britain is in a more sceptical place now. So, too, are its second world war films. These are still mainstream stories. Operation Mincemeat is not the film, for instance, to tackle misgivings about Churchill. But it feels a lot less giddy and a little more grown-up, from the shits climbing the military hierarchy to the knowing wink at how much fiction war involves. And the past looks different too in Munich: The Edge of War. For one, its Chamberlain is an idealist and strategist, desperate to keep the peace after the horror of the first world war, buying time for Britain when he can’t. Historically, the jury remains out on that. It still makes some novelty for British cinema. Churchill can’t be Churchill without Chamberlain as his antithesis; the feeble boob before the fearless bulldog. Chewier yet is the focus put on an anti-Hitler plot from inside Germany, based on the thwarted Oster conspiracy – one that in a different timeline might have lopped the head from Nazism in 1938. British dramatists have long loved counterfactuals in which we were successfully occupied. Munich offers a new How About: what if the Nazis had withered and the war never happened at all? Where would modern Britain be now? If that weren’t a mind-bender enough, a related question might ask the same of British films. The answer comes close to the unthinkable. So many actors, so many costume departments, all needing another script. Of course, in reality, they never did. And they won’t. Now, as in 1945, British cinema will dim the lights and restart the sirens, making sure we’ll meet again, the way we always do. Munich: The Edge of War is in cinemas now and on Netflix on 21 January; Operation Mincemeat is in cinemas from 22 April.",Arts/Film,Battle fatigue: will British cinema’s second world war obsession ever end?,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/07/battle-fatigue-will-british-cinemas-second-world-war-obsession-ever-end
1/7/2022,"Ayear on from the Capitol attack by loyalist supporters of Donald Trump, many families are still reeling from members outing each other to law enforcement and offspring traumatized by their parents’ involvement in the insurrection.  Jackson Reffitt, a 19-year old from Texas, called the FBI weeks before his father, Guy Reffitt, stormed the US Capitol on January, saying that his father had been hinting at doing “something big”, Teen Vogue reported. In text messages obtained by the magazine, Jackson’s younger sister texted their father in a family group chat, writing: “Dad, please be safe!! You know you are risking not only your business but your life too.” Guy Reffitt replied: “I have no intention on throwing it away. I love ALL of you with ALL my heart and soul. This is for our country and for ALL OF YOU and your kids. God bless us, one and all … ” Guy Reffitt has since been charged with numerous crimes. The charges relate to obstruction of an official proceeding, obstruction of justice for threatening his children, transporting firearms with the intention of using them during the mob attack on the Capitol, and a misdemeanor charge of accessing Secret Service-protected grounds without lawful authority. While in jail awaiting trial, the senior Reffitt texted news reports to the family group chat that featured photos of himself at the riots. Jackson told Teen Vogue that as the attacks unfolded, live on television, he received a phone call from the FBI, asking him to confirm his father’s identity and he confirmed that it was his father at the riot. Jackson now lives away from his family and rarely communicates with them. “He used to be one of the best dads ever,” he told the magazine. “He made me the man I am today. He taught me to be honest, not to steal, all that cliche stuff. I believe he brought me up to do what I did.” When Jackson does talk to his mother, she calls him “the Gestapo”, referring to Nazi secret police. His older sister, Sarah, 24, reportedly remains in disbelief towards Jackson. According to Sarah, she knows that their father loves Jackson, which in turn makes her even more upset to accept the fact that her brother turned him in to the FBI. “It’s hard not to condemn Jackson in defending my father,” she said. “I’m not gonna call [my dad] a hero for going [to the Capitol],” she added, but said: “He’s a hero to me because he’s my dad, but not for that.” Sarah also does not think her father should be jailed as he awaits trial. Unlike the judge in Guy Reffitt’s case, she does not see her father as a danger to the community. In a jailhouse letter obtained by ProPublica, Guy Reffitt wrote: “January 6 was nothing short of a satirical way to overthrow a government. If overthrow was the quest, it would have no doubt been overthrown.” On Thursday, Joe Biden, and Liz Cheney, the Republican congresswoman and the co-chair of the Capitol attack select committee, spoke about how close the mob came to violently overturning the election result – but failed. Meanwhile, Robyn Sweet, the 35-year-old daughter of a Virginia man, Douglas Sweet, is dealing with being the daughter of a Capitol Hill insurrectionist. Douglas Sweet, a staunch Donald Trump supporter, has been sentenced to 36 months’ probation with one month of home detention, fined and ordered to perform community service. Robyn Sweet said that once, when she was protesting against schools being named after Confederate generals, she saw her father across a parking lot, standing under a Confederate flag with his friends. “It’s like we’re living these mirrored lives,” Robyn told the magazine. When a friend sent her a link to a news report that mentioned her father as one of the rioters arrested on 6 January, Robyn said she felt relieved because she knew he was safe. Since then, Robyn and her father have limited their conversation topics to only light ones. “We can’t even talk about religion, politics or current events,” she said. While Jackson and Robyn continue to remain in touch with their families, albeit to different extents, 19-year-old Helena Duke has not spoken to her mother, Therese Duke, since the day she found out that her mother was part of the Capitol mob. After a video showing Therese harassing a Capitol police officer and then being punched in the face surfaced online, Helena tweeted, in what has become a viral post: “Hi mom, remember the time you told me I shouldn’t go to [Black Lives Matter] protests because they could get violent … this you?” Helena has since moved across the country from her mother and says that they are barely in contact. “It horrifies me to this day that she did such a thing. I’ve attempted to close the last chapter of my life in order to heal fully,” Helena said. Nevertheless, Helena mourns the relationship that she used to have with her mother. “As a child, my mother was my idol. She was the ‘fun mom’ who all my friends adored. She was so loving and full of life. I wish people knew how painful it is to grieve the life of a parent who is still living,” Helena said. Since the riots, federal prosecutors have brought cases against 727 individuals over their involvement in the deadly riots.",News/US news,The youngsters who turned in their parents for their role in the Capitol attack,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/07/capitol-attack-riot-trump-family-parents
1/7/2022,"In the year since the deadly insurrection at the US Capitol, federal authorities have faced intense scrutiny for failing to detect warning signs on social media. After the 6 January insurrection, the US agency tasked with combatting terrorism and extremism, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has expanded its monitoring of online activity, with officials touting a new domestic terrorism intelligence branch focused on tracking online threats and sharing information about possible attacks.  A senior DHS official told the Guardian this week the department aims to track “narratives known to provoke violence” and platforms that have been linked to threats. The primary goal, the official said, was to warn potential targets when they should enhance security. In the days leading up to the anniversary of the riot, for example, the agency saw an uptick in activity on platforms tied to white supremacists and neo-Nazis and warned law enforcement partners when appropriate, the official said. This monitoring relies on DHS analysts, not artificial intelligence, and doesn’t target “ideologies”, the official added, but rather “calls for violence”. The Guardian spoke with Harsha Panduranga, counsel with the liberty and national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice, a not-for-profit organization that has tracked police and government entities’ online surveillance programs, about the US government’s monitoring of social media in the wake of 6 January. Although DHS says its online efforts are consistent with privacy protections, civil rights and civil liberties, the expansion of social media monitoring still raised concerns, Panduranga argued. Without proper safeguards, a new report from the center warns, the expanded social media surveillance could be both ineffective at preventing attacks and harmful to marginalized groups that end up targeted and criminalized by “counter-terrorism” efforts. The conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. Which US government agencies monitor online activity? Many federal agencies monitor social media, including DHS, the FBI, the State Department, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the US Postal Service, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the US Marshals Service and the Social Security Administration (SSA). Our work has primarily focused on DHS, FBI and the State Department, which make extensive use of social media for monitoring, targeting and information collection. Why do these agencies monitor civilians’ social media? The FBI and DHS use social media monitoring to assist with investigations and to detect potential threats. Some of those investigations do not require a showing of criminal activity. For example, FBI agents can open an “assessment” [the lowest-level investigative stage] simply on the basis of preventing crime or terrorism, and without a factual basis. During assessments, FBI agents can search publicly available online information. Subsequent investigative stages, which require some factual basis, open the door for more invasive surveillance, such as the recording of private online communications. The FBI also awarded a contract to a firm in December 2020 to scour social media and proactively identify “national security and public safety-related events” not yet reported to law enforcement. DHS’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) division says it relies on social media when investigating matters ranging from civil immigration violations to terrorism. Government entities also monitor social media for “situational awareness” to coordinate a response to breaking events. How broad is this surveillance? Some DHS divisions, including Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the National Operations Center (NOC) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), keep tabs on a broad list of websites and keywords being discussed on social media platforms. The agencies’ “privacy impact assessments” suggest there are few limits on the content that can be reviewed. Some assessments list a sweeping range of keywords that are monitored, including “attack”, “public health”, “power outage”, and “jihad”. Immigration authorities also use social media to screen travelers and immigrants coming into the US and even to monitor them while they live here. People applying for a range of immigration benefits also undergo social media checks to verify information in their application and determine whether they pose a security risk. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents can also look at publicly available social media content for a range of investigations, including probing “potential criminal activity” and are authorized to operate undercover online and monitor private communications. How has this surveillance expanded in the wake of the insurrection? The main new DHS effort we’re aware of is an initiative monitoring social media to try to identify “narratives” giving rise to violence. DHS says they’ll use social media to pinpoint tips, leads and trends. In September, for example, DHS warned there could be another attack on the Capitol in connection with a Justice for J6 rally. But reports showed that law enforcement personnel [and journalists] outnumbered the protesters, and there was no indication of violence at the protest. This shows how difficult it is to predict violence relying on social media chatter. How concerned are you about the potential for civil rights violations in the wake of 6 January? January 6 seems to be accelerating this emphasis on social media monitoring without sufficient safeguards. And the monitoring to identify “narratives” that may lead to violence is broad enough to sweep in constitutionally protected speech and political discussion on various issues. We’ve long seen that government monitoring of social media harms people in a number of ways, including wrongly implicating an individual or group in criminal behavior based on their online activity; misinterpreting the meaning of social media activity, sometimes with severe consequences; suppressing people’s willingness to talk or connect openly online; and invading individuals’ privacy. Authorities have characterized ordinary activity, like wearing a particular sneaker brand or making common hand signs, or social media connections, as evidence of criminal or threatening behavior. This kind of assumption can have high-stakes consequences. Can you share some specific examples that illustrate these consequences? In 2020, DHS and the FBI disseminated reports to law enforcement in Maine warning of potential violence at anti-police brutality demonstrations based on fake social media posts by rightwing provocateurs. Police in Kansas arrested a teenager in 2020 on suspicion of inciting a riot reportedly based on a mistaken interpretation of his Snapchat post, in which he was actually denouncing violence. In 2019, DHS officials barred a Palestinian student arriving to study at Harvard from entering the country allegedly based on the content of his friends’ social media posts. The student said he had neither written nor engaged with the posts, which were critical of the US government. In another case of guilt by association, the NYPD was accused of wrongly arresting a 19-year-old for attempted murder in 2012 in part because prosecutors argued his “likes” and photos on social media proved he was a member of a violent gang. That same year, British travelers were interrogated at Los Angeles international airport and sent back to the UK reportedly due to a border agent’s misinterpretation of a joking tweet. Is social media surveillance effective at identifying legitimate threats? Broad social media monitoring for threat detection purposes generates reams of useless information, crowding out information on real public safety concerns. Government officials and assessments have repeatedly recognized that this dynamic makes it difficult to distinguish a sliver of genuine threats from the millions of everyday communications that do not warrant law enforcement attention. The former acting chief of DHS’ Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) said last year, “Actual intent to carry out violence can be difficult to discern from the angry, hyperbolic – and constitutionally protected – speech and information commonly found on social media.” And a 2021 internal review of I&A reported that searching “for true threats of violence before they happen is a difficult task filled with ambiguity”. The review observed that personnel collected information on a “broad range of general threats” that provided “information of limited value”, including “memes, hyperbole, statements on political organizations and other protected first amendment speech”. Similar concerns cropped up with the DHS’s pilot programs to use social media to vet refugees. What groups are most impacted by this kind of surveillance? Black, brown, and Muslim people, as well as activists and dissenters more generally, are especially vulnerable to being falsely labeled as threats based on social media activity. Both the FBI and DHS have monitored Black Lives Matter activists. In 2017, the FBI created a specious terrorism threat category called “Black Identity Extremism” , which can be read to include protests against police violence. This category has been used to rationalize continued surveillance of Black activists, including monitoring of social media activity. In 2020, DHS’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis used social media and other tools to target and monitor racial justice protestors in Portland, Oregon, justifying this surveillance by pointing to the threat of vandalism to Confederate monuments. DHS then disseminated intelligence reports on journalists reporting on this overreach. Muslim, Arab, Middle Eastern, and South Asian communities have often been particular targets of the US government’s discriminatory travel and immigration screening practices, including social media screening. How do you think the government should be responding to the intelligence failures of 6 January? A Senate committee report from last year found that DHS failed to produce a specific warning connected to what would happen on 6 January. An FBI field office had circulated a warning about an online threat with a specific call for violence, but it didn’t convince officials to better prepare for the attack. I think one takeaway from these failures is that broadly monitoring social media for scary things people are saying, without any further reason to suspect wrongdoing, tends to flood warning systems with useless information. This makes it harder to pick out what matters and sweeps in thousands of people who haven’t or wouldn’t do anything violent. Intelligence and law enforcement agencies already have ample and potent tools to investigate far-right violence without relying on indiscriminate social media monitoring, but they are not using these tools as effectively as they should. Instigators of the 6 January riot, for example, were members of groups that were already known to law enforcement. Some of them had previously participated in organized far-right violence, yet authorities did not bring charges or fully investigate the criminal activities of these organizations. So more indiscriminate surveillance isn’t the answer – in fact, such measures are much more likely to harm the very communities that are already at greater risk.",News/US news,US Capitol attack: is the government’s expanded online surveillance effective?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/07/us-capitol-attack-government-online-surveillance
1/7/2022,"Good morning. Joe Biden marked the anniversary of the Capitol attack with his strongest denunciation yet of his predecessor, accusing Donald Trump and his allies of placing a “dagger at the throat of American democracy”.  Condemning Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election as a “failed” pursuit, Biden underlined that the insurrection continues to endanger American democracy as the lies that led to the violence persist. In a show of just how divided Washington remains, there were only two Republicans on the floor of the House of Representatives when the speaker, Nancy Pelosi, presided over a moment of silence: the former vice-president Dick Cheney and his daughter, the congresswoman Liz Cheney. The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, who was in Georgia for the funeral of a former colleague, issued a statement calling the attack “antithetical to the rule of law”. The potential for a future stolen election is higher than ever, Sam Levine warns in his analysis of the continuing machinations. Since the insurrection, Republicans have powered ahead with efforts to undermine the processes of election administration and vote counting. The forceful denunciation “cannot have been easy” for Biden, who favours bipartisanship and ran on a platform of national unity, writes David Smith in his analysis. It shows that Biden understands the “threat must be looked squarely in the eye”. What did Trump say? He had planned to hold a news conference from Mar-a-Lago, but canceled under pressure from conservative allies. Nevertheless, he issued a series of statements maintaining the “big lie”. The true number of people lost to Covid in the US is likely to be higher than the official figure, experts have said, owing to the virus’s long-term effects and other fatal complications that have risen since the pandemic began. Since February 2020, there have been an estimated 942,431 excess deaths in the US, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with Hispanic, Black and Native American and Alaska Native populations disproportionately affected. But the CEO of insurance company OneAmerica, J Scott Davison, said the real death toll was likely to be higher, as the deaths that happen months after infection are not included in the figure. He said death rates among working-age people were up 40% over what they were pre-pandemic. What else has contributed to climbing death rates? Drug overdoses and homicides have also risen during the pandemic. Why are long Covid deaths difficult to tally? In some patients, the virus weakens organs or leads to new ailments – but may no longer be present at the time of death. Order has mostly been restored in Kazakhstan, president Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has claimed following days of protest during which more than 3,000 people have been detained and 26 killed, according to interior ministry figures. In an address on Friday morning, he said he had personally given orders to open fire with lethal force against protesters he called “bandits and terrorists”. The apparent end to the unrest comes a day after Russia sent “peacekeeping forces” numbering about 2,500 into Kazakhstan. Witnesses in the country’s largest city, Almaty, described chaotic scenes on Thursday, with government buildings stormed and torched. However, many said the protests – triggered by a spike in fuel prices as well as longstanding political and economic dissatisfaction – had started peacefully earlier in the week, before tipping into violence following the government’s crackdown. Why did Russia intervene? The Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) deployed troops within hours of Tokayev’s appeal. The move has been divisive, with some in Russia praising the action while other have compared it to the Soviet-era Warsaw Pact interventions. Ten bodies were crammed into an SUV and left in front of the office of a Mexican state governor, officials have said. The vehicle was left before dawn in the main plaza of the capital of Zacatecas – a state that has become one of the country’s most violent due to turf wars. Philadelphia deadliest fire in a century may have been caused by a five-year-old setting a Christmas tree alight, officials revealed on Thursday.

1/7/2022,"The NHS in England is experiencing the highest number of Covid absences since the vaccine rollout, with more than 40,000 staff unable to attend work on two days in the past week. An average of 35,596 staff were sick with Covid in the past week, a level last seen in January 2021 at the height of the second wave and higher than any week since all priority groups were offered at least their first vaccine in mid-February.  The number of NHS England staff off sick due to Covid rose by 41% in the week to 2 January, the latest health service figures show. The almost 36,000 average was up from 25,000 the week before. It is also the third week in a row that absences have risen by about 40%. These absence figures are still much lower than those seen during the first wave peak, when almost 83,000 were off due to Covid. Including non-Covid absences, more than 80,000 staff were absent each day on average, up from 71,000 the previous week. Almost half of staff absences are due to Covid (44%). Military personnel are being deployed to NHS trusts in London to help plug staff shortages. The NHS national medical director, Prof Stephen Powis, said the Omicron variant meant there were more patients to treat and fewer staff to treat them. “In fact, around 10,000 more colleagues across the NHS were absent each day last week compared with the previous seven days and almost half of all absences are now down to Covid. “While we don’t know the full scale of the potential impact this new strain will have it’s clear it spreads more easily and, as a result, Covid cases in hospitals are the highest they’ve been since February last year – piling even more pressure on hard working staff. “Those staff are stepping up as they always do; answering a quarter more 111 calls last week than the week before, dealing with an increasing number of ambulance callouts, and working closely with colleagues in social care to get people out of hospital safely. “You can help us to help you by ensuring you are vaccinated against Covid.

1/7/2022,"Paul Barry has spent much of the past two years striving to help preserve the two industries which have not merely shaped but enlightened and enriched his life. Recent, pandemic-stricken months have been challenging for the majority owner of assorted US-based travel companies and League One Cambridge United, yet 2022 has opened on a doubly optimistic note.  While Barry is confident tourism has begun a sustained, if still cautious, revival, Cambridge are also going places. On Saturday Mark Bonner’s team visit a sold-out St James’ Park for a third-round FA Cup tie against Newcastle with 5,000 away fans due. Geography dictates that Barry watches most Cambridge games on a live stream early in the morning at home in Seattle. “I can’t sit still; I’m jumping up and down in front of the television,” he says. “When we lose, my wife takes the dog out for a walk.” The best match days arrive when he flies to England to watch the team about six times a season, often sitting alongside his 85-year-old season-ticket-holding mother. Although she has opted to follow live radio commentary from her home in Cambridgeshire on Saturday, Barry will be in the directors’ box and is looking forward to meeting Amanda Staveley. Given that Newcastle’s co-owner recently revealed her own, considerable, struggles to stay seated when watching Eddie Howe’s side play, the pair should swiftly strike up a rapport. “Newcastle have reached out and offered us a great welcome,” says Barry, who has poured millions of pounds into Cambridge since joining the board in 2005 when a club now mid-table in League One fell into the Conference, beginning a nine-year Football League exile. “I know it’s going to be a brilliant occasion and a great experience.” He and Staveley probably have more in common than might initially be apparent. The recent takeover the latter spearheaded alongside her majority shareholding Saudi Arabian partners may remain controversial but it has undeniably reinforced the ties binding Newcastle to their north-east community. With supporters disillusioned and disenfranchised under the former, unloved owner Mike Ashley’s regime now re-engaged, Saturday’s mood should be celebratory and Barry understands precisely why. “The value of football clubs to their local communities has really been clarified during the pandemic,” he says. “They’ve proved they’re huge community assets – and also offer great entertainment. During lockdown, I watched a game a day – it helped me stop spending all my time worrying about stabilising Cambridge and the businesses.” Albeit remotely, Barry also helped co-ordinate the Cambridge United Community Trust’s much-lauded Careline initiatives throughout England’s lockdowns. Club staff and players helped older and vulnerable local residents with shopping and prescription collections, delivered free meals to families normally dependent on food banks, organised online activities for children missing school and made countless phone calls, offering friendly chats to anyone who might be isolated or lonely. “The Trust did a lot of community outreach work,” he says. “It shows clubs are about far more than just football, they unify people of all types, shapes, sizes and backgrounds. Football creates incredible bonds and those bonds were kind of strengthened during the pandemic. For me, the community work is one of the reasons to be involved in a club.” During the long months when fans were locked out of the Abbey Stadium last season Cambridge won promotion from League Two, enjoying one of the most memorable seasons for Barry since the days when, as a schoolboy in the 1970s, he travelled to matches on the bus with his father from their home village of Hauxton, five miles south-west of the city. “I always loved the feeling of being at games,” he says. “It becomes part of who you are – and there’s nothing like the great sense of camaraderie it produces.” This sense of belonging is similarly important to Bonner. Very much at the vanguard of football’s “new school” coaching cadre, Cambridge’s inspirational 36-year-old manager never kicked a ball professionally but, having started out running the Abbey Stadium’s under-eights, has risen through the ranks to become one of the club’s most successful recent managers. Barry’s own career trajectory has also proved slightly left field. After graduating in chemical engineering from Imperial College London in 1983 his wanderlust transported him to New York and a role as a reservations agent with British Rail. He soon joined a travel agency and, having eventually become its manager, branched out independently, establishing his own companies. After selling the Europe Express Group to First Choice Holidays in 2005 he found himself in a position to help keep Cambridge afloat. “Travel’s recovering this year,” he says. “It’s going to be stepping back up to 50% of 2019 levels, although you won’t see a full return to pre-pandemic levels until 2023.” Newcastle, too, remain in the early stages of recovery from long years of under investment under Ashley and despite Kieran Trippier’s arrival from Atlético Madrid this week, a team who have won only one game all season could, arguably, be vulnerable to a giant-killing. “If you’re rational, we don’t have a chance,” says Barry. “But football isn’t played on paper and I’m optimistic we won’t be overwhelmed. I just hope we all really enjoy being at a full St James’ Park and that it turns into a celebration of where we’ve come from and the journey we’ve made over the past 20 years.”",Sport/Football,"Paul Barry, the Cambridge fan turned owner whose mum still watches at 85",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/07/paul-barry-cambridge-fan-owner-mum-watches-at-85-newcastle-fa-cup
1/7/2022,"Calls for a “Hillsborough law” to rebalance the UK’s justice system and ensure fairer treatment for bereaved families will be made at a high-profile event on Friday. The Hillsborough Law Now summit will be co-hosted by the mayors of Greater Manchester and Liverpool, Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram, and will have speakers who include representatives of bereaved families from tragedies past and present.  It has been timed to build on the extra awareness of the issue, which has been revived by the powerful ITV drama Anne that tells the story of Anne Williams’ fight for justice for her teenage son Kevin. The actor Maxine Peake, who played Williams, is expected at the event, which will be livestreamed on Facebook. Campaigners are calling for measures that were recommended in a 2017 report by Bishop James Jones. The report had 25 recommendations including a charter for families bereaved through public tragedy; a statutory duty of candour on all police officers; “proper participation” of bereaved families at inquests; and a public advocate for families of the deceased after major incidents. The campaign says the failures of criminal trials related to Hillsborough have identified new areas that also need to be addressed and enshrined in law. Burnham said the “appalling treatment of the Hillsborough families at the hands of the legal system shames our nation”. But he said it was not unique. “From Peterloo 200 years ago to Grenfell today, ordinary bereaved families continue to be treated in a cruel and dismissive way by a justice system which favours the powerful and the connected. It is a pattern that keeps on repeating itself and it is time to break it. “We need to level up the scales of justice in favour of bereaved families so that the truth is established at the first time of asking. We must spare families the secondary trauma that is often inflicted by cruel treatment at the hands of the system.” Rotheram said: “What happened at Hillsborough in 1989 and the cover-up that followed is a national disgrace. It is a testament to the courage and determination of the families and campaigners that the truth was finally uncovered after decades of battling against the might of the state. That cannot be allowed to happen again. “The story of Hillsborough is not an outlier. There are countless other injustices that follow the same pattern. It is time that we broke that cycle and put integrity back at the heart of our justice system.” Ninety-five men, women and children died immediately or very shortly after they were trapped in the crush in the central “pens” of the Leppings Lane terrace at the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Sheffield Wednesday’s Hillsborough ground on 15 April 1989.
