2/5/2022,"A criminal-defense attorney began tracking Donald Trump's base online before the 2020 election. He has turned over information to a committee investigating the January 6 siege on the US Capitol. His monitoring has made him concerned about the safety of school board members, he told Insider. Ron Filipkowski, a criminal-defense attorney in Sarasota, Florida, who has been monitoring right-wing extremists online says he's now helping the House Committee investigating the January 6 attacks on the US Capitol. Filipkowski, a former longtime Republican, on Friday tweeted that he and his team have compiled ""hundreds of very obscure interviews and podcasts from the planners, leaders and participants"" of the siege on the US Capitol, most of which they've never posted. ""At their request, today we turned over all of them to the J6 Select Committee, catalogued and organized,"" he wrote. —Ron Filipkowski (@RonFilipkowski) February 4, 2022 Filipkowski told Insider that he interviewed with the committee members about three weeks ago and they asked him to try to put together everything his team thought would be of interest. ""So we spent the past few weeks just putting it all together for them,"" he wrote in a direct message on Twitter. ""Some of these podcasts only about 100 people have seen, but they are from very key players in J6. ""It's funny what people say doing a podcast with a friend when they think nobody is watching,"" he added. The news that Filipkowski is helping the committee comes the same day as the Republican National Committee voted to formally censure Republican Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois for their participation as members of the committee and criticism of Trump's role in the Capitol siege. Committee staff could be reached on Friday for comment. Filipkowski thanked his team of ""two patriotic moms,"" who he keeps anonymous, on Twitter for their hard work. ""We don't self-promote, ask for money, or sell things,"" he wrote. ""We volunteer this time just because we want to preserve this Republic for our kids."" The former Marine and state and federal prosecutor and two researchers monitor live-streamed events, podcasts, radio broadcasts, social media, and dark chat rooms. Every day, Filipkowski watches streamed video of the ""War Room"" podcast with Steve Bannon, Trump's former chief strategist in the White House, whom Filipkowski described in a December interview with Insider as a ""chaos agent."" He said then that his main concern moving forward was the safety of school board members, who have dealt with rowdy protests at meetings across the country over mask mandates, COVID-19 policies, and race and gender education. Filipkowski is prolific on Twitter, but he said in December that he shares only some of what he sees. The majority of it can't be shared because it includes ""violence, conspiracies, you know, crazy theories,"" things that would get him barred from Twitter, he said. ""For everything I post, I've seen 99 things worse,"" he said.

2/5/2022,"Nothing is worse than waking up in the middle of the night, sweating as if you've just run a marathon, and needing to climb out of bed to change your pajamas and sheets before you try (try!) to drift back to sleep. But that's exactly what 10 to 60 percent of the population experiences each year, according to research published in the ""Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine."" The question is, why? One common reason - and don't freak out - is hot flashes. Hot flashes can occur at any time during your menstrual cycle - day or night - and not just during menopause. ""Any hormone event that causes a significant decrease in estrogen affects the body's thermostat in the hypothalamus, which controls body temperature and can lead to hot flashes,"" Sherry Ross, MD, an ob-gyn at Providence Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, told POPSUGAR. While estrogen decreases leading up to menopause, it can also dip like clockwork during your monthly cycle, typically around the first day of your period and a few days prior to that. That said, other hormonal imbalances can also cause night sweating, explained Kristine Arthur, MD, an internist at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA. These include hyperthyroidism or adrenal disease, which occurs when the body doesn't produce enough cortisol or aldosterone. So, while your monthly cycle may be to blame for periodic night sweats, if you find it happens more frequently, it's worth making an appointment with your doctor to rule out other causes. ""Both of these conditions can be detected with blood and urine testing in your doctor's office and successfully treated with medications or other treatments,"" Dr. Arthur told POPSUGAR. There are also a number of other factors that can contribute to night sweats, including low blood sugar and certain medications like antidepressants, Dr. Arthur added. In some cases, night sweats can even be a sign of infection. ""If these episodes occur only at night, be sure to let your doctor know this, as well as mentioning any other symptoms you are having, any recent travel, or any exposure to people who may be sick,"" she said.
