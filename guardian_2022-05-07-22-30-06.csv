5/7/2022,"St Helens successfully defended the Women’s Challenge Cup as two tries from Eboni Partington helped them edge Leeds Rhinos in a thrilling final. The two standout sides in the Women’s Super League delivered a compelling contest in front of the largest crowd to watch a game of women’s rugby league, with almost 6,000 people in attendance before the two men’s Challenge Cup semi-finals later in the afternoon. With the score finely poised at 8-8 heading into the final quarter, a missed penalty from Leeds’s Courtney Winfield-Hill kept the game level and Saints took their opportunity with two tries to secure the cup. The outstanding Jodie Cunningham forced her way across from close range to nudge Derek Hardman’s side ahead for the first time. Then, with three minutes remaining, Partington added to her earlier try by converting in the corner after a superb pass from Amy Hardcastle. It means St Helens retain their position as the dominant force in the women’s game and their quest for a second successive treble remains intact. The valiant Rhinos led in the early stages when Georgia Roche’s pass led to Zoe Hornby breaking the deadlock, but St Helens soon hit back when Zoe Harris’s kick found Leah Burke. Beth Stott dragged the conversion wide to keep Saints behind by two, before Winfield-Hill landed a long-range penalty on the stroke of half-time to move Leeds into an 8-4 lead. Partington’s try after an error from Tasha Gaines brought the scores level, before Winfield-Hill spurned a glorious chance to put Leeds back in front with 15 minutes remaining. Saints made the Rhinos and Winfield-Hill pay when Cunningham forced her way through a gap to move them ahead, before Partington sealed victory in the closing moments.",Sport/Sport,St Helens win Women’s Challenge Cup after Eboni Partington sinks Leeds,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/07/st-helens-win-womens-challenge-cup-after-eboni-partington-sinks-leeds
5/7/2022,"When the artist Angela Chick began supplying greetings cards to Paperchase, she thought she’d made it. “As a small business owner, that’s kind of a dream,” the 36-year-old said. The stationery retailer ordered thousands of cards adorned with her “colourful, cheerful”, hand-drawn designs, to be sold at its 125 UK stores and concessions in Selfridges, Next and House of Fraser. But in late 2020, she says Paperchase stopped paying its invoices. Emails chasing payments went unanswered. Then, in January 2021, news broke that the company was going into administration, leaving Chick’s business more than £22,000 out of pocket. Sixteen months on, she is yet to be paid – and the chance of her ever recouping more than a tiny percentage of the money is slim. But while she and other artists continue to struggle, Paperchase stores are trading and thriving, albeit with a new owner. Shortly after going into administration, the chain was bought by the credit arm of a private equity firm. The controversial rescue deal enabled many stores to stay open and saved about 1,000 jobs, but it allowed the new owner in effect to shed millions of pounds in debts to suppliers, many of them small firms. It also bought about £7m worth of old stock, according to documents filed with Companies House, and went on to sell products that suppliers had not been paid for. Within months, business was reported to be booming once again. “I’m really pleased to say that the sun has been shining on us and we’re currently trading above plan,” Paperchase’s head of brand told a trade publication last May. For Chick, it has been “immensely stressful”. “I was going through this, and having people sending me photos of my cards still in their stores that were available for sale. It was like, ‘Hang on a minute. Somebody’s making money off these, but I haven’t.’ “Most customers have no idea,” she added. “Nothing changes in the shops; it’s still the same Paperchase.” Chick, from Portsmouth, is one of a group of artists from across the UK calling for increased protection for small businesses after they were left bruised – and in some cases facing bankruptcy – by the financial collapse of Paperchase last year. Though some were initially offered a proportion of the money after the administration was announced as a “goodwill gesture” – in Chick’s case 15% – she says the offer was conditional on them working with the new owners. “I couldn’t risk that happening again, so I refused,” Chick said. “I was thinking I’d just hold out because I might end up getting something. But I was very wrong about that.” In the latest twist, the new owner, Permira Credit, which is linked to a multibillion-pound private equity firm, is now said to be selling Paperchase. It has instructed advisers to manage the sale after receiving a number of “unsolicited inquiries” from potential buyers, according to Sky News, following an improvement in its performance. Another supplier, Sarah Ray, 40, said it “doesn’t feel fair” that the company is now being sold on. The financial blow for her business – £9,000 – meant she had to use personal savings to plug the gap. “There’s less there for the family, and with living expenses going up, it’s a worry,” she said. “For Paperchase, life carries on. But we’re just expected to take the hit, and who cares? It feels like they certainly don’t.” The treatment of Paperchase’s suppliers has led to calls for a boycott from some customers. After artists spoke out via Instagram, the company’s account was flooded with comments urging the stationer to “pay your suppliers”. “When are you going to pay all the small businesses you owe thousands of pounds to?” one person wrote. “So so so disappointed,” another said. While pre-pack administration deals like the one involving Paperchase can be a way of saving struggling businesses and making them viable again, critics say that they can be abused to offload debts. They are particularly controversial when parties connected to the failed business buy the assets of the old firm, because this allows them to wipe out the money they owe while in effect continuing to trade as the same company. In Paperchase’s case, the buyer, Permira Credit, had been an investor for several years; one of the directors linked to the old business – the chief executive, Oliver Raeburn – is involved in the new venture, and much of the stock was carried over. Paperchase’s suppliers were particularly badly hit because of reforms in December 2020 that changed the order in which creditors are paid, to prioritise HM Revenue and Customs. Meanwhile, as “unsecured creditors”, the independent companies that supplied the firm are the last to be paid, and were pushed “further down the pecking order”, according to Martin McTague, national chair of the Federation of Small Businesses. “Adding to the pain is the fact that companies in financial distress will often ramp up late payment of invoices before going under, leaving firms with the prospect of getting back only pennies in the pound on what they’re owed, or nothing at all,” McTague said. He called for “strong and decisive government action” to ensure companies are better protected in future. Liz Faulkner, 31, and her sister, Cat, run the greetings card business Jelly Armchair, which lost about £20,000 when Paperchase went into administration, leaving them on the brink of going under. Only after the death of a family member, which led to an inheritance, was the business able to survive. “Every time something like this happens, it makes things less equal. Not everyone has inheritance to fall back on,” Faulkner said. Permira Credit and Aspen Phoenix Newco, trading as Paperchase, declined to comment.",News/Business,Paperchase has been rescued but greetings card artists are losing thousands,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/07/paperchase-has-been-rescued-but-greetings-card-artists-are-losing-thousands
5/7/2022,"Home was never quiet growing up. It was a house always filled with people and laughter, and there was never a shortage of food or music. My parents had an open-door policy. Whether you showed up unannounced or with an invitation, you’d leave with a smile and a full belly. It’s no surprise to anyone who knows me in adulthood that as a child I was dramatic. I’ve always been outspoken. I loved to write and perform. I was that kid who makes speeches at the grownups’ birthdays. I acted through my teenage years. At 16, I did a comedy at Television Centre with Ashley Walters. When we snuck in to the wrap party, there may have been some underage wine drinking. I got home at 11pm. Mum and Dad had spent all night calling the BBC switchboard asking if anyone had seen me. My attention span is incredibly short. Every school report said the same: “engaged at the start, Charlene’s interest wanes quickly”. I love coming up with ideas, but seeing it through to the end is boring. I can’t change, trust me I’ve tried, so as an adult I find the positives. I’m never satisfied and always want new experiences. It might sound obvious, but do make sure to pick someone you think you’ll still like in a decade or two if you’re looking for a long-term relationship. Meeting Maya Angelou was like nothing else. Intelligent and beautiful, she was one of the Black women I grew up reading. When I walked in to interview her for BBC Radio 1, I was literally speechless. Seeing I was nervous, she graciously put me at ease, taking the lead in conversation to calm me down before starting. Afterwards, we recorded her reading her poem, And Still I Rise. I still get goosebumps. From adolescence to early adulthood I was awful with money. Bills and statements would sit in a drawer unopened; I never budgeted, and was financially illiterate. When my other half realised just how awful I was he made me knuckle down and fix it. The birth of my first child seemed smooth. It was blissful, holding our newborn. Hours later, my sister spotted something was wrong – I’d been haemorrhaging for hours. Nobody noticed. I lost a lot of blood and was rushed into surgery. It was only when I came round from the anaesthetic that I realised how serious it was. My family thought they’d lost me. I’ve never forgiven my dad for throwing away my beloved jacket. Beautifully made, it fit me like a glove – a once-in-a-lifetime purchase in my 20s. I left it in his spare bedroom. When he was moving and told me to collect it I never did, so it went in the bin. He says it’s my fault. I see it differently. Bananas terrify me, a real phobia. Eat one near me and I’ll walk away – the smell makes me gag. Doing the family shop in my teens I’d pick them up with a plastic bag over my fingers. I didn’t want to pass this on to my kids, so sucked it up successfully. Still, overripe bananas in my house are removed immediately. I take a typical Caribbean approach to parenthood: kids are taught independence early and I don’t pander to them; they know they don’t always need me. And I’m unapologetic about being a working mum. I have both a job and a family that I love and enjoy. It means I’m not there for every event in their life, but someone is. I choose not to feel guilty.

5/7/2022,"There aren’t many successful new groups these days. Just one of this year’s 40 bestselling albums is by a band formed in the past decade: rap collective D-Block Europe’s Home Alone 2. Perhaps we don’t need bands any more when there are one-man armies such as Deyaz (pronounced “Dee-as”) around. The 22-year-old singer-songwriter taught himself guitar, piano, bass and violin, and crafts intimate, intense music that shifts softly between genres. When Deyaz’s parents left London for Devon six years ago, he stayed behind, slipping into the life of a nomadic teenage bluesman, battling homelessness, anxieties and addiction, busking on guitar for rent and food. “You play a classical jazz piece, no one gives a fuck,” he says. “Thunderstruck by AC/DC? There’s £20 notes flying everywhere!” Deyaz grew a moustache to get a pub job when he was underage and while trying classical musical training at a conservatoire. Just like school, though, the structures and strictures of formal tutelage stifled him. He walked out and found his real education in everything from drumming in a punk band to producing grime. The first fruits of this are on his promising Why Not mixtape, with its haunted, yearning highlights Time and Bleed. His first proper gigs and some sound-widening EPs will follow. There are hundreds of songs in the Deyaz vault, and he plans to “suffocate myself in my own music” before finally finishing his debut album. He’s come a long way from being ignored on the streets.

5/7/2022,"A giant inflatable lobster convulses menacingly behind Dua Lipa. Sitting on the edge of an ersatz pool, back turned, she is singing about ending a mismatched relationship, oblivious to the threat. “We’re not meant to be, like sleeping and cocaine,” Lipa muses as the lobster writhes, its absurdity magnified by the fact that it is dry humping the stage rather than moving in for the kill. We’re in the middle of We’re Good, a minor single from the more recent deluxe edition of her pandemic-era hit LP Future Nostalgia, the silly peak of a slick arena show foregrounding witty kiss-offs to bad boyfriends and disco as embodied therapy. Lipa is 40 gigs into a massive, delayed world tour; one that, more than most, marks a return to some kind of normal. “I used to spend so many nights on my own,” goes her song Love Again. “I never knew I had it in me to dance any more.” Turns out, it’s like riding a bicycle. Despite a modest chart placing (25), We’re Good neatly encapsulates the appeal of Lipa, who is shaping up to be a pop star for the ages. With this upbeat album, originally released in March 2020, paying tribute to dancefloors past, she effectively became the hold music of the pandemic, as well as its indoor workout soundtrack. But Lipa first established herself as pop’s big sister with her debut hit, 2017’s New Rules, a dispenser of memorable, pithy relationship advice fashioned into pop with a flourish and a wink. (Lest we forget: “If you’re under him, you ain’t getting over him,” she counselled on New Rules, a huge singalong tonight.) The lobster, meanwhile, originally appeared in the heart-tugging video for We’re Good, the sole survivor of a tank full of crustaceans who end up on the dinner table of the Titanic, where Lipa colludes as the entertainment. Its vengeful intentions – and the singer’s sense of humour – are signposted tonight on a “menu” on the video screens, featuring “Dua Thermidor” and “Half-Dua on the shell”. It’s all ridiculous, wise and self-assured by turns. We’re Good leans on tropical pop, standing out on this all-dancing tour’s prevailing roller-disco vibe. Crucially, though, it fits a much larger template. The song’s bittersweet chorus sounds like a slew of other tracks – including, but not limited to, Charli XCX’s White Mercedes and the Byrds’ Mr Tambourine Man. Future Nostalgia was unquestionably a runaway success, an antidote to the fear, grief and pent-up frustration of Covid that won the pop vocal Grammy in 2021. But Lipa resonates with recent times all the more because of her knack for pulling off pop homages with just enough flair to impress, rather than land awry. Her album was packed with declared samples (INXS, White Town) and upfront quotes (“Let’s get physical!” Lipa commands, echoing Olivia Newton-John on Physical, the set opener), not to mention more subtle evocations of styles and vibes. But somehow – like her roller-skating dancer tonight who does a flip and rights himself gracefully on to his wheels, gliding away – Lipa continues to gild her hi-NRG house-disco composites with just enough dazzle to avoid a blizzard of lawsuits or any real backlash from pop fans, who love “inspiration” but hate copyists. She is currently battling two court actions for her song Levitating (naturally, she spends that song aloft on a platform high above her fans). But given the album’s nods and feints, it’s fascinating that there aren’t more. Back in 2015, Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams lost a landmark court case brought by the heirs to Marvin Gaye’s estate for lifting the feel of Gaye’s music, rather than any combination of notes, as copyright law was previously understood. You could ascribe the recent upswing in pop lawsuits to many causes – there will always be creatives with a legitimate case, as well as speculative suits. Last month, having fought off a copyright claim against Shape of You, Ed Sheeran made the point that there would inevitably be coincidental assonances between pieces of music when so much is being produced every day. But much pop now, including Lipa’s, seems to intentionally dance on a tightrope made of fissile material, with many hands ready to pull on the loose strands. None of this detracts from the joyousness or personality of her offering, a two-album, nonstop party whose brazen glee remains infectious. Not even a slew of arena tour cliches – confetti cannon, balloons, dancing with chairs – or a lacklustre collaboration with Elton John, who appears on a screen, can diminish the Dua effect. She strides up and down the runway with all the effortless confidence of “a female alpha” – a key lyric from the song Future Nostalgia. More importantly, her songs of flirtation, infatuation, recovery and resilience rarely fail to clock anything other than a very high emotional IQ. It all ends with Don’t Start Now, in which Lipa revives some simple dance moves she was mocked for earlier in her career. “Walk away, you know how!” she taunts a former lover. But she seems ready to take on all comers.",Arts/Music,Dua Lipa review – a pop star for the ages,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/07/dua-lipa-o2-london-review-world-tour-a-pop-star-for-the-ages
5/7/2022,"I tried to think of a pithy introduction to this week’s newsletter. Something witty, something drily poking fun at the dystopic week we’ve had. Something that was not yet another reference to Gilead and the Handmaid’s Tale. But, unfortunately, all jokes were drowned out with internal existential screaming: aaaarggh. First, there was the bombshell leak on Monday night of a draft supreme court opinion that appeared to show the court is ready to overturn Roe v Wade and the federal right to an abortion. While this was a shock it wasn’t exactly a surprise. When Donald Trump was elected plenty of people were worried about the future of reproductive rights in the US. Calm down, dear, we were told by Reasonable Rational People™. You’re being alarmist! Like clockwork, the Reasonable Rational People™ emerged right after the supreme court leak to chide anyone worried that Republicans are not going to stop at overturning Roe but want to take away even more of our rights. “I think the people catastrophizing about contraception or interracial marriage being next after Roe sincerely believe it,” a (female) Washington Post columnist snarked on Twitter on Wednesday. “But I’m sorry, I cannot take this seriously.” I’m sorry, we should all be taking this very seriously indeed. On the same day that prominent columnists were telling people to calm down – and less than 48 hours after the leaked supreme court opinion – Republicans in Louisiana advanced a bill that would redefine personhood to begin at the moment of fertilization and make abortion a crime of murder. Yes, you read that right: the moment of fertilization. I’m sure the people involved in drafting this law have no idea about how reproduction actually works (they like controlling female bodies, not learning about them), but between one-third and one-half of all fertilized eggs never fully implant. Which means someone in Louisiana needs to arrest God – he’s responsible for a hell of a lot of abortions! This incredibly broad definition of personhood also means that anyone experiencing an ectopic pregnancy (which are not viable and very dangerous) in Louisiana has only two choices: go to prison or die. And that’s not all: experts are worried that the law would criminalize in vitro fertilization as well as some forms of birth control. There’s a reason I brought God up just now. There’s supposed to be a division between church and state in the US but the people who drafted the Louisiana law seemingly forgot about that. The proposal contains a line about “the sanctity of innocent human life, created in the image of God”. This is clearly unconstitutional– – but that doesn’t bother the bill’s creators who have made it very clear that they don’t care about democratic norms. Indeed, the bill’s text states that the state should enforce the law “without regard to the opinions and judgments of the Supreme Court of the United States” on abortion. It’s unclear whether the Louisiana bill will become law anytime soon. But what is clear is that we are going to see more and more extreme proposals like this. As I discussed in a previous Week in Patriarchy, radicalized Christian nationalism is a growing threat in the US; a small but very organised group of people are intent on turning the country into a modern theocracy. A few years ago a researcher called Frederick Clarkson exposed a Christian supremacist initiative called Project Blitz, whose mission is undermining the separation of church and state. You know what one major component of their strategy is? Flooding state legislatures with so many bills that trying to fight them becomes a game of “Whac-A-Mole”. And as liberals are busy playing Whac-A-Mole with proposals like this Louisiana bill, extremists and evangelicals are busy consolidating power. So don’t let anyone tell you that you’re “catastrophizing”. According to Motherboard, a company called SafeGraph obtains location data from ordinary apps on people’s phones and sells it on. Planned Parenthood is classified by SafeGraph as a “brand” that can be tracked; Motherboard was able to get a week’s worth of data on where people who visited Planned Parenthood came from, and where they went afterwards for just $160. Brian Kilmeade was referencing Nina Jankowicz, who was recently appointed to lead a newly created advisory board on misinformation at the Department of Homeland Security. She is eight months pregnant. Kilmeade, by the way, is a father of three. For some reason he doesn’t seem to think that becoming a father had any impact on his ability to do his job. (Then again, a racist potato could do his job, so that’s not saying much.) Thursday marked Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons Awareness Day in the US and Red Dress Day in Canada. As CNN reports: “Nationally, there were 764 unresolved cases of missing Native American people as of March 2022, according to data from the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System. But advocates and experts have said those figures do not reflect the full extent of the issue due to the lack of comprehensive data.” About 80% of women surveyed said their workplaces have no policies or help in place; 41% said menopause symptoms were treated as a joke by colleagues; 45% said they avoid speaking to their doctor due to stigma.

5/7/2022,"The number of male secondary school teachers in England has fallen to its lowest proportion on record, according to new research that also highlights an alarming lack of senior teaching staff from ethnic minorities. An erosion in teachers’ pay has had “serious implications” for the recruitment and retention of staff, as well as the overall composition of the profession. The study found that men now make up just 35% of secondary school teachers. There were also revelations about the lack of minority ethnic teachers in senior posts in both secondary and primary schools. Almost nine in 10 English state-funded schools (87.8%) do not have a minority ethnic teacher in their senior leadership team. The figures come from an early analysis of data by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex, which is examining the pay and conditions of teaching. It found that teachers’ wages have fallen by more than 9% in real terms over the past decade, with recent evidence suggesting that three in 10 classroom teachers would be financially better off if they left the profession. Researchers suggested that men may have tended to be more mobile in the workforce and more responsive to wage levels, meaning the erosion of wages has caused a fall in the proportion of male teachers in secondary schools. The decline in the numbers has been driven by the most experienced teachers leaving. The ISER found that while the number of teachers from a minority ethnic background is increasing each year, the pace of the increase is slow. About 60% of state-funded schools do not have a single minority ethnic classroom teacher. The issue is particularly acute in the north-east and south-west, where 81% and 80% of schools respectively do not have any minority ethnic teachers. Joshua Fullard, one of the authors of the study, described the underrepresentation of people from ethnic minorities as the “most striking and unexpected” element of the research. “The pool of potential teachers – typically university graduates – is increasingly more diverse, so we’d expect more ethnic minority teachers,” he said. “But we don’t really observe that. The causes are hard to identify. The fact that teaching isn’t particularly attractive won’t be helping. Representation may also be an issue. If the workforce is predominantly white and female, people may think, ‘There aren’t people with my background in this profession’.” Fullard called for teaching to be made more attractive by increasing pay and removing tuition fees for university-led teacher training routes. The ISER study also contained a plea for official research to be commissioned examining the potential barriers preventing minority ethnic groups from entering teaching or progressing to senior leadership roles in schools. Problems of recruitment and retention are persistent in England. More than 30,000 classroom teachers leave the profession each year, while fewer people sign up for teacher training programmes than are needed to replace them. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, the biggest secondary school headteachers’ union, said the uplifting work that teachers did was being overlooked because of falling salaries and added pressures. “It is hard to pinpoint why fewer men might be joining the profession and why more people from minority ethnic backgrounds are not doing so,” he said. “However, it would certainly help a great deal if more was done to make teaching an attractive career to people of all backgrounds – by improving salaries, ensuring schools and colleges are properly funded, and ratcheting down the pressure on them. “The government is planning to improve starting salaries to £30,000 but it is simultaneously proposing to give below-inflation pay awards to more senior staff, which will make retention more difficult and potentially exacerbate teacher shortages.” Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, pointed out that one in seven teachers gave up within a year. “I think we’ve got to the point now where you have to really, really want to be a teacher and nothing else in order to train,” she said. “Most other professions aren’t like that. As for ethnic minority teachers, the education system is not divorced from the rest of society. When you talk to black teachers, they say there is stereotyping going on. For example, they’re put in charge of behaviour, but not of literacy. Their voices aren’t properly heard in the school.” The Department for Education said: “The teaching workforce is becoming more diverse – with the latest data showing 9.3% of teachers reported being from an ethnic minority background, while 21% of postgraduate teacher trainees reported the same. This is compared with 14% of people in the general population, but we know there is further to go. “We have put in place inclusive recruitment campaigns, tax-free bursaries and scholarships to encourage talented trainees from all backgrounds to teach key subjects, and removed barriers to initial teacher training to encourage applicants from diverse backgrounds. Our 500,000 training programmes for teachers at all levels of the profession will also help retain and develop the best teachers, regardless of their background.”",News/Education,Number of male teachers in England at all-time low as pay levels drop,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/07/number-of-male-teachers-in-england-at-all-time-low-as-pay-levels-drop
5/7/2022,"Matthew Roberts, 44, is an English teacher at the Green School for Boys, a state secondary in Hounslow. But for the past few years he has agonised over whether he should quit – and, in 2019, wrote and performed a one-man play called Teach at the Edinburgh fringe. Each evening, he opened up about the bullying, the pressure, the stress and the disillusionment teachers feel – and then asked the audience whether he should quit. Most of the time, he found the audience desperately wanted him to stay in teaching. And that, he says, has given him the strength to carry on. But he understands exactly why many teachers choose to leave. “Number one is the lack of agency and the systematic nature of the performance management. It’s very narrow,” he says. He can only afford to rent a one-bed flat in London, and until he was in his early 40s he lived in a house-share. “This is supposedly professional pay. But I shop at Poundland and Lidl.” There is no way he could manage to support a family on his salary or buy a family home in London, and he can easily understand why men who have started a family decide to quit. “I have friends who are teachers up north who are downsizing their house because they’ve got three children and they can’t afford their heating bill.” Teachers, like NHS workers, deserve a pay rise for their work during pandemic, he says. “We were at the coalface.” But it’s not just about pay and conditions. He thinks another reason men are leaving the profession in droves, following the pandemic, is to see the world and have adventures. “Getting Covid throws your life into focus. If you haven’t seen a world beyond the classroom, and you’re showing it to people on Powerpoint, you feel a call to the wild.” The lack of support teachers get is another big problem. He has changed schools several times in the past two decades and has nothing but praise for his current colleagues, but says: “If you feel like you’re being bullied or harassed – if you’re in a toxic environment, or you feel like you’re not being valued – that kind of pressure can break you.” He admits that even though he gets a lot of job satisfaction out of his work as a teacher, if he could afford to resign and work full-time as a playwright, he would. Instead, he is living very frugally and saving up to do a PhD. “I feel very grateful that I’ve got an income, in these times.” He contracted long Covid earlier this year – he now has tinnitus and severe hearing loss – but is back in the classroom, teaching Macbeth to teenagers and doing his best to get through each day. Despite all his reservations about teaching, his motivation for carrying on is straightforward: “It’s about giving back.”",News/Education,Why teachers quit: ‘I have friends up north who can’t afford their heating bill’,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/07/why-teachers-quit-i-have-friends-up-north-who-cant-afford-their-heating-bill
