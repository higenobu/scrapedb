2/28/2022,"This was meant to be the second-tier season to beat them all in Germany, and not just in a domestic context. Schalke and Werder Bremen filling the relegation places in May 2021 meant they joined Hamburg, Hannover, Fortuna Düsseldorf and Nürnberg in Bundesliga 2, before we even get to names such as St Pauli and Dynamo Dresden. This weekend, Werder won a five-goal thriller at Hamburg in the Nordderby to stay top of the table. After a turbulent season which has included the departure of coach Markus Anfang after a federal investigation into him faking a vaccination certificate (for which he was eventually fined and banned by the DFB), Werder won’t be counting any chickens just yet. Whether they return to the top tier or not, it seems as if next season’s Bundesliga 2 will be even more laden with big names than the present one. We are in for a layered and intense relegation battle, with all of the bottom six in the mix and some big names in serious trouble. The most desperate battle of the weekend was between direct competitors, Borussia Mönchengladbach and Wolfsburg, two clubs for whom the drop would be potentially ruinous. The contest swayed one way and then the other, like a drunk feeling for the edge of the bar for support. Gladbach flirted with costly failure, going 2-0 down in just over half an hour and then, after a vastly improved second-half showing, thought they had a winner when Matthias Ginter smashed the ball home in front of the Nord Kurve before referee Tobias Reichel and team cut the celebrations short, with Patrick Hermann penalised for an earlier foul on Jérôme Roussillon. There were reasons for optimism all round with the way it ended – Florian Kohfeldt, buoyed by his team holding on after Maxence Lacroix’s red card, spoke of “a deserved, important point”, while Gladbach fed off coming from behind and from Marcus Thuram’s first goal of a hitherto very difficult season. Yet for all the what-could-have-beens, both sides knew a point doesn’t give them more than a smidgeon of breathing space – and that they were both, at various points, close to a damaging defeat. FridayHoffenheim 2-1 Stuttgart SaturdayBayer Leverkusen 3-0 Arminia BielefeldBorussia M'gladbach 2-2 WolfsburgEintracht Frankfurt 0-1 Bayern MunichFreiburg 3-0 Hertha BerlinGreuther Furth 1-1 1 CologneUnion Berlin 3-1 Mainz SundayAugsburg 1-1 Borussia DortmundVfL Bochum 0-1 RB Leipzig They also know that they are lucky to not be Hertha, who were beaten soundly at Freiburg, a less well-resourced reminder of what can be done with stability and competent planning. For the second successive week coach Tayfun Korkut talked of the result “not reflecting the game”, following the 6-1 home beating by Leipzig. After the late goal by Augsburg’s Noah Sarenren Bazee earned his team a point against Borussia Dortmund on Sunday, the Berliners are in the relegation playoff place. One of the few bright spots was the performance of 20-year-old debutant goalkeeper Marcel Lotka, with Korkut “very happy” with his performance – but Kicker reported on Monday that the Poland under-21 international is set to join Borussia Dortmund on the expiration of his contract this summer. Despite Hertha being yet to win in 2022, Korkut appears to be safe until the end of the season at least, with head of sport Fredi Bobic backing him and turning focus on to the players who have “great contracts”, as he told Sport 1’s Doppelpass on Sunday. “Now,” continued Bobic, “they have to be held accountable.” Even worse off are Stuttgart, whose heartbreaking late loss at Hoffenheim on Friday night – after a Wataru Endo opener they led until the 85th minute, upon which they conceded twice to Christoph Baumgartner – made it nine games without a win and left them in increasing danger of what would be a third relegation in seven years. Like his counterpart Korkut, Pellegrino Matarazzo defended his players. “We played well, were 1-0 up and went home empty-handed,” said Materazzo. “This is extremely difficult to take.” While Hertha can’t complain of a lack of resources, Stuttgart have had to deal with a series of personnel issues, adding to their longstanding boardroom wranglings. Gregor Kobel and Nicolás González left for combined fees of over €40m in the summer, and a young team has been further decimated by injuries to key players. Silas Katompa Mvumpa didn’t return from an ACL injury until November and having showed flashes of his old form recently, he badly dislocated his shoulder against Bochum last week – following surgery, he will miss the rest of the season. Having scored 16 times last season, frequent injury niggles have limited man-mountain striker Sasa Kalajdzic to just four Bundesliga starts. His flick for Endo’s goal underlined what an important attacking conduit he is. Materazzo and company face Gladbach next in Saturday’s Top-Spiel. “It’s time we rewarded ourselves,” said the coach defiantly but, with only 10 games left, it feels like next season’s second tier will be even more of a battle royale than this edition, come what may in both divisions’ closing weeks.  The fallout continues in Dortmund after the embarrassing Europa League elimination to Rangers, with spirits hardly lifted by the concession of that equaliser at Augsburg on Sunday after Thorgan Hazard’s stylish opener – meaning the gap with Bayern Munich at the top widened to eight points. It was less the result in Bavaria – “the lads got the most out of what was in the tank today, said Marco Rose, with some justification after Thursday night’s exertions in Glasgow – but the sense of deja vu that nagged, with little left to play for and already the sense that sporting director-to-be Sebastian Kehl has a big job on his hands, which might include showing the door to his former teammates and club totems Marco Reus and Mats Hummels if a report in Saturday’s Bild is to be believed.  Bayern won by a single Leroy Sané goal at Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday evening, in which they were improved – if still imperfect – defensively, but the question of the future hangs over the champions too, with Robert Lewandowski, Manuel Neuer and Thomas Müller having contract issues to be addressed. Sporting director Hasan Salihamdzic told Sky that losing Lewandowski was “out of the question”, though the Poland striker (who wore an armband in the colours of Ukraine’s flag on the day his country said they would refuse to play Russia in the World Cup qualifying play-off) later replied it was “the first I’ve heard of it”.  As well as Lewandowski’s armband, there were a series of other gestures in support of Ukraine across the Bundesliga weekend starting at Hoffenheim on Friday night, while Schalke announced on Monday morning that they would “end the club’s partnership with Gazprom prematurely”, having already removed the Russian state-owned energy company’s name from the shirts before the weekend draw at Karlsruhe. Meanwhile Köln’s board and a group of supporters spent Monday’s day of Karneval at a peace demonstration in the city’s Chlodwigplatz.  Leipzig are still in the fourth Champions League place thanks to Christopher Nkunku’s clinically taken late winner at Bochum – a game in which the home side caused a series of problems for Domenico Tedesco’s team – and with wins for Freiburg and Hoffenheim too, positions four, five and six are all on 40 points, with Union Berlin just three behind after a 3-1 win over Mainz, ending their dodgy post-Max Kruse run and garlanded by Sheraldo Becker’s curling beauty from range.",Sport/Football,Bundesliga set for a relegation battle royale between some of its biggest clubs | Andy Brassell,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/28/bundesliga-set-for-a-relegation-battle-royale-between-some-of-its-biggest-clubs
2/28/2022,"A Ukrainian woman and her 15-year-old diabetic daughter say they are feeling increasingly distraught after escaping the conflict in Ukraine only to be blocked from a visa the UK government announced on Sunday evening for which they are eligible. Yakiv Voloshchuk, 60, a British citizen, rescued his wife, Oksana Voloshchuk, 41 and their daughter, Veronika Voloshchuk, from Poland on 26 February. He drove from his home in London to the Polish border and waited for them to get across Ukraine’s border with Poland. He then did a return 24-hour journey by road across Europe before reaching Paris on Sunday where he hoped he would get the green light from British officials to bring his wife and daughter on the last leg of the journey to the UK. The family hoped it would be straightforward to reach the UK, especially after the publication of new Home Office guidance giving permission for some immediate family members of British citizens to apply free of charge to join their loved ones in the UK. But when Oksana and Veronika tried to apply for the new visa online they were blocked from proceeding unless they paid thousands of pounds, even though the application is supposed to be free. “We just don’t know what to do,” Voloshchuk told the Guardian on Monday morning. “My wife’s bank account in Ukraine is frozen. We have booked into a hotel in Paris for a couple of days but I want to bring my family back to the UK to my home in London. We are getting very worried about my daughter because she is type 1 diabetic and is running out of insulin. We also don’t have a lot of money for food. She needs to eat regularly. “We went to Calais yesterday to try to cross to UK but we were refused permission and told to go to the visa centre in Paris. But when we tried to apply online the application says we need to pay £2,200 each and medical charges. The embassy is saying they can’t help. I am very worried about my daughter and I don’t understand why we have not been allowed to reach the UK.” Nataliya Rumyantseva who is also in Paris with her mother who crossed the border from Ukraine to Hungary and then flew to Paris in the hope of reaching the UK, is also struggling with the system. Unlike the Voloshchuks, her mother, Valentyna Klymova, does not qualify for the free visa under the new rules announced by the government on Sunday evening. Both families have been sent to various different places across Paris on Monday – from the UK’s visa processing centre, to the British embassy, then to the British consulate. They have now been told they need to go to another place where the UK visa team is located. All say they are completely exhausted from their journeys and are struggling with bureaucracy at a time when they are traumatised by war in Ukraine. “I’m feeling so helpless,” said Rumyantseva. “We know the source of all our problems is what Russia has done but dealing with all of this as well makes us feel like we are in a psychological pressure chamber.” The Home Office has been approached for comment.",News/World news,Ukrainians denied entry to UK despite being eligible for visa ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/ukrainians-denied-entry-to-uk-despite-being-eligible-for-visa
2/28/2022,"Sweet, salty, sour and hot: the tantalising flavour of nuoc cham, a classic Vietnamese salad dressing, is an example of how the whole can be greater than the sum of its parts. In this instance, hot chillies, fresh lime, fish sauce and sugar create a flavour combination that is hard to match. I love it on any type of salad, but douse it over a pan-fried pork chop and it really does transport you to a sizzling street food stand in Hanoi. A little pork goes a long way here, so I use two chops to feed four. If you can’t get hold of mooli, try shredded white cabbage or julienned turnip instead.Prep 20 minMarinate 30 minCook 10 minServes 4 2 large pork chops, free-range for preference1 shallot, peeled and roughly chopped3 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped2 lemongrass stalks, tender bottom part only, outer leaves discarded, roughly chopped3 tbsp palm sugar, or demerara sugar1 tsp peppercornsCoarse salt1 tbsp olive oil For the nuoc cham2 tbsp caster sugar2 Thai bird’s eye chillies, finely chopped2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushedJuice of 2 limes2 tbsp fish sauce For the salad2 large carrots, peeled1 large mooli, peeled2 big handfuls radishes1 small bunch corianderSticky rice, to serve Remove the bone from the chops and bash the meat to flatten.

Stir in the oil, pour into a sealable bag or shallow dish, then add the pork chops and rub in the dressing. Leave at room temperature to marinate for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, make the nuoc cham. Dissolve the sugar in three tablespoons of boiling water, then mix in all the other ingredients. Taste and adjust the seasoning, adding more sugar, fish sauce or lime as you see fit. Using a julienne peeler, or the julienne blade on a food processor, shred the carrots and mooli for the salad, and put in a large bowl. Using a sharp knife, finely slice the radishes and roughly chop the coriander, add to the bowl and toss to combine. Put a griddle pan on a high heat and, once it’s smoking hot, brush with a little oil, lay in the chops and grill, turning frequently to prevent burning and basting with any leftover marinade, for five to seven minutes (I like my pork so that it’s very slightly pink and still juicy, but cook to your liking). Leave the meat to rest for five to 10 minutes, then slice finely. Dress the salad with half the nuoc cham dressing, then top with the pork. Serve with sticky rice and the rest of the nuoc cham for spooning over. For a vegetarian take, substitute the fish sauce for soy, and fry some celeriac steaks instead of the pork chops.

2/28/2022,"The Republican congresswoman Lauren Boebert was condemned for comparing the Russian invasion of Ukraine to the clearing of a truckers’ protest in Ottawa, saying: “We also have neighbors to the north who need freedom and who need to be liberated.” A former US ambassador to Canada called the comments “reckless” and “dangerous”. A protest in imitation of the Canadian truckers has been making its away across the US. It is expected in Washington this week. Anthony Housefather, a Liberal member of the Canadian parliament, told Boebert that “while it’s good that you are not following the Trump line and are standing with Ukraine instead of Putin, it is sad to hear you compare free and democratic Canada to the invasion of Ukraine. “If you would like to learn about Canada please reach out.” That seems unlikely. Boebert, from Colorado, is a far-right controversialist and conspiracy theorist who since being elected in 2018 has consistently sought attention through confrontation. She was discussing the Ukraine invasion at CPAC, the conservative event in Florida, in an interview with Fox Nation hosts Pete Hegseth and Kayleigh McEnany, the latter a former White House press secretary under Donald Trump. Trump has condemned the invasion but repeatedly praised Putin. Boebert said: “I pray for Ukraine and I wish them the best.” She also praised the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, whose response to an evacuation offer was widely reported. “They have a great president right now who really said, clearly, ‘Live free or die’,” Boebert said, reaching for the New Hampshire state motto before paraphrasing Zelenskiy, saying: “I don’t need a ride, give me ammunition. The fight is right here.” She continued, saying: “But we also have neighbors to the north who need freedom and you need to be liberated and we need that right here at home.” It was a reference to the “Freedom Convoy”, a truckers’ protest which choked downtown Ottawa this month. The protest began against vaccine mandates but morphed into a protest against the government of Justin Trudeau. The prime minister used emergency powers to aid the effort to end the protest, which saw police and protesters clash in the snowy streets of the Canadian capital. Many in Canada and the US reacted to Boebert’s comments with anger. Bruce Heyman, who was US ambassador to Canada under Barack Obama, said the congresswoman’s remarks were “reckless, dangerous and [crossed] every line of diplomacy and decency. Boebert would have been expelled from the Republican party before Trump but [is] now the darling of CPAC. “Canada is our best friend, best trading partner, closest ally and should be treated as such.”",News/US news,Republican Lauren Boebert compares Ukraine to Canadian truckers’ convoy,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/28/republican-lauren-boebert-russian-invasion-ukraine-canada
2/28/2022,"The Russian-Israeli billionaire Roman Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea football club, is reportedly mediating over the Russian invasion of Ukraine, although his spokesperson has acknowledged he would have “limited” influence. The move comes amid pressure from campaigners and MPs for Abramovich to be targeted by western sanctions. He made his first public comment since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, via his Chelsea spokesperson, to claim his help had been requested. “I can confirm that Roman Abramovich was contacted by the Ukrainian side for support in achieving a peaceful resolution, and that he has been trying to help ever since,” his spokesperson said. “Considering what is at stake, we would ask for your understanding as to why we have not commented on neither the situation as such nor his involvement.” The request for his intervention came from the Ukrainian film producer Alexander Rodnyansky. No further details about his role, if any, have been given. Abramovich has passed the stewardship of Chelsea to the trustees of the club’s charitable foundation, although he remains the owner. Provided he is not sanctioned, he can continue to fund the club. He has disputed reports of his alleged close relationship with Vladimir Putin and denied there is any merit to sanctions being imposed against him. Last week the Labour MP Chris Bryant used parliamentary privilege to say that Abramovich was identified by the Home Office in 2019 as having links to the Russian state as well as to “corrupt activity and practices”. Quoting from a leaked Home Office document, Bryant said the UK should seize Abramovich’s assets and bar him from owning Chelsea. The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has claimed the UK has a “hit list” of Russian oligarchs who will face sanctions over the coming weeks, and said there would be “a rolling programme of sanctions” once the cases against individuals were legally watertight. “We are targeting oligarchs’ private jets, we’ll be targeting their properties, we’ll be targeting other possessions that they have,” she told Sky’s Trevor Phillips on Sunday. “There will be nowhere to hide.” Truss also said the government would be bringing forward its long-awaited economic crime bill this week to make it easier for assets to be targeted, by enforcing more transparency about ownership. So far only eight Russian oligarchs have been identified as being subject to individual UK sanctions but officials are understood to be examining more than 100 individuals as potential targets, with more names expected to be released in the coming days.",News/World news,Chelsea’s Abramovich ‘trying to help’ in Ukraine-Russia conflict,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/chelseas-roman-abramovich-trying-to-help-in-ukraine-russia-conflict
2/28/2022,"UK petrol and diesel prices have passed the “grim milestone” of 150p a litre for the first time, with further rises expected as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine pushes up the cost of fuel worldwide. The average price of unleaded petrol climbed to 151.25p and diesel rose to 154.74p on Sunday, both record highs, according to RAC data from roughly 7,500 UK petrol forecourts. The jump in fuel prices will add to the burden on the UK public who are already struggling with a cost of living crisis, with inflation at 5.5% in January – its highest rate for almost 30 years. “It’s truly a grim milestone that no one ever wanted to see,” Simon Williams, the RAC’s fuel spokesperson, said. “This is really going to hurt household budgets.” Williams warned that fuel costs were likely to increase and could even sail above 160p a litre in the coming weeks – worsening the impact on British living costs. He said this would make the cost of a full tank of petrol for a 55-litre family car £83 and diesel £85. Luke Bosdet, the AA’s fuel price spokeperson, said: “Petrol at [above] 150p a litre reaches a milestone that millions of motorists faced with a cost of living crisis have dreaded. It comes as households are getting notices of domestic energy price rises in April. To think that less than two years ago fuel at £1 a litre beckoned.” The latest figures are a jump from petrol’s 149.67p and diesel’s 153.05p on Thursday, both record highs at the time. “Despite the wholesale market calming slightly at the end of last week as oil fell back under $100, prices at the pump will continue to go up as retailers buy in new stock at much higher prices,” Williams added. Russia is the world’s second-largest crude oil exporter behind Saudi Arabia and there are fears Vladimir Putin could respond to western sanctions by restricting supplies. “We must now wean ourselves off dependence on Putin’s oil and gas,” Boris Johnson told the Munich security conference last weekend. However, the prime minister said it would be “the work of the months and years to come”. Johnson imposed a package of sanctions on Russia last week – following Germany’s cancellation of the planned Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline – and Putin has begun responding. Conservative MP Robert Halfon said fuel was now “genuinely going to be unaffordable for most families”, adding: “It isn’t just for motorists, it’s businesses too because they can’t afford transportation costs and this has a huge knock-on impact in terms of prices.” Halfon urged the government to take action by cutting VAT or fuel duty, arguing it would be relatively affordable “because they are raking it in at the moment given the prices of petrol”. BP on Sunday announced it was exiting its £10.4bn stake in Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft, citing a “fundamental change” in relations with Moscow and responding to pressure from the UK government. Prices for Brent crude oil – the international benchmark – surged 4.8% to $102.67 a barrel on Monday. The Bank of England expects the UK cost of living crisis to deepen, forecasting the consumer prices index will rise above 7% by the spring.

The initiative, called “In Lazio with love”, is open to Italians and foreigners who marry or have a civil union in the region between 1 January and 31 December 2022. Couples can make their requests, providing a maximum of five receipts, from Monday and, if accepted, will receive a €2,000 refund on money spent on Lazio-based wedding services, including wedding planners, wedding attire, venues, catering, flowers, car hire and photographers. The region has set aside a total €10m for the initiative, and applications for the refund can be made up until the end of January 2023, or until the fund runs out. “The scheme is needed to support a sector that has suffered badly from the economic crisis,” said Nicola Zingaretti, the president of Lazio. “We have put the significant investment in place also with an eye on the tourism sector, and with the awareness and pride of being able to boast about every part of our region, with many locations among the most magical and fascinating in the world thanks to an unparalleled cultural heritage.” Since the start of the pandemic, 9,000 couples have wed in Lazio, compared with more than 15,000 in 2019.

2/28/2022,"When you hear people conversing in an unfamiliar language, why is it that you can’t even tell where one word ends and the next begins? If you are a native English speaker, why is it so challenging to get your mouth around a French or Hebrew “r”, which originates lower in the throat, or the “r” in Spanish or Italian, which is trilled on the tip of the tongue? Your ability to hear and make sounds, and to understand their meaning as language, is wired into your brain. How you acquire that wiring illuminates an age-old debate about human nature. In the first few months of your life, your infant brain is bathed in all kinds of information from the world around you, through your senses. This sense data causes changes in your brain as your neurons fire in various patterns. Some collections of neurons fire together frequently, strengthening or tuning their connections and aiding learning. Others are used less and are pruned away, making room for more useful ones to form. This process of tuning and pruning is called plasticity, and it happens throughout your life, but enormously in the first few years. One of the biggest sources of sense data for an infant brain is other people. As a consequence, your infant brain was tuned and pruned to detect fine differences in human speech, including a large inventory of consonant and vowel sounds, becoming expert in distinguishing one from another. But here’s the thing ​– ​babies tend to spend time with caregivers who speak the same language, so you probably missed out on many sounds found only in other languages. That’s one reason you may find it hard to produce or even discern these unfamiliar sounds today. This brings us to the age-old debate I mentioned: are your deepest characteristics and abilities present at birth, or are they formed by your experiences in the world? In other words, is nature or nurture the prime mover? We know that part of who you are comes from genes, which contain instructions to build your body and wire your brain. We also know that the culture you grow up in can shape your brain and body in fundamental ways. Few scientists today would say that 100% of your attributes are inborn or are learned; the debate tends to be about where to draw the dividing line. Newer evidence, however, suggests that the dividing line doesn’t really exist. Your environment, it turns out, causes certain genes to turn on and off, a process called epigenetics. You also have genes that regulate how much the environment affects you. Genes and environment are ​so deeply entwined, like lovers in a fiery tango, that it’s fundamentally unhelpful to call them separate names like “nature” and “nurture”. Take the idea of sleeping on a piece of furniture called a bed, by yourself or with a partner, in a designated room called a “bedroom”, for a long chunk of time like eight hours. Such ideas are actually wired into your brain by experience and guide your expectations and actions. You can tell because it feels somehow “wrong” to change the habit. If you and your whole family all slept on straw mats in one room every night, and you had to wake up every two hours to tend the fire, it would feel unnatural to you, despite the fact that other cultures live this way. Even emotions such as joy, sadness and fear, which feel inborn and automatic, are in fact a product of culture. Suppose you see someone make a wide-eyed, gasping face. If you grew up in a western society, you are likely to perceive fear in that face, but if you grew up in Melanesia, you’re more likely to perceive threat and aggression. Culture allows one generation to pass information on to the next without it having to be carried by genes. Your childhood caregivers curated your physical and social world, and your brain wired itself to that world. You perpetuate that world and eventually pass your culture on to the following generation through your words and actions, wiring their brains in turn. This cultural inheritance is an efficient, flexible partner to genetic inheritance, and means that the process of evolution doesn’t require all our wiring instructions to be in genes. The way your brain becomes tuned to the languages you hear as a baby is just one example. Similarly, if you’re exposed to adversity in early life, it may activate certain genes and suppress others, wiring your brain to deal with adversity that may arise in the future. Unfortunately, this wiring also makes you more vulnerable to depression, anxiety, heart disease and diabetes in adulthood. If you have children, you might pass some of these characteristics on to them through epigenetic changes. Cultural practices even shape the genetic evolution of our entire species, by influencing who is available to reproduce with whom, and which children are more likely to live to reproductive age. Wealth, social class, laws, war and other human inventions empower one group over another, changing the odds on whether certain people will have children together, or at all. Political and religious polarisation ensures that people with different beliefs will scarcely speak to one another, let alone date or mate. Parents who vaccinate their children against deadly diseases, or choose not to, likewise make waves in the gene pool. This is how humans, by virtue of the cultures we create, nudge the evolutionary trajectory of our species. Culture is not a mere moderator of our biology, then, but a fully fledged cause. I’m not saying that your culture determines your destiny, but then neither do your genes. Together, your genes and the world you live in make you who you are (for better or for worse). We are therefore all partly responsible for wiring each other’s brains, and the brains of the next generation, through our words and actions. That’s the lesson of the latest science: there need be no “versus” in the equation. We simply have the kind of nature that requires nurture, and they are utterly intertwined.
