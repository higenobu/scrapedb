1/26/2022,"A Colorado sheriff’s deputy retired with a $30,000 separation agreement instead of facing an internal investigation over an OnlyFans page she owns. ""I was a really good cop. I was a really good cop and I was a really good leader,"" Melissa Williams, 48, told KDVR's Problem Solvers team. Williams was in law enforcement for 28 years, spending the last 11 years with the Arapahoe County Sheriff’s Office and most recently served as a lieutenant at a detention center. RACHEL DOLEZAL LAUNCHES ONLYFANS FOR 'FOOT PICS' AND 'SQUATS' She had the OnlyFans account for 18 months without any problems, but then coworkers found out and a female officer in a nearby police department filed a complaint, KDVR reported. ""I think some people viewed as what I did for fun, as being a sex worker, but I’m the same as someone else’s neighbor, their friend, mom, daughter. I’m still the same person I was for the 18 months the page existed and nobody knew,"" Williams said. She still operates the OnlyFans page, where subscribers pay a monthly fee to see Williams nude or watch her sexual encounters with her husband. Williams said she posted the content when she was off-duty, was never in uniform in the content she posted and never identified herself as a law enforcement officer. ONLYFANS REVERSES COURSE IN ALLOWING SEXUALLY EXPLICIT CONTENT ""A lot of the material my husband and I shared is stuff we’d taken in our private sex life over the years,"" Williams, a mother of two, said according to the New York Post. ""I was working up to 60-hour weeks, so mostly my husband ran the page and shared my pictures, and then sometimes we’d have fun dressing me up and taking photos especially to share."" The complaint was filed on Aug. 5, describing that Williams’ ""poor judgment was a discredit to the Arapahoe County Sheriff’s Office."" ""I was like, this doesn’t even affect the person that reported it. It doesn’t affect my work, it doesn’t affect my employees, it doesn’t affect the community,"" Williams said. The sheriff’s office investigated the complaint and internal documents obtained by KDVR said, ""The website contained pictures of Lt. Williams posing for pictures clearly showing her face and her genitals, one or more of the photos appear to have been taken in a very public location."" SHANNA MOAKLER LAUNCHES ONLYFANS ACCOUNT A spokesman for the sheriff told KDVR that Williams should have gotten permission for the secondary job, but Williams pushed back that it did not occur to her to ask for permission. ""No, because it really doesn’t generate employment income and there are a lot of individuals throughout the metro area who have what could be considered secondary employment but it isn’t something that gets claimed or gets reported,"" she said. She pulls in about $4,000 a month from the account, according to the New York Post. She took the $30,000 separation and release agreement in November, retiring from the force partly because she believes she would have been fired if she didn’t. ""I did not leave out of shame and I did not leave out of embarrassment for the OnlyFans page. I left because it was the right thing for myself and my family, and honestly, the OnlyFans piece was just one part of it,"" Williams said, according to KDVR. ""I loved my job — but how could I go back to work in an environment like that?"" said Williams, the New York Post reported. ""It was hard being a woman in the force. People have always been jealous of me because I am successful, attractive and confident."" The Arapahoe County Sheriff’s Office said in a comment to KDVR that Williams was not fired or forced out, and that she ""sought to negotiate a severance and elected to resign her employment"" before the investigation was completed. ""Ms. Williams was not fired, nor was she forced to leave the Arapahoe County Sheriff’s Office. Ms. Williams’ allegations appear to be nothing more than an effort to manufacture a ‘newsworthy’ story to drive traffic to her website,"" the sheriff’s office said.",U.S./Fox News,Colorado deputy with OnlyFans account retires after being discovered by female officer,https://news.yahoo.com/colorado-deputy-onlyfans-account-retires-142523181.html
1/26/2022,"By Andrius Sytas VILNIUS (Reuters) - Lithuanian officials, seeking to defuse a row with China, are discussing whether to ask their Taiwanese counterparts to modify the Chinese translation of the name of Taiwan's de-facto embassy in Vilnius, two sources told Reuters. The self-ruled island that China views as part of its territory has other offices in Europe and the United States but they use the name of the city Taipei, avoiding reference to the island itself. The row erupted after the Baltic state allowed the opening of the Taiwanese Representation office in Vilnius. China has downgraded its diplomatic relationship with Lithuania and pressed multinationals to sever ties with the country or face exclusion from its market. That is an unusually harsh move that has dragged companies into a political dispute and placed Beijing on a collision course with the European Union. Modifying the Chinese version of the representation name to refer to ""Taiwanese people"" rather than to Taiwan, was last week proposed by Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis to President Gitanas Nauseda as a way to reduce the tensions with China, sources said. The change, which would bring the name in line with those used in Lithuanian and English, would need Taiwan's agreement. The President's office refused to comment. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not reply to a request for comment. It is not possible for any single gesture by Lithuania to change China's attitude, said Linas Kojala, who heads the Vilnius Eastern European Studies Centre think-tank. ""The government probably wants to emphasise that the office represents not Taiwan as a political entity, but the Taiwanese people with whom Lithuania wants to establish cultural, economic and other relationships,"" he said. Chinese tabloid newspaper the Global Times published an article on Saturday saying that ""it will take much more than just renaming the office"" for Lithuania to mend its relationship with China. ""Lithuania needs to make substantial adjustments to its overall China policy, rather than completely follow the US' agenda,"" said the article in The Global Times, which is published by the People's Daily, the official newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party.

1/26/2022,"The eruption of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano on January 15, which sits on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, sent tsunami waves across the Pacific Ocean and was heard some 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles) away in New Zealand. Photographs from Nomuka on Monday (January 17) and Tuesday (January 18) showed ash coating toppled building structures, and interiors of buildings ridden with debris and damage. In Tungua, boats and classrooms were captured to have weathered damage from the aftermath as well. The eruption was so powerful that space satellites captured not only huge clouds of ash but also an atmospheric shockwave that radiated out from the volcano at close to the speed of sound.",Science/Reuters Videos,Aftermath photos show devastation in Tonga islands,https://news.yahoo.com/aftermath-photos-show-devastation-tonga-101655420.html
