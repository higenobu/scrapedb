4/26/2022,"The former White House Covid response coordinator, Deborah Birx, has decried the press conference in 2020 during which, in her presence, Donald Trump floated the idea of the injection of disinfectants to treat coronavirus – calling the episode a “tragedy on many levels”. In an interview with Good Morning America, Birx said she does not regret taking on the role in Trump’s team, even though she received criticism for not standing up to his misinformed comments more forcefully at the time. Birx is promoting her new book Silent Invasion: The Untold Story of the Trump Administration, Covid-19, and Preventing the Next Pandemic Before It’s Too Late, which is released on Tuesday. When asked about how she felt during the moment Trump promoted the use of disinfectants to treat the virus, Birx said: “At the beginning, I didn’t even know what was happening.” She said scientists and Trump had a discussion prior to the press conference about a study on how light and disinfectants could help kill the virus on outer surfaces. She writes in her book that when Trump looked at her as he was talking about the subject, while she sat to the side, she had wanted to fall through the floor. “This was a tragedy on many levels,” she told GMA host George Stephanopoulos. She continued: “I didn’t realize … that scientists went into the Oval Office and they started that discussion there, and they continued it in front of America.” “This was a tragedy on many levels”: Dr. Deborah Birx recounts to @GStephanopoulos the press conference where former Pres. Trump floated the idea of injecting disinfectant to treat COVID-19. https://t.co/oI7HetPjm4 pic.twitter.com/jN5tTtpA8K Birx went on to explain that she spoke to Trump’s staff members immediately after the press conference, telling them that his statement was incorrect and had to be reversed. “Many people don’t know me, but I’m a pretty direct person, so I immediately went to his most senior staff and to Olivia Troye [a former aide to the White House coronavirus taskforce] and said: this has to be reversed. And by the next morning the president was saying this [what he had said] was a joke.” Birx was widely criticized for not flatly and emphatically contradicting Trump on the spot to the public, as he not only mused on the very dangerous concept of ingesting bleach to cure Covid, but also downplayed the virus and predicted that it would disappear. Birx also revealed that she had a “pact” with “all the doctors in the doctors’ group,” including Anthony Fauci, Robert Redfield and Stephen Hahn, all of whom were on Trump’s Covid taskforce. “It was if any one of the individuals were under so much pressure and they were fired, that we would all leave together from the taskforce,” she said, adding, “I think that was really important, because I really wanted to protect Bob Redfield and Steve Hahn and they were under enormous pressure.”",News/US news,Trump claim of disinfectant to treat Covid ‘a tragedy on many levels’ – Birx,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/25/trump-covid-disinfectant-deborah-birx-book
4/26/2022,"Nearly half the jury members who sentenced a Texas woman to death for the murder of her young child in 2007 are asking for her execution to be halted and for her to receive a new trial. Five of the 12 jurors who sentenced 52-year-old Melissa Lucio of Cameron county to death for killing her two-year-old daughter, along with one alternate jury member, have questioned their original decision and asked for a new trial, reports the Associated Press. Lucio is scheduled to be executed on 27 April for the death of her daughter, Mariah, on 17 February 2007. But Lucio’s lawyers have argued that significant evidence suggests that Lucio did not commit the crime and that her previous confession, one of the main pieces of evidence used in the trial, was coerced. “I knew that what I was accused of doing was not true,” Lucio wrote in a letter to Texas lawmakers, according to the AP. “My children have always been my world and although my choices in life were not good I would have never hurt any of my children in such a way.” Lucio’s lawyers say that new evidence shows Mariah’s injuries, such as a blow sustained to the head, were caused by the toddler falling down the stairs. Her lawyers also claim that prosecutors misled jurors hearing Lucio’s case by suggesting that Mariah’s injuries could only have been caused by physical abuse. Lucio’s lawyers also maintain that prosecutors got Lucio to confess under duress by using the controversial “Reid technique,” an interrogation method that has led to previous wrongful convictions in the US. Using the Reid method, officers got extremely close to Lucio’s face and berated her for hours, before switching to a softer tone and saying that Lucio could “put this to rest” if she confessed to killing her daughter. After almost six hours of late night interrogation, in which Lucio said she was innocent more than 100 times, Lucio finally said: “I don’t know what you want me to say,” she told them. “I’m responsible for it … I guess I did it.” Her attorneys also contend that the previous Cameron county district attorney who prosecuted Lucio’s case, Armando Villalobos, might have pushed Lucio’s conviction to support his own re-election campaign. According to the AP, Villalobos was convicted in 2014 of accepting bribes in exchange for favorable prosecutorial decisions, including minimizing sentences and dismissing cases. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison. The county’s current district attorney, Luis Saenz, has said that he disagrees with claims that new evidence will acquit Lucio. But after initially refusing to push to stop the execution under any circumstances, he said last month that he would intervene if needed. “I don’t disagree with all the scrutiny this case is getting,” Saenz said. “I welcome that.” Lucio’s attorneys have submitted several legal appeals to stop her execution. An application for her clemency is also set to be considered on Monday by the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles. Calls to stay Lucio’s execution have received rare bipartisan support from Texas state officials, with more than half the members in the Texas house and senate asking for her execution to be halted. Nationwide, protests have demanded clemency for Lucio, including a large show of support throughout Texas. Public figures including Kim Kardashian have also shared their support for Lucio via social media. Talkshow host John Oliver spotlighted Lucio’s case in an episode about wrongful convictions last month. Any decision to commute Lucio’s execution would require the approval of Texas governor Greg Abbott, who has granted clemency for only one person on death row since taking office in 2015, according to AP. Texas has executed more women than any other state, since the US supreme court brought back the death penalty in 1976, reported AP. Of the 17 women who have been executed nationwide, six have been put to death in Texas. Lucio would be the first Hispanic woman ever executed in Texas and the first woman since 2014.",News/World news,Five jury members who sentenced Texas woman to death call for new trial,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/25/melissa-lucio-new-trial-texas
4/26/2022,"Pep Guardiola has told his Manchester City players to seize what might be a “once in a lifetime” chance to knock Real Madrid out of the Champions League. City host the Spaniards in the first leg of the semi-final at the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday as they aim to reach the final for a second consecutive year. Real arrive as the record 13-time winners but Guardiola wants his team to enjoy the occasion. “We have to be so precise against them,” he said on Monday. “I said to the players: ‘Enjoy it, prepare for the game. It could be once in a lifetime [experience], nobody knows.’ There is no sense to not enjoy it, we want to be ourselves.” Guardiola believes reaching the last four again is another step in City’s quest to build an elite-level mentality and culture of relentless winning. “That’s why big clubs stay there for a long time. When you win, take a shower and go again. We are learning that. I felt that in Barcelona as a young boy and we are trying to build that culture where we have to win every game and fight to win every game.” He is conscious that City should forget Real’s pedigree and simply play Carlo Ancelotti’s side. “The history is there – we cannot change it but it’s 11 v 11,” Guardiola said. “The players will decide this. We are playing a team who have been here many times, that’s why they have this history and we don’t. We can’t imagine what is going to happen but it’s 11 v 11 so it is about how the players move, how strong they are mentally, that will make the difference. Carlo and myself won’t win it. The players will. “If we have to compete with history we don’t have any chance, they are better, it speaks for itself. But we have the desire to play against them and take on this incredible test and we want to improve. We are going to suffer together and then, when when we attack, do it as well as possible. This would be the same against Bayern Munich or Barça. They’ve been in it many times. Before the last decade we were never here. Reaching the final [last year] is a good lesson for us and for the future it will be good.” Guardiola was also asked if City reaching this stage two seasons in a row meant that they are now an elite club and so in a sense it was mission accomplished for him. “Listen, as far as I’m a manager, it will never be accomplished, I’ll have another dream or target. We try to do our best, suffer together when playing bad, hopefully as few minutes as possible. This is the motive to do my job.” This is only City’s third semi-final, their first having also been against Real in 2016 when a Gareth Bale goal took the Spanish side through 1-0 on aggregate. City knocked Real out in the last 16 two seasons ago, but this time Guardiola has concerns regarding who he can select in defence on Tuesday. João Cancelo, a first-choice full-back, is suspended while Kyle Walker, John Stones and Nathan Aké face late fitness tests. “They are doubts, John has not trained since Brighton [last Wednesday],” Guardiola said. “Kyle not trained for the last 10 days. We’ll see how they feel and I’ll speak with them and make a decision on the day.” Raheem Sterling was sitting next to Guardiola at the press conference on Monday. His 23 Champions League goals rank him as England’s third-highest scorer in the competition yet there have been discussions about his future with his contract running out next year. “At the minute I’m just happy to be playing, happy to be contributing with the team,” Sterling said. “I think that’s the most important thing. At this period, I think it would be selfish of me to speak of any contract situation – I’m happy to be playing football and see where we are at the end of the season.” Of his tally in the competition Sterling said: “It’s like anything, when you make your professional debut, then it’s on to the next thing. It’s scoring your first goal and then after scoring your first goal, as a human you always have to try and do better and that’s the case with me every season. “I try to see how I can improve and to better at all these things that come along. I was trying to see if I can get the England record [of 30] and that’s what I’ll try to do.”",Sport/Football,Guardiola says Manchester City must find pleasure in Real Madrid showdown,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/25/guardiola-says-manchester-city-must-find-pleasure-in-real-madrid-showdown
4/26/2022,"Sweden and Finland have agreed to submit simultaneous membership applications to the US-led Nato alliance as early as the middle of next month, Nordic media have reported. The Finnish daily Iltalehti said on Monday that Stockholm had “suggested the two countries indicate their willingness to join” on the same day, and that Helsinki had agreed “as long as the Swedish government has made its decision”. The Swedish newspaper Expressen cited government sources as confirming the report. The two countries’ prime ministers said this month they were deliberating the question, arguing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had changed Europe’s “whole security landscape” and “dramatically shaped mindsets” in the Nordic region. Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, said then that her country, which shares a 1,300km (810 mile) border with Russia, would decide whether to apply to join the alliance “quite fast, in weeks not months”, despite the risk of infuriating Moscow. Her Swedish counterpart, Magdalena Andersson, said Sweden had to be “prepared for all kinds of actions from Russia” and that “everything had changed” when Moscow attacked Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly warned both countries against the move. The Kremlin said it would be forced to “restore military balance” by strengthening its defences in the Baltic, including by deploying nuclear weapons, if the two countries decided to abandon decades of military nonalignment by joining Nato. Sweden’s foreign minister, Ann Linde, said last week a wide-ranging security policy review would be concluded by 13 rather than 31 May as originally planned, adding that with Finland’s analysis already published “there is now a lot of pressure”. Expressen said the simultaneous applications could be submitted in the week of 16 May, coinciding with a state visit to Stockholm by the Finnish president Sauli Niinistö. The Guardian could not independently confirm the reports. Recent opinion polls have shown as many as 68% of Finns are in favour of joining the alliance, more than double the figure before the invasion, with only 12% against. Polling in Sweden suggests a slim majority of Swedes also back membership. Both countries are officially nonaligned militarily, but became Nato partners – taking part in exercises and exchanging intelligence – after abandoning their previous stance of strict neutrality when they joined the EU in 1995 after the end of the cold war.",News/World news,"Sweden and Finland agree to submit Nato applications, say reports",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/25/sweden-and-finland-agree-to-submit-nato-applications
4/26/2022,"Whichever way you cut it – and as obvious as the observation may sound – the runoff vote that returned Emmanuel Macron to the Élysée Palace for a second term, with a score of 58.5% to Marine Le Pen’s 41.5%, showed France to be a divided country. But it’s complicated. Geographically, first. The vote for what was Jean-Marie Le Pen’s Front National and is now his daughter’s Rassemblement National (RN) has long been analysed this way, but the far-right party’s gradual normalisation has made this less salient. France’s post-vote map shows Macron broadly enjoying support in Paris, the west, south-west and centre of the country, while Le Pen won overwhelmingly in swathes of her north and north-eastern heartlands and the Mediterranean south. It’s traditional also to note that the RN does better in struggling rural and outer suburban France, and Macron duly won the big cities, scoring more than 80% in Paris, Nantes, Rennes and Bordeaux and 70%-plus in Lyon, Strasbourg, Toulouse and Lille. But the president’s vote held up pretty well in a lot of smaller towns, too, and in many parts of the countryside Le Pen – although her scores there were generally higher – only managed to draw level. It looks a more complex picture than it used to be. “The biggest divides are above all generational and social,” said Mathieu Gallard, the research director of the Ipsos France polling company. “A look at detailed commune by commune map shows the rural-urban split really does not correspond to reality.” So what were those generational divides? Again according to Ipsos’s data, the youngest voters, aged 18 to 24, voted 61% for Macron – although 41% in that age bracket did not vote at all – with the 25-34-year-olds and 35-49-year-olds following suit, but by smaller margins – 51% and 53%. The 50-somethings – perhaps the generation most alarmed by Macron’s pension plans – broke narrowly for Le Pen at 51%-49%, while the 60- and 70-pluses, with the most to lose from her economic policies, plumped 59% and 71% for Macron and turned out to vote in by far the largest numbers. “So what we have is an older France that massively supported Emmanuel Macron, and a younger France that partially turned their backs on the vote,” the political analyst Jérôme Jaffré said. “It’s a major sociological gulf.” In terms of income, the voting data broadly paints a picture of a wealthier, well-educated and contented France that voted for the incumbent, and a less well-off, less well educated and discontented France that cast its ballots for Le Pen. According to the pollsters Elabe, 59% of voters who said they were “struggling to make ends meet” voted for the far-right contender; 41% opted for Macron. Of those who said they had no financial struggles, 66% chose Macron and 34% Le Pen. Ipsos’s data on employment reflects the same broad picture: 59% of independent professionals, 77% of senior management, 59% of junior managers, teachers and healthcare workers, and 69% of pensioners voted Macron, whereas 57% of regular employees and 67% of blue-collar workers chose Le Pen. Almost 75% of voters with a degree or other higher education qualification voted for the centrist incumbent, while more than 60% of those who did not have their baccaulauréat – or secondary-school leaving exam – chose Le Pen. There was another divide: those who voted – including those who did so reluctantly – and those who, forced to choose between two candidates they disliked, did not. Turnout was just 72%, with abstentions at their highest in any second-round runoff vote in France since Georges Pompidou won in 1969. What’s more, 8.6% of those who turned up at polling stations on Sunday went to the the trouble of not casting a ballot for either candidate, with 6.35% voting “blank” – not putting a ballot paper in their envelope – and 2.25% spoiling their ballot. Taken together that means more than a third of registered voters in France – about 15 million people – did not express a choice. A 72% turnout may sound high by British or US standards, but it means Macron was elected by barely 38.5% of the electorate, and many of those who voted for him did so mainly stop the far right winning. All of this makes Macron’s second term even more challenging than his first. Often accused of being “president of the rich”, he must prioritise policies that rebuild ties with those voters who stayed away or lent him their vote solely to block Le Pen. It’s not just about policies, though. France might also be somewhat less divided if it did not have a two-round electoral system that left large parts of the population feeling wildly under-represented – as they will, again, in June’s parliamentary vote. To make it to the second round, candidate MPs must score at least 12.5%, a bar that in the last parliament saw Le Pen’s party win just eight of the national assembly’s 577 seats and Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s far-left La France Insoumise (Unbowed France) 17. That’s plainly recipe for division and conflict. Macron has promised to look into introducing more proportional representation into France’s politics, a measure that would necessarily promote compromise and consensus. Divided France’s voters need, as much as anything else, political choice.",News/World news,France divided: what does fractured vote mean for Macron’s second term?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/25/france-divided-what-does-fractured-vote-mean-for-macron-second-term
4/26/2022,"The Classic generation does not have the racing stage to itself for long, but the few weeks between the Guineas and Derby meetings, when the Newmarket Classics are followed by a fortnight of Epsom trials and the best three-year-olds rise to the top, are as good as it gets for many fans of the Flat. And this time around, it will not be just the sport’s devotees who sit up and take notice as the springtime cycle starts to turn once again. At Newmarket this weekend and at Epsom in early June in particular, there could be faces in the stands attracting far more attention – and on a global scale – than the horses and riders on the track. Racing has been counting down the days to the 2022 Derby since the announcement, on the eve of last year’s Classic, that our premier Classic would be an official part of the Queen’s platinum jubilee celebrations, with the monarch “accompanied by members of the Royal family, in attendance”. A few weeks later, in mid-July, the Queen’s homebred colt Reach For The Moon – with strong form in the Epsom Classics on both sides of his pedigree – got off the mark at the third attempt at Newbury. And five weeks after that, Reach For The Moon came home four lengths clear in the Solario Stakes at Sandown, a race that has been won by a subsequent Derby winner as recently as 2017. A narrow defeat in the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster was followed by the news that Reach For The Moon had sustained an injury on the gallops that would keep him out until 2022. He remains a general 10-1 shot for the Derby, however, and John Gosden, his trainer, recently reported him on target to go on trial for Epsom in the Dante Stakes at York on 12 May. During her 70 years as an owner on the British turf the Queen has won four of the five Classic races. She took the Oaks for the first time in 1957 with Carrozza, the 2,000 Guineas with Pall Mall a year later and the 1,000 Guineas in 1974 with Highclere, before Dunfermline landed both the Oaks and St Leger in 1977, the year of her silver jubilee. The Derby, however, has famously eluded her, most recently by just a length when Carlton House, the 5-2 favourite 11 years ago, was third behind Pour Moi. If she could simply have a runner with a chance in this year’s race, smack in the middle of the long weekend to celebrate her seven decades on the throne, it would potentially be the best advertisement for the sport of kings and queens in living memory. But a lot has changed since last year’s Derby. The monarch public appearances have steadily dwindled over the last 12 months, she contracted Covid-19 in February and has since been reported to have “mobility issues” which make it difficult for her to remain on her feet, even for quite short periods of time. As a result, speculation is rife about how publicly the Queen will be able to mark her jubilee around the first weekend in June, including attendance at the Derby. The track announced last week that a guard of honour, formed of 40 current and former jockeys who have worn the royal silks, will welcome her to the course on 4 June, while the Queen’s Stand will also be renamed as the Queen Elizabeth II Stand in her honour. The one cloud on the horizon for Epsom is a suggestion that since the 96-year-old monarch can no longer walk any significant distance without support. Prince Andrew hopes to be her “chaperone” on Derby day, as he was at March’s memorial service for Prince Philip. York racecourse decided to rename the Duke of York Stakes earlier this year, shortly after Andrew settled a civil sexual assault action brought by Virginia Giuffre, in order to ensure that the race’s title would not be “a distraction from what is a good contest”. Andrew did not admit liability but reportedly paid millions of dollars to settle and his presence, supporting his mother on Derby day, would be rather more than a distraction. It is anyone’s guess how a guest appearance by the prince might go down with a well-lubricated Epsom crowd of 100,000-plus in the middle of a bank holiday weekend, but “not too well” is definitely in the mix.

If so, it would be the first time that the ruler of Dubai has attended a British race meeting with a full crowd since a family court found in March 2020 that he had orchestrated the kidnapping of two of his daughters – including one who was abducted in broad daylight on a street in Cambridge – and later engaged in a campaign of “intimidation” against his former wife, Princess Haya. It would be the first time too since he was ordered to pay a record-breaking divorce settlement to Princess Haya last December, which included several million pounds annually to ensure the security of the Princess and the couple’s children, in the face of the “main threat” posed by her former husband. If there is any track in Britain that might offer Sheikh Mohammed a warm welcome, it is surely Newmarket, as the town and surrounding area is in his debt to the tune of billions over the last 40 years. But it draws its spectators from much further afield, and the response from the stands if Sheikh Mohammed steps on to the podium is impossible to predict.

4/26/2022,"Left and liberal pro-EU politicians have welcomed the defeat of Slovenia’s rightwing populist prime minister, Janez Janša, to a political insurgent who has pledged to restore “normality” to the central European nation. With nearly all ballots counted, political newcomer Robert Golob gained nearly 35% of the vote for his Freedom Movement launched in January. He is expected to form a government with the support of smaller leftwing groups, ending the hard-right government led by Janša, who styled himself on Hungary’s autocratic leader, Viktor Orbán, and took nearly 24% of the vote. Pro-EU politicians reacted with delight to Golob’s victory, which emerged as Emmanuel Macron beat his far-right rival, Marine Le Pen to take a second term as French president. “These results are a bloody nose for illiberals and a chance to make Europe stronger,” said Stéphane Séjourné, a Macron ally, who leads centrist MEPs in the European parliament. “The EU [and] Slovenia is better off without the rightwing populist Janez Janša, who attacked the free press [and] democratic institutions in Slovenia,” Séjourné said. The leader of the Socialist group in the European parliament, Iratxe García Pérez, said Slovenians had “chosen change” and no longer wanted the “populist and authoritarian” Janša leadership. “The Freedom Movement now has the opportunity to usher in a new era with a centre-left government that fully supports EU values,” she wrote. During Janša’s two-year government, Slovenia has experienced the sharpest democratic decline in eastern Europe and Central Asia, according to Freedom House. While the NGO noted that political rights and freedoms were “generally respected” it said Janša’s government had made “continued attempts to undermine the rule of law and democratic institutions, including the media and judiciary”. Florian Bieber at the University of Graz said it was a positive result for the EU. “Janez Janša has been a very disruptive figure, not just in Slovenia” he said. “He encouraged the idea that he could export [Orbán’s] model of government to other countries and that has certainly been defeated in Slovenia and that is encouraging, so it suggests the limits of Orbán’s appeal.” Nika Kovač, director of the 8 March Institute, an NGO that ran a voter mobilisation drive, said that on Monday “we woke up in a radically different Slovenia. It was a decision about which country we want to live in. I think people were voting not just for the party, but for the direction we need to go.” Turnout reached 70% of the 1.7 million electorate, much higher than the 52% of the previous election in 2018. Kovač said she had faced online abuse, including death threats and attacks on her appearance, from Janša supporters. The 8 March Institute that she leads is calling on the new government to pass an “omnibus law” that would repeal 11 decisions taken by the National Assembly during Janša’s term, including measures to safeguard the autonomy of police and bolster the rights of environmental campaigners in court proceedings. Janša, leader of the Slovenian Democratic party, returned to power in March 2020, after two previous stints in office. He regained power when the previous centre-left prime minister resigned, saying he did not have enough votes to pass important legislation. The rightwing populist, who used Twitter to launch ad-hominem attacks on journalists, soon ran into conflict with the EU. For much of 2021 his government withheld funds from the Slovenian Press Agency, resulting in the organisation losing 10% of its journalists. He criticised the judiciary and claimed without evidence that the constitutional court was responsible for coronavirus deaths, after judges ruled that his government’s Covid-19 legislation was incompatible with the constitution. “He was pretending he was Orbán who has an outright majority, which he [Janša] never had, so in a certain way he was overplaying his hand,” said Bieber. The political scientist added that Janša remained within the margin of his previous electoral score, so “it’s not that he lost a lot”. Janša was one of the first EU leaders to visit Kyiv after the outbreak of war, but this failed to help him at the polls, said Bieber. “There is a limit for populist nationalist conservative politics in Slovenia. That you can’t really win elections with that alone.” During the campaign Golob promised to restore “normality” and billed the elections as a “referendum on democracy”. The former energy executive, who ran a company promoting solar power, is also calling for a green energy transition. Analysts say it remains to be seen whether Golob can overcome the difficulties that have beset previous political startups on the centre-left, which have fizzled out amid infighting and organisational problems. “The problem with these kind of parties is that they don’t have apparatus, they don’t have experience, they don’t have knowledge how to run governmental policies and this after a year or two could create a lot of tensions,” said political analyst Miha Kovač, who is the father of Nika Kovač. “There is a serious danger that Slovenia will become politically unstable in a year or two,” he said. Meanwhile Janša, one of Slovenia’s longest-serving politicians, is expected to continue to lead his party. “He is irremovable, he is there for eternity,” said Miha Kovač. “He is the most experienced person in the Slovenian parliament. He will take a holiday now, I assume, and then he will wait for his chance to jump in when he sees the first sign of governmental coalition falling apart.”",News/World news,Pro-EU politicians hail defeat of Slovenia’s hard-right prime minister,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/25/pro-eu-politicians-herald-defeat-slovenia-hard-right-janez-jansa-robert-golob
4/26/2022,"Seals are the “rats of the sea” and should be culled, a group of Cornish fishers have said. Marine campaign groups hit back after fishers on an online marketplace and forum expressed anger about the amount of fish seals eat. Posting a statistic that “for every fish caught by our fisheries, seals eat 53 times more”, the Cornish Mackerel Fishermen group wrote, adding: “We need a cull!”The fishers did not supply a source for this number. Some studies have suggested seals eat as many fish as commercial fisheries catch in some areas. After backlash, the group doubled down, adding: “This page is for line fishermen, which is the most eco friendly way of fishing. Line fishermen do not support super trawlers or ring netters in any way. “There’s a real problem with the seal population around the UK as they have no predators any more? All you lot see is cute furry labrador-looking animals when in fact they are like the rats of the sea.” This description is disputed by scientists. A European parliament technical paper entitled Seals and Fish Stocks in Scottish Waters found: “The effects of predation by both species of seals on overall stock abundance of most fish species is likely to be insignificant.” It said seals consume relatively little fish compared with other species. Seabirds, for example, are thought to eat twice as many fish as seals in Scottish waters. Another study, which was conducted in Ireland in 2015, found seals mostly eat smaller fish, which commercial fishers cannot legally take. Experts have also pointed out that seals face unfair persecution because they are larger and more obvious than other marine predators that compete with fisheries for prey. It is also accepted by scientists that seals are an important part of the food chain. As apex predators, seals control populations of prey, as well as spreading nutrients around, which in turn feeds plankton and other organisms at the bottom of the food chain. They are also indicators of a healthy marine ecosystem. Despite this, there is animosity from some fisheries towards seals. Until recently, it was legal in Scotland to shoot seals to protect the salmon farming industry, with 80 shot in 2020. The Scottish government stopped issuing licences to kill seals last year, to protect £180m in annual salmon exports to the US, which is banning imports from countries that allow seals to be killed to protect fisheries. The Blue Planet Society, a volunteer pressure group working to protect the marine ecosystem, condemned the comments from the Cornish fishers group. A spokesperson said: “Cannot believe a UK commercial fishing page thinks it is acceptable to post this propaganda and call for a seal cull. It’s likely that seals – through tourism-related activities – contribute more to the UK economy than the fishing industry does. “It was Cornish Mackerel Fishermen that called for the seal cull. And here we were thinking that line-caught fish from small-scale fisheries was the sustainable choice. Please keep this in mind next time you see the label ‘Cornish mackerel’.” The Guardian contacted fishers group for comment.",News/Environment,‘Rats of the sea’: backlash after Cornish fishers call for seal cull,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/25/rats-of-the-sea-backlash-after-cornish-fishers-call-for-seal-cull
4/26/2022,"Name: Nose jobs. Age: The earliest known description of plastic surgery on the nose is recorded in the Edwin Smith papyrus, c1600BC. Appearance: Smaller, straighter, more upturned. Also less popular. Really? Less popular? That’s right. The number of rhinoplasties performed in the UK has been dropping steadily for a decade, from 4,878 in 2013 to just 1,330 last year. Why is that? Have people finally realised that our commonly accepted standards of beauty are too narrow? Oh my, no. You mean they’re just resigned to living with the noses they were born with? Not at all. According to the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS), rhinoplasties are still the sixth most popular cosmetic surgery for women. The difference is that there are now other options. Such as full-time mask-wearing? We’re talking about alternative, nonsurgical treatments, including the injection of fillers to straighten out bumpy noses. Why would someone prefer such a procedure over a real nose job? For a start, a real nose job can cost up to £7,000. “Nonsurgical rhinoplasty” is available for less than £300. That’s all I needed to hear. Also, surgery requires a two-night hospital stay and up to two weeks off work. And the nonsurgical version? It takes 10 minutes, and you can go back to work the same day. The sheer convenience means it is one of the fastest growing treatments available. In that case, why would anyone still opt for an old-fashioned nose job? Fillers can’t make a big nose smaller – you still need surgery for that. And injection treatments aren’t permanent: the effects last somewhere between six months and two years. You mean I’d have to do it all over again? Yes, but this could also be considered an advantage. “Rhinoplasty has the highest dissatisfaction rate of any cosmetic procedure,” Rajan Uppal, a consultant plastic surgeon and member of BAAPS, told the Times. So fillers lessen the likelihood of experiencing buyers’ remorse? Exactly. “I have seen many patients who regret the whole operation and want to go back to exactly their original nose,” said Uppal. Several celebrities have expressed regret at their rhinoplasties, in fact. Name one. Well, the model Bella Hadid told Vogue that she regretted the surgery she underwent at the age of 14. “I wish I had kept the nose of my ancestors,” she said. Too late. That’s just it – with a nonsurgical rhinoplasty you always have the option of going back to the old you. What will they think of next? Tattoos that come off? They already have those. Do say: “Give me Bella Hadid’s old nose, and quick: I’m on my lunch hour.” Don’t say: “Nothing fancy. Just add a little ledge to help my glasses stay on.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,A nosedive in nose jobs: why fewer people are opting for rhinoplasty,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/apr/25/a-nosedive-in-nose-jobs-why-fewer-people-are-opting-for-rhinoplasty
4/26/2022,"The Romanian pianist Radu Lupu, who has died at the age of 76, shot to prominence in the UK when he won the Leeds Piano Competition in 1969, giving an acclaimed Wigmore Hall recital in November of the same year. In fact the Leeds was the third of a series of international piano competitions he won – the others being the Van Cliburn (1966) and the George Enescu International (1967) – though he had remained a student at the Moscow Conservatoire until 1969. It was immediately obvious that a truly exceptional talent had arrived on the scene. The following year he made the first of his recordings for Decca: solo works by Schubert and Brahms. By now he was firmly established as one of the major pianists of his time, a reputation he was to consolidate as the years went by. What struck listeners from the start was the almost mystical quality of his playing, which was searching, poetic and profoundly responsive to the inner life of the music that seemed to unfold organically as he played. The velvety tone, captured well in the Decca recordings, lent his readings an exquisite refinement, with an attention to detail so precise as to make the listener marvel at the freshness of inspiration. Within a generally narrow dynamic spectrum (from piano to mezzo forte) he could produce an extraordinary range of tonal colouring, allowing a final cadential flourish to make all the more impact. He could occasionally sound more clangorous in climactic passages; for example, cadenzas of concertos. The straight-backed chair Lupu adopted in preference to a conventional piano stool resulted in a less performative posture than usual, enhancing the impression of musician and instrument as a single entity. A complete lack of exhibitionism or flamboyance, together with a total technical command, emphasised the sense of effortlessness and inevitability in his playing. His hirsute physical appearance, somewhat grizzled in later years, evoked that of an anchorite – perhaps St Jerome in the wilderness – in communion with the eternal verities. And indeed he was notoriously reclusive, shunning interviews and even the concert platform – his public performances became collector’s items. Notwithstanding the acclaimed Decca series, he disliked recording: not only because of his self-confessed “microphone fright”, but because his concern for the structural integrity of creative inspiration rendered the editing process anathema to him. Lupu once divulged that his peerless tone control came not from his hands, but from his head – or rather his inner ear. “All you have to work for is to match that sound on the instrument. The whole balance, the line, the tone, is perceived and controlled by the head.” The repertoire in which he specialised, particularly as far as his recordings were concerned, revolved around the Viennese classics (Beethoven, Mozart, Schubert), plus Brahms and Schumann, though he also played Debussy, Liszt, Franck, Bartók, Enescu and Janáček. With orchestra he recorded the complete cycle of Beethoven concertos (with the Israel Philharmonic under Zubin Mehta), but only the first of the two Brahms concertos (LPO/Edo de Waart) and those of Grieg and Schumann (LSO/Previn), together with a pair of Mozart concertos, K414 and K467 (English Chamber Orchestra/Uri Segal). He recorded Mozart violin sonatas with Szymon Goldberg, the Debussy and Franck violin sonatas with Kyung Wha Chung, and an album of Mozart and Schubert four-hand piano music with Murray Perahia (the latter on CBS Masterworks). Frustrating as it is to have so many gaps in his recorded legacy – especially given his too infrequent concert appearances – the value of what has been preserved, mostly in a 28-disc set released by Decca in 2015, could be said to be all the greater. Born in Galaţi, Romania, he was the only child of Meyer Lupu, a lawyer, and Ana (nee Gabor), a teacher of French. He had his first piano lessons at the age of six and made his public debut six years later with a complete programme of his own music. He continued his studies with Florica Musicescu and Cella Delavrancea, winning a scholarship in 1961 to the Moscow Conservatoire where his teachers included Heinrich and Stanislav Neuhaus. He once described himself as essentially an autodidact, though he acknowledged the influence of the Polish-American pianist Mieczysław Horszowski on his playing. In 1975, he gave the premiere of André Tchaikovsky’s Second Piano Concerto (written for him) at the Royal Festival Hall in London with the Royal Philharmonic under Segal. In the same year he made his debut with the Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam and in 1978 with the Berlin Philharmonic under Herbert von Karajan at the Salzburg festival. Thereafter he played with many leading conductors all over the world. His last London concert was in February 2019, when he played Beethoven’s Fourth Piano Concerto with the Philharmonia Orchestra under Paavo Järvi. Although the concert had not been announced as his last – he formally retired from the concert stage at the end of that season – there was an unmistakably valedictory hue to his playing of an encore by Brahms (the first of the Op 117 Intermezzi), that even by Lupu’s standards had an uncommonly rapt, timeless quality imbued with ineffable sadness. Few executants have been so effusively praised by their colleagues. Among the many celebrated artists who cite Lupu as a formative influence on their own music-making are Daniel Barenboim, Mitsuko Uchida, Stephen Hough and Steven Isserlis. In 1971, he married the cellist Elizabeth Wilson, author of books on Shostakovich, Rostropovich and Du Pré. Following their divorce he married, in 1990, Delia Bugarin, a violinist in the Orchestre de Chambre de Lausanne. She survives him, along with a son, Daniel, from another relationship and two grandchildren.

4/26/2022,"Real Madrid are close to signing Antonio Rüdiger on a free transfer after reaching a verbal agreement with the Chelsea defender over a lucrative four-year contract. Rüdiger held positive talks with the Bernabéu club’s hierarchy over the weekend and is set to receive a considerable pay rise after deciding to leave Chelsea when his contract expires at the end of the season. Madrid’s manager, Carlo Ancelotti, has identified the Germany international as a key signing in defence and while the move has not been finalised it is expected to be confirmed soon. The 29-year-old is expected to earn at least £200,000 a week. Chelsea were desperate to keep Rüdiger, who currently earns around £90,000 a week, but were unable to reach an agreement with the commanding centre-back before the sanctions imposed on Roman Abramovich left the club unable to make signings or hand out new contracts. Talks with the player broke down after the European champions offered him a deal worth at least £200,000 a week, only to be met with a request for a signing-on fee and large agent’s fees for the player’s representatives. The negotiations ended with Rüdiger rejecting Chelsea’s offer and the uncertainty over the club’s ownership has played a huge part in his impending departure. The former Roma defender was not willing to wait for Abramovich to sell the club and has decided to seek a new challenge. Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Manchester United, Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain have targeted Rüdiger but Madrid are expected to be his next destination. His arrival will boost Ancelotti’s options in central defence. Losing Rüdiger will be a big setback for Thomas Tuchel, whose defence is expected to be weakened further by Andreas Christensen joining Barcelona on a free transfer. The situation will force Chelsea’s next owners to spend heavily on defensive reinforcements this summer. Sevilla’s Jules Koundé is a long-term target, while there have been links with Leicester’s Wesley Fofana. It is hoped the three bidders looking to buy Chelsea will find out who has been selected as the club’s preferred bidder this week.

4/26/2022,"The joke must have seemed merry at the time. The “minister for Brexit opportunities” leaves a calling card on his absent officials’ desks saying: “Sorry you were out when I visited. I look forward to seeing you in the office very soon.” He also suggests in a Mail on Sunday article that they might like to stick to what he called “the shires” and forgo their London weighting allowance. The mind reels at the replies Jacob Rees-Mogg may receive. They could include: “Have been up all night trying to think of opportunities for the 98 British scientists told to relocate to the EU if they want any research money.” Or perhaps: “Have been at home trying to think of opportunities for British farmers we have refused to protect from EU imports for a fourth time.” Or perhaps even: “I just can’t face another opportunities meeting in Whitehall.” Rees-Mogg’s Brexit has been largely responsible for 91,000 extra officials being appointed since 2015-16, of whom about 25,000 are attributable to Brexit. Lockdown and Brexit may have sent civil service productivity plummeting, but that is the fault of ministers, not officials. For two years, Rees-Mogg and his boss have been ordering workers to stay at home, causing many upheavals in their working lives as they have juggled work with other responsibilities, such as home schooling. Not all officials are like butlers, at the disposal of Rees-Mogg’s click of the fingers. It is clear that the idea of office work as the “white-collar” equivalent of clock-watching factory work is dead. The pandemic and the digital revolution have shattered the relationship between labour and location. After a post-lockdown surge, data is now showing the “return to work” has plateaued. Tube travel into central London midweek has steadied at between 60% and 67% of pre-Covid levels, with a significant rise only on Thursdays, much favoured by the “three-day hybrids”. Law and finance firms are reporting offices at between 30 and 60% of capacity. Retail footfall has stabilised at 80% of pre-Covid numbers. The property consultants Remit estimated in February that clerical occupancy was as low as just 25%, far below pre-pandemic levels. This may change over time, but something drastic has happened and is unlikely to be reversed. Nowadays the digital pressure of most types of work has little to do with the clock. Offices are inflexible and distracting places, prone to time-wasting chat and unnecessary meetings. This is in addition to the time and cost involved in commuting. We know that socialising is important to an organisation and to individual members of its staff. We know that the balance between on-screen and in-person contact is a delicate one, as is the balance between in-house and outsourcing. But we do not know how that balance is to be quantified and disciplined. It’s not just clerical labour, but workers in the retail, hospitality and transport sectors are all experiencing radical changes in their workplaces. Giantism in office blocks, department stores and shopping malls may truly be a thing of the past. As the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, bluntly retorted to Rees-Mogg, his view of work was Dickensian, bringing to mind “images of burning tallow, rheumy eyes and Marley’s ghost”. Those days are over. But perhaps Rees-Mogg’s officials, who find themselves working in a department that deals in “Brexit opportunities”, have simply despaired of coming to work 9-to-5 for a contradiction in terms.

4/26/2022,"The UK is currently experiencing an acute shortage of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) products. But what is HRT, and what is causing the shortages? HRT boosts levels of hormones that wane as women get older and approach the menopause, in particular oestrogen. By doing so, HRT helps to alleviate a host of symptoms associated with the menopause, from hot flushes to night sweats and vaginal dryness. It is estimated about 80% of women going through the menopause experience such symptoms. According to the NHS, HRT typically involves both oestrogen and progestogen, although there are forms that involve only the former – these can be used by women who have had a hysterectomy or are using an intrauterine system. There are various different schedules and methods for taking the hormones, and different doses can be used. HRT can not only improve women’s quality of life but may also have other benefits, such as protecting against thinning of bones. However, some women have health conditions that may make HRT unsuitable for them, while the therapy has also been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer – although some experts have pointed out the risk remains low and is greater for some forms of HRT than others. According to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), about a million women in the UK use treatment for the symptoms of the menopause, although access to HRT has been described as a “postcode lottery”. In October the Department of Health and Social Care announced women in England would be able to get a year’s supply of an HRT drug for the cost of a single NHS prescription – although implementation has been delayed – while in February plans were revealed for one form of HRT to be made available over the counter in the UK. Speaking to the Times, Labour MP Carolyn Harris, chair of the government’s menopause taskforce, said about 30,000 women use Oestrogel – an oestrogen-only form of HRT produced by Besins Healthcare UK, which is at the heart of the current shortages. This is not the first time there has been a shortage of HRT. At present, however, shortages are primarily affecting Oestrogel as well as a handful of other forms of HRT including FemSeven Sequi patches. Besins said the Oestrogel supply problem was limited to the UK and the result of increased demand for HRT. The British Menopause Society (BMS) said: “Besins expects this to be a short-term issue and anticipates that supplies will be available to local wholesaler branches soon.” Data from NHS England shows that prescriptions for HRT have more than doubled in over the past five years. “Following a recent increase in campaigning and media coverage – of menopause symptoms, their impact, and the role HRT can play – demand has grown, and more doctors are prescribing it. Unfortunately, supply has not kept pace with increased demand, however,” said Dr Clare Spencer of My Menopause Centre. However, some ministers have also cited manufacturing problems, with the supply of ingredients used by some companies disrupted by Covid and other issues. Janet Morrison, chief executive of the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee, acknowledged the shortage. “Demand for HRT prescriptions is currently outstripping supply following the announcement of changes to HRT prescription charges,” she said. “This can be exacerbated by prescribers issuing prescriptions for six or 12 months at a time.” The BMS advises women who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining Oestrogel to consider equivalent products, such as Sandrena gel, while prescribers should also consider alternatives for their patients. However, some experts have noted that women are often on a particular HRT regime that is right for them, making changes problematic. Speaking to Radio 4’s Today programme on Monday, Harris said the shortage of Oestrogel was down to bad planning, and that opting for similar products had led to a rush on them, too. She added while there was a pill alternative, this was only available in two geographical areas of the UK, meaning it is “stacked high in warehouses”. On Sunday the health secretary, Sajid Javid, revealed he planned to create an HRT tsar to tackle the shortage. But Harris said Javid should take on the role himself. “He could decide to loosen the regulations on the formularies and make this [pill] product available across the country,” she said. Spencer also called for action. “What’s important now is for government to urgently work with manufacturers to increase production and ensure that we don’t have a repeat of this situation, and that the government expedites the reduction in HRT prescription fees it promised last year, which Harris has tirelessly campaigned for,” she said.",News/Society,What is HRT and why are there shortages in the UK?,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/25/hrt-shortage-uk-why-hormone-replacement-therapy
4/26/2022,"“Oh no, no, don’t go down that route,” replies Ravi Shastri, his familiar baritone laugh bellowing down the phone line from Mumbai when asked if he would be interested in filling the vacant position of England men’s head coach. “Haha. Oh no. Seven years with India – a full-time job, 300 days a year, 1.4 billion people judging you every day – that takes its toll. Good luck to anyone who lasts that long.” It was a cheeky inquiry, admittedly, coming midway through a freewheeling chat to discuss the rarely attempted switch from television commentator to running a national team. Rob Key left the Sky box to become the director of England men’s cricket last week and Shastri had noted a line in the Guardian that compared this with his time as India’s equivalent from 2014 to 2016, and then a hugely successful spell as head coach from 2017 until last year, after more than two decades as a broadcaster. “I had no warning,” he says. “I was commentating at the Oval during India’s [2014] tour of England and came off air to find six or seven missed calls. ‘Seven bloody calls? What’s happened here?’. [The BCCI] just said: ‘We want you to take over, starting tomorrow, at any cost’. I told them I’d have to speak to my family and commercial partners but they just said they would sort all that out. And like that I was straight in from the commentary box. You’ll see when I joined the setup [during the ODIs], I was still in jeans and loafers. Instantly my job changed.” It is worth stating at this juncture that while Shastri, like Key, had no coaching qualifications and – bar a brief stint as India’s team manager in 2007 – had spent his retirement from playing behind the microphone, the worlds they walked into are vastly different. With head coaches and a selector still to be appointed by England, responsibilities will be fanned out and Key is unlikely to don the training gear. Nevertheless, Shastri insists the broader challenges are the same, not least entering a setup as an outsider who previously had to pass judgment on the players. “Rob may have more work with the domestic game but when it comes to the national team, it is very similar,” he says. “The most important thing is getting among the players and setting a tone from the outset: what you believe in, what you think of them and changing the mindset to compete and win. You have to be bullish and brutish in wanting to achieve that. For us, and now England, it was about setting the challenge of winning abroad, big time. I was very firm when it came to team culture: all the prima donnas and all that shit, that had to go out of the window early. “And you leave everything you said as a commentator behind. Park it. When I was the director of the team, it was about diagnosing problems: I was asked to hire and fire, whoever I wanted I could get in and whoever I didn’t could be shown the door. And it was also outlining how we want to play: to be aggressive and ruthless, to up the fitness levels, to get a group of fast bowlers to take 20 wickets overseas. And it was about attitude, especially when playing the Aussies. I told the boys if one single ‘fuck you’ comes your way, give them three back: two in our language and one in theirs.” It’s a classic Shastri-ism, the same moustachioed chutzpah that has run through from his playing days like words in a stick of rock. He and Key are different characters – there is only one Ravi Shastri, let’s be honest – but both call the game as they see it. And though the 59-year-old warns there will be resentment of his slightly left-field appointment, he is adamant the volume of cricket that modern commentators consume around the world is an advantage over those who come through one system. “Rob will have an adjustment period to understand the issues and will need to speak in detail with Joe Root for his experiences as Test captain,” he says. “But in my 24 years [commentating], I did not miss a beat or a ball of Indian cricket. And he will have covered a huge amount too. So you’re not lagging behind by an inch, you’re abreast of what a team requires but also what other teams are doing. You should be able to leapfrog over all those early issues and get into the nitty gritty straight away. “And I didn’t have coaching badges [either]. Level one? Level two? Fuck that. And in a country like India, there is always jealousy or a gang of people willing you to fail. I had a thick skin, thicker than the leather of the Dukes ball you use. A real solid hide. And you need a bloody hide over here. Rob will develop this as he does the job, because every day you are judged. And I am glad he has a lot of captaincy experience from his time at Kent, because communication with the players is paramount.” So much of Shastri’s philosophy comes down to unbridled aggression and in Virat Kohli he had a captain ready to spread this through the squad. The results speak for themselves, India winning 10 Test series out of 14, rising to No 1 in the rankings and beating Australia twice in their own back yard. Key is expected to appoint Ben Stokes to lead England’s Test team, a cricketer Shastri describes as a “first class” option. “The adrenaline of captaincy – not that he needs it – could fire Stokes up to be something even more than the incredible player he is now,” he says. “The important relationship is with the captain – the moment there is friction, things go downhill. But they will be fine, because the England I saw last year, they have enough talent and skill to compete. There’s no doubt in my mind. It’s all about their mindset.” This appraisal of England may surprise some but Shastri is keen to talk up his legacy. There is one Test remaining from the series India led 2-1 last summer – to be staged at Edgbaston in July – and the former all-rounder will be back commentating for Sky, hoping his old charges, now under the captaincy of Rohit Sharma, can complete a famous double. “How many teams can win in Australia – beating an attack with Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood from 1-0 down – and then win in England? That will be hard for any team to replicate for a long time,” he says. The rescheduled fifth Test will be a strange occasion to bill given the 12-month lag and the turnover of players and coaching staff since. But whatever the outcome, it is worth acknowledging the enviable team that India brought over in 2021. Not only did they secure famous victories at Lord’s and the Oval, but did so with batters like Sharma and KL Rahul playing in a wonderfully disciplined and correct manner that sat in huge contrast to – barring Root – England’s array of Heath Robinsons and carbuncles. “Mentality and technique trump past records in domestic cricket,” he says. “Get the first two right and the runs will come. It was all about the preparation. We told our batsmen to leave their driving licence behind and learn to leave the ball. Make the bowler bowl to you and you’ll score. Be prepared to bat five hours to get a century in England, it won’t come in three and you’ll get out trying. “We also had slingers [coaches with dogsticks] in the nets smashing the ball in at 160kph from 16 yards. Guys had no choice. There was no dodging, I’d stand behind the stumps to make sure of that. No matter who the person was, he had to go through that. The slingers would seriously let it rip and guys would look ugly. But you are meant to look ugly in the nets. In England you have to grind and earn your runs. “The same with the bowlers, we told them to stick in because there is a five-wicket session at any given time in England and at Lord’s and the Oval this decided the result. And we knew winning in Australia or England wasn’t coming with spin, it was fast bowlers, guys with aggression like Jasprit Bumrah. We were instrumental in making sure that guy played Test cricket. You don’t even need express pace, you just need attitude.” On the subject of bowlers, Shastri is convinced England need to suspend all future planning and bring Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad back into the fold. “If their form is good, play them,” he says. “There is no substitute for experience. Test cricket is the purest form of the game and if the guys are fit, hungry, you jolly well look in that direction. Every country makes this mistake, looking too far ahead. It’s too easy to look 100ft away and lose the plot by not backing the guys who have been there and done it.” Stokes is believed to be in agreement here but, in keeping with the conversation, we have gone off on a tangent. Shastri has been the one dictating terms throughout, that booming drill-sergeant voice not one to interrupt and almost infectious enough to convince this failed player to dig out the old kitbag. But does he have one final piece of advice for Key after swapping punditry for team management? “Tell your players to embrace the culture of a country, mix with its people, understand who they are, then give them everything, so they know a force is coming for them,” he says. “Give it right back and get some runs. Stand up, have the stomach for a fight and when you get the ball, give it right back, no compromise. It’s all about results but the goodwill if you succeed? Well, you don’t get that as a player or a commentator.”",Sport/Sport,Ravi Shastri: ‘Rob Key will develop a thick skin.

4/26/2022,"Five railway stations in central and western Ukraine were hit by Russian airstrikes in the space of one hour on Monday, as the war grinds on relentlessly in the south and east of the country. Oleksander Kamyshin, the head of Ukrainian Railways, said five train stations came under fire causing an unspecified number of casualties, as most of Ukraine was placed under an unusually long air raid warning for two hours on Monday morning. Kamyshin said one of the attacks took place at about 8.30am in Krasne, near Lviv in western Ukraine, at what the governor of the region described as a “traction substation” that handled power supply to other lines. He said emergency workers were at the scene. Maksym Kozytskyi, the head of the regional government in Lviv, said that during the attack Ukrainian anti-aircraft systems destroyed another missile fired at the region. Ukraine’s military command said Russia was trying to bomb rail infrastructure in order to disrupt arms supplies from foreign countries. “They are trying to destroy the supply routes of military-technical assistance from partner states. To do this, they focus strikes on railway junctions,” it wrote in a Facebook post on Monday. It is not the first time that Russia has launched an attack on train stations in Ukraine. On 8 April, in Kramatorsk, in eastern Ukraine, two ballistic missiles exploded over the railway station building, dropping deadly cluster munitions that killed 59 people and injured hundreds more. Russian missile strikes on an oil refinery and power plant in Kremenchuk killed one person and wounded seven, according to officials. Moscow said it had destroyed oil production facilities there. Serhiy Borzov, the governor of the Vinnytsia region in central Ukraine, said Moscow fired rockets at two towns causing an unspecified number of deaths and injuries. Russian shelling and assaults continued on Monday along most of the front in the east, including missile and bomb attacks on a huge steelworks in Mariupol where 1,000 civilians are holed up along with about 2,000 Ukrainian fighters. Serhiy Volyna, the commander of Ukraine’s 36th marine brigade forces in Mariupol, said in an interview with an opposition lawmaker posted on YouTube on Sunday that Russia was targeting the complex with air and artillery bombardments. “We are taking casualties, the situation is critical … we have very many wounded men, [some] are dying, it’s a difficult [situation] with guns, ammunition, food, medicines … the situation is rapidly worsening,” Volyna said, speaking from his location at the plant. Meanwhile, in Kyiv, growing evidence of sexual violence is emerging from areas previously occupied by Russia’s forces. The Russian defence ministry said in a statement on Monday it was opening a humanitarian corridor at 2pm (11am GMT) Monday for all civilians to leave the besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol. “The armed forces of the Russian Federation and the formations of the Donetsk people’s republic from 2pm Moscow time on 25 April 2022 unilaterally cease any hostilities, units are withdrawn to a safe distance and ensure the withdrawal of the specified category of citizens in any directions they choose,” the defence ministry said in a statement posted on its official Facebook page. Ukrainian officials have said that up to 1,000 civilians are sheltering at the giant steel plant, and earlier blamed Russia for not holding fire during previous attempts to establish humanitarian routes out of the city. The Russian defence ministry on Monday also repeated its claims that “nationalists” were holding civilians hostages as “human shields” at the Azovstal plant. It said: “If civilians are still at the metallurgical plant, then we demand that the Kyiv authorities immediately give the appropriate order to the commanders of nationalist formations for their release.” The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, have returned to Poland after a visit to Kyiv, the highest-level US visit to the capital since Russia invaded in February. During talks, Blinken and Austin told Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that the US would provide more than $300m (£235m) in military financing and had approved a $165m sale of ammunition, bringing total US security assistance since the invasion to about $3.7bn. More than $400m will also be split among 15 other nations in central and eastern Europe and the Balkans. Russia told the US to stop sending arms to Ukraine, with Moscow’s ambassador to Washington warning that large western deliveries of weapons were inflaming the conflict and would lead to more losses. Anatoly Antonov, Russia’s ambassador to the US, said such arms deliveries were aimed at weakening Russia but that they were escalating the conflict in Ukraine while undermining efforts to reach some sort of peace agreement. “What the Americans are doing is pouring oil on the flames,” Antonov told the Rossiya 24 TV channel. “I see only an attempt to raise the stakes, to aggravate the situation, to see more losses.” Antonov, who has served as ambassador to Washington since 2017, said an official diplomatic note had been sent to Washington expressing Russia’s concerns. No reply had been given, Antonov said. “We stressed the unacceptability of this situation when the United States of America pours weapons into Ukraine, and we demanded an end to this practice,” Antonov said. The interview was replayed on Russian state television throughout Monday.
