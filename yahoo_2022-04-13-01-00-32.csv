4/13/2022,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea is destroying a South Korean-owned golf course at a scenic mountain resort in the second confirmed case of South Korean assets being eliminated in an area where the rivals once ran a joint tour program, officials said Tuesday in Seoul. North Korea’s demolition of South Korean-built facilities at its Diamond Mountain resort comes as ties between the countries remain strained over the North’s recent series of high-profile missile tests. Responding to queries by The Associated Press, Seoul’s Unification Ministry said it has confirmed North Korea is demolishing the golf resort in addition to a South Korean-owned hotel there. Last Friday, the ministry said North Korea was dismantling the Haegumgang Hotel, a floating hotel docked at a coastal area in the resort. The ministry said it strongly urges North Korea to stop destroying the South Korean facilities. It demanded North Korea return to talks to address the issue. The two Koreas jointly ran a tour project at the resort for about 10 years during an earlier era of inter-Korean detente. The tours drew an estimated 2 million South Korean visitors and served as a rare source of foreign currency for the impoverished North. But South Korea suspended the project in 2008 after one of its tourists was fatally shot by a North Korean soldier there. After their relations improved in 2018, the two Koreas pushed to resume stalled cooperation projects including the mountain tours. But Seoul eventually failed to do so without defying U.S.-led sanctions that kept the tours from restarting. In 2019, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered officials to tear down South Korean-owned assets in the resort, but the demolition was delayed due to worries about the spread of the coronavirus. North Korea has sought sanctions relief and other concessions from the United States and South Korea to revive its moribund economy. Some experts say its recent weapons testing activity was meant to perfect its missile technology and boost its leverage in future negotiations with its rivals. Besides the golf resort and floating hotel, South Korea owns other facilities in the resort such as spas, a culture center, accommodations, a duty free shop, karaoke rooms and a building used for reunions of Korean families separated by war. The fate of those facilities was unclear. The North’s state media reported Tuesday that a fire in the Diamond Mountain area over the weekend destroyed unspecified facilities and hundreds of hectares of forests. It said the blaze was put out on Sunday. It wasn’t immediately known if the fire was related to the demolition of the South Korean facilities at the resort. The South Korean Unification Ministry said it was trying to find out if the fire caused any damage to its facilities in the resort.",World/Associated Press,Seoul: North Korea destroying S.

4/13/2022,"China's development of advanced anti-ship weapons has renewed debate about the future of aircraft carriers. US officials say carriers aren't invulnerable but are well defended and won't be easy to attack. ""Anyone who thinks that we're fragile little teacups out there or something like that is grossly mistaken,"" said Capt. Paul Campagna. In March 1922, the US Navy's first aircraft carrier, USS Langley, entered service. A century later, some are questioning whether carriers can survive in the wars of the future. The development of increasingly sophisticated anti-ship weapons by capable adversaries, namely Russia and China, has raised new doubts about those ships. The captains of two of those carriers discount the concern, arguing that the US Navy's 11 flattops would be tough to find and hard to stop. Questions about whether carriers are ""obsolete"" have come up before, including when Congress was debating whether to build USS Enterprise, the Navy's first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, in the late 1950s, said Capt. Paul Campagna, commanding officer of USS Dwight D. Eisenhower. ""I think the aircraft carrier has shown itself to be very enduring. For anyone that's worried about the modern threat that's out there, I'll just say that the carrier is not on an island,"" Campagna said on April 5 at the Sea Air Space conference in National Harbor, Maryland. ""It deploys with the air wing. It deploys with the strike group. It deploys with a layered defense that goes from the bottom of the ocean and out to space, and anyone who thinks that we're fragile little teacups out there or something like that is grossly mistaken,"" Campagna added. The doubts about the carrier's future are driven in large part by China's military modernization, which has produced a variety of long-range weapons and more capable aircraft, ships, and submarines to launch them. China's anti-ship missiles are the major concern, especially the DF-21D and DF-26B ballistic missiles, which are designed for naval targets and sometimes called ""carrier killers."" The DF-21D was introduced in the mid-2000s and the DF-26 was first seen in public in 2015. They have long been seen as a threat to US ships and bases. China has built targets shaped like US aircraft carriers and destroyers, and hawkish Chinese officials have advocated using those missiles against the real thing. In August 2020, the Chinese military fired a DF-21D and a DF-26B into the South China Sea in what was seen as a demonstration of its ability to deny access to the sea, where Beijing has made sweeping but widely rejected territorial claims. In an interview that December, Adm. Philip Davidson, then-head of US Indo-Pacific Command, confirmed the missiles were fired at ""a moving target"" and said US officials have ""known for years"" that China was pursuing that capability. In written testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee in March 2021, Davidson said ""mid-range, anti-ship ballistic missiles"" — specifically the DF-21 — ""are capable of attacking aircraft carriers in the Western Pacific."" The use of the missiles in a large-scale exercise was meant to demonstrate the Chinese military's ""focus on countering any potential third-party intervention during a regional crisis,"" Davidson wrote at the time. China also has air- and sea-launched anti-ship cruise missiles that, when fired from new warships, submarines, and long-range bombers, can reach deep into the Pacific. China and Russia are both developing hypersonic weapons that could use their speed and maneuverability to evade missile defenses, potentially striking a carrier thousands of miles from shore. The Chinese are ""pouring a lot of money in the ability to basically rim their coast in the South China Sea with anti-ship-missile capability. It's a destabilizing effort in the South China Sea, the East China Sea — all of those areas,"" Vice Adm. Jeffrey Trussler, director of naval intelligence, said in February 2021. Current and former US Navy officials acknowledge that carriers are not invulnerable, but they stress that the ships are well defended and resilient and need to accept some risk to be effective. ""With the compartimentalization that we have, with our ability to man repair lockers throughout the ship — which are basically fire stations inside the ship — and our ability to seal it up and to absorb any kind of kinetic impact with 1,000 feet of steel, it's designed to take it. We're ready to go. We're lethal,"" Campagna said. The Navy conducted ""shock trials"" on its newest carrier, USS Gerald R. Ford, in summer 2021, detonating 40,000-pound explosive charges in the water around it. Ford was the first carrier to go through shock trials since 1987. The trials didn't simulate a direct hit, but Navy officials said Ford only needed a fraction of the repairs as the last carrier to go through them. The trials were a demonstration of ""super resilience"" against conventional anti-ship weapons, a Chinese commentator said in August. US carriers are ""incredibly well built, as you saw with the shock trials on Ford,"" Campagna said. ""These things will take it and continue to operate, so I'm very confident in the aircraft carrier [and] very confident taking it out to sea in any environment."" The layered defenses Campagna referred to include anti-ballistic-missile systems aboard the ships of the carrier strike group. The US Missile Defense Agency is also pursuing sea-borne defenses for hypersonic threats. The carrier itself has sensors and defenses, including surface-to-air missiles, radar-guided cannons, and ""soft kill"" measures like decoys and electronic jamming. Chinese and Russian submarines are also a growing concern, and the US and allied navies have reemphasized anti-submarine warfare. The risks of long-range missiles are forcing planners to reconsider combat operations to keep carriers and other ships out of range of those missiles until US bombers, submarines and long-range missiles can knock them out. The US Navy is also pursuing longer-range aircraft and weaponry in order to continue operating in such a scenario. The MQ-25 carrier-based refueling drone, which will extend the range of carrier aircraft, was recently tested aboard a carrier for the first time. Hitting US carriers also requires Chinese forces to find and track them. Carriers can move while a missile is in flight, meaning the missile needs to be able to locate them or to receive updated guidance. Flying at thousands of miles per hour also produces friction that can affect the missile's accuracy and be spotted by radars. The effectiveness of anti-ship ballistic missiles ""hinges on a comprehensive reconnaissance and targeting architecture,"" which for China ""remains a work in progress,"" Andrew Erickson, a professor at the US Naval War College's China Maritime Studies Institute, said in a November 2020 interview. Missile guidance systems have existed for decades, and China could overcome deficiencies in its own guidance systems by firing more missiles at a specific area. Campanga and his counterparts emphasized that their carriers won't wait for those missiles to arrive. ""Moving around at 30 knots, you can cover a lot of sea space and make it very challenging,"" Campanga said. The carrier's speed and maneuverability means ""figuring out who actually is where is not a small thing,"" said Capt. Paul Lanzilotta, the Ford's commanding officer. ""We're fast, we're maneuverable, and we will use all of those things to our advantage,"" Lanzilotta said. ""If you don't have an appreciation for how big the actual ocean is, then you don't have an appreciation for what the problem set is.""

4/13/2022,"As Russia’s war of aggression continues to ravage its neighbor, the Kremlin’s propaganda apparatus has been more blatant than ever in outlining the country’s goals for its biggest nemesis: the U.S. Last week, American intelligence officials reportedly assessed that Russian President Vladimir Putin may use the Biden administration’s support for Ukraine as a pretext to order a new campaign to interfere in U.S. elections. Though AP reported that “it is not yet clear which candidates Russia might try to promote or what methods it might use,” Russian state media seem to be in agreement that former U.S. President Donald Trump remains Moscow’s candidate of choice. The time is coming “to again help our partner Trump to become president,” state TV host Evgeny Popov recently declared. On Thursday’s edition of the state television show The Evening With Vladimir Soloviev, Putin’s pet pundits offered an update on plans for 2024. Kremlin TV Hopes Russia’s Unhinged Ukraine War Claim Will Help Re-Elect Trump “We’re trying to feel our way, figuring out the first steps. What can we do in 2023, 2024?,” Russian “Americanist” Malek Dudakov, a political scientist specializing in the U.S., said. He suggested that Russia’s interference in the upcoming elections is still in its early stages, and that more will be accomplished after the war is over and frosty relations between the U.S. and Russia start to warm up. “When things thaw out and the presidential race for 2024 is firmly on the agenda, there’ll be moments we can use,” he added. “The most banal approach I can think of is to invite Trump—before he announces he’s running for President—to some future summit in liberated Mariupol.” Dmitry Drobnitsky, an omnipresent “Americanist” on Soloviev’s show, suggested that Tulsi Gabbard should be invited along with Trump. Dudakov agreed: “Tulsi Gabbard would also be great. Maybe Trump will take her as his vice-president?” Gabbard has recently become a fixture of state television for her pro-Russian talking points, and has even been described as a “Russian agent” by the Kremlin’s propaganda machine. If state television is any indication, the real agenda of the Kremlin’s operatives was never limited to boosting any particular candidates, but rather aimed to harm America as a whole. Dudakov stressed: “With Europe, economic wars should take priority. With America, we should be working to amplify the divisions and—in light of our limited abilities—to deepen the polarization of American society.” Watch: Biden vows to 'ratchet up the pain' on Putin to increase economic isolation He went on: “There is a horrific polarization of society in the United States, very serious conflicts between the Democrats and Republicans that keep expanding. You’ve already mentioned that America is a dying empire—and most empires weren’t conquered, they were destroyed from within. The same fate likely awaits America in the near decade. That’s why, when all the processes are thawed, Russia might get the chance to play on that.” Dudakov’s Twitter feed, which he maintains despite the service being blocked in Russia, offers a glimpse into his own propaganda efforts. Tweeting as “Duderman67,” Dudakov focuses on criticizing U.S. President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and Hillary Clinton—while boosting Trump. On his Thursday show, host Soloviev argued that Russia wasn’t fighting against the United States with full competency just yet, and griped about losing the main weapon behind enemy lines: “the brilliantly working structure of RT,” the Kremlin-funded state TV network that was banished from U.S. cable stations last month. He then offered up his own ideas about how to influence American voters without the help of RT: “I would act through various diasporas. For example, I would work with the Spanish-speaking media—since America is becoming predominantly Spanish-speaking, with the colossal influence of Latin America, I would work through their press, through those narratives, moving in that direction… they aren’t allowing us to work with American media directly, but we have many opportunities that we aren’t using thus far.” Appearing on Soloviev’s show two days earlier, Vitaly Tretyakov, dean of the Moscow State University's School of Television, complained that Russia: “had military hypersonic weapons, but we don’t have informational hypersonic weapons… all of our forces need to be dedicated to that. We don’t have info-weapons equal in strength to our hypersonic weapons... as opposed to what they have. You can’t survive in this world without winning an info-war. That is out of the question.” Putin Crony Melts Down After Airing Wrong Clip of Soldiers Calling Russia ‘a Bitch’ Pundit Karen Shakhnazarov suggested: “I would find it useful to break diplomatic relations with the United States. I don’t see any point in maintaining them. And that would deliver a crushing blow to Biden. There are plenty of people in the U.S. who say that he is bringing us all to the edge of nuclear war. That will be a strong signal.” That wasn’t the only talk of nuclear war on Soloviev’s show this week. On Thursday, Soloviev confirmed a well-known concept frequently aired on state media when he acknowledged: “De facto, we aren’t fighting a campaign against Ukraine, but against the entire West.” A parade of pundits recounted various ways U.S. sanctions are affecting the Russian economy, and the limited avenues for Russian retaliation. Soloviev resorted to pulling out his beloved trump card designed to intimidate the West: the threat of nuclear war. He asked: “Maybe it’s time we strike them? Since we’re already a pariah state, a war criminal, if everything is so bad.” Short of nuclear holocaust, it is now clear that Russia is focusing its efforts on distracting America from its foreign policy objectives by threatening to meddle in U.S. internal affairs. Speaking about the upcoming midterm elections on Soloviev’s show last week, Konstantin Dolgov, the deputy chairman of the Committee on Economic Policy of Russia’s Federation Council, predicted that “the results will apparently not be good for the Democrats,” because of rising gas prices in the U.S. But the midterms, he emphasized, are “just a rehearsal. The main elections are further ahead and preparations for those are already underway.” Read more at The Daily Beast. Get the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

4/13/2022,"By Satoshi Sugiyama and Maki Shiraki TOKYO (Reuters) - The weak yen was once a cause for celebration for Japanese companies, as they could sell cars and cameras cheaper abroad and enjoyed fatter profits when earnings were brought home. These days, it's not so straightforward. After years of bolstering overseas production and supply chains, Japan's manufacturers now see less benefit from a softer currency, company officials and economists say. In fact, the economic pain from a weaker yen has become stark now, as the recent yen sell-off has sharply lifted commodities costs in a blow to household spending. It also shows how the steady move to overseas production is slowly changing the dynamics of the world's no.3 economy. WHAT'S CHANGED FOR JAPANESE COMPANIES? Almost a quarter of Japanese manufacturers' production is carried out overseas, according to the latest trade ministry data. That compares to around 17% a decade ago and less than 15% two decades ago. Around two-thirds of the cars that Japanese makers sell annually are now made abroad, according to Reuters calculations based on data from the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association. Two decades ago, cars made overseas accounted for less than 40% of sales. Companies are also moving away from the manufacture-and-export model of old as technology has changed their businesses. Hitachi Ltd, for example, is increasingly focused on providing digital solutions to customers globally rather than just hardware. WHAT'S THE DOWNSIDE RISK? The weakness in the yen has driven up the cost of fuel and other commodities for manufacturers at home. Critically, it is also hitting household spending and consumer confidence in the domestic market - adding to the pain for a creaking economy. A December survey of nearly 7,000 companies by data and research firm Tokyo Shoko Research found that almost 30% of companies said a weak yen was a negative for their business, while 5% said it was a positive. The remaining 65% said it was neither a negative or a positive. Those that said the weak yen was negative on average cited a rate of 107 yen to the dollar as preferable - a level considerably stronger than the 125.75 hit on Tuesday. The weak yen drives up the cost of acquiring businesses overseas, although that could be less of a concern for many cash-rich Japanese firms. At the same time, the weak yen makes Japanese companies cheaper targets for foreign buyers. WHAT'S THE OUTLOOK FOR COMPANIES? Many manufacturers, including automakers, say that one of the benefits of producing more in local markets is less sensitivity to currency swings. Even though there may be concerns about producing in certain markets - such as China - it seems unlikely that the trend toward offshore production will reverse in any meaningful way soon. Toyota Motor Corp has been working to reduce the impact of the yen on its earnings, a spokesperson said, without giving details. Within the company, the weak yen was not necessarily viewed as a benefit, the spokesperson said, adding the higher cost of raw materials was one demerit. For retailers, the weak yen has been painful, as it drives up costs, including for energy and food. Budget clothing retailer Shimamura Co Ltd said recently it would have to increase the price of some of its items by an unprecedented 3-4%. WHAT DO POLICYMAKERS SAY? The Bank of Japan's governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, has repeatedly said that while the weak currency can squeeze households and retailers, the benefits to the economy https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/boj-keep-rates-low-strong-not-weak-yen-still-kurodas-enemy-no-1-2022-04-01 outweigh the negatives. But he looks increasingly alone in his emphasis on the positive, as government officials have increased their warnings against excessive yen declines. Some of Kuroda's former finance ministry colleagues now see the weak yen as a sign of Japan's fading economic power. Earlier this month he said the yen's recent moves were ""somewhat rapid"", his strongest warning yet on the currency's move, although he followed that by emphasising the benefits of a weaker yen. HOW LOW CAN IT GO? That's anyone's guess. The yen's rapid decline - last month it fell more than 5% versus the dollar, its biggest monthly drop since November 2016 - has taken some in the markets by surprise. Japan's former top currency diplomat Eisuke Sakakibara told Reuters last month that the government should intervene in the currency or raise interest rates to defend it if it weakens beyond 130 to the dollar. Weakening beyond 130 ""could cause problems"" said Sakakibara, known as ""Mr. Yen"" for masterminding several currency interventions to soften the yen in the 1990s.

The City of New Orleans rejoiced when Mayor Latoya Cantrell announced that Mardi Gras was on for 2022. The annual Carnival celebration was passed over in 2021, due the COVID-19 outbreak that sacrificed so many lives. The appropriate public health measure put in place required cancellation of gatherings statewide. This year was refreshing, but one of the best parts was a focus on breastfeeding. Several mamas were breastfeeding in the parade crowds. The temperature swung and the breasts hung, signaling a cultural shift. The moment also proved birthing people in New Orleans are not scared of social stigma, ogling eyes or negative comments. —And though New Orleans is pretty much the most progressive city in the state of Louisiana, it’s rare to see people breastfeeding at parades. RELATED CONTENT: BLACK BREASTFEEDING WEEK: So Many Women Like Me, Who Want To Be Able To Breastfeed But Can’t The cultural shift towards public breastfeeding is a strategic win on behalf of advocacy from organizations like Healthy Start and the network of Baby Cafe’s. Impact from waves of collaborative federal and philanthropic funding partnerships have included the Institute for Women Ethnic Studies, National Birth Equity Collaborative and the city-wide Maternal & Child Health Coalition. The past 3-5 years of funding still doesn’t touch the decade of work Sista Midwife Productions and Birthmark Doula Collective has invested into changing the landscape for mamas in the city through programming, community building, holding mamas and catching babies. Laissez les bon lait rouler—Let the good milk roll! The joy that comes from bearing witness to the progress of the painstaking work from the birthing community to undo generations of harm and misinformation that convinced Black women that breastfeeding is not for us. The organizations mentioned may not have legacy funding and are working hard to sustain staff while doing this culture-shifting work. Funding cycles take these leaders on a ride chasing the dragon—or rather chasing the float—of fleeting resources. Some prefer to be unbothered and unattached to these temporary waves of funding. The movement of breastfeeding in New Orleans has been led by birth workers and organizations but most importantly, the mamas in the community are creating the experience they want. Regardless if the shift has come from community-led funding or sheer feminine will, the results are visible. Shout out to new mamas in 2022.  “This is my baby’s first Mardi Gras!” left many mamas lips, while holding 18-month-old toddlers. “Happy Mardi Gras Baby!” RELATED CONTENT: BLACK BREASTFEEDING WEEK: Black Women Have Been Doing It For The Culture Since Day One Black Maternal Health Week runs April 11-April 17.

4/13/2022,"By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON (Reuters) -President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday peace talks with Ukraine had hit a dead end, using his first public comments on the conflict in more than a week to vow that his troops would win and to goad the West for failing to bring Moscow to heel. Addressing the war in public for the first time since Russian forces retreated from northern Ukraine after they were halted at the gates of Kyiv, Putin promised that Russia would achieve all of its ""noble"" aims in Ukraine. In the strongest signal to date that the war will grind on for longer, Putin said Kyiv had derailed peace talks by staging what he said were fake claims of Russian war crimes and by demanding security guarantees to cover the whole of Ukraine. ""We have again returned to a dead-end situation for us,"" Putin, Russia's paramount leader since 1999, told a news briefing during a visit to the Vostochny Cosmodrome 3,450 miles (5,550 km) east of Moscow. Asked by Russian space agency workers if the operation in Ukraine would achieve its goals, Putin said: ""Absolutely. I don't have any doubt at all."" Russia, he said, would ""rhythmically and calmly"" continue its operation. Putin said Russia had no choice but to fight because it had to defend the Russian speakers of eastern Ukraine and prevent its former Soviet neighbour from becoming an anti-Russian springboard for Moscow's enemies. The West has condemned the war as a brutal imperial-style land grab targeting a sovereign country. Ukraine says it is fighting for its survival after Putin annexed Crimea in 2014 and on Feb. 21 recognised two of its rebel regions as sovereign. Putin dismissed the West's sanctions, which have tipped Russia towards its worst economic contraction since the years following the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, as a failure. ""That Blitzkrieg on which our foes were counting did not work,"" Putin said. Putin, who had been ubiquitous on Russian television in the early days of the war, had largely retreated from public view since Russia's withdrawal from northern Ukraine two weeks ago. His only public appearance in the past week was at the funeral of a nationalist lawmaker, where he did not directly address the war. On Monday he met the visiting chancellor of Austria at a country residence outside Moscow but no images of that meeting were released. 'BUCHA IS FAKE' Putin dismissed Ukrainian and Western claims that Russia had committed war crimes as fakes. Since Russian troops withdrew from towns and villages around the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, Ukrainian troops have been showing journalists corpses of what they say are civilians killed by Russian forces, destroyed houses and burnt-out cars. Reuters saw dead bodies in the town of Bucha but could not independently verify who was responsible for the killings. Ukraine says Russia is guilty of genocide and U.S. President Joe Biden has accused Putin of war crimes and called for a trial. Putin said he had told Western leaders to think a little about destruction by the United States of the Syrian city of Raqqa, the former de facto capital of the Islamic State caliphate, and in Afghanistan. ""Have you seen how this Syrian city was turned to rubble by American aircraft? Corpses lay in the ruins for months decomposing,"" Putin said. ""Nobody cared. No one even noticed."" ""There was no such silence when provocations were staged in Syria, when they portrayed the use of chemical weapons by the Assad government. Then it turned out that it was fake. It's the same kind of fake in Bucha."" Putin, who says Ukraine and Russia are essentially one people, casts the war as an inevitable confrontation with the United States, which he accuses of threatening Russia by meddling in its backyard. Sixty one years to the day since the Soviet Union's Yuri Gagarin blasted off into the history books by becoming the first man in space, Putin drew an analogy between Soviet space successes and Russia's defiance today. ""The sanctions were total, the isolation was complete but the Soviet Union was still first in space,"" said Putin, 69, recalling his own wonderment as a schoolboy learning of the achievement. ""We don't intend to be isolated,"" Putin added. ""It is impossible to severely isolate anyone in the modern world - especially such a vast country as Russia.""

Sykaris wrote that he was dedicating his feat to ""my little Iris, my granddaughter."" ""Iris, I am at the top !!!"" he wrote. The 59-year-old had fallen ill while descending, mountain guide Mingma Sherpa of Seven Summit Treks told AFP. ""He died at an altitude of 7,400 meters. We are speaking with his family,"" Sherpa said. A message Tuesday on his official Instagram account said that he died ""after a huge physical and mental effort and lack of additional oxygen."" View this post on Instagram A post shared by Antonios Sykaris (@antonios_sykaris_official) Sykaris was an experienced climber who had summited five other mountains higher than 8,000 meters, including the world's highest mountain, Mount Everest, according to his website. Dhaulagiri's 8,170-metre (26,800-foot) peak was first scaled in 1960 by a Swiss-Austrian team and has since been climbed by hundreds of people. The spring climbing season begins each April when temperatures warm and winds are typically calm. It usually attracts hundreds of adventurers each year to Nepal, which is home to eight of the world's highest peaks. The country only reopened its peaks to mountaineers last year after the pandemic shut down the industry in 2020. But with coronavirus cases receding, expedition operators in Nepal are hopeful of a busier climbing season this year. Nepal's government has already issued permits to 530 mountaineers for the season including 204 for Everest, the world's highest peak.

4/13/2022,"An elderly woman in Washington who was accused of a hate crime against her Vietnamese neighbor last year has agreed to sell her home to pay the victim $45,000.

Jan Myers, 72, was charged with a hate crime on Thursday for harassing her neighbor Thi Pham in April 2021.

Pham’s lawyers announced that Myers has agreed to a civil settlement dictating that she must attempt to sell her home in Shoreline, Washington, and pay Pham $45,000 from the home's sale.
 
 Hate crime in Shoreline:

- She was released from jail shortly after & family says the harassment has continued

— Deedee Sun (@DeedeeKIRO7) August 18, 2021 


Pham and her husband Bill Healy’s lawyers filed a lawsuit against Myers in August 2021 after they said she had been repeatedly harassing and threatening their family, with some incidents even captured on video.

Pham said Myers started harassing them when she was working in her garden in April last year. Myers reportedly made threats and was caught on video referring to Pham as “slant eye.” Pham started recording the incident using her phone, catching Myers yelling, “Hey Miss Vietnam... you're not going to live very long.”

Healy, who called the incident “devastating,” said Myers had also exposed herself to his wife and their 2-year-old son, which was also caught on camera. As the family filed their lawsuit, Pham said she no longer felt safe in their home.

The family’s lawyers called the civil settlement a victory for victims of racial harassment.

“We need to make the people who are harassing people because of their race pay and make them pay the victim,” said lawyer Jeffery Campiche.

Under the settlement, Myers has agreed to sell her home in the next six months and pay Pham $45,000 from the sale.

Should Myers fail to sell the home and move as agreed, Pham’s lawsuit against Myers will proceed to trial and potentially be decided by a jury.

“I am happy that I can safely live in my home without racial harassment,” Pham was quoted as saying by KGW. “We hope Jan Myers follow [sic] through the agreement and move quickly.”

While the civil settlement has been agreed to, Myers may still face criminal charges for her threatening behavior, for which a trial is tentatively set to begin on June 8. Enjoy this content?

4/13/2022,"(Reuters) -Ramzan Kadyrov, the powerful head of Russia's republic of Chechnya, said early on Monday that there will be an offensive by Russian forces not only on the besieged port of Mariupol, but also on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities. ""There will be an offensive ... not only on Mariupol, but also on other places, cities and villages,"" Kadyrov said in a video posted on his Telegram channel. ""Luhansk and Donetsk - we will fully liberate in the first place ... and then take Kyiv and all other cities."" Kadyrov, who has often described himself as Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""foot soldier,"" said there should be no doubt about Kyiv. ""I assure you: not one step will be taken back,"" Kadyrov said. Kadyrov has been repeatedly accused by the United States and European Union of rights abuses, which he denies. Moscow fought two wars with separatists in Chechnya, a mainly Muslim region in southern Russia, after the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union. But it has since poured huge sums of money into the region to rebuild it and given Kadyrov a large measure of autonomy. The Kremlin describes its actions in Ukraine as a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" its neighbour and on Sunday Russia intensified its attacks in eastern Ukraine.

4/13/2022,"Russians are forcibly sending Ukrainians to remote regions in Russia, Ukrainian officials said. The Kremlin plans on sending them as far as Siberia and the Arctic Circle, The i reported. Nearly 100,000 Ukrainians will be sent to these regions, The i said, citing a Kremlin document. Russia plans to send nearly 100,000 Ukrainians as far as Siberia and the Arctic Circle, UK newspaper The i reported, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned of ""special filtration camps"" for captured people. A Kremlin document, cited by The i, shows Russia made an emergency order last month to forcibly move 95,739 Ukrainians to far-away regions in Russia. The document suggests that Ukrainians will not be sent to major cities like Moscow or St. Petersburg, but rather to remote areas located thousands of miles away from their homes. The areas include the Siberian town of Magadan, the Arctic port of Murmansk, and the Caucasus regions of Chechnya, Ingushetia, and Dagestan, according to The i. Some Ukrainians are also being sent as far as Sakhalin — a Russian island in the Pacific Ocean, located just north of Japan — The i reported. The regions have reportedly been told to update Moscow on new arrivals monthly. The report comes after Ukrainian officials accused Russia of moving thousands of people from Mariupol — a heavily bombarded southern port city in Ukraine — to so-called ""filtration camps"" along the border before forcibly relocating them to far-away regions in Russia. In a speech to the Lithuanian parliament on Tuesday, Zelenskyy said: ""There are mass deportations of people from the occupied areas. Hundreds of thousands of people have already been deported."" ""They are placed in special filtration camps,"" he added. ""Documents are taken away from them. They are interrogated and humiliated. It is unknown how many are killed."" The Mariupol City Council said last month that Russians kidnapped 20,000 of the besieged city's residents. Several women from Mariupol who said they were forced to go to the ""filtration camps"" have since spoken to media outlets, including The Guardian and The Washington Post, about what their experience was like. One unnamed woman told the Post that she was brought via bus to the Ukrainian border town of Novoazovsk after Russian soldiers found her sheltering in an underground bunker. Once in Novoazovsk, the woman told the post she was interrogated by men who said they were part of the Russian security service, the FSB. She said she was photographed and fingerprinted and also had to hand over her phone and passwords. ""At all stages of the journey, we were treated like captives or some criminals. I felt like a sack of potatoes tossed around,"" the woman told the Post. Another unnamed woman told The Guardian that she, alongside ""two or three hundred"" others, faced interrogation and had her personal items confiscated at the ""filtration camp"" in Novoazovsk. ""It was very degrading,"" she told The Guardian about the interrogation. Both women were able to break away from their groups and managed to escape to Europe, according to the Post and The Guardian. Russia has denied that anyone from Ukraine is being relocated against their will, the Post reported. Last month, the Kremlin said it had rescued 420,000 people ""from dangerous regions of Ukraine, the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics"" and evacuated them to Russia, according to the Post.

4/13/2022,"Russia’s Vladimir Putin hailed his “brave” and “effective” troops in Ukraine on Tuesday, even as social-media posts surfaced showing the Russian military suffered yet another setback after more than 40 days of war. The Russian leader vowed that his “noble” war against Ukraine would be successful and defiantly said his country could not be isolated from the rest of the world. “There is no doubt that the goals and tasks of the operation in Ukraine will be fulfilled,” he said, claiming “confrontation with the growing anti-Russian forces in Ukraine was inevitable” and only “a question of time.” “The Russian Armed Forces have acted bravely, efficiently, and effectively in the course of the special military operation in Ukraine, using the most contemporary kinds of weapons,” he said. “What we are doing is helping people, saving people, on the one hand, and on the other hand—we are simply taking measures to ensure the security of Russia itself. It’s evident that we had no other choice, this is the right decision,” he said, according to Russia’s Interfax news agency. His glowing assessment comes amid reports that another high-ranking military official was killed in Ukraine. Lt. Col. Dibir Dibirovich Magomedovich, a Dagestan native, was killed on April 9, according to a now-deleted post on the VK page of a Russian military academy. A screenshot of the since-deleted post shared by Ukrainian media outlets shows that people were invited to make donations to Magomedovich’s family. Magomedovich was reportedly based in Chechnya with the 291st Guards Motorized Rifle Regiment of the 42nd Guards Motorized Rifle Division. No details were given on where, and in what circumstances, he was killed. His death adds to a long list of senior military brass killed in Ukraine, as Russia goes all in on drumming up support for the war at home, with huge “Z” symbols popping up on theaters and museums around the country and schoolchildren instructed to write letters of support to Russian soldiers in Ukraine. Meanwhile, evidence of possible Russian war crimes in the country has continued to grow, as Ukraine’s human-rights ombudswoman told The New York Times and the BBC that Russian troops held more than two dozen women captive in a basement in Bucha while they occupied the devastated town. Nine of the women in that group—which included girls as young as 14—are now pregnant, according to the ombudswoman, Lyudmila Denisova. “Russian soldiers told them they would rape them to the point where they wouldn’t want sexual contact with any man, to prevent them from having Ukrainian children,” Denisova told the BBC. In one of the most heinous allegations against Russian troops so far, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday confirmed reports that a Russian soldier sent around video of himself sexually assaulting a baby. “That is such a Russian military ‘defender of children,’” Zelensky said in a speech before the Lithuanian parliament, quipping that Russian propagandists will likely claim the alleged abuse was “protecting Russian speakers.” According to Russian media reports, the soldier in question, Aleksei Bychkov, was arrested on Russian territory, where he serves in Pskov. It was not clear where the alleged attack on the child took place. Read more at The Daily Beast. Get the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox. Sign up now.

4/13/2022,"By Mark Trevelyan and Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen LONDON (Reuters) - Russia can afford to wage a long war in Ukraine despite being hammered by Western sanctions aimed at crippling its ability to sustain the campaign, defence experts and economists say. Russia's invasion has driven up the price of the oil, gas and grain it exports, providing it with a substantial windfall to fund its ""special military operation"" - now entering a new phase as Moscow focuses on the eastern Donbas region after failing to break Ukraine's defence of the capital Kyiv. As the war grinds on, rising casualties and the need to rotate fresh troops into battle may prove more pressing challenges than the financial cost. ""This type of low-tech war can be financed almost entirely in roubles, which means they can continue pouring troops and heavy artillery into Ukraine at least until there's a more general collapse of the economy,"" said Jacob Kirkegaard, economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. Johan Norberg, senior analyst at the Swedish Defence Research Agency, said: ""The sanctions will not affect this war in the short run, because Russia's military is fighting with tanks it had already built and soldiers it had already trained."" Sanctions are expected to shrink the economy by more than 11% this year, the World Bank says, but revenues from energy exports are actually increasing. The Russian finance ministry said on April 5 that Moscow expects to earn $9.6 billion in additional revenue from energy sales in April alone thanks to high oil prices, which remain around $100 a barrel. There is no doubt, however, that Russia's vaunted military machine has taken a huge and costly hit. The United States assesses that Russia has lost about 15-20% of its combat power during its invasion of Ukraine, a senior U.S. defence official said. That includes everything from tanks, armoured vehicles, artillery systems, fighter and bomber aircraft and helicopters to surface-to-air and ballistic missiles, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. LOST TANKS According to Oryx, a closely watched military blog which tallies both sides' losses based on verifiable visual evidence, Russia had lost at least 2,770 items of military equipment as of Tuesday, including at least 476 tanks that had been destroyed, damaged, abandoned or captured. That, said Yohann Michel of the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), is more than the combined tank strength of NATO members France (222) and Britain (227). Russia, which had around 3,000 tanks before the war, according to IISS figures, is not about to run out. But experts said some of those are likely to be old, in poor condition or held for spare parts, so the effective number available for combat is lower. Mathieu Boulegue, a specialist in the Russian military at Chatham House, said Moscow had so far held back its most modern weaponry, which it is reluctant to lose, and relied heavily on an abundance of more expendable Soviet-era hardware. He said it could take ""a decade or two at least"" to rebuild equipment levels to where they were before the war - a task complicated by a host of factors including design and innovation challenges, corruption, the indebted state of defence companies and a lack of access to Western microelectronics because of sanctions. DEFENCE BURDEN Russian military spending will need to rise both because of the war with Ukraine and the resulting sharp increase in tension with NATO, which has sent thousands more troops to eastern Europe, said Richard Connolly, an associate fellow at RUSI in London and director of the Eastern Advisory Group consultancy. He said defence spending as a share of GDP could rise significantly from its current level of around 4%, potentially doubling in the next few years. Connolly said ordinary Russians would feel the impact but the state could comfortably pay for the war effort, even if its economy is plunged into recession. If necessary it could commandeer resources like fuel from state-owned companies. The more pressing question, he said, was the level of casualties and the difficulty of sustaining a war involving up to 150,000 troops at a time. Russia has so far acknowledged only 1,351 troops killed and 3,825 wounded, although Ukraine and Western governments believe the toll is many times higher. Its army and airborne troops have a combined strength of about 325,000. Eventually, Connolly said, it may have to take the politically unpopular decision to dip into its reserves, which the IISS estimates to number 2 million men under 50 with military service within the past five years. ""If you’ve got 150,000 committed to Ukraine, you’ve got half of your effective army currently in combat operations, many of which have experienced significant losses,"" Connolly said. ""So they’re going to need to replace, they’re going to need to rotate them. They're using their entire army, basically - or they will be if this goes on for very much longer.""

4/13/2022,"STORY: Ukraine officials said Tuesday (April 12) it was checking reports chemical weapons were used by Russian forces in the besieged port city of Mariupol. Hours earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy referred to the possibility in his nightly video address. ""Today we heard a statement from the occupiers confirming they are preparing for a new stage in their terror against us and our defenders. One of the spokespeople of the invaders said they are considering using chemical weapons against the defenders of Mariupol. We take it very seriously. I want to remind world leaders that a possible use of chemical weapons had been already discussed by the Russian military. At the time it meant the reaction to the Russian aggression should have been harsher and faster."" Zelenskiy did not provide any other detail on the claim. The Russian defense ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. British defense minister James Heappey said it was trying to verify the report. ""We are working urgently to understand whether or not chemical weapons have been used and if they have, as the foreign secretary has said, the people responsible will be held to account. The use of chemical weapons is abhorrent; it does cross a line and all options are on the table for how we would respond."" Should the reports be confirmed, it would mark a dangerous new development in the conflict, which is now firmly focused on the east of the country. The battle for the key port town of Mariupol is reaching a decisive phase, with Ukrainian marines holed up in the Azovstal industrial district. Russian victory there would create the land corridor it's been seeking between areas it holds to the west and east. Civilians continued to flee from areas of eastern Ukraine on Tuesday ahead of the anticipated Russian offensive.

4/13/2022,"The general manager of a Kentucky steakhouse said his restaurant has been flooded with complaints after it put up a Ukraine flag outside its business. Colton’s Steak House & Grill, located in Bardstown, previously displayed two Texas flags on the exterior of the restaurant, but switched one to a Ukraine flag shortly after the country was invaded by Russia. Residents of the rural Kentucky town thought the restaurant had replaced an American flag, not a Texas flag. “People start sending me screenshots and reading hateful sentiments to me from some local Facebook groups,” the general manager said in a Facebook post. “Shortly after that people are calling the store asking me why we replaced the American flag.” To remedy the situation, Colton’s replaced its other Texas flag with an American flag. The Ukraine flag has special meaning to Ben Ashlock, the general manager of the restaurant. He told WDRB he adopted a son from the eastern European country and has friends there. “I’ll check on them every day,” Ashlock said, according to WDRB. “I mean, every day and ... they’re so discouraged over there right now.” Ukraine has been at war with Russia for nearly two months, and thousands are believed to have been killed. Ashlock said he displayed the Ukraine flag as a way to support the country and show its concern, according to WDRB. “I’m grateful. I’m hurt. I’m hopeful.

In a video posted on Twitter Sunday, a soldier can be seen taking apart what the ministry says is an Orlan-10 drone that crashed on Ukrainian soil. Insider was unable to independently verify when or where the footage was taken. In the video, the soldier is first seen pointing out that the drone's camera is a generic handheld Canon DSLR that has its main navigation button glued down to make sure it doesn't accidentally switch modes. The soldier then says the camera has been secured in place with a strip of adhesive tape. —ArmyInform (@armyinformcomua) April 10, 2022 The soldier then points out that the cap of the drone's fuel tank appears to have been made with the top and lid of a plastic water bottle.

""We even thought of sending this 'cosmic' technology to our Western partners.""

The Orlan-10 usually carries a thermal-vision camera, photo camera, video camera, radio transmitter, and retransmitter, a spokesperson for Ukraine's Security Service said in 2014. Ukraine said it had shot down a number of Russian Orlan-10 drones since Russia's invasion began on February 24.

4/13/2022,"By Josh Smith SEOUL (Reuters) -The USS Abraham Lincoln strike group is operating in waters off the Korean peninsula, the U.S. Navy said on Tuesday, amid tensions over North Korea's missile launches and concerns that it could soon resume testing nuclear weapons. ""The Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group is conducting bilateral operations with the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force in the Sea of Japan,"" Commander Hayley Sims, a spokesperson for the Japan-based U.S. Seventh Fleet, said in a statement. This is the first time since 2017 that a carrier group has deployed to the waters between South Korea and Japan, and comes as U.S. officials are increasingly concerned that North Korea could carry out an underground nuclear test in the coming days. Sims said the carrier was conducting ""routine bilateral operations"" to reassure our allies and partners of the U.S. commitment to maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific. ""Our training enhances the credibility of conventional deterrence by demonstrating the strength of our bilateral partnerships,"" she added. On March 15 the USS Abraham Lincoln led military exercises in the Yellow Sea, launching its F-35 stealth fighters and other jets in what the U.S. military said was a demonstration in response to the increased pace and scale of North Korea's ballistic missile launches. Last month North Korea conducted a full test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) for the first time since 2017. During the last major flurry of ICBM and nuclear tests in 2017 the USS Ronald Reagan, Theodore Roosevelt and Nimitz, and their multi-ship strike groups, deployed to the Sea of Japan, also known in Korea as the East Sea, in a show of force. Advisers to South Korea's president-elect sought redeployment of U.S. strategic assets, such as aircraft carriers, nuclear bombers and submarines, to the Korean peninsula during talks held on a visit to Washington last week. South Korea's defence ministry said it was aware that the carrier group was in international waters but declined to comment further. North Korea has previously criticised U.S. military drills as a rehearsal for war, and said they increase tensions.

It comes as public support for joining the military alliance almost doubled in the two countries since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began.

Russian opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza Jr, who was twice taken ill in incidents he suspected were poisonings, has been detained in Moscow by police, a prominent opposition figure said on Monday. Ilya Yashin said on Twitter that Mr Kara-Murza was detained near his Moscow residence. It was unclear whether he had been charged. Mr Kara-Murza, pictured below, was hospitalised with poisoning symptoms twice, in 2015 and 2017. A journalist and associate of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, who was shot and killed in 2015, and oligarch-turned-dissident Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Mr Kara-Murza nearly died from kidney failure in the first incident. He suspects he was poisoned but no cause has been determined. He was taken to a hospital with a sudden, similar illness in 2017 and put into a medically induced coma. His wife said doctors confirmed that he was poisoned. Volodymyr Zelensky said in his daily video address on Monday night that Russia forces could use chemical weapons in Ukraine – but he did not say that chemical weapons have been already used. It comes amid unconfirmed reports on Monday which have suggested that chemical weapons were used in the besieged southern Ukrainian port of Mariupol. Manuel Fontaine, Unicef's director of emergency programmes, has warned the UN's Security Council that more than a million Ukrainian children are at risk of not having enough to eat. ""The situation is even worse in cities like Mariupol and Kherson, where children and their families have now gone weeks without running water and sanitation services, a regular supply of food, and medical care,"" she said. The Azov regiment said on Monday that Russian forces appeared to have used chemical weapons in Mariupol. The regiment said: ""Russian occupation forces used a poisonous substance of unknown origin against Ukrainian military and civilians in the city of Mariupol, which was dropped from an enemy drone. ""The victims have respiratory failure... the effects of the unknown substance are being clarified."" The claim could not immediately be verified but it came after Eduard Basurin, a spokesman for the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, told Russian state television that the Kremlin's forces might resort to chemical weapons to finish the job. Three people were killed and eight civilians were wounded on Monday by Russian strikes on the eastern Ukrainian Donetsk region, the region’s governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said in a post on Telegram. The number has not been independently verified. UN officials have called for an investigation into violence against women during the war in Ukraine and urged countries to offer women and children in the country more protection. Sima Bahous, director of the UN women’s agency, said during a meeting with the Security Council on Monday: ""This war must stop. Now... We are increasingly hearing of rape and sexual violence. These allegations must be independently investigated to ensure justice and accountability"". She added: “Mass displacement with the large presence of conscripts and mercenaries, and the brutality displayed against Ukrainian civilians, has raised all red flags"". The bodies of seven people have been found in the rubble of two destroyed high-rise apartment blocks in the town of Borodianka, near Kyiv, Ukrainian state emergency services have said. More than 200 emergency service workers have been searching to find missing residents since Ukraine regained control of the town, after Russian forces began retreating from the region last month. The seven dead pushed the total death toll at the buildings to 19 people. A total of 4,354 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities through humanitarian corridors on Monday, including 556 from Mariupol, Ukraine's deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in a post on Telegram. France will expel six Russian diplomats suspected of working as spies, the foreign ministry said on Monday. ""Six Russian agents operating under diplomatic cover whose activities were found to be contrary to our national interests have been declared persona non grata,"" the ministry said in a statement. It said the DGSI domestic intelligence service had revealed on April 10 after a long investigation ""a clandestine operation carried out by the Russian intelligence services on our territory"". Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said on Twitter that the DGSI ""had thwarted a network of Russian clandestine agents who worked against our interests"". A Russian teenage karting star was sacked by his team for appearing to give a Nazi salute after winning a race. An investigation was also launched into the “unacceptable conduct” of Artem Severiukhin, 15, who burst out laughing after beating his chest twice and thrusting an open palm into the air following the opening round of Karting European Championship in Portugal on Sunday. The incident took place on the podium during a rendition of the Italian national anthem, with Severiukhin having competed under that country’s flag after Russia’s own flag and anthem were banned from world sport over its invasion of Ukraine. After footage of the ceremony was posted online, his Swedish team, Ward Racing, said: “Ward Racing is deeply in shame of the pilot’s behaviour which it condemns in the strongest possible terms... “Ward Racing sees no possibility for continued cooperation with Artem Severiukhin and will proceed with terminating his racing contract.” Read the full story here Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said he has repeatedly urged Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to meet directly to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. During a video call with US President with Joe Biden, Modi said the war is ""worrying"" and condemned the killing of civilians. ""We hope that the ongoing discussions between Russia and Ukraine will lead to peace,"" he said. ""We have also emphasised the security of civilians in Ukraine and unhindered humanitarian supply and assistance to them."" President Biden previously called India's response to Russia's invasion ""shaky"", as it has so far refused to strongly criticise the Kremlin at the UN and is yet to impose economic sanctions.

""The mountain of wounded makes up almost half of the brigade. Those whose limbs are not torn off return to battle. ""The infantry was all killed and the shooting battles are now conducted by artillerymen, anti-aircraft gunners, radio operators, drivers and cooks. Even the orchestra."" The brigade added that it was bracing for “death for us, and captivity for the rest” after doing ""everything possible and impossible” to regain control of the port city. More than 1,000 civilians and over 700 soldiers are being held in prisons in Russia or by pro-Russian separatists, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk has said. In an interview with Reuters, Vereshchuk said she was particularly concerned about more than 500 women prisoners, who were facing regular humiliation and abuse such as having their heads shaved or being made to stand and undress. She said she was also aware of cases of rape. ""They want us to be scared. They want us to cry and to be victims. But we aren't.

French President Emmanuel Macron said on Monday that he was prepared to travel to Kyiv or any other city in Ukraine only if he felt his visit was ""useful"". ""I am ready to go anywhere and even to Kyiv if it could be useful, if it would help start a dialogue,"" Macron told the BFM television network. So many members of the Russian elite are under western sanctions now that it’s a badge of honor – as these cards apparently from a dinner with Sergei Lavrov at dinner attest, as posted by RT’s editor.The options are SANCTIONED (with the big red tick) and NOT YET https://t.co/EnNfKcolmr — max seddon (@maxseddon) April 11, 2022 Vladimir Putin has thrown a top spy chief in prison amidst concern over apparent leaks to the US about Russia’s plans in Ukraine, according to reports. A report on Monday suggested that Colonel General Sergei Beseda, the head of the FSB’s foreign intelligence unit, has been sent to Moscow’s high-security Lefortovo prison, which is typically used for those suspected of treason. In the weeks preceding the invasion, US media repeatedly quoted intelligence sources that seemed to have a unique insight into the Kremlin’s preparations for the upcoming war against Ukraine. Andrei Soldatov, a well-respected journalist and author known for his work covering Russian intelligence, quoted several unnamed sources who said that Col Gen Beseda, 68, had been transferred to Lefortovo after he was detained and placed under house arrest last month on suspicion of embezzlement. Read the full story here The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) told the EU on Monday that current and future sanctions imposed on Russia could create a devastating oil supply shock that would be impossible to replace. ""We could potentially see the loss of more than 7 million barrels per day of Russian oil and other liquids exports, resulting from current and future sanctions or other voluntary actions,"" OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said, according to a copy of his speech seen by Reuters. ""Considering the current demand outlook, it would be nearly impossible to replace a loss in volumes of this magnitude."" Russia's defence ministry said Ukraine's government was being instructed by the US and Britain to create false evidence of Russian violence against civilians. ""The United States, which has many years of experience in organising provocations with human victims, continues its campaign to create and promote false 'evidence',"" the ministry said. It added: ""New false staged provocations accusing the armed forces of the Russian Federation of allegedly cruel treatment of the population of Ukraine are being prepared by the Kyiv regime under the leadership of British special services on the territory of the Sumy region."" Images and reports from Ukrainian towns like Bucha and Mariupol - that show mass graves, targeting and killings of civilians and destroyed civilian infrastructure - are increasingly being viewed as proof that Russia has committed war crimes in the country. Kharkiv came under heavy shelling on Monday, causing multiple casualties including one child, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said in a televised interview. Terekhov added that Ukrainian forces were focused and ready to defend the city. ""There is no panic in the city,"" Terekhov said. The regional governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region has said 92 people were wounded in the attack on Kramatorsk railway station in Donetsk on Friday, including 17 children. 57 people were killed in the attack. Writing on Telegram, the governor said that four adults and two children had also been discharged from hospital in the region and sent to a hospital in the Dnipropetrovsk region for further treatment. Three Russian regions bordering Ukraine announced they were stepping up security measures on Monday over concerns about ""possible provocations"" from Ukrainian forces. The authorities in the Belgorod, Voronezh and Bryansk regions announced they were increasing security and urged citizens to be more vigilant. ""During the special operation by Russian forces on the territory of Ukraine, the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic, issues pertaining to anti-terrorist security have become more pressing due to possible provocations from Ukrainian nationalists,"" said Alexander Gusev, the governor of Voronezh, which borders Ukraine's Luhansk region. Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of Belgorod, said it would implement additional security measures until April 25 to counter terrorist threats. The Russian journalist who defied Vladimir Putin by denouncing the Ukraine invasion live on television has been hired by a German newspaper. The German newspaper Welt announced that it had hired Marina Ovsyannikova as a “freelance correspondent” covering Russia and Ukraine on Monday. Ms Ovsyannikova, a trusted and senior producer for Russian state television, stunned authorities when she interrupted a live broadcast to protest against the war last month. She shouted “Stop the war” and held up a placard that read: “No war. Don’t believe the propaganda. You are being lied to.” “At a crucial moment, Marina Ovsyannikova had the courage to confront Russian viewers with an unembellished view of reality,” Ulf Poschardt, editor-in-chief of Welt, said. “In doing so, she defended the most important journalistic ethics – despite the threat of state repression. I am excited to be working with her.” Read the full story here Russia is responsible for a growing global food crisis because its war in Ukraine has destroyed wheat stocks and prevented ships from carrying grain abroad, the EU's top diplomat said on Monday. ""They are causing scarcity. They are bombing Ukrainian cities and provoking hunger in the world. They are provoking hunger in our world,"" Josep Borrell told a media conference after chairing a meeting of EU foreign ministers. Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer has said his in-person meeting with Vladimir Putin on Monday was ""not friendly"" and ""tough"". In a statement released by his office, Nehammer said: ""This is not a friendly meeting. ""The conversation with President Putin was very direct, open and tough"". He added that he hoped to help bring an end to the war or improve conditions for civilians still in the country. Nehammer is the first EU leader to meet with Putin face-to-face since the start of the invasion of Ukraine. The US believes that Russia has started reinforcing and resupplying its troops in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, a senior defense official said on Monday. However, the official, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said the US did not believe that this meant the start of a new offensive in the region. Denmark will purchase 2 million iodine tablets to protect people in the event of a nuclear accident close to the country, the country's Health Agency said on Monday. ""The developments of Covid-19 over the past two years has shown us that it is important to be prepared. The war in Ukraine has shown us that the world is unpredictable,"" the agency said. Health minister Magnus Heunicke said that Denmark is more than 900km from the nearest nuclear plants in Ukraine and is currently at no concrete risk. Iodine is believed to protect the body against conditions such as thyroid cancer that have been caused by radioactive exposure, with concerns about the war in Ukraine having resulted in stockpiling of the drug across Europe. The 2m tablets would be provided to high-risk groups, such as children, pregnant and breastfeeding women and emergency workers up to the age of 40. Volodymyr Zelensky has said he believes ""tens of thousands"" of people have been killed in the besieged city of Mariupol. Speaking to South Korea's National Assembly by video link, the Ukrainian President said Russia had ""completely destroyed"" the southern port city which has witnessed some of the fiercest fighting of the war. ""The Russians completely destroyed Mariupol and burned it to ashes. At least tens of thousands of Mariupol citizens must have been killed.” The estimate has not yet been independently verified. Russia will not pause its military operation in Ukraine ahead of peace talks, the Foreign Ministry said on Monday. Kremlin officials have said that peace talks with Ukraine are not progressing as quickly as they wanted, and have accused the West of stoking further tensions – and hindering negotiations – by accusing Vladimir Putin of committing war crimes. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said he expected peace talks with Kyiv to continue, but warned that Moscow did not plan on halting its assault while they were being carried out. He said: ""After we became convinced that the Ukrainians were not planning to reciprocate, a decision was made that during the next rounds of talks, there would be no pause [in military action] so long as a final agreement is not reached.” North Korea has criticised the UN's decision to suspend Russia from its Human Rights Council over the war in Ukraine. A government statement said: ""What the US is after... is to isolate the independent countries, and forces challenging them at the international arena, so as to maintain its illegal and inhumane US-led hegemonic order"". The statement added that international organisations should not be ""abused"" as a way for the US to exert political pressure on other countries. North Korea was among 24 countries that voted against the suspension. The US has said reports of a Russian general nicknamed the 'Butcher of Syria' being enlisted to oversee the war in Ukraine is ""consistent"" with its military policy. General Alexander Dvornikov, 60, previously led Russian military operations in Syria, where its forces have been accused of purposefully targeting civilians. US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said he believes Dvornikov's appointment in Ukraine shows that Russia is planning to continue with a ""scorched earth"" policy approach. ""We've seen atrocities and war crimes and mass killing and horrifying and shocking images from towns like Bucha and rocket attacks on Kramatorsk,"" he said. ""I think this is an indication that we will see more of that."" General David Petraeus, a former director of the CIA, said: ""The Russians were known in Syria, basically for...'depopulating' areas. That's what they did to Aleppo. That’s what they did to other areas. And I think we can expect that"". A major river crossing outside Kyiv which was destroyed early in the war with Russia has been restored, Ukrainian officials have said. The Romanivka bridge over the River Irpin was one of several bridges destroyed by Ukrainian forces to hinder the Russian advance on the capital. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, an aide to the presidential office, said on Telegram that the temporary bridge took five days to rebuild. The bridge connects the towns of Bucha, Irpin, Hostomel and others with Kyiv. Ukraine is expecting Russia to launch a major offensive in the east of the country ""soon"", Ukrainian defence ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk said at a briefing today. ""The enemy has almost finished preparation for assault on the east, the attack will begin soon,"" he said. The Archbishop of York has condemned his Russian Orthodox counterpart, accusing him of not speaking ""in the name of Christ"" by supporting the war in Ukraine, reports Gabriella Swerling. The Most Rev Stephen Cottrell accused Patriarch Kirill, leader of the Russian Orthodox Church in Moscow, of failing to “condemn this war”. On Sunday, Patriarch Kirill called on people to rally around authorities as Moscow pursues its military intervention in Ukraine. The 75-year-old leader has previously made statements defending Moscow's actions in Ukraine and views the war as a bulwark against a decadent and liberal Western culture. Last month the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, urged Patriarch Kirill to publicly call for peace. However the Archbishop of York has now also waded into the debate regarding the Russian faith leader for the first time, and directly condemned him for supporting the war. The illegal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine is continuing.  The map below is the latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 11 April 2022 Find out more about the UK government's response: https://t.co/nZAHBJopVq🇺🇦 #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 pic.twitter.com/1fvMme61uN — Ministry of Defence 🇬🇧 (@DefenceHQ) April 11, 2022 Hungary plans to pay for Russian gas in euros through Gazprombank, which will then convert the payment into roubles to meet a new requirement set by Vladimir Putin, the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said today. Putin has warned Europe it risks having gas supplies cut unless it pays in roubles as he seeks retaliation over Western sanctions for Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Under the scheme, Hungarian energy group MVM's subsidiary, CEE Energy, would pay an upcoming bill in euros, which Gazprombank would convert into roubles and then transfer to Russia's Gazprom Export, Mr Szijjarto told a news conference. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said last week that Hungary was prepared to pay roubles for Russian gas, breaking ranks with the EU which has sought a united front in opposing Moscow's demand for payment in the currency. ""As for paying in roubles, we have a solution that does not violate any sanctions but at the same time it secures Hungary's gas supply,"" Mr Szijjarto said. Croatia has told 24 Russian embassy staff to leave over Russia's invasion of Ukraine and ""brutal aggression"", the foreign ministry said in a statement, following similar moves by other EU countries. The 24 included 18 diplomats, it said. The ministry said that the Russian ambassador was summoned in a protest over the ""brutal aggression on Ukraine and numerous crimes committed (there)"". ""The Russian party was informed about the reduction of administrative-technical staff of the Russian Federation's embassy in Zagreb,"" the statement said. Russia will not pause its military operation in Ukraine for subsequent rounds of peace talks, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said today Russian officials say peace talks with Ukraine are not progressing as rapidly as they would like, and have accused the West of trying to derail negotiations by raising war crimes allegations against Russian troops in Ukraine, which Moscow denies. Speaking in an interview with Russian state television, Mr Lavrov said he saw no reason not to continue talks with Ukraine but insisted Moscow would not halt its military operation when the sides convene again. Mr Lavrov said that Vladimir Putin had ordered a suspension of military action during the first round of talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators in late February but that Moscow's position had changed since. ""After we became convinced that the Ukrainians were not planning to reciprocate, a decision was made that during the next rounds of talks, there would be no pause (in military action) so long as a final agreement is not reached,"" Mr Lavrov said. Nearly 45,000 more Ukrainian refugees have fled in the last 24 hours, the UN said today, although many were trapped in their regions or were staying put hoping the war will end soon. The UN refugee agency UNHCR said 4,547,735 Ukrainians had fled the country since the Russian invasion on February 24 - a figure up 44,781 on Sunday's update. The Prime Minister was in Kyiv for around five hours during his visit on Saturday, Downing Street has said. He started by meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky for an hour, followed by a 30-minute walk to Independence Square, according to a No 10 spokeswoman. ""On arrival in Kyiv, the PM and President Zelensky met for an hour - this was a meeting just with the two of them. They then went on a 30 minute walk together to Independence Square,"" she said. Upon return, they held a further full bilateral meeting over dinner, the spokeswoman added. The pair had a starter of goats cheese salad and chicken soup, followed by a main of roast beef and cherry dumplings for dessert. Asked who accompanied the PM on the visit, the spokeswoman said: ""It was a very small delegation. I believe it was one member of his private office and then security."" She said Boris Johnson was in Kyiv for ""around five hours"". Lithuania wants the Nato battalions in the Baltic countries to be expanded into brigades, the country's defence ministry said in a statement on Monday. A brigade consists of several battalions of troops. ""Lithuania, together with other countries on the eastern flank of Nato, is seeking to strengthen the battle groups of the Nato Enhanced Forward Presence into forward presence brigades,"" Defence Minister Arvydas Anusauskas said. A visit by Austria's chancellor to Moscow today is aimed at mitigating ""the humanitarian hell in Ukraine"", notably by pleading for ""humanitarian corridors"", his foreign minister said. Chancellor Karl Nehammer is to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, becoming the first European leader to visit Moscow since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on February 24. While ""this is not an EU-mandated trip"", Mr Nehammer did inform key EU leaders beforehand, Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg told reporters in Luxembourg. Mr Nehammer believed it was necessary to ""leave no stone unturned"" in trying to alleviate the brutal conditions faced by Ukrainians, Mr Schallenberg said. Ukrainian forces are preparing for a ""last battle"" to control the southern port of Mariupol, besieged by Russians since the invasion, marines in the city said today. ""Today will probably be the last battle, as the ammunition is running out,"" the 36th marine brigade of the Ukrainian armed forces said on Facebook. ""It's death for some of us, and captivity for the rest,"" it added, saying it had been ""pushed back"" and ""surrounded"" by the Russian army. It said it had been defending the port for 47 days and ""did everything possible and impossible"" to retain control of the city. French police officers have arrived in Ukraine to help the country investigate alleged Russian war crimes after hundreds of civilian bodies were discovered in towns around Kyiv, the French ambassador to Ukraine said. ""Proud to welcome to Lviv the detachment of technical and scientific gendarmes who came to assist their comrades in investigations of war crimes committed near Kyiv,"" Etienne de Poncins said on Twitter. ""France is the first to provide such help. They will start work tomorrow."" He posted a photo of around 20 uniformed investigators standing by a mobile laboratory van in the western city of Lviv. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz welcomes the meeting of his Austrian counterpart Karl Nehammer and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow and supports any diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine, a government spokesperson said today. Mr Nehammer said he will meet Putin on Monday, adding that he hoped to help build bridges between Russia and Ukraine and stop the ""war of aggression"". The Kremlin claimed that the possible accession of Sweden and Finland to the Nato military alliance would not bring stability to Europe. ""We have repeatedly said that the alliance remains a tool geared towards confrontation and its further expansion will not bring stability to the European continent,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call when asked about the possibility of Sweden and Finland joining Nato. A senior US State Department official said last week that the prospect of Finland and Sweden joining Nato was part of the discussion between foreign ministers from the military alliance in Brussels. Russian-backed separatists in Donetsk will intensify their battle against Ukrainian forces, the head of the Donetsk rebel region said today. ""Now the operation will be intensified,"" Denis Pushilin, head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, was quoted as saying by the Russian news agency RIA. ""The more we delay, the more the civilian population simply suffers, being held hostage by the situation. We have identified areas where certain steps need to be accelerated,"" Mr Pushilin said. North Korean state media have again hurled colourful insults at US President Joe Biden, calling him “an old man in his senility” after he accused Russia’s leader of war crimes in Ukraine, reports Simina Mistreanu. The personal attack came after Mr Biden last week called for Vladimir Putin to be tried for war crimes over civilian killings in the Ukrainian city of Bucha. “The US chief executive spoke ill of the Russian president with groundless data,” said a commentary carried by the official KCNA news agency over the weekend. Mr Biden was not named directly in the piece. “The conclusion could be that there is a problem in his intellectual faculty and that his reckless remarks are just a show of imprudence of an old man in his senility,” said the commentary. “Gloomy, it seems, is the future of the US with such a feeble man in power.” Russian former reporter Ivan Safronov said ahead of the resumption of his treason trial on Monday that he plans to vigorously fight the charges against him and does not fear the prospect of being jailed. Mr Safronov, who covered military affairs for the Vedomosti and Kommersant newspapers before becoming an aide to the head of Russia's space agency two months before his arrest in July 2020, faces up to 20 years in prison if found guilty. He denies accusations of passing military secrets about Russian arms sales in the Middle East and Africa to the Czech Republic, a Nato member, while he worked as a reporter in 2017, calling them ""a complete travesty of justice and common sense"". His detention sent a chill through Russia's media landscape, where controls were already tight and have been tightened further since Russia invaded Ukraine in February. His trial resumes behind closed doors later today. The Kremlin said that Russia had the resources to pay its debt so there was no objective reason for a default. ""There can only be a technical, man-made default,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. ""There are no objective reasons for such a default. Russia has everything it needs to fulfil all its obligations,"" Mr Peskov said. Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer's visit to meet Vladimir Putin today is meant to tell the Russian president the truth about the war in Ukraine, Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg said. ""It makes a difference to be face to face and tell him what the reality is: that this president has de facto lost the war morally"", Mr Schallenberg said upon his arrival for a meeting with EU counterparts in Luxembourg. ""It should be in his own interest that someone tells him the truth. I think it is important and we owe it to ourselves if we want to save human lives."" German newspaper Die Welt said it has hired Marina Ovsyannikova, the Russian journalist who protested against Moscow's military action in Ukraine during a prime-time news broadcast on state TV. Ms Ovsyannikova, 43, ""is now a freelance correspondent for Die Welt, reporting from Ukraine and Russia, among other places"", the newspaper said in a statement. She will write for the newspaper as well as being a regular contributor to its TV news channel, it said. Ms Ovsyannikova, an editor at Russia's Channel One television, barged onto the set of its flagship Vremya evening news in March holding a poster reading ""No War"" in English. The MoD claims Moscow is seeking to ‘bolster troop numbers with personnel discharged from military service since 2012’, reports James Kilner. Russia has suffered such heavy losses in Ukraine it is now calling up soldiers who have been retired for up to a decade, according to Western intelligence. The Ministry of Defence said on Sunday that Moscow was seeking to ""bolster troop numbers with personnel discharged from military service since 2012."" In the latest release of Western intelligence likely to embarrass the Kremlin, the MoD said Moscow is also turning to recruits from the separatist region of Transnistria in Moldova to cover ""mounting losses."" Read the full story here. Tens of thousands of people have likely been killed in Russia's assault on the southeastern city of Mariupol, Volodymyr Zelensky said on Monday. ""Mariupol has been destroyed, there are tens of thousands of dead, but even despite this, the Russians are not stopping their offensive,"" the Ukrainian President said in a video address to South Korean lawmakers. The figure has not been independently verified. Norway will extend its current Nato enhanced Forward Presence (eFP) troop deployment in Lithuania meaning all of its 200 troops will remain until August following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Norwegian defence ministry said today. The deployment was increased in February by around 50 troops on a three-month basis, and this deployment has been extended by three more months. Norway said it also plans to contribute troops to the eFP beyond August, but did not say how many would be deployed. Germany sees ""massive indications of war crimes"" in Ukraine, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said today. ""We have massive indications of war crimes,"" she told reporters before a meeting with fellow European ministers in Luxembourg. ""In the end, the courts will have to decide, but for us, it is central to secure all evidence."" ""As the German federal government, we have already made it clear that there will be a complete phase-out of fossil fuels, starting with coal, then oil and gas, and so that this can be implemented jointly in the European Union, we need a joint, coordinated plan to completely phase out fossil fuels to be able to withdraw as a European Union,"" Ms Baerbock added. The scale of the job is enormous, as 1,200 civilians have been killed in towns around Kyiv, with Ukraine accusing Russia of murdering many of them, reports Campbell MacDiarmid from Bucha. As a cold rain began falling on the hallowed ground of the Bucha churchyard on Sunday, Ruslan Kravchenko ordered his gravediggers back into the trench to resume a most unholy exhumation. The hazmat-suited workers, one wearing a respirator, dug quickly with shovels before leaning down to grab the day’s first corpse by the lapels of a blue coat, hauling until the sticky earth released its grip and the man’s torso came lurching to a sitting position. Wearing a vest emblazoned with “war crimes prosecutor”, Mr Kravchenko stood out of the rain under a white awning with a knot of policemen holding clipboards and a camcorder, carefully recording the scene. “So far we’ve removed the bodies of 21 civilians,” Mr Kravchenko said of the previous two days’ work. “Some of the bodies had signs of torture, some had broken bones, some had their legs tied together.” Read the full story here. Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said that the European Commission was working on details of an oil embargo on Russia as part of a possible next sanctions package, but that nothing has been decided. He said he hoped it could be agreed by the EU's 27 states as soon as possible but gave no further details. Russia has destroyed S-300 anti-aircraft missile systems which had been supplied to Ukraine by a European country, Russia's defence ministry said on Monday. The ministry said that Russian sea-launched Kalibr missiles on Sunday destroyed four S-300 launchers which were concealed in a hangar on the outskirts of the Ukrainian city of Dnipro. Russia said 25 Ukrainian troops were hit in the attack. It not say which European country had supplied the S-300 systems. Nine humanitarian corridors to evacuate people from Ukraine's besieged eastern regions have been agreed for Monday between Kyiv and Moscow, including five in the Luhansk region, Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. The planned corridors include one for people evacuating by private transport from the city of Mariupol, Ms Vereshchuk added. George Eustice, the Environment Secretary, said the UK ""would be making available more defensive military equipment to the Ukrainians"" following Boris Johnson's surprise visit to Kyiv on Saturday. Mr Eustice told Sky News: ""I think the whole world is coming together to show solidarity and support of Ukraine about what's happened. That's why the Prime Minister announced yesterday that we would be making available more defensive military equipment to the Ukrainians, additional missiles and so on. ""We've been giving them support from the beginning, but also it's so important that we remain absolutely resolute when it comes to sanctions against Russia. ""We must ensure that Putin cannot prevail on this. The Ukrainians have been incredibly brave, I think President Zelensky has led his people well and we've all been humbled really by the acts of bravery we've seen but also deeply shocked about some of those terrible scenes that we're seeing coming out now from the cities from which Russia's withdrawn."" French bank Societe Generale has agreed to sell its stake in Rosbank and the Russian lender’s insurance subsidiaries to Interros Capital, a firm linked to the billionaire Vladimir Potanin. The move addresses mounting pressure on SocGen to cut ties with Russia after its invasion of Ukraine and ends its more than 15-year investment in Rosbank. ""With this agreement ... the group would exit in an effective and orderly manner from Russia, ensuring continuity for its employees and clients"", the French bank said on Monday. The deal, pending regulatory approval, would result in a write-off of about 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) and an exceptional non-cash item with no impact on SocGen's capital ratio, it said. Rosbank will be transferred back to the empire of Mr Potanin, who is the biggest shareholder in Norilsk Nickel, the world's largest producer of palladium and refined nickel. More European Union sanctions on Russia are an option, the bloc's top diplomat Josep Borrell said today when asked if the EU was ready to consider a Russian oil embargo in response to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. ""Sanctions are always on the table,"" Mr Borrell told reporters as he arrived for a meeting with EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg. ""Ministers will discuss which are the further steps,"" he added. Russian state-owned gas producer Gazprom continued to supply natural gas to Europe via Ukraine on Monday in line with requests from European consumers, the Russian news agency Interfax reported. Requests stood at 95 million cubic metres for April 11, Interfax reported, citing Ukraine's gas pipeline operator. The symbolic trampling of Ukrainian identity came as locals tell the Telegraph of an increasing level of repression and criminality, report Verity Bowman and James Kilner. Russian soldiers have torn down the Ukrainian flag flying above Kherson's main administrative building and raised Russia's tricolour, reflecting increasingly aggressive rhetoric coming from the Kremlin that Ukraine should be wiped off the map. On Sunday, an online video emerged showing a handful of men standing in the central square in Kherson waving Russian flags and looking bored. Yuriy Sobolevskiy, the deputy mayor of Kherson, said that the men were probably paid to be there and on his Facebook page he said the Russian army was intimidating locals and threatening to arrest people at anti-Russian rallies. “Many people are intimidated, many have left the region at their own peril and risk,” Mr Sobolevskiy wrote. “Many have simply disappeared, and it is impossible to establish what happened to them today.” Read the full story here. Russian shelling has continued in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, with Ukrainian forces repelling several assaults, resulting in the destruction of Russian tanks, vehicles and artillery equipment, the UK's Ministry of Defence tweeted this morning. Russian forces' use of phosphorous munitions in the Donetsk region also raises the possibility of their future employment in Mariupol as fighting for the city intensifies, British military intelligence said. The MoD report said that Russia's continued reliance on unguided bombs decreased their ability to discriminate when targeting and conducting strikes. This greatly increased the risk of further civilian casualties. The 2022 spring crop sowing area in Ukraine can reach 80pc of the pre-war acreage if the country manages to clear mines in northern regions, deputy agriculture minister Taras Vysotsky said today. Ukrainian agriculture officials said in February that the sowing area could fall 50pc due to the invasion, but later revised the sowing area forecast to around 70pc as Russia failed to occupy most of the country. Parts of the territory of Chernihiv and Sumy regions were occupied. After the withdrawal of Russian forces, they were heavily mined. Mr Vysotsky said that even if the areas under spring crops were reduced, Ukraine would be able to provide itself with food. Japan will begin online talks with Russia on Monday to negotiate the quota of salmon and trout Japan can catch this year, the Government said, after ties soured over the Ukraine crisis and delayed the annual exercise. A decades-old pact provides for the talks on the amount of Russian-born salmon and trout that Japan can catch each year within its own exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Usually held in March and wrapping up by the April 10 start of the fishing season, their fate had been uncertain until just a few days ago. One person close to the fishing industry told Reuters he expected talks to be tough this year, given the state of ties. ""The negotiations will start but the outcome is highly unpredictable,"" he said. New Zealand said on Monday it will deploy a C-130 Hercules and 58 personnel to Europe to further support Ukraine against Russia's invasion. The team would travel throughout Europe transporting equipment and supplies to distribution centres, but would not enter Ukraine, Defence Minister Peeni Henare said. The Government also said it would donate an extra NZ$13.1 million (£6.8 million) towards military, legal and human rights support. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said New Zealand's support was to help Ukraine repel the Russian invasion because peace in the region of Europe was essential for global stability. ""Such a blatant attack on a country's sovereignty is a threat to all of us and that's why we too have a role to play,"" Ms Ardern said. Ukraine's economic output will likely contract by a staggering 45.1pc this year as Russia's invasion has shuttered businesses, slashed exports and rendered economic activity impossible in large swaths of the country, the World Bank said. The World Bank also forecast Russia's 2022 GDP output to fall 11.2pc due to punishing financial sanctions imposed by the United States and its Western allies on Russia's banks, state-owned enterprises and other institutions. The World Bank's ""War in the Region"" economic update stated that the Eastern Europe region - comprising Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova - is forecast to show a GDP contraction of 30.7pc this year, due to shocks from the war and disruption of trade. Growth in 2022 in the Central Europe region - comprising Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Poland and Romania - will be cut to 3.5pc from 4.7pc previously due to the influx of refugees, higher commodity prices and deteriorating confidence hurting demand. For Ukraine, the World Bank report estimates that over half of the country's businesses are closed, while others are operating at well under normal capacity. The closure of Black Sea shipping from Ukraine has cut off some 90pc of the country's grain exports and half its total exports. The World Bank said the war has rendered economic activity impossible in many areas, and is disrupting agricultural planting and harvest operations. Estimates of infrastructure damage exceeding $100 billion by early March - about two-thirds of Ukraine's 2019 GDP - are well out of date ""as the war has raged on and caused further damage"". Austria's leader is planning to meet Russian president Vladimir Putin and call for an end to the Ukrainian conflict. Chancellor Karl Nehammer said he would meet Putin on Monday in Moscow for the Russian leader's first face-to-face meeting with a European Union counterpart since Russia's invasion began on February 24. ""We are militarily neutral, but (have) a clear position on the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine,"" Mr Nehammer wrote of Austria on Twitter. ""It must stop! It needs humanitarian corridors, ceasefire and full investigation of war crimes."" Ukraine's armed forces are bracing today for a new Russian offensive as powerful explosions rocked cities in the south and east, while Austria's leader planned to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin and call for an end to the conflict. Volodymyr Zelensky kept up his tireless campaign to generate international support and rally his countrymen, warning the coming week would be important and tense. ""Russia will be even more afraid. It will be afraid to lose. It will fear that the truth will have to be acknowledged,"" the Ukrainian president said in a late-night video address. ""Russian troops will move to even larger operations in the east of our state. They may use even more missiles against us, even more air bombs. But we are preparing for their actions. We will answer."" Ukraine has found more than 1,200 bodies in the Kyiv region, the scene of atrocities allegedly committed by Russian troops, as residents in the country's east braced - or fled - ahead of an expected massive offensive. Regional governor Oleg Synegubov said: ""The Russian army continues to wage war on civilians due to a lack of victories at the front."" In Dnipro, an industrial city of around one million inhabitants, a rain of Russian missiles nearly destroyed the local airport, causing an uncertain number of casualties, local authorities said. Black smoke was visible in the sky above the facility, but a plane also took off later on Sunday, suggesting its runway was still functioning. After Russia tapped a decorated general to take centralised control of the war in Ukraine, the United States' national security adviser played down the significance of the appointment. Jake Sullivan told CNN's State of the Union TV programme: ""What we have learned in the first several weeks of this war is that Ukraine will never be subjected to Russia. ""It doesn't matter which general President Putin tries to appoint.""

As Ukrainian soldiers dug in on Sunday, Russia lined up more firepower ahead of a potentially decisive showdown in eastern Ukraine that could start within days. Questions remain about the ability of Russia's depleted and demoralised forces to conquer much ground after their advance on the capital, Kyiv, was repelled by determined Ukrainian defenders. Britain's Defence Ministry reported that Russian forces were trying to compensate for mounting casualties by recalling veterans discharged in the past decade.

Russia-backed separatists have fought Ukrainian forces in the eastern Donbas region since 2014 and declared some territory there as independent. British families taking part in the Homes for Ukraine scheme say they fear refugees will die in the Russian bombing or overcrowded camps before the Home Office approves their applications. Nine in 10 applicants for the scheme are still waiting for Home Office approval for their refugees, some of whom have remained in their country despite the Russian bombardment, according to the survey of 150 British host families. Families who offer their second homes to Ukrainian refugees will get a 50 per cent council tax discount worth as much as £1,000 under new laws to be laid before Parliament on Monday. Councils will also be barred from removing the discounts of lone householders who take in refugees under the legal changes to be unveiled by Lord Harrington, the refugees minister. The moves are designed to ensure that no household is financially penalised if they take part in the Homes for Ukraine scheme. Read the full story here.

4/13/2022,"A baker allegedly stabbed a Texas artist to death and set his body on fire moments after interviewing him on Instagram live about skull-shaped pastries, according to authorities. Manuel Tellez, 45, has been charged with murder in the deadly knife attack on Anthony Moreno, whose charred remains were found in an alley footsteps near Tellez's business. Officers found Moreno’s burnt corpse at approximately 9:20 a.m. on April 3 near the 1300 block of Kings Highway, Dallas Police Department said. Police allege in an arrest affidavit obtained by Oxygen.com that the two men had just finished broadcasting an Instagram Live interview about Moreno's Mexican “sugar skull art” — often called calaveras — and Moreno texted his wife around 12:15 a.m. that he was on his way home. Tellez then allegedly walked with Moreno to an alley about two blocks away from his business, the Maroches Bakery, and stabbed him multiple times. Tellez allegedly then left, changed his clothes and returned to the crime scene just under three hours later, where police say he doused Moreno in gasoline and set the dead man’s body ablaze. Surveillance footage from a gas station, taken around 2:00 a.m., allegedly showed the baker wearing a single white latex glove — similar to one found at the crime scene — surgical mask and hat while filling a portable gas can, charging documents stated. Police say that Tellez's Kia SUV, which has identifiable rust spots on its roof, was on the tape. A neighbor's surveillance camera allegedly recorded the start of the fire in the alley at 2:58 a.m. Police say that cell phone records showed Tellez at the bakery, the alley and the gas station at each time. Tellez and Moreno knew each other through the city’s arts community — and also had a mutual “romantic interest” in an unnamed woman, the affidavit stated. According to Moreno’s family, Tellez shared a link to the slain father’s GoFundMe, which raised more than $13,000 for funeral expenses, in the days following his death. “OMG I can not believe he shared this!” his wife, Ofelia Moreno, wrote on social media, the Dallas Morning News reported. “He killed my husband and made it seem like everything was normal.”  The 52-year-old artist leaves behind three children and six grandchildren, his family said. “I forgive the man that took him, unfortunately,"" his son Tony Moreno told Dallas television station WFAA. ""I do pray for the man who took my father’s life.” The grieving son described his father as a “godly man.” “He had a way with people,” Tony Moreno added. “He had a way to talk to people and befriend people and spread love."" News of Moreno’s death also shocked Dallas’ tight-knit arts community. “My heart goes out to the families,” said Ofelia Faz Garza, a poet, who had recently given a reading at Maroches Bakery, according to the Dallas Morning News. “He was a good motivator,” artist Modesto Aceves also told the newspaper. “He always got your back.”  No additional information was immediately released regarding the active case. Investigators for the Dallas Police Department declined to comment when contacted on Monday afternoon.  Tellez, who had a court date on Friday, is being held at a Dallas County jailhouse, according to online jail records obtained by Oxygen.com. His bond was set at $1.5 million.  Tellez’s defense lawyer declined to comment on the allegations against his client when contacted by telephone on Monday afternoon. “I’m not going to offer any comment at all,” attorney Jeff Lehman told Oxygen.com.",U.S./Oxygen,"Texas Baker Allegedly Killed ‘Sugar Skull’ Artist, Burnt Body After Instagram Live Interview",https://news.yahoo.com/texas-baker-allegedly-killed-sugar-213240182.html
4/13/2022,"WASHINGTON — Patriarch Kirill, leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, has been a loyal ally of President Vladimir Putin for years. But his vociferous support of the invasion of Ukraine has drawn strong rebukes from religious leaders who say he has forsaken Christian teachings by supporting the Kremlin’s destructive campaign. In his most recent Sunday sermon, delivered at the Church of the Intercession of the Most Holy Theotokos in Moscow, Kirill told worshippers to respect official power — a message seemingly intended to bolster a military campaign that has gone badly for Russia. Once called “the politicking patriarch,” Kirill was enthroned in 2009 and is closely associated within Russia with the current political regime. “May the Lord help us all in this difficult time for our Fatherland to unite, including around the authorities,” Kirill said in the sermon. He hoped that the Russian people would maintain “the ability to repel external and internal enemies.” Kirill has been a vociferous and consistent supporter of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, despite the fact that the vast majority of Ukrainians are Eastern Orthodox. On Sunday, nearly 300 leaders of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church signed a letter accusing Kirill of “moral crimes” for his endorsement of the unprovoked attack on Ukraine, which has killed thousands of civilians. “Our position is fully consistent with the Gospel and the church tradition,” the Ukrainian clergymen wrote. “Defending the homeland from the enemy is one of the main Christian virtues.” Many Christian leaders in the West have denounced the invasion, including Pope Francis and members of Kirill’s own church. Most Russian clergy, however, share Kirill’s views. Metropolitan Mitrofan of Murmansk said the invasion of Ukraine was a battle against “the Antichrist.” Mitrofan also said the Orthodox Church in Ukraine is “not a real church,” in reference to the schism between the Ukrainian and Russian churches three years ago, angering both Putin and Kirill. Long suspected of having once been an agent of the KGB — the Soviet era security service that frequently singled out religious dissidents — Kirill is a symbol of the resurgence of the Orthodox Church under Putin, who has used religion to bolster his nationalistic, anti-Western vision. In 2013, Kirill decried same-sex marriage as “a very dangerous sign of the apocalypse.” Four years later, he criticized Western Europe for the “grave mistake” of straying from Christianity. Although Russian society has become increasingly religious since the fall of the Soviet Union, which officially embraced atheism, Kirill has not wholly escaped scrutiny. In 2012, a photograph of him wearing a $40,000 watch was airbrushed to remove the timepiece, leading to widespread derision and mockery. Two years ago, he was seen wearing a watch costing $16,000, this time without apparent concern for public backlash. When Putin decided to launch an invasion of Ukraine in late February — in what he described as an effort to “de-Nazify” the country’s government, which is led by a Jewish president — Kirill told members of the armed forces that they were on “the correct path.” He also alluded to threats mounting “on the borders of our Fatherland,” an obvious reference to Ukraine and its Western allies. A sovereign nation since 1991, Ukraine has sought to chart a course distinct from its Soviet legacy. Kyiv’s desire for autonomy has always been viewed as an affront by Putin, who first invaded Ukraine in 2014. He invaded again eight years later, expecting an easy victory, only to face protests at home and condemnation abroad. Kirill remains a key ally for an increasingly embattled Kremlin. “The Russian Orthodox Church's moral blessing of this war has been years in the making,” Russia expert Samuel Ramani of Oxford University said earlier this month. While few have been surprised by Kirill’s loyalty to Putin, his seeming lack of concern for the plight of ordinary Ukrainians has renewed criticism of his tenure. Though he has made generic calls for peace, the 75-year-old bishop has also made no secret of his true sympathies. “We have entered into a struggle that has not a physical, but a metaphysical significance,” Kirill said in early March. In a widely condemned sermon earlier this month, Kirill struck out against the West while envisioning the same fictitious unity of Slavic peoples that Putin has invoked and Ukrainians have rejected. “Today the word ‘independence’ is often applied to almost all countries of the world,” Kirill said on the same day that much of the world was encountering the images of slaughtered civilians in Bucha. “But this is wrong, because most of the countries of the world are now under the colossal influence of one force, which today, unfortunately, opposes the force of our people.” The April 3 sermon was delivered at the main cathedral of the Russian Armed Forces. Kirill did not name the malevolent force he had in mind, but Putin has blamed the United States for engineering Ukraine’s successful resistance to Russia. “We are a peace-loving country and a very peace-loving, long-suffering people who suffered from wars like few other European nations,” Kirill went on to say. “We have no desire for war or for doing something that could harm others. But we have been so educated by our entire history that we love our Fatherland and will be ready to defend it in the way that only Russians can defend their country.” The April 3 sermon led to a rebuke from a leader of the Greek Orthodox Church in the United States. “From the words and actions of Patriarch Kirill, we can conclude he has made the same bargain with Putin and his cronies. This is, indeed, a sad moment for our church, and the whole world is watching,” Archbishop Elpidophoros said in a speech the following day. Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, called for the World Council of Churches to eject Russia after the April 3 sermon. “The riot act has to be read,” Williams said in an interview with the BBC.  “When a Church is actively supporting a war of aggression, failing to condemn nakedly obvious breaches in any kind of ethical conduct in wartime, then other churches have the right to raise the question and challenge it — to say, unless you can say something effective about this, something recognizably Christian, we have to look again at your membership.” Present at the sermon Kirill delivered on Sunday were several representatives of Norilsk Nickel, the mining giant that helped construct the church where service took place.

4/13/2022,"Malaysian influencer Siew Pui Yi sparked outrage over photos of herself wearing the Vietnamese national dress without pants. Social media users accused the 23-year-old of being ""disrespectful"" towards Vietnamese culture. Siew, who has 17.5 million Instagram followers, deleted the photos and issued an apology online. A Malaysian influencer has apologized after sparking outrage in Vietnam over photos she shared of herself wearing the country's national dress — but without pants. Siew Pui Yi, who has 17.5 million followers on Instagram and 717,000 followers on Facebook, had posted several pictures of herself last week donning an ao dai, minus the pants that usually accompany the outfit's tunic top. In the photos taken in the historic Vietnamese town of Hoi An, her thong is clearly visible as she releases a flower-shaped paper lantern on the Hoai River — a traditional custom signifying a prayer for peace. The backlash against Siew was swift, with angry social media users accusing her of being ""disrespectful"" of Vietnamese culture. Hoi An's Culture and Information Department Head Tong Quoc Hung also commented on Siew's actions, noting that ""the female tourist revealing her underwear in the ancient town of Hoi An is offensive,"" per Vietnamese news outlet VnExpress. Siew has since deleted the photos, but not before screenshots of the images were circulated online. Last Wednesday, the 23-year-old issued an apology on Facebook in Vietnamese, English and Chinese. ""To my recent travel to Vietnam, there was a posting of mine that truly upset the people, and I deeply and sincerely apologize for my actions/content and the disrespect to the traditional culture of Vietnam, to which I have now taken down,"" she wrote. ""I do hope to have another opportunity to be back in Vietnam and of course, take a different approach to shooting my content! I apologize once again, and will be more sensitive to the local cultures all over the world."" Siew did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. Known for posting pictures of herself in skimpy clothing, Siew made the cover of US adult magazine Penthouse in January. In a Facebook post, Siew claimed she is the first woman from Southeast Asia to be featured on the magazine's cover.

4/13/2022,"A brigade of Ukrainian marines fighting in Mariupol said they are running out of ammunition. The 36th Brigade said they were ""dying, but fighting"" even without food and water supplies. They also said that half their group comprised a ""mountain of wounded."" A brigade of Ukrainian marines defending the city of Mariupol said on Monday that they are running out of ammunition after nearly seven weeks of fighting. ""We have been defending Mariupol for 47 days. We were bombed by airplanes, we were shot at by artillery and tanks. We kept up the defense by doing the impossible. But any resource has the potential to run out,"" said the 36th Brigade in a Facebook post. The group said they were initially equipped with guns at the beginning of the conflict, but have not received any additional ammunition since. ""For more than a month, the Marines have fought without refills of ammunition, without food, without water,"" they wrote. ""The mountain of wounded makes up almost half our crew."" ""The enemy gradually pushed us back. They surrounded us with fire, and are now trying to destroy us,"" the post read. The post noted that surviving brigade members are now defending the Azovstal iron and steelworks plant near Mariupol's port. The marines added that the men whose limbs were unbroken and ""not torn off"" had returned to the ranks to fight. With no infantrymen left, the group said that artillerymen, cooks, drivers, and even orchestra musicians have been involved in shootouts with Russian forces. ""We are dying, but fighting. But this is coming to an end,"" the post read. ""Today will be another extremely difficult fight. Ahead lies death for some, captivity for others. Dear Ukrainian people — we ask you to remember the Marines."" ""Do not talk badly about the Marines. We have done everything we could, the possible and impossible. We are FAITHFUL FOREVER,"" the post added. The marines' post came hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy estimated that ""tens of thousands"" of Ukrainians may have died in Russia's attack on Mariupol. Images captured by photojournalists in the city have shown the destruction of schools, maternity hospitals, and even a movie theater — acts that Zelenskyy has labeled ""war crimes"" that will be remembered for ""centuries to come.""

4/13/2022,"(Adds quotes from Russia and Slovakia) April 11 (Reuters) - Russia said on Monday that it had used cruise missiles to destroy S-300 anti-aircraft missile systems which had been supplied to Ukraine by an unidentified European country.
