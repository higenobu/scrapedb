12/11/2021,"Opening his Summit for Democracy this week, Joe Biden urged his guests to “stand up for the values that unite us”, including a free press. The US president boasted of his new initiative for democratic renewal, including measures to support an unfettered and independent media: “It’s the bedrock of democracy. It’s how the public stay informed and how governments are held accountable. And around the world, press freedom is under threat.” Yet the US government itself is endangering the ability of the media to bring to light uncomfortable truths and expose official crimes and cover-ups. On Friday, the high court ruled that Julian Assange can be extradited to the US, where he could face up to 175 years in prison. The decision is not only a blow for his family and friends, who fear he would not survive imprisonment in the US. It is also a blow for all those who wish to protect the freedom of the press.  The judgment overturns January’s decision by a district court that the WikiLeaks founder could not be extradited because of the substantial risk that he would kill himself, given his mental health and the conditions he would face. The US subsequently put forward a package of reassurances in its attempt to overturn that ruling, which the high court judges accepted. But the US has reserved the right to put him in a maximum security facility or to subject him to special administrative measures – which can include prolonged solitary confinement – based on his conduct. His team will appeal, and the legal process is likely to drag on for years. The focus has shifted to the heart of the matter. Regardless of Mr Assange’s wellbeing, the US should not be demanding his extradition, and the UK should not be granting it. He is charged under the Espionage Act, including with publishing classified material. The case against the 49-year-old relates to hundreds of thousands of leaked documents about the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, as well as diplomatic cables, which were made public by WikiLeaks working with the Guardian and other media organisations. They revealed horrifying abuses by the US and other governments which would not otherwise have come to light. As Agnès Callamard, secretary general of Amnesty International, has noted: “Virtually no one responsible for alleged US war crimes committed in the course of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars has been held accountable, let alone prosecuted, and yet a publisher who exposed such crimes is potentially facing a lifetime in jail.” No public interest defence is permissible under the Espionage Act. Campaigners in the US have warned that its use is a direct assault on the first amendment. And publishers outside it are equally at risk if Mr Assange is extradited; the charges relate to acts which took place when he was not in the country. The US has this week proclaimed itself the beacon of democracy in an increasingly authoritarian world. If Mr Biden is serious about protecting the ability of the media to hold governments accountable, he should begin by dropping the charges brought against Mr Assange.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the US pursuit of Julian Assange: set him free | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/10/the-guardian-view-on-the-us-pursuit-of-julian-assange-set-him-free
12/11/2021,"Mike Nesmith, who achieved global fame as a member of the pop group the Monkees, has died aged 78. “With infinite love we announce that Michael Nesmith has passed away this morning in his home, surrounded by family, peacefully and of natural causes,” his family said in a statement. “We ask that you respect our privacy at this time and we thank you for the love and light that all of you have shown him and us.”  Nesmith was the group’s guitarist, and also one of its songwriters, for tracks including The Girl I Knew Somewhere, Listen to the Band and Mary, Mary. Alongside Mickey Dolenz, Davy Jones and Peter Tork, the group had huge hits including US chart-toppers Daydream Believer and I’m a Believer, having been formed for a TV sitcom about a rock’n’roll band. Nesmith successfully auditioned for the role of “Mike” in the show, in October 1965, having begun his music career as a jobbing folk music performer in Los Angeles. The nature of the Monkees as a manufactured band became something of a millstone for the group, who fractured in the late 1960s following their psychedelic album Head. Nesmith left in 1970, following Tork’s departure in 1968.

12/11/2021,"The Bosnian Serb leader accused of risking war by breaking up Bosnia-Herzegovina has likened himself to David Cameron and his efforts to renegotiate Britain’s EU membership terms before the EU referendum. Milorad Dodik, the Serb member of the tripartite presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina, said the country’s potential collapse and the exit of the Republika Srpska entity from it was only on the cards if he was rebuffed in his demand to take back control of tax administration, the judiciary and the army.  Dodik’s comments in the Republika Srpska’s assembly, firing the starting shot of what he intends to be six months of negotiations with the Croat and Muslim Bosniak leadership over a new arrangement, came as local politicians backed a resolution under which the entity would unilaterally take back the powers if necessary. Dodik said he was willing to compromise on elements of his plans but that a new constitution would be put to a referendum and that the Republika Srpska would be pushed to “exit” if his main demands were not met. He dismissed criticism and said he was making efforts to avoid a dramatic break up. Dodik’s speech to the assembly, he said, had drawn on Cameron’s “Bloomberg speech” in 2013 in which the UK prime minister had set out demands for new terms of Britain’s membership with the EU. “In this speech, I replaced Great Britain [sic] with Republika Srpska, and Bosnia and Herzegovina with the European Union,” Dodik said. At the time, Cameron said that repatriating some powers away from the EU to Britain would lead to a new settlement that would help him win a 2017 EU referendum. Despite Dodik’s claims to be merely seeking to reverse the centralisation of powers in favour of the central Bosnian state, he faced stark criticism in the assembly even from fellow Serb nationalists about the manner in which he was pursuing his goals. Mirko Šarović, the leader of the Serb Democratic Party, the party founded by Radovan Karadžić, who is currently serving a 40-year sentence for genocide in Srebrenica, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, said Dodik posed a “direct threat to peace”. “The takeover of these competencies cannot be carried out without war”, Šarović said. The current constitution of Bosnia was established by the 1995 Dayton peace accord, which ended the bloody regional war that followed the breakup of Yugoslavia. Bosnia-Herzegovina is made up of two entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, consisting predominantly of Bosniak Muslims and Croats, and the Serbian Republika Srpska. Bosnia’s three-member presidency is held by representatives of those three main ethnic groups. Under the so-called Bonn powers of 1997, substantial powers of lawmaking were also granted to the office of the high representative (OHR) in charge of implementing the deal. Dodik has claimed that powers have become increasingly centralised, and that the OHR plays an oversized and undemocratic role in Bosnian Serb affairs. “Let’s determine at this moment what Bosnia-Herzegovina needs and what it needs to stop doing,” he told assembly members. “Entities and their parliaments should have greater significance and role because they are a true source of democracy, legitimacy and responsibility in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Bosnia-Herzegovina is moving in a direction we do not agree with. We do not allow interference in our jurisdiction.” Dodik has been banned from travelling to the US, or accessing assets under its jurisdiction since defying Bosnia’s constitutional court in 2017 by staging a referendum on celebrating Republika Srpska Day, marking the date in 1992 when Bosnian Serbs declared their own state in Bosnia. In an interview with The Guardian last month, he said he was not “indifferent” to threats of further sanctions from the US, the EU and European governments but added: “I was not elected to be a coward.” He had also claimed that a cut in funding from the EU would be made up by backing from China and Russia. Dodik visited Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin last week.",News/World news,Bosnian Serb leader likens himself to David Cameron in latest demands,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/10/bosnian-serb-leader-milorad-dodik-likens-himself-to-david-cameron
12/11/2021,"A 10-point action plan to confront the issue of concussion in sport has been published by the government, with the aim of introducing new “technological advancements” to help against injury by autumn of next year. Also included among the recommendations are plans to develop concussion protocols that will apply across UK sport, a new approach to training protocols for professional sport, and asking the Premier League to look at new forms of governance that would put player welfare on a higher footing.  The new proposals have been made in response to an inquiry into concussion in sport conducted by the digital culture media and sport committee earlier this year. At the time, the committee expressed “concern” over failures to act in the area. It called on government to take a “proactive” role in devising “a precautionary approach to risk management”. In its response, the government said the inquiry had been a “very welcome addition to this important topic”. It went on to to say that: “Concussion and the risks posed by head injury represents a cross-sport issue, and the Government believes it is necessary to bring the sport, health, education and technology sectors together to address the issue collaboratively.” Collaboration is a consistent theme throughout the government’s recommendations. It has worked with Oxford University and the charity Podium Analytics to commission new research into concussion. It will ask individual sports to convene with player associations on training protocols. It also promises “a roundtable of tech companies with an interest in finding technological innovations and solutions designed to mitigate the effects and instances of concussion in sport”, with the aim of introducing “practical improvements for players by autumn 2022”. The Guardian understands that the collaboration with the Premier League, “on a pilot scheme for clubs to embed player welfare as part of the governance of their organisations”, was first raised in a call this week, with details of the proposal yet to be determined. On announcing the measures, the sports minister Nigel Huddleston said: “Working with the sports industry, it is right that we do all we can to ensure that people are as protected as possible and the risk of head injuries are minimised. “That’s why we’re taking steps to reduce this risk and developing new, gold-standard industry protocols and focusing on emerging tech that can help build a fuller picture of the risks involved.” Peter McCabe, the chief executive of head injury charity Headway, said: “The DCMS Committee’s criticism of sport was clear, accusing it of ‘marking its own homework’ due to a lack of scrutiny from government. We are pleased to see the government has accepted most of the committee’s recommendations and that its involvement is needed to ensure sport adopts a cohesive, consistent approach to concussion in sport. “Nonetheless, this response is a little underwhelming in terms of the urgency and level of government involvement. Immediate action is required to build on the progress we’ve made to date -particularly at grassroots level where we need an evolution of attitude when it comes to head injuries in sport.”",Sport/Sport,Plan to tackle concussion in sport published by UK government,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/10/plan-to-tackle-concussion-in-sport-published-by-uk-government

12/11/2021,"Nine-month-old Ruataupare Te Ropuhina Florence Whiley-Whaipooti will grow up speaking the names of her ancestors. She will learn she comes from a line of strong Ngāti Porou women, and that her ancestor, who was a staunch tribal leader, is her name-sake. She will grow to understand that her Māori name links her to whenua (land), her whakapapa (genealogy) and her Māoritanga (culture). Ruataupare is one of an increasing number of babies in New Zealand to be given a Māori name. While Māori have never stopped giving their children indigenous names, there has been a marked increase over the past 10 years – a near doubling of Māori names registered since 2011.  Parents Julia Amua Whaipooti, who is Ngāti Porou descent, and Emma Whiley who is Pākehā (New Zealand European) chose Ruataupare’s name to ensure she is connected with her Māori identity. “It was a deliberate decision to name her after where she’s from but we also know it is political. We live in a country that actively oppressed Māori culture, naming her is statement that her identity is something to be proud of,” Whiley says. Whaipooti was named after her grandmother’s anglicised name Julia. “It was an intentional decision to give me the English name by my parents at the time because New Zealand has been pretty bad at pronouncing our names, and suppressing Māori culture and identity.” “We knew we will bring a Māori baby into the world and … our dream, as I think it is for many people, is you want your kids to live freely as themselves and confidently.” In 2011, 1.5% of names registered were Māori. While overall, the percentage of Māori names is still small – 2.6% of all names in the country registered in 2020 – the actual figures are believed to be higher. To be included in the data, at least one parent must be Māori and the name must fit the Māori Language Commission orthography. There must be at least 10 children given the same name within a year for it to be logged. Many Māori names will not be captured, including Ruataupare’s, either because there are under 10 registrations of the one name, or the name is not yet listed as an approved Māori name. Nikau and Mia remain the most popular Māori boys’ and girls’ names in 2020, having topped the list for the past several years. Whaipooti said this increase could be linked to previous generations fighting to reclaim the language. “There’s been a real platform that’s been laid, that says we should never apologise for being Māori in the land that we come from. I think many of us feel more comfortable with giving our next generation the comfort of being us.” When European missionaries and settlers arrived in Aotearoa New Zealand, they brought with them their own patronymic naming traditions, which were super-imposed on to the indigenous Māori population. Along with the changes in name format, came the anglicisation of Māori names, and then, as settlers became the dominant power of economy, bureaucracy and culture, bearing a Māori name could lead to racism and discrimination, particularly when it came to seeking jobs and housing. Whaipooti and Whiley said giving Ruataupare her name “would possibly come with a bit of work”. “We know she’s going to experience racism in her life, and we know that there are going to be people that butcher her name. We can’t stop that from happening. But what we are doing, and I think any parent would do, is to give your kids all the love that you can so that they know that they are loved and know where they belong.” After discovering a paucity in information on Māori naming practices and colonisation’s impact, historian Dr Joeliee Seed-Pihama set out to dedicate her PhD to this body of knowledge, with a focus on the Taranaki, where one of her tribes is from. Her thesis “stresses the need to intervene in the continued denial and denigration of our names”. “It quickly became unsafe for our tamariki [children] and whānau [family] to carry those names in the colonial world … These impacts of assimilation meant that the many whānau began to feel that Māori names were not beneficial to have within an imperialist society.” Seed-Pihama’s thesis is also a personal story, one which weaves in her own experiences and discusses giving her own children Māori names. “[It] was integral to the life we wanted for them as a symbol of their whakapapa, and of our aroha and pride in being Māori.” Māori names connect and create a sense of belonging for every individual, Seed-Pihama said, adding that decolonisation is key to Māori liberty and the resurgence of Māori names. “In other words, it requires a calling back of our names from the margins.” Damaris Coulter of Ngāti Kahu descent and Dale Dice of Ngāti Hine, Te Aupōuri and Ngā Puhi are honouring this decolonisation practice, by giving their one-year-old daughter Hinekōrako just one name, as was usual pre-colonisation. Hinekōrako’s name came to Dice as he was navigating a waka, a large traditional Māori sailing vessel, from Rarotonga in the Cook Islands back to Aotearoa. “It was coming up to midnight. We came into a little storm. The temperature had dropped … there was thunder … Once we got through the storm we all turned around and just behind us there was this massive white rainbow … It was a lunar rainbow.” “I told our navigator about it and he goes’ “oh yeah, that’s a tohu (sign), that’s Hinekōrako’.” In myth, Hinekōrako is also a taniwha (a water spirit), who lives between the spirit and living worlds. Dice wrote the name in his diary and decided that night, were he to ever have a daughter, she would be named Hinekōrako. But Coulter says when it came to deciding on a surname, the couple found it difficult to settle on a last name that would capture all of Hinekōrako’s whakapapa (genealogy). And so they decided against one altogether. Coulter said Māori have never stopped using those traditional practices or naming rights, and that it may be that only now is data capturing the number of names registered. But she says various societal movements led by Māori and the recent Black Lives Matter movement, have perhaps compelled people to introduce more indigenous reclamation practices into their lives. “To be committed to decolonisation, you have to start doing some things that may be a little bit inconvenient at first. [But] it makes sense to me to apply as many things as possible into our lives, and into Hinekōrako’s life, that would complement undoing some of the colonisation practices.”",News/World news,‘Fighting to reclaim our language’: Māori names enjoy surge in popularity,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/11/fighting-to-reclaim-our-language-maori-names-enjoy-surge-in-popularity
12/11/2021,"A triumph for the mutual movement? Well, a messy triumph at best. The £530m deal to sell LV= to private equity firm Bain Capital is dead, but 69% of votes were cast in favour. Such are the perils of requiring a 75% supermajority. Sometimes you end up with a muddle. But the outcome is definitely a defeat for an LV= board that failed to pitch its case coherently, ignored the swelling opposition to the takeover until too late and never truly grasped that a US private equity takeover of a mutual organisation would stir strong feelings. Rather than depart after trying to find “a way forward”, Alan Cook, the chairman, would do better to go immediately. His position looks untenable.  Cook & co’s first mistake was not to seek a formal mandate to sell LV=, or the Liverpool Victoria Friendly Society as it was known in less funky times. Members of mutuals are not like shareholders in a public company. Yes, those with savings in the core “with-profits” investment fund are there for the returns, but many also place an intangible value on being part of an organisation run for the benefit of its members. You can’t take that spirit of independence for granted. After unveiling the Bain deal a year ago, the board’s second error was not to explain its rationale in detail. The bald declaration that “business as usual does not work” was too lofty. Hadn’t LV= just sold its general insurance business, meaning car and home policies, to Allianz for £1.1bn? Wasn’t that sale supposed to shore up the capital position? And how, after 178 years in existence, could the basic demutualisation payout to members be as little as £100 a head? Since Cook and chief executive Mark Hartigan, who was paid £1.2m last year, were slated to continue under Bain’s ownership, it seemed a case of business as usual for them. As it happens, the duo, when they belatedly engaged with their members, had some decent counter-arguments. The basic £100-a-head wasn’t as miserly as it seemed because the 270,000 with-profit members, as opposed to the 1 million holders of life insurance policies, would get more. The standalone prospects were also genuinely uncertain. The life and pensions game is competitive and long term. If LV=’s spare capital from the Allianz disposal were to be directed at expansion, many of the elderly “with-profits” members might not live long enough to enjoy the gains. If those arguments had been made at the outset, 69% support might have become 75%. Now the strategic conundrum will be revisited. The most likely outcome is a deal with Royal London, the fellow mutual that has been muttering mischievously in the wings in recent weeks and says it has now tabled a proposal that is different from the one that LV’s board rejected a year ago in favour of Bain. A tie-up with Royal London does indeed look the most natural fit, especially if membership rights can be carried over. But the process of getting to this point has been shambolic.",News/Business,LV= sale to Bain might have gone through but for its board’s blunders,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/10/lv-sale-to-bain-might-have-gone-through-but-for-its-boards-blunders
12/11/2021,"Boris Johnson has repeatedly been accused of riding roughshod over independent advisers and of mishandling the machinery of state during his time in No 10. Equally, a series of aides who were once very firmly in the tent have ended up either walking or being booted out. Here are some examples of the behaviour the prime minister’s critics say makes him unfit for such high office.  Reports suggest Johnson’s independent adviser on ministerial interests is on the verge of quitting after the Electoral Commission report implied the prime minister misled him when he was investigating the funding of refurbishments to Johnson’s home. On Thursday, the prime minister denied lying to Christopher Geidt. Lord Geidt’s predecessor, Alex Allan, quit in November after the prime minister refused to sack the home secretary, Priti Patel, despite Allan’s formal investigation finding evidence she had bullied civil servants. The government’s LGBT advisory panel suffered a series of resignations over several issues before being officially disbanded. Three board members resigned in March over the delay in banning conversion practices. One, Jayne Ozanne, said the equalities ministers Liz Truss and Kemi Badenoch were ignorant. A second, James Morton, said they were not committed to LGBT equality. The third, Ellen Murray, urged the government to “drop the trans culture war”. The head of the government’s legal department resigned after a significant disagreement with the attorney general for England and Wales over plans to override parts of the Brexit deal on Northern Ireland. Jonathan Jones had repeatedly disagreed with Suella Braverman over points of law, but the final straw came over her interpretation of the EU agreement. Much ministerial energy and political capital was expended reopening and revamping the selection process to give Paul Dacre – the former Daily Mail editor and Johnson’s choice to run the regulator – a better chance after he messed up his first interview. Embarrassingly for the government, Dacre then decided he did not want the gig after all and pulled out. Critics have said the government’s elections bill, introduced in September, would limit the Electoral Commission, including by stopping it launching prosecutions. Since the bill’s introduction, the importance of the commission’s work was underlined when it concluded the Conservative party had not properly reported the donation of £52,801 made to fund the refurbishment of the prime minister’s private residence. Kathryn Stone was in Downing Street’s sights last month as the prime minister made an abortive attempt to save an ally her investigation concluded had committed an “egregious” breach of lobbying rules. Several ministers suggested Stone should quit, but then the government U-turned as it became clear its approach had proved desperately unpopular. That led to accusations the UK government had been used as a tool to undermine standards in public life in order to save the skin of a longstanding friend of Johnson. The judiciary is one of the most fundamental elements of oversight in politics and critics say ministers are trying to cripple this by limiting the use of judicial review, where a judge examines the lawfulness of an action or a decision of a public body. While ministers say the right has been abused, some MPs and peers have warned the plans would greatly limit accountability. Johnson was thought to be heavily reliant on the close allies, who had helped run the Vote Leave campaign. But they were turfed out of No 10 last November after a power struggle that also sucked in the prime minister’s wife, Carrie Johnson. There were suggestions they had lost Johnson’s favour over their treatment of his wife. Stratton was hired as Johnson’s spokesperson and originally intended to become the face of Downing Street during regular televised press conferences, for which a TV briefing room was installed at great cost. But her position within No 10 was severely undermined when that plan was dropped. She fell further out of favour and resigned after the video emerged of her laughing at a question about Downing Street aides flouting Covid rules during a mock press conference. One of Johnson’s most trusted aides, who followed him from London’s City Hall to Downing Street. He served as chief of staff in both roles – albeit on an interim basis in the latter – as well as being ennobled by his boss. But Lord Udny-Lister left in April and later apologised for his involvement in approving a £187m taxpayer-underwritten loan to a property company for which he was a paid adviser. Walden had also been a trusted aide earlier in Johnson’s career – standing by him while he was mayor of London, through his Vote Leave days and then stepping in to help his former boss when he became prime minister. But, once Cummings consolidated his own power, Walden was out. Similarly sidelined was the Australian election specialist, who had delivered Johnson electoral successes in London. Along with Walden, Crosby formed part of the City Hall group who found themselves increasingly squeezed as the Vote Leave faction’s grip on Downing Street tightened. Johnson’s adviser on civil society and communities resigned after a row in April over a report on racial disparities that concluded the UK did not have a systemic problem with racism. Kasumu was the prime minister’s most senior black adviser. He had previously said he was considering resigning over the conduct of Badenoch, suggesting she may have broken the ministerial code when she publicly criticised a black journalist on social media, and that tensions over race policies within No 10 had become unbearable.",News/Politics,Scandals and sackings: why critics say Boris Johnson is not fit to be PM,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/10/scandals-and-sackings-why-critics-say-boris-johnson-is-not-fit-to-be-pm
12/11/2021,"La Liga has won the latest battle after 37 of the league’s 42 clubs approved a €2bn partnership with the private equity fund CVC Capital Partners, but the war at the heart of Spanish football has deepened with Real Madrid, Barcelona and Athletic Club set to take legal action in an attempt to overturn the decision. The deal with CVC was ratified at La Liga’s general assembly on Friday after a week of tension and accusations involving the three clubs, two of whom cling to the breakaway super league project, and the Spanish league’s president, Javier Tebas.  According to the terms of the deal, announced in August, CVC will invest €1.994bn in Spanish football in return for an 8.2% share in a company that will be set up to manage the league’s television rights for the next 50 years – although CVC has admitted it is likely to sell within a decade. The deal was due to be worth €2.7bn but those clubs who did not want to participate were given the chance to opt out. Madrid, Barcelona and Athletic expressed opposition in the summer, with Barcelona’s president, Joan Laporta, turning his back despite having been presented with it as a solution to be able to re-sign Lionel Messi. Clubs will be able to access the first €400m instalment in the next few weeks, with 70% allowed to be spent on infrastructure, 15% on servicing debt and 15% on player signings. A two-thirds majority was needed to see it through. There was one abstention and four clubs voted against, the second division debutants Ibiza being the fourth. jMadrid, Barcelona and Athletic had been supported in their opposition by the Spanish Football Federation, which has been in a longstanding confrontation with La Liga. Those clubs had appealed for the government’s sports council to intervene and vowed to take all legal action necessary to prevent the deal. Madrid, Barcelona and Athletic had accused the CVC deal of being “ruinous” for Spanish football, saying it amounted to “mortgaging” the clubs’ future. The three dismissed the claim that CVC would be an active partner in the new company helping La Liga to develop strategies, insisting that the fund was solely “investors”. This week the trio presented an alternative source of funding for the league’s clubs, claiming that the terms were 15 times more economical. That sparked a back and forth of increasingly incendiary open letters. Tebas dismissed the offer to act on “behalf” of all clubs as cynicism, coming so close as it had to the vote. He said the proposal was unviable and noted that the investors behind it were the same financial institutions that had been super league backers. He sarcastically referred to Madrid’s president Florentino Pérez and his super league partners as the “saviours” of football. “The only intention is to derail a project that puts their own individual goals at risk, even if it means destroying the collective and competitive future of the clubs,” he wrote in an open letter. In a tweet, alongside a Pinocchio emoji, Tebas said: “Now Florentino Pérez remembers the same clubs (those who play ‘uninteresting’ games) he ignored when he prepared the super league.” Madrid and their partners responded with an open letter in which they called for a “structural reform of Spanish football” and vowed to fight the CVC deal legally.",Sport/Football,Real Madrid and Barcelona plan legal action against La Liga’s €2bn CVC deal,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/10/real-madrid-and-barcelona-plan-legal-action-against-la-liga-2bn-cvc-deal
12/11/2021,"Let’s not forget the impact Matthew Vaughn’s original Kick-Ass movie made in 2010. Based on the comic book of the same name by Mark Millar and John Romita Jr, this was Watchmen’s punky little kid brother, a spiky, primary-coloured black comedy about real-life superheroes for the social media age. Its undoubted star was 12-year-old Chloë Grace Moretz as foul-mouthed, deadly preteen Hit Girl, a role you knew she’d absolutely nailed when the Daily Mail called her “one of the most disturbing icons and damaging role-models in the history of cinema”. Aaron Taylor-Johnson seemed perfectly cast (if a little overly buff) as the nerdy title character, who finds himself biting off way more than he can chew when he decides to become a real-life costumed vigilante on the streets of suburban Staten Island. Kick-Ass proved an outlandish success because its creative team, Vaughn and screenwriter Jane Goldman, had the freedom to adapt Millar’s graphic novel with the biggest of geeky, fanboy-friendly hearts. The entire movie was made for just $30m outside the studio system after Vaughn bought the rights and raised the budget independently. The result was a surprisingly raw and bloody paean to comic book culture that inspired one of Nicolas Cage’s finest performances of recent years as the Adam West-channelling Big Daddy, Hit Girl’s father and crime fighting mentor.  At the time it would have been little surprise to see Kick-Ass go on to rival the then-burgeoning Marvel films for future box office glory. Unfortunately, the 2010 film was followed by a weak, studio-produced sequel from the previously unheralded director Jeff Wadlow. A listless, drab effort, it introduced Jim Carrey’s Colonel Stars and Stripes as the successor to Big Daddy, the casting director perhaps assuming that only the Canadian comic could match Cage’s furniture-chewing superpowers. Not a bad shout, you might think, except Carrey only gets 10 minutes of screen time, and subsequently refused to do the attendant publicity tour after denouncing his own movie’s “level of violence” in the wake of the Sandy Hook shootings. The sequel bombed at the box office after failing to inspire critics or audiences. So why are we even discussing Kick-Ass again, more than a decade on? Apparently Moretz, now 24 and having spent the previous decade cultivating a reputation as something of a minor scream queen, is open to a return. Teed up by Jimmy Fallon this week on The Tonight Show, she said: “I think it would be really fun to see where Hit Girl goes and what she is like as an adult. But I think it would have to be kind of perfect.” Moretz went on to suggest that this would require the return of Taylor-Johnson and Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who played villain Red Mist (later the Motherfucker), which seems reasonable. But I can’t help feeling she’s missing a trick here, because if Kick-Ass 3 ends up being another shallow, studio-produced retread, getting the old gang together (especially if that gang means the people who made Kick-Ass 2) really isn’t the answer here. Somehow, Universal (which now owns the franchise) needs to find a way of restoring the outlandish, anarchic insouciance of the original movie. Otherwise, Hit Girl is just another female superhero with attitude, while Kick-Ass is a rubbish Spider-Man knock off who never quite worked out how to get his webshooters going. That probably means getting Goldman to write the script and Vaughn to return to the director’s chair. At the very least the studio needs to find replacements with the renegade spirit to return this saga to its dissident roots. Without that basic investment in quality, the studio could bring Cage’s Big Daddy back from the dead and team him up with Christian Bale for a husky, deep-throated, Batman-themed shout off – and the result still probably wouldn’t be worth the price of entry.",Arts/Film,Could Chloë Grace Moretz’s Hit Girl survive another duff Kick-Ass sequel?,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/10/chloe-grace-moretz-hit-girl-survive-another-duff-kick-ass-sequel
12/11/2021,"Journalists Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov were awarded the Nobel peace prize on Friday, at a ceremony that Ressa was almost blocked from attending because of travel restrictions related to legal cases filed against her in the Philippines. Maria Ressa, 58, the chief executive and co founder of Rappler, praised for exposing abuse of power and growing authoritarianism under Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte, is facing charges that could lead to about 100 years in jail. She was granted permission to attend the ceremony earlier this month by the Philippine court of appeals, which ruled she was not a flight risk.  Dmitry Muratov, 59, editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta, who shared the 2021 Nobel peace prize, was described as one of the most prominent defenders of freedom of speech in Russia today. “Novaya Gazeta is the most independent newspaper in Russia today, with a fundamentally critical attitude towards power,” Berit Reiss-Andersen, chair of the Norwegian Nobel committee, said at the ceremony at Oslo City Hall. Berit Reiss-Andersen said that Ressa and Muratov were “participants in a war where the written word is their weapon, where truth is their goal and every exposure of misuse of power is a victory.” Both laureates had been “the object of ridicule, harassment, threats and violence as a result of their work,” she added.Ressa, referencing the restrictions imposed on her travel, said that she had at least been permitted to attend the ceremony. This had not been the case, she added, for the last working journalist to be awarded the prize in 1935 – Carl von Ossietzky, who was detained in a Nazi concentration camp. “By giving this to journalists today, the Nobel committee is signalling a similar historical moment, another existential point for democracy,” she said, pointing to the disruptive impact of social media in fuelling the spread of misinformation, and creating fertile ground for divisive, authoritarian leaders. “Without facts, you can’t have truth. Without truth, you can’t have trust. Without trust, we have no shared reality, no democracy, and it becomes impossible to deal with our world’s existential problems: climate, coronavirus, the battle for truth,” Ressa said during her lecture to the ceremony. “Our greatest need today is to transform that hate and violence, the toxic sludge that’s coursing through our information ecosystem, prioritised by American internet companies that make more money by spreading that hate and triggering the worst in us.” Rappler was praised for documenting how social media is used to spread fake news, harass opponents and manipulate public discourse. Ressa called in her lecture for legislation to hold social media companies to account, and for greater overseas development assistance funds to be given to media in the global south. She also said independent media should be helped to survive, by “giving greater protection to journalists and standing up against states which target journalists.” The Nobel laureates both paid tribute to journalists who have been murdered, jailed or forced into exile for their work. “I want journalists to die old,” Muratov said. Six journalists working for Novaya Gazeta have been killed – Igor Domnikov, Yuri Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Anastasia Baburova, Stanislav Markelov and Natalya Estemirova. In the Philippines, a total of 89 journalists have been killed since 1992, she said. This includes journalist Jesus “Jess” Malabanan, 58, who was killed in a drive-by shooting on Wednesday. Journalism in Russia was going through “a dark valley”, Muratov said. “Over a hundred journalists, media outlets, human rights defenders and NGOs have recently been branded as ‘foreign agents’. In Russia, this means ‘enemies of the people.’ “Many of our colleagues have lost their jobs. Some have to leave the country. Some are deprived of the opportunity to live a normal life for an unknown period of time. Maybe for ever. That has happened in our history before,” he said. Muratov condemned the militaristic propaganda promoted by state-owned media, and made a grim warning of the possibility of war between Russia and Ukraine. “In heads of some crazy geopoliticians, a war between Russia and Ukraine is not something impossible any longer. But I know that wars end with identifying soldiers and exchanging prisoners,” he said. Moscow has provoked alarm by amassing troops and weapons near Ukraine’s border. Describing journalists as an antidote against tyranny, Muratov added: “Yes, we growl and bite. Yes, we have sharp teeth and strong grip. But we are the prerequisite for progress.”",News/World news,Journalists Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov receive Nobel peace prize in Oslo,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/10/journalists-maria-ressa-and-dmitry-muratov-receive-nobel-peace-prize
12/11/2021,"Rupert Murdoch’s News Group Newspapers this week agreed a substantial settlement with the actor Sienna Miller, ensuring that her claims of phone hacking at the Sun did not go to trial. Why does the publisher of the Sun keep paying substantial sums of money to settle cases alleging illegality at the Sun?It is now 15 years since Murdoch’s News Group Newspapers was first having to address the use of illegal voicemail interception by its journalists.  Initially, the company falsely claimed that phone hacking was the work of one rogue reporter at the now-defunct News of the World. Since then, the company has paid hundreds of millions of pounds to settle hundreds of cases relating to the scandal. New claims are still being filed by individuals who claim their personal information was illegally targeted. What is the legal position of the Sun?It is accepted that phone hacking was widespread at the News of the World during the 2000s, but Murdoch’s company has always insisted that the Sun, edited by Rebekah Brooks during much of this period, was not involved in illegality. Brooks was personally found not guilty of phone hacking in a criminal trial in 2014. Haven’t people claimed in court that phone hacking took place at the Sun?Yes, allegations that phone hacking was rife at the Sun have been aired in pre-trial hearings, while individuals have received large financial settlements after alleging illegal behaviour at the daily newspaper. However, no judge has ever ruled on the veracity of these claims and they are strongly denied by Murdoch’s company. How can claims of wrongdoing at the Sun be settled without accepting wrongdoing?Murdoch’s News Group Newspapers owns two outlets: the still-publishing Sun and the now-defunct News of the World. When an individual makes allegations of phone hacking at the Sun, the legal claim is made against this parent company rather than a specific outlet. Any financial settlements with phone-hacking victims are usually accompanied by a statement, agreed by both sides, stating there is no acceptance that wrongdoing took place at the Sun. Why haven’t any of these cases come to trial?The main reason is money. Murdoch’s company has shown an incredible willingness to pay enormous sums of cash to settle cases that claim illegal activity took place at the Sun. This also avoids public trials where potentially uncomfortable allegations about executives such as Brooks, now the head of News UK, could be aired in court – and reported by the media. News UK this week unsuccessfully attempted to block the media from covering part of a hearing, forcing the Guardian and the BBC to hire a lawyer to ensure proceedings could be reported. But why do the phone hacking victims accept these financial settlements?Once again, the main reason is money. Speaking outside court, Sienna Miller made clear she was unhappy with this state of affairs: “I wanted to go to trial. I wanted to expose the criminality that runs through the heart of this corporation.” Despite being a successful actor, Miller said she could not afford the “countless millions of pounds to spend on the pursuit of justice” to have her day in court. She is suggesting that Murdoch’s company – as it has done in hundreds of other cases – offered her more money than she could have expected to win at a trial. As a result, even if Miller had insisted on a trial and then emerged victorious, the court system would be likely to punish her financially, because she could have settled at an earlier stage for more cash. She would then face picking up much of the multimillion-pound legal bill for both sides, in effect as a charge for wasting the time and money of both the court and News Group Newspapers. Who would be able to force a trial on claims of wrongdoing at the Sun?Someone willing to risk losing millions of pounds on a legal case in the hope of proving a point. Prince Harry has a phone-hacking claim relating to the Sun working its way through the courts. If there was no illegal behaviour at the Sun, why does Murdoch’s News Group Newspapers continue to pay substantial financial settlements to people claiming there was illegal behaviour at the Sun, rather than fight the accusations at a trial?The answer to this question remains unclear.",News/Media,The Sun says it didn’t hack phones – so why does its publisher keep paying out?,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/dec/10/the-sun-says-it-didnt-hack-phones-so-why-does-its-publisher-keep-paying-out
12/11/2021,"The Guyanese poet Grace Nichols will be awarded the Queen’s gold medal for poetry for her body of work, in particular her first collection of poetry I Is a Long-Memoried Woman, her prose, and several books for younger readers. Buckingham Palace announced on Friday that the Queen has approved the choice recommended by the Poetry Medal Committee, chaired by the poet laureate, Simon Armitage.  “Over the past four decades, Grace has been an original, pioneering voice in the British poetry scene,” said Armitage. “Her poems are alive with characters from the folklore and fables of her Caribbean homeland, and echo with the rhymes and rhythms of her family and ancestors … They are also passionate and sensuous at times, being daring in their choice of subject and openhearted in their outlook.” “Above all, Grace Nichols has been a beacon for black women poets in this country, staying true to her linguistic coordinates and poetic sensibilities, and offering a means of expression that has offered inspiration and encouragement to many.” Nichols, who moved to Britain aged 27, will become the 52nd recipient of the award, and the second in her own household – her husband John Agard won it in 2012. She is due to be presented with the medal in 2022. Nichols’ poetry, much of which is influenced by her Caribbean heritage, is on several GCSE syllabuses. I Is a Long-Memoried Woman won the Commonwealth poetry prize in 1983. “I was overwhelmed when I first got the news. It was both wonderful and humbling to be recognised in this way,” said Nichols. “As a poet you write your poems in solitude, never knowing whom they’ll reach. I feel so honoured and delighted to be given this award by her majesty and the committee.” She added: “In my own work I’ve celebrated my Guyanese/Caribbean/South American heritage in relation to the English traditions we inherited as a former British colony. To poetry and the English language that I love, I’ve brought the registers of my own Caribbean tongue. I wish my parents who use to chide me for straining my eyes, as a small girl reading by torchlight in bed, were around to share in this journey that poetry has blessed me with.” The Gold medal for poetry was founded in 1933 by King George V. Previous recipients include Philip Larkin, Siegfried Sassoon and WH Auden, as well as last year’s winner David Constantine, who was presented with the award by the Queen via videolink.",Arts/Books, Grace Nichols’ ‘pioneering voice’ wins her Queen’s gold medal for poetry,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/10/grace-nichols-pioneering-voice-wins-her-queens-gold-medal-for-poetry
12/11/2021,"Joe Joyce and Michael Conlan’s hopes of a 2016 Olympic medal upgrade have receded after the man tasked with investigating corruption in boxing said that proving which fights were fixed in Rio remained “elusive”. In the second of three reports into Aiba, amateur boxing’s governing body, Professor Richard McLaren said he had no doubts that there had been “significant” and “rampant” bout manipulation in Rio, with referees and judges discussing results beforehand. However, the subjective nature of boxing’s scoring system and “the fact that the predetermined result was often the correct result”, meant it was hard to prove the specific fights involved beyond reasonable doubt.  In October McLaren had indicated that Joyce’s super-heavyweight final defeat against France’s Tony Yoka, and Conlan’s loss in his bantamweight quarter-final against the Russian Vladimir Nikitin, were among 11 bouts being investigated. That led both Joyce and Conlan to tentatively hope they could get upgraded to a gold and bronze medal respectively. But on Friday, McLaren said that despite reviewing 77 bouts, his team had been unable to figure out a methodology “that would allow us to be confident to meet the legal standard in order to discipline a person who would have been engaged in bout manipulation”. “The officiating in boxing is highly subjective as there are no real benchmarks by which to evaluate the bouts,” he added. “So while we tried a number of different methodologies so we could declare a bout was manipulated, we concluded that it’s not possible to do that to the level to bring disciplinary action in the sport.” McLaren was able to find more evidence of corruption in other areas of the sport as recently as the World Junior Boxing Championships in Poland in April. McLaren also cited the behaviour of the deputy supervisor at the World Junior Boxing Championships in St Petersburg in 2016, who he said had pressured referees and judges to score in favour of certain countries. “A number of witnesses expressed fear about speaking out against corruption,” said McLaren. “One said he would be dead.” McLaren also revealed that the former executive director Karim Bouzidi, who had led the scheme to manipulate judges in Rio, had continued to have influence in the sport even after leaving Aiba.",Sport/Sport,Investigation unable to prove which Rio Olympic boxing bouts were fixed,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/10/investigation-unable-to-prove-which-rio-olympic-boxing-bouts-were-fixed
