Emily I had visions of meeting someone who thought Boris Johnson was doing a wonderful job, so I was relieved when we bonded straight away over our mutual dislike of him. Grace I had a veggie nut roast. And a knickerbocker glory. Emily I had the beef roast. And we both had a few drinks. Grace Scottish independence kept coming up. We agree that climate change is a big issue, but her solution to this – her solution to a lot of things – is to be independent from Westminster. She expressed herself well, but I don’t think it’s enough. She thinks Scottish independence will be a fresh start where we can create a better world. I’m a bit of a grumpy cynic: I think we should be trying to fix the system we’ve got. Emily One of the things I loved about chatting to her was that it wasn’t a conversation where each person had a portfolio of figures to cite. The amount of oil left in the North Sea varies according to what argument it’s being used for. She’s worried about the climate crisis, whereas I think there’s also significant fuel poverty in this country, which we could address better. Grace I’m of the opinion that the SNP is a populist party that will swing towards whatever will win it votes, and its policies are often more rightwing than people think. But she had some good points about its more socialist side, which I tend to ignore. Emily Our other big contention was Brexit: where the threshold should be. She thinks a referendum would have been less divisive if you made it at least 60:40 to pass. Which I don’t think is a good idea – it should be 50%. I sometimes wonder whether remain is trying to change the goalposts to head off Scottish independence. Grace We did have a conversation about Brexit, but it felt more like another conversation about independence. Emily We both liked Corbyn. She wasn’t sure where I was on the Palestine issue: I think she was holding her breath. But I support the Palestinians and their cause – we were on the same page with that. I’ve been on a lot of marches in Glasgow. Grace We agreed on so much about Labour and the Conservatives. Where we disagreed, it was just about priorities and solutions. She’s upset about the breaking of the rules within lockdown periods, and although I agree that it’s a bit upsetting, I find it more frustrating that they’ve given away billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money to their mates. Emily You can see the politicians lining their own pockets, their friends’ pockets, but for me it’s the people who keep voting for them. I just think: what are you doing? Grace We come from quite similar backgrounds: she’s English as well, grew up in Oxford, and I grew up in Cambridge. We moved to Scotland for university, loved it here and stayed. Emily I said I could never live in England again. I haven’t even been back for four or five years. Grace She has less faith in English voters than I do: she thinks England is doomed to a Conservative government indefinitely. Maybe I’m the optimist. Emily It’s mind-blowing what this government is getting away with. We both got angrier about them as the conversation went on. Grace She was a very lovely person – I had a good time.

4/14/2022,"Moscow has said it will be forced to strengthen its defences in the Baltic if Finland and Sweden join Nato, as the war in Ukraine entered its seventh week. The former president Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chair of Russia’s security council, said on Thursday that Russia would bolster all its forces – including deploying nuclear weapons – in the region if the two Nordic countries joined the US-led alliance. Finland and Sweden are both deliberating whether to abandon decades of military non-alignment and join Nato, with the two Nordic countries’ leaders saying Russia’s onslaught on Ukraine had changed Europe’s “whole security landscape”. Their accession to the alliance would more than double Russia’s land border with Nato members, Medvedev said. “Naturally, we will have to reinforce these borders” by bolstering ground, air and naval defences in the region, he said. Medvedev, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, also explicitly raised the nuclear threat, saying Finnish and Swedish Nato membership would mean there could be “no more talk of any nuclear-free status for the Baltic: the balance must be restored”. Russia had “not taken such measures, and was not going to”, he said. “But if our hand is forced, well … take note it wasn’t us who proposed this.” Russia borders the Baltic states of Estonia and Latvia, and the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad is sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania. Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, said on Wednesday that Finland, which shares a 1,300km (810-mile) border with Russia, was likely to decide on a Nato application “within weeks”, while her Swedish counterpart, Magdalena Andersson, said there was “no point delaying” the decision. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Russian forces, which have pulled back from northern Ukraine after failing to take the capital, were “increasing their activities on the southern and eastern fronts, attempting to avenge their defeats”. The deputy defence minister Hanna Malyar said on Thursday that Russia was massing troops along the Russia-Ukraine border, in Belarus and in the breakaway Transdniestria region of Moldova, with the eastern cities of Kharkiv, Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia coming under missile attack. The US unveiled a new military aid package, including armoured personnel carriers and helicopters, saying it was seeking to provide Ukraine with weapons that would give them “more range and distance” in advance of the anticipated attack. Moscow said on Thursday that its Black Sea flagship, the Moskva, had been “seriously damaged” by an explosion that the defence ministry said was caused by ammunition detonating “as a result of a fire”. Ukraine said the cruiser had been hit by a missile. Although the defence ministry later said the fire had been put out, news of the loss overshadowed Russian claims of advances in the devastated southern port city of Mariupol, largely reduced to rubble by a brutal six-week bombardment that the local mayor has said killed more than 21,000 civilians. Russia claimed on Wednesday that more than 1,000 Ukrainian marines had surrendered in the city, adding later that the port was under its full control. But Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, said on Thursday the battle over the seaport was “still ongoing today”. Mariupol is a key target in Moscow’s push to secure a land corridor between the self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk in Donbas and Crimea, which Russia occupied and annexed in 2014, and its capture would allow the Kremlin’s military planners to redeploy vital resources farther east. The Ukrainian deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said nine humanitarian corridors had been agreed to evacuate civilians, including by private car, from Mariupol, Berdiansk, Tokmak and Enerhodar, on Thursday, with others in Luhansk due to open if Russian forces stopped shelling. The Russian retreat from around Kyiv has led to the discovery of large numbers of apparently massacred civilians, drawing international condemnation and calls for a war crimes investigation. The Hague-based international criminal court, which deals with rights abuses, told reporters the country had become a “crime scene”. The ICC’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, said on a visit to Bucha, where officials say more than 400 civilians died: “We’re here because we have reasonable grounds to believe that crimes within the jurisdiction of the court are being committed.” Moscow has rejected all reports of atrocities, which Putin has dismissed as “fakes”. Russia’s invasion has so far driven more than 10 million Ukrainians from their homes, more than 4.6 million of whom have fled abroad. Western sanctions have triggered Russia’s worst economic crisis since the fall of the Soviet Union, analysts say. More than 600 western companies have pulled out of country.",News/World news,Russia says it will ‘reinforce borders’ if Sweden and Finland join Nato,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/russia-says-it-will-reinforce-borders-if-sweden-and-finland-join-nato
4/14/2022,"The Queen will not attend the Easter Sunday service in Windsor after pulling out of several events in recent months because of mobility problems. Buckingham Palace said the Queen, who has experienced health problems recently, was not expected to attend the event on Sunday, although it is not known why.Last week Buckingham Palace announced that the monarch, 95, would also not be attending the Maundy Thursday service at St George’s Chapel in Windsor. For the first time she will be represented by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall at what is considered an important fixture in the royal calendar. During the event Prince Charles will follow the ancient tradition of distributing Maundy money to key members of the community, along with meetings with the dean of Windsor, the Rt Rev David Conner and the Rt Rev John Inge. The Queen is understood to be in good health, but has some mobility problems. Last month, she was escorted by her son, the Duke of York, into a memorial service for her late husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, in her first major official engagement in six months. She has been increasingly delegating public appearances to other senior royals. As well as the Maundy service, Prince Charles stood in for the Queen at the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey last month. Thursday is the fifth time the Queen has not attended the Maundy service during her 70-year reign. The lord high almoner, the Rt Rev Michael Gresford Jones, the bishop of St Albans, represented the Queen in 1954, and six years later the Queen Mother stood in for her daughter, who had given birth to Andrew two months earlier. In 1964 the birth of the Earl of Wessex in March meant the Queen’s role was fulfilled by her aunt, Princess Mary, and in 1970, the Queen Mother distributed the Maundy money on behalf of the Queen, who was on tour in New Zealand.",News/UK news,Queen expected to miss Easter Sunday service ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/14/queen-expected-to-miss-easter-sunday-service

4/14/2022,"Towards the end of Digga D’s third mixtape, there’s a brief track called Statement. It features nothing more than a beat, a mournful piano figure, a weeping violin and the 21-year-old rapper’s voice, relating a blend of aggressive street-level reportage, stuff about his dealings with the police – of which more later – and suggestions that what he really wants is true love. It ends with him comparing himself to the biggest stars in the UK rap firmament, then considering his own commercial prospects. “I’m as hard as Stormzy and Dave, what a statement to make, but I say what I say and I mean it,” he offers. “But you will not agree and say I’m too in these streets and the act that I got I should clean it.” Then he adds a final, valedictory “fuck you”. You can see why he might respond that way: Digga D isn’t, at this point, at the platinum-selling level of Stormzy and Dave, but he’s doing pretty well for himself. A string of gold and silver singles; a previous mixtape, Made In the Pyrex, that got to No 3 in the album chart; enough clout to get big-name American rappers as guests on Noughty By Nature (B-Lovee drops a thrillingly raw-throated verse on What You Reckon, while Moneybagg Yo takes time out from releasing US chart-topping albums to appear on G Lock). Moreover, he has achieved this under extraordinary circumstances. In 2018, Digga D and the other members of drill group 1011 were subject to an unprecedented criminal behaviour order that prevents him from inciting violence, mentioning certain areas of London or making references to real-life people or incidents in his lyrics. The BBC documentary Defending Digga D showed the effects: a rapper on the phone to his lawyer, running through tracks line by line, trying to work out if saying “jump out, try and put him in a coffin” is going to put him back in jail. That said, the attention of the Met doesn’t seem to have altered Digga D’s approach much: even Noughty By Nature’s poppiest moment and solitary love song, Hold It Down, is couched in terms involving showing undying devotion through perjury and waiting until prison sentences are completed. He’s audibly a fan of 50 Cent: What You Reckon borrows its samples from his 2005 hit Best Friend; Hold It Down is based around 21 Questions; Pump 101’s title, beat and chorus are all derived from G-Unit’s Stunt 101. And if 50 Cent’s career tells you anything, it’s that the kind of trouble that would seem career-limiting in other lines of work can often have the opposite effect. 50 Cent, after all, went from being blackballed by the music business for writing the kind of rhymes that could get a person and their associates shot, to selling 30m albums. From the start of Noughty By Nature, you’re up to your neck in cheffings, shanks and the boring up of opps, albeit with a variety of names and locations bleeped out. Whether that will do anything to stem crime in London is a moot point, but it certainly lends interest. If you’re so inclined, this is not just music but a puzzle to be solved – albeit fairly easily, as you don’t have to look too hard on the internet to find out who and where he’s talking about. There is also a wilful blurring of the line that separates reality from telling gritty stories. “Everything you hear me rapping about is all facts, nothing’s fabricated / This shit you hear me rapping about is all cap, everything’s exaggerated,” runs the album’s intro. The lyrical viewpoint of Alter Ego alternates between Digga D the rapper and Digga D the “trap boy”, still immersed in gang life. The violence could be wearying but his undeniably brilliant flow – nimble but punchy – invests it with drama. As you might expect given his love of 50 Cent, there’s occasionally a hint of early 00s hip-hop lushness about the album’s sound, not least on the concluding Maverick Sabre feature Let It Go, and Digga is clearly trying to expand beyond drill to encompass trap and even pop balladry. This is sometimes to the album’s detriment. Its most thrilling moments come when it sticks fast to drill’s minimal and now distinctively British blueprint, rather than looking back towards the US. Musically, the best thing here may be Stuck In the Mud, an object lesson in making a little go a long way: there’s almost nothing to its sound beyond a beat and a weird, thin brass sample that weaves unsteadily around the rhythm track to unsettling effect – drill with its tempo slowed but the penetrating bass and eerie atmosphere remaining. It doesn’t undermine his abundant artistry to suggest that unsettling people is at the root of Digga D’s success. An authentic whiff of danger, of parent-scaring notoriety, is a rare and potentially valuable commodity in 21st-century pop and rock music. This is a world of media training, relatably matey demeanours and pains being taken to say the right thing, where a desire not to cause offence – nor provoke even the faux-outrage that fuels some sections of social media – rules supreme. Under the circumstances, why would he follow the suggestion to clean up his act? Nothing about Noughty By Nature suggests he needs to, and nothing about it suggests his current success won’t grow.

4/14/2022,"If you want to satirise a power figure or a political movement, you automatically reach for Shakespeare. Theatrical history is littered with examples. In 1937, Orson Welles staged a modern-dress Julius Caesar that evoked the worlds of Nazi Germany and fascist Italy. In 1941, Bertolt Brecht used Richard III as a template for his anti-Hitlerian The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui. In 1966, Barbara Garson’s MacBird! daringly suggested that Lyndon Johnson was a modern Macbeth implicated in the death of JFK. So it is hardly surprising that writers and directors turn to the Bard in depicting Donald Trump. The current example is Mike Bartlett’s The 47th at the Old Vic, which uses King Lear, Julius Caesar and Richards II and III to try and nail the Trump phenomenon: although highly ingenious, it is hardly likely to cause controversy. The opposite was the case when, in 2017, the New York Public Theater’s annual summer Shakespeare in the Park production was a Julius Caesar in which the tyrant was a blond-quiffed figure with a Slovenian-accented wife: a conspirator even argued that the Romans loved him so much that they would forgive him “if Caesar had stabbed their mothers on Fifth Avenue”. Such was the uproar over the assassination of the Trump-like Caesar that two of the Public Theater’s sponsors pulled their support. That production features prominently in a book by Jeffrey R Wilson unequivocally entitled Shakespeare and Trump. I can understand the temptation to look to the man from Stratford to explain the disruptive politician from Queens. My problem is that Trump lacks the reflectiveness, the rhetoric, the political acumen and the psychological complexity of Shakespeare’s tragic heroes and emblematic kings. When Bartlett wrote King Charles III, it was possible to believe that our future monarch would suffer the crises of conscience of his Shakespearean forebears. In the case of The 47th it requires all the skill of the brilliant Bertie Carvel to persuade us that Trump is a dramatically compelling protagonist. The more Bartlett’s Trump mimics the irony of Mark Antony or the demonism of Richard III, the more conscious you become of the gap between the politician and the prototype. Bartlett’s Trump is at his best when, still speaking blank verse, he attacks Kamala Harris for the Democrats’ failure to listen to people’s needs. “You speak to them like kids,” he tells her. “And not just kids but poorer, less good-looking / Trashy kids that you and your celebrities / All constant lecture from your raised pile.” That hits home. But, while Bartlett’s play is amusing and reads well, it struck me that the real Shakespearean parallel with Trump lies not among the kings and emperors but in the figure of Parolles in All’s Well That Ends Well: a hollow braggart who adopts a tone of leering curiosity towards women (“Are you meditating on virginity?” he asks Helena) and who lies his way out of trouble. So how do you dramatise Trump? Four years ago, Tony Kushner announced he was writing a play about him: having classified Trump as borderline psychotic, Kushner went on to say that “he really is very boring”, and so far nothing has emerged. My own hunch is that you either have to tackle Trump on his own terms – as a man who treats politics as a form of performance art – or you have to analyse the source of his appeal rather than the man himself. In the first category, I would place a Harold Pinter sketch, The Pres and an Officer, which was premiered as part of Jamie Lloyd’s season of short Pinter plays in 2018. In the sketch we saw an orange-complexioned, extravagantly coiffured Jon Culshaw, in a fit of pique, ordering the nuking of London under the mistaken impression it was the capital of France. The other method, of examining why people actually voted from Trump, was pursued by a number of writers in a show called Top Trumps staged by Theatre 503 in 2017. One particular piece by Christopher Adams was simply a verbatim interview with the writer’s mother on why she felt Trump would make her and the nation safer: Mark Lawson in his review said the piece should be taught on creative writing courses as an example of how to explore views with which the writer disagrees. But if any one play explained Trump’s America it was Lynn Nottage’s Sweat, written in 2015 before his election and set in a Pennsylvania rustbelt town in 2000. Through diligent research and careful listening, Nottage explored what she called “the American de-industrial revolution” and the anger and despair that greeted increasing unemployment and a steel firm’s proposal that everyone take a 60% pay cut to save the plant. Trump was never mentioned, but Nottage’s play did more than all the spoofs and satires to explain his electoral success. Shakespeare himself, of course, had a phrase for this process: “By indirections find directions out.” The 47th is at the Old Vic, London, until 28 May",Arts/Stage,Sad!

4/14/2022,"You will not remember this awful remake, for good reason. While the original was a classic piece of British cinema famed for its ambiguous (and literal) cliffhanger ending, this was a charmless hunk of dreck that ends with – no joke – Seth Green buying a set of speakers designed to be so loud that they can blow a woman’s clothes off. In a career in which Wahlberg has sometimes appeared to actively seek out bad movies, this will forever be his worst. Tim Burton’s Planet of the Apes is destined to go down in infamy. During its arduous development, Tom Cruise and Arnold Schwarzenegger were both attached to play the lead. Eventually, though, it fell to Wahlberg, who accepted the role without reading a script. It shows. Worse still, he left Matt Damon’s role in Ocean’s 11 to make this nonsense. On the plus side, the decision to transform the incomprehensible Transformers series into a Wahlberg vehicle seems to have finally killed the franchise off for good. However, this film still had to be made to accomplish this, and people still paid to see it – an unfollowable mishmash of sludgy CGI and berserk Arthurian legend. The nicest thing you can say about this film is that Wahlberg’s character doesn’t seem to want to have sex with his own daughter in this one, as he did in the previous instalment. The big question about The Happening is whether or not Wahlberg knew it would turn out to be terrible. Did he read this script – about plants causing people to commit suicide with telepathy – and think, “Wow, this is great, I’m going to do my best acting here!” Or did he think, “This film stinks, better ham it all the way up”? If it’s the former, this is the worst film ever. If it’s the latter, it might be the best performance of his career. Nobody knows for sure, which is why it’s all the way down here. There are generally two types of Wahlberg film: the films in which he knows that he is funny, and the films in which he doesn’t understand that he is funny. Daddy’s Home (and its even worse sequel) is a rare oddity, in that Wahlberg spends the duration actively attempting to be funny and missing by acres. Not even having Will Ferrell as a foil can save him. Where did Jonathan Demme’s homage (a remake of Charade starring Anna Karina, Charles Aznavour and Agnès Varda) go wrong? Was it the moment when he decided to cast Wahlberg in the Cary Grant role? Well, yes, obviously. This is a terrible film and Wahlberg is terrible in it, yet as this list demonstrates it is also not his worst film by a mile. If you squint and think really hard, you can just about see what was trying to be accomplished here. Uncharted is a big-money action film that (action aside) lives and dies by the chemistry between Tom Holland and Wahlberg. Sadly for everyone, that chemistry is dead in the water. Ridley Scott’s cursed Getty movie will forever be known as the film in which mid-scandal Kevin Spacey was replaced by Christopher Plummer at lightning speed after the film was completed. Would a more traditional release have drawn more attention to Wahlberg’s anonymously capable turn as a security agent? No. I have seen this film twice and still forgot that he was in it. And he’s on the poster. A video game adaptation that also stars Ludacris and Nelly Furtado, Max Payne deserves to be remembered for one scene and one scene alone, in which Wahlberg eats a handful of performance-enhancing drugs and then sort of roars in slow motion until the sky catches fire. It’s an awful film only partially salvaged by this entertainingly witless slab of Nic Cage cosplay. That rarest of things, a semi-enjoyable Michael Bay project, Pain & Gain pitted Wahlberg against The Rock in a film designed to make neither of them look good. As a film, it has its moments. As a performance, this seems to be one of the few times when Wahlberg has decided to take the piss out of his persona at the same time as his director. Wahlberg doesn’t do a great deal in this Tina Fey/Steve Carell action comedy – he effectively just turns up for a few scenes with his top off – but it’s a good distillation of what the man is best at. He is passive and open and minimal, exuding a confidence that could quite easily be confused for dumbness. This is a role of almost zero depth, but Wahlberg knows and happily makes the most of it. Not counting the ill-judged Danny DeVito military comedy Renaissance Man, this was Wahlberg’s film debut. While he was always going to be blown to the peripheries by a young Leonardo DiCaprio, in both material and performance, he nevertheless helped to create a riveting role as The Path Leo Could Have Taken. There is a hint here of things to come. Less than the sum of its parts, James Gray’s We Own the Night was a relatively little-watched two-hander about warring siblings, played by Wahlberg and Joaquin Phoenix. It’s violent, but the violence doesn’t land right. It’s nominally sexy, but the sexiness is laboured. Luckily Phoenix and Wahlberg’s focused performances stop the film from straying into outright disaster. You have to feel a little sorry for Wahlberg here. The film was about his friend and set in his home town, and he spent years unsuccessfully asking all manner of directors to make it for him. He eventually convinced David O Russell, only for the film’s budget to be halved. And once the Sisyphean task of getting the thing made was completed, Wahlberg ended up being the least interesting thing about it. Next to the showboating of Christian Bale and Melissa Leo (both won Oscars) and Amy Adams, Wahlberg’s quiet, dedicated central performance was hard to spot at first. That is a shame because he is never less than compelling. Had Wahlberg been born 20 years earlier, he could have made a whole career out of films like The Other Guys. The movie walks the line between action and comedy uneasily – it’s aiming for Midnight Run and rarely hits the target – but Wahlberg nails the tone from the off. Macho and silly in equal measure, the entire film ends up hanging from his every move. Is it too late to get him to do this more often? The Guardian’s second best film of 2012 might not have aged impeccably in the last decade, but it does refine the art of Knowing What To Do With Mark Wahlberg to a precise science. As the adult friend of an inexplicably sentient teddy bear, Wahlberg is close to spectacular here, his big open face conveying a range of emotion that flits from joy to anguish to outright confusion. I Heart Huckabees is the sort of film that you only watch twice for one of two reasons: either you’re blown away by Wahlberg’s performance or you absolutely hate yourself. One of the most intensely annoying films ever created, slathering a half-written sixth-form philosophy essay in the kind of relentlessly smug self-awareness that stops you from sleeping at night, the only thing that comes remotely close to saving I Heart Huckabees is Wahlberg’s sweet idiot firefighter Tommy. There is glee in his eyes when he repeatedly smashes Jason Schwartzman in the face with a space hopper that is 20 times better than anything else that happens in this godforsaken film. Behind-the-scenes shenanigans might have overcome the power of Three Kings – George Clooney is more than willing to explain to anyone who will listen – which is a shame, because the film holds up incredibly well. Not only does it keep its (grown-up, satirical) point of view in an iron grip at all times, but it also lays a canvas for a wackadoo war caper. While he lacks the sophistication of Clooney or the innate authority of Ice Cube, Wahlberg holds the entire thing together. Unlikely as it sounds, he becomes the one thing you end up caring about in the whole giddy mess. Looking back, The Departed wasn’t quite the knockout that everyone claimed at the time. It’s too long, too on the nose, too happy to indulge some of Jack Nicholson’s worst excesses. But, dear God, does the film light up whenever Wahlberg shows up. He doesn’t show up terribly often – and, with the exception of his final appearance, nothing he does is of much consequence – but the texture he adds to the film as a whole is undeniable. His Sergeant Dignam is a ball of hilariously unjustified fury throughout, and his accent is as thick as tectonic plate. Incredible. After three years of bit parts and missteps, this is where Wahlberg landed fully formed on the A-list. Boogie Nights is one of those movies that has transcended cinema to become a cultural touchstone, and Wahlberg’s performance – simultaneously roiling and guileless – as porn star Dirk Diggler deserves just as much credit as Paul Thomas Anderson’s script or the setting, or the soundtrack. In retrospect, Boogie Nights was both a blessing and a curse for Wahlberg; it proved he could really act, but also set a high-water mark that he couldn’t hope to live up to.

4/14/2022,"Female fans not being allowed inside stadiums has long been the overriding international image when it comes to women and football in Iran and unsurprisingly so. Just over two weeks ago a number of Iranian women tried to get into the Imam Reza Stadium in the north-eastern city of Mashhad to watch the men play their final 2022 World Cup qualifier against Lebanon. They could not see the game – the ban has largely been in place since not long after the 1979 revolution – and then, according to some reports, they were treated to pepper spray by security guards. Despite requests from Fifa, criticism from around the world and calls from the players, authorities have yet to budge. Now, though, Iranian women are competing around the world and aiming to change minds in Tehran. In January, the national team played at the Women’s Asian Cup, their first international tournament. The opening game produced a creditable 0-0 draw with India in Mumbai. A Covid outbreak meant the hosts withdrew from the competition and their results were voided. For Iran, it meant that only their 7-0 and 5-0 losses at the hands of the eventual winners, China, and Taiwan respectively will go down in the record books. There was more to it than mere scorelines however. The coach, Maryam Irandoost, is confident the more the women play competitively around Asia, and one day the world, the greater the push will be to introduce equality in the stands back home, where the regime has made the occasional gesture in allowing women inside only to backtrack soon after. “I have tried for years to change this,” she says. “Our girls qualifying for and playing in the Asian Cup has changed the beliefs of a lot of people in Iran and I think this barrier will disappear in the near future. “Going into stadiums is not only about watching the matches and not only about increasing the number of fans. It will also change the vision of women’s football in Iran.” Irandoost, born at the height of the revolution, days after Ayatollah Khomeini returned from exile in Paris to take power, was delighted with the performances in India. “I am not disappointed with the tournament at all,” she says. “Our girls have good potential technically. We have areas in which we have to work on but if there is the same kind of investment and infrastructure as there has been over the past year then we will be at the same level with the best teams in Asia in five or six years.” Given Iran are ranked 70 in the world, behind Fiji and Haiti, to match Japan, the 2011 World Cup winners, Australia and China by the end of the decade would be quite an achievement for a team only just getting going. “There is a gap of 50 years behind the best teams in the world,” Irandoost says, “but families here are very interested in football and this encourages girls to play.” Irandoost, whose father, Nosrat, was a professional player and now coaches the second-tier men’s club Malavan FC, estimates there are about 2,500 female players in the top league and local clubs. “There has never been money in female football but the grassroots game is becoming more and more professional. We have a good infrastructure. The interest in the last three or four years has increased significantly. In the past nine months, the federation has had a good plan and that helps us qualify for the Asian Cup.” She says the reasons for the federation’s recent investment and support are complicated. Footballing wise it makes sense because Iran wants to host international tournaments. Recent investment from Saudi Arabia in women’s football – its national team recently played its first international fixtures –has been noted and there is a feeling Iran has the talent to compete on the world and not just the Asian stage. The men do just that and are preparing for a third successive World Cup and a group containing England and the United States in Qatar. “It is hard to say which team will advance but our men’s national team have always shown that they can face bigger teams and get good results.” Irandoost says. “If federation support continues then we can also play England and the USA at the World Cup in 10 years.” At the moment, Irandoost just wants to build on the progress from the Asian Cup. “That was very important. Before, many thought that it is OK for girls just to play football but after the Asian Cup people are saying that we could be in big tournaments and even win. Our goals have become much bigger in many ways.”",Sport/Football,‘Change the vision’: Iran Women push to break football barriers amid fan ban,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/14/change-the-vision-iran-women-push-to-break-football-barriers-despite-fan-ban

4/14/2022,"Good morning. The flagship of Russia’s Black Sea fleet has been severely damaged, Moscow has said, following an explosion that Ukraine claimed was due to a missile strike. The entire crew was evacuated. “As a result of a fire, ammunition detonated on the Moskva missile cruiser. The ship was seriously damaged,” the Russian defence ministry said, adding that the cause of the fire was being determined. A Ukrainian official said it was hit by two anti-ship missiles but did not provide evidence. The setback for Moscow comes as its offensive in Ukraine’s south and east intensifies, with Russia claiming its forces have taken full control of the besieged city of Mariupol. This has not been independently confirmed. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called for an oil embargo on Wednesday, demanding EU states “stop sponsoring Russia’s military machine”. The US president, Joe Biden, announced a further $800m in military assistance to Ukraine as the country prepares for Russia to ramp up its efforts in the country’s eastern regions. A Michigan police officer fatally shot a Black man in the back of the head while he was face-down on the ground, following a traffic stop, chase and struggle over a Taser gun, according to videos released by police. Patrick Lyoya, 26, was killed outside a house in Grand Rapids on 4 April. The city’s new police chief, Eric Winstrom, released four videos on Wednesday, including footage recorded by a passenger in Lyoya’s car. The footage shows Lyoya running from the white officer after being stopped over his vehicle’s license plate. They struggled in front of several homes, with a fight over the Taser lasting about 90 seconds, according to Winstrom. The officer repeatedly ordered Lyoya to “let go” of his Taser. In the final moments, the officer was on top of Lyoya, kneeling on his back at times. What will happen to the officer? He is on paid leave during the investigation. Where did the footage come from? Lyoya’s passenger, the officer’s body-worn camera, the patrol car and a doorbell camera. Donald Trump’s former chief of staff Mark Meadows has been removed from North Carolina’s voter roll amid an inquiry into whether he committed voter fraud by registering at a residence he never owned or lived in. The New Yorker, which reported the story last month, said Meadows, a former North Carolina congressman, had registered at a rented mobile home in Scaly Mountain, which he reportedly had never visited. Meadows, who has claimed voter fraud played a role in Trump’s election defeat, then voted from there as an absentee in the 2020 presidential election. Why was he removed? Meadows reportedly voted in Virginia, where he owns a property, in 2021, triggering his removal from North Carolina’s rolls. The North Carolina state bureau of investigation is continuing its inquiry into possible voter fraud, according to the Citizen, and would not say if Meadows’ removal from the roll would affect its investigation. The UK will send people seeking asylum 4,500 miles away to Rwanda for processing as part of an immigration crackdown. Migrants will reportedly have their asylum claims processed in Rwanda and be encouraged to settle there. A man has been charged with a federal terrorism offence over the gun attack on a New York subway train. Frank R James, 62, was arrested on Wednesday afternoon on Manhattan’s Lower East Side without incident and is being held by police. Cuba Gooding Jr has pleaded guilty to forcibly touching a woman at a New York nightclub in 2018. Accused of violating three different women in 2018 and 2019, Gooding has pleaded guilty to one of the allegations. Six thousand tonnes of trash piled up on Gibraltar as the territory dealt with post-Brexit paperwork – an unexpected consequence of the UK’s exit from the EU. After the transition period ended, so did the territory’s waste disposal arrangement: it had previously sent its trash to a facility in the Spanish province of Cádiz. The last of the refuse was cleared just before Gibraltar was hit by a storm this month. When five-year-old Carlo Amodeo first saw a swarm of black bees in 1960s Sicily, he dreamt about them every night for a week. Now 62, Amodeo has been a beekeeper for more than 40 years and has been key to the recovery of the Sicilian black bee after it approached extinction in the 1970s. “I dream of seeing bees flying around without the risk of being poisoned. This would give back a bit of what they give to us and a better life for future generations.” Consider the humble banana. The fruit symbolizes the threat posed by the world’s food diversity crisis: hundreds of different varieties have been cultivated over thousands of years. But we now eat just one variety, which is being threatened by a fungus, aided by conditions exacerbated by the climate crisis. More than the banana is at stake, though, as this interactive feature explains: “We’ve literally eaten ourselves into a tight genetic corner.” Unless diversity is embraced in food production, the climate emergency will trigger devastating crop losses.

4/14/2022,"All fast food will eventually become vegan, a leading plant-based restaurateur has said, after Burger King made one of its flagship restaurants meat-free. The Burger King outlet in Leicester Square, London, has been offering only vegan food for a month to test its popularity. This includes a plant-based version of its Whopper burger, as well as a “chicken” katsu burger and vegan nuggets. James Lewis, who works in marketing and product development for the vegan restaurant 123V on Bond Street, London, said this was part of a growing trend. Lewis, who with the French chef Alexis Gauthier runs two fully vegan restaurants in London, said: “What we were looking for was to appeal to everyone in a family, a group of friends, people who weren’t vegan to begin with. We call [the vegan burger] a gateway dish, something someone is easily familiar with.” He hoped that meat-eating friends of vegans would visit the restaurant, try its vegan burger and realise it was just as nice as a regular one – and perhaps make that swap more frequently in future. Because much of the meat in fast-food dishes is processed, in a sauce or under a layer of condiments and cheese, vegan options have been relatively easy to substitute. When Greggs launched a vegan sausage roll in 2019, many commented that the meaty, herby mush contained within the crisp pastry was almost indistinguishable from the real thing. The chain has since made a vegan version of its popular sausage, bean and cheese melt. “Fast food is 100% the best area to switch to vegan,” Lewis said, adding: “The chains are often sneered at by people but they are setting the trends here. There’s no point starting a vegan chain because once McDonald’s figure out how to make a good vegan burger, they will think: ‘What’s the point in the cost of keeping all these animals when we can make it just as good and grow it in the ground?’ “Not too long from now, people will be getting their burger and it’ll be a vegan one and that’ll be the norm and they won’t think any different.” Burger King has set a target of a 50% meat-free menu by 2030. However, the chain’s decision to turn its Leicester Square branch vegan has caused some controversy. Dominique Samuels, a commentator for the rightwing broadcaster GB News, accused the chain of being “manipulative”. She said: “It’s extremely manipulative. It’s right where all of the clubs are and hungry drunk people, for example, won’t have many options. Burger King has been there for as long as I can remember. So it’s basically trying to force people into consuming chemically enhanced fake meat.” Lewis said he did not agree with this assessment, adding: “I don’t think Burger King is trying to trick anyone … they’ve painted the whole thing green and put in 6ft-long letters ‘meat free’. “A lot of people are terrified of looking at themselves in the mirror and seeing the world being changed and having their morals questioned.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Meat feasts to go: Burger King tests all-vegan London branch,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/14/meat-feasts-to-go-burger-king-tests-all-vegan-london-branch
4/14/2022,"The number of people in England waiting to start routine hospital treatment has risen to the highest level since records began 15 years ago, with A&E and ambulance waits also soaring amid high Covid rates, staff shortages and increased demand. NHS data shows 6.2 million people are waiting to start treatment, the highest number since records began in August 2007. Of these, 23,281 have been waiting more than two years. NHS England said this was down from 23,778 at the end of January, but it is about nine times the 2,608 people who had been waiting this long in April 2021. Ministers have promised to eliminate all waits of more than two years by July. But doctors, NHS leaders and health experts say the target looks increasingly unachievable. On Wednesday the Guardian revealed that operations were being cancelled across England as Covid causes major disruption in the NHS. The NHS is under severe pressure caused by a combination of unprecedented demand for urgent and emergency care, tens of thousands of Covid-related staff absences, high numbers of people in hospital with Covid, and delays in discharging patients as Covid and workforce gaps hit social care services. Thursday’s figures show the extent of the crisis. The proportion of people waiting more than four hours at A&E departments rose to its highest ever level in March. Just over 28% of people waited at least four hours across all A&Es, while in type 1 A&Es – those at major hospitals – the rate was 41%. There were more than 2.1 million attendances at A&Es in March, up 28.5% on March 2021. A record 22,506 people waited more than 12 hours in A&E in March from a decision to admit to actually being admitted. That was up from 16,404 in February, and is the highest for any calendar month in records going back to August 2010. “Today’s data highlight the extreme pressure on NHS patients and staff, with millions of people feeling the negative effects of a health system struggling under unbearable strain,” said Hugh Alderwick, the director of policy at the Health Foundation. Danielle Jefferies, an analyst at the King’s Fund health thinktank, said that despite a recent focus from the government on tackling the backlog, the data showed “pressures now reaching unacceptable levels in all parts of the health and care system”. The average response time last month for ambulances in England dealing with the most urgent incidents – calls from people with life-threatening illnesses or injuries – was nine minutes and 35 seconds. This was up from eight minutes and 51 seconds in February and is the longest average since current records began in August 2017. Ambulances in England took an average of one hour, one minute and three seconds last month to respond to emergency calls, such as for burns, epilepsy and strokes. This was up from 42 minutes and seven seconds in February and is the longest time on record for this category of callouts. Dr Tim Cooksley, the president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said it was “deeply concerning” that the “inability to even come close to meeting performance targets has now come to be expected” every month. “There is not a chance of a recovery of elective care until the systemic problems beleaguering urgent and emergency care are sorted effectively and long term,” he said. Prof Stephen Powis, the NHS England national medical director, said: “Nobody should be under any illusion about how tough a job NHS staff have on their hands, balancing competing priorities and maintaining high-quality patient care.” Despite pressure on multiple fronts, the longest waits for patients were falling, he added, and staff were working hard to adopt innovative approaches to help patients get treated faster.",News/Society,Number of people on NHS waiting lists in England at record high,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/14/number-of-people-on-nhs-waiting-lists-in-england-at-record-high
4/14/2022,"Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the heartbreaking stories of families torn apart and desperate women and children fleeing violence and atrocities have reminded us all of the brutal reality faced by refugees escaping conflict and oppression all over the world. The British public have shown remarkable compassion and understanding in wanting to offer a warm welcome to all Ukrainians seeking sanctuary in the UK. But instead of harnessing this compassion for refugees and making Britain a nation of sanctuary – as the Scottish government has pledged to do – Boris Johnson’s administration in England has chosen to effectively offshore people seeking asylum to Rwanda; to treat them as no more than human cargo to be shipped thousands of miles away so they are out of sight and out of mind. They would no longer be given a fair hearing on UK soil – and would be penalised for having, through no fault of their own, taken the wrong route to safety. It takes the government’s desire to punish and expel our fellow human beings to another level. Under its cruel nationality and borders bill, which will next week return to the Commons after being defeated for a second time by the Lords, those coming across the Channel would be criminalised and could face imprisonment for up to four years. Rwanda already hosts around 140,000 refugees in six refugee camps. The country’s president, Paul Kagame, regularly speaks about his commitment to refugee protection, having himself been a refugee in Uganda. However, the country has a poor human rights record, is a source country for many refugees who fear political persecution and torture by the Kagame regime, and has been accused of engaging in assassination attempts against Rwandan exiles abroad. If you were a Ukrainian refugee or an Afghan fleeing the Taliban, you certainly wouldn’t want to be sent to Rwanda. Israel sent Eritrean and Sudanese asylum seekers to Rwanda under a policy that was eventually abandoned following international and domestic criticism and protests. A study by German academics found they weren’t given the opportunity to apply for asylum – and were forced to embark on dangerous journeys at the hands of people smugglers to get to safety elsewhere. When Australia sought to send people seeking asylum to neighbouring pacific island nations Papua New Guinea and Nauru, the policy was a failure. A review of the sorry episode by the University of NSW in Sydney concluded it didn’t deter people taking dangerous journeys or do anything to break the business model of people smugglers. Instead it incurred huge financial cost for taxpayers, triggered multiple legal challenges and led to “systemic cruelty” with people taking their own lives and self-harming. Over the past decade, Australian government data suggests that just more than 3,000 asylum seekers have been outsourced, at a total cost of over £1bn, and most were ultimately recognised as refugees. And let’s not forget that the people the government is seeking to offshore are not all illegal economic migrants, as it claims, but are mainly those who have escaped bloodshed and terror. They are exercising their right under the UN refugee convention, which the UK was a founding signatory of, to seek asylum in a country of their choosing. Government data shows that those coming across the Channel are mainly from 10 countries, including Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Eritrea and Afghanistan, where persecution and oppression are not uncommon. Overall, around two-thirds are actually granted refugee status or protection in the UK. There is little to suggest the government’s plans to send people seeking asylum to Rwanda will be a success for them individually, or for the government in terms of deterring people from making dangerous journeys at the hands of people smugglers. There are, of course, better ways to create a fair, humane and orderly asylum system. It is possible to demonstrate control while protecting the most vulnerable. Doing so has two main elements. First, protection in host countries around the world must be strengthened. In a globalised world, if the UK is serious about reducing the need for refugees to take dangerous journeys, it should invest in humanitarian and development aid for them in countries where people flee from. In east Africa, it should support countries such as Rwanda, Kenya, and Uganda to better protect the refugees that they already host. Instead of spending millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money on transferring refugees thousands of miles away, we could allocate that money to assist hundreds of thousands of refugees before they risk their lives by travelling to the UK. Based on Australia’s failed experience, offshoring one asylum seeker for one year is likely to cost the same as supporting thousands of refugees already in situ for a year. Second, and most importantly, the government should adopt effective policies that will actually address the Channel crossings. It should invest in fair and effective asylum processing when people arrive, on both the beaches in France and in the UK. At the end of last year, more than 100,000 people were waiting for an outcome on their initial claim for asylum – and of them 62,000 had been waiting for more than six months. We should also offer humanitarian visas from assessment centres set up at British embassies elsewhere in Europe, including France and other key “hotspots”, to enable people in need to travel without resorting to smuggling networks. And critically, we should work multilaterally – not with remote countries such as Rwanda, but through an effective bilateral agreement with France and our EU neighbours. There are many ways to achieve effective borders while protecting vulnerable refugees. They need not rely on criminalising men, women and children who reach our shores, or on paying large sums of taxpayers’ money to other countries to run schemes that are proven to be cruel and ineffective.
