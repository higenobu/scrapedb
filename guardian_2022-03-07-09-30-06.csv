3/7/2022,"Afavourite place, a word that makes your mouth happy, and a sentence. That’s all Improbable require of their audience, and with it, their improvised musical can begin. Tonight’s finds the team dramatising – in song, sketch and object animation – Charles Wicksteed’s bequest of a park to the town of Kettering. Was Wicksteed a philanthropist, or a capitalist laundering his guilty conscience? Will two lakeside lovers ever pop one another the question? And what do eucalyptuses have to do with it? Such is the stuff of tonight’s musical adventure, which just about weaves these extemporised strands into a coherent 80-minute whole. OK, so the time period is vague, the romantic subplot is barely tethered to the main narrative, and one or two story offers die of neglect. But the point of improv isn’t perfection. It’s teamwork, Zen-like acceptance of success and failure alike, and it’s the joy of inspired creation in action. At all of which, Improbable are past masters whose show (directed by Lee Simpson, with a band led by Christopher Ash) is a delight to watch. An imbalance in the team dynamic is suggested early at the performance I see, mind you, as the crowd redoubles its applause when Josie Lawrence takes centre-stage. And tonight, the senior improvisers (Lawrence, Niall Ashdown, Ruth Bratt) dominate proceedings. In her top-hatted Wicksteed persona, Bratt teams up with Lawrence on a terrific number playing on the multiple meanings of “giving it all away”, then with Ashdown on a blissful ballad of emotional inarticulacy that wouldn’t shame a Sondheim. At such moments, when what you’re watching is both heart-burstingly real and obviously a game at the same time, the company hit their glorious sweet spot. I enjoyed, too, how cheerfully they acknowledge misunderstandings, as when they find themselves busily assembling a water slide in mutually exclusive ways. The solution is one of several instances of adroit DIY staging, as various tarps and fabrics are configured to suggest lakes, bedclothes, shrouds and an errant dog. It comes from almost nothing and leaves scarcely more in its wake – but, while it lasts, An Improbable Musical is a lovely, open-hearted exercise in spontaneous creation.

3/7/2022,"Gracie Spinks was doing what she loved most – feeding her beloved horse one morning before work – when a stalker she had previously reported to the police killed her. Her death came just a few months after Sarah Everard was murdered by police officer Wayne Couzens in March 2021, triggering a nationwide conversation about violence towards women and confidence in policing. But a year on from Everard’s death, the parents of Spinks have delivered a stark warning that mistakes are still being made in the cases such as their daughter’s. “After everything that happened last year, the perception of the police with the general public is really low at the moment,” said her father, Richard Spinks. “They’ve got to realise people don’t trust them. They’ve got to do something, they’ve got to make some changes.” The 23-year-old’s family remember her as a young woman who lived a life full to the brim, spending most of her spare time tending to her horse, Paddy, and taking him to competitions. She played the piano, painted, worked as a swimming teacher and had a busy social life. There simply wasn’t time for a boyfriend. “She had her whole life mapped out. I say this all the time, but she did light up the room wherever she went. Everybody took to her,” Spinks added. “She was a very talented girl.” The family often reflect on the chain of events that led Gracie’s death, and how things could have turned out differently. As well as her many hobbies, she juggled multiple jobs in and around Old Whittington, in Chesterfield, while studying, said her mother, Alison Heaton. So it was no surprise that when Covid hit, Gracie struggled to sit at home on furlough and found a job at a local e-commerce company, Xbite. It was at Xbite that she met 35-year-old Michael Sellers, her supervisor, who asked her out for dinner. The pair met a handful of times, but Gracie soon decided she was too busy for a relationship and ended things. But Sellers had become infatuated with her. She told her parents that he would bombard colleagues with hundreds of messages asking questions about her. At one point he spent £15,000 on a white Scirocco, which Gracie had told him was her favourite type of car. But it was the morning she found him waiting for her before work at the field where she kept her horse that she decided to report him to her employer. “She said, ‘It’s really spooking my mum’, and I think she’d decided then enough was enough,” said Heaton. “But I think she was a bit nervous to complain about him because he was her supervisor.” After her complaint, Sellers was fired from his job. Gracie was advised to report him to the police, but chose not to pursue a restraining order and asked police to caution him instead. Gracie had no more contact with Sellers, and as far as she and her family were concerned, the problem was dealt with. “He was completely off the radar. We had drawn a line under it all and thought, ‘That’s it,’” said Heaton. A few months later, on the morning of 18 June 2021, Gracie left the house in a rush. “She said she’d not got time to drink her tea and actually took it with her in one of the mugs,” said Heaton, who remembers every detail of that morning. When she got a call to say Gracie had been found lying in the field, covered in blood, her first thought was that a horse had kicked her. An inquest revealed she died from a stab wound to the neck, and police believe Sellers – who was found dead in a nearby field – killed Gracie. “It’s probably the worst thing that can happen in your life. Nobody wants to see their children die, especially in that way,” said Spinks. It later emerged that around a month prior to the attack, a rucksack containing weapons – a hammer, axe and knives – as well as Viagra had been found across the road from the field and handed in to Derbyshire constabulary. An investigation after Gracie’s death revealed that documentation in the bag, which Sellers frequently carried to work, had details on it linking it to his family home. The force is now being investigated by the police watchdog over its handling of Gracie’s original complaint against Sellers, and the rucksack. A police sergeant and two constables were served with misconduct notices in November. “Them admitting that they failed, it doesn’t alter anything for us. I just want them to say it. Because it’s ruined our life, absolutely ruined our lives,” said Heaton. In the months since Gracie’s death, her parents and the local community have thrown themselves into a campaign to get more funding for stalking advocates, and have gathered more than 100,000 signatures on a petition, which prompted a debate in parliament. “When Gracie was killed, it was the last straw for me. I was appalled. I started the petition and the response was overwhelming,” said local campaigner Jackie Barnett-Wheatcroft, who has now set up a charity, Stalking Victims Support UK, to continue pushing for change in Gracie’s memory. “We’re doing this for the past victims and the future victims. It doesn’t feel like the police, or government, are learning from past mistakes, and we need to change that.” In a significant win for their campaign, last month Derbyshire constabulary said it was recruiting a stalking coordinator in response to rising cases, and to ensure investigations are properly carried out. “We’ve achieved something already, but we want it across the board, with all constabularies. A lot of police forces now have sat up and thought they need to do something about this.” said Spinks. “People say to us: ‘You’re doing really well, I don’t know how you can do all this.’ And I think, ‘Well, we’ve got to do it.’ How can we say we’re not going do anything about it? We’ve got to make a difference.” The couple take solace in the fact that Paddy is now being cared for by Gracie’s best friend, Ben, thanks to a fundraising drive after her death. “We’ll never get over what happened to Gracie, we’ll never accept it,” said Spinks. “But we feel that we’re on a mission to make some changes.” Derbyshire constabulary said: “We continue to support and fully cooperate with the IOPC investigation into the circumstances leading up to the tragic death of Gracie. “We are keeping the IOPC up to date with a number of improvements we have implemented in recent months and we would encourage all victims of stalking and harassment to report incidents to us for investigation.” Xbite said: “Gracie will always be a part of our work family. She is missed each and every day and we will keep her in our hearts and minds always.”",News/UK news,Parents of murdered Gracie Spinks deliver stark warning on police failings,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/07/parents-of-murdered-gracie-spinks-deliver-stark-warning-on-police-failings
3/7/2022,"More than 1 million girls who thought of themselves as sporty at primary school lose interest in physical activity as teenagers, according to estimates based on a new survey. The study, by Women in Sport, found that a fear of being judged and a lack of confidence were the main reasons cited for a waning interest in sport among teenage girls. Its poll of more than 4,000 teenagers found that 43% of girls felt they were sporty at primary pupils but no longer saw themselves this way. This would equate to 1.3 million girls across the UK, the survey pointed out. Out of these girls, 68% said that a fear of feeling judged prevented them from taking part, while 61% said they lacked confidence. Just under half (47%) said they were too busy with school work to carry on with sport. And teenage girls were much more likely to say they used to be sporty but were no longer keen on exercise than boys (24%). A report on the findings concluded that girls may need more support to engage with sport as they go through puberty. Nearly eight in 10 (78%) of girls who said they used to be sporty admitted they avoided taking part in sport when on their period – higher than those who had never been sporty (69%) and those who were still passionately involved in sport (64%). Overall, seven in 10 girls said they avoided sport when menstruating, citing pain, tiredness and self-consciousness. The poll also found that the pandemic had affected teenage girls’ worries about their appearance, as well as mental health issues, more than boys. It found they are less physically active than boys in general and are far less likely to take part in team sports. “Worryingly, girls lose their love of sport and exercise during teenage years, and this presents a significant psychological barrier throughout life,” the report says. According to the survey, among respondents aged between 11 and 16, just 37% of girls enjoyed physical activity compared with 54% of boys. By age 17 to 18, just three in 10 girls would describe themselves as sporty, compared with six in 10 boys. Self-belief and body image concerns were found to be issues that all girls struggled with, but this was especially true for girls who had stopped taking part in sport and physical activity as they grew older. Of previously “sporty” girls, 73% said their dislike of others watching them was an obstacle to their taking part in exercise. Women in Sport said it was “deeply concerned by the number of girls who disengage from sport and exercise post primary school”. It added that a further dip in engagement was found at age 17 to 18, once school sport was no longer compulsory. The report showed most girls understood the benefits of being active, and that they wanted to increase their levels of physical activity, but only 47% said they found it easy to motivate themselves. Stephanie Hilborne, the chief executive of Women in Sport, said: “It’s an absolute travesty that teenage girls are being pushed out of sport at such a scale.” She added that losing sport at this formative stage of their lives equated to a “loss of joy as well as good lifelong health”. “It is well documented that taking part in physical activity can have a profound and positive effect on mental wellbeing as well as providing many pivotal life skills such as resilience, teamwork and communication,” she added. “We must bust the myth that teenage girls drop out of sport simply because their priorities change. Our research has found that 59% of teenage girls who used to be sporty like competitive sport, but they’re being failed due to early-years stereotyping, inadequate opportunities and a complete dearth of knowledge about managing female puberty. “Teenage girls are not voluntarily leaving sport, they are being pushed out as a consequence of deep-rooted gender stereotypes. We must all do more to reverse this trend and not continue to accept this as inevitable.” The charity is calling for sport, leisure and education sectors to keep girls engaged in sport, especially during the transition from primary to secondary school and during puberty.",News/Education,More than 1 million girls in the UK lose interest in sport as teenagers,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/07/uk-girls-lose-interest-in-sport-as-teenagers-women-in-sport-survey

3/7/2022,"When Moon Jae-in, the outgoing president of South Korea, returned home from Washington in May last year, his foreign minister, Chung Eui-yong, rushed to clarify the mention of Taiwan in his joint statement with Joe Biden – a highly sensitive subject for South Korea’s biggest trading partner, China. “The Taiwan-related expressions [in the joint statement] are ‘very general expressions’,” Chung said a day after the statement was released. As if this clarification was not enough, Chung’s deputy, Choi Jong-gun, added: “China would appreciate the fact that South Korea does not see China as an enemy.” For South Korea, its position sandwiched between two great rival powers – the US and China – has been a notable discomfort for occupants of the presidential Blue House. The country of nearly 52 million people relies on Washington to provide security in facing North Korea’s constant provocation. China, meanwhile, is its top trading partner. ​Seoul’s decade-long balancing act between Beijing and Washington may no longer be as easy, said Gi-Wook Shin, director of the Shorenstein Asia-Pacific research centre at Stanford University. “You cannot ignore China … [but] given the recent rise of anti-Chinese sentiments among Koreans on top of the ongoing US-China conflict, finding ways to reconcile this situation with the reality of China as a key economic partner is a difficult question.” The opposition candidate, Yoon Suk-yeol from the main conservative People Power party, takes a more hawkish approach to China than Lee Jae-myung of the ruling Democratic party. In recent weeks, Yoon’s campaign has vowed to be more vocal on human rights and bring in a new terminal high altitude area defence (Thaad) missile defence system nearer to Seoul. It prompted analysts to recall memories of an earlier diplomatic incident with China in 2017. Lee’s view is that for a country of South Korea’s geography and economic reality, it is unwise to pick sides between the US and China – a typical dilemma of many mid-sized powers share in Asia these days. Yet Lee is also facing rising anti-China sentiment at home: 77% of South Korea’s public hold a negative view of China, according to a mid-2021 Pew survey. In 2015, it was only 37%. Ahead of the Winter Olympics last month, Shin found in a survey that more than 40% of his respondents supported the idea of South Korea engaging in a diplomatic boycott of the Games. The shift in South Korea’s thinking on China was marked by Beijing’s economic retaliation five years ago following Seoul’s installation of the Thaad system. Seoul said the move was aimed at North Korea, but Beijing saw the ultimate target of Thaad as China itself. After rounds of harsh economic counter measures against South Korea, Beijing finally forced Seoul to back down, but that also scarred South Korea’s public, who began to grow wary of China’s flexing its might. Months later, the then-foreign minister, Kang Kyung-wha, laid out a proposal of three “noes” in parliament. Two of them were no additional deployment of Thaad, and no forming a military alliance with the US and Japan. “China’s worst fears in dealing with the next South Korean president are Seoul’s deployment of another Thaad system, and South Korean potential participation in the ‘free and open Indo-Pacific’ initiative, which is led by the US and Japan,” said Liu Jiangyong, a north-east Asia expert at Beijing’s Tsinghua University. Liu said China would also pay close attention to Seoul’s approach to Pyongyang because it hoped to see stability in the Korean peninsula. “But ultimately, Beijing is wary that South Korea may be drawn to align itself with US and Japan’s current approach to Taiwan,” he added. Ramon Pacheco Pardo, a professor of international relations at King’s College, London, said South Korea was well aware of China’s potential economic retaliation as Seoul was being integrated into the US-led coalition to counter China’s influence. “But even if China comes up with another round of economic coercion, I don’t think South Korea would be as concerned,” he said. “This is because, first, since the last Thaad incident, South Korea has already begun to diversify its economy away from China by opening factories in Vietnam, for example; second, the public has begun to turn against China in the last few years – and in particular since the start of the Covid pandemic.” Pacheco Pardo added: “South Korea nowadays is more willing to take action, but not by itself, but with like-minded partners, such as the United States and Europe.” This means that whether it’s Yoon or Lee who wins the race to the Blue House on Wednesday, Seoul’s alliance with Washington will still be its top priority. Although labelled by Yoon as “pro-North, pro-China, anti-US”, Lee’s foreign policy adviser, Wi Sung-lac, said his country’s ties with the US had yet to achieve their full potential. This included potential collaboration with the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), another US-led initiative denounced by China as an example of “the cold war mentality”. This will pose a headache for Beijing. But Liu said his country was confident that whatever the next South Korean president’s China policy would be, Seoul still has to pay attention to its biggest trading partner. “There is no major conflict over the two countries’ core interests, after all.”",News/World news,South Korea’s presidential candidates face balancing act amid rising anti-China sentiment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/south-koreas-presidential-candidates-face-balancing-act-amid-rising-anti-china-sentiment
3/7/2022,"Scottie Scheffler successfully emerged from a golf tournament so attritional it was worthy of an X-rating. Rory McIlroy snapped a wedge in half. Adam Scott, the nicest man on the fairways, declined post-round media duties on the basis he had “nothing good to say”. Another of the world’s elite wandered around the Bay Hill car park, claiming to be “looking for the USGA sign”. This was indeed far more US Open than standard Tour stop. Scheffler will care little about the backdrop. A fourth round of 72 secured the Arnold Palmer Invitational by one, at five under par, from Tyrrell Hatton, Viktor Hovland and Billy Horschel. There was contrasting emotion therein. Hatton’s 69 was superb. Hovland could fare no better than plus five over the weekend. “This stings,” Hovland admitted. Horschel watched a 30ft putt slide by on the 72nd green. If it had gone in, he would have forced extra holes. Instead, Scheffler celebrated a second win within a month and three starts. A comfortable two-putt from 69ft on the final green emphasised the 25-year-old’s nerveless touch. So, too, did eight pars and a birdie on the back nine. Scheffler is the real deal. The subplot relates to how much this brutal battle – caused by thick rough, a whipping breeze and baked greens – will affect the thoughts of players returning. “I’m glad I’m off that golf course, I’m glad I’m done,” said Gary Woodland, who shared fifth. Golfers aren’t particularly of a mind to have their belief shattered immediately before the biggest non-major week of the year, at the Players Championship. McIlroy, whose temper had got the better of him at the 12th, admitted he was “venting” but believes course setup has to change. “I feel punch drunk,” said McIlroy after a 76. “The weekend, it’s like crazy golf. You just don’t get rewarded for good shots. I’m hitting good shots. I’m swinging the club well. I’m chipping well. I’m putting well. But it can knock your confidence whenever the conditions are like this. “I don’t mind golf courses being penal when you miss, but it’s not rewarding good shots. I think that’s where it starts to get across the line.” Horschel and Talor Gooch had shared the 54-hole lead at six under par. Gooch’s 77 left him in a share of seventh but there was the consolation of a place in this summer’s Open on account of his Bay Hill performance.",Sport/Sport,Scottie Scheffler survives ‘crazy golf’ to win Arnold Palmer Invitational,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/06/scottie-scheffler-survives-crazy-golf-to-win-arnold-palmer-invitational
