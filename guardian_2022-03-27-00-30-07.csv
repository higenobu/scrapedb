3/27/2022,"Thousands have gathered in central London to express solidarity with the people of Ukraine, who the capital’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, said had endured “unimaginable pain and suffering” over the past month. Following the rallying call by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, for people everywhere to protest against the bloodshed by taking to the streets, large crowds assembled in the capital to show support for the embattled country. On their route through London, demonstrators marched beneath Yoko Ono’s Imagine Peace message on a huge electronic billboard in Piccadilly, many waving the yellow and blue of the Ukrainian flag as they passed. Most of those gathered firmly believed that Ukraine would prevail in the ongoing brutal conflict against the forces of Vladimir Putin. Khan, who had organised the march to mark a month of Putin’s invasion and following Zelensky’s call for global support, told the Guardian that London stood “shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine in its darkest hour”. Later, the crowds congregated in Trafalgar Square, bedecked in the yellow and blue of Ukraine. Among those gathered was Izyma Savkina, who fled Ukraine’s capital Kiev last week. The 36-year-old said: “Eventually the Russians will kill Putin themselves. But in the meantime we need more air support and more weaponry from Nato.” Elsewhere friends, Yuliya Gavnylyuk, from Ivano-Frankivsk and Sofia Silina, from Zaporizhzhia also believed their country would ultimately win the war. “Absolutely, we will win. We are fighting for our freedom and for our homes,” said Gavnylyuk. Silina added that three of her family’s homes had been destroyed in the fighting and all they had left was their grandfather’s house, which he now guarded alone with a gun close to the frontline. When the conflict is over, they said, they will travel back to Ukraine for a huge party. As another day of fighting 1,600 miles to the east continued, a vigil was due to be held in Trafalgar Square with the crowd addressed by British, Ukrainian and European politicians. Hanya Dezyk, from the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain, said: “It has been incredibly difficult for Ukrainians living in the UK and across the world to see what is happening to our homeland, and the sight of people uniting in the streets in our name gives us hope and strengthens our resolve to fight for Ukraine’s freedom.” Celebrities were spotted offering their support. Among them was the actor Helen Mirren, who offered her thoughts to Ukraine during “this terrible time”. The actor added: “It’s important that we send a message of support so that Ukrainians know that they are not alone, and I’m proud that the people of London are standing together in their name this Saturday.” Julie Walters was another who said: “It’s important that the world unites to show them that they have our support in their time of need, and I’m so glad that London is joining as one to send a message of solidarity loud and clear.” Khan, who also announced more than £1.1m in funding to support refugees and people seeking asylum in London, added: “We have a proud history of providing sanctuary to those fleeing conflict, and this funding will ensure that support is there to help in their time of need.” The mayor said the money would help people affected by the invasion of Ukraine, as well as European Londoners, the Windrush generation and those hit by the lack of capacity within the asylum system. Anna Bird, the chief executive of the European Movement, added: “It’s time to unite across parties, organisations, faiths, beliefs and backgrounds to condemn this act of Putin’s aggression. Our duty is rooted in a belief that a closer, more united and peaceful Europe is in all of our interests.” Since Zelenskiy’s call for the world to show their support for his embattled country sizeable protests have occurred in the Netherlands and Ecuador and cities including Bulgaria’s Sofia, Krakow in Poland and Mexico City.",News/UK news,Thousands gather in London to show solidarity with Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/26/thousands-gather-in-london-to-show-solidarity-with-ukraine
3/27/2022,"Glorious sunshine ushered in a new era for the Women’s Six Nations but anyone not affiliated with England would have felt a cold shiver after a brutal display from the Red Roses in Edinburgh. Marlie Packer scored three tries with six of her teammates registering one apiece as the world No 1 team obliterated Scotland to begin their title defence in some style. It was a scrappy start, though, as passes failed to meet their intended destination and those that did were grassed. Scotland’s set piece and tenacity at the breakdown caused some early discomfort for England. But the indomitable machine soon spluttered into life and once it did there was only going to be one result. The rout began on eight minutes when the impressive Leanne Infante tapped quickly from a penalty and cut up field. Poppy Cleall brought it close to the line before Packer burrowed over for her 22nd try for her country. Cleall had one of her own shortly after thanks to England’s direct approach around the fringe with Packer punching holes in the tight channel. Emily Scarratt, playing her first Test in 11 months, converted to nudge England’s Six Nations tally beyond 4,000 points. Scotland replied with a wonderful score that began with a line-out on the right and ended with Chloe Rollie diving over near the left corner, but this was a rare riposte. Three England tries in nine minutes secured the bonus point and ended the contest. Helena Rowland may be a fly-half but she attacks the line and welcomes the collision like a back-rower. It was her dart that sucked in three defenders before an off-load unleashed Heather Cowell down the right. Not to be undone Abigail Dow ran in from 30 metres after a strong hand off and clever step and then Packer bagged her second from the back of a driving maul. “One of the things we wanted to add was unpredictability [to our attack],” coach Simon Middleton said of the variety of tries scored. “There was a bit of everything. We were fairly clinical when we got near the line. Lots of positives.” Scotland’s defence needs work. Tackles were too easily brushed aside and they were meek when countering England’s maul. But when they had the ball they showed patience and clean hands. What they lacked was penetration and England’s ruthlessness, as much as anything else, is a major point of difference. So too is their speed from the ruck. Infante’s distribution was electric throughout and she’d have a deserving try before the interval when prop Sarah Burn straightened, accelerated and off-loaded in the tackle like a centre. Scotland spent the first 10 minutes of the second half camped in England’s 22 but only had a disallowed try to show for it. England were not so wasteful. Their first foray up field saw Holly Aitchison collect Rowland’s bouncing chipped kick in the try area. Both teams rang the changes but none had a more immediate impact than Connie Powell. The replacement hooker was on the field less than a minute when she scored from the back of another unstoppable line-out maul. England has 30 full-time professional players to choose from. Scotland has none. This sobering fact explains so much and the effects played out in the closing quarter. A chasm in pace, power and fitness became apparent. Packer sealed her hat-trick on 65 minutes when she charged over from close range. Along with 13 carries and a perfect tackle success rate, the Saracens flanker backed up claims from Middleton that she is the best player in the world at present. Scotland refused to fade and fought hard to break their second-half duck. The scoreline doesn’t reflect their tenacity and contribution to an entertaining occasion. It does however send an ominous warning from England to the rest of the competition.",Sport/Sport,Marlie Packer scores hat-trick of tries in England’s obliteration of Scotland,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/26/scotland-england-womens-six-nations-rugby-union-match-report
3/27/2022,"The UK government has indefinitely detained two private jets belonging to sanctioned Russian oligarch Eugene Shvidler in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It comes after Shvidler, a close associate and business partner of Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, was sanctioned on a new list of measures aimed at 65 Russian oligarchs, banks and defence companies published on Thursday. The two jets have been under investigation at Farnborough and Biggin Hill airports for three weeks. But on Saturday the transport secretary said he had signed new laws to impound the jets and that make it a criminal offence for sanctioned plane owners to move or fly their aircraft. “Since Putin began his illegal assault, I’ve held jets belonging to Eugene Shvidler under investigation for three weeks. Now, I am using my powers to detain them indefinitely,” tweeted Grant Shapps. “Putin’s friends who made millions out of his regime will not enjoy luxuries whilst innocent people die.” Shvidler was a former boss and shareholder in Abramovich’s steel company, Evraz PLC. According to the government, his net worth has been estimated at £1.2bn. The UK government described Shvidler as a “longstanding business partner” of Abramovich, and that through his shares in Evraz, he had “been involved in obtaining a benefit from or supporting the government of Russia”. According to the Times, the two jets are a $45m (£34m) Bombardier Global 6500 jet, registered as an LX-Fly, which has been impounded at Farnborough airport. The other is a $13m (£9.8m) Cessna Citation Latitude jet at Biggin Hill. A private helicopter belonging to Russian company HeliCo Group LLC has also reportedly been seized. Shapps said in a statement: “Introducing these latest measures – detaining tens of millions of pounds worth of Russian private jets – shows this government will leave no stone unturned in depriving Putin’s cronies of their luxury toys.” The latest legislation means that all planes owned, operated or chartered by Russians are not permitted to fly or land in the UK. Russian ships have also been banned from entering British ports, with at least 10 ships reportedly having been turned away. The Department for Transport is also looking at a “small number” of yachts moored in the UK with suspected links to Russia. They are among a raft of sanctions imposed by western countries in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.",News/World news,UK detains two private jets belonging to sanctioned Russian oligarch,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/26/uk-detains-private-jets-eugene-shvidler-sanctioned-russian-oligarch
3/27/2022,"Beware the journalistic use of the word “we”. It’s a slippery pronoun that can slide from meaning “we, the whole of humanity” to “we, the author and some like-minded friends” to “we, an ill-defined mass who uphold an imaginary consensus that the author wishes bravely to oppose”. It’s out in force in the persistent and evidence-free claims that “woke wars”, as the Daily Telegraph’s Sherelle Jacobs put it last week, have gravely undermined “our” ability to confront the evils of Vladimir Putin. In the cold war, she claims, conflict with the Soviet Union was “confidently framed” as one between “the enlightened forces of liberty and the darkness of communism”. Now, “we” are tearing ourselves apart with “squabbles over statues and gender pronouns”. There are so many holes in this argument that it’s hard to know where to start. With the fact that what she calls “squabbles” might also be called free speech and the wish to defend minorities? Or that the cold war coincided with a much-squabbled-over expansion of rights for those same minorities, which rightwing commentators of the time, had the term existed, would assuredly have called “woke”? Or that tirades like hers oddly echo those of Putin himself against Russian “traitors” and western “cancel culture”? Or that the complicity of British conservative elites with oligarchic wealth might possibly be a more relevant issue vis-a-vis the Ukraine war than statue-toppling? If she really wants “us” to support Ukraine with a united home front, perhaps she can start by questioning her own newspaper, which claimed that the south London suburb of Tulse Hill was in danger of being “cancelled”, simply because the council had launched a consultation as to whether residents of the borough were troubled by the associations with slavery of local placenames. A well-known feature of lockdown, especially in big cities, was its quiet: almost no traffic noise, just the unchallenged and increasingly grating chimes of ice-cream vans. Now that things are roughly back to normal, busy roads resemble their former selves, but with the volume turned down. Enough cars, vans and buses are hybrid or electric that the pre-Covid roar has become a hum. They also make for cleaner air. Since town planning and property markets have been based for decades on the assumption that big roads are noxious, the effects could be profound: blasted thoroughfares are now potential boulevards, their wide margins ripe for pavement cafes, and homes huddled against the traffic will now be liberated, their views on to the wide-open spaces of urban motorways transformed into assets. This is an almost utopian prospect. There will still be ice-cream vans, though. This electric hush will mitigate, if not entirely vindicate, the works of Robert Moses, the man who, from the 1920s to the 1960s, wielded extraordinary power over the fabric of New York City. With the mild-sounding title of parks commissioner, he razed neighbourhoods to construct expressways, threw bridges over the city’s rivers and built vast housing projects. That he is the subject of a new play, Straight Line Crazy, written by David Hare and starring Ralph Fiennes, makes one wonder why such a dramatisation took so long. And where is the Hollywood movie? Perhaps the pitch “this is a film about a town planner” doesn’t play well in an elevator.

3/27/2022,"It’s 1990. Diplomats from North and South Korea are engaged in a bad-faith battle to jeopardise each other’s chances of political allegiances with the government of Somalia. But the staff of the two rival embassies are forced to cooperate when a civil war erupts. Loosely based on true events, this propulsively entertaining political thriller bears more than a passing resemblance to Ben Affleck’s Argo. The picture, a big-budget spectacle guided by the sure hand of action director Seung-wan Ryu (Crying Fist), is at its most effective when the hurtling camera is strafed by bullets. It’s less successful when the headlong pace falters to allow the screenplay to hammer home its message of collaboration and tolerance. “You think,” says one ambassador, weighing his words emphatically, “we can accomplish more together?” For the most part, though, this is bracingly enjoyable stuff – slickly edited, dryly humorous and shot with a bold yellow palette that somehow enhances the sense of panic.

She released her debut solo album, To Love Is to Live, in June 2020, and a duet album, Utopian Ashes, with Bobby Gillespie in 2021. She is also an actor and was nominated for best female newcomer at the 2019 César awards for her role in An Impossible Love. She stars in Jacques Audiard’s latest film, Paris, 13th District, and tours Europe this summer, including All Points East in London on 28 August. In the End, It Was All About Love by Musa Okwonga This walks the fine line between poetry and stream of consciousness. His writing is so precise, and although it’s very intimate, it also has that universal reach. It’s about an artist who moves from London to Berlin, and he describes the racism he experiences there. There’s a lot of introspection, but it’s not done in a navel-gazing way; it’s very touching and compassionate. It’s great when books can get you into somebody’s head and view the world as they see it, and still relate even though it’s very different from your own experience. I think that’s what books are made for. Titane (dir Julia Ducournau, 2021) Agathe Rousselle and I were the last two actresses to be considered for the lead role, and she got the part. Although in the film industry that could trigger some distance, we became friends, and we’re actually collaborating on a project. The film is great – I mean, it won the Palme d’Or. What I love about it is that it’s a French movie that draws a line and shows we don’t have to refer to the Nouvelle Vague – Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut, Éric Rohmer – here comes a new generation. It’s a film that really divides people, and I quite like that. I like movies that create an extreme reaction. Sex Education (Netflix) I was really thrilled when this came out. It’s a TV show I would have loved to have had when I was a teenager, that talks about teenage sexuality with, like the title says, an educational standpoint. And it has Ezra Furman’s soundtrack all over it – I’m a big fan of Ezra’s work. It’s very entertaining and has a great cast: Gillian Anderson is incredible in it and really funny. I remember when I was a teenager, I had a friend whose parents were sex therapists. And he was always very intriguing – that’s the kind of people you want to talk to. Anne Imhof: Natures Mortes, Palais de Tokyo, Paris This was a performance that lasted six hours. You wander through and discover different scenes with dancers, musicians, people being tattooed live. It’s a world in itself: time is different, the seconds are slower, no one moves fast, everything sort of stretches out. You never know when something is going to start or where: you just have to follow the movement of the crowd. With phones nowadays we’re never lost, we always know where we are going. But the freedom in that sensation of being lost was great. And the main singer and performer, Eliza Douglas, was incredible. Boxing I started boxing when I moved to Paris three or four years ago, after 12 years in London. It was hard to meet new people and the boxing club gave me that sense of community back. Boxing is an art. Like many sports, it demands your physical strength, but you also have to work on your mind, because you cannot win a match if you don’t believe you can. When I couldn’t go on tour because of Covid, boxing provided me another stage, another place where I could check where I’m at mentally and physically. Cillian Murphy I really admire Cillian Murphy. I like how discreet he is in life and how he doesn’t play the star game; there is a real quality to that because then he’s very believable in every role he plays. He’s great in Peaky Blinders, but I think his best performance is always going to be the one that’s coming next. He’s one of those actors who will never stop learning and never stop progressing.

3/27/2022,"Michael Gove’s Homes for Ukraine scheme risks operating as “Tinder for sex traffickers” according to experts. The warning comes as evidence emerges that UK-based criminals are targeting women and children fleeing the war. A letter from 16 refugee and anti-trafficking organisations to communities secretary Gove warns that the scheme in its present form is potentially dangerous for refugees who have fled Ukraine. It says the initiative, which allows would-be hosts to be matched with Ukrainians seeking sanctuary in the UK, effectively mimics the dating app Tinder’s signature “swipe left, swipe right” approach to rejecting or selecting a partner, and has insufficient safeguards. Initial evidence from the letter’s signatories, which include Refugee Action, Refugee Council and the Helen Bamber Foundation, said traffickers had already made apparent attempts to target Ukrainian women and children, as had slum landlords. Louise Calvey, head of safeguarding at charity Refugee Action, said she was aware of a UK resident wanting to offer accommodation only to an orphan, while another had asked to house a single Ukrainian woman because they wanted help with their childcare. Launched just over a week ago, Gove’s scheme prompted a huge response, with about 150,000 offers of support. However the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) has not said how many people have arrived in the UK under the scheme, saying it would “set out full details of the [number of] visas granted” this week. Some families who have applied to be sponsors have complained that the system is too complicated. Calvey said: “We are concerned that issues with the scheme means that it risks being a Tinder for sex traffickers. We are already aware of people with illegal motives who are advertising on social media.” Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: “We’ve had concerns from people in the Ukrainian community about dubious Facebook pages and other websites offering a matching service that looks like it might be run by people with an ulterior motive like trafficking, exploitation or unscrupulous landlords.” The letter, sent to Gove on Saturday, says: “By adopting a hands-off approach to matching, there is a high risk that traffickers, criminals and unscrupulous landlords set up matching sites and Facebook pages to prey upon the vulnerable.” Calvey also called for police to be brought in to regulate the scheme and target individuals and organised crime gangs seeking to prey on Ukrainian refugees. The National Crime Agency (NCA), which investigates trafficking, confirmed that it had not been asked by the government to regulate the scheme. Although Gove said initially that hosts would undergo “very light touch” criminal records checks, in fact all will be required to have undergone Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks. Yegor Lanovenko, who runs an organisation called Opora, which has drawn up a database for Ukrainians to view sponsors and has recorded 400,000 profile views in a week, said that criminals had also targeted UK residents who wanted to offer Ukrainians a home. “Everyone just went on Facebook, and posted their passports, houses, addresses with the obvious risks that creates and we’ve seen so many people saying: ‘I just posted on Facebook, now I’ve been scammed five times.’ Who thought that that was going to be a good idea?,” added Lanovenko Already reports from Poland indicate that women and child refugees who have just fled Ukraine are being targeted by pimps and sex traffickers operating alone and in gangs, according to charities working on the border. The letter from the 16 organisations “with substantive experience leading resettlement programmes, delivering hosting schemes, supporting refugees and in anti-trafficking” also warns that the scheme is storing up a housing crisis for the autumn: “We are concerned that this scheme, as currently structured, bakes in a refugee housing and support crisis for the autumn. With hosts only having a duty to accommodate refugees for six months, a heavy burden will be placed on local authorities to pick up the pieces if new housing is required.” The organisations, which also include the No Accommodation Network and Ecpat UK, say that 11,000 Afghans are stranded in hotels months after the fall of Kabul.

3/27/2022,"One month after Russian president Vladimir Putin asserted that Ukraine should be liberated from the historical mistake of its independence, the Russian defence ministry has announced that Russia’s war aims were limited to the Donbas region, and were nearing completion. This climbdown is undoubtedly laying the groundwork for selling the operation as a success to the Russian public despite an abysmal military combat performance. But that does not mean a rapid end to the war. Having failed in its initial attempts to seize several Ukrainian cities, and with its logistics in disarray, Russia has been forced to focus on one target at a time. Mariupol is the current main effort. Once that port city falls, Kharkiv is likely to be the next target, followed by an attempt to push north along the Dnieper River to cut off Ukrainian forces in the Donbas. If the Russians can hold Kherson, this would pave the way for a Russia-initiated ceasefire, with a link created between the Donbas and Crimea, and Russian propaganda claiming to have averted a fictional Ukrainian genocide against ethnic Russians in the Donbas. Even these more limited aims promise fierce fighting. Kharkiv – close to the Russian border – has already been subjected to heavy bombardment, whose intensity is likely to increase, and Ukraine has few options for preventing it. On the other hand, the fight northwards along the Dnieper will probably be met with stiff resistance, with continuing western arms supplies leading to heavy attrition among Russian armour. The outcome of this fighting is far from inevitable. It would be a serious error to expect the war to end at this point, however, even if local ceasefires and expanded negotiations suggest diplomacy may prevail. This is for three reasons. First, Putin’s view of Kyiv – as rightfully Russian territory – will not have changed. Just as the Russian military continually sought to destabilise Ukraine and kill its soldiers for the eight years between the annexation of Crimea and this year’s campaign, negotiations will not halt Russian aggression but merely shift its intensity and emphasis. Second, precisely because Russia is setting itself up to annex more Ukrainian territory so it cab claim victory at home, western sanctions are not going away. They will persist. The result is that Putin is rapidly losing all levers of influence in the west other than the application or threat of force. In this context, any lull in the fighting is likely to see the Russians seek to correct defects in their campaign plan, to regroup and to threaten a future campaign against Kyiv. The third reason why Russia’s new declared aims do not suggest an imminent end to hostilities is that, precisely because of the expectations of the first two points, Ukraine will not wish to see a ceasefire allow Russia to dig in along a new “line of contact”. This will amount to it taking the country bite by bite. Ukraine will seek to strengthen Kharkiv and try to prevent its encirclement, spoiling the staging area for Russia’s second objective after Mariupol. Ultimately, Kyiv will not feel secure until Putin is removed from power or the Russian army is broken, and to that end will seek to continue to kill Russian soldiers on Ukrainian soil, for as long as possible. Moreover, a general collapse in Russian forces is anticipated to offer the best chance for Ukraine to retake what was lost in 2014 and 2015. Having pulled Russia’s hand into a mangle, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has no intention of letting Russia take it out. Even if he wanted to, the Ukrainian government could do little to stop insurgency by Ukrainians in the occupied territories. For Ukraine’s international partners, these dynamics pose some difficult questions. Those seeking off-ramps may in fact be pressuring Ukraine to surrender longer-term advantages to Moscow. For Ukraine, Russia’s curtailed objectives offer the space for more maximalist ambitions. The question is whether the west shares them.

3/27/2022,"Joe Biden has risked the wrath of Vladimir Putin by offering Ukraine extra military support as Russian troops appeared to struggle to hold even the territory it has secured since the invasion began. The US president’s pledge over “further defence cooperation” was said to have been made during a meeting with Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, in Warsaw on Saturday. Biden’s administration has already made available $1bn worth of military lethal weapons, including Stinger anti-aircraft systems Javelin missiles, light anti-armour weapons. Volodmyr Zelenskiy has been pushing the US to also facilitate the transfer of MiG-29 fighter jets from Poland but the White House is yet to be convinced by the Ukrainian president’s arguments, fearing a widening of the conflict. The Kremlin had hinted on Friday that it may be scaling back its war ambitions, saying it was close to completing the “first phase” of its military campaign and would now focus on the complete “liberation” of Donbas in eastern Ukraine. Speaking to the Guardian, Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to President Zelenskiy and the lead negotiator in talks with Russia, said he did not believe that the Kremlin was downgrading its war aims. “They had poor operational planning, and they realised it was advantageous for them to surround cities, cut off the main supply routes, and force people there to have a deficit of food, water and medicines,” he said, describing the siege of Mariupol as a tactic to sow psychological terror and exhaustion. However, Podolyak expressed scepticism over the claim from the Russian defence ministry that Moscow’s forces would now focus mainly on the Donbas area in east Ukraine. “Of course I don’t believe that. They don’t have interests in Donbas. Their main interests are Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and the south – to take Mariupol, and to close the Azov sea … we see them regrouping and preparing more troops to send in,” he said. Earlier on Saturday, the Kremlin had again raised the spectre of the use of nuclear weapons in the war with Ukraine. Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president who is deputy chairman of the country’s security council, said Moscow could strike against an enemy that only used conventional weapons, while Putin’s defence minster Sergei Shoigu claimed nuclear “readiness” was a priority. Biden, who is due to make what is being billed as a major speech later on Saturday, met Kuleba and Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, in what was the first meeting between the US president and the Ukrainian leadership since the war began a month ago. The US expressed “unwavering commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” State department spokesman Ned Price said. Kuleba told reporters that Ukraine had received pledges from Biden and his secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, on developing defence cooperation. “We did receive additional promises from the United States on how our defence cooperation will evolve,” Kuleba said. “President Biden said what is happening in Ukraine will change the history of the 21st century, and we will work together to ensure that this change is in our favour, in Ukraine‘s favour, in the favour of the democratic world.” In his speech later on Saturday, the White House said Biden “will deliver remarks on the united efforts of the free world to support the people of Ukraine, hold Russia accountable for its brutal war, and defend a future that is rooted in democratic principles”. The meeting with the Ukrainian politicians took place at Warsaw’s Marriott Hotel in the city centre – opposite the central train station where there has been a constant flow of Ukrainian refugees since the conflict started. In some comments on Saturday, Biden said Poland was taking a “significant” responsibility in the humanitarian crisis and that the world should help lessen the burden. Biden has held three days of meetings with allies in the G7, Europe and Nato in recent days, and visited US troops in Poland on Friday.
