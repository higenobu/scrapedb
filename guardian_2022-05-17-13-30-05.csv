5/17/2022,"Scott Morrison has softened his language on wage rises as he faces mounting concern about the cost of living. The prime minister on Tuesday also urged drivers to dob in operators suspected of jacking up petrol prices. Morrison made the comments in the Northern Territory ahead of Wednesday’s release of the latest wage statistics, which will show whether the Reserve Bank’s prediction of an increase in pay has materialised. Last week, Morrison labelled Anthony Albanese a “loose unit” for endorsing a 5.1% increase for minimum wage workers, a rise of just $1 for workers on $20.33 an hour. Morrison has repeatedly claimed that Labor’s support for a real wage rise – one above inflation – would only add to “inflationary pressures”. On Thursday, he said that “any potential support you might have got and wages will be clawed back in even higher interest rates and even higher inflation”. On Tuesday, Morrison was asked why he was warning against a $1 an hour raise to the minimum wage while his government was proposing to unleash $5bn from first-home buyers’ superannuation to allow them to purchase $100bn of housing. Morrison told reporters in Zuccoli, in the seat of Lingiari, that the government was “supportive of wage rises”. “We think that wage rises are good things and we want to see the wage rises occur … on a sustainable basis, and the best way for that to happen is to get unemployment down, ensure the economy grows and that businesses are succeeding which enables them to provide sustainable wage rises for workers across this country,” he said. Morrison said that seven of the last eight minimum wage decisions by the Fair Work Commission resulted in real increases, compared to only three of six under Labor – despite minimum wages being set by the independent umpire. Morrison is under pressure over cost of living due to runaway inflation, tipped to reach 5.5% by mid-year and 6% by year’s end. In its May statement on monetary policy, the Reserve Bank claimed its business liaison was reporting employers “are paying larger wage increases or that they expect materially higher wages growth over the coming year”. But Wednesday’s release of the wage price index looms as a threat to Morrison because if the figures do not show an increase in wage growth, Labor will renew its criticism that “the cost of everything is going up except your wages”.

Instead, he referred to earlier comments from the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, that only an estimated $5bn would be removed from super. Morrison later told Today Extra the policy was “informed by Treasury analysis”. On Mix 104.9 Darwin, Morrison was grilled about why petrol prices were stubbornly high despite the government temporarily halving the excise tax in the budget, a cut of 22 cents per litre for six months. Morrison claimed there were “strong laws” to ensure petrol stations pass savings on to consumers, warning they “can be prosecuted”. He suggested listeners report “specific bowser prices” to the competition regulator. Prices “will move around – they go up and down”, he said.",News/Australia news,Scott Morrison softens language on minimum wage rise amid pressure on cost of living,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/17/scott-morrison-backtracks-on-minimum-wage-rises-amid-pressure-on-cost-of-living
5/17/2022,"The satellite and drone imagery from above Bilohorivka tells a tale of folly and destruction. Dozens of Russian tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and trucks lay destroyed, some sinking into the waters of the Donets River by a broken pontoon bridge, pointing to the latest disaster in Russia’s three-month war in Ukraine. The toll of Russia’s attempts to cross the river, part of its costly offensive in the east, are staggering: more than 485 killed and as many as 80 vehicles destroyed, according to one estimate, although no numbers of casualties have been confirmed. As Russia continues to hide the scale of its losses in Ukraine, more and more information has leaked out, angering the families of Russian soldiers and discouraging even previous supporters of the invasion. “I look at my government totally different since the war started,” said Tatyana Efremenko, 39, whose son Nikita Efremenko was a conscript on the Moskva missile cruiser when it was sunk in a Ukrainian missile strike one month ago. She is still searching for her son. “There are some very harsh things I would like to say about our leadership, but maybe best if I don’t because they would put me in prison for it.” In Russian-controlled east Ukraine, wives of fighters have complained on camera that their husbands were left behind as Russian soldiers retreated across the border near Kharkiv. “They aren’t deserters, just those who managed to get away with their lives,” one woman yelled at a local official. Kyiv has said that it has the remains of thousands of Russian soldiers, but Moscow won’t accept them because that would force it to admit the high death toll in the war. As evidence of the Bilohorivka rout became clear over the last week, even some pro-Russian cheerleaders appeared to be losing faith in the wisdom of the country’s military leadership. “Until we know the name of the ‘military genius’ who put a battalion tactical group by the river and he doesn’t answer for it publicly, then there will never be reforms in the army,” wrote Vladlen Tatarzky, the pseudonym used by a Russian blogger and former soldier who has more than 300,000 subscribers on Telegram. He has generally supported the war. “How can one not remember comrade Stalin here, who despite the difficult military situation was not afraid to take difficult personnel decisions? If this isn’t done, then no mobilisation will save us.” Rob Lee, a senior fellow in the Foreign Policy Research Institute’s Eurasia Program who documented some of that backlash to the war, noted that another popular blogger wrote that it was “idiocy or sabotage to make such a mistake three months into the war”. And Igor Girkin, a Russian proxy field commander during the 2014 war who has been critical of the government during this conflict, appeared to feel vindicated: “I have already said several times what needs to be done in the current situation, when it has become clear that our forces are unable to deliver even a limited defeat to the enemy in ground combat and when we must prepare for a drawn-out, difficult, full-scale war.” A month after the sinking of the Moskva, the Russian government has only confirmed the death of one crew member and said another 27 were missing. But the families of crew members say that the death toll could be as high as 200, and many have not received any confirmation about what happened to their husbands, brothers, and sons. “No one is telling me anything,” said Efremenko, whose son disappeared on the ship, in an interview. “They asked me to sign a document which says I accept that my son died and then they want to compensate me for his death. They have sent the same document to all the parents of all the other missing conscripts, too.” Efremenko said that she was in a Telegram chat with more than 80 family members of those who were missing. Many have been told not to speak to the press or go public. “They are trying to buy my silence, but it won’t happen,” she said. “I will look for my son until the end. “I promised the authorities that I wouldn’t talk publicly about my son, but already a month has passed and people are forgetting about Moskva. People are moving on, but we still have so many unanswered questions: why the hell were conscripts there? Why were they fighting? No one has been able to tell me this.” On Monday, the Ukrainian government also released new data claiming that Russia’s 1st Guards Tank Army lost a staggering 131 tanks in just the first three weeks of the war, one of the bloodiest periods of combat for the Russian army. The data on personnel and vehicle losses for the unit “could be genuine”, said Michael Kofman, research programme director in the Russia studies programme at the CNA thinktank. Russia last released casualty data in late March, admitting that 1,351 Russian soldiers had been killed and 3,825 wounded in the first month of the war. The government has not released any more information on casualties in the last month and a half, except to say that they were “significant”. Western estimates have been 10 or even 20 times as high, with some suggesting that Russia has lost more than 30,000 soldiers since the beginning of the war. Kofman wrote: “Numbers get thrown about with broad ranges, and it is hard to say what to make of these estimates, or guesstimates.” As Ukrainian forces launch a counterattack that has reached the Russian border near Kharkiv, Russian soldiers are also being accused of abandoning their allies from the Donbas region of Ukraine. Video reportedly shot in the Luhansk region showed women surrounding a local official and pleading for him to help their family members. “They aren’t being allowed on to Russian territory,” said one woman. “They didn’t give in. They were completely destroyed.” The descriptions matched some images of mobilised conscripts from the Russian-controlled territories of Donetsk and Luhansk who were pictured with light body armour and Mosin–Nagant rifles that are badly outdated on a modern battlefield. “They’re facing tanks and all they had were pistols,” the woman said.",News/World news,‘I look at my government differently’: losses in Ukraine test Russians’ faith,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/17/i-look-at-my-government-differently-losses-in-ukraine-test-russians-faith
