5/12/2022," An article said that Barclays bank may have saved £1.9bn by avoiding paying taxes at 25%-30% from 2013-21. However, when calculating the potential savings at the exact tax rates, the figure is closer to £1.8bn (Barclays avoided almost £2bn in tax via Luxembourg scheme, 9 May, p27).

5/12/2022,"A California non-profit started an ambitious project beneath the surface of Lake Tahoe: hire scuba divers to gather the litter in the top 25 ft of the lake. Divers have now pulled out more than 25,000 pounds of debris from the 72 miles of the lake’s shoreline, working in a circle from Stateline, Nevada. As volunteer divers navigated the lake, they plucked plastic bottles, engagement rings, 1980s Nikon film cameras, entire lampposts, “no littering” signs, big pieces of broken-down boats and engine blocks, lost wallets and cordless home telephones, according to Clean Up the Lake. The founder and executive director of the group, Colin West, said he organized a beach cleanup in 2018, when volunteers recovered 40lb of litter from the shoreline near the popular King’s Beach. He chatted with some friends who were doing an underwater cleanup and they had recovered 600lb of litter from beneath the surface. A light went off for him, West says: “How did all that litter make it under the surface of such a beautiful lake?” His team of volunteers started doing surveys, and they found more than 50lb of trash a diver each time they went out. They later launched the 72 Mile project to clean up the lake. The divers are supported by boats and jet skis. On any given day, the non-profit organizes 10 people on the water. They have completed 189 dives in 81 days. Lake Tahoe is more than 1,600ft deep in some parts. Pollution from algae and fine sediments have muddied the lake’s famously clear blue waters. The lake’s clarity declined 30%, from 100 ft to 64 ft, between 1968 and 1997, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. As the climate gets hotter and less rain falls, the lake may also be threatened in unique ways: its waters warmed 15 times faster recently than the average rate over the previous century. Picking up trash will not affect these more systemic issues, but it does make people think more about the ecology of the area, the group says. The divers didn’t go deeper than 25 ft to retrieve items, though they geotagged bulkier, deeper trash for later removal. When looking at the litter – including anchors, tires and ropes – it’s easy to feel like people are making bad decisions, West said. But the majority of debris is accidental litter that has wound up there through normal human activities. “You might find five or six beer cans in one area,” he said. “But the sunglasses, the cellphones, the hats, the construction material – a lot of this has happened accidentally or from wind storms. No one is trying to lose a boat anchor.” Some of the garbage will be used to create a new art installation at a nearby events center. In the future, the project plans to expand to three other lakes, including June Lake in the Mammoth Lakes region and Fallen Leaf Lake in the Tahoe basin. Divers will also be collecting data on invasive species and algae blooms while in the water. They also want to monitor the situation after the cleanup to determine if it has changed for the better, or if it is back to the junk. West wants to see increased litter prevention signs, trash receptacles, and education. “We are all part of the problem – whether you are on a boat or building a house,” says West. “So we need to be part of the solution as well.”",News/US news,"Lampposts, rings, cameras: over 25,000 pounds of junk cleared from Lake Tahoe",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/11/lake-tahoe-california-cleanup
5/12/2022,"Liz Truss has been warned of a major rebellion over plans for a bill that could revoke parts of the Northern Ireland protocol, amid fresh concern in Washington over the UK’s approach. European Union insiders have warned that the British government’s threat to abandon parts of the Northern Ireland protocol risks undermining the international alliance against Vladimir Putin. Officials in Brussels were “flabbergasted” at the timing of an intervention from the UK foreign secretary, who issued a statement on Tuesday night saying she would “not shy away” from taking unilateral action on the protocol. The bill, which could be revealed next Tuesday, is expected to be discussed by cabinet ministers on Thursday. Doubling down on Truss’s remarks, Michael Gove warned the EU that “no option is off the table”, after the UK argued the solution put forward by Brussels last October would worsen food shortages. Between 30 and 50 Conservative MPs canvassed by colleagues said they had significant doubts about whether they could vote for a bill that would unpick an international treaty. Most dismissed the prospect of the bill’s success and described it as a negotiating tactic. Senior MPs warned there were a number of ministers prepared to resign if faced with passing the bill into law. Sources close to Truss have stressed no final decision has been made and that any potential legislation is intended to run in parallel with further talks. The Northern Ireland minister Conor Burns, styled under a new title of special representative to the US on the NI protocol, was dispatched to Washington this week to speak to senior US figures about the negotiations. They were reported to have been blindsided by the leak of the proposed bill to the Times earlier this week. Burns arrived in Boston on Monday before travelling to DC for meetings with the state department and the senior director at the NSC, Amanda Sloat, as well as some senators and representatives from the influential Friends of Ireland group. One source described Burns as being keen to point out his close friendship with Boris Johnson. A White House spokesperson said: “We recognise that there have been challenges over the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol and that talks continue between the UK and EU to resolve these issues. “President Biden has long made clear his strong support for the Belfast/Good Friday agreement. We underscore our continued support for a secure and prosperous Northern Ireland in which all communities have a voice and enjoy the gains of the hard-won peace.” In Westminster, MPs said there was already a strong opposition forming against the principle of the bill, but said most were prepared to stomach difficult negotiating tactics. But they said they expected senior voices to speak out if it went ahead, including one ex-minister who said the former prime minister Theresa May would go further than she had over the Internal Markets bill which had provoked a number of resignations but was pulled last year. May made a stern intervention on the plans in the House of Commons and MPs described her comments as “opening fire” for more widespread Tory concern. Tobias Ellwood, chair of the defence select committee, said there was widespread concern about the proposed legislation. “Abandoning the protocol is self-defeating. It plays into Sinn Féin’s narrative that a united, peaceful Ireland is better for Northern Ireland,” he told the Guardian. “Binning the protocol will provoke a trade war with the EU at a time when the UK has done so well in leading the European response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It will mean fewer movement of goods and higher inflation.” Most MPs said they would wait to see how much the proposed bill was a device to reignite negotiations. Another MP said there was “huge difference between making preparatory steps as a negotiating tactic which some would understand – and going as far as to whip colleagues to break from an international treaty”. A third said: “As long as it’s posturing, it’s tolerable. If they go through with breaking the protocol there will be opposition.” Another former minister said they believed Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, had significant concerns about escalatory action by the EU – which has said it could suspend the free trade agreement. “The last thing the Treasury needs is that pressure on supply chains.” EU leaders have also voiced alarm. Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign affairs minister, said that Truss’s briefing to the press had gone down “really badly” in Europe warning that unilateral action would plunge the UK into a new war, and potentially a trade war with the EU. The EU had been expecting UK ministers to ramp up their approach after the public comments from Johnson and Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees-Mogg to bring forward “reforms.” Broadly the threats were seen as sabre-rattling designed to achieve leverage for the UK side ahead of the resumption of talks between Truss and the EU’s Maros Sefcovic. But in the past 24 hours relations have deteriorated with Coveney saying the “partnership” that has kept Northern Ireland stable is “absent at the moment”. Speaking on a visit to Sweden, Johnson told BBC News there was no need for major EU retaliation. His spokesperson declined to say if the government had modelled the potential economic cost of a trade war. Talks between the UK and the EU about the protocol are about to resume following a pause for the Northern Ireland elections. If the UK abandoned the protocol, the EU could take legal action and restart previous litigation against the UK that the European Commission paused last July, as well as potentially imposing tariffs on British goods or even suspending the EU-UK free-trade agreement.",News/UK news,Liz Truss’s plan to revoke NI protocol ‘splits allies and risks trade war’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/11/liz-truss-warned-over-bill-to-scrap-parts-of-northern-ireland-protocol
5/12/2022,"The Treasury has been forced to dampen speculation of an imminent announcement on the cost of living for a second successive day, after Boris Johnson hinted to Tory MPs that the government was poised to cut taxes. MPs said the prime minister had gestured at the idea of tax cuts to help struggling households, including at a Downing Street garden party for backbenchers. Chair of the Northern Research Group, Jake Berry, told Sky News the PM was “showing more than a bit of ankle” to colleagues on tax cuts. A Treasury source played down the idea, however, suggesting that in his conversations with MPs, Johnson had simply been “echoing the chancellor’s ambition to cut taxes for people”, which Rishi Sunak had set out at his spring statement. It followed Johnson’s suggestion in the House of Commons on Tuesday that he and Sunak would say more about the cost of living “in the coming days”, which led to speculation of an imminent Treasury statement. One former minister said Johnson’s comments to colleagues had not seemed fully formed or coordinated with the Treasury, and said it added weight to the prospect that Sunak could be moved at a reshuffle in the summer. It is understood the chancellor is privately examining options for measures that could be announced before the summer recess, when it has become clearer how much energy regulator Ofgem will allow bills to increase in October – though it is unclear whether these will be substantive enough to satisfy the PM. Johnson will hold a cabinet meeting in Staffordshire on Thursday in an attempt to underline his government’s mission of levelling up the UK. Asked about the cost of living on a visit to Finland on Wednesday, he said: “We will have the maximum energy, effort and ingenuity to help the British people. You know the money we’re already spending. Of course there will be more support in the months ahead, as things continue to be tough with the increase in energy prices.” One person with knowledge of the Treasury’s thinking said: “The chance of doing something sooner rather than later is on the up.” They suggested a temporary VAT cut was unlikely, because it would push up inflation whenever it is reversed. Instead, options could include directly compensating users for the increase in energy bills – particularly if the rise is not as severe as had been feared before recent falls in the wholesale gas price – or extending the council tax rebate many households received in April. Meanwhile, cabinet ministers have been asked to come up with deregulatory measures that could cut costs for consumers without requiring Sunak to sign off on more spending, with the first of these likely to be announced within days. Some MPs would like to see the income tax cut Sunak has promised for 2024 brought forward; but with 80% of the benefit going to the top half of earners, it would do little to alleviate poverty. Calls from MPs from across the Tory party for the government to take a more generous approach have intensified since last week’s disappointing local election results. “The pressure on Rishi is huge, at the moment,” said former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who has called for universal credit to be increased to help the lowest paid. He said the Bank of England’s decision to raise interest rates last week meant the Treasury should loosen the purse strings to prevent the economy sliding into recession. “You’ve got to keep growth going,” he said. “You have to loosen fiscal policy: the Treasury have got it completely wrong.” Carlisle MP John Stevenson said he expected the government to do more, particularly for the poorest. “Help has to be realistic, therefore targeted at the least well off,” he said. “Universal credit is possible, also another look at council tax or the taxes on energy are the sensible options.” Wycombe MP Steve Baker called for policy changes, including tax cuts and deregulation, to kickstart growth. “In the short run, I am always going to be worried about too many constituents not being able to eat, or heat their homes: that’s why I wanted to maintain the £20 universal credit uplift,” he said. “But in the long run, it’s very clear that the welfare state is not going to meet longstanding spending pledges. That’s why the PM must go for growth.” Michael Gove was criticised on Wednesday for putting on a series of accents, when asked about speculation of a split between Johnson and Sunak. He said on TV: “It is an example of some commentators chasing their own tails and trying to take a statement that is common-sensical, turning it into a ‘major’ capital letters ‘big news story’. “When the Treasury quite rightly say ‘calm down’, people instead of recognising that they have overinflated the story in the first place then say: ‘Oh, this is clearly a split.’” Responding to Gove’s interview, in which at one point he appeared to be imitating a Liverpudlian character played by the comedian Harry Enfield, Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, said: “Is the cost of living crisis just a joke to them? This is not a serious government.”",News/Business,Boris Johnson’s hints about tax cuts played down by Treasury,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/11/boris-johnson-hints-tax-cuts-treasury-rishi-sunak-cost-of-living-crisis
