2/3/2022,"Pre-market trading suggests Meta could lose $190 billion in market value when Wall Street opens Thursday. The company posted disastrous fourth-quarter earnings after markets closed on Wednesday. A drop in market cap of $190 billion in a day would be the largest in US corporate history. Meta could be facing the largest one-day wipeout in US corporate history on Thursday after posting a shock earnings report Wednesday. Its valuation could slump by more than $190 billion when Wall Street opens Thursday, if pre-market losses carry over into regular trading. After markets closed on Wednesday, Meta, formerly known as Facebook, said in its fourth quarter earnings report that Facebook's daily active user base shrank for the first time in its history. Meta also reported $10 billion in operating losses from its nascent metaverse business. By 6.58 a.m. ET on Thursday, Meta's stock was down by 21.59% in pre-market trading, suggesting that the company could be valued at $704.5 billion when markets open. This would be down from its $898.5 billion market capitalization when markets closed Wednesday. Out-of-hours trading in a stock isn't the same as regular trading. Pre-market and after-hours trading indicate how a comparably small number of investors value a company when stock markets are closed, and may not reflect the valuation given when markets open. As such, Meta's official valuation may be larger or smaller when the New York Stock Exchange opens at 9.30 a.m. ET. Facebook already holds the record for the largest one-day loss in value in US corporate history. In July 2018, the company shed $119 billion in market cap in a single day after reporting slowing growth in its second quarter earnings.

2/3/2022,"A Nevada woman and her friend are under arrest after deputies say they found two children living in appalling conditions. On Monday morning, authorities with the Washoe County Sheriff’s Office responded to reports for a welfare check at the Lemmon Valley residence, according to their press release. Deputies found Lindsay Arnold, 29, and her friend, Christa Garcia, 46, in “deplorable living conditions and with nearly three dozen dogs.” Arnold’s two children, ages 7 and 9, were also found at the Reservoir Street address. According to the release, the family lived in two out of three bedrooms in a sublet basement of 900 square feet. “When deputies arrived, they discovered two children, aged 7 and 9, living in a small bedroom with 18 dogs,” authorities stated. “The children were noticed to have old and new dog bites and/or scratches on their bodies.” In a second bedroom, Arnold and Garcia lived with another 15 dogs. An “uninvolved third party” rented the third bedroom and had a dog of their own. According to the release, the two children were forced to sleep on a “deflated air mattress covered in dog feces.” “The entire basement floor was covered with clothing, trash, and animal feces,” authorities stated. The children were removed from the home and placed with relatives. Arnold and Garcia were arrested the same day, according to the release. Arnold faces two felony counts of child abuse, neglect, or endangerment, while Garcia was charged with two gross misdemeanor counts of child abuse, neglect, or endangerment. It is not clear at this time whether either of the suspects have retained legal representation. Washoe County Regional Animal Services rescued 34 dogs from the home and subsequently opened an animal hoarding case, the release continued.

2/3/2022,"NEW DELHI (AP) — India will not attend Friday's opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympics, after one of the torchbearers reportedly chosen by Chinese authorities riled up New Delhi's anger. India's foreign affairs spokesman Arindam Bagchi on Thursday said it was “regrettable that the Chinese side has chosen to politicize an event like the Olympics.” The move followed reports in China's state-owned Global Times that a Chinese military commander, who was involved in deadly clashes with Indian border forces in 2020, had been chosen as one of many torchbearers charged with relaying the Olympics flame to Beijing. The 2020 fighting erupted along the disputed border with China in eastern Ladakh. Chinese troops killed 20 Indian soldiers, while China said it lost four soldiers. The spokesman added that the Indian Embassy in Beijing would also not send a representative to the closing ceremonies. The U.S., along with several countries including Australia, Britain and Canada, have announced a diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympics, citing China’s human rights violations, while allowing their athletes to compete. India has one athlete who's qualified to compete at the Games, according to spokesman Bagchi.",World/Associated Press,"Riled up by torchbearer, India skips China Olympics opening",https://news.yahoo.com/riled-torchbearer-india-skips-china-132244455.html
