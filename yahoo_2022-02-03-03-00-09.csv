2/3/2022,"Derrick Gibson, the Republican gubernatorial candidate for New York, told Assemblymember Yuh-Line Niou to “Go back to China” before daring her to call him a racist in a Tweet on Monday.

Niou responded, “You’re a racist.”
 
 Go back to China. Now call me a racist https://t.co/gElqAJMcwM

The 38-year-old Taiwanese American politician had posted a tweet earlier that day about a large group of New York City police officers riding the subway without masks.

“It honestly takes a lot to take a heartbreaking tragedy and a family’s moment of mourning and turn it into a frightening show of intimidation for the whole city and be a massive health risk to every New Yorker,” Niou wrote. “But they somehow did it.”

“Go back to China. Now call me a racist,” Gibson wrote in response to the tweet.

The officers came from a memorial for New York City police officer Jason Rivera, who was killed after responding to a domestic violence call late last month. The unmasked officers drew criticism from other social media users who stated that the memorial should not be considered an excuse to potentially endanger the safety and wellbeing of other subway passengers.

In a separate tweet, Gibson said he also never wears a mask while using public transportation, then went on to “encourage others not to either, it’s all a scam.”
 


Twitter users were quick to defend Niou and condemn Gibson for the racist tweet.

“Whenever someone tells another to 'go back to' their country, no matter the nationality/race, yes, that would clearly be considered racist,” one Twitter user commented. “Now imagine if someone said that to you or your family. How would you feel??”

“Why should someone call you it or point it out when you clearly, through your words, realize that is exactly what you are,” another wrote.

When Niou called Gibson “a racist” in response to his tweet, Gibson reacted with a series of tweets:
  Thanks for the acknowledgment. You have no place in our government. https://t.co/GKMaJKMITv  — Derrick Gibson (@Gibson4NYS) February 1, 2022    You blocked me because you don’t like to be corrected. Your statement is a shame and you need to be removed from your position. https://t.co/GKMaJKMITv  — Derrick Gibson (@Gibson4NYS) February 1, 2022    You’re a cop hater. https://t.co/7EN9tg0QkI  — Derrick Gibson (@Gibson4NYS) February 1, 2022    Yep. https://t.co/7EN9tg0QkI  — Derrick Gibson (@Gibson4NYS) February 1, 2022    Gibson, a self-declared MAGA Republican, acknowledged ""yes"" to Niou saying ""You're a racist,"" and also called her a “cop hater.”  According to Gibson, Niou has “no place in our government,” adding, “Your statement is a shame and you need to be removed from your position.”  While Gibson has stated on his website that he believes “exceptional morals are the backbone of any political campaign & that must start with the candidate,” he has long been a vocal supporter of the Proud Boys, a “right-wing extremist group with a violent agenda” whose members are “primarily misogynistic, Islamophobic, transphobic and anti-immigration,” according to the Anti-Defamation League.  Republican candidate for New York Governor, Derrick Gibson, said he is with the Proud Boys “100%” and he may join them.  Gibson said the Proud Boys and others arrested for January 6th are being persecuted “the same way they did Black people during slavery.” pic.twitter.com/7qfsfCVH52  — Resist Programming 🛰 (@RzstProgramming) June 14, 2021    In an interview with The Daily Beast last year, Gibson explained that he associates himself with the Proud Boys to “generate conversation,” saying, “I don’t have an issue with Proud Boys, so yeah, I put that out there so I could get a conversation started. To me, it’s not a hate symbol, and I know because I did my research. Now if it was Nazi symbols, I would not use something like that, because that was used to do the Jews in and I do not go for anything like that.”  Featured Image via Thought Villains Enjoy this content?

2/3/2022,"OPINION: Florida’s governor, a potential 2024 presidential candidate, has been on a proverbial warpath against everything—from banning mask and vaccine mandates and the teaching of critical race theory to suppressing voting rights. I know I am asking a rather loaded question. But it is one for which I have been desperately searching for answers. Florida is off the chain: neo-Nazi rallies, anti-CRT sentiments, debates on banning books, bans on vaccines and mask mandates and attacks on voting rights and fair elections. But worse than the state itself is its young Yale and Harvard Law-educated governor, Ron DeSantis. Florida’s governor has been on the proverbial warpath against, well, everything. Yet, this man is the most likely 2024 Republican nominee, in my opinion. He is the new darling of the conservative right. Bold. Brash. A braggart. He’s has called teaching about the impact of race in American history “crap.” And he carps on and on about protecting freedoms and rights by attacking science, mask-wearing and vaccines as Florida has surged with COVID cases, hospitalizations and tragically, deaths. Gov. DeSantis sounds a lot like someone else we know who lives in Florida—“the former guy” as he is now referred to on social media (“TFG,” aka Donald Trump). So let me break down some of the more concerning facts about this GOP rising star and why it should scare the hell out of us all. Let’s start with this most recent factoid: Just this past month, Florida legislators introduced a bill that would protect white citizens from feeling discomfort with teachings about America’s racial past. DeSantis said this about critical race theory: “In Florida, we are taking a stand against the state-sanctioned racism that is critical race theory. We won’t allow Florida tax dollars to be spent teaching kids to hate our country or to hate each other. We also have a responsibility to ensure that parents have the means to vindicate their rights when it comes to enforcing state standards. Finally, we must protect Florida workers against the hostile work environment that is created when large corporations force their employees to endure CRT-inspired ‘training’ and indoctrination.” This statement happened in December when DeSantis announced the Stop the Wrongs to Our Kids and Employees, the so-called Stop W.O.K.E. Act, a legislative proposal that he and Republicans say will give businesses, employees, children and families the “tools” to fight back against woke indoctrination (*rolls eyes*). Further, he purports that the Stop W.O.K.E. Act will be the strongest legislation of its kind in the nation and will take on both corporate wokeness and critical race theory. This proposal by DeSantis builds on his previous actions to ban CRT and the New York Times’ 1619 Project in Florida’s schools. DeSantis has embraced the phrase “Let’s go Brandon”—a euphemism for a vulgar attack on President Biden. He tortures Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the chief medical adviser to the president, by selling “Don’t Fauci My Florida” merch and “Freedom Over Fauci” flip-flops. Another scary example of how out of control DeSantis and his Florida team of Republicans are was the reactions to the neo-Nazi rally that happened this past weekend. As other state legislators and even U.S. Sen. Rick Scott condemned the disgusting display of hatred toward Jews in Florida, the press secretary for Gov. DeSantis tweeted this: “Do we even know they are Nazis?” Christina Pushaw wrote in a now-deleted tweet, according to FloridaPolitics.com. Her point was to compare these horrid creatures openly spewing hateful rhetoric at Jews to what the Lincoln Project did this past fall in Virginia at a rally for then-gubernatorial candidate Glenn Youngkin—where they posed as neo-Nazis from the Charlottesville, Va., “Unite the Right” rally in 2017. This was a response from a spokesperson for the chief executive of a state, which has a very large Jewish population. It’s insane! Let’s just call it what it is: Gov. DeSantis is Trump lite. He is maybe even worse. Why? Because, unlike Trump, he doesn’t really engage in the hyperbolic insults, offensive racial talk and animus that Trump does. He is smarter. Smoother. Slicker. He makes jokes. He positions himself as a champion of freedom and individual liberties, while all the while he’s suppressing them. But to me, what makes DeSantis the most dangerous is that, in a state like Florida, where an evil horror like the Rosewood massacre took place in 1923, he lacks any understanding of that history and its Jim Crow vestiges in his own state. An entire peaceful Black community was wiped out and murdered by a band of white racists who burned their community down, buried their bodies and covered it up for decades—until history came calling, and my former law firm, Holland & Knight LLP, took up the case and won reparations for the victims. One of my mentors, Martha Barnett, was the lead counsel and the former president of the American Bar Association. DeSantis has been a George Wallace-like figure trying to undo voting rights and the balanced teaching of race, history and civil rights in America. Case in point: Last May, DeSantis asked the Florida legislature to pass a restrictive voting rights bill. He signed into law the controversial voting bill, joining a host of other GOP-led states pushing new limits on voting in support of former President Trump’s baseless claims of fraud in the 2020 election. In signing the bill during an appearance on Fox & Friends, the Florida Republican highlighted provisions of the bill, including stricter voter ID requirements for voting by mail, creating limits on who can pick up and return completed ballots and banning private funding for elections. He was very proud of himself. Here’s the bottom line, as we all continue to focus on “TFG,” we have a much more dangerous problem brewing. His name is Gov. Ron DeSantis. We had all better make sure that in 2024, this man and the other guy get nowhere near the White House. Or Democracy may just end. Sophia A. Nelson is a contributing editor for theGrio.

2/3/2022,"A Taco Bell employee is garnering all kinds of praise thanks to one woman’s now-viral TikTok. On Jan. 31, Annely Elizibeth (@hereforyoutowastemytime) posted the teary-eyed clip, seemingly recorded just after a difficult breakup. As she explains in the video, all she wanted was to end her “really bad” night with some Taco Bell — and the restaurant’s employees ended up giving her more help than she imagined.  It’s just the latest viral TikTok to highlight the kindness of food service workers. Recently, an Instacart driver drew praise after a Ring camera caught them taking out a customer’s trash while they were sick with COVID. Before that, an Uber Eats customer shared the handwritten letter a driver left along with her food.  Elizibeth’s experience wasn’t captured on video, but her reaction was. In her TikTok, she explains what happened when the Taco Bell employees saw her roll up to the drive-thru after her breakup. As Elizibeth explains in the clip, Taco Bell was temporarily closed when she showed up — although the kitchen was still open for DoorDash and Uber Eats orders.  “I was like, ‘OK, I’ll wait because I’m really depressed, and all I want is Taco Bell,'” Elizibeth says. After hearing that, the Taco Bell employee allegedly asked her what she wanted and promised to give her the food for free. He then proceeded to make her order as well as a few extra goodies — including what appeared to be a large Baja Blast.  This week's Getting Rich episode, sponsored by Acura, offers tried and tested tips for saving up for that car, house payment, or dream vacation The move clearly made Elizibeth emotional. She ended her clip by thanking the employee — who she said works at a Taco Bell in Temple Terrace, Florida — calling his act of kindness “the first step in my healing process.” “I love you so much,” she says at the end of her clip. TikTok users were equally emotional after hearing about the situation. Many poured into the comments to praise the employee.  “It’s the little things,” one user wrote.  “Taco Bell, you’re hiring the right kind of people,” another commented.  “Taco Bell employees are on another kind of NICE,” another added.  How men can achieve the perfect off-duty style More from In The Know: Can you really deep-fry a fast-food burger? 7 flirty tops perfect for a first date Heading back to the office?

2/3/2022,"Melinda French Gates, co-founder of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, will no longer be pledging the majority of her wealth to the philanthropic organization. According to the Wall Street Journal, French Gates still plans to distribute much of her fortune across philanthropic endeavors, but largely outside of the Gates Foundation, which is one of the world’s largest. “I recognize the absurdity of so much wealth being concentrated in the hands of one person, and I believe the only responsible thing to do with a fortune this size is to give it away – as thoughtfully and impactfully as possible,” French Gates wrote in a new letter. “The ultimate goal of any philanthropist should be to render the need for philanthropy obsolete,” the billionaire wrote. “It’s important to acknowledge that giving away money your family will never need is not an especially noble act. There’s no question in my mind that the real standard for generosity is set by the people who give even when it means going without. “That’s why, as part of this pledge, I commit to doing more than writing checks. I also commit my time, energy, and efforts to the work of fighting poverty and advancing equality – for women and girls and other marginalized groups – in the United States and around the world.” In 2010, French Gates and her then husband Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, launched The Giving Pledge, alongside billionaire investor Warren Buffett. The campaign encourages the world’s richest people to dedicate the majority of their wealth to charitable causes. At the time, the former couple revealed in a joint letter that they have “committed the vast majority of our assets” to the Gates Foundation in efforts to address preventable death from various diseases and “tear down other barriers to health and education”. However, since their divorce in 2021, French Gates and Gates have each penned individual letters detailing varying philanthropic commitments. In 2015, French Gates founded Pivotal Ventures, an investment and incubation company that seeks to advance social and professional progress for women and families across the US. In French Gates’ letter, she reiterated her commitment to giving away the vast majority of her wealth. “I think philanthropy is most effective when it prioritizes flexibility over ideology – and why in my work at the foundation and Pivotal Ventures I’ll continue to seek out new partners, ideas, and perspectives,” she wrote. In a separate letter published by Gates, the Microsoft co-founder emphasized his philanthropic commitments to the Gates Foundation: “The foundation is my top philanthropic priority, even as my giving in other areas has grown over the years.”",World/The Guardian,Melinda French Gates to no longer give bulk of wealth to Gates Foundation,https://news.yahoo.com/melinda-french-gates-no-longer-152233040.html
2/3/2022,"Riot defendant Richard Barnett said he won't shave his beard until others are pardoned. He seemed driven by Trump saying at a rally that he'd consider pardons for rioters if re-elected. Barnett became notorious when he was pictured lounging with his feet up in Nancy Pelosi's office. A man who was pictured with his feet up on a desk in Nancy Pelosi's office during the Capitol riot said he will grow his beard out until all those who participated in the riot are freed.  Richard ""Bigo"" Barnett, who is accused of joining the riot on January 6, posted a selfie of his beard in a tweet ahead of a court hearing on Tuesday. ""I have a court hearing this morning,"" he wrote. ""Court artist will get to sketch the new growth of my beautiful goatee. I started it in prison and will continue to grow it until all my fellow #J6politicalprisoners are free.""  —Richard Bigo Barnett (@BigoBarnett) February 1, 2022 The tweet came after former President Donald Trump said Saturday that he would consider pardoning January 6 rioters if re-elected in 2024. Riot defendants often refer to themselves as political prisoners. Barnett's tweet also echoed Trump's statement last September that his ""heart is with those standing for rioters,"" and describing them as ""persecuted."" Barnett leapt into the public consciousness after January 6 when a press photo of him lounging in the House Speaker's office amid the chaos was published widely.  The image — in which his beard is closely-cropped — gained him such notoriety that in June last year he began auctioning off signed copies of the photo.  FBI investigators cited the images in their complaint accusing him of entering restricted grounds with a weapon, violent entry and disorderly conduct, and theft. He pleads not guilty on all counts.  Barnett — a self-described white nationalist — has remained unrepentant throughout his trial process. During a court hearing last year, he yelled ""it's not fair!"" at the news of his pre-trial detention, as The Daily Beast's Pilar Menendez reported at the time.  Read the original article on Business Insider",Politics/INSIDER,Man who posed with feet on desk in Pelosi's office vowed not to shave his beard until all Capitol rioters are free,https://news.yahoo.com/man-posed-feet-desk-pelosis-150038623.html
