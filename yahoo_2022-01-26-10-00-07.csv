1/26/2022,"Now that the Lucid Air is a practical reality, there's a looming question: how well does it fare in a drag race against the other well-known electric luxury sedan, Tesla's Model S Plaid? You now have a better idea. DragTimes has shared a long-teased video of a quarter-mile faceoff between the Air and Model S Plaid, and the outcome is at once expected but still full of insights. It won't shock you to hear the Model S Plaid wins three of the four runs, including one with a rolling start. It has a shorter claimed 0-60MPH time (1.99 seconds versus 2.5), and its lighter curb weight (4,828lbs versus about 5,200lbs), helps offset the horsepower deficiency. The Tesla didn't have its drag strip prep mode enabled, either. If you're fortunate enough to cross-shop these EVs, the Model S is still your pick for raw acceleration. The Lucid Air still holds up well, though, and it even won a race when the Model S Plaid's launch mode wasn't engaged. That added power still matters, to put it another way — and this is worth considering if you're more interested in green light races (where a launch mode likely won't be an option) than drag strips. Lucid also pointed out that you can precondition the Air for better straight-line performance, and that it's currently focused more on ""luxury and efficiency"" than speed. The conditions weren't ideal between relatively chilly temperatures for the Houston-area strip and strong winds. You'll likely see faster times elsewhere. Even so, the video is worthwhile as a rare chance to see how different electric car platforms manage in real conditions. It also shows just how far EVs have come — these are figures you'd have previously associated with higher-end supercars, not four-door people carriers.",Business/Engadget,Watch a drag race between Tesla's Model S Plaid and the Lucid Air,https://news.yahoo.com/tesla-model-s-plaid-lucid-air-drag-race-195013476.html
1/26/2022,"Shortly before dying of Covid-19, a father in Los Angeles texted family members to express his regret over not getting vaccinated. Christian Cabrera, 40, tested positive for the coronavirus around Christmas. Not long afterward, he was in an emergency room with pneumonia in both lungs. “I can’t breathe again,” he texted his brother, according to KTLA. “I really regret not getting my vaccine. If I can do it all over again I would do it in a heartbeat to save my life. I’m fighting for my life here and I wish I [had] gotten vaccinated.” On 22 January, Mr Cabrera died. His family shared the tragic news on a GoFundMe raising money for his three-year-old son, Noel. “We are very sad to announce that our beloved brother Christian Cabrera … has lost his battle with Covid pneumonia and passed away tonight,” Mr Cabrera’s brother, Jino Cabrera, wrote in the fundraiser. “He touched so many people’s lives because he was a very loving, kind, generous, caring person with a beautiful heart and soul.” Even before Mr Cabrera’s death, his brother said, he worried he might not survive. “He keeps saying, ‘Please take care of my son,’” Jino told KTLA last Thursday. “He knows he might not make it. He might die in there.” Covid cases in Los Angles are currently dropping from their Omicron-era peak, but they’re still extremely high. As of 24 January, the city was facing an average of almost 33,000 new infections per day. And on 20 January, just two days before Mr Cabrera died, LA County reported 102 deaths from the virus in a single day – the highest number in a year. As in the rest of the country, the worst outcomes have been among the unvaccinated. According to LA’s Department of Public Health, unvaccinated LA residents have been six times more likely to end up in an ICU than someone fully vaccinated, and 25 times more likely than a fully vaccinated person who’d also received a booster. “Our hearts go out to everyone mourning the loss of a loved one as we are once more witnessing the utter misery caused by COVID,” Dr Barbara Ferrer, the city’s public health director, said last week. “Let’s not fool ourselves by not recognizing the danger presented by the Omicron variant, which is capable of spreading with lightning speed and causing serious illness among our most vulnerable residents.”",U.S./The Independent,Father dying of Covid regrets not getting vaccine in heartbreaking texts,https://news.yahoo.com/father-dying-covid-regrets-not-230143683.html
1/26/2022,"Rudy Giuliani's lawyers said in a court filing that he can't give Dominion documents for its lawsuit against him. They said the FBI took them all when they raided his home and office last year and he didn't keep backups. Dominion alleges Giuliani defamed the company with 2020 election conspiracy theories. Rudy Giuliani can't hand over documents for Dominion Voting System's $1.3 billion lawsuit against him because they're in the possession of the FBI. The revelation came in a new filing for a sprawling legal case where Dominion has sued Giuliani, fellow pro-Trump lawyer Sidney Powell, and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell over an array of false conspiracy theories that the election technology company manipulated the results of the 2020 election. In a joint letter proposing a schedule to move those cases forward, Dominion's attorneys wrote that Giuliani can't provide discovery material for the lawsuit against him because the FBI seized them when they raided his home in May as part of an investigation into whether he broke lobbying laws. Giuliani didn't make any backup copies, his lawyers say. ""Giuliani claims that he has no access to any electronic documents, files, or communications, including back-up files or files stored in the Cloud, from before April 2021 because those files have all been seized by the FBI, and Giuliani failed to maintain copies of any of them,"" Dominion's attorneys wrote. In the same filing, Giuliani's lawyers corroborated that the FBI was in possession of his files. ""Giuliani's position is that given that the FBI did not offer Giuliani the opportunity to make back-up copies of the electronic devices and/or cloud data it took possession of, Giuliani objects to Plaintiffs' suggestion that he 'failed' to maintain copies of the documents,"" his attorneys wrote. ""These electronic files/data are no longer under Giuliani's possession, custody, or control."" Dominion said it's seeking documentation surrounding the circumstances of Giuliani's media interviews where he falsely claimed Dominion manipulated election results. Giuliani has said in court filings that his claims were ""substantially true"" and didn't meet the threshold for defamation. In May of last year, federal agents raided Giuliani's home and office in Manhattan as part of its investigation, as well as his associates Victoria Toensing and Joseph diGenova. Prosecutors are reportedly examining whether he broke lobbying laws during a failed quest to find politically damaging information about now-President Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 election. In the intervening months, prosecutors and Giuliani's attorneys have fought over whether some of the material taken by the FBI should be protected by attorney-client privilege. A special master appointed by the court said in a report Friday that three of the tens of thousands of documents should be shielded from prosecutors because of privilege, and dozens of others because they were ""highly personal."" Dominion's lawyers said in Monday night's joint letter that they will ask Giuliani to request copies of the relevant discovery documents from the FBI. While Lindell has been appealing US District Court Judge Carl J. Nichols's decision to allow Dominion's lawsuits to proceed, lawyers for Giuliani and Powell said in Monday night's letter that they expect to win the cases Dominion brought against them in summary judgment. Dominion proposed a schedule that would bring the cases to trial in 2023. Dominion's attorneys also said they did not anticipate settling with Lindell, Giuliani, or Powell. ""Given the devastating harm to Plaintiffs, the lack of remorse shown by Defendants, and the fact that many of them continue to double down on their lies, Plaintiffs do not believe any realistic possibility of settlement exists,"" their lawyers wrote.

1/26/2022,"It does not exactly break your heart to see Mitch McConnell used as a piñata. He is a man of uniquely pious hypocrisy, able to affect moist-eyed sincerity while ruthlessly chopping the legs out from under democracy. Whether it is stealing Supreme Court seats or defending an indefensible president, his superpower is the uncanny ability to lie, to know that you know he’s lying and yet to keep a straight face through it all. So one does not weep to see him smacked about, as happened last week after he rhetorically implied that African Americans are something other than real Americans. But one hopes both ardent critics and casual observers understand that ultimately, this is not simply a McConnell problem — which is to say, not just a transient gaffe reflecting only one senator’s clumsy syntax. For those who missed it, a recap: Asked last week about African-American anxiety over the Senate’s failure to pass legislation to expand and defend voting rights, the minority leader replied: “Well, the concern is misplaced, because if you look at the statistics, African-American voters are voting in just as high a percentage as Americans,” Ouch. It was a framing for which he is rightly being pilloried. Black voters have filled Twitter with images of themselves over variations of the message, We Are Americans, with the hashtag #MitchPlease. The NAACP tweeted archly, “Senator McConnell, what is the difference between African Americans and Americans?” On Friday, McConnell pushed back, claiming he meant to say “all Americans” and dubbing the criticism “deeply offensive,” which you’d say, too, if your mouth ratted you out while your brain was off duty. But if you think McConnell is the only one who needs to be reminded that, as Black poet Langston Hughes once put it, “I, too, sing America,” you haven’t been paying attention. You missed Chuck Todd of NBC’s “Meet The Press” describing how “parents” are worried about critical race theory while “parents of color” might have a different view. You also missed CBS News’ tweet asking, “How young is too young to teach kids about race?” As if children of color don’t learn about race about the same time they learn about walking. Finally, you’ve missed all those news stories where reporters talk about “working-class voters,” “suburban moms” or “evangelicals” when they mean “white” — as if Black and brown people did not work, live outside the city or go to church. Granted, this is not the bigotry of torches and hoods. No, this rhetorical decoupling of “African” and “American,” of Black people from normal human functions, represents “only” the bigotry of the implicit assumption, the things some people believe without consciously knowing they do — much less interrogating why they do. And yet, they do. For them, white is the default position, the color of generic American-ness and, truth be told, generic human-ness. By contrast, Black and brown are the colors of exoticism, noteworthy only for how they diverge from, challenge or impinge the perceived norm. That’s what McConnell’s mouth revealed about him. But it is necessary to recognize that he is not an outlier. Nor is inexact language the sin here. Rather, it is language that implicitly disavows, disinherits and disrespects tens of millions of people who are every bit as “American” as Mitch McConnell on his best day. Yes, it’s “only” the bigotry of the implicit assumption. But that’s the most common kind.",U.S./Miami Herald,McConnell’s not alone.

1/26/2022,"Chris Vangellow's four children were complaining of bland lunches and small portions. When Vangellow posted a picture of the school lunch, it went viral. Now he and his son are working to change things. A dietitian says parents should speak up. When Chris Vangellow's four children returned to in-person learning after being remote for much of the COVID-19 pandemic, they noticed something different about school lunches. Now that lunches were free for everyone — a federal policy during the 2021-22 school year — the kids reported that portion sizes were getting smaller and smaller, and the food was becoming less and less appetizing. Vangellow encouraged his kids, ages 13, 14, 15, and 16, to pack snacks from home to supplement school lunch, especially on days they had sports. But he couldn't let go of what they had said. ""It got me wondering how bad it really was,"" he told Insider. On January 12, Vangellow's son sent him a picture of school lunch: four scrawny chicken nuggets, white rice, and a handful of dried-looking carrots. Vangellow couldn't keep quiet, so he posted the picture to his Facebook, and it quickly went viral. ""This was never about my own children not being fed properly by the school. This is about all of the kids,"" Vangellow said. Many kids in his New York town are from low-income households and rely on school meals for the bulk of their nutrition. What's being offered now isn't enough to get kids through the school day, let alone sports practices and extracurriculars, Vangellow said. Elysia Cartlidge, a registered dietitian and owner of Haute and Healthy Living, said that having well-balanced, nutritious meals is critical to kids' health and success in school. ""Children are growing and developing and therefore require sufficient energy and nutrients in order to fuel their bodies and brains,"" she said. Technically, the lunch that Vangellow posted a picture of meets regulatory requirements because it has a protein, grain, vegetable, and dairy. In practice, it's a different story. ""I don't think most adults would want to eat that lunch, let alone children,"" she said. In order to establish healthy eating patterns that last a lifetime, kids need appetizing healthy food. Ideally, a school lunch will be vibrant, tasty, and colorful, with at least three food groups, Cartlidge said. Although research has shown that the nutritional quality of school lunches has improved over the past 10 years, recent changes by the US Department of Agriculture have allowed schools to serve meals that have more sodium and less nutritional value, Cartlidge said. After Vangellow's post, the school district issued a response saying that students are ""allowed one more serving of fruits or vegetables and one additional nugget than appeared in the photograph."" But the district also acknowledged that clearly Vangellow's message resonated, and parents and students were not satisfied with school-meal options. The district has decided to convene a panel of parents, students, and others to come up with solutions for making school lunches more appealing and appetizing. Vangellow and his son both plan to serve on it. In addition, Vangellow's kids have already noticed changes to meals. ""Our kids, as well as friends' kids, have remarked that in the last few days things have already improved,"" Vangellow said. ""That makes me think that someone was dropping the ball somewhere, and the attention that this has gained has helped correct those actions."" Cartlidge recommends that parents check in with their kids and educate themselves on what's being served at the schools near them. If you think your local school system could do better, she suggests using the resources from the Chef Ann Foundation for organizing locally and advocating better food options in schools. Vangellow said this experience has shown him that speaking up really can make a difference. ""A single post from one person has some great potential to really stir things up sometimes,"" he said.

1/26/2022,"An Iowa-licensed physician who has questioned the use of vaccines and face masks in fighting COVID-19 says that each day she treats up to 40 patients from around the country and is staging “jailbreaks” that involve pulling patients out of hospitals against the medical advice of other doctors. Dr. Mollie James, who operates a clinic in Chariton, is a surgeon and critical care specialist who trained at Mercy Medical Center in Des Moines and the University of Minnesota. She has practiced in Des Moines, St. Louis and New York City. Her license is in good standing with the Iowa Board of Medicine. Much of what James says about COVID-19 contradicts the federal government’s advice on mitigation and treatment, a fact she readily acknowledges. She recently appeared on “The Tamara Scott Show,” a call-in talk show aired by Lindell TV, a video channel created by Mike Lindell, the My Pillow founder who has been active in spreading discredited claims of voting fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Scott is the Republican National Committeewoman for Iowa and has worked as a Statehouse lobbyist for Concerned Women for America and The Family Leader. In her Jan. 18 appearance on Scott’s program, James said she and a team of other health care professionals have arranged what she calls “jailbreaks” to get COVID-19 patients out of the hospital even if they’re still using bottled oxygen to help them breathe. “What we do is we make recommendations to the family and we get them ready to pull the patients out, against the medical advice of the hospital, when they hit 10 liters (of supplied oxygen),” she said. “We’re confident enough in our treatment protocol that we know those oxygen requirements will drop fairly quickly once we get them in the home environment.” She said she recently coordinated with the family of one special-needs adult to get him out of the hospital and the man was at home and off oxygen the next day. Another man was removed from the hospital about a week ago, she said, and is now “almost off of oxygen and he is sitting up eating eggs and bacon and playing with his grandkids. He’s totally fine.” During the program, James and Scott also discussed James’ use of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine in treating COVID-19 for patients around the country. The FDA has not approved ivermectin for treating COVID-19 and says currently available data suggests it may pose a risk to some patients. As for hydroxychloroquine, the FDA says the drug has not been proven to be safe or effective in treating COVID-19 and might cause abnormal heart rhythms in some patients. “We hear the U.S. Postal Service has told their agency to stop packages coming from India that might have ivermectin,” Scott said. “So, is there any way that Americans can still get that?” “I don’t have any problem,” James replied. “My clinic has a network of pharmacies across the country that will fill (prescriptions). I can get it to anyone within three to five days. So, we definitely recommend our patients do a preventative consult and see us before they need it so that we can get the meds and they can have them in their cabinet.” “Expect a call from me after the show,” Scott said. More: Latest COVID surge brings another surge of COVID coverage James also described for Scott how she uses ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine on patients in the early stages of infection. “At the onset of symptoms, we can treat with things like hydroxychloroquine, that direct suppresses viral replication, we treat with ivermectin, that blocks the virus’ ability to get into the cells and replicate,” she said. A Minnesota woman called in and asked whether “we should be having ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine in our medicine cabinet before we get sick.” “Yes, you should,” James responded. “Can they contact JamesClinic.com and set up a pre-interview?” Scott asked. “They can certainly call us,” James replied. “We have actually been so busy taking care of sick patients we are doing our prevention consults as a group consult. So, basically what it is, you sign up ahead of time, we do an hour-long Zoom, and we review everything you need to know to take care of yourself. And then a doctor will review your medical history and send your prescriptions in. ” On James’ website, prospective patients can sign up for consultations by clicking on links that say, “I am sick with COVID-19 and can’t breathe: $790,” or, “I want to prevent COVID-19: $290.” James told Scott that other doctors who take her approach to treating COVID-19 are being “targeted” by the medical establishment. She told James that after the pandemic hit, she ran into problems with the hospitals that employed her due to her own views on the matter. “I left the hospitals,” she said. “One by one, my privileges were removed, or I was suspended or terminated, because I didn’t get the vaccine. I didn’t need it. I had natural immunity having been sick from one of the patients.” More: Iowa nursing homes wrestle with a COVID resurgence that is less severe but still dangerous During the interview, Scott discussed the federal government’s efforts to have all health care professionals in Iowa’s Medicaid-funded facilities vaccinated “even though the governor said we wouldn’t do it.” James said those Iowa professionals need to “unite and fight” the federal requirement. “What they’re doing is eliminating all critical thinkers from the hospitals, from the police force and from the military,” she said. “And so what you are going to be left with is people who just follow the rules or follow policy.” On Jan. 11, James was a guest on the podcast of conservative Iowa commentator Steve Deace, who said he’s a patient of James and that he has referred friends and family to her clinic. James told Deace that since September when she resumed her practice in Iowa, she has treated about 3,500 patients, which suggests an average of 30 patients per workday. Not all of them were COVID-diagnosed, she said, but they had symptoms. She said one of those patients died, and 30 to 40 required subsequent hospitalization. Most of her patients are in their 50s, she said. James also told Deace her telemedicine team includes two full-time physicians, one full-time nurse practitioner and one part-time nurse practitioner who see patients. In one day, she said, her team “saw 30 to 40 sick patients.” James’ views on COVID-19 – as well her public statements on gun rights, critical race theory and immigration – have endeared her to conservative media outlets. With regard to ivermectin, the so-called horse de-wormer, she has said, “There’s no medicine that’s safer on the planet,” adding that she prescribes it for her patients while other doctors refuse for fear of losing their license. Kent Nebel, executive director of the Iowa Board of Medicine, told the Iowa Capital Dispatch last month that the licensing board can’t comment on James specifically, but is currently looking at complaints involving Iowa doctors who are spreading questionable information about COVID-19. The board respects the free-speech rights of physicians, he said, but it’s also aware that spreading misinformation impacts the public health and may intersect with a physician’s treatment of specific patients. James has not responded to messages the Capital Dispatch left with her clinic staff. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has emphasized the safety of COVID-19 vaccines, saying reports of adverse events such as allergic reactions, myocarditis or pericarditis are rare and the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the risks. More: Polk County adds drive-through COVID testing sites as omicron wave spikes demand One of James’ former websites – which bore the domain name IvermectinCan.com — stated that The James Clinic is a membership-based “concierge practice” for Iowans who are “ready to take their health back.” Patients pay a membership fee and in return they are eligible for a multi-tiered array of services. The “Platinum+ Members” are entitled to a personal health concierge, a functional-medicine assessment, extended physician availability, “monthly advanced infusions” of something that’s not specified, and unlimited treatments in the clinic’s new hyperbaric chamber. According to the clinic’s website, treatment fees for COVID-19 range from $290 for those who simply want to prevent the virus, to $990 for those with long-haul symptoms of the virus. Those who are currently sick with the virus pay $490, and those who are sick and having trouble breathing are charged $790. One of James’ posts on Twitter reads, “We are winning! No mandates. No vax for kids … We’re literally killing our kids because the boomers are scared. Pathetic.” Another states, “Where is your red line? In order to work will you let someone swab your nose weekly? Wear a market (sic) that you’re ‘unclean’? Jab you? My rights come from God and require none of this nonsense.” More: Iowa sets one-week record for COVID cases; nearly 1,000 in hospitals Find this story at Iowa Capital Dispatch, which is part of States Newsroom, a network of news bureaus supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.
