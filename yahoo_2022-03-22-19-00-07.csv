3/22/2022,"STORY: Streches of Ukraine's Mariupol are now piles of rubble. Satellite images show thick smoke billowing from blackened apartment buildings after the heaviest bombing since Russia launched its invasion. Late on Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy insisted on meeting Russian leader Vladimir Putin and said it was not possible to negotiate an end to war without meeting him. “I have repeated and offered this for a few years, I think that without this meeting you cannot truly understand what they are prepared to do in order to stop the war and what they are prepared to do if we are not ready for this or that compromise."" Zelenskiy has tried to meet with Putin for a year, but he has refused. Russia calls the war a ""special military operation"" to disarm Ukraine and protect it from what it calls ""Nazis."" Putin says NATO, as an instrument of the United States, was building up its military on Ukraine's territory in a way that threatened Russia. On Monday Zelenskiy also repeated that Ukraine would not now join NATO. Meanwhile, no power, no food, no heating in Mariupol with people struggling to survive in basements. International Red Cross president Francesco Rocca said an aid convoy can't enter the city. ""It's stuck, stuck, no access. They can't go. So from the Ukrainian Red Cross side they are still waiting (for) the green light, but unfortunately so far, and this is the news of this morning, they have no access in the area, which is of course, you know, there are very tough ongoing operations in the city."" Elsewhere in the city grim scenes of the war’s impact – with people digging graves in the middle of the street for their own neighbors. The UN agency for human rights says it has been unable to receive or verify the death toll and casualty numbers from badly hit cities like Mariupol. But officials in Mariupol say around 2,500 people have died since Russia’s invasion. Russia denies targeting civilians.",Politics/Reuters Videos,Ukraine's Zelenskiy insists on meeting with Putin,https://news.yahoo.com/ukraines-zelenskiy-insists-meeting-putin-072008110.html
3/22/2022,"(Reuters) -EU foreign and defence ministers on Monday agreed a security strategy meant to boost the bloc's military clout when war has returned to Europe, establishing a rapid reaction force with up to 5,000 of troops to be swiftly deployed in a crisis. ""The threats are rising and the cost of inaction is clear,"" the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a statement, calling the document that sets out European ambitions in defence and security to be reached by 2030 a ""guide to action"". Work on the strategy started in 2020, before the pandemic, a chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and the Ukraine war. After Russia's invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24, the EU toughened its language on Moscow. ""The EU needs to be able to protect its citizens and to contribute to international peace and security,"" the bloc said in a statement. ""This is all the more important at a time when war has returned to Europe, following the unjustified and unprovoked Russian aggression against Ukraine, as well as of major geopolitical shifts."" Russia has described its invasion as a ""special military operation"" to disarm Ukraine. At the same time, the EU has made it clear it sees its efforts as complementary to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and not intended to compete with the U.S.-led military alliance as an anchor of Western defence. Germany is ready to provide the core of the EU's new rapid reaction force in 2025, the year it is meant to become fully operational, Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht said in Brussels. The force will replace the existing EU battlegroups that the bloc has had since 2007 but never used. Plans for an overhaul gained traction after European countries struggled to handle the chaotic withdrawal from Kabul in August. EU leaders are expected to sign off on the security strategy, referred to as the Strategic Compass, at a summit on Thursday and Friday in Brussels.
