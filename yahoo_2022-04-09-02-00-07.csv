4/9/2022,"For the third time in a week, a visitor to the Florida Keys died while exploring the waters. On Thursday afternoon, 74-year-old Carol Murrell Maillet, of Seattle, died after snorkeling at Dry Tortugas National Park, a remote spot 70 miles west of Key West that can be reached only by boat or seaplane.

 She was snorkeling along a Fort Jefferson wall by the beach when people heard her screaming, according to the Monroe County Sheriff’s Office. Two good Samaritans brought her ashore and began CPR. “There was a family member in the water and other witnesses around,” said Adam Linhardt, spokesman for the sheriff’s office. Murrell Maillet was airlifted by the Trauma Star helicopter to Lower Keys Medical Center in Key West. She was pronounced dead at 2:47 p.m. She was not on a guided snorkel outing. A seaplane trip between Dry Tortugas and Key West can take about 40 minutes, The sheriff’s office is still investigating the death, but foul play is not suspected, Linhardt said Friday. Autopsy reports are pending. Two diving deaths were reported earlier this week: two men— ages 68 and 72 — both in separate incidents off Islamorada.",U.S./Miami Herald,A 74-year-old woman screamed while snorkeling off Key West.

4/9/2022,"InfoWars conspiracy theorist Alex Jones talks a lot about preparing for the apocalypse, selling his fans all manner of ways to stock their bunkers ahead of the end of the world. But now plaintiffs for Sandy Hook families suing Jones allege that he’s “doomsday prepped” his own business ahead of hefty legal judgments, illicitly moving money out of InfoWars into shell companies to avoid paying his victims. In a court motion filed Wednesday in Texas, the families claim that he has concealed InfoWars’ assets to make the company appear to be nearly bankrupt. The families were joined in the motion by another man suing Jones for falsely accusing him of carrying out the 2018 Parkland shooting. The filing was first posted online by Courthouse News. InfoWars didn’t respond to a request for comment. Alex Jones Was Too Sick to Be Deposed by Sandy Hook Families, but Not Too Sick to Host Infowars On paper, InfoWars parent company Free Speech Systems seems to lose money every year. Yet Jones has allegedly transferred significant amounts out of the company—financial transactions that often coincide with legal setbacks Jones has faced in the Sandy Hook cases. After the families sued him in 2018, for example, Jones allegedly started personally withdrawing a total of $18 million from the Free Speech Systems bank account over three years, along with drawing an annual $600,000 salary. Many of the suspicious transfers center on a mysterious company called PQPR, which the plaintiffs claim is controlled by Jones and his family members. Shortly after Jones lost his last appeal to block the defamation cases in Texas, PQPR claimed that Free Speech Systems owed it $54 million—almost all of InfoWars’ assets. Free Speech Systems began transferring its money to PQPR, then onto a series of shell corporations controlled by other Jones family members, according to the motion. While the payments were ostensibly made to pay off the hefty $54 million in arrears—a debt PQPR hadn’t bothered to enforce in the seven years during which InfoWars racked up the tens of millions in supposed debt—the plaintiffs say this was just a scheme to shelter InfoWars assets in an “alphabet soup of shell entities.” “They’re transfers designed to siphon off [Jones’] assets to make them judgment-proof,” the lawyers allege. Alex Jones Could Face Arrest After Defying Court Order—Again The debt payments accelerated after a Texas judge ruled before trial that Jones lost his case, an unusual step taken because of Jones’ repeated violations of other legal rules. Since that ruling, the plaintiffs say Free Speech Systems has paid PQPR between $11,000 each day and $11,000 each week, along with as much as 80 percent of InfoWars’ sales revenue. In their motion, the lawyers for the Sandy Hook families describe the payments as “jaw-dropping.” The discovery of the alleged transfers marks just one in a number of legal headaches facing Jones as the Sandy Hook cases head to trial later this month. He has lost cases in both Texas and Connecticut by default judgment, meaning the upcoming trials will only be used to determine how much he has to pay the plaintiffs. In late March, Jones dodged a deposition in the Connecticut case by claiming he had a surprise illness, only to ultimately sit for the interview after a judge ordered him to pay $25,000 a day until he complied.

4/9/2022,"By Natalia Zinets LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Russia on Thursday appeared to give the most damning assessment so far of its invasion, describing the ""tragedy"" of mounting troop losses and the economic hit as Ukrainians were evacuated from eastern cities before an anticipated major offensive. Moscow's six-week long incursion has seen more than 4 million people flee abroad, killed or injured thousands, left a quarter of the population homeless, turned cities into rubble and led to Russia's near total isolation on the world stage. In a symbolic move, the United Nations General Assembly suspended it from the U.N. Human Rights Council, expressing ""grave concern at the ongoing human rights and humanitarian crisis."" Russia then quit the council. Russia has previously acknowledged its attack has not progressed as quickly as it wanted, but on Thursday Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov lamented the rising death toll. ""We have significant losses of troops,"" he told Sky News. ""It's a huge tragedy for us."" Russia is facing its most difficult economic situation for three decades due to unprecedented Western sanctions, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said earlier. Russia says it launched what it calls a ""special military operation"" on Feb. 24 to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Kyiv and its Western allies reject that as a false pretext. Following new measures announced this week in response to the killing of civilians in the town of Bucha that were widely condemned by the West as war crimes, Ukraine wants allies to stop buying Russian oil and gas amid divisions in Europe over how far to go on energy restrictions. ""Once and for all, we can teach Russia and any other potential aggressors that those who choose war always lose,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the Greek parliament. Moscow has denied targeting civilians and says images of bodies in Bucha were staged to justify more sanctions against Moscow and derail peace negotiations. An EU ban on purchases of Russian coal is set to be pushed back to mid-August following pressure from Germany, two sources told Reuters. And Ukraine accused Hungary of undermining EU unity after Budapest broke ranks with the bloc by saying it was prepared to pay roubles for Russian gas, a Kremlin demand that most in the West had resisted. On the battlefield, Ukraine says following a withdrawal from Kyiv's outskirts, Russia is regrouping to try to gain full control over the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which have been partly held by Russian-backed separatists since 2014. The besieged southern port of Mariupol, where the mayor said over 100,000 people were still trapped, was also a target. ""Evacuate! The chances of saving yourself and your family from Russian death are dwindling every day,"" Luhansk governor Serhiy Gaidai said. Authorities in Dnipro, a city in central-eastern Ukraine, also urged women, children and the elderly to leave. TRADING ACCUSATIONS Both sides continued to trade accusations, with Moscow opening a criminal investigation into allegations by a Russian soldier that he was beaten and received death threats while being held in Ukraine as a prisoner of war. Separately, a social media video verified by Reuters and geolocated to an area west of Kyiv appears to show Ukrainian forces shooting and killing a captured and badly wounded Russian soldier. In the city of Kharkiv, at least one person was killed and 14 wounded in shelling on Thursday, the regional governor said, while Ukraine's prosecutor general reported 26 bodies had been found under two ruined buildings in the town of Borodianka. Reuters could not immediately verify the accounts. NATO members have agreed to strengthen support to Ukraine and the United States is looking into what new weapons it could send as Zelenskiy's government says starving Moscow's war machine is the only way to bring it to a settlement at on-and-off peace talks. On Thursday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Kyiv had presented Moscow with a draft peace deal that contained ""unacceptable"" elements and deviated from previously agreed proposals. Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak told Reuters Lavrov was not directly involved in negotiations and his statements were ""of purely propagandistic significance"" aimed at diverting attention from the killings in Bucha. On Wednesday, Reuters reporters saw the body of a man in Bucha with a rope tied around his feet and a charred hole in his forehead, one of at least five victims shot through the head documented by the news organization. Since Russian troops pulled back last week, Ukrainian officials have said hundreds of civilians have been found dead. Bucha's mayor has said dozens were the victims of extra-judicial killings carried out by Russian troops. Reuters could not independently verify those figures. Media outlets including Reuters have seen satellite images released by a private security company that appear to show bodies in the streets while Bucha was still occupied by Russia, contradicting Moscow's assertion that Ukraine staged the bodies after retaking the town. Accounts by at least a dozen residents of one apartment complex in Bucha painted a picture of violence and intimidation by Russian soldiers. The mutilated bodies of one resident of the complex and another local were discovered in a stairwell.
