1/25/2022,"Vodafone has announced plans to switch off its ageing 3G network next year to focus on using the freed-up spectrum to expand its 4G and 5G networks. Here we explore what impact the move might have.  Launched at the turn of the century, 3G spectrum heralded the start of the transition of the simple mobile phone to the bells-and-whistles smartphones most of the public own today. From video-calling and accessing services such as banking and online shopping to watching Premier League highlights, 3G spectrum ushered in the mobile enabled-era of the wider digital revolution. Mobile operators spent a staggering £22.5bn at the auction of the UK spectrum in 2000, as the promise of billions in new revenues from enhanced usage beyond texts and phone calls fuelled a furious bidding war. The Hutchison-owned Three launched the UK’s first 3G network in 2003. The UK’s 3G networks were state of the art two decades ago, but the technology has been superseded by more powerful and efficient 4G and 5G networks. As most mobile phone users have upgraded to smartphones over the years, 3G is becoming obsolete. Today less than 4% of the data used by Vodafone customers is on its 3G network, and at BT-owned EE it is just 2%, compared with about 30% as recently as 2016. Mobile operators are seeking to retire 3G networks and use the spectrum to bolster 4G and 5G services. BT, which owns mobile brands including EE and Plusnet, has previously said that there are between 2 million and 3 million people using 3G handsets across all UK mobile networks. Many of these are older phone owners who have preferred to stick with simple-to-use devices rather than be enticed by smartphones. Some have kept a 3G-enabled version as a fallback option in case they lose their main phone. In 2017, there was a resurgence in the popularity of simple phones, with Nokia’s 3310 3G selling 13m handsets worldwide and making it the UK’s third most popular phone brand that year. Based on coverage data approximately 2.2% of the UK is only covered by a 3G signal. For the most part this in remote locations such as rural Scotland, parts of North Norfolk, Wales and Cornwall. However, all of these locations still have a basic 2G signal, which enables voice calling but has extremely limited access to internet data, which is not being switched off. However, EE has said it hopes that as coverage of 4G and 5G is rolled out it hopes to be able to switch off 2G networks as soon as 2025.",News/Business,3G mobile: will the UK network switch-off affect you?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/25/3g-mobile-uk-network-vodafone-4g-5g-coverage
1/25/2022,"The Metropolitan police are investigating alleged parties at Downing Street and Whitehall where people may have breached Covid laws, the force’s chief, Cressida Dick, has announced in a major intervention. Here we look at what’s happened and what it could mean.  Speaking at the London Assembly’s police and crime committee on Tuesday, the Met police commissioner said the force was investigating “a number of events” that took place at Downing Street and Whitehall in potential breach of Covid-19 regulations over the past two years. Met officers had looked into several other events in Downing Street and Whitehall, which had been assessed as not reaching the threshold for criminal investigation, Dick said. But she would not say which. In a separate statement, the Met police said: “Where multiple events occurred on a particular date at a location, all the events on that date will initially fall within the remit of the investigation so that the full circumstances can be established. This does not mean that everyone who attended an event will be investigated.” Allegations of lockdown parties in Downing Street emerged in December 2021 and have snowballed since. Dick said it would “not normally be” a proportionate use of the force’s resources to investigate historical allegations of Covid breaches. But she told London Assembly members that investigations were carried out for “the most serious and flagrant type of breach” where there was evidence and three criteria were met. “My three factors were and are: there was evidence that those involved knew, or ought to have known that what they were doing was an offence; where not investigating would significantly undermine the legitimacy of the law; and where there was little ambiguity around the absence of any reasonable defence. “So in those cases, where those criteria were met, the guidelines suggested that we should potentially investigate further and end up giving people tickets.” She said specialist detectives had continually considered whether a criminal investigation into any of the Downing Street and Whitehall events was proportionate based on the available information. In recent days, she said, the Cabinet Office had provided outline findings from its inquiry to the Met. This is a reference to the inquiry being led by the senior civil servant Sue Gray. The pivotal inquiry by Gray was expected to be published late this week. But publication will now be delayed until the Met has concluded its investigation, according to sources, which could take weeks. No timeline has been given. Many MPs were awaiting the results of the Gray inquiry before deciding whether to submit letters of no confidence in the prime minister. Very. The investigation raises the prospect of sanctions for Johnson and his staff if regulations are found to have been breached. Dick raised the prospect of fixed penalty notices being issued for some, but not all, of those attending, depending on the conclusions of the investigation. The launch of a criminal inquiry and delay of the Gray report could create breathing space for Boris Johnson. Some commentators are already arguing the moves will be a form of reprieve for the prime minister, with interest and fury waning by the time the findings are published. But it could also spur MPs to submit their letters now. A total of 54 letters would trigger a no-confidence vote, and the prime minister would be forced to resign if 180 or more MPs vote against him in a secret ballot.",News/Politics,What does police inquiry into alleged parties mean for Boris Johnson?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/25/what-does-police-inquiry-into-alleged-parties-mean-for-boris-johnson
1/25/2022,"Productivity can be an elusive goal for all professionals, but for small business owners, there never seem to be enough minutes in the day. Whether it’s running reports, answering customer emails, pitching for new business, or dealing with admin, many entrepreneurs are left frustrated that they’re not making enough meaningful progress despite tackling tasks all-day-long. We asked four experts for their top tips on how “Soho” (small office/home office) business owners can boost productivity. Have a routineBusiness coach and growth specialist Kevin Riley finds that building structure into the working day helps keep entrepreneurs on track. “Humans are creatures of habit and the better our routine, the more productive we are,” he says. “I commute to work, even when I’m working from home, taking a 30-minute walk before my day starts and after logging off in the evening.”  Riley also advocates setting 30 minutes aside at the end of the day to tie off loose ends and plan for tomorrow. “That means when I walk into the office at 8 or 9am, I’m ready to go. I’m not thinking, where do I start?” Outsource where you canEven solo entrepreneurs shouldn’t try to do everything themselves, says John McLachlan, organisational psychologist and co-author of Time Mastery: Banish Time Management Forever. “One of the things I spend a lot of time doing with entrepreneurs is encouraging them to do less and think more. Focus on what you’re good at, the skills that have made you successful and spend more time doing that.” Other tasks can be delegated to employees or outsourced to specialists such as accountants, virtual PAs, designers and digital marketing experts, he adds. Build focus like a muscleExperts believe the past two years of pandemic-related uncertainty and stress have had an impact on our attention spans, memory and ability to problem-solve or be creative. The good news is, it’s reversible. Riley aims to build the entrepreneurs he works with up to a 50-minute block of focused work, without any distractions such as emails or social media. Time-management techniques such as the Pomodoro method – which breaks work time into 25-minute intervals, separated by short breaks – or apps that lock social media for 30 minutes at one go can help entrepreneurs break bad habits. Riley also recommends tracking the working week to see where time can be spared, such as scheduling meetings back to back, rather than with short breaks in between (when it’s difficult to get anything meaningful done). “If you work a 40-hour week and can free up 10 minutes a day, that equates to one working week a year,” he adds. Prioritise ‘deep work’A concept first explored by the US author Cal Newport, “deep work” is the ability to focus without distraction, to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time. Alicia Navarro was so inspired by Newport’s theory, she founded the virtual co-working platform Flown to help professionals tap into more focused working. She’s found multitasking business owners particularly receptive to the idea. “Entrepreneurs often live in a very reactive state because there are all these emails to answer and meetings in our diaries, and we try to do deep work in the pockets of time between everything else. That doesn’t work because it takes 25 minutes to get back into a deep work state after you’ve been interrupted,” says Navarro. Instead, schedule two-hour chunks of focused time throughout the week and let “shallow work’’ such as answering emails, chasing invoices or other administrative tasks fit around that. Create accountabilityOne of the challenges for solo entrepreneurs, Navarro says, is the lack of accountability when you work alone. “One of the ingredients for deep work practice is the ritual of accountability,” she says. “At Flown, we set goals for that day’s session in small groups, then work together for two hours silently, before going back to our small group to share how much we’ve achieved.” This idea can also be replicated with a supportive group of other business owners, says neurophysiologist and sleep and energy expert Nerina Ramlakhan: “Surround yourself with people who can inspire you in those moments when you lack confidence. And ask yourself: ‘Why am I doing this? Why is this important to me?’ We’re more likely to be productive if we’re able to connect the task with our value system.” Take a breakIt might sound counter-intuitive, but resting during the work day is one of the most effective things business owners can do when it comes to optimising productivity. “The ultradian rhythm occurs several times a day, roughly every 90 to 120 minutes and determines the limits of our ability to concentrate,” explains Ramlakhan. Many entrepreneurs are perfectionists and find it hard to switch off, but taking a five-minute break to “eat, move, breathe, or reconnect with nature” each cycle will help to prevent burnout. Even a change of scenery can help boost intuitive thinking – you might work from a cafe for the afternoon, for example, instead of at home. Boost your bandwidthGet your technology right and you can get more done. Speedy broadband, ample data allowance, and reliable infrastructure are key components for a productive office, no matter how small. “One of the biggest frustrations in any workplace is technology,” says Riley. “Making sure connectivity is right is crucial. It’s also a good idea to have someone you can call on (such as a freelance IT support service) if you have any technology issues. People waste so much time Googling how to fix something. Every time you do that, you’re losing money.” Plan for the futureMany people wear busyness like a badge of honour, but productivity has to be for a purpose, rather than for its own sake. “If you’re too busy doing tactical day-to-day tasks, you’ll miss the strategic vision,” says McLachlan. “That’s hard in a culture of busyness, because people are frightened to have time to sit and think, because they’ll feel guilty.” Smooth out the peaks and troughs of busy work by building a consistent pipeline of business in advance, he adds. “Otherwise you’re under such high pressure that your performance drops.” Keen to boost your business productivity? You need a connectivity package that gives you the bandwidth to do what you do best.

1/25/2022,"Whether it’s balancing the books, designing the next product release, or pitching for finance, entrepreneurs have to be all things to their business at all times. But what happens if they’re at the helm of more than one company? We spoke to three successful multi-business owners about the highs and the lows of bringing multiple visions to fruition and their advice on making the juggle work.  ‘I’m like a farmer laying seeds’After a steady career in marketing and advertising, Chuong Van Dang didn’t expect to start his own business. But while in Malaysia, he had an idea for a social media platform for scuba divers. “We crowdsourced dive logs and reviewed hotels, and we basically thought we would eventually sell it to TripAdvisor,” he says. Although it grew to 10,000 users in 100 countries, Dive Share eventually wound down without making its millions. But it was an experience that marked a turning point for Van Dang. Now based in the UK, he runs a cleaning company for Airbnb with a team of 14, a dim sum and cocktails meal kit business called Yum Seng, and works part-time for the space tech company Magdrive as a marketing consultant. “When it comes to running multiple businesses, it’s important you don’t have all the businesses at the same stage – you can’t have two in startup mode, for example,” Van Dang says. In his case, four operations staff manage the day-to-day running of the Airbnb cleaning business, while he focuses more on Yum Seng, which he founded during lockdown with his wife, Stephanie. They’ve just expanded to deliver nationwide after focusing on south-east London for the first year. “It meant much larger premises, larger warehousing and a much larger commitment,” he says. The team of five has moved into a nearby shared office space with on-site storage, high-speed broadband and lots of creative minds to collaborate with. Technology has also helped him keep everything going in other ways. “I use a lot of Teams, Slack and WhatsApp. I find those are the quickest, simplest ways to communicate. Email isn’t quick enough!” Ten years after starting his first business, he can’t see himself doing anything else. “You never switch off, so not burning out is the biggest challenge. But it’s also about finding the right business partner to work with and trying not to overstretch yourself. I’m like a farmer laying seeds, waiting to see which opportunity really takes off.” ‘I’m better at keeping things in perspective now’Being diagnosed with cancer in 2019 forced Natasha Ascott to take a step back from running her award-winning children’s outerwear company Muddy Puddles. After months of treatment and being told that she was in remission, Ascott somewhat surprisingly decided to start a second business. “The team did a brilliant job of running Muddy Puddles without me and I had the space and opportunity to decide whether I wanted to jump back in with two feet or do something else after six years of growing the company,” she explains. “I now work with them part-time.” The first Muddy Nursery opened in Buckinghamshire six months ago, with a second due to join the chain in early 2022. Ascott started her career as a teacher and says the diversification aligns well with her passion for education and a customer base she knows well – Muddy Puddles sells to 30,000 families and 300 schools and nurseries every year. But she admits launching a new business hasn’t been easier the second time around. “Some of the biggest challenges include making sure I give the right focus to the right things across both businesses. I try to use the urgent/important matrix to help me prioritise, but can definitely get lost in the weeds. It’s also challenging to communicate and connect well across two different cultures and teams.” Her advice to other entrepreneurs is to get comfortable with juggling. “With two businesses, you’ve got even more hats you need to wear,” she says. Good connectivity is essential too. “I work between a lot of different places and I’m totally dependent on everything being synced up wherever I am. One of the first jobs we prioritised at the nursery was getting everything on to the cloud and making sure everyone could communicate remotely and on-site.” Despite the challenges, she likes the mix of having a product-based and a service-based business and says she feels more resilient this time around. “My dad’s an entrepreneur too and he always says to me: ‘Nothing’s ever as good or as bad as it seems.’ I think I’m better at keeping things in perspective now.” ‘We walk the walk as well as talk the talk’If you’d told Simon Forster he’d be working with some of the biggest names in fast-moving consumer goods with the design agency he co-founded from his dining room table 12 years ago, he wouldn’t have believed you. “I think my dream at the time was to earn a living and convert my garage into a studio,” he says. Now, he employs a team of 20 at Robot Food and has upgraded his studio to an office in Leeds city centre. Working closely with consumer brands gave Forster the inspiration to start one of his own. Stories & Ink is a skincare brand for tattooed skin, and was stocked by major retailers before pivoting to a direct-to-consumer model. The range has generated £250,000 in sales over the past year and is due to be launched in the US shortly. Forster admits the biggest challenge with running multiple companies has been embracing delegation. “I was involved in everything, and you simply can’t be when your business scales and you have multiple interests,” he says. “You have to find people who are better than you and empower them to succeed. Now, I’m the hype guy, the numbers guy, I set the vision and tone.” He’s been able to do that more efficiently than ever before over the past two years, thanks to embracing flexibility and bolstering connectivity throughout the company. Robot Food projects have been organised via Google Chat rooms, workflows have been redesigned to facilitate remote collaboration, and the team has been given more autonomy to choose when and where they work. “Nine to five in the office doesn’t suit everyone,” Forster says. Moving Stories & Ink away from retail and towards e-commerce has opened up new opportunities, while a new Stories & Ink tattoo studio in Falmouth is giving local talent a platform. Despite straddling very different businesses, Forster says running two companies has its benefits. “Stories & Ink is the perfect case study for Robot Food, because brands come to us knowing that we’re walking the walk, as well as talking the talk,” he says.

1/25/2022,"Makis Papadimitriou is the actor who gave a great performance in what deserves to be a modern Greek movie classic: Suntan, in which he played a depressed vacation-resort doctor who conceives a Death-In-Venice obsession with one of the beautiful young sunseekers. So it’s good to see him again, but this is a very tiresome and pointless shaggy-dog-story-slash-road-movie that offers no compelling reason for its own existence, and certainly no interesting or satisfying ending. Papadimitriou is Antonis, a middle-aged loser who finds himself single with a Hornbyesque vinyl collection and a sideline in singing with an embarrassing band, along with his mate Christos (Michalis Sarantis). To combat their creeping ennui, our two amigos decide to go on a quest: to track down the (fictional) 90s softcore VHS porn star called Laura Durand with whom they had both become mildly obsessed, because she vanished from the business 20 years ago, becoming the Greta Garbo of Europe’s adult entertainment scene. And so they go on a quest to find Laura, with at one stage a weird Lynchian diversion into black-and-white, and really a lot of zany and quirky encounters, which are written and directed like kids’ TV, and some hallucinatory visions of Laura in which she appears bisected with video scan lines, as in her cheesy erotic movies.  In some ways, this reminded me of the various documentaries about the real-life 70s porn star Mary Millington, whose unhappy life and death created a cultish posthumous fanbase. Well, a factual porn star is one thing. But a fictional one who does not shed any real light on female or male sexuality, and who is not a very interesting character, is something else.  In the Strange Pursuit of Laura Durand is released on 31 January on digital platforms.",Arts/Film,In the Strange Pursuit of Laura Durand review – queasy softcore-fantasy road movie,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/25/in-the-strange-pursuit-of-laura-durand-review-queasy-softcore-fantasy-road-movie
1/25/2022,"Paul McCartney’s original notes for Hey Jude are being sold, digitally at least, by one of John Lennon’s sons. Julian Lennon has announced details of a Beatles memorabilia sale in which outfits, guitars and the song notes will be sold as non-fungible tokens, or NFTs.  Julian Lennon was five when, in 1968, his father left his mother, Cynthia, for Yoko Ono. McCartney went to see Julian at the Lennon family home in Surrey and came up with the tune and germ of the lyrics for Hey Jude in the car. Originally titled Hey Jules, it was meant to comfort young Julian – take a sad song and make it better. “Hey, try and deal with this terrible thing,” McCartney once said. “I knew it was not going to be easy for him. I always feel sorry for kids in divorces … I had the idea [for the song] by the time I got there.” The song was an immediate hit, becoming that year’s top-selling single in the UK and the US. With its infectious four-minute “na, na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, hey Jude” refrain it remains, arguably, the Beatles’ biggest crowd pleaser. The notes show McCartney structuring the song into four distinct sections. It starts with “voice and piano” and ends with ‘LONG SLOW FADE’. Bidding for the notes starts at $30,000 (£22,267), with buyers told: “This NFT is a one of one edition of the physical item and does not include the physical item.” It does, however, come with an “exclusive audio narration” by Julian Lennon. Other objects being sold as NFTs are three Gibson guitars and two John Lennon outfits: the Afghan coat he wore in the film Magical Mystery Tour and at the launch party for the album Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band; and a black cape he wore in the film Help! Julian Lennon hoped the sale would be “a unique way to continue Dad’s legacy.” He told Variety: “I’ve been collecting these personal items for about 30 years, and I was getting a bit fed up with them being locked away in a vault, where I’ve had to keep them because I didn’t want them to get damaged.” Part of the proceeds from the auction, taking place on 7 February, will go to Julian Lennon’s philanthropic White Feather Foundation. The idea of NFTs is that buyers become the owner of a unique digital item, rather than the unique physical item. The global market for them appears to be booming, last month estimated at $22bn (£16.5bn). The most valuable NFT sale of 2021 was The First 5000 Days, a digital collage by Beeple, the name used by the American digital artist Mike Winkelmann, that was auctioned for $69.4m in March.",Arts/Music,Julian Lennon to auction NFT of Paul McCartney’s notes for Hey Jude,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/25/julian-lennon-to-auction-nft-of-paul-mccartneys-notes-for-hey-jude
1/25/2022,"They begin as they plan to continue, with an exquisite, hypnotic late-night meditation. A gently rippling solo on the kora, the west African harp, gives way to collaboration with cello. Then the cello takes over, with the strings first plucked and then bowed, as the kora now eases back to provide accompaniment to the melody. This is the title track from Chamber Music, the debut album from Ballaké Sissoko and Vincent Ségal, released in 2009 at the start of what has proved to be one of the great African-European partnerships. Seated next to each other on stage they may look an unlikely couple, but they have a similar history. Sissoko, who wears a blue robe, is a griot, and master of the 21-stringed kora. Like his celebrated and equally adventurous cousin Toumani Diabaté he has learned the ancient Mandinka styles, the classical music of west Africa, but is keen to experiment. His last solo album Djourou included a collaboration with a French rapper, and a jaunty reworking of Berlioz. Ségal, who wears a dark suit, is a classically trained cellist who became a celebrity in France improvising with a punk-influenced drummer in Bumcello.  Together, they play almost as if by intuition, as kora and cello switch between providing lead and rhythmic backing, constantly changing direction within the same piece. The music is low-key but quietly thrilling, with improvisation that involves virtuoso kora solos, or passages where the cello is strummed like a guitar. Music from their two albums is mixed with tracks from Sissoko’s solo albums, with Ségal switching to castanets as Sissoko launches into his reworking of Asa Branca by the Brazilian accordion player Luiz Gonzaga. For the encore, they are joined by the remarkable British-based South African cellist Abel Selaocoe, who won a deserved standing ovation for his opening solo set, which involved anything from delicate or growled singing worthy of mbaqanga star Mahlathini to a Bach cello suite prelude, with the audience providing drone effects. Joining Sissoko and Ségal for Mako Mady he adds subtle vocals and cello textures – they should record together as a trio.",Arts/Music,Ballaké Sissoko and Vincent Ségal review – a beautiful cross-border conversation,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/25/ballake-sissoko-and-vincent-segal-review-a-beautiful-cross-border-conversation
