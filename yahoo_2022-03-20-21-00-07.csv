3/20/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) -Russian President Vladimir Putin justified the invasion of Ukraine before a packed soccer stadium on Friday but coverage of his speech on state television was unexpectedly interrupted by what the Kremlin said was a technical problem with a server. Speaking on a stage at the centre of Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium, Putin promised to tens of thousands of people waving Russian flags and chanting ""Russia, Russia, Russia"" that all of the Kremlin's aims would be achieved. ""We know what we need to do, how to do it and at what cost. And we will absolutely accomplish all of our plans,"" Putin, 69, told the rally from a stage decked out with slogans such as ""For a world without Nazism"" and ""For our president"". Many of the Russian slogans used at the rally incorporated the ""Z"" symbol that Russian forces have used as a motif in Ukraine. One read ""Za Putina"" - ""for Putin"". Dressed in a turtleneck and coat, Putin said the soldiers fighting in what Russia calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine had demonstrated the unity of Russia. ""Shoulder to shoulder, they help each other, support each other and when needed they shield each other from bullets with their bodies like brothers. Such unity we have not had for a long time,"" Putin said. As he was talking, state television briefly cut away from his speech mid-sentence and showed earlier pre-recorded footage of patriotic songs, but he later appeared back on state television. RIA news agency cited Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying a technical fault on a server was the reason state television had suddenly cut away from Putin. It was not immediately clear why the server issue led to such an abrupt and unusual interruption. THUNDERSTORMS Putin says the operation in Ukraine was necessary because the United States was using the country to threaten Russia and Russia had to defend against the ""genocide"" of Russian-speaking people by Ukraine. Ukraine says it is fighting for its existence and that Putin's claims of genocide are nonsense. The West says claims it wants to rip Russia apart are fiction. Before Putin spoke, Russia's stirring national anthem, with the words ""Russia is our sacred state"" boomed out across the stands of the stadium used in the 2018 Soccer World Cup along with more modern pop hits such as ""Made in the U.S.S.R."". Putin's favourite Russian band, Lyube, sang patriotic songs about war, sacrifice and the honour of those fighting for Russia. Pan-Slavist poetry by Fyodor Tyutchev, whose verses warned Russians that they would always be considered slaves of the Enlightenment by Europeans, was read out. Russia has lost any illusions about ever relying on the West and Moscow will never accept a world order dominated by the United States which is acting like a sheriff seeking to call all the shots in a saloon bar, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. Putin, speaking as U.S. President Joe Biden talked with Chinese President Xi Jinping by telephone about the Ukraine crisis, quoted Russia's 18th century naval commander, Fyodor Ushakov. ""He once said that these thunderstorms will bring Russia glory,"" Putin said. ""That is the way it was then, that is the way it is now and it will always be that way.""

3/20/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) - Russia's lead negotiator in talks with Ukraine said on Friday they were making progress on the topic of demilitarising the country, but not on Moscow's demand to ""denazify"" its neighbour. Twenty-two days after Russia invaded Ukraine, and after a series of talks in person and by video link, Vladimir Medinsky said the two countries were ""halfway there"" on the question of Ukraine adopting neutral status. ""On denazification, the situation is quite strange because our Ukrainian colleagues on the other side of the table consider there are no Nazi formations in Ukraine and this is not an issue in modern Ukraine,"" he said. Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what President Vladimir Putin called a special operation to reduce its southern neighbourâ€™s military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists. Ukraine and the West reject his stated objectives of demilitarising and ""denazifying"" the country as a pretext for a war of choice against a country with a democratically elected Jewish president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Medinsky said Russia would keep raising the matter in the talks, saying Ukraine harboured ""permitted Nazi military formations"" with their own symbolism, training and ideology. ""I think we will definitely return to this question again and again,"" he said. Zelenskiy has said it is Russia that is behaving like the Nazis by visiting destruction on Ukrainian cities in a war that has killed thousands of people and forced millions to flee their homes. ""This is just a pure Nazi behaviour. I can't even qualify this in any different manner,"" he told an American Jewish group last week.
