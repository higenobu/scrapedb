1/19/2022,"England in Australia: anatomy of a shellacking. The reviews are in. The play-by-play reports have been filed by those closest to this sullen and lifeless Ashes tour. Two things stand out. Firstly, the startling mediocrity of so much of the basic management. There is no question, if only in the spirt of making the deckchairs look nice while the prow of the ship slides into the north Atlantic, that heads must roll, even if just in the name of keeping up appearances.  The second thing is the level of blame and misdirection around England’s defeat, a quality that seems in itself deeply instructive. To date, the roster of excuses offered up by players, management and connected parties has included: the umpires, the rain, the heat, the ball, the pitches, inexperience, bad luck, Darren Stevens, injury, tiredness, boozing, skin folds, not enough family time, too much family time, the need to play golf, playing too much golf, the bowling being too fast, the bowling being too accurate, the bowling being too bouncy, each other and, best of all, a Culture Of Excuses. Plus of course Darren Stevens, and Darren Stevens again. It is a quirk of English cricket’s angst-ridden conversation with itself that Stevens’ name was mentioned so often over the first three Tests that he issued a statement asking people to stop bringing him into it. With good reason too. Here’s a funny thing: Australian Test players in county cricket have a WhatsApp group where they talk about the difficulties of playing here. It’s called “Stevosgoingtogetyou”. And he is. Last summer Stevens bowled to Marnus Labuschagne twice and once to Travis Head. He got them out all three times, for 11, 11, and 20. In reality Stevens is one of the good bits of county cricket – supremely skilful, supremely fit, famously encouraging to younger players, with 227 wickets at 18 to his name between ages 40 and 45. To hold him up as an embodiment of a failed culture is nuts. He’s the good bit, a reservoir of skill and knowledge, and the guarantor of a certain standard of localised difficulty. But then the idea that what happens in the county game is all bad, or divorced in any meaningful sense from every other part of English cricket is clearly absurd. This does seem to be the playbook however. Witness the recent comments of the ECB’s eternally slippery chief executive Tom Harrison , who has presided over county cricket for the last seven years, but who seemed startled to discover in the wake of Ashes defeat that there is so much work to be done here, so many problems that only he, Tom Harrison, can possibly solve. More jarring was Joe Root’s comment that “anyone coming into this Test team at the minute is doing it in spite of county cricket, not because of county cricket.” Root’s wider point was more detailed and well-meaning, although there will always be something a little odd in hearing the highest-paid person in English cricket telling every county level coach, player, groundsman administrator, development officer, paying supporter and junior hopeful that the thing they like is trash and it’s basically their fault England have just lost 10 for 56 in Hobart. In Root’s defence it is a well-worn tale. Pitches are poor, rewarding only 40-something bed-blockers. This in turn is not preparation for Test cricket where pitches are good and the bowlers quick (not actually true most of the time). And this is why the England Test team can’t make 300. Is this true? The idea county cricket has consistently been an elite testing ground is definitely overplayed. If young players in the 1980s really were being pounded by a revolving attack of Sylvester Clarke and Clive Rice every week why were England so bad at batting? Similarly the idea the current circuit is peopled solely by aged pie-throwing decadents is exaggerated. In his brief appearances for Yorkshire in the last three years Root has faced Michael Neser, Kyle Abbott, Stuart Broad, James Anderson, Fidel Edwards, Jake Ball, Jade Dernbach, Sam Curran, Peter Siddle, George Garton, Michael Hogan, Nathan Gilchrist and Miguel Cummins, while playing alongside South Africa’s current opening bowler, Duanne Olivier. Does this really sound like the end of days? The other obvious problem with Root’s statement is that batsmen keep coming out of county cricket, starting well at Test level, then steadily getting worse. Ollie Pope averaged 47 after seven Tests against high-quality bowling, then fell through the floor as a centrally contracted England player. Is that somehow county cricket’s fault? The same goes for Dom Sibley, who averaged 47 in nine games in his first full Test year then fell apart under the eyes of England’s elite coaches. Ditto Rory Burns, who has got worse as an England player, and also Zak Crawley, who made a double hundred straight out of county cricket then fell to bits once England got him into the system. There is an aspect of being worked out here. It is common to have an early spike of form. Opposition bowlers find your weakness. You plateau out, then work and push on. Why has that not been happening? Why are England unable to oversee that development? This is surely the role of the elite pathway director, the elite batting coach, the head coach, the managing director. It definitely isn’t anything to do with Darren Stevens. There are two points worth adding. Root’s complaints about not replicating exactly the conditions of Test cricket in advance are the words of a sports person who has been cosseted through a system from boyhood, who feels it is an oversight not to be spoon-fed the perfect prep. How many successful people in the history of sport are given this? How many times had Shiv Thakor, Mohammed Siraj, Rishabh Pant and KL Rahul played red-ball cricket in England before last year? How hard and how desperately have England’s batters been begging the England fast bowlers to help prepare them for Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins? That gap is there to be bridged. That is the test. It can be done. This isn’t to say county cricket is a healthy place. But it isn’t a separate, blameable entity, some toxic netherworld presided over by the hobgoblin king Darren Stevens. It is instead of a piece with everything else in English cricket, subject to the same scarce resources, invisibility, narrow demographic and careless management. Rather than blame, what it really needs is a little care.",Sport/Sport,Not all failings of England’s Test team can be blamed on county cricket | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/18/not-all-failings-of-englands-test-team-can-be-blamed-on-county-cricket
1/19/2022,"Unilever has been warned that buying GlaxoSmithKline’s consumer products arm is likely to substantially swell its debt pile and could trigger a “multi-notch downgrade” to its credit rating. Ratings agency Fitch said Unilever would not be able to keep hold of its current A rating with a stable outlook beyond 2024-2025, andt be cut to BBB, if it were to acquire GSK’s consumer products division or another large business.  Shares in Unilever, which owns brands including Dove soap, Marmite and Ben and Jerry’s ice-cream, have fallen by more than 10% since news broke of the company’s failed £50bn approach for the pharmaceutical firm’s consumer products arm. Fitch calculated that Unilever’s £50bn offer for the GSK division would have seen the company’s net debt reach levels equivalent to 4.5 or 5 times its pre-tax profit after the deal was finalised in 2022. The agency said it considers cutting a company’s rating from A once it debt rises above the threshold of 3.3 times higher than pre-tax earnings. Unilever will need to raise its offer in order to gain GSK’s approval, according to Fitch, meaning an even higher level of debt. However, Fitch said the extent of the downgrade to Unilever’s credit rating would depend on other action taken by the company, including the dividends offered to investors, whether it acquired other firms, and whether it sells off some of its existing business. Unilever’s chief executive, Alan Jope, has pledged to grow the company’s health, beauty and hygiene business and said this would be funded by selling some of its slower-growing operations, such as food brands, rather than relying on taking on more debt. GSK is planning to demerge its consumer healthcare business – which owns brands including Panadol pain relief and Sensodyne toothpaste – by the middle of this year. The spin-off will be chaired by former Tesco boss Sir Dave Lewis, and analysts have said GSK should hold out for a higher offer. Despite its warning, Fitch said it views “GSK’s operations as complimentary to Unilever’s” and added the acquisition would give a boost to Unilever’s current profit margin. According to Fitch’s analysis, the deal would enable Unilever to strengthen its high-growth range of vitamin products and supplements, while also allowing to start selling over-the-counter medicine through GSK’s range of products for pain-relief and dealing with digestive and respiratory problems. Fitch said any deal between the consumer goods firm and GSK “carries high integration risk”, as the Marmite-owner would have to learn how to distribute over-the-counter medicine.",News/Business,Unilever could lose credit rating with purchase of GSK consumer arm,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/18/unilever-could-lose-credit-rating-with-purchase-of-gsk-consumer-arm
1/19/2022,"Ministers have been issued with a stark warning over mandatory Covid vaccines for NHS workers in England, with a leaked document saying growing evidence on the Omicron variant casts doubts over the new law’s “rationality” and “proportionality”. Two jabs will become compulsory for frontline NHS staff from 1 April after MPs voted on the legislation last month.  But the document, drawn up by Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) officials and seen by the Guardian, said the evidence base on which MPs voted “has changed”, creating a higher chance of objections and judicial review. The effectiveness of only two vaccine doses against Omicron, and the lower likelihood of hospitalisations from the milder variant, are cited. More than 70,000 NHS staff – 4.9% – could remain unvaccinated by 1 April, the document says. NHS trusts in England are preparing to start sending dismissal letters from 3 February to any member of staff who has not had their first dose by then. Amid significant pressures on the NHS, last week groups including the Royal College of Nursing urged Sajid Javid, the health secretary, to delay the legislation, known as “vaccination as a condition of deployment” (VCOD2). An earlier VCOD1 rule applied to care workers and came into force on 11 November. Some exemptions are allowed but the move infuriated dozens of Tory MPs, with 61 voting against extending the mandate to NHS staff in December. The document prepared by DHSC officials noted that two vaccine doses provide up to 32% effectiveness against Omicron infection, which wanes to effectively zero 20 weeks later. At the time the policy was developed, two-dose effectiveness against infection with the Delta variant was substantially higher – 65% with Oxford/AstraZeneca and 80% with Pfizer/BioNTech, the DHSC memo said. Booster jabs have since been shown to be highly effective but are not part of the law for NHS workers. The document says: “While Omicron is more transmissible there appears to be a substantially lower risk of hospitalisation and mortality for those vaccinated vs Delta. “The low VE [vaccine effectiveness] against infection (and consequently effect on transmission) plus the lower risk posed by Omicron brings into question both the rationality of the VCOD2 policy and its proportionality and makes the case for vaccination requirement weaker than when minister decided on the policy. “The evidence base on which MPs voted on VCOD2 has now changed and we may see more objections from MPs, increased media interest and higher likelihood of judicial review.” Work is under way with the UK Health Security Agency “to pull together evidence” for Javid to advise on “appropriate next steps” on the policy and “the inclusion of boosters”, the document adds. Some Tory MPs are likely to use the advice to ministers to push for the policy to be dropped. Mark Harper, the chair of the Covid Recovery Group, said: “Forcing NHS and social care staff to get vaccinated or get the sack wasn’t a sensible policy in December, when I and many of my backbench colleagues voted against it. “Now we’ve learned more about both vaccine efficacy against Omicron transmission and its severity, it looks increasingly foolish. “Ministers would be wise to rethink the policy and avoid putting even more pressure on our NHS by sacking tens of thousands of health and social care workers in the next few weeks. When you know something won’t work, it’s right to change course.” Hospital bosses have voiced rising concerns that they may have to close entire units and send patients elsewhere for treatment because the enforced dismissal of unvaccinated staff means they cannot run safely. There is particular concern about maternity units as hospitals are already 2,500 midwives short. Matthew Trainer, the chief executive of Barking, Havering and Redbridge NHS trust in London, said last week that the loss of unvaccinated midwives, coupled with the fact that it already had a 10% vacancy rate among those specialists, “would put us in quite a serious position”. But the DHSC has dismissed any prospect of a delay. A DHSC spokesperson said: “Health and social care workers look after the most vulnerable people in society, who could face serious health consequences if exposed to the virus. Ensuring staff are vaccinated is the right thing to do to protect patients and those in care. The vast majority of NHS staff have had the vaccine which is our best defence against Covid-19.” A senior NHS official said: “Some staff seem to think the government will back down. But when they realise that they won’t then they’ll have to get jabbed or lose their jobs. Some can be redeployed but many won’t be able to.” With the deadline for for first doses just over two weeks away, “it’s a case of who blinks first” between Javid and unvaccinated staff, the source added.",News/Society,Health department warning over vaccine mandate for NHS England staff ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/18/health-department-warning-over-vaccine-mandate-for-nhs-england-staff
1/19/2022,"The sale of a 16th century villa in Rome containing the only ceiling mural ever painted by the Italian master Caravaggio has been rescheduled and the asking price reduced by 20% after an auction on Tuesday failed to attract any bids. Villa Aurora was put on the market for €471m (£393m) amid a bitter inheritance dispute between the three sons of the villa’s last owner, the late Prince Nicolò Boncompagni Ludovisi, and his American-born wife, Princess Rita Boncompagni Ludovisi.  Bidders had to register their offers before midnight on Monday ahead of an online auction on Tuesday afternoon. Beniamino Milioto, a lawyer for the princess, confirmed there were no offers and that the auction had been rescheduled for 7 April with a 20% reduction in price. Villa Aurora, surrounded by high walls close to the Via Veneto in central Rome, is all that remains of a retreat established by Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte in the 16th century. Caravaggio’s Jupiter, Neptune and Pluto mural was commissioned by Del Monte in 1597 to adorn the ceiling of his small alchemy laboratory. The Ludovisis, a noble family with close ties to the papacy, bought the property from Del Monte in 1621. The lion’s share of the asking price is attributed to the Caravaggio, although the villa also contains ceilings frescoed by the baroque painter, Guercino. Any buyer would also have to stump up a further €11m in restoration costs. In the past, Bill Gates is said to have been interested in acquiring the villa. Alessandro Zuccari, a history professor at Sapienza University in Rome who oversaw the valuation of the mural, said: “I’m not surprised there were no bids, in fact I would have been amazed if a buyer had come forward. The price is too high. Let’s see what happens in April, but I doubt anyone will come forward then – what would someone like Bill Gates do with Villa Aurora, especially with all the extra costs?” Since the site is protected by the ministry of culture, once a bid has been agreed at auction the state will have the chance to buy the property at the same price. A petition launched last week urging the government to intervene and stump up the cash was signed by more than 35,000 people.",News/World news,Auction of Roman villa with Caravaggio mural fails to attract any bids,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/18/auction-of-roman-villa-with-caravaggio-mural-fails-to-attract-any-bids
1/19/2022,"Tonga is facing an “unprecedented disaster” from a massive volcanic eruption that covered the nation in ash and 15-metre tsunami waves that destroyed almost all the homes on two small islands, the government has said. Hampered by a communications breakdown caused by the severing of a major undersea cable, authorities had not released an official update since the blast on Saturday, when the Pacific island nation was shaken by what may have been the largest volcanic event in three decades.  Since then, information on the scale of the devastation had mostly come from reconnaissance aircraft. On Tuesday, the office of Tonga’s prime minister released a statement saying it had confirmed the deaths of three people, although the toll could rise. The government has still not managed to make contact with several inhabited islands. Prime Minister Siaosi Sovaleni’s office said every home on Mango island, where about 50 people live, had been destroyed, and only two houses remained on Fonoifua. A statement described the eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha‘apai undersea volcano, 40 miles (65km) north of Tonga’s capital, as an “unprecedented disaster”. A “volcanic mushroom plume” had reached the stratosphere and extended to cover the entirety of Tonga’s roughly 170 islands, where more than 100,000 people live. Sovaleni’s office announced the deaths of a 65-year-old woman on Mango island and a 49-year-old man on Nomuka, in addition to Angela Glover, a British woman living in Tonga whose body was found on Monday. The government said the Tongan navy had deployed with health teams and water, food and tents to outlying islands. Earlier, aerial photos taken by a New Zealand defence force showed Nomuka island blanketed in black and grey ash. Meanwhile, satellite imagery analysed by the UN showed similar scenes in Kolomotu’a, Tongatapu, and Fafaa village, Kolofo’ou. While some buildings remain standing, others appear to have collapsed, and the entire landscape is coated with ash. At Fua’amotu international airport, the runway appears to have been inundated and is partly covered by either ash or dirt. Other satellite images show that flooding came in several blocks from the coastline. Tongans around the world may be forced to wait weeks for regular contact to resume after testing confirmed that the cable connecting the islands to the outside world was cut in at least one place. The New Zealand foreign minister, Nanaia Mahuta, said on Tuesday the ash could cause problems for getting aid into the country via plane. “Images show ashfall on the Nuku’alofa airport runway that must be cleared before a C-130 Hercules flight with humanitarian assistance can land,” she said. The Australian defence force also sent a surveillance plane on Monday, to assess damage to critical infrastructure such as roads, ports and power lines.",News/World news,Tonga says volcanic eruption and tsunami an ‘unprecedented disaster’ ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/18/tonga-volcanic-eruption-tsunami-unprecedented-disaster
1/19/2022,"The Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, has proposed the formation of a large and unprecedented state agency to investigate election crimes – in a state where there is little evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 election or otherwise.  In response, one prominent state prosecutor sought to tie DeSantis to rightwing conspiracy theorists, calling his proposal “a solution in search of a problem … a $6m door prize for a QAnon pep rally”. Nonetheless, DeSantis, who has also proposed his own militia, wants state lawmakers to allocate nearly $6m to fund an Office of Election Crime and Security, which would have 52 staffers, including 45 investigators. There would be a central office in Tallahassee, the state capital, and investigators based throughout Florida. Staffers in an office with a budget of more than $660,000 to acquire motor vehicles would refer election crimes to either the state attorney general or local prosecutors. The proposed office would have more investigators than law enforcement agencies in some of Florida’s biggest cities have to investigate murders, the Tampa Bay Times reported. In his state of the state address last week, DeSantis said: “To ensure that elections are conducted in accordance with the rule of law, I have proposed an election integrity unit whose sole focus will be the enforcement of Florida’s election laws. “This will facilitate the faithful enforcement of election laws and will provide Floridians with the confidence that their vote will count.” The office would be the first of its kind. Election crime investigations, like other crimes, are typically handled by local law enforcement and prosecutors. Federal prosecutors also have jurisdiction over some issues. The Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, a Republican and staunch Trump ally, has a unit dedicated to investigating election crimes and with a $2.2m budget. It has failed to turn up many cases. Still, DeSantis has complained that officials in Florida are not doing enough to look into election crimes. “That’s not their expertise,” he said in November. “They’ve got all these other crimes that they have to deal with. So, by the time it happens, the election is already over. So, it’s not necessary. And some just don’t want to deal with it at all.” Elections experts widely consider Florida to have some of the best-run elections in the US. The state has a considerable early voting period and has long used no-excuse mail-in voting – which Donald Trump used to cast his vote in 2020. Trump lost that presidential election to Joe Biden, but maintains without evidence his defeat was the result of widespread voter fraud. He also maintains a strong grip on the Republican party. At a press conference the day after the 2020 election, DeSantis said: “The way Florida did it, I think, inspires confidence. I think that’s how elections should be run.” But as Republicans have embraced Trump’s lies, DeSantis, widely considered a frontrunner for the 2024 presidential nomination, has come under pressure to review the 2020 results. He has resisted conducting a review but has nonetheless made it harder to vote. Last year, he signed a law that makes it harder to request a mail-in ballot, limits the availability of ballot drop boxes and makes it harder for third parties to register voters. Andrew Warren, the top prosecutor in Hillsborough county, which includes Tampa, told the Guardian the Office of Election Crime and Security proposal was not serious and that there was no widespread election fraud in Florida. His office, he said, had received four referrals for election crimes over the two decades. “This is a solution in search of a problem,” Warren said. “It’s a really expensive one at that. This is a $6m door prize for a QAnon pep rally. “The implication is that there’s so much election fraud that law enforcement needs help investigating it and that state attorneys need help prosecuting it. I’m willing to bet a pretty penny that there’s not one sheriff or police chief or state attorney in the entire state of Florida who’s having that problem.” OECS staffers, the Democrat added, would “sit around and wait for the phone to ring. That’s a lot of time watching Netflix and playing Candy Crush on the taxpayer dollar.” Warren said he was concerned that such an agency could have a chilling effect on people trying to exercise their right to vote. Last week, Democrats in Florida’s congressional delegation wrote to the US attorney general, Merrick Garland, requesting that he investigate efforts to restrict voting access. “Harmful proposals to create new partisan bodies to oversee our voting process are exactly the kind of action that demand oversight as we work to ensure that our voting process is unquestionably trustworthy,” they wrote.",News/US news,DeSantis proposes election crimes agency despite little evidence of voter fraud,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/18/ron-desantis-election-crime-security-agency-florida
1/19/2022,"“She should still be here.” A small homemade sign, doused in candlelight during one of the many vigils for Ashling Murphy, said what was on the minds of thousands who have stood in solidarity across the island of Ireland and beyond in the past few days. The killing of the 23-year-old schoolteacher, out for a run after class in the bright afternoon light, has been described as “random”. As her life was honoured and she was laid to rest near her home town of Tullamore today, one of her cousins offered a hope that the many vigils taking place in Ashling’s memory would “mark the beginning of an end to violence against women”.  An outpouring of grief but also of testimony in the wake of her death is forcing a collective reckoning with violence that is anything but random. Two weeks ago, a young woman in Dublin was assaulted and left with facial injuries. Two men have been charged. This Thursday marks one year since the killing of Urantsetseg Tserendorj, a mother of two and teacher from Mongolia stabbed while walking home from work in Dublin. A teenage boy was charged with her murder. The stretch of canal where Ashling was running that day is named Fiona’s Way, in honour of a young pregnant woman who went missing in 1996. Between 1996 and 2020, at least 236 women died violently in the Republic of Ireland. Their names have been written out and remembered individually in recent days. A majority of these women were killed in their own homes, by a man they knew, by men they loved, men they had children with. How do we protect against that? When schools in Ireland were asked to observe a minute’s silence today, I thought of how a majority are still under Church ownership and how many are segregated by gender. During lockdown I spoke at a number of feminist society events at Irish universities. I listened to young women speak about never receiving education around consent or sex, how some who had been victims of sexual abuse and assault had been shamed by their own teachers. These women are demanding change. The last of Ireland’s Magdalene Laundries only closed in 1996. Last week marked the first anniversary of a government-backed report that claims these religious-run institutions that incarcerated “fallen” women and girls were in fact “refuges”, contradicting survivor testimonies. Some of the same religious orders now run anti-prostitution initiatives, supporting laws that put female sex workers at greater risk of violence. Women shouldn’t have to die for their experiences to be heard. In the 1980s, the schoolgirl Ann Lovett died alone in a grotto while giving birth and the national airwaves were flooded with testimonies of hidden pregnancies and the violence of shame imposed through doctrine and legislation. When Savita Halappanavar died after being denied an abortion in 2012, the breaking of silences that followed eventually forced constitutional change. But how do we tackle the crisis of male violence and misogyny that is so deeply normalised? The Irish government is promising a new “zero-tolerance” strategy to tackle domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. But the justice system that enforces laws is rife with violent misogyny. In the past few years, barring orders have been issued under the Domestic Violence Act 2018 against 21 serving police officers. Ireland’s Garda commissioner has apologised not only for hundreds of ignored domestic violence 999 calls but also for an Irish police officer recording video of a woman being arrested while naked, a woman who died by suicide after that footage was posted online. A sergeant was recorded joking about raping and deporting two women who were under arrest. Decisions made by those in power over the past few decades to cut single mothers’ welfare and close rape crisis centres have put vulnerable women even more at risk. Even as thousands stood against gender-based violence over the past week, a Men’s Rosary group tried to drown out female voices at one vigil, a female journalist received a threat warning against making “anti-men” remarks, a man is reported to have masturbated at an online vigil, and male “patriots” with links to the far right stoked xenophobia over the potential nationality of the killer. Last summer, after speaking at an event on Irish feminism, of all things, I was having a few drinks outside with some women, when two of us needed to pee. We were walking alone along a darkened road, trying to find a secluded spot to squat for lack of public toilets when a white van passed us, a man just beginning to leer out of the window. In the last week, Irish women have shared experiences of near abductions, of assaults on streets, of constant hypervigilance. That time, we suddenly heard another male voice in the van: “Shut up man, you can’t be saying that.” It was that simple. A man calling another man out. “Shut up man”. And he did. In Duck Duck Goose, a play by the Irish writer Caitríona Daly, a young woman describes how passengers on a bus turned a blind eye when an eccentric and sad-looking man who she smiled at began to grope and assault her. “It’s [a] feeling like assault but nobody else is responding to it in that way so it can’t be, can it?” she asks herself. “People don’t like assault, they stop assault, that couldn’t have been assault.” She escapes, walks to work, and appears calm. “So I want to know how you just know?” she asks a young man who is defending a male friend accused of rape on the basis that the woman looked normal afterwards. “How do you feel so confident having seen her after the ‘alleged’? When people don’t even seem to know what assault is when it’s happening there in front of them?” The scene was based on the testimony of a young Irish woman I know. It is just one example of the everyday violence that is normalised by misogyny and ignored – until a woman is killed.

1/19/2022,"For anyone who has been closely following ministerial media rounds this week, the same slightly anomalous-sounding word has cropped up time and again in discussions of Boris Johnson’s alleged lockdown-flouting social activities: “implicitly”. The same word has also been used by Johnson’s official spokesperson and, most crucially, the prime minister himself when apologising in the Commons for attending a drinks event in the No 10 garden on 20 May 2020: “I believed implicitly that this was a work event.”  What’s going on? The understanding is that Downing Street – most likely with legal advice – has imposed strict messaging on how ministers discuss the subject, in the hope Johnson can face the findings of a report into the various parties without it being proved that he lied. Key to this is the somewhat thin and slippery political plank Johnson is attempting to walk along in accepting he went to the 20 May event but that he also did not realise it was a party – he popped into what is also his own private back garden, chatted to colleagues and returned inside. The use of “implicitly” ties into this narrative of a hard-working prime minister used to seeing colleagues regularly meet outside for work in the May sunshine and automatically assuming this post-6pm gathering, even with bring-your-own-booze drinks, must be the same thing. Legal observers like barrister and Covid rules expert Adam Wagner have noted that other elements of Johnson’s apology and other No 10 language have been similarly cautious, such as the idea it “technically” fell within then-guidance, and that he only realised “with retrospect” that the event was a bad idea. Amid speculation that dozens of Tory MPs have lost faith in Johnson, all this linguistic manoeuvring might be too late to keep him in Downing Street, but it could protect him in the event of something else – a future police investigation.",News/Politics,Can Boris Johnson’s linguistic manoeuvring keep him in Downing Street? ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/18/can-boris-johnsons-linguistic-manoeuvring-keep-him-in-downing-street
