2/16/2022,"A sheriff’s department in southern California is encouraging law enforcement officers who oppose vaccine mandates to “take back [their] freedom” and apply for jobs with the department.  The Kern county sheriff’s office released a video last week inviting applications from deputies within Los Angeles county, where officials passed an order that could lead to the termination of thousands of county workers who haven’t received the Covid-19 vaccine or provided a religious or medical exemption. “Drive north, we have a place for you … Kern county is a community that backs the blue,” the minute-long ad says as country singer George Strait sings The Weight of the Badge, a song paying tribute to police. Covid-19 vaccination rates inside the LA sheriff’s department have lagged far below that of the public with just 54% of workers fully vaccinated, despite a vaccination mandate for county employees. Last week the county board of supervisors moved to shift vaccine mandate enforcement power away from LA county Sheriff Alex Villanueva. Villanueva, who has criticized mask orders and said he will not fire workers who refuse the vaccine, said such an act could lead to more than 4,000 unvaccinated deputies losing their jobs. The sheriff’s office in Kern county, a deeply conservative expanse located immediately to the north of Los Angeles, responded with its video the next day. “So take back your freedom, and APPLY today to work at the Kern county sheriff’s office. You deserve a job that welcomes you and your values, with open arms.” The battle over vaccine mandates for law enforcement in southern California highlights the divide over Covid health rules across the state. Vaccination rates continue to lag in more rural and conservative regions of California, where 70% of all residents are vaccinated. Outrage over Covid-19 restrictions led to the ouster of a Republican county supervisor in Shasta county, handing control of the board of supervisors to a militia-supported group. Kern county doesn’t require vaccinations for its workers. Its sheriff, Donny Youngblood, said in a press conference on Friday that he doesn’t know how many of his department’s deputies are vaccinated. Just 52% of Kern county residents are vaccinated, compared to 70% of LA county residents, according to the New York Times. “There’s a substantial number of deputies that already work here that aren’t vaccinated,” he said. “I have no idea [how many] and don’t care,” Youngblood said at the press conference. Though vaccination rates among law enforcement across the state have trailed behind the statewide rate, Youngblood said Kern county specifically wanted to target LA deputies. “The reason we reached out specifically to LA is there will be 4,000 deputy sheriffs if this were to happen that have real families have real children have real bills that could be unemployed because they refuse to take the vaccination.” Youngblood, who falsely claimed the vaccine doesn’t help or stop the spread of Covid, added that his department has 125 deputy positions it is struggling to fill. “Our substations are about half-staffed. And it really boils down to this: when you call 911 and it’s an emergency and you really want a deputy there, are you gonna ask him if he’s vaccinated or not?” Kern county law enforcement has received scrutiny in the past. In 2015, the Guardian found that law enforcement in Kern county killed more people relative to its population than in any other county in the US. Covid-19 was the leading cause of death for law enforcement killed in the line of duty in 2021 across the US, which saw the highest number of line-of-duty officer deaths since 1930. According to a report from the National Law Enforcement Memorial and Museum, preliminary data shows Covid killed 301 of 458 active federal, state, tribal and local law enforcement officers who died last year.",News/US news,‘We have a place for you’: California county recruits unvaccinated deputies,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/15/los-angeles-unvaccinated-officers-fired-kern-county-job-california
2/16/2022,"A distinguished British diplomat took his own life after suffering “extreme stress” while he worked long hours with little time off on the Covid crisis, a coroner has concluded. Richard Morris, the former ambassador to Nepal, feared that he would lose his upcoming post as high commissioner of Fiji if he could not prove his “resilience”, senior coroner Chris Wilkinson said.  After returning from Nepal, Morris, 52, worked on the case of Harry Dunn, the teenage motorcyclist killed in a crash that sparked diplomatic tension between the UK and the US after the suspect, an American citizen, flew home. He then began working 15-hour shifts six or seven days a week for the Foreign Office’s Covid taskforce and suffered from night sweats, worrying that he was going to make a mistake that could land him in prison, the hearing in Winchester heard. Morris, a married father-of-three, vanished from the family home in May 2020 and his body was not found until 31 August in woodland only 2.5 miles away. The coroner said: “The volume of work was intense and we now know Richard was suffering. Richard suffered an element of a breakdown.” Wilkinson said the pandemic “weighed heavily” on Morris. “In essence from the end of January he had very little – if any – downtime. When he did it was interrupted by his thoughts about work and anxieties or interrupted by calls for help. “I fear that he was very much caught in his own thought process, his diligence and his desire that everything was done correctly and desire to not let the team down, whether that was the team, the government or the country. “Resilience was a significant factor for Richard. His view was that he needed to do the best that he could, that his resilience would put his service at risk and his position in Fiji at risk.” Julia Longbottom, Morris’ boss in the Covid taskforce who is now the British ambassador to Japan, told the inquest she believed he was willingly “going the extra mile”. She said: “There wasn’t anything in his behaviour that indicated a significant change in the way he was or the way he was functioning or the way he was acting towards colleagues. “What I noticed was a slightly more extreme or exaggerated Richard than I had worked with previously, who was somewhat prone to double checking things or question whether he was getting things right or how he was doing. “My focus was reassuring him that he was doing a good job and the team were able to do things.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

2/16/2022,"An Athens court has handed two prominent human rights defenders prison sentences, suspended for three years, after finding the pair guilty of “falsely accusing” a Greek Orthodox bishop of racist hate speech. The three-member tribunal sentenced the activists to 12-month jail terms after acquitting the bishop, Seraphim, the Metropolitan of Piraeus, of antisemitic rhetoric.  “Today’s outrageous verdict is representative of the institutionalised antisemitism that exists in Greece,” said Andrea Gilbert, one of the accused who works at the Greek Helsinki Monitor rights group. “We have immediately appealed and will fight it all the way.” Tuesday’s trial had been closely watched by human rights groups. Calling the conviction “alarming”, Amnesty International tweeted: “The ruling poses a direct threat to the right to freedom of expression and has a chilling effect on human rights defenders advocating against racism and hate speech.” Before the hearing, Human Rights Watch had described the charges against the activists as being part of a troubling trend in Greece of the criminal justice system being employed by the state against civil society. The activists, who also include the Greek Helsinki Monitor’s spokesperson, Panayote Dimitras, had brought the complaint against Seraphim in April 2017. In it, they accused the bishop of public incitement to violence and hatred as well as abuse of ecclesiastical office for issuing a statement described by the country’s Central Board of Jewish Communities, KIS, as being replete with “well-known antisemitic stereotypes, conspiracy theories and traditional Jew-hating attitudes”. After a prosecutor dismissed the complaint more than two years later – arguing the statement should be seen in the context of the doctrine of the Christian Orthodox church – the bishop responded by filing his own complaint against the activists for allegedly making false statements against him. A prosecutor referred the case to trial upon formally charging the pair in November. This is not the first time the religious leader has caused an uproar with his statements. In 2015, he attributed new legislation giving same-sex couples expanded civil rights to the “international Zionist monster” controlling the leftist government then in power. Five years earlier, he told a local TV station that Jews had orchestrated the Holocaust and were to blame for Greece’s debilitating debt crisis – comments he subsequently said were his own opinions and not those of the church. Although Athens has recently forged excellent working relations with Israel, antisemitic attitudes are not uncommon in a society where the vandalism of Jewish memorials is also regularly reported. The criminal charges against the activists had been condemned by an array of rights groups before the trial with many highlighting the increasingly difficult circumstances in which NGOs work. “Human rights defenders [in Greece] are consistently targeted for their legitimate work,” said the international secretariat of the World Organisation Against Torture calling the situation for activists in the country critical. “[They] face different types of attacks, including surveillance, judicial harassment, arbitrary arrests, detentions, ill-treatment, entry bans and expulsions.”",News/World news,Activists convicted of ‘falsely accusing’ Greek bishop of hate speech,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/15/activists-convicted-of-falsely-accusing-greek-bishop-of-hate-speech
2/16/2022,"It was a simple photograph, taken late in the evening on 10 March 2001, that came to symbolize Virginia Giuffre’s case against Prince Andrew and eventually led to the astonishing settlement announced on Tuesday.  The one with the duke’s arm around the 17-year-old’s waist, with Ghislaine Maxwell beaming to one side, and the man behind the camera clicking the shutter but hidden by the flash’s reflection in the window being Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced late financier and sex trafficker. That picture – the one that Andrew claimed on BBC’s Newsnight might have been doctored, since he had “no recollection” of then or ever meeting Giuffre at Tramp nightclub in London – will likely serve as both a prequel and postscript of the saga. It has been reproduced in countless newspaper articles about the scandal and is one of the main reasons behind the settlement, which the duke’s lawyers said includes a “substantial donation to Ms Giuffre’s charity in support of victims’ rights”. The picture’s symbolism was not lost on Wendy Murphy, a former sex crimes prosecutor. She said: “If this were not a member of the royal family with a person from a very different social class, the picture would tell you nothing, because it’s not a picture of sexual assault. In an ordinary case, the defense would just say it only proves they were at a party together.” The problem, Murphy said, is that Maxwell is in the background and it is a picture that “has no innocent explanation, because there is no innocent reason for him to be hugging her, even in a social situation”. The settlement marks the end of Giuffre’s long journey from life as a south Florida teenager drawn into the Epstein-Maxwell sex trafficking conspiracy to prominent campaigner against the sexual abuse of minors. Giuffre, then Virginia Roberts, spent four years as Epstein’s personal masseuse, during which she alleges she was trafficked to the financier’s friends and clients. She now lives in Australia. In a 2009 civil lawsuit against Epstein, under the pseudonym “Jane Doe 102”, she alleged that her duties included being “sexually exploited by Epstein’s adult male peers, including royalty”. Giuffre reached a $500,000 settlement with Epstein in that case before it went to trial. She also sued and settled for an undisclosed sum with Maxwell in a 2015 defamation suit. Giuffre filed the current civil lawsuit against the duke for sexual abuse, battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress just five days short of the closing of a window in statute of limitations in New York’s Child’s Sex Act. The original image showing Giuffre, the duke and Maxwell together at Maxwell’s home, before, her lawyers claim, she was sexually abused by the duke, is reportedly lost. Ahead of the settlement, the duke’s lawyers asked Giuffre to hand over the original, anticipating arguing that it was fake. But according to the Daily Beast, nobody on Giuffre’s legal team knows where it is, or has ever seen the original photograph. The picture, taken on Giuffre’s own camera, had allegedly been packed into a box and shipped from Colorado to Sydney sometime between between 2011 and 2016, when Giuffre emigrated to Australia. It remained unseen, at least by the public, until the Mail on Sunday asked for evidence to Giuffre’s claim that she had been trafficked by Epstein and Maxwell – who is now awaiting sentencing after being convicted of sex trafficking in December – to support her claims that she had been forced to have sex with a number of prominent figures. It later emerged, during a 2016 deposition as part of a defamation suit Giuffre filed against Maxwell, that the Mail on Sunday paid her $140,000 to publish it, as well as $20,000 for two interviews. During that deposition, Giuffre said she had lent the picture to the FBI in 2011 but had last seen it before she packed up her home to emigrate. It might, she said, be in her home, in storage at her in-laws’ or with “seven boxes full of Nerf guns, my kids’ toys, photos”. In November 2019, Andrew was asked about the photograph in an interview with Newsnight. “I don’t remember that photograph ever being taken. I don’t remember going upstairs in the house,” he said. The photograph is now perhaps one of the most infamous images of him. For Giuffre, the settlement has been described as a victory. “She has accomplished what no one else could: getting Prince Andrew to stop his nonsense and side with sexual abuse victims,” said Lisa Bloom, a US lawyer who acted for eight Epstein victims. “We salute Virginia’s stunning courage.” Of the others involved in the picture, Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Maxwell faces spending the rest of her life behind bars. In a recent interview after Maxwell’s conviction, Giuffre said: “It takes time to heal, and this justice is part of the process. Now I can start really working past Maxwell and thinking about the others who need to be held accountable.” She added: “No matter how rich or how connected you are.”",News/UK news,How a picture came to symbolize the Prince Andrew sexual abuse case,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/15/virginia-giuffre-prince-andrew-picture-settlement-lawsuit
2/16/2022,"Good morning! There is plenty of commentary this morning about Prince Andrew’s surprise settlement with Virginia Giuffre, as well as developments in the face-off between Russia and Ukraine. The Duke of York has reached a settlement in the civil sex claim filed by Virginia Giuffre in the US. In the unexpected development, Prince Andrew agreed to make a “substantial donation” to Giuffre’s charity and accepted that she “suffered as an established victim of abuse”. The move is a remarkable turnaround for Andrew, who had pledged to fight to clear his name in court. A document submitted to court on Tuesday said the prince also regretted his association with the financier Jeffrey Epstein, who took his life in prison while facing trial for sex trafficking. The prince “was never going to win”, writes former Guardian royal correspondent Stephen Bates: “And now his stupidity and arrogance have cost him almost everything he values.”  The Morrison government is considering whether a little-known section of national environmental laws could be used to allow developments in some parts of the country to proceed without the need for federal approval. The move, revealed in documents released to Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws, could allow the commonwealth to reduce its role in environmental decision-making without needing support for a bill to transfer power to the states and territories, which has been blocked by the Senate since last year. The Coalition used its $187m safer communities grants program to fund at least 10 projects that had been deemed “unsuitable” by the department after the project applicants were visited in person by Peter Dutton’s assistant minister, Jason Wood. Over five rounds of the program, 225 applications were awarded funding worth $47.9m against the recommendations of the department. Of these, 23 projects worth a combined $7m were “assessed as either ineligible or unsuitable”. Russia claims it is withdrawing troops from near Ukraine’s borders but Kyiv and western diplomats remain cautious, while some residents are relieved. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said he had seen no sign yet of a withdrawal of troops and equipment. Nato’s scepticism was echoed by the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, who described the intelligence his government is seeing as “not encouraging”. Russian field hospitals were being constructed, which “only can be construed as preparation for an invasion”, Johnson said. Private school funding has increased at nearly five times the rate of public school funding over the past 10 years. Government funding for independent schools increased by $3,338 a student over a decade, compared with $703 more per student for public schools. Lethal “blackwater” in the Barwon-Darling River has prompted fears of another mass fish kill similar to the 2019 event in which more than a million fish died. Blackwater events are caused when heavy rains wash leaf litter that has collected on a floodplain into a major river, and expert say the problem is “accelerated by poor management”. The Future Fund has been forced to divest about $5m in taxpayers’ money from a Chinese state-controlled weapons manufacturer sanctioned for selling arms to the genocidal Myanmar military. Russia could extend the opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s imprisonment for up to a further 15 years in a fresh criminal trial at a penal colony far from his support base on charges of embezzlement. The New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has said there is “a very real risk” democracy will cease to exist in the US within a decade. She told the New Yorker that efforts by Republicans to restrict voting rights could result in a return to the Jim Crow era. The US west has spent the last two decades in what scientists are now saying is the most extreme megadrought in at least 1,200 years, according to a new study. It was by chance that Archie Roach met the woman who would be his collaborator and the love of his life. Their love story is the subject of the writer-director Philippa Bateman’s new documentary Wash My Soul in the River’s Flow, to be released in cinemas in March. “Archie is my silent hero and I’m his rowdy troublemaker,” Ruby Hunter says in the film. “She just had this cheeky way about her,” Roach recalls. “Not so much making trouble but had this glint in her eye.” “When my son Connor first told me he was transgender and was not, in fact, the daughter I thought he was for the first 12 years of his life, I could have handled it a lot better,” writes Carolyn Tate. “It’s not that I kicked and screamed. I didn’t throw him out or call him vile names. I wasn’t even disappointed. It almost feels worse than all that: I didn’t believe him.” In our weekly interview about objects, comedian Dave Hughes shares his love of tennis, and the diaries he kept as an unemployed twentysomething: “I went to the Australian Open final a few years ago and saw Rafael Nadal play Roger Federer. I had front row seats, which I’d paid quite a bit of money for. As part of getting the seats, I got to keep some of the balls that Roger and Rafael used during the match. But sometime later my dogs got hold of them, chewed them up and they’re gone. I lost a part of history.” With more than 100,000 Russian troops at Ukraine’s border, there are fears Europe is facing its biggest military crisis since the second world war.

2/16/2022,"In an unexpected twist to a case that has been the subject of intense media scrutiny, documents submitted to a civil court in New York on Tuesday reveal that Prince Andrew plans to settle with Virginia Giuffre. She had claimed she was trafficked to have sex with the Queen’s second son on three occasions when she was 17, a claim he has consistently denied.  Prior to the settlement, the case was in the “discovery” phase, meaning that several witnesses, including Andrew and Giuffre, were lined up to give depositions. A civil sex assault trial was scheduled to follow between September and December. Andrew was reportedly introduced to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein by British media heiress Ghislaine Maxwell in 1999. Epstein killed himself in his jail cell after he was arrested for sex trafficking girls as young as 14 in 2019. Maxwell, Epstein’s co-conspirator who was recently convicted as a sex trafficker for luring girls into his orbit.Giuffre, who is now 38, has alleged that Andrew met her in the Tramp nightclub in London in 2001 and sexually assaulted her at Maxwell’s home in Belgravia, London. She said he assaulted her on two further occasions, at Epstein’s New York home and at an “orgy” on his private island in the Caribbean. Giuffre has also accused Andrew of engaging in sexual misconduct on other occasions as an associate of Epstein’s. It wasn’t until 2015 that details became public, when court documents filed in Florida in which Giuffre accused Epstein of trafficking her also alleged that Andrew had sexually assaulted her. In August last year, Giuffre filed suit in New York against the royal, citing battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Andrew attempted to block the lawsuit on grounds that Giuffre’s $500,000 2009 settlement with Epstein shielded him after this was unsealed on 3 January. However on 12 January Judge Lewis Kaplan ruled that that the suit could go forward. Kaplan also rejected Andrew’s claims that Giuffre’s civil allegations lacked necessary specificity. Andrew’s former assistant, Robert Olney, and Shukri Walker, who claims to have seen Andrew in the Tramp nightclub, were set to give their depositions following Andrew’s in March. Giuffre had not yet set a date in court for when she would give a detailed account of what happened. Andrew’s legal team had asked to question Giuffre’s husband and her psychologist, claiming that she “may suffer from false memories”. Giuffre’s lawyer has said separately that their strategy was “to attack her character, her moral credibility”. A date in March had been set for Andrew to give evidence under oath. Absolutely not. Andrew has strenuously denied the accusations until this point and has said he would never settle. Last month, his lawyers said he was not a co-conspirator of Epstein, demanded a jury trial and listed several reasons why they believe Giuffre’s case should not stand.Giuffre’s lawyer had also insisted she wanted the case heard in court and that she would be unlikely to accept a “purely financial settlement”. He added that any resolution must “vindicate her and vindicate the other victims”.It is thought the settlement will come as a relief to the Queen, since the royal family had feared the court case would overshadow platinum jubilee celebrations this year. The full details, including the sum that Andrew will pay out, are not disclosed in the document, but Andrew has agreed to make a “substantial donation” to a charity supporting victims’ rights, and has accepted that Giuffre “suffered as an established victim of abuse”. He makes no admission of liability. In the document he also commends Giuffre’s bravery and regrets his association with Epstein, stating that Andrew will demonstrate this “by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims”. The text further outlines how Giuffre will dismiss the case once she receives the settlement. Andrew’s reputation and standing within the royal family have taken a serious beating. Andrew stepped back from his public duties as a member of the royal family in 2019 after a disastrous BBC TV interview where he claims he could not have had sex with Giuffre because he was at home after a visit to Pizza Express in Woking. He also attempted to refute Giuffre’s claim that the royal was “sweating profusely all over me” when they met at Tramp, stating he had a “peculiar medical condition which is that I don’t sweat or I didn’t sweat at the time”. The Queen stripped her son of a range of military affiliations and royal patronages.",News/UK news,Prince Andrew’s settlement with Virginia Giuffre: what just happened?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/15/prince-andrews-settlement-with-virginia-giuffre-what-just-happened
2/16/2022,"News of the Duke of York’s settlement was met with silence by Buckingham Palace. There was no official comment from the Queen, who just last month sought to distance the monarchy as an institution from the fallout over her second son’s legal woes. But it is understood that the very decisive action taken by the Queen last month, when she stripped Prince Andrew of his royal patronages, honorary military titles and any official use of his HRH title, still stands firm.  Indeed, it would be hard to imagine a return to royal duties and public engagements given that the out-of-court settlement announced on Tuesday raises many questions, but answers none. Andrew does not, in the statement, dispute the very serious allegation of sexual assault put by Virginia Giuffre in her civil case. Nor does he admit it. His lawyer had previously in court dismissed the case as “baseless” and accused Giuffre, who settled her claim against Jeffrey Epstein for $500,000 in 2009, of seeking another “payday”. The announcement of the settlement is unlikely to exonerate Andrew in the court of public opinion. So, his patronages are very unlikely to be returned to him – indeed, they are already being shared out among other members of the royal family. He will remain sidelined in any official royal capacity. Yet he is the Queen’s son. In the three years since Giuffre dropped her legal bombshell, the Queen has made clear her support through her actions. Andrew has been invited to Balmoral. The Queen allowed him to play a prominent part in the public tributes to the Duke of Edinburgh after his death last April. She and Andrew have been riding together. And it is possible we will see him during her platinum jubilee celebrations in June, as a member of her family. Andrew now faces paying a hefty bill in legal costs and an undisclosed sum that could run into millions. One unconfirmed report put it at £7.5m, while lawyers said it could exceed £10m. It is not known if the Queen, who supported Andrew’s royal work from the private income she receives from the Duchy of Lancaster estate, will be contributing to his costs and settlement. Andrew recently sold a Swiss ski chalet that he bought in 2014 with his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson for a reported £18m. Royal and legal experts hailed the settlement as good news for the institution, if not for Andrew. David McClure, an author on royal finances, tweeted: “This was always the only outcome for the royal family in terms of damage limitation.” Nick Goldstone, a lawyer with the disputes resolution firm Ince, said of the out-of-court settlement: “A good day for the royal family. A huge relief for that institution. Probably a good day for Ms Giuffre and a recognition of the impossible position Prince Andrew was in and the cessation of hostilities.” He said: “A ‘settlement in principle’ needs to be ratified by court order and until we see that, I would not hold your breath. Clearly this is a settlement on very generous financial terms for the complainant and a degree of back pedalling by the defendant. “In terms of ‘the court of public opinion’, this looks likes an admission of bad conduct on the part of Andrew and I suspect he will remain ‘off-stage’ from the royal family for the rest of his life. Perhaps he intends to rehabilitate himself by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking and supporting its victims over the years. What appears to have truly motivated him has been his loss of honorary title and royal associations.” The settlement was announced weeks before Andrew was scheduled to give a deposition in the case under oath to Giuffre’s lawyers. The statement marks a change of tone from Andrew compared with his infamous Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis in 2019, during which he failed to express sympathy for Epstein’s victims. The court document states that Andrew “regrets his association with Epstein, and commends the bravery of Giuffre and other survivors in standing up for themselves and others”. The royal author Penny Junor said: “At last he’s expressing some regret and some empathy for those girls.” The Newsnight interview had been “all about him” she said. “He’s got it right now, it took him a long time to get there but I think he’s got it right.” Asked if there was a way back to public royal life for the prince, she replied: “I think it’s very, very unlikely.” Andrew would be “for ever tainted”, said Joe Little, the editor of Majesty magazine. “I just don’t think he’s ever likely to resume work as a working member of the royal family. I think that too much water has gone under the bridge for that and the institution of monarchy has been tainted by his association with Epstein and I just think that there’s no going back on all that.” Of the likely reaction of the rest of the royal family, he said: “I’m sure that they’re glad this [settlement agreement] has happened, but does it exonerate the prince who really has not been charged with anything criminal? He will, I think, for ever be tainted by this scandal, for want of a better way of describing it.”",News/UK news,Prince Andrew’s settlement raises many questions but answers none,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/15/prince-andrew-settlement-virginia-giuffre-raises-many-questions-but-answers-none
2/16/2022,"Covid vaccination reduces the risk of developing long Covid, while current sufferers may experience an improvement in symptoms after getting jabbed, a comprehensive review by the UK Health Security Agency suggests. The ‘rapid evidence briefing’ drew together data from 15 UK and international studies, about half of which examined whether Covid vaccination protected against developing long Covid if someone had never been infected, while the rest looked at the impact of vaccination among people who already had long Covid.  It found that, as well as any benefit obtained by not catching the virus in the first place, those who do catch it are less likely to develop long Covid if they have received one or two doses of vaccine compared with unvaccinated individuals. According to the two studies that measured individual long Covid symptoms, the fully vaccinated were less likely than unvaccinated people to develop medium- or long-term symptoms such as fatigue, headache, weakness in the arms and legs, persistent muscle pain, hair loss, dizziness, shortness of breath, loss of smell or scarring of the lungs. “There is also evidence that unvaccinated people with long Covid who were subsequently vaccinated had, on average, reduced long Covid symptoms, or fewer long Covid symptoms than those who remained unvaccinated,” the review said. There were, however, some people who reported worsened symptoms after vaccination, it added. Deborah Dunn-Walters, chair of the British Society for Immunology Covid-19 taskforce and a professor of immunology at the University of Surrey, said there wasn’t yet enough information to explain why vaccination should lead to an improvement in people’s symptoms. “The term ‘long Covid’ covers a wide range of post-Covid conditions and so we don’t yet fully understand all the processes involved,” she said. One theory is that it may help clear up remaining reservoirs of virus in the body, or fragments of virus that are triggering ongoing inflammation. Another possibility is that vaccination rebalances the immune response in individuals whose symptoms are being driven by autoimmune-like processes – this may also explain why a few people report worse symptoms after vaccination, Dunn-Walters added. She said: “This review reemphasises the importance of everyone, no matter their age, getting vaccinated against Covid-19. Although there has been a high uptake of the vaccines in the UK so far, a significant number of people still need to come forward for a first or second dose. We must continue to make every effort to reach these people and encourage them to come forward for Covid-19 vaccination.” Prof Stephen Powis, the national medical director of NHS England, said: “With more than 10,000 people in hospital with Covid [in the UK], this study is a timely and important reminder that vaccines remain our best protection against the virus, reducing the chances of becoming seriously unwell as well as the effects of long Covid.”",News/World news,"Vaccination reduces chance of getting long Covid, studies find ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/15/vaccination-reduces-chance-of-getting-long-covid-studies-find
2/16/2022,"Aday after Canada’s prime minister announced a dramatic escalation in his government’s fight against blockades across the country, protesters in the nation’s capital were scheduling hair cuts and receiving massages, apparently unfazed by the prospect of ramped-up police enforcement. Hundreds of semi-trucks which have been parked out front of Canada’s parliament since late January have become emblematic of the protests, but planning and logistics for the occupation is run from a second site in a hotel parking lot on Coventry Road, five kilometres east of the downtown area.  Sandwiched between a baseball diamond and a detachment of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the encampment offers meals, shelter, warm clothes and restrooms for the protesters. It also has barber services and two saunas. Jeff, a retired trucker who arrived in Ottawa 17 days ago, said a shared sense of purpose has only increased the protesters’ resolve. “There’s a sense of unity here – and I think it’s only increased since yesterday. When you’ve seen the light, it’s hard to [go] back to the dark.” Justin Trudeau announced on Monday he would invoke the Emergencies Act, granting the government broad powers as it seeks to dismantle a three-week old blockade that has paralysed Ottawa. Protesters also blocked the Ambassador Bridge, the busiest crossing between the US-Canada, for six days before police dispersed them on Sunday. Two other border crossings reopened Tuesday, while a fourth crossing in Manitoba province remained blocked. And on Tuesday, in a tacit acknowledgement that the barricades in the capital were becoming increasingly entrenched, Ottawa police chief Peter Sloly stepped down. Meanwhile, camp residents were holding an “open-mic” event to share their stories. “Everyone here had a story of loss, or tragedy,” said Jeff. “So many people have suffered in these last few years. They’ve lost jobs, they’ve lost homes, they’ve lost family. That’s why they’re here.” The high level of organization – with delegated roles and a growing cadre of volunteers – reflects protesters’ intentions to remain in the city for the foreseeable future, despite opposition from local residents and the increasing exasperation of city, provincial and federal governments. The emergency legislation includes measures intended to put immense pressure on protesters, including the possibility of losing their commercial vehicle licenses, but none of the camp members said they were prepared to leave. “We knew Trudeau would try to batter us. We knew it was coming,” said Angel Godsoe, a small business owner from Lindsay, Ontario. “We’re the ones standing on guard for Canada. We’re the ones that care about saving our country.” Godsoe spends her morning helping to assign jobs, including security patrols and the transportation of fuel down to the trucks outside parliament (which is illegal under city bylaws). On the desk in front of her are sign-up sheets, binders with job descriptions and a growing list of volunteers. “You should see my desk at home,” said the mother of nine. “I haven’t been able to do my taxes in two years.” A steady stream of camp residents and new arrivals passed through the tarpaulin doors of the tent, either popping in to say hello or to find a job to help out. “Do you do laundry?” asked one trucker, who had spent the last few days in her truck near parliament. After a brief discussion, Rosalind, a nurse, offered to do the laundry at her house. A resident of Ottawa, Rosalind came out of retirement to help out in during the surge of coronavirus cases that overwhelmed the city’s hospitals. But she was terminated after she refused to get a Covid-19 vaccination. “If she’d kept her job, she wouldn’t be here with us,” said Godsoe. Some in the encampment claimed that like 88% of Canadians above the age of 5, they were fully vaccinated, but were nonetheless frustrated with the lengthy and restrictive nature of both provincial and federal public health measures. Others invoked global conspiracy theories to justify the protests. While protesters say the federal government’s enforcement actions did not come as a surprise, some have nonetheless taken defensive steps. “I pulled all of my money out my bank account last night and transferred it to my husband,” said Glory, a Christian blogger who has spent the last six days living in the camp. “We’ve got people here who lost their jobs. People who can’t pay their mortgages,” said Godsoe. “One trucker told me he last cried when his child was born 17 years ago. And this week he said he’s cried three times.” Ontario’s government announced on Monday it would speed up its re-opening, dropping capacity requirements for restaurant and businesses, as well as drop its vaccine passport on March 1. But those at the camp, whose protests against vaccine mandates and broader public health measures have snarled key trade routes across the country and paralyzed sections of Ottawa, were skeptical. “We just don’t believe them,” said one camp resident. “They can’t be trusted. Until we see proof of it, we’re not going to take them at their word. Campbell says he never imagined the protests would evolve into a sustained presence in the city, with a fully operational camp. But he said he had no intention of leaving any time soon. “Something’s gotta change. So much of what the government is doing is dividing us,” said Campbell. “I don’t know what’s going to happen from here. But something special is here and it’s really fired people up.”",News/World news,"Saunas, haircuts, hot meals: Ottawa protesters set up for the long haul",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/15/ottawa-truck-convoy-protesters-unfazed-by-emergencies-act
