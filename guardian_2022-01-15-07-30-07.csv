1/15/2022,"Thomas Tuchel has admitted Chelsea have underperformed after allowing Manchester City to sail clear at the top of the Premier League. Chelsea are 10 points below City before visiting the champions on Saturday and Tuchel, who feels that injuries have hurt his side, said that he expected to mount a stronger title challenge. The manager acknowledged that the European champions had dropped too many unnecessary points, though he has not given up on catching Pep Guardiola’s team.  “We would love to be closer to City,” Tuchel said. “We are never happy when we are behind our own standards and this is where we are. We have at the same time trust. We are still hungry. The season is not finished. We will never give up. “At the same time we have to say City is not only performing but also overperforming, not making mistakes, winning tight games, pushing luck on their side, so at some point you need to be fair and accept it, be realistic. It helps in life if you’re not a dreamer and you’re not pessimistic.” Chelsea’s search for cover at left wing-back has seen them recall Kenedy from his loan at Flamengo. Ben Chilwell is out for the season and Tuchel wants Emerson Palmieri back from his loan at Lyon, who do not want to release the Italy defender. Lyon’s manager, Peter Bosz, said on Friday that the French club would keep Emerson. Chelsea have also targeted Barcelona’s Sergiño Dest, who can play on both flanks. There is no recall option for Emerson and Lyon have rejected three offers of compensation from Chelsea, who have been forced to make insurance plans. Ian Maatsen, on loan at Coventry, is injured and Tuchel said that Kenedy, who has not played for Chelsea for four years, would be given an opportunity. There is a chance the Brazilian will go on loan again. There is currently no space for Kenedy in Chelsea’s 25-man squad for the Premier League, although Lewis Baker and Ross Barkley could make room for the 25-year-old by leaving. “Cross the river when you are at the river,” Tuchel said. “We are not at the river yet. He has to show if he is able to and if it’s his dream to make his mark. I like the guy, I like his personality and I like the player. “I saw him not only as Chelsea manager, but also when he played for Chelsea. I remember him playing for Newcastle. But let’s be realistic, it’s a long time ago. We will not decide it today and not tomorrow. We have time.” Chelsea will be without Andreas Christensen against City after the centre-back tested positive for Covid-19. Reece James and Trevoh Chalobah are injured.",Sport/Football,Thomas Tuchel concedes Chelsea playing ‘behind our own standards’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/14/thomas-tuchel-chelsea-playing-behind-our-own-standards-manchester-city
1/15/2022,"Antonio Conte has refused to offer assurances over his future at Tottenham, saying his focus was purely on the present and nothing later because “later could be too late”. The manager, who signed only a 20-month contract when he succeeded Nuno Espírito Santo in November, is keen to upgrade his squad during this month’s transfer window, having repeatedly described it as not strong enough.  Conte has applied not-so-subtle pressure on the chairman, Daniel Levy, with a string of messages about what he feels he needs and the one he delivered on Friday took in the apocalyptic fears of the club’s fans. They are terrified that Conte could quit if he is not backed by Levy with signings. There is no suggestion that Conte would be ready to walk out in February if he did not get what he wanted – the summer window could be a different story – although he remained in the mood to be provocative. “Honestly, I like to live in the present and not to think a lot for the future,” Conte said, when asked whether he could guarantee he would still be at the club after the January window and the one that followed in the summer, whatever happened. “It’s important to live in the present, to try to improve the situation ... because the present is now, the future is later. And later could be too much late for us. We have to be focused on the present. Then we will see.” Conte was pushed on the subject and he did say that he was enjoying his time at Spurs and had a “good relationship” with Levy and the managing director of football, Fabio Paratici. Conte added: “I want to work, I want to improve this team and, I repeat, we have to be focused on the present because, for sure, I want to improve, we want to improve.” Conte tends to be more outspoken, more political, leading up to and during a transfer window and there is no doubt that he is manoeuvring from a position of strength. He is a proven winner, whom the Spurs support consider themselves fortunate to have, especially after the failed tenure of Nuno, whereas Levy has precious little credit in the bank with some of them. On the other hand, if history has shown us anything it is that Levy does not like to be strong-armed. Spurs’s recruitment has been underwhelming since 2016-17 – the season when Conte first came to England to manage Chelsea – and, of their purchases who have cost more than £10m, perhaps only Lucas Moura and Pierre-Emile Højbjerg have been successes, although hopes remain high for Cristian Romero. It is a major reason why Conte has complained that the club have slipped from contenders to what he calls a “middle” level. He is desperate for them to get their next signings right, to see his own ambitions matched. “Yes, for sure,” Conte said. “I don’t lose my ambition and this must be very clear. I like to fight for something important. I don’t want to lose my will, my desire. Otherwise I will go against myself. I have to be the same person in every moment.” Conte has cut an increasingly frustrated figure of late, despite his positive record in the league – five wins, three draws and no defeats. He has lamented the squad’s lack of depth, the gap to the top teams and, when asked whether he realised the scale of the task at Spurs would be so big, he started laughing. “I decided to accept this job because to work in this environment, to work in a modern club, is good for every coach,” Conte said. “As you know very well, when you’re outside, you can imagine the situation. Then, when you are inside the situation, you can understand every aspect very well.” It feels unlikely that when Conte was persuaded to take the role, he was led to expect a squad overhaul in January. He sidestepped a question on this, saying that because he had not yet lived through a transfer window with Spurs, he could not comment on what they had to spend. Conte said: “I enjoy working at Tottenham because I found a fantastic environment, amazing stadium and fantastic training ground. For sure we have to bring the level of the team [up] to the same level as our infrastructure.”",Sport/Football,‘I like to live in the present’: Antonio Conte leaves his Spurs future uncertain,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/14/antonio-conte-leaves-tottenham-future-uncertain-spurs-transfers
1/15/2022,"Pep Guardiola has dismissed claims by Thomas Tuchel and Virgil van Dijk that Manchester City are the Premier League’s runaway leaders because they have suffered less from Covid. In an apparent sign that Guardiola does not believe City get the recognition they deserve, he noted how at other times money has been cited to explain his team’s success.  City host Tuchel’s Chelsea on Saturday leading the European champions by 10 points. They are a further one ahead of Liverpool, for whom Van Dijk plays, though Jürgen Klopp’s team have a game in hand. Guardiola was asked about the comments of Tuchel and the centre-back. “If they believe it’s the reason why then maybe,” he said. “Sometimes it’s the money that we have, sometimes it’s Covid. I don’t know. I say what I said before: the situation is [the same with the virus] all around the world. We had injuries, we had Covid. Maybe we don’t say which players – out of respect the club don’t do it – but we had a lot of players and backroom staff with Covid and at the beginning of the season we had a lot of tough injuries with our players. “So what can I say? If they believe we were lucky, OK we were lucky. We are exposed every single minute and day to getting it and so are no exception.” Tuchel said: “They did not suffer from Covid like we did. This is a huge difference.” Last week Van Dijk said: “City got through the month of December particularly well – they had few injuries and few corona cases and that helps enormously.” Guardiola is out of isolation after contracting the illness but City have new cases, though he did not specify whether these are players. “We have some new cases,” he said. “They want privacy so I cannot tell you [how many].” His side have won their past 11 league matches. “The fact we are here is because we were consistent in the toughest months – November and especially December– where there are many games and how we overcame the toughest situations that we had in the squad and problems with injuries and Covid,” he said. “We got results when we played really good [but] when we didn’t play good, eg at Arsenal, we were able to win. Saying that, my opinion of Liverpool and Chelsea doesn’t change due to the fact that right now we have this advantage. “They are more than excellent teams. One is the champion of Europe, the other has been our biggest rival for four seasons and they maintained their quality. If you had told me one month ago we would be in this position – 10 points clear – I would say it was impossible because I couldn’t expect they would drop those points. But football changes so quick.”",Sport/Football,Pep Guardiola hits back at suggestions Manchester City’s lead is down to Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/14/pep-guardiola-rejects-suggestion-manchester-city-lead-is-down-to-covid
1/15/2022,"This fixture always has a habit of leaving things late. With Crystal Palace leading thanks to a brilliant strike from Conor Gallagher - his seventh Premier League goal of the season - a third successive win here for Patrick Vieira’s side seemed on the cards. Yet having rescued a point against the team they like to beat more than any other earlier in the season, this time it was an own goal from Joachim Andersen that came to Graham Potter’s salvation. It’s now six matches since Brighton beat their bitter rivals, with Potter still yet to taste victory since taking over in May 2019. But this will have at least felt positive after they had fallen behind with 20 minutes to play.  This was Palace’s second away derby in the space of six days after their feisty victory over Millwall in the FA Cup on Saturday, with Vieira admitting this week that the last-minute equaliser Brighton scored at Selhurst Park in September to deny them three points was still “in our mind”. He named six players aged 23 or younger in his starting line-up – the first Palace manager to select such a youthful side since caretaker Attilio Lombardo in March 1998 – as they attempted to end a sequence of seven matches without winning a Premier League match on a Friday. After morale-boosting victories over Brentford and Everton, Brighton came into this match with their best points tally after 19 games of a top-flight season since 1982. They ended that campaign 13th in Division One, which remains the club’s highest-ever finish, and hopes are high on the south coast that this team can set a new standard under Potter. He made seven changes from the side that edged past West Brom in the Cup, with Leandro Trossard paired with Neal Maupay in attack and a diamond formation in midfield with Adam Lallana at the base. These are always boisterous occasions and the decision to play the game on a Friday night certainly added some extra spice to proceedings. The sizeable contingent of away supporters behind Butland’s goal had a perfect view of the game’s first opening in the 10th minute after a dreadful mistake from Joel Ward presented the ball to Marc Cucurella. Luckily for the Palace captain, his goalkeeper came to the rescue with an excellent save to deny Trossard that at least made partial amends for his error against Millwall at the weekend. Palace had surprisingly dominated the midfield during their encounter earlier in the season but it was a different story here, with Brighton pinning them in their own half through their full-backs, Cucurella and Joel Veltman. Actual goalscoring opportunities remained elusive, however, until the intervention of VAR in the 35th minute. Will Hughes may consider himself unlucky to have been spotted but he did have his arm around Veltman’s neck as the ball came into the area and referee Robert Jones had no option but to award the penalty. After a brief delay when a flare was thrown on to the pitch, the spot-kick from Pascal Gross lacked power and conviction and Butland was able to comfortably make the save. Yet the drama wasn’t over. From the resulting corner, Butland grasped Adam Webster’s header just before Maupay was able to knock the ball out of his hands and into the net, with VAR again ruling correctly that he had been fouled on the line. After such a breathless ending to the first half, Palace kept their opponents waiting at the start of the second but almost fell behind three minutes in when Jakub Moder’s delightful flick from Gross’s cutback struck the top of the crossbar. Having spent most of the evening largely as a spectator, Robert Sánchez was then called into action to save from Webster after the defender’s attempted clearance from a Conor Gallagher cross was heading towards goal. It wasn’t long before Butland was back in the thick of things, once again denying Moder after he was played in by Alexis Mac Allister. An injury to Lallana then forced Potter into a change of formation, with Tariq Lamptey’s introduction producing a positive reaction from the home fans. Yet it was Gallagher who stunned them into silence with a fantastic team goal that started with a mazy dribble out of defence from Marc Guéhi and featured touches from half of the Palace team. Jeffrey Schlupp did brilliantly to keep the ball and then found the Chelsea loanee to slam home on the volley. Brighton poured forward as they attempted to find a way back into the game and it eventually came when Maupay wriggled free down the left and Andersen could only divert the ball past Butland at the near post. A late Maupay header almost won it for Brighton late on but a draw just about felt like a fair result in the end.",Sport/Football,Joachim Andersen own goal earns Brighton point against Crystal Palace,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/14/brighton-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report
1/15/2022,"Prince Andrew’s longtime accuser Virginia Giuffre is seeking testimony from his former equerry, according to court papers in her sexual abuse lawsuit against the royal. Giuffre’s attorneys said Friday that they had “reason to believe” that Robert Olney, the Duke of York’s past assistant, has “relevant information about Prince Andrew’s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein”.  Giuffre, now 38, alleges she was forced into sex at 17 with Andrew by two of his then associates: Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Epstein, a convicted sex offender and financier, was arrested in July 2019 for sex trafficking girls as young as 14. He killed himself in a Manhattan jail about one month later, while awaiting trial. Maxwell, daughter of the British press baron Robert Maxwell, was convicted of sex trafficking and related charges last month for bringing girls as young as 14 to Epstein for him to abuse. Andrew has denied all allegations of misconduct. Giuffre’s lawyers also wrote in court filings that Olney’s name “appears in publicly available copies of Epstein’s phone book”. The attorneys said in court filings that they would like to question Olney about Andrew’s relationship with Epstein and Maxwell. Giuffre’s lawyers also said they wanted to ask him about “any communications with or regarding plaintiff,”, as well as Andrew’s travel to New York City and “to or from any of Jeffrey Epstein’s homes”. Giuffre’s attorneys have also requested testimony from Shukri Walker, who said that she saw Andrew at Tramp Nightclub in London “with a young girl around the time that plaintiff contends Prince Andrew abused her in London after visiting Tramp Nightclub. “Because Prince Andrew has denied ever meeting plaintiff or being at Tramp Nightclub during the relevant time period, Ms Walker’s testimony is highly relevant,” Giuffre’s lawyers wrote. Walker’s name has previously surfaced as a potential witness to Giuffre’s interactions with Andrew at Tramp nightclub. Her attorney, Lisa Bloom, previously told the Guardian: “My client says she was there and she remembers the night clearly because she never saw a royal before or since. “She says Prince Andrew was happy, smiling and dancing, and Virginia did not look happy. My client was a trafficking victim herself and wants everyone to know that sex trafficking is real, ongoing and devastating,” remarked Bloom, who has represented several Epstein victims. “I gave the FBI all the details of my client’s story for further investigation,” Bloom also said. Giuffre’s attorneys revealed these names as they are asking Manhattan federal court judge Lewis Kaplan to formally ask British authorities for assistance obtaining this testimony. They are making this request for assistance as this testimony would be taken outside the US. Their request for testimony came in the wake of Kaplan’s refusal to dismiss Giuffre’s lawsuit. The fallout from Giuffre’s case against Andrew, as well as the heightened scrutiny over his past ties to Epstein and Maxwell stemming from her recent trial, has been swift. Buckingham Palace announced in a statement on Thursday: “With the Queen’s approval and agreement, the Duke of York’s military affiliations and royal patronages have been returned to the Queen. The Duke of York will continue not to undertake any public duties and is defending this case as a private citizen.” In their unsuccessful bid for dismissal of Giuffre’s case, the prince’s lawyers contended in legal filings and proceedings that her 2009 settlement with Epstein insulated Andrew from her lawsuit. Giuffre was awarded $500,000 in this settlement, which was unsealed on 3 January. Their agreement featured a provision that stated it released “second parties and any other person or entity who could have been included as a potential defendant … from all, and all manner of, action and actions of Virginia [Giuffre], including state or federal, cause and causes of action”. Andrew was not identified by name in this settlement. Kaplan, who noted that Andrew’s attempts at dismissing Giuffre’s suit mostly relied on this agreement, said it would be premature of him to toss her suit based on this question. “The court’s job at this juncture is simply to determine whether there are two or more reasonable interpretations of that document. If there are, the determination of the ‘right’ or controlling interpretation must await further proceedings.” Given Kaplan’s ruling, Prince Andrew is poised to face lengthy, and embarrassing, legal proceedings. Although most US lawsuits settle rather than proceed to trial, Giuffre’s attorney, David Boies, has said that she is unlikely to accept a “purely financial settlement”.",News/UK news,Virginia Giuffre seeks testimony from Prince Andrew’s former assistant,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/14/prince-andrew-sexual-abuse-lawsuit-testimony-virginia-giuffre
