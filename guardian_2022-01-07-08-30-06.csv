1/7/2022,"Good morning, happy Friday to those for whom such concepts of time are relevant and welcome to Five Great Reads, your weekday summertime wrap of interest, intrigue and great feature writing, lovingly handpicked by me, Guardian Australia’s pilates and pilaf editor, Alyx Gorman. If you’re looking for big headlines, you’ve come to the wrong place. Please allow me to divert you to the Morning Mail for a briefing on the day’s big stories, and to our live blog for news as it breaks – yes, that includes rolling Djokovic updates.  If you’re looking to receive this as an email, pop your address in the box below. For those already receiving this as an email, sorry I keep banging on about the box, it’s the nature of digital publishing. But on the plus side, you’re about to see a very cute picture as we move into our reads. For decades the mahogany glider has lived a precarious existence, with all known wild gliders living along a fragmented strip of coastal woodland just 120km long, Graham Readfern writes. Now conservationists are hoping a pocket of the tenacious creatures may be found in a second, secret home on nearby Hinchinbrook Island. Notable quote: Andrew Dennis, who is coordinating a project to save the gliders, says the sneaky little nectar eaters are hard to catch in traps, or on camera. Their only weakness? Raspberry cordial. “We have to spray quite a bit of it around the camera and the cages,” says Dennis. Very relatable animal description: “The gliders are awkward and vulnerable on the ground.” How long will it take me to read? About three minutes. In an extract from his new book the End of Burnout, Jonathan Malesic explains why you might be dreading the return to work right now – especially if you love your job. Notable quote: “The system that gives esteem to engaged employees also creates anxiety only quelled through working more intensively,” Malesic writes. “The cure is also the poison.” Historical gossip: Have you heard of Max Weber? One of the fundamental figures in sociology, the one who wrote The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism? The bro burned out like a matchstick. Malesic writes: “He spent five years dealing with “nervous exhaustion”. He went through several cycles of intense teaching and research, followed by physical and mental collapse.” How long will it take me to read? Five minutes. Oscar winning director Andrea Arnold on her new documentary, Cow, which writer Simon Hattenstone calls “one of the most beautifully crafted and tender portraits of a life you are likely to see”. Tell me more about the cow? Her name is Luma, and she was chosen for the film because of her feisty personality. “They say the difference between humans and animals is that we can see the past and think about the future,” Arnold says. “But I could see Luma knew what’s coming when she’s pregnant. She got particularly mad when she saw the farmer taking away a calf from another cow.” It’s there in the name – we think of “revenge porn” as sexual imagery being posted by a vengeful ex. But the problem is far more diffuse, a “collector culture” perpetrated by legions online who gather, upload and archive nude images, with as much detail about the subjects as possible attached. Notable quote: “Women are prizes to be passed around, shared and traded like a dystopian version of Pokémon,” says Zara Ward, a senior practitioner at the Revenge Porn Helpline. “We often don’t know how these people gained the images in the first place – it could be exes, friends, or hackers ... All we see on the comments is women consistently and aggressively objectified, humiliated and exposed.” Is that happening here? Yes. Professor Nicola Henry, socio-legal scholar at RMIT, has studied the motives of perpetrators, and found “it’s … commonly related to sexual gratification or impressing online peers. “For instance,” she says “on some sites, images of wives and girlfriends are shared to get positive feedback from other users.” How long will it take me to read? Six minutes. But you’ll be haunted for much longer. When Jacqueline Housden came home to Australia mid-pandemic, young family in tow, after 18 years away, she knew it was “going to be an adventure/insane”, but that knowledge didn’t quite prepare her for life back at her parents’ place. A delightful scene: “Some rules were laid down. Mainly for the kids,” she writes. “There was … a special area the two boys were forbidden to enter, where my dad kept a prized clarinet. It didn’t take us long to break them. The next day, I spied my youngest, crouching silently in the no-go zone, concentrating, his sweaty hands fingering the keys.” We’ll do the reading and you can sit back and listen, with our new literary podcast Book It In.

1/7/2022,"Kamala Harris was inside the Democratic National Committee headquarters when a pipe bomb was discovered outside the building on 6 January last year, according to a report.  The then vice-president elect, who was sworn into office two weeks later, was evacuated minutes after Capitol police began investigating the bomb, Politico reported. The FBI described the bomb as a “viable” device which “could have been detonated, resulting in serious injury or death”. Citing anonymous sources, Politico said that Harris was evacuated from the DNC office in Washington at 1.14pm on January 6, seven minutes after police attended to the bomb. The threat from the pipe bomb was eventually neutralized at 4.36pm, while another bomb, found at the Republican National Committee headquarters, was nullified at 3.33pm. The news that Harris was, for a time, vulnerable to a potential explosion adds a new dimension to the events of 6 January. Harris is the first female US vice-president and first woman of color in the White House. As Harris was being escorted from the DNC building, Trump supporters were beginning to grapple with police on the steps of the Capitol building. Some of the group would breach the building a little over an hour later. No one has been arrested in connection with the DNC and RNC bombs, which the FBI believes were planted by the same person. The devices were planted on the evening of 5 January, and discovered the next day. In September, the FBI published a series of videos showing what it said was a suspect in the case. The agency, along with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to the identification of the person in the videos.",News/US news,"Kamala Harris evacuated on 6 January when pipe bomb discovered, report says",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/06/kamala-harris-dnc-washington-pipe-bomb-report
1/7/2022,"KISS frontman Gene Simmons, Australian musician Deborah Conway, and film-maker Nancy Spielberg are among 120 entertainment industry figures to sign an open letter against the boycott of Sydney festival, after more than 30 acts and individuals withdrew over the festival’s $20,000 sponsorship deal with the Israeli embassy. In the letter, published on Thursday by Creative Community for Peace, the signatories described the boycott as “an affront to both Palestinians and Israelis who are working to advance peace through compromise, exchange, and mutual recognition”.  “While we all may have differing opinions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the best path to peace, we all agree that a cultural boycott is not the answer,” it continued. The letter quoted comments made by Nick Cave in 2018, when he said: “The cultural boycott of Israel is cowardly and shameful. Israel is a real, vibrant, functioning democracy – yes, with Arab members of parliament – and so engaging with Israelis, who vote, may be more helpful than scaring off artists or shutting down means of engagement.” Nick Cave has not signed the 2022 open letter. Sydney festival opened on Thursday night hours after the withdrawal of another of its program highlights, Tropical Fuck Storm. Late on Thursday, the Gareth Liddiard-led band posted a strongly-worded statement about what it called the festival’s failure to “fix the problem they created”, which led to “online harassment” and “smear campaigns” aimed at the festival’s billed artists. “Sydney Festival [took] on a sponsor so dodgy, pointless and controversial it would inevitably mean that hundreds of unwitting artists (who are having a rough enough time with the pandemic as it is) would become the targets of online harassment, bullying, smear campaigns, ridiculous accusations, misrepresentations and abuse from total strangers who have no idea what’s actually going on behind the scenes, what any artist’s position is or even what they’re talking about,” the statement read. The band has joined more than 30 companies, individual artists and panel members of the festival’s the Reckoning series by either cancelling their gigs, or going ahead without the sponsorship or support of the official festival program. In the past 24 hours, comedian Tom Walker, singer/songwriter Hope D and artist Gerwyn Davies have also joined the boycott. In their statement, Tropical Fuck Storm said the band had been in discussion with the Sydney Festival over the past 48 hours about the possibility of refunding the Israeli Embassy’s $20,000 sponsorship of Decadance, a performance devised by Israeli choreographer Ohad Naharin and Tel Aviv’s Batsheva Dance Company, and co-presented by Sydney Dance Company. “Sydney Festival has stated they have no intention to refund the money or sever the sponsorship relationship, even though the shit sandwich they’ve landed every billed artist in is blatantly obvious to them,” they said. “Due to this complete lack of respect and integrity towards the artists billed from Sydney Festival and its partners, we have decided to cancel our two appearances.” All references to the Tropical Fuck Storm’s two Sydney Festival concerts had been removed online by the festival by Thursday evening. At the Sydney festival’s official media launch earlier on Thursday, artistic director Olivia Ansell told journalists that festival management and the board remained concerned about the controversy. On Tuesday, the board issued its second statement reaffirming its position that it would not be terminating its sponsorship with the Israeli embassy. “We’re always surprised by anything that disrupts the festival … it’s sensitive, something being created to bring artists together, so we can see a myriad of perspectives,” Ansell said. “We feel immense empathy with the situation.” Co-launching the festival with newly appointed NSW arts minister Ben Franklin, Sydney’s lord mayor Clover Moore said she was following the boycott debate closely. “The artists who are performing may or may not support the policies of their government, but they need to get funding from the government so that they can perform,” she said. “I just think about the Sydney Symphony and the Sydney Theatre Company who go overseas and perform,” she continued. “And it may very well be that there are people overseas who are angry about our inaction on climate change. They’re really concerned about our refugee policy, or our First Nations policy, but we wouldn’t want to see our Sydney Symphony or our Sydney Theatre Company boycotted for those reasons, because probably many people in both those institutions would not be supporting those policies either. “So I think it’s a matter for people to make up their own minds. But I think we should really keep in mind that this is about our artists and giving them an opportunity to perform.” Late on Thursday, the president of the Zionist Federation of Australia, Jeremy Leibler, sent Guardian Australia an extensive statement that included excerpts from a letter he wrote to the Sydney Festival, in which he described claims by boycott organisers, that by including an Israeli act the festival is excluding Palestinians and other Arabs, as “errant nonsense and worrying proof that the objective of those calling for a boycott is not a peaceful future for Israelis and Palestinians, but a future without Israel.” The letter from the federation went on to state: “The Sydney Festival should be a safe space to celebrate the artistry and gifts of all peoples, including Israelis and Palestinians. Instead, the boycott organisers have attempted to make the festival culturally unsafe for anyone who believes in freedom of speech, and the freedom to have differences of opinion. It is appalling behaviour and the the Jewish community condemns it outright. “If vitally important civil society organisations such as the Sydney Festival cave into campaigns from these extremist groups, it will only encourage them to continue this behaviour. We have seen throughout history that while these campaigns start with Israel and the Jewish people, they very rarely end there.”",Arts/Culture,"Gene Simmons, Deborah Conway join opposition to Sydney Festival boycott as more acts pull out",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/07/gene-simmons-deborah-conway-join-opposition-to-sydney-festival-boycott-as-more-acts-pull-out
