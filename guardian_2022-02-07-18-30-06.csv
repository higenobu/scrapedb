2/7/2022,"The most consistent downhill skier of all time finally added the lone piece of hardware missing from his trophy case on Monday when Switzerland’s Beat Feuz struck gold in the sport’s most prestigious event.  The 34-year-old from the tiny village of Schangnau won the Olympic men’s downhill title with a blistering trip down the unforgiving speed course known as the Rock in 1min 42.69sec, coming in a scant 0.10sec ahead of France’s Johan Clarey, who took the silver, and 0.14sec faster than Austria’s Matthias Mayer, who added a bronze to his Sochi gold of eight years ago. “I can’t think of anything more beautiful than flying home with a gold medal around my neck,” said Feuz, the four-time reigning World Cup downhill champion with a record 45 career wins in alpine skiing’s fastest discipline. “It was perfect weather, no wind, and I was just standing perfectly on the skis. A dream came true.” A jubilant Feuz tossed one of his skis high in the air in the finish area after seeing the green light indicating he had taken the lead with a run that knocked the Norwegian pre-race favorite Aleksander Aamodt Kilde off the podium. Thrown off by the extra speed of the upper sections of the 890m track, Kilde’s eventual fifth-place finish completed an underwhelming day for alpine skiing’s power couple after his partner Mikaela Shiffrin skied out of the women’s giant slalom earlier Monday. Experience proved a crucial asset in successfully negotiating the 40 gates along the unfamiliar man-made piste in the absence of the usual test events that allow skiers to get accustomed to the mountain. The men’s World Cup downhill and super-G races scheduled at the newly constructed facility on Xiaohaituo in February 2020 were among the first international sporting events canceled as the coronavirus outbreak took hold. Clarey, a 41-year-old who has never won a World Cup race in 19 seasons on the circuit, eclipsed the record for oldest alpine skiing Olympic medalist held by Bode Miller, who was 36 when he won bronze in the men’s super-G in 2014. And Mayer, a 31-year-old who won Olympic golds in downhill in 2014 and in super-G in 2018, joined Feuz as only the eighth and ninth skiers to win multiple Olympic downhill medals. “With all the delays and the conditions and everything that is around the downhill slope, I think to have some experience was OK today,” Clarey said. “You can see it on the podium.” Added Clarey: “I was pushing, pushing, taking a lot of risks. I knew I only had one chance left in my career to get a medal in the Olympics.” The 5ft 8in Feuz, who missed several seasons amid a series of persistent left knee injuries, entered the Beijing Games in a rich vein of form, having won last month’s famed Hahnenkamm downhill at Kitzbühel in addition to a pair of podiums in World Cup speed races. He also recently welcomed a second daughter with his longtime partner Katrin Triendl, a former Austrian slalom champion. With Monday’s dramatic win in the blue-ribbon event of the Winter Games, his resume is beyond reproach. Switzerland’s Marco Odermatt, the World Cup overall leader, finished 0.71sec back and in seventh, behind Italy’s Dominik Paris and ahead of Austria’s current double world speed champion Vincent Kriechmayr. Ryan Cochran-Siegle, the American whose mother won Olympic gold in slalom at the 1972 Sapporo Games, lost time before the first split and was unable to make it up on the lower sections. He came in 1.33sec behind Feuz and finished 14th. It didn’t take long for the treacherous course at the National Alpine Center to show its teeth. Germany’s Dominik Schwaiger, the second racer out of the starting gate, caught an inside edge while traveling at nearly 80mph toward the bottom of the course, lost a ski while caught in the safety netting and was evacuated by stretcher. Shortly after, Austria’s Daniel Hemetsberger finished his run with a bloody nose and mouth after colliding with a gate. The men’s downhill was initially scheduled to open the alpine skiing programme on Sunday but was postponed a day thanks to punishing 40mph gusts at the top of the course.",Sport/Sport,‘A dream came true’ – Beat Feuz wins blue riband men’s Olympic downhill,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/07/a-dream-came-true-beat-feuz-gold-men-olympic-downhill-skiing-bejing-2022
2/7/2022,"Sajid Javid has denied that a plan to clear the huge NHS backlog in England has been delayed because of wrangling with the Treasury over funding, as health bodies warned any further wait could exacerbate the scale of waiting lists for treatment. The health secretary, who had been scheduled to announce the plan on Monday, insisted it had simply been held up by chaos caused by the Omicron variant of Covid, and that it would come imminently.  Saffron Cordery, the deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts in England, said the plan should be published as quickly as possible to help the health service tackle the 6 million-strong backlog, which is set to rise further. “There has been no argument, there has been a very active discussion within both the NHS and my department to collectively agree on an elective recovery plan,” Javid told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We’ve got a plan. It is being finalised right now. It will be published very soon.” Cordery told the same programme: “We need to see this plan as quickly as possible because trust leaders are really keen to plough on and make their way through these very long waiting lists which have built up during the pandemic, and indeed pre-existed the pandemic. “What we’re waiting for is a set of priorities and measures and procedures that will be put in place to support trusts, to enable them to boost their activity levels, so it will be measures to free up clinician times, it will be measures to support trusts to work more effectively together.” Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, has warned health funding plans could face gridlock due to opposition from the Treasury, which might view the spending as “wasted on a dying administration”. But in another interview Javid denied he was at loggerheads with the chancellor, Rishi Sunak. Javid told Sky News: “What I would say about the Treasury is that I couldn’t wish for a better partner when it comes to the challenges that I have. “I don’t recognise that at all. Having been chancellor, having a close relationship with the Treasury, for any department, is crucial. And right now, for health and care, I’m just really pleased we’ve got that really good working relationship.” The plan was delayed “because we had a roadblock with Omicron”, Javid said, adding: “I had planned to publish the plan in December. We were almost there, we were agreeing it finally with the NHS and across government, but because of Omicron we’ve rightly changed our focus, especially to boosters and to focus on that.” The row comes as the numbers of cancer patients facing delays in seeing a specialist for the first time and starting their treatment have hit record highs in England. Half a million people in England with suspected cancer will have to wait longer than the supposed two-week maximum to see an oncologist this year, an analysis for the House of Commons library reveals. The number of patients confirmed to have the disease who are unable to start treatment such as surgery or chemotherapy within the 31 or 62 days that hospitals try to guarantee is expected to exceed 75,000 for the first time. Javid told Today it was inevitable waiting lists “will rise above 6 million over the coming months” as patients returned following the pandemic, before starting to fall.",News/Society,Sajid Javid denies row with Treasury behind NHS backlog plan delay,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/07/sajid-javid-denies-row-with-treasury-behind-nhs-backlog-plan-delay
2/7/2022,"A police officer charged with murdering an Aboriginal man had significant expertise in handling weapons but had rarely worked in remote communities, a court has heard. Zachary Rolfe, 30, allegedly shot dead Kumanjayi Walker in November 2019 while trying to arrest him in Yuendumu, about 300km north-west of Alice Springs.  After a series of delays, Rolfe’s trial started in Darwin on Monday. At the time of the fatal shooting, Walker was subject to an outstanding warrant. When Rolfe and his partner tried to arrest him, the 19-year-old Warlpiri man lashed out at them. Rolfe was stabbed in the left shoulder, and then allegedly shot Walker three times. The prosecution told the court on Monday that another officer was on top of Walker on a mattress when Rolfe fired the second and third shots. He is charged with murder in relation to those final two shots. If a jury finds him not guilty of murder, he faces a charge of manslaughter, and if he is found not guilty of that charge, a further charge of engaging in a violent act causing death. The police officer has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Prosecutor Philip Strickland SC told the Northern Territory supreme court in opening his case that he expected Rolfe would defend his actions during the incident in three ways: that he had acted in self-defence, that he was acting as a police officer and believed his actions were reasonable in the circumstances, or that he was acting in good faith in the exercise of his power under the police administration act. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Strickland said Walker and another officer, Constable Adam Eberl, had attended a property known as House 511 to arrest Walker about 7.20pm on 9 November, 2019. Strickland said that Rolfe fired the shots within a minute of Rolfe and Eberl entering the house. Strickland said Rolfe’s first shot – which he repeatedly reiterated was not part of the charges against Rolfe – occurred 2.6 seconds before the second shot. He said there was 0.53 seconds between Rolfe’s second and third shots. Strickland said that in police and defence terminology this was known as a double-tap, and was specifically used when shooting with semi-automatic weapons to inflict maximum damage. Strickland said the prosecution case, however, would not simply be about the events on the night of the shooting, but about the context in which it occurred. Rolfe had been a former soldier who had completed tours overseas including in Afghanistan, Strickland said, and was working with the Alice Springs Immediate Response Team, a police outfit that has access to higher powered weapons and paramilitary uniforms. “As at the time of the shooting he had extensive experience in handling firearms and weapons, but he had little experience in performing policing duties in remote communities … such as Yuendumu,” Strickland said.

Strickland told the court that on 6 November 2019, Snr Const First Class Christopher Hand and Snr Const Lanyon Smith attended another house at Yuendumu to arrest Walker. Strickland said he often stayed at the house with his partner. But when the officers tried to arrest Walker in a bedroom, he charged at them with a small axe, Strickland said, that he then dropped after he fled outside. “Now both Hand and Smith had considerable experience in policing in remote Indigenous communities,” Strickland said. “When Kumanjayi Walker was armed with that axe, neither Hand, nor Smith, thought it was necessary to draw their guns.” Strickland said that Hand later wrote in an email to Assistant Commissioner Travis Wurst about Walker: “I don’t think he wanted to chop us up, he just wanted to escape. “No one was injured, and that’s the best result in my view.” Strickland said Hand’s supervisor and partner, Sgt Julie Frost, who was officer in charge of the Yuendumu police station, also had experience in remote communities, and had previously worked in Yuendumu as a nurse. Frost and other officers, including an Aboriginal officer, spent the next few days speaking with the parents of Walker’s partner to negotiate his surrender, Strickland said. Strickland said the parents told police Walker had escaped from the rehabilitation facility because he had wanted to attend a great uncle’s funeral, which had been rescheduled to take place on 8 November. It was arranged he would hand himself in after that. But the funeral was again rescheduled, Strickland said, to the following day – the same night Walker was shot dead. Strickland said Rolfe had become aware of the “axe incident” on 7 November when he started a shift in Alice Springs. Strickland said Rolfe and his partner on that shift discussed how Smith and Hand had responded was wrong, and what they would have done differently. Rolfe and other officers also spent part of that shift searching for Walker in the Warlpiri camp in Alice Springs, Strickland said. Two days later, Rolfe and four other officers travelled to Yuendumu to arrest Walker. The trial before Chief Justice Michael Grant is set to continue for the next four weeks. Rolfe was supported in court by his parents, Debbie and Richard. The former soldier Heston Russell and officers from the NT police association also attended the hearing. Outside court, Warlpiri elders Lindsay Japangardi Williams and Ned Jampijinpa Hargraves said the community was still in pain about the shooting. Both men wore white paint on the foreheads, a sign that they are involved in sorry business. NT police association president Paul McCue said he was glad the trial had started and he looked forward to justice prevailing.",News/Australia news,"Zachary Rolfe: NT police officer involved in fatal shooting had ‘extensive’ firearms experience, court hears",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/07/zachary-rolfe-nt-police-officer-involved-in-fatal-shooting-had-extensive-firearms-experience-court-hears
2/7/2022,"Ihave met people, mercifully few in number, who just don’t respond to Chekhov. For me, his four main plays (Uncle Vanya, The Cherry Orchard, The Seagull and Three Sisters) are stone-cold masterpieces, timeless examinations of the human condition. But some people, slap them in the best seat in the stalls and they’ll ask what all the fuss is about: a whole lot of rich people complaining about nothing and achieving even less? And perhaps now, with Gary Shteyngart’s latest book, I’m beginning to understand their bewilderment. Our Country Friends, a Chekhov-inspired Covid novel, comes lauded with every form of praise from serious Americans, up to and including the word “masterpiece”. And yet here I am in the Crush Bar, staring into my G&T and wondering what I’m missing.  The initial premise is more Boccaccio than Anton Pavlovich. Sasha, a Russian-born and previously successful satiric novelist, has invited his closest friends up to his “house on the hill” somewhere on the east coast to sit out the disease now running rampant through New York. But it opens nevertheless like any good Chekhov – after a self-conscious page of dramatis personae, straight out of a 19th-century playscript – with old retainers running round, preparing the estate. Sasha has near-bankrupted himself to build four bungalows around the main house, each to safely accommodate a guest. There’s Vinod (Indian immigrant) and Karen (Korean immigrant), Sasha’s friends since maths high school. There’s Ed, also Korean, now a trust-fund idler, and Dee (surname Cameron, making sure we don’t entirely lose track of that Boccaccio analogy), a former creative writing student of Sasha’s, now firebrand essayist. And one extra guest is promised: The Actor. In a Trollopian touch, he is never awarded an actual name but again fills a classic Chekhovian role: the impossibly handsome and successful incomer (think Trigorin or Vershinin) who drives the men to despair and the women to masturbation, including Sasha’s psychiatrist wife Masha. And now, once they’re nicely settled in? They behave according to Standard Chekhovian Operating Practice: fall in love, bemoan their lack of fulfilment, fall out of love and then the estate is sold. In a slight deviation, a Shakespearean touch is required to trigger The Actor’s amour fou for Dee: Karen is a newly minted tech billionaire following the sale of her app, Tröö Emotions. This app, by toying with a selfie of two willing participants, somehow induces unstoppable love (usually). It’s slightly less credible than Oberon’s wild thyme bank but still generates the kind of intense, semi-requited passion that runs through most Chekhovs. Which is not to say that all the action is old world. Dee’s shtick is “y’all-ism”, trading on her Poor White Roots (think Hillbilly Elegy) but when the George Floyd murder erupts outside, bifurcating the country, she finds herself at the wrong end of Twitter for standing by “my people”, namely southern whites with racist inclinations. Social media may have anointed them “The First Couple of Quarantine” but now The Actor’s retinue strongly advises him to cut and run. But he is soon back, still agonisingly in love, and craving the antidote. Somehow Karen (off you go again, Puck) knows exactly what to say to him, which images of his former self to show him in order to explode this ersatz, algorithmic passion of his. She sits and talks him through it – bizarrely staying indoors, bungalow windows closed – and thus, the final Chekhovian piece slots in: bang goes that Covid gun that was on the wall in the first chapter. The disease has breached the commune. The American praise quoted on the dust jacket promises a “brilliant” “laugh out loud” tragicomedy, but I didn’t laugh and I didn’t cry. I wonder if too many of its culture-war references – the dark foreboding on the roads around the estate, a menacing “black pickup” which seems to embody the White Lives Matter backlash – simply lack the same pungency for a British readership. The friction between self-regarding Manhattan creatives and barely managing upstate farmers should be fertile enough ground for any novelist, but I constantly felt as though I’d forgotten to pack the codebook. Which left me with the mere domestic shenanigans of the characters, namely a whole lot of rich people complaining about nothing and achieving less.

2/7/2022,"Taylor Wimpey has appointed an internal candidate as its new chief executive, in a move likely to anger Elliott Advisors, the activist investor that was pressuring the housebuilder to appoint someone from outside the company. The appointment of Jennie Daly marks a milestone in the male-dominated industry as Taylor Wimpey becomes the first UK housebuilder to appoint a female chief executive and only the third company in the FTSE 100 to have a female CEO and a female chair.  Daly, who is group operations director, will take over from Pete Redfern, who has led the business for 15 years since it became the UK’s third biggest housebuilder through the merger of Taylor Woodrow and George Wimpey in 2007. The chair, Irene Dormer, said Daly’s skills “set her apart from the other candidates we were considering”. However, the move will inevitably spark a backlash from Elliott, which in December revealed it was one of the company’s top five investors and went public with demands including finding a new chief executive. In a nine-page public letter to Dorner, it said shareholders were “unlikely to support a chief executive candidate that represents an extension of the status quo at Taylor Wimpey”. “The successor must represent a clean break with the current management team,” Elliott wrote. “While there are talented members of the Taylor Wimpey team, any current leader would represent a continuation of the status quo, and have shared in the loss of trust and credibility with investors.” Elliott reportedly considered the Crest Nicholson chief, Peter Truscott, the former Persimmon boss, Dave Jenkinson, or the Barratt deputy chief executive, Steven Boyes, as its preferred candidates. Elliott has a reputation for aggressively picking battles at its restructuring targets, which have included the Argentinian government, the mining company BHP, GSK and Telecom Italia. “Jennie has extensive experience in the housebuilding sector and has demonstrated exceptional leadership and a razor-sharp operational focus,” Dorner said. “Her strong focus on execution, combined with her customer and people-focused skills, set her apart from the other candidates we were considering.” Daly, who joined Taylor Wimpey from Redrow in 2014, will officially takeover as chief executive at the company’s annual meeting on 26 April. Taylor Wimpey is still on the hunt for two non-executive directors. In the first half of 2021, the UK’s third-largest housebuilder finished a record number of homes, returned to profit and upgraded forecasts for the full year, the results for which it will publish in March. Analysts said Elliott was attracted to Taylor Wimpey because of Britain’s housing shortage and the firm’s hidden potential, including its land bank, but some believed it needed to improve its operational performance. Its shares have fallen by a quarter since February 2020.",News/Business,Taylor Wimpey picks internal candidate as CEO in slight to activist investor,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/07/taylor-wimpey-ceo-jeie-daly-activist-investor-elliott-advisors
