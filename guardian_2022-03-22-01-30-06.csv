3/22/2022,"Police have begun interviewing witnesses as part of their investigation into Downing Street parties during lockdown, after sending out questionnaires to more than 100 people accused of being involved – including Boris Johnson. The Met police issued an update on their work, suggesting the investigation may be some way off being concluded after two months of inquiries. In a statement, the force said it has not yet requested any fixed-penalty notices to be issued against alleged partygoers. It said: “This investigation involves a significant amount of investigative material; the serving of over 100 questionnaires and the need to individually assess every response. The offences under consideration comprise a number of elements and the legislation itself changed between the event dates. We are progressing the investigation as quickly as possible “As yet, we have not made any referrals to the ACRO Criminal Records Office for the issuing of fixed-penalty notices. However, every questionnaire response is being assessed alongside all available evidence, and should this reach the evidential threshold, then referrals will be made.”",News/World news,Downing Street parties: Met police begin interviewing witnesses ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/21/downing-street-parties-met-police-begin-interviewing-witnesses
3/22/2022,"For years, smuggling food and drink into cinemas has felt like a crime, but no more. Our wildest dreams have come true, and it has finally been confirmed that, yes, you can officially bring your own snacks to watch films in public places. It was actually back in 2019 that a Twitter user, @halilmemz, asked Cineworld, Odeon and Vue: “Am I allowed to bring my own food and drinks into the screen?” For some reason their answer – a unanimous yes – recently resurfaced online and has, once and for all, dismantled the long-held notion that audiences are only allowed to eat food bought in the cinema foyer. Does this revelation change cinema etiquette? Well, yes and no. On the plus side, if you have ever snuck a pack of corner-shop Haribo into a cinema under your jumper, you don’t need to do that any more. Put it in a bag. Carry it in your hand. Wave it at cinema employees for all it matters. You no longer have to feel ashamed about sneaking in snacks. However, don’t think you can bring along any food you like. Unless you’re at one of those fancy cinemas that serve meals in your seat, hot food is absolutely out of the question. Hot food can transmit smells much more effectively than, say, a grab bag of Cadbury Twirl Bites. Tuck into a burger or a curry in the middle of The Batman and you run the risk of offending the rest of the audience. This can happen. At one preview screening I attended years ago, a leading critic for a national newspaper flounced out of the film almost immediately because someone was eating a Big Mac. As an aside, cold food can also smell. South Korean cinemas often have signs banning people from eating dried squid during film viewings. So don’t do that either. Finally, just because you can bring in your own food, it doesn’t necessarily mean that you should. Cinemas barely made it through the pandemic intact, and many are still struggling. For the most part, audience numbers haven’t returned to pre-pandemic levels and, of the few tickets that do get sold, the lion’s share of the money goes straight to the film studios. The thing that quite often separates a cinema’s success from its failure is the money raised through its concession stand. If you can afford it – and it’s a big if – that pre-film bag of Maltesers is one of the best ways to demonstrate your loyalty to your local independent cinema.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Still sneaking your own snacks into the cinema?

3/22/2022,"“Manchester, are you ready to cause some carnage?” asks Tyron Frampton, AKA Slowthai. Rapper and audience alike have waited a year for him to tour his No 1 second album, Tyron, and soon turn the space into a sea of air-punching and rap-a-longs, although it’s a challenge to get near the 27-year-old’s trademark part-gruff, part-jittery delivery. His raw, unfiltered energy tipped into leery behaviour at the 2020 NME awards (referenced on Cancelled) which he will have learned from, but here he is every inch the roguish scamp with an audience eating from his hand. “The Guardian are here reviewing us,” he sniggers, momentarily turning this publication into pantomime villain. “Let’s give them a real review.” He’s as good as his word, packing 25 tracks into 80 minutes. The presentation – Slowthai in silhouette against either dazzling screens or blow-ups of his grinning fizzog, metal teeth’n’all – is Bez goofiness-meets-Blair Witch Project. There are walls of pyrotechnics and he divides the crowd into circle pits or halves, but for all the showmanship, there’s something deeply real about Frampton (background: Northampton council estate, teenage mum, hugely affected by the death of his baby brother). He seems to genuinely panic as he loses his setlist in the mayhem, but turns the incident to his advantage, teasing a strong-sounding new song. Otherwise, material from Tyron and 2019’s Top 10 debut, Nothing Great About Britain, ranges from hard-hitting, melodically pretty (the soulful I Tried) to herbert punk (Doorman), political to emotional. He can be bleakly funny: “Now I’ve got a son. I’ve got a fuckin’ HARSE!” he yells, and while the audience silently “aww” he delivers the punchline, “The thing I can’t find is a drug dealer”, to introduce, well, Drug Dealer. He can be weirdly touching, warmly hugging female rapper Deb Never (who duets on Push) or revealing that he was always told he’d never amount to anything “so doing this makes me tear up”. He is succeeding by being himself, and people love him for it.

3/22/2022,"Whether it is the rapidly shifting patois of teenagers or curious words found long-buried in the local argot of a rural community, our vocabularies are shaped by our social environs. Now, it seems, such influences might also be at play among orangutans. Researchers studying the “kiss-squeak” alarm calls of wild communities of the apes in Borneo and Sumatra have found that rather than such sounds being innate and hardwired, as was long thought, orangutans are able to come up with new versions of the calls, varying in pitch and duration. What’s more the frequency of novel calls – and whether the new versions stick – are influenced by the density of the local community. “The way I see it is that low densities [of] orangutans have a slang repertoire that they constantly revisit and use. They are ‘conservative’, but once a new call variant is used, everyone hears it and the variant is quickly incorporated, enriching the slang,” said Dr Adriano Lameira, first author of the research from the department of psychology at the University of Warwick. “In high density [communities of orangutans], communication is more like a cacophony. It seems ‘novelty’ is at a premium, much like in songbirds, and that individuals want to show off their coolness and how [much of a] rebel they are,” he said. While social influences have been found to play a role in communication for animals including song birds and marmosets, the team behind the new research say it had been unclear whether the same was true for non-human apes – an important question given our own communication is influenced by such factors. Writing in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution, the team report how they spent 6,120 observation hours working across six research stations between 2005 and 2010, opportunistically recording orangutan kiss-squeaks from around 70 individuals. Lameria said the different communities sometimes came up with the same new variations of the calls, although there is no known exchange between these populations, and they are very far apart. The team found high-density communities of orangutans used a wide range of novel calls, but with a high turnover, meaning many rapidly fell out of use. By contrast small groups came up with new calls less frequently, but tended to retain novel calls when they occurred. “We do not expect that social influence is restricted to alarm calls, these just happened to be the calls that were most immune to other possible influences,” said Lameria. Lameria added that in addition to the new study there is growing evidence that great ape repertoires, like human languages, are composed of consonant- and vowel-like calls which can not only be carefully controlled, but combined to make syllable-like combinations that can even be used to communicate about past events. “This new evidence cements a new view that great apes are highly desirable and unique model species to improve our [understanding] of language origin and language,” said Lameria. Indeed the team say the new findings add weight to the idea that human language evolved gradually, with communication among our ape-like ancestors likely also influenced by social factors. Lameria added the new study also highlighted the importance of conservation. “Great apes and their habitat must be preserved if we are to hold any chances of unveiling further pieces of the puzzle of language evolution,” he said.",News/Science,"Orangutans use slang to ‘show off their coolness’, study suggests",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/21/orangutans-use-slang-to-show-off-their-coolness-study-suggests
3/22/2022,"The nets where Barcelona had scored four times, twice at the north end, twice at the south, had been unhooked and hung flat. The benches had been vacated, bottles and bits of tape lying everywhere. And around the pitch, circled by those plastic chairs, people packed away another clásico. The Santiago Bernabéu was quiet except for the lawnmower crossing the grass until it was broken by a cheer, the sound of embraces. The players were already on the bus but Joan Laporta, Jordi Cruyff and Mateu Alemany were by the tunnel taking it all in when Xavi Hernández appeared. An hour after the final whistle, heading towards midnight and long after everyone else had gone home, there was time for one last look and more bear hugs. It really had happened: Barcelona, this Barcelona, had beaten Real Madrid 4-0, which is why there was time for pictures too, Xavi and his staff lined up for a team photo: a memento of the kind of moment most people thought wasn’t coming back. Not this soon, at least. But then Laporta isn’t most people and nor, it is becoming very quickly clear, is Xavi. During Barcelona’s presidential race just over a year ago, Laporta had erected a huge banner that covered the façade of a 15-storey building within view of the Bernabéu, his face smiling out, mischief in his eye. “Looking forward to seeing you all again,” the slogan ran, and that would turn out to be one electoral promise he would keep. On his first visit to the Paseo de la Castellana since becoming president for a second time, Xavi’s first as coach four months after taking over, and the first clásico played there at all for 749 days, had gone even better. “Historic,” Xavi called it. This was a night, the Barcelona manager said, that “reminded us of many games a long time ago.” He had been involved in many as a player, already an ideologue. He had led many of them too, and now he had done it as a manager. It was one that might not have mattered all that much mathematically – Madrid are still 12 points ahead of Barcelona, a fact which may have played a part – but it still felt like it fit with their best derbi moments, their story. As a coach Johan Cruyff had the 5-0 in 1995, emulated by Pep Guardiola’s team in 2009. Rinus Michels had a 5-0 back in 1974 with Cruyff the player; Frank Rijkaard had the 2005 night the Bernabéu gave Ronaldinho a standing ovation, Guardiola also had the 6-2 in 2009, and Luis Enrique had the 4-0 in 2015. On Sunday night, Xavi had one of his own. Not that the score alone tells this story. Madrid’s Nacho Fernández summed it up as “a very bad game from us, a very good game from them,” while the coach Carlos Ancelotti explained it by saying: “Simply, they played better than us,” admitting “everything went wrong”. The headlines in Madrid inevitably took inspiration from their kit, which wasn’t white or deep purple, to call this a “black night.” Thibaut Courtois called the performance “unacceptable”. But that didn’t tell the story either, even if it was true. It could have been more than four: Barcelona had 17 shots, missed a handful of one on ones and Courtois had made six saves. Barcelona were winning four-nil but were also furious, keen to impose a competitive culture, a relentlessness; aware that this was an opportunity to do something really, really silly. It was pretty silly anyway. Asked to define it, Xavi said: “I’ll let you, the media, do that,” and so they did. Sport’s cover simply said: “Marvellous!!” The former Barça striker Pichi Alonso declared it “right up there with the 0-5 and the 2-6”. Mundo Deportivo declared it a “meneo”: they had given Madrid the runaround. It was, as Santi Giménez put it in AS, a señor baño: not a men’s toilet, although you can insert your own joke here, but a “bath”. A kicking, a drubbing, a destruction. After the game the centre back, Eric García, admitted the players couldn’t believe their eyes in the first half, that’s how good they had been. And yet, it was more even than the quality of the football, the feeling of superiority, the tactical, or the quiet that came over the Bernabéu; it was the way it linked to those other games, the symbolism, the identity. The moment. It was who, what and where but it was when too. Which is why there is another Bernabéu victory where parallels might be sought. In 2004, Barcelona beat Madrid 2-1. That day, Xavi scored the winner. It was too late for them to win the league that season – they did actually overhaul a collapsing Madrid, but Valencia took the title – yet it reaffirmed their revival in the second half of the season and set them up to win the league the following season, and the season after that. The confirmation they could compete, an identity forming, a path laid before them. Much like now, or at least that’s how this felt, however fleeting that might ultimately prove. “We needed this,” Xavi said. It was four months to the day since he took charge of his first game, at a time of crisis for the club. In his first clásico, in the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia, he had taken comfort in defeat, convinced that something was building. That drew a lot of laughs from a lot of folk, but strengthen by the arrival of Dani Alves, Ferran Torres, Adama Traoré and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang arriving in the winter window, with Pedri fit again, and with Dembélé rehabilitated at least for now, Barcelona have lost just once since then, to Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey. They came into Sunday’s clásico unbeaten in 11, having scored four goals five times in that period. Still, this was supposed to be different, a proper test of how good they actually are, whether the revival is real. “We come from a period when we couldn’t win,” Busquets said. After five consecutive clásico defeats, Barcelona didn’t just win, they won like this. A coach with less than half a year’s European experience had taken apart Ancelotti’s side, better than them “in every respect”, as Nacho put it. Xavi, the papers agreed, had got his PhD at the Bernabéu, his team flying already. “Ay, if only you had come sooner,” Sport wrote. “The Xavi era begins,” claimed El Mundo. “Barcelona are back,” ran the headline in El País. Those are papers, you might say, and you’d be right. So here are the players. “We are back,” Gerard Piqué wrote immediately after the final whistle. Not back in the title race, just back. “We are very far from winning the league but, OK, we need to believe: this is the way. We showed everybody that we are coming back,” Xavi insisted. “I think it’s the beginning of a new era for Barcelona and it’s great for the club,” said Aubameyang, who had coolly clipped in the fourth, ran behind the goal, collected a red ball passed to him by a friend in the front row and posed like Son Goku from Dragon Ball, the Japanese manga and anime adventures. “When you have the ball you can dream and I dreamed of winning and scoring,” he explained after, later tweeting a picture of the celebration and the line: “Hello from the finished player.” Alavés 2-3 Granada, Athletic Bilbao 1-1 Getafe, Cadiz 1-0 Villarreal, Celta Vigo 0-0 Real Betis, Elche 0-1 Valencia,  Espanyol 1-0 Mallorca, Osasuna 3-1 Levante, Rayo Vallecano 0-1 Atlético Madrid, Real Madrid 0-4 Barcelona, Sevilla 0-0 Real Sociedad There was a gorgeous assist too. “Ferran called me, I said: Ok, I think he is alone,’” Aubameyang said, a smile taking over his entire face. “In the beginning I was going to shoot but when I hear him, I think he is better placed than me.” That’s nine goals in 11 games since he arrived. “To tell the truth I was expecting to do something good,” he said, “but it’s definitely going even better than I expected.” That goes for all of them, bounding around the dressing room chanting: “Being Barcelona is the best thing there is.” For a while, it didn’t look that way; maybe now it can be, and earlier than anyone expected. “We dream a lot and dreaming is free,” Alves insisted. If, that is, they could sleep at all. The crisis remains real at the club, but something is shifting and this was a moment that will always be there, “something to enjoy” as Xavi put it. “Beyond being the manager, I’m a culé[fan of the club]. We haven’t been winning many titles recently so this is a moment to celebrate, of course,” he said. Outside, Laporta was waiting: he had been looking forward to seeing this place again and he wasn’t planning on going anywhere just yet. Xavi and his staff headed back out to the pitch to take a picture of themselves on a familiar stage where they hoped a new era had just begun.",Sport/Football,Xavi’s Barça hope clásico moment at the Bernabéu heralds new beginning | Sid Lowe,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/21/xavi-barcelona-hope-clasico-moment-bernabeu-real-madrid-heralds-new-beginning-la-liga

All three French musketeers were outstanding, but my vote goes to the classy Fickou, who has matured into the most complete centre in the world. Robert Kitson Grégory Alldritt (France). A colossal performance against England to crown a stunning championship for France’s No 8. Honourable mentions for Gaël Fickou and Hugo Keenan. Gerard Meagher Antoine Dupont (France). Judging by the numbers, you’d give it to Grégory Alldritt, but Dupont is the captain and talisman of the French team, and the one player they would miss the most if he was injured. Andy Bull Cyril Baille (France). This was the Six Nations of the loose-head. Can’t believe people aren’t talking about that. Cyril Baille’s off-loading and support play give him the edge over a host of thrusting No 1s. Michael Aylwin Grégory Alldritt (France). Could have been any of half a dozen Frenchmen, but Alldritt’s all-round game – carrying, offloading, tackling, breakdown work – was the driving force behind a first grand slam since 2010. Jonathan Liew Antoine Dupont (France). Ruthless in attack, relentless in defence. A joy to watch and a nightmare to play against. The fulcrum of France’s grand slam is a player you’ll bore your grandchildren about. Luke McLaughlin France 30-24 Ireland. A cut above the rest in terms of quality. Ireland threw everything at France, who soaked it up and edged their way to victory. Some atmosphere, squeezed into a Scottish pub in the centre of Rome, too. GM France 30-24 Ireland. A genuine epic of the highest quality, and a handy rejoinder to those in the southern hemisphere who still deride the Six Nations as a parochial slap-around. JL The best from a pure rugby perspective was France v Ireland. Ultimately, though, the closing stages of Wales v Italy outshone all else. Poetry in motion, unless you were supporting Wales. RK Wales 9-13 France. It wasn’t perfect but it was endlessly tense. Despite being depleted by illness, France dug in, kept tackling, and stayed on course. Every grand slam needs a win like this. LM The standard of play in France’s win over Ireland was a couple of levels above anything else in the tournament, and worthy of a World Cup final. AB Favourite or best? If we are judging by quality and significance, then France-Ireland, although Ireland did make a lot of mistakes. But to hell with all that: Wales-Italy. MA Italy’s last-minute try against Wales was what sport is all about: drama, splendour, guts, redemption. And in the magnificent Ange Capuozzo, perhaps even the birth of a new star. JL Slightly corny, maybe, but all the pre-match anthems after two Covid-ravaged years. The atmosphere in the Stade de France on Saturday night was off the charts before the game even started. RK Hard to look beyond Ange Capuozzo’s break that twisted Josh Adams’ blood and gave Italy a win at long last. Did enjoy Antoine Dupont scragging Maro Itoje, who had stepped in at scrum-half, too. GM Paolo Garbisi’s Cardiff conversion that sealed Italy’s first Six Nations win since 2015. Have you ever seen a fly-half collapse, an emotional wreck, after slotting such a straightforward kick? Magical. LM Capuozzo! That break against Wales in the penultimate minute made one of the great tries in the history of the championship. AB Er, let me think. Away wins are quite rare in the Six Nations and there was a moment when, for only the third time, a fourth consecutive away win was recorded. Really quite uplifting it was too as Italy celebrated. MA The way Scotland fell away after beating England. I never thought they’d win the tournament, but I’ve no idea how they ended up in such a mess six weeks later. AB England’s Jack Nowell saying: “The way we train, we always mix in together. You never have the same centres together, you never have the same back three.” That explains a lot. LM Why is rugby union still in such a muddle when it comes to head injury protocols? Wales’s Tomas Francis should have been permanently removed at Twickenham and the stand-down period for concussed players needs to be increased. RK That there was any doubt there would be a grand slam this year. After two years without one, we returned to the usual balance for the Six Nations of more grand-slam years than not. MA The manner in which Scotland unravelled after beating England. There have been false dawns before, but they were supposed to have taken the next step. Clearly not. And Italy winning a match, of course. GM Taine Basham. The 22-year-old Wales flanker began the tournament as one of its potential breakout stars and ended it by being dropped. Will come back stronger for the experience. JL … supporters at stadiums kept considerably more informed over key refereeing decisions. Let them hear Mathieu Raynal’s clear and concise explanation for Charlie Ewels’s red card on the PA, or precisely why Italy had to go down to 13 men. It shouldn’t be too much to ask; they pay enough to be there, after all. GM … more of Ange Capuozzo. And Marcus Smith. And Michael Lowry. And Darcy Graham.

3/22/2022,"Seafarers from abroad brought in to replace the 800 sacked British P&O Ferries crew are being paid as little as £1.80 an hour, according to unions. The RMT union, which represents many of the staff who were abruptly fired last week by the Dubai-owned company, said Indian ratings brought in by offshore agencies to operate on the Dover-Calais route were being paid $2.38. It is understood that P&O Ferries disputes the figures, but it declined to discuss the rates or give alternative rates as the crew are employed by a third-party agency. The RMT general secretary, Mick Lynch, said it was “a shocking exploitation of those seafarers and another gut-wrenching betrayal of those who have been sacked”. He called for sailings to be halted amid safety concerns over the wholesale replacement of P&O’s long-serving crew with fresh officers and ratings. Lynch said: “The rule of law and acceptable norms of decent employment and behaviour have completely broken down beneath the white cliffs of Dover and in other ports, yet five days into this national crisis the government has done nothing to stop it. The government has to step in now and take control before it’s too late.” A P&O Ferries spokesperson said the company had recruited “high-quality experienced seafarers, who will now familiarise themselves with the ships, going through all mandatory training requirements set out by our regulators.” He added: “Safety is paramount in our new crewing management model.” The standard minimum wage in Britain is £8.91 an hour. However, it is understood that maritime operators are not liable to UK regulation when they are sailing internationally and are flagged outside the UK. After Brexit, P&O Ferries reflagged some of its UK-registered ships to locations including Cyprus. Seafarers’ wages in general are driven down by firms recruiting from agencies abroad to work on sailings out of UK ports. Although the scales are kept confidential, a Guardian investigation in 2012 found that P&O Cruises – a wholly separate firm – was paying crew a basic wage of 75p an hour. An update to the rules to ensure minimum wages are applied on ships for all nationalities of workers sailing between UK ports was brought in last year by the government, which would appear to mean P&O Ferries would have to pay the minimum wage to workers brought in on the Larne-Cairnryan route. However, cross-Channel ferries are exempt. P&O would not confirm whether it paid the minimum wage. No passenger sailings have operated since P&O Ferries made its shock announcement on Thursday, telling staff – many by video message – that they were being replaced immediately by cheaper agency crew. P&O said services would remain suspended for several more days. Protests were held on Monday afternoon outside the offices of DP World, P&O Ferries’ owner, and at parliament. Unions said DP World was treating workers with contempt after refusing to meet ‎the heads of the RMT, Nautilus and the TUC, who were attending the protest at its headquarters. Labour will force an emergency vote in the Commons on Monday demanding that the government outlaws “fire and rehire” practices, where firms make workers redundant and offer the same job on worse terms and conditions. Labour will also demand that state contracts with DP World are suspended. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said: “What I want to see is those workers reinstated to their jobs. What I don’t want to hear is government ministers complaining about what P&O have done. Now they’ve got the chance to do something about it, vote this afternoon for reinstatement and banning fire and rehire.”",News/Business,"Replacements for P&O Ferries crew paid £1.80 an hour, unions say",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/21/replacements-for-po-ferries-crew-paid-180-an-hour-unions-say
3/22/2022,"A five-year-old boy who was allegedly murdered by his mother, her partner and a teenager suffered brain trauma, damage to internal organs, internal bleeding and bruising from head to foot, a jury has heard. A pathologist said that some of injuries suffered by Logan Mwangi before his death were so severe that they would have been expected in someone who had been in a road accident or had fallen from a height, while some were days or weeks old. The court was also told that one particular type of injury to Logan’s abdomen was rare in children but had been found in abused youngsters. Logan’s mother, Angharad Williamson, 30, his stepfather, John Cole, 40, and a 14-year-old boy who cannot be identified for legal reasons, deny murdering the boy, who was found in a river near his home in the village of Sarn in south Wales on 31 July last year. As the hearing began on Monday, Caroline Rees QC, prosecuting, warned the jury at Cardiff crown court that they might find the evidence distressing. Pathologist John Williams, who carried out a post mortem on Logan, said the boy was 3ft 5ins tall and weighed just over three stone. As Williamson sobbed in the dock, he told the jury he had identified 56 locations on Logan’s face, head, trunk, arms, legs, hands and feet where he had seen bruises, grazes, scratches or other marks. Some of the locations had more than one damaged area. Williams said Logan suffered “deep scalp bruising” to the back of his head consistent with “blunt force head injury”. He said at least part of Logan’s head injury could have been suffered at least 36-40 hours before his death. The pathologist said there was also evidence of “severe blunt force” injury to the abdomen including a tear to the liver and Logan had suffered bowel damage. Williams said the type of abdominal injuries Logan had suffered were rare in children and found in victims of road crashes, falls from more than 10ft. He said an injury to the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine, had been recorded in abused children. He added: “The constellation of injuries focused on the right upper quadrant of the abdomen is indicative of severe localised blunt force injury” and said the injuries could have been caused by “a blow or blows, a kick or kicks or impact or impacts with a weapon”. The jury was told that Logan also had a broken collar bone, which showed signs of healing, though it was knitting together poorly. The pathologist said this injury was “at least several weeks old”. It is alleged all the three defendants were involved in murdering Logan before concocting a cover-up that included dumping his body in the river and phoning the police to falsely report him missing, Williamson and the teenager deny murder and perverting the course of justice, while Cole denies murder but admits the second charge.

3/22/2022,"A former Olympic swimmer has written a letter of protest to US college sports’ governing body, the NCAA, attacking its policy on transgender athletes after a high-profile swim meet that made international news. The University of Pennsylvania’s Lia Thomas made history on Thursday as the first known transgender athlete to win an NCAA swimming championship when she took the title in the 500m freestyle. Penn's Lia Thomas wins the NCAA championship in the 500 free, touching in a season-best 4:33.24: ""It means the world to be here, to be with two of my best friends and my teammates, and to be able to compete."" pic.twitter.com/7P2mO6Uyi3 USA Swimming’s policy states that trans athletes must undergo three years of hormone replacement therapy before being allowed to compete. Thomas is six months short of that target but the NCAA decided not to adopt USA Swimming’s rules and allowed the senior to compete in last week’s meet in Atlanta. Reka Gyorgy, who competed at the 2016 Olympics for Hungary and now swims for Virginia Tech, wrote a letter to the NCAA, objecting to Thomas’s participation. “This is my last college meet ever and I feel frustrated. It feels like that final spot was taken away from me because of the NCAA’s decision … I know you could say I had the opportunity to swim faster and make the top 16, but this situation makes it a bit different and I can’t help but be angry or sad. It hurts me, my team and other women in the pool,” she wrote. Save Women’s Sport, a group that opposes transgender athletes competing in women’s competition, staged protests outside Georgia Tech’s swimming facility, where Thomas competed last week. Her victory was greeted with cheers and a smattering of boos by fans poolside. But while Gyorgy and other swimmers have been critical of Thomas’s participation, other athletes have shown support. Texas’ Erica Sullivan, who finished third behind Thomas in the 500m freestyle, wrote an essay for Newsweek in which she argued women’s sports has other issues that are far more important to address. “As a woman in sports, I can tell you that I know what the real threats to women’s sports are: sexual abuse and harassment, unequal pay and resources and a lack of women in leadership. Transgender girls and women are nowhere on this list,” Sullivan wrote.",Sport/Sport,Lia Thomas’ victory at NCAA swimming finals sparks fierce debate over trans athletes,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/21/lia-thomas-victory-at-ncaa-swimming-finals-sparks-fierce-debate-over-trans-athletes
3/22/2022,"OneWeb, the satellite company part-owned by the British state, is turning to Elon Musk’s SpaceX for help after it was barred from using Russian rockets to launch its latest orbiters. Under the arrangement, the communications firm will partner with SpaceX for its first launches later this year, adding to the 428 micro-satellites it already has in low-earth orbit. OneWeb and SpaceX did not disclose the terms of the launch arrangement. The company quotes a standard price of $67m to launch a Falcon 9 rocket – up from $62m earlier this year, “to account for excessive levels of inflation”. The 12% increase is the first in nearly six years. OneWeb was forced to abandon its plans to launch on one of Russia’s Soyuz rockets earlier this month, after Dmitry Rogozin, the head of the Russian space agency, demanded the satellites not be used for military purposes and the British government halt its financial backing. The House of Commons business committee chair, Darren Jones, had said it was “inappropriate” for OneWeb to take off from a launchpad at the Russian-owned Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan after the invasion of Ukraine, given the UK government’s large stake in the business. “We thank SpaceX for their support, which reflects our shared vision for the boundless potential of space,” said OneWeb’s chief executive, Neil Masterson. “With these launch plans in place, we’re on track to finish building out our full fleet of satellites and deliver robust, fast, secure connectivity around the globe.” The UK government took a £400m stake in OneWeb in July 2020, investing to save the business from bankruptcy when it failed to secure funding in March that year to continue building out its planned fleet of 650 satellites. The investment came shortly after the UK was barred from accessing the EU’s Galileo satellite navigation system due to Brexit. The government initially tried to argue that the stake would allow it to build a British alternative – a plan experts dismissed, since OneWeb’s communication satellites are radically different from those required for a navigation system. “We’ve bought the wrong satellites,” Dr Bleddyn Bowen, a space policy expert at the University of Leicester, said at the time. The new launch arrangement carries its own awkward baggage: SpaceX and OneWeb are direct competitors, each aiming to offer a global satellite broadband network that can offer high-speed internet connections anywhere in the world. SpaceX’s service, Starlink, is provided by a fleet of 2,112 satellites in orbit.",News/Science,UK-backed OneWeb to use rival SpaceX rockets after Russian ban,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/21/uk-backed-oneweb-to-use-rival-spacex-rockets-after-russian-ban
3/22/2022,"The Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, has played a key role in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. He has allowed Russian convoys and troops to close in on Kyiv from Belarusian territory and provided military infrastructure, notably airbases that Russian warplanes are using to attack Ukraine. The country is being bombarded by rockets arriving from Belarusian territory. Belarus’s dictator also provides political support for Russian aggression: Belarus voted against the resolution of the UN general assembly condemning the Russian invasion (alongside Russia, Syria, North Korea and Eritrea), and its state propaganda machine mirrors Russia’s in its justifications. Like its eastern neighbour, the Lukashenko regime is arresting and repressing those who dare protest against war. Lukashenko continues to deny that Belarusian troops could be used in Russia’s invasion, although this could change in response to pressure from the Kremlin if Russia requires more support to police occupied Ukrainian territory or revitalise its stymied assaults. The Kremlin’s potential use of the Belarusian army hinges on the extent to which Lukashenko has enough agency to make independent decisions. Belarus’s participation indicates that his independence is limited, as Minsk will pay a colossal price for its involvement – a price that an independent politician would never accept for their country. It seems likely that Lukashenko was obliged to assist Putin after the Russian government rescued him in 2020: he was only able to remain in power thanks to massive repression and the Kremlin’s support, despite having lost the presidential election. The Lukashenko regime probably understands that direct involvement in the war will lead to even more severe western sanctions and international isolation. This means Belarus will only be able to develop political and economic ties with Russia, which will then be able to dictate its own terms. Therefore, the regime is at least attempting to refrain from full engagement in the war. The west views Lukashenko as a co-aggressor, and the sanctions imposed on Russia are partially being applied to Belarus as well. A significant portion of Belarusian exports to western countries, including petroleum products, are now subject to an embargo. Adding to this burden, many enterprises are under sanction and have lost market confidence, a large proportion of Belarusian IT workers and western companies have already left, logistics chains have been ruptured and the Belarusian rouble is rapidly devaluing. An economic crisis has already begun, and it remains to be seen whether the Kremlin will allocate funds to Minsk in order to mitigate the fallout. Although sanctions are less severe – as Belarus is perceived as an accomplice rather than an initiator – they are nevertheless unprecedented. However, sanctions against Minsk will need to be aligned with those imposed on Moscow in order to prevent Russian companies from circumventing them via Belarus. Sociological research conducted by Chatham House last month indicated that most Belarusians do not want their country to participate in this war, and they believe that Belarusian involvement will have catastrophic ramifications. At the same time, Belarusians can be divided into two groups based on whom they support. The first group gets most of its information from state television, and supports Russia. The second group receives news from the independent media, and supports Ukraine. The first backs Lukashenko, the second opposes him. About 1,000 Belarusians have already been arrested for peacefully protesting; others are sabotaging infrastructure used by the Russian military. Hundreds more are joining volunteer detachments of the Ukrainian army. Despite their divisions over Russia itself, however, most Belarusians are united in their objection to the war into which Lukashenko has dragged them. Whether they can make their voices heard or will be silenced again remains to be seen.
