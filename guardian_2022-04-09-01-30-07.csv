4/9/2022,"Former Goldman Sachs executive Roger Ng has been found guilty of helping to steal billions of dollars from Malaysia’s 1MDB sovereign wealth fund after a lengthy trial brought by US prosecutors, who described the fraud as one the largest financial scandals in history and who hoped to show that individuals are always at the center of corporate wrongdoing. A New York jury found Ng, 49, once Goldman’s top investment banker in Malaysia, guilty of helping his former boss Tim Leissner embezzle money intended for development to benefit Malaysia’s poor from a fund connected to Malaysia’s then prime minister, Najib Razak, and then to launder the proceeds while bribing officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi. Ng had pleaded not guilty to conspiracy and money-laundering under US foreign anti-corruption laws. Ng’s lawyers had claimed that Leissner, a co-operating government witness who pleaded guilty to similar charges in 2018, had falsely implicated him. The charges against both men stemmed from a scheme in which Goldman helped 1MDB raise $6.5bn through three bond sales. But $4.5bn was diverted to government officials, bankers and their associates between 2009 and 2015. The funds were used, in part, to fund the lavish lifestyle of the fugitive Malaysian playboy Jho Low, who embarked on an eye-popping spending spree, including luxury apartments, yachts, impressionist artworks and film projects including Martin Scorsese’s The Wolf of Wall Street. Ng is the first and likely only person to face trial in the United States over the scheme. Goldman in 2020 paid nearly $3bn in fines, and its Malaysian unit agreed to plead guilty. During the trial, Leissner testified for nine days as defense lawyers questioned his credibility, and drew attention to claims that he was married to two different women when he married Kimora Lee Simmons, the model, reality TV star and Baby Phat designer, in 2014. “Tim Leissner uses people,” Ng’s defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo told jurors last month. He was “married to two different women at the same time, twice” and had an “illicit” relationship with another, Agnifilo said in opening statements. Agnifilo said in closing arguments that Leissner could not be trusted. But jurors rejected that argument and sided with prosecutors. The verdict represents a win for the US Department of Justice, which has been looking to hold individuals responsible for crimes conducted under a corporate cloak, in this case Goldman Sachs. Those principles were set out in a 2015 memo by then deputy US attorney general, Sally Yates, who that stated “a corporation only acts through individuals, investigating the conduct of individuals is the most efficient and effective way to determine the facts and extent of any corporate misconduct”. The memo was updated in 2020 with a set of principles, that argued individual accountability “deters future illegal activity, incentivizes changes in corporate behavior, ensures that the proper parties are held responsible for their actions, and promotes the public’s confidence in our justice system”.",News/World news,Ex-Goldman banker Roger Ng found guilty in billion-dollar 1MDB scandal,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/08/roger-ng-1mdb-scandal-fraud-found-guilty
4/9/2022,"My friend Ruth Bidgood, who has died aged 99, was one of the finest Welsh poets in English and one of the best British female poets of her generation. She was also a local historian who patiently recorded the hidden history of the Black Mountains and mid-Wales. She was born in Seven Sisters, near Neath, the daughter of the Rev Herbert Jones and his English wife, Hilda (nee Garrett), an elementary school teacher, and educated at Port Talbot secondary school and St Hugh’s College, Oxford. In 1943 she joined the Women’s Royal Naval Service (the Wrens) and worked in Alexandria, Egypt, as a coder, a job she later said was “akin to writing poetry” – that is, searching for the right and precise word. But like so many female poets, she was a late starter. She married David Bidgood in 1946, had three children and lived mainly in Coulsdon, Surrey, although in the mid-60s the family bought a bungalow at Abergwesyn, in a beautiful north Breconshire valley, for summer holidays. “The call of the land and the ruins” inspired her to start writing poetry and investigating the past. Making up for lost time, she published several poems in magazines and a first collection, The Given Time, in 1972. But soon afterwards her husband left her, and the “corrugated iron cottage” miles from anywhere became her permanent home. She didn’t drive and led a very quiet, though not reclusive, life for the rest of her days. Fourteen volumes of poetry followed; she continued writing well into her 90s. Her great subject was the “green desert” of mid-Wales, the harsh landscape, standing stones, crumbling churches, neglected gravestones and abandoned slate mines. It was inexhaustible. Her “rush-ridden valley” was not pretty but something that could swallow “the bones of your life”. The stories of vanished people “who lived here and are not remembered” were reconstructed in her poetry and in more than 70 scholarly articles. She was elected a fellow of the Welsh Academy and an honorary fellow of Aberystwyth University. Ruth’s daughter, Janet, died in 2007. She is survived by her sons, Tony and Martin, eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.",Arts/Books,Ruth Bidgood obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/08/ruth-bidgood-obituary
4/9/2022,"I felt great affinity with Rafael Behr’s article (‘Homes for Ukraine’ is just a slogan – as I found out by trying to welcome a refugee, 5 April). Another day has passed, and still no news on our visa application for a family in desperate need. My family are ready to give them safety and peace for as long as they need it. We have been ready since the day that we applied through the Homes for Ukraine scheme. While the press and public remain stunned into paralysis by the shocking reports from Bucha, we must surely also continue to draw attention to the need for active, immediate help for current survivors. We must recognise that even those who have crossed the Ukrainian border have access to these press images – this is ongoing, real-time, cumulative trauma that requires real-time intervention. Our own sponsees pack themselves and their children on to overcrowded trains across Europe and head through the night as I type, to destinations unknown. I have friends whose sponsees are currently in Ukraine. They are being bombed now. Today. All sponsors like us are receiving frightened messages several times daily from our potential wards, creating stress and trauma in our own community too. This hollow “process” has set British families up to take responsibility for an extraordinary amount of negotiation, paperwork and counsel, for which our only qualification, in most cases, is being compassionate human beings. Ours is the only European government to have such a series of hurdles in place for these people fleeing the outrageous assault on Ukraine. For their sake, and ours, we must resolve this bizarre insistence on paper-shuffling, and act.Kate WilliamsLeamington Spa, Warwickshire  Rafael Behr was well justified in scarifying Whitehall obstruction to the Homes for Ukraine programme. In November 1956, I watched refugees from the Hungarian uprising being welcomed by Welsh family hosts as they climbed down from the train. Some still wore blood-stained bandages. This was because they had come straight from the Austrian frontier, admitted by the British government without visas, security checks or any pre-entry paperwork. Older refugees will remember Women’s Voluntary Service and Red Cross volunteers marching into the Austrian reception camps and shouting: “Anyone want to come to Britain? Line up behind me!” Then it was into the buses, on to the airfield, and on to Britain within a few hours. Selwyn Lloyd, then foreign secretary, told the Commons as the first contingent arrived: “Perhaps our most important contribution has been to allow 11,500 refugees to enter this country without preliminary examination. This is a greater number than any other country except Austria has been able to take.” Many more would follow, in those more generous days.Neal AschersonLondon  My son is British and is a teacher in Finland. He was very concerned at the plight of the population of Ukraine following Russia’s invasion at the end of February and felt he should do something about it. He arranged crowdfunding, contacted three colleagues, one of whom spoke Russian, rented two large vans and drove to the Polish border a couple of weeks ago. There he contacted a reception centre, and the party were allocated eight refugees, two of them disabled. They drove back to Finland, travelling through three countries during their journey – Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia – and crossed the Gulf of Finland to arrive in Helsinki. Accommodation was arranged in Helsinki without problem. There were no visas required and the refugees were welcomed in all four countries. One of the Ukrainians had a cat; as it could not be proved that the pet had had adequate vaccinations, there was a delay, but this was eventually resolved. The successful rescue was a great relief to those fleeing the violence, and they were profusely grateful. If my son had set out from Britain on a similar mission, what do we think would be the chances of a favourable result?Stephen TyrerNewcastle upon Tyne  We have been hosting a mother and her nine-year-old son from Ukraine since 17 March. They have come to the UK on a family scheme visa through her husband, who lives in local shared accommodation and has nowhere to put them as of now. The husband has been working in the area for years in construction and brought his family here after the war started. He was looking for a place for them to stay and we took them immediately when asked. However, to my dismay, I just learned that because they arrived through the family scheme, they do not qualify for any support from the government, nor do we qualify as their hosts for the government’s monthly £350 payment either. The majority of people who are coming here through family schemes have nowhere to stay as their family members often work here seasonally and live in shared accommodation. The government should include all the Ukrainian refugees from the family scheme in the Homes for Ukraine programme, otherwise there will be many homeless, desperate refugees from a horrific war who have nowhere to go. When I called our local council, they were not able to help at all other than suggest that our guests register as homeless and we evict them. They said that this is the only way for them to find long-term accommodation as there is almost nothing on the rental market. I find it absolutely horrific and sad that this is all that the UK can offer these refugees.Name and address supplied  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

4/9/2022,"As a lifelong friend of the Russian Orthodox Church, well aware of its profound spiritual gifts to world Christendom, let me thank you for your forthright editorial (3 April) chastising the Moscow patriarch for embracing the heresy of ethno-nationalist militarism. Western churches, too, have not been immune to that temptation. By making Putin’s war a “holy war”, the patriarch has betrayed the Christian faith and taken his church back to the darkest of tsarist times. Leo Tolstoy, for one, knew when to turn his back. Holy Russia is represented today by courageous protesting priests and people, light years away from the pompous military cathedral that Patriarch Kirill recently consecrated with the new would-be tsar at his side. That is blasphemy. I pray for the day when Kyiv, the birthplace of Holy Rus, can again live at peace with Moscow and be welcomed into fellowship with the churches of the west. Given my experience as an emissary of the British churches in eastern Europe through the years of the cold war, I believe that a negotiated peace settlement, embracing both Russia and Ukraine, would begin to make possible the rebuilding of security and trust.

4/9/2022,"I was intrigued by your article (Teachers encouraged to use Taylor Swift lyrics to make Latin accessible, 7 April). My experience of being taught New Testament Greek in the mid-80s relied on a knowledge of current affairs. Our teacher, the brilliant Prof Michael Goulder from Birmingham University, used to present us with a piece to translate each week, written in his own fair hand. This might be a biblical piece, a piece from ancient Greek material, or a contemporary news story. At the time we were in the middle of the miners’ strike and I quickly learned to search for “Arthur” in the text as that was a clear indicator it was neither biblical nor ancient. It was a brilliant way to teach us the language as well as ensuring we kept up to date on the news.Dr Fiona ThompsonShipley, West Yorkshire  In the 1960s, in an effort to make our Latin lessons more fun, our very charismatic teacher, Mrs Howard, gave us the task of translating popular songs into Latin; Cliff Richard’s The Young Ones was relatively straightforward, rather more challenging was The Kinks’ Dedicated Follower of Fashion, in particular the line “and when he pulls his frilly nylon panties right up tight”. It worked! We had a lot of fun and, against all odds, I managed to pass O-level Latin.Deborah LaceOrmskirk, Lancashire  Your article on making Latin accessible took me back about 60 years.

In the 1970s, I was part of the small team in the Department of Health and Social Security responsible for policy on sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Part of my job was to reply to letters. They could be very wide-ranging, and we devised a stock reply, basically telling the correspondent where they could find information on STDs and, if need be, treatment. Mary Whitehouse was a constant correspondent – a pain in the neck, frankly. She wrote to the secretary of state for health and social security, in her usual high dudgeon, having heard about a “new” disease, herpes genitalis. The letter was delegated to me, so I sent her the stock reply: “Dear Mrs Whitehouse, Thank you for your recent letter about herpes genitalis. The information you seek can be found in Dr Robbie Morton’s The Venereal Diseases, available through your local library.

4/9/2022,"Liberty Steel has announced plans to cut 200 jobs in the UK at plants in South Yorkshire and the West Midlands, in the latest sign of the struggles facing the industrialist Sanjeev Gupta’s metals group. The company said on Friday that it would cut 160 jobs at a plant in Stocksbridge, South Yorkshire, and 45 in West Bromwich in the West Midlands as it focused production on another plant in Rotherham, also in South Yorkshire. The two affected plants make specialised alloys for customers in aerospace and energy. Liberty Steel and other parts of Gupta’s GFG Alliance metals businesses have been under financial pressure for a year since the collapse in March 2021 of their main backer, Greensill Capital. GFG says it employ 35,000 people worldwide in its group of mines, steel and aluminium plants, and an energy company. Liberty Steel’s UK operations have also been threatened directly. In February HM Revenue and Customs filed winding up petitions against four companies employing 3,000 workers, including those operating the Stocksbridge and West Bromwich sites, over unpaid tax. HMRC withdrew the petitions last month after negotiations. GFG has tried to restructure its complex web of UK operations and find new financiers to invest, although it has not so far announced any significant external backers. It is also facing an investigation by the UK’s Serious Fraud Office, and the French government has evidence that GFG companies have “misappropriated” funds from a steel plant in Romania, according to court documents in a case involving one of the metal magnate’s companies. Gupta is listed as a director on 77 active UK companies. Accounts for 29 of those are overdue, nine of them by more than a year. Not filing an annual report is a criminal offence, although the maximum financial penalty for late filing is only £1,500 for a private company. It is generally seen as a red flag for other companies carrying out due diligence. Liberty said its restructuring of the special alloys business would “enhance their productivity and competitiveness ahead of a possible sale or partnership”. Alun Davies, national officer for Community, a union representing steelworkers, said the restructuring announcement “provides some much-needed clarity on the company’s intentions”. He added that the union believed Liberty Steel’s restructuring plans were “credible”, but would fight against mandatory redundancies, and that the company should ensure jobs were secure in the supply chain if it moved forward with the sale. In a written statement, Jeffrey Kabel, Liberty Steel Group’s chief transformation officer, did not address the redundancies but said the plants were “high-potential businesses”. He said: “The steps we’re announcing today will help ensure they are competitive in the future, with job creation at our Rotherham plant enabling us to mitigate a large percentage of role reductions at other sites.”",News/Business,Liberty Steel to cut 200 jobs in South Yorkshire and West Midlands,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/08/liberty-steel-jobs-cut-south-yorkshire-west-midlands
4/9/2022,"The author and illustrator David McKee, who has died aged 87, created some of the most loved and admired children’s picture books of the past 40 years, including Mr Benn, King Rollo and Not Now, Bernard. He was best known for his stories about Elmer the Patchwork Elephant, who loves to play practical jokes and longs to fit in. Inspired by the mascot of the Bordeaux zoo, McKee’s first story about Elmer was published in 1968. It was not immediately obvious that it would become such a huge success, but McKee added a second title, Elmer Again and Again (1975), and then gradually more over the years – there are now dozens of Elmer books, which have been translated into more than 60 languages, and lines of branded clothing and toys. As Elmer’s popularity increased, McKee kept a firm grip on how the patchwork elephant could be adapted to other media. His unusual wish not to pursue the highest commercial gain, combined with his modesty and lack of pretension, ensured Elmer’s status as a “national treasure” never threatened to overshadow his other books. McKee continued to love writing about Elmer because he enjoyed the response he got to the elephant’s warm-hearted message of inclusivity. He also felt close to him as a character. He said: “I know him very well and I enjoy the stories he tells me. In terms of publishing he has snowballed but I have never felt that he has been taken away from me.” From the start of his career McKee was experimental in his storytelling and in how he used his illustrations. In all of his books there were certain common strands: there was a seamless bond between the words and pictures; they were witty in a deeply satisfying way; and they had underlying values of kindness, equality and pacificism, which were quietly stated and never imposed. The Elmer books had obvious child appeal. Other characters, including Mr Benn and King Rollo, although definitely adults, had exciting adventures and a certain kind of power that engaged children. The first Mr Benn story, Red Knight, was published in 1967, and its follow-ups became the basis of a BBC series, written and animated by McKee, that was broadcast in 1971-72 and frequently repeated over the years. In each episode, Mr Benn, a bowler-hatted office worker living in a cosy but rather dull suburban setting, leaves his home in Festive Road, London (based on Festing Road, Putney, where McKee once lived), and visits a fancy-dress shop. He tries on a costume, leaves via a magic door and goes on a gentle adventure – usually with a moral – suggested by the costume. In settings such as forests or jungles, he meets all kinds of people and animals, real or imaginary, before returning to his own world at the close of the tale. King Rollo also inspired an animated series, and in 1979 McKee set up the company King Rollo Films. Elmer’s adventures were broadcast as part of the Anytime Tales series in 1991. The son of Violet (nee Easton) and Richard McKee, David was born in Tavistock, Devon, and, after leaving Tavistock grammar school, studied at Plymouth College of Art, and then Hornsey College of Art in London. His early published work as a freelance illustrator consisted of humorous sketches for publications including Punch and the Reader’s Digest. His career as a book illustrator was launched in 1964, with Bronto’s Wings and Two Can Toucan, published by a small, independent publishing company, Abelard-Schuman, that was willing to take risks. There McKee worked with Klaus Flugge, who championed his books. When Flugge set up Andersen Press in 1976 it was obvious that McKee would move with him. Becoming great friends, the two worked together for the rest of McKee’s career. In all his books, McKee was on the side of the child, frequently providing subversive messages for them to find in the illustrations. He never talked down to children in his stories and never spelled out the point of them. Not Now, Bernard (1980), which tells of the consequences of parents being too busy to listen to their children, is one of the most dramatic picture books of all time and one that is most open to interpretation by the reader. Less challenging but equally powerful is Two Monsters (1985), the story of monsters living on different sides of a mountain who talk to each other but never meet until, after a fierce argument, they destroy the mountain and, for the first time, stand together and see the world in the same way. In addition to his own books, McKee illustrated books by other authors, including several of Michael Bond’s Paddington Bear stories. He was surprisingly overlooked in terms of awards. Although a convivial companion, he was relatively shy and modest, and appears not to have felt slighted by this, but he was delighted to be presented with the BookTrust lifetime achievement award in 2020: “The shock is hard to get over, and … even though I still don’t really believe it, I’m accepting it anyway, with great pleasure.” He had recently finished the latest Elmer title, Elmer and the Gift, which is due to be published in September. He is survived by his partner, Bakhta, and by three children, Chuck, Brett and Chantal, from his marriage to Barbara Ennuss, which ended in divorce.

4/9/2022,"Pep Guardiola believes Liverpool are the greatest opponents of his career and has compared Manchester City’s rivalry with Jürgen Klopp’s side to some of sport’s greatest ever, including Ali-Frazier and Nadal-Federer-Djokovic, as the two teams prepare to face off on Sunday in their Premier League title showdown. City host Jürgen Klopp’s side with the champions now just a point ahead of the challengers. In the past four seasons the title has been claimed by the two clubs – City winning three and Liverpool one. Guardiola was asked how long the rivalry can continue and if it was comparable to that of the heavyweight boxers, Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier, in the 1970s, and of tennis players Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer in the last two decades. “Yeah – but Nadal, Federer and [Novak] Djokovic was 20 years and we are five years [as rivals],” he said. “Footballers run quicker and so to maintain success is more difficult than other sports. When I retire and watch and play golf I will remember the biggest rivalry was with Liverpool. When you achieve 100 points and 98 points [in two of City’s title-winning seasons] you need someone to push from behind to be so close. You have to make another step.” Guardiola added: “The most credit I give is for consistency through the years. Both City and Liverpool have had four or five years [at the top]. That’s why Federer, Nadal, Djokovic have been at the top for so long – consistency.” Having previously faced him while in charge of Borussia Dortmund, when Guardiola was at Bayern Munich, Klopp has more victories than any other manager against him but none since November 2019. Guardiola, who also managed Barcelona for four years, insisted that he has always thrived on rivalries. “Real Madrid made Barcelona better,” he said. “Dortmund with Jürgen and [then Thomas] Tuchel. Here, Man United and Chelsea change their managers but Liverpool and Jürgen have always been here.” Despite the high stakes of Sunday’s contest Guardiola will be particularly relaxed for it, joking about how the 4.30pm kick off potentially clashes with coverage of Tiger Woods playing in golf’s Masters. “I sleep like a baby this year,” the Catalan said. “I’m looking forward to Sunday … tomorrow [Saturday] would be better – I’m a little bit upset with the Premier League because they put the game when Tiger Woods is back.” Guardiola also aimed a good-humoured jibe at Klopp when asked if the German might be asked for a post-match drink. “If we win I’d love it – I’ll invite him,” he said. “Jürgen makes world football a better place to live. His message, and he’s a huge competitor. He knows, we spoke together in Germany, about my admiration for what he does, the message and the way his teams play. He’s a good guy and I don’t have any problems with him, absolutely not. And he’s said many times that we’re a rich club so the wine will be perfect, high quality.” Guardiola had earlier brushed off being described as the world’s best coach by Klopp. “I’m not, thank you so much, but I’m not,” he said. “I would like to tell him I’m the best, but I’m not. If we had success it is because of my staff, incredible teams, a lot of money – like our opponents like to hear – and a lot of work and talented players. Still I have the process of learning, and I became a manager to be on the pitch [only].” He was also asked about a report linking him with the Brazil job. “Not today, come on. I’m under contract here, I’m so happy here. I’m willing to stay forever here,” Guardiola said. “I’d extend the contract 10 years – I don’t know where it’s come from.” Despite Liverpool needing to win to top the table, City will not play for a draw. “To get 0-0, never, never in my life I thought about this,” he said.",Sport/Football,Guardiola rates Manchester City v Liverpool as ‘biggest rivalry’ of his career,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/08/manchester-citys-biggest-rivalry-is-with-liverpool-says-guardiola
4/9/2022,"Russia is heading for its deepest recession since the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union, the UK government predicted on Friday, as Moscow’s central bank unexpectedly cut its key interest rate to support its shrinking economy. The Foreign Office said Russia’s GDP is expected to contract by between 8.5% and 15% this year, as the series of sanctions imposed following the war in Ukraine hit activity. That would be more severe than in 2009, after the financial crisis, when Russia’s economy shrank around 7.8%, and would be the worst decline since GDP fell for several years in the early 1990s. Longer term, expert predictions suggest GDP growth will continue to be depressed as the country is cut off from western technology, the UK added, as it announced sanctions on Vladimir Putin’s two adult daughters. Western sanctions on Russia mean that about 60%, or £275bn, of its foreign exchange reserves are currently frozen, the UK added. That prevented Moscow making dollar debt repayments this week, putting it closer to defaulting on its debts. Russian firms have already reported a marked contraction in business activity in March, with output and new orders tumbling and inflationary pressures soaring. With a steep recession looming, the Bank of Russia has announced a surprise cut to borrowing costs. The Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR) will lower its key lending rate from 20% to 17% from Monday, six weeks after doubling interest rates in an emergency attempt to prop up the rouble. The cut shows the bank is pivoting its focus to support the economy, as the recent recovery in the rouble following the introduction of capital controls eased inflation worries. The CBR said inflationary pressures had softened, while financial stability risks had stabilised. It also cited the economic cost of sanctions, saying the external conditions remained challenging, and were “considerably constraining economic activity”. “Today’s decision reflects a change in the balance of risks of accelerated consumer price growth, decline in economic activity and financial stability risks,” said the CBR, adding that it could lower rates again at future policy meetings. The rate cut shows the CBR is “confident that the most acute phase of the economic crisis has now passed”, said Liam Peach, emerging Europe economist at Capital Economics, and that a major and destabilising bank run had been avoided. Peach predicts further gradual interest rate cuts over the course of this year, as the central bank attempts to bring inflation back to target. The rouble has recovered from the record lows in the early days of the Ukraine invasion, when it plunged to 135 roubles to the US dollar. It has now risen back to around 80 roubles to the dollar, helped by restrictions on moving money abroad and a ban on foreign currency sales. February’s interest rate rise also encouraged Russians to save their roubles, supporting the currency. The surge in commodity prices since the war began has also helped Russia’s finances, with Europe continuing to buy oil and gas to meet its energy needs. But the freeze on Russia’s foreign exchange reserves means Moscow is moving closer to its first debt default since 1998. Earlier this week, the US blocked attempts to pay more than $600m (£461m) owed to Russian bond investors, leading Moscow to make payments in roubles instead. That could be classed as a default, once a 30-day grace period expires. Several economists have forecast Russia could suffer a double-digit contraction this year. The Institute of International Finance predicted last month that Russia’s economy would shrink 15%, with the recession wiping out 15 years of economic gains by the end of 2023. Further energy boycotts would drastically impair Russia’s ability to import goods and services, deepening the recession, it warned. The London Platinum and Palladium Market announced on Friday it was suspending two Russian government-owned precious metals refineries from its good delivery lists with immediate effect. The decision bars the two refiners from selling platinum and palladium into the London market, the world’s largest. The palladium price jumped 8% after the move, on concerns of supply disruption to the precious metal used in catalytic converters.",News/World news,"Russia heading for worst recession since end of cold war, says UK",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/08/russia-heading-for-worst-recession-since-end-of-cold-war-says-uk
4/9/2022,"The Nobel peace prize-winning editor of the Russian independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta has said he was attacked on a train in Russia over Moscow’s war in Ukraine by an assailant who poured red paint on him. Dmitry Muratov said in a post to Telegram the incident happened on Thursday on a train heading from Moscow south-east to the city of Samara when the assailant shouted: “Muratov, here’s one for our boys.” He said his eyes were “burning terribly” after the assault and posted a selfie from the train toilet. Novaya Gazeta was one of the last major independent media outlets critical of Vladimir Putin’s government after others either shut or had their websites blocked following the invasion of Ukraine, but announced on 28 March it was suspending operations for the duration of the war after it received a second warning from the state censor, Roskomnadzor. It had earlier removed much of its war reporting from its website after Russia passed a law threatening jail terms of up to 15 years for information deemed by Russian authorities to be fake, as Muratov attempted to continue publishing Novaya Gazeta, reporting on the war and on the impact of sanctions, while obeying a directive that forbids journalists from describing the conflict as a war or invasion. The second warning came a day after Muratov spoke with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in a group interview with Russian journalists that Roskomnadzor quickly banned. Journalists from the paper this week announced the launch of Novaya Gazeta Europe, a new publication to be staffed by employees who have left Russia and will cover Russian affairs in different languages for domestic and international audiences. Its editor-in-chief, Kirill Martynov, told the Moscow Times it would be separate from Novaya Gazeta “both legally and in practice” and no one would work for both titles at the same time. “We, journalists of Novaya Gazeta who were forced to leave Russia due to a virtual ban on our profession, are happy to announce that Novaya Gazeta Europe, an outlet that shares our values and standards, is beginning its work,” Martynov said in a statement. Muratov’s account of the attack was posted to the Novaya Gazeta Europe Telegram channel. Novaya Gazeta was established in 1993 after the breakup of the Soviet Union and investigated corruption inside and outside Russia, as well as the long wars in Chechnya. Muratov, the paper’s longtime editor, shared the 2021 Nobel peace prize with Maria Ressa, a journalist from the Philippines. He dedicated his award to the memory of six of his paper’s journalists who were murdered for their work. In 2021 Novaya Gazeta said its offices in Moscow had been targeted in a chemical attack. The formal reasoning for why Novaya Gazeta was warned a second time remains unclear. Roskomnadzor told the state news agency Tass that the newspaper had failed to identify an unnamed non-governmental organisation as a “foreign agent” in its reporting, as required by Russian law, but did not specify the report in question. Fake news under Russia’s recently passed media law can include any mention of Russian forces harming civilians or suffering losses on the battlefield.",News/World news,Russian Nobel-winning editor says he was attacked with red paint,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/08/russian-nobel-winning-editor-dmitry-muratov-attacked-red-paint
4/9/2022,"The German government has buried its plans to introduce a coronavirus vaccine mandate after parliament rejected it, but says further restrictions may be inevitable to protect more vulnerable citizens. MPs voted against the draft bill on Thursday, which had it passed would have made it compulsory for over-60s to receive a vaccine, in what is seen as a humiliating defeat for the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, who has long been calling for the legislation. Originally the government’s plan had been for a widespread mandate to cover anyone over the age of 18. When that failed to attract enough support, it raised the age to over 50 and then to over 60. MPs rejected it by 378 to 296. The health minister, Karl Lauterbach, who has also been a firm backer of a mandate, arguing that Germany’s vaccination rate among older people is too low, said on Friday that he could not rule out the need to reintroduce restrictions such as mask wearing, especially in the autumn when the virus is expected to surge. About 76% of Germans are fully vaccinated, below the government’s target of 80%. Of particular concern are the 2 million – around 12% – of over-60s who are unvaccinated, a figure Lauterbach has repeatedly said is around three to four times higher in that age group than in other comparable countries such as the UK. A representative of German hospitals said on Friday that the daily rate of deaths from Covid-19 – which has been oscillating between around 200 and 300 for weeks – was “scarily high”, particularly when it was known that most of the deaths were likely to have been preventable. He said 80% of those being admitted to hospital with the virus were over 60, and the majority of deaths were of people who were unvaccinated. Lauterbach, a virologist who was a popular choice for health minister but has faced criticism for failing to project a positive message, said during a heated debate that he thought people had lost sight of the benefits brought by the vaccine. “If no one had been vaccinated, we would now have a perfect catastrophe and would be stuck in an all out lockdown. We must understand that,” he said. He questioned whether Germans really thought it was acceptable for the country to be facing several hundred mainly avoidable deaths every day for the foreseeable future. Sahra Wagenknecht of the far-left Die Linke party, said that as long as it was not known “how well the vaccine offers protection against future mutations” it was wrong of the government to make it mandatory. “Stop trying to patronise people,” she said, addressing Scholz. “The coronavirus vaccine must remain a personal decision.” The vote was considered so crucial to the government that Scholz recalled the foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, from a Nato meeting in Brussels to participate. Scholz confirmed after the debate that he believed, in contrast to Lauterbach, that the debate was dead in the water. “Parliament has spoken very clearly,” he said. “There is no legislative majority for a vaccine mandate,” he said. “This is the reality that we now need to take as the basis for our actions.” Lauterbach called the decision deeply regrettable. He has previously and repeatedly accused people who refuse a vaccination of “holding the rest of the country hostage”. At a recent election rally, Scholz urged people to get vaccinated. “Where’s the solidarity, when it’s of no concern to you whether you are infecting other people or not?” he said. “Freedom only functions when it means freedom for everyone.”",News/World news,German government drops plan for Covid vaccine mandate,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/08/german-government-drops-plan-for-covid-vaccine-mandate
4/9/2022,"The first point to remember when attempting to sift the Grand National winner from 40 possibilities is that it has never been about finding the best horse in the race. William Lynn, its founder, was an Aintree landlord who wanted to attract customers to his hotel, and created a steeplechase run over local fields and obstacles that guaranteed a decent payout for anyone who could find the winner. Nearly two centuries after Lottery – the 5-1 favourite – became the first horse to win, the National is more competitive than ever and luck, good and bad, always has a huge hand in the outcome. Minella Times and Any Second Now plotted similar routes through last year’s race until the 12th, where a faller brought Any Second Now to a standstill. Had Double Shuffle fallen in front of Minella Times instead, we would still be waiting for a first National victory by a female jockey. Rachael Blackmore’s instincts and skill also played a major part, and her remarkable ability to find the smoothest path to the line, even amid the bedlam of a Grand National, will be even more important on Saturday as she looks for a repeat success on Minella Times from a 15lb higher mark. The form of last year’s race, however, strongly suggests that Any Second Now is a much likelier winner, and with any luck in running, it is hard to see him finishing outside the top four. The form of his narrow defeat of Escaria Ten last time also looks rock-solid, and Gordon Elliott’s gelding is another prime candidate for the frame, along with Enjoy D’Allen. But Ted Walsh’s gelding is also up in the weights, and this is no longer a race in which previous experience of the obstacles is a significant advantage. The last five horses to win the National were seeing the famous fences for the first time, and the biggest threat to Any Second Now is likely to come from a younger, progressive opponent with less weight to carry. No horse in this year’s field fits that description quite like Longhouse Poet (nap 5.15), whose campaign has been built around Saturday’s race by a trainer who knows exactly what is required. Martin Brassil won the 2006 National with his first runner, Numbersixvalverde, and having saddled the same horse to finish sixth a year later, he did not return to Aintree until 2014, when Double Seven, the joint-favourite, finished third. Longhouse Poet was a deeply impressive winner of the Thyestes Chase in January, a race that Numbersixvalverde won in the season before his National success, and has been kept fresh since a run over hurdles in February. At around 16-1, he is an excellent bet to give Brassil a second victory in the world’s greatest steeplechase.

4/9/2022,"A phone camera pans slowly across the portraits of 55 men, each wearing the dress uniform of Russia’s elite airborne units. Small candles have been placed by the photographs of the men, as have sky blue berets and the blue-and-white striped undershirts worn by the paratrooper units who led Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The video of the memorial for the soldiers of the 247th Guards Air Assault Regiment is unverified – it was first published by Russia’s iStories news outlet, which said it was submitted by a reader. But the footage adds weight to a growing consensus that the numbers of Russian casualties – especially among elite units such as the Russian airborne – are far higher than officials have so far admitted. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, said on Thursday that the country had “significant losses of troops and it’s a huge tragedy for us” during an interview on Sky News. The frank admission of the scale of Russian losses is rare among government officials, who have consistently assured the public and Vladimir Putin that Russia’s “special operation” is going according to plan. In an attempt at damage control on Friday, Peskov said he was referring to the official defence ministry numbers of 1,351 soldiers killed since Russia launched its invasion on 24 February. “You and I have the same numbers as those published by the defence ministry,” Peskov said. “This is a substantial number.” Ukraine has estimated that 18,900 Russian soldiers have died since the beginning of the war, citing its own recovery of bodies and intercepted Russian communications. Russia has called the Ukrainian numbers inflated. But questions about the Russian military’s accounting practices remain, as official statistics may not count soldiers missing in action, and critics have accused the Kremlin of intentionally covering up the high number of war dead to prevent discontent at home. And growing evidence suggests high numbers of casualties among the units that led Russia’s invasion in February, including paratrooper units considered to be the “tip of the spear”. The video of the memorial for the 247th Guards Air Assault Regiment, which is based in Stavropol, Russia, showed a number of men whose deaths have already been confirmed through public accounts. Another video from a nearby cemetery that is used by the unit, along with others, showed a long row of funeral wreaths. The unit was reported to have fought in southern Ukraine near the city of Kherson, which has been held by the Russian army since late February. A Ukrainian counter-attack near Kherson has led to heavy losses for Russian troops there. Last month, Russia reported the death of the commander of the regiment, Col Konstantin Zizevsky, one of at least eight Russian colonels to have been killed during the war in Ukraine. BBC Russian, which has kept a confirmed count of the number of Russian losses, has said that 217 of its 1,083 confirmed Russian war dead were officers, from junior lieutenants to generals. Senior Russian officers often fight alongside their units because decisions must be confirmed by higher-ranking personnel. Of the confirmed deaths in the military, more than 15% come from Russia’s elite airborne, or VDV, units. The high number of losses among those units has also been accompanied by reports of desertions. According to the opposition Pskovskaya Guberniya newspaper, about 60 Russian paratroopers are facing disciplinary action after refusing to travel from Belarus, where many had been dispatched for what they believed were exercises, into Ukraine. Those reports have not been confirmed. But Russian media have also reported on members of two national guards units that have refused to fight in Ukraine. And lawyers say that soldiers from more than 17 cities have requested aid to either avoid being sent to Ukraine or ask for help in returning home. “They’re all reporting being pressured, facing the threat of criminal charges, being discharged, or having their documents withheld,” wrote Pavel Chikov, head of the Agora international human rights group. “For protection from a possible criminal investigation, please contact our lawyers.”",News/World news,Russians start to see evidence of high military casualties in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/08/russians-start-to-see-evidence-of-high-military-casualties-in-ukraine
4/9/2022,"The Bafta games awards took place at Queen Elizabeth Hall in London on Thursday night, honouring 2021’s creative achievements in video gaming. It was the first time the ceremony had been held in person since the pandemic and brought together the international video games industry to celebrate a range of titles – some with multimillion-dollar budgets, others made by teams of fewer than 10. The biggest winner of the night was the PlayStation 5 sci-fi shooter Returnal, which won accolades for audio achievement and music alongside the prestigious best game award. The lead actor in the game, Jane Perry, also won the award for performer in a leading role for her portrayal of steely space scout Selene. Performer in a supporting role was won by Kimberly Brooks, who played Hollis Forsythe in the psychedelic action game Psychonauts 2. Many of the games nominated were developed under challenging conditions during the pandemic. “This was a really hard game to finish,” said a developer of Forza Horizon 5, picking up the award for best British game – one of several winners to show their emotions after a difficult period for the industry. Indie games did very well: The Artful Escape, a video game rock opera, won the award for artistic achievement, and the heartfelt adventure Chicory: A Colourful Tale won in the family category. The entire eight-person team behind indie photography adventure TOEM took the stage to accept the award for debut game. No Man’s Sky, which was first released in 2016 to considerable controversy, picked up the Bafta for best evolving game, while Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart won for animation and technical achievement. Before Your Eyes, a game about the afterlife, won in the game beyond entertainment category, and the mysterious, unpredictable and eerie critical darling Inscryption took the award for game design. The EE game of the year award, decided by a public vote, was won by Unpacking, a touching, meditative game about moving house and organising possessions. It was picked up by a delighted and visibly surprised Tim Dawson and Wren Brier of Australian studio Witch Beam. Unpacking also won for best narrative, beating out bigger-budget competitors such as Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy and art-deco time-travel game Deathloop. Despite nominations in five categories, Deathloop won none. The other most-nominated game, the quirky, co-operative adventure It Takes Two, won the multiplayer and original property categories.
