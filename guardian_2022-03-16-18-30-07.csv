3/16/2022,"Canada and the US have issued a rare public notice over planned military exercises in the Arctic amid growing concern over Russian aggression. The North American Aerospace Defense Command said on Tuesday that it would hold air defence exercises throughout the Canadian Arctic, adding that the drills were meant to test the ability to “respond to both aircraft and cruise missiles” threatening the continent. Operation Noble Defender has been a recurring event in recent years, but the drills have taken on new meaning in the weeks since Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Speaking at a defence conference before the operation, Canada’s top soldier said that while the threat of a Russian incursion into Canada’s Arctic was low at the moment, he would not rule it out in years to come. Gen Wayne Eyre, the chief of defence staff, said it was “not inconceivable that our sovereignty may be challenged” from the Arctic region and that Canada needed to closely watch Russian action elsewhere. In recent years, Russia has increased its military presence in land bases in the Arctic, and launched a string of provocative aerial missions. Two years ago, a pair of long-range Russian bombers buzzed Canadian airspace before turning back. The TU-160 Blackjack bombers, capable of carrying nuclear missiles, crossed the North Pole and approached Canada from western Russia. Experts agree that any overt military aggression in the Arctic would probably take the form of attacks from the air and sea, rather than the land. Russia has previously tested hypersonic missiles that would be difficult, if not impossible, to detect with much of the current technology deployed in the Arctic. Moscow’s brazen attack on Ukraine three weeks ago has renewed worries the Russian president has become increasingly unpredictable – and raising tensions in other regions where Russia has shown signs of aggression. “If Putin were rational, it’d be a different story,” said the retired Canadian colonel Pierre Leblanc, who spent years overseeing troops in the northern reaches of the country. “But he’s forcing us to destroy his country’s economy. And despite all the threats, all the sanctions, he continues to bomb civilian targets, and commit war crimes.” Despite the vulnerabilities of the region, Leblanc said successive Canadian governments had failed to modernize early warning systems and neglected the development of military bases and deep water ports. He pointed out a gap of 2,800km between Inuvik and Iqaluit, the two forward operating locations for Canada’s F-18 planes, leaving vast swaths of land and sea exposed and difficult to patrol. At the same time, the technology behind short-range radar used to guard the region is “largely obsolete” and that parts used in repairs are no longer manufactured. “If you placed all of continental Europe in the Canadian Arctic, there’d be room to spare. So when we sending out monitoring ships, it would be the equivalent of sending out two ships to monitor all of Europe. If you suggested that, you’d be laughed out of the room.” In recent years, Leblanc has become a strong advocate for developing a base and deep water port in Resolute Bay and believes greater investment in the region would create jobs for Inuit communities. Earlier this month, the Inuit-run Nasittuq Corporation was announced as the winner of a C$592m (US$464m) contract to operate the North Warning System, a 37-year-old network of dozens of remotely operated radar stations stretching more than 5,000km along the edge of the Arctic Ocean. The radar system functions as a critical set of eyes on the region’s airspace but needs significant upgrades. But Michael Byers, a professor of political science at the University of British Columbia who focuses on Arctic issues, argued that Russia had little incentive to show aggression in the Canadian Arctic. “[It’s] the largest country in the world and it has considerable Arctic resources of its own. There’s nothing in Canada that Russia doesn’t have,” he said. He added that Moscow knew that any military interference in the Canadian Arctic could be a “tripwire into a full-blown” conflict with Nato. Instead, he said, Canada and allies should focus on the European Arctic, where Russia has a network of submarines capable of launching nuclear missiles. “The idea that we need to be worried about a Russian invasion strikes me as misleading, because we know where the real concern is,” said Byers. “The real concern is in Europe, today.” Still, Leblanc said the recent events in Ukraine had highlighted the importance of planning for future events, even if the odds of military attacks remained low. “We have very little resources to actually look after a beautiful part of our country,” he said. “Ukrainians are dying for their land. We barely protect ours.”",News/World news,Canada and US announce Arctic military exercises amid Russia tensions,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/16/canada-us-arctic-military-exercises-russia
3/16/2022,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine entered a third week, with several towns in the east and south suffering under grim conditions. In the western city of Lviv, life has gone on largely as normal – though the threat of war was brought home to many residents by a deadly missile assault on a military base in the nearby town of Yavoriv last weekend. Lorenzo Tondo and Peter Beaumont report on the mood in a city considered to be Ukraine’s cultural heart, and the preparations being made for a Russian assault. Also this week, Mark Rice-Oxley separates truth from fiction over Russia’s claims for justification of its actions. Luke Harding speaks to foreign fighters flocking to Ukraine’s aid, and we also hear from the country’s hidden army of young, tech-savvy workers who are turning their talents to the cyber-war effort. Moscow may have been surprised by the extent of western economic sanctions. But as fuel prices rise sharply in Europe and the US, how long will popular support be sustained in the west, and can Russia’s vast fossil fuel industry really be throttled? Diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour takes a deep dive into a global dilemma, while Larry Elliott considers the significance of the western corporate retreat from Russia, symbolised by the closure of McDonald’s restaurants. While the west has scrambled to shut off Moscow’s access to financial assets, attention has turned to Britain’s cosy relationship with the Russian oligarchs. How and why did London afford them such a warm welcome? Oliver Bullough chronicles the case of Dmitry Firtash, a gas billionaire who was accepted into the heart of the British establishment despite being wanted for alleged bribery by the FBI. Over the course of his career as a Guardian foreign correspondent, Ian Black amassed a large collection of political curiosities gathered from the stopping points on his travels.

3/16/2022,"Tower blocks have formed the narrative spine of many a novel, most notably JG Ballard’s High-Rise, in which the plush new building’s many levels represent the subtle hierarchical differences in a largely middle-class society, which descends into chaos, then total collapse. The 20-storey high-rise in Glaswegian writer Ryan O’Connor’s luminous debut is already condemned when we enter it, occupied only by junkies, a few marginal stragglers – “forgotten sentinels hovering behind clouds or sunlight reflecting off the glass, like ghost figures in double negatives” – and the novel’s unnamed 30-year-old narrator. After an opening that suggests an anti-gentrification story is about to unfold, there comes the first of many unexpected tonal shifts. The backstory of our hapless, hopeless host – a sometime journalist whose specialist subject is the pursuit of oblivion – is slowly revealed via a picaresque journey into an alternative, hyper-hedonistic Glasgow, in episodes involving a heroic intake of drink and drugs. Some are comic, others tragic, but all end up somewhere degraded and regretful: a drug den, a brothel, a funeral. We see relationships form, falter fleetingly and then collapse dramatically as bottles get smashed and our protagonist embarks on another round of bad decisions and blackouts. These scenes, perhaps inevitably, most recall the work of modern Scottish forefathers James Kelman and Irvine Welsh, and, in the reimagining of a city, Alasdair Gray’s Lanark. The manic edge and perpetually stumbling forward motion of the prose is also reminiscent of literary precursors such as JP Donleavy’s The Ginger Man. It is testament to O’Connor, however, that The Voids is not merely emulation. He’s capable of lurching from an absurdly comic hallucination scene in a Chinese restaurant one moment, to a heartbreaking recollection of childhood abandonment by neglectful parents the next, all while delivering observations such as: “Even loneliness loses its shine when you realise you are not in fact the loneliest person in the world, only one of many.” Then it’s briskly on to the next pill-popping, acid-dropping disaster. If all this sounds like a relentless series of kamikaze leaps between ecstatic highs and crushing lows, it very much is, and readers’ enjoyment will depend on their propensity for being dragged from one bender to the next without so much as a moment’s respite to recharge, refuel or at least swig an ice-cold Irn-Bru. In its restless energy and episodic structure, The Voids certainly reads like a debut novel, and there is something nostalgically 1990s-ish about its unapologetic scenes of wanton hedonism, in which pills are kissed into mouths by strangers and chapters begin: “I met Mia at a party in a nearby high-rise after almost coming to blows with a gay amputee junkie.” This section, incidentally, follows an utterly touching depiction of the suicide of a grieving pensioner, who soft-shoe shuffles off the high-rise roof to the strains of Sinatra singing Fly Me to the Moon. It is in these pockets of poetry and lucid observations – those moments of clarity that all drunks strive for – that O’Connor is at his best. By finding nobility in the relentless squalor and Bosch-like mayhem, he proves himself a writer capable of revealing the humanity in everyone. In an era when contemporary fiction is leaning ever more towards identity and relatability, it’s gratifying to know there’s still a place for a literary ride as wild as this. If The Voids feels out of step with the world, then it’s all the better for it.  Benjamin Myers’ Male Tears is published by Bloomsbury. The Voids by Ryan O’Connor is published by Scribe (£14.99).

3/16/2022,"The Tagus estuary near Lisbon is Portugal’s largest wetland, a vital habitat and stopover for tens of thousands of migratory birds, including flamingos, black-tailed godwits and glossy ibis. It has also been earmarked as the site of a new airport, leading the environmental law charity ClientEarth and a group of Portuguese NGOs to sue Portugal’s government. When they get their day in court, they will argue that the authorities failed to properly consider how the project would affect an internationally protected nature reserve, and the knock-on effects on other countries visited by the birds. “If you destroy that site, you have an impact not only in Lisbon, but on all the sites up the flyway,” says Anna Heslop, head of wildlife and habitats at ClientEarth. “If the bird populations don’t arrive, they never get breeding.” While environmental lawsuits are not a new phenomenon – the earliest known case, a dispute over water resources, dates back 4,500 years – campaigners are thinking more deeply about how they can tackle the complex problem of modern biodiversity loss. Heslop says litigants are increasingly looking beyond a single site or narrow issue. “Those older school cases will continue. What we aim to do is to have a bigger impact across the whole, like every site in Europe or south-east Asia, or to push governments to be more ambitious. The trick for us is finding cases that will have a more strategic impact; I don’t think that was happening on the same scale before.” The lack of a strategic approach to date is partly a reflection of a wider misunderstanding of the scale of the global biodiversity crisis, says Heslop. “Climate change advocates have done a great job over the last 10, 20 years, of making people realise this is a massive issue and therefore they get more of the resources,” says Heslop. “But they’re twin and equal crises and if you fix climate change and not biodiversity, we’re all screwed.” Guillaume Futhazar, a senior research fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law, is part of a team that has been studying biodiversity litigation around the world and is publishing a book on their findings. They knew it was an important issue, but it was not getting the same attention as the growing wave of lawsuits on the climate crisis. Our biosphere – the thin film of life on the surface of our planet – is being destabilised by temperature change. Extreme weather events are becoming more common, with flooding, sea level rises, droughts and storms all affecting biodiversity and its ability to support us. In the ocean, heatwaves and acidification are stressing organisms and ecosystems already under pressure from human activities such as overfishing and habitat fragmentation. The landmark Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report showed that extreme heatwaves that would usually happen every 50 years are already happening every decade. If warming is kept to 1.5C these will happen approximately every five years. The effect of the climate crisis on the Earth’s biodiversity is already being seen. The distributions of 47% of land-based flightless mammals and almost a quarter of threatened birds may already have been negatively affected by the climate crisis, the IPBES (Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services) warns. Five per cent of species are at risk of extinction from 2C warming, climbing to 16% with a 4.3C rise. Scientists increasingly argue the climate and biodiversity crises are linked. The destruction of the planet’s carbon-rich habitats, such as peatlands, forests, wetlands and grasslands, is damaging biodiversity and releasing vast amounts of greenhouse gases. If 15% of the world’s most degraded land was restored, and the remaining habitats which are still in good condition protected, it could store a third of all greenhouse gas emissions created by humans since the Industrial Revolution, according to researchers. Futhazar notes that laws governing different facets of biodiversity, such as endangered species, clean water or land use, are well established in many countries. But he says a better understanding of ecosystem dynamics, the increasingly central role of science in lawsuits and greater judicial awareness of the systemic nature of the problem are helping lawyers choose and structure their cases more carefully. Founded in 1971, the US NGO Earthjustice is no stranger to bringing environmental lawsuits in defence of wildlife and habitats. But, last summer, it launched a new initiative “laser-focused” on using the law to address major drivers of the biodiversity crisis. Timothy Preso, managing attorney of the organisation’s new biodiversity defense program, says it wants to partner with groups whose voices have been ignored in environmental litigation, such as indigenous and frontline communities, as well as raise awareness of critical biodiversity problems. The first case brought under the project was on behalf of the Ojibwe tribes of Wisconsin, challenging the state’s wolf hunting plans on the grounds that they conflict with treaties negotiated in the 19th century. “It raises really critical questions about wildlife management from the perspective of peoples who have been stewards of the environment in Wisconsin for about 15,000 years,” says Preso. “It’s a different approach to those issues.” Biodiversity campaigners are also learning from the success of climate litigation, which, Futhazar says, has “initiated a new creative way of thinking about how to deal with the environment”. Zaneta Sedilekova, a lawyer at Clyde & Co, thinks biodiversity litigation will go through a similar arc to its climate counterpart, with campaigners targeting countries first and then companies. She sees pollination as being at the forefront of such cases because of its importance to food security, “an issue that Covid has really highlighted”. In 2019, Costa Rica’s supreme court ordered the country’s agriculture ministry to undertake a scientific study into the ecosystem impacts of neonicotinoids, while legal action has more recently been threatened against the French government for failing to implement strong regulations to curb the use of bee-harming pesticides. Just as the fossil fuel industry is now in the direct sight of climate litigants, biodiversity campaigners are targeting the private sector too. Last year, indigenous peoples from the Brazilian and Colombian Amazon and NGOs filed a lawsuit against French supermarket chain Groupe Casino for allegedly selling beef products linked to deforestation. Casino argued it took a “rigorous” approach to its supply chains. Heslop sees more corporate liability cases related to biodiversity on the horizon. “The traditional way of telling companies that they were doing the wrong thing environmentally was to convince them that they needed to have some corporate social responsibility,” she says. “But the approach we’ve now taken is to say, well actually you have a duty to your investors and they will be let down if you do this because you’ll end up with a stranded asset or you’ll be sued. We’ve made that narrative for climate and we’re currently looking at how those sorts of cases could be applied for biodiversity.” Just as attribution science is enabling climate campaigners to link the emission of greenhouse gases with the harms caused by subsequent global warming, Sedilekova says growing requirements for corporations to be transparent about their supply chains and to exercise due diligence will help draw a line between a product and biodiversity loss, and hold companies accountable. She adds that the “corporate veil” that has historically shielded parent companies from action against their subsidiaries is increasingly being lifted. “The more supply chain data we have, the easier it will be to trace that ecosystem damage to a jurisdiction which has fast and efficient judicial service or judicial provision which is not corrupted, and where the defendant has a lot of money.” Sedilekova admits it is still hard to persuade businesses that biodiversity litigation is a real risk, but argues that it could be a powerful tool to change corporate behaviour. “The importance of litigation is to not turn one ship around, but to set a precedent so that others don’t wait for it to happen to them.” In the Tagus estuary case, ClientEarth argues the project breaches EU law and could have catastrophic effects on the migratory birds. Heslop hopes the case will have a wider impact and could set a precedent for the protection of other species in the world. “Not just birds, but maybe dolphins or whales or others. That’s where what feels like a very local issue actually could have a huge impact if we’re successful,” she says.

3/16/2022,"Events have lent an explosive new significance to this prophetic movie about the agony of exile from debut director Elie Grappe, which showed at Cannes last year and is now being released in UK cinemas to raise money for Ukrainian refugees. It concerns Olga, a dedicated teenage Ukrainian gymnast, excellently played by the real-life Ukrainian gymnast Anastasia Budiashkina, who herself last week arrived in Poland after escaping Kharkiv. In the movie, Olga leaves her homeland for Switzerland during the 2014 Maidan revolution to compete for the Swiss team during the European championships in Stuttgart. Her widowed mother was able to get her out to safety because Olga’s dad was Swiss, and she herself is being threatened by the state for her work as an investigative journalist uncovering corruption during the pro-Russian presidency. Olga is lonely, tired, scared, reflexively suspicious of her Swiss hosts – but also a superb competitor who can obliterate all her anxieties with her fanatical commitment to work in this state-of-the-art Swiss gym. But as the tough training programme continues and Olga’s tricky relationship with her sullen French- and Italian-speaking teammates gets complicated, the news comes through of how Ukraine (and her mother) are under brutal assault. Olga is wretched with remorse for leaving her friends and family for the bland safeness of Switzerland. The power, athleticism and beauty of her gymnastics now have a new choreography of guilt and rage. This is a film whose ideas and emotions have come into a fierce new focus. And there is an almost unbearable ironic flavour to the ending, which imagines a kind of emotional closure in 2020, a chastened acceptance of a precarious peace bought with bloody struggle all the way back in 2014. And the choice of Switzerland for Olga’s flag of convenience is a brilliant piece of symbolism. Olga is, in her troubled way, emblematic of Ukraine’s yearning for a new European identity, a peaceful and prosperous modernity and a (very Swiss) neutrality, in which its independence can be cocooned. But Olga is to see how there is also something evasive in her Swiss exile. She is mortified at the courage of the Ukrainian gymnasts when she comes face-to-face with them at the Euro championships and is convulsed with anger at the sight of one of them who has gone over to the Russians. In its unexpected way, this film speaks to the new agony of banishment now being felt by millions of Ukrainians, and to the profound unease and concern and impotence spreading westward across Europe.  Olga is released on 18 March in cinemas.

3/16/2022,"Constable Zachary Rolfe is on leave as the Northern Territory police investigates internal disciplinary matters, only days after he was found not guilty of murdering Kumanjayi Walker. Rolfe, 30, has been told to take leave as the force investigates several internal matters unrelated to the shooting, Guardian Australia has confirmed. It is unclear what those investigations concern. Walker died after he was shot three times by Rolfe during an attempted arrest in November 2019. Rolfe was acquitted after arguing at trial that he shot Walker to protect himself and his colleague after Walker stabbed him with scissors. The NT police association (NTPA) confirmed Rolfe had been asked to take leave because of disciplinary investigations, but declined to comment further. NTPA president, Paul McCue, said at a press conference on Monday that Rolfe’s suspension ended at the time the verdict was handed down, but he was “taking a breath” and the union expected to be served with paperwork from police “in relation to him taking some leave to determine what the next steps will be”. He said there was “no indication around what that paperwork specifically says”. “We’d be extremely disappointed if there was any further action pursued against him, but that would be up to the police force, and if that happens, we’ll be there to support him again.” A union spokesperson declined to comment on Tuesday about whether the paperwork had been served and the nature of the disciplinary investigation. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Rolfe’s legal team referred queries about the internal investigations to the union. The NT police force did not respond to a detailed request for comment. Rolfe had been asked outside court on Friday whether he intended to return to the NT police, but did not respond. Rolfe told the Australian in an interview published this week that he had been cleared over a handful of complaints made against him during his career. On Friday, a jury reached a unanimous decision that Rolfe was not guilty of the murder of Walker, a 19-year-old Warlpiri man, or of two alternative charges.",News/Australia news,Zachary Rolfe on leave as NT police investigates internal disciplinary matters,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/16/zachary-rolfe-on-leave-as-nt-police-investigates-internal-disciplinary-matters
3/16/2022,"England finally got some points on the board in their World Cup title defence, bowling India out for 134 in 36.2 overs – their lowest World Cup total since 2009 – before a see-saw chase got them over the line with four wickets and 112 balls to spare. Off-spinner Charlie Dean, playing in only her second World Cup match, finished with 4 for 23; while Anya Shrubsole (2 for 20) became the sixth Englishwoman to reach the milestone of 100 wickets in ODIs when she bowled Yastika Bhatia in the fourth over of the day. Heather Knight then returned to form with an unbeaten half-century, keeping her head while wickets fell at the other end, until Sophie Ecclestone finally sealed the deal in the 32nd over with a four slashed over midwicket. The win means that England have kept their slender hopes of qualifying for the semi-finals alive, though they remain reliant on other results going their way to avoid a premature exit. “It’s been a tricky tour,” Shrubsole admitted after play. “It’s been a while since we’ve won. For me personally, I wasn’t anywhere near where I would like to be against West Indies. It takes some honest reflections and some honest conversations with coaches. We haven’t shied away from the fact that we’ve been really poor in the field in the first three games and it’s potentially cost us some wins. It was really nice to put some of that right today, and hopefully it’s a step in the right direction for us moving forward.” “We’ll celebrate the win, and then it’s about getting to Auckland and turning our attention to the New Zealand game.” After winning the toss, England had chosen to chase, knowing they needed to do as much as possible to bump up their Net Run Rate in case of a multi-way scrap for a semi-final position. But despite the low target, they wobbled regularly with the bat. Initially, they were reduced to 4 for 2 after Sneh Rana took a diving screamer at slip to see off Danni Wyatt and Jhulan Goswami produced a beautiful inswinger, trapping Tammy Beaumont LBW after Mithali Raj successfully referred the decision upstairs. Nat Sciver was lucky not to be Goswami’s second victim of the day: she survived a ball in the fifth over which burst through her and rolled into the stumps, but by some miracle did not dislodge the bails. The seamer got her revenge in the 17th, pouching Sciver’s leading edge at mid-on, but Sciver’s run-a-ball 45 had by then steadied the ship. A last-minute stutter in the 29th over saw Sophia Dunkley (17) and Katherine Brunt dismissed within three balls of each other by Meghna Singh with seven runs still needed; but Knight and Ecclestone were able to finish the job. Whatever coach Lisa Keightley said to England in training on Tuesday appeared to have worked: for the first time in the tournament, England went an entire fielding innings without shelling a catch. Dunkley set the tone with a good, low snaffle at cover to see off Mithali Raj, before Kate Cross ran out Deepti Sharma with a direct hit from mid-off as India sunk to 28 for 3 in the opening eight overs. A second direct hit from Sciver in the 34th over, gathering the ball at midwicket before swiftly turning to throw down the stumps at the non-striker’s end, did for Richa Ghosh. But it was Dean, introduced in the 17th over, who inflicted the major damage. After being omitted from England’s XI in the opening two matches of the tournament, she came good for her captain, relying on an attacking line outside off-stump and copious drift. She sent down a double-wicket maiden first up, taking the outside edge of both Harmanpreet Kaur and Sneh Rana, both caught behind. Then, two balls after Pooja Vastrakar used DRS to overturn an LBW decision against her, Dean rapped her on the pads again; this time, the replay showed it had hit her in line. Bowling in tandem with Ecclestone, Dean dried up India’s run-scoring; it was frustration which eventually dislodged the stubborn Smriti Mandhana, trapped LBW for 35 by Ecclestone after missing a sweep. It was downhill from there, and Dean went on to wrap things up in the 37th over, bowling Meghna Singh. All in all it was a miserable display with the bat from India, and a somewhat surprising one, given that they were fresh from a huge 155-run thrashing of West Indies on Saturday. “We’ve shown a lot of fight as a team to come back from a few disappointing games and show what we can do,” Dean said, dedicating her Player of the Match award to her parents. “I was trying to keep it simple, bowl as tight to the stumps as I could do, and that worked well for me today.”",Sport/Sport,England keep slim World Cup hopes alive with four-wicket win over India,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/16/england-keep-slim-cricket-world-cup-hopes-alive-with-four-wicket-win-over-india
3/16/2022,"In Kyiv, a 12-storey residential building has been damaged after it was hit by Russian shelling this morning. Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv also came under attack overnight with two people confirmed dead and two residential buildings destroyed, Ukraine’s state emergency services said in an update this morning. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy gave a late-night national address where he confirmed meetings between Ukrainian and Russian officials continue, adding that “the positions at negotiations are more realistic now”. However, Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak said there are “fundamental contradictions” in talks aimed at ending Russia’s military attack but there is “certainly room for compromise”. Addressing Russian citizens, Zelenskiy said the war would end in “disgrace, poverty, year-long isolation [and] a brutal repressive system”. “If you stay in your posts, if you don’t speak out against the war, the international community will strip you off of everything you have earned over the years. They are working on it,” he said. Zelenskiy is due to address US Congress on Wednesday and is likely to make fresh calls for a no-fly zone and requests for more military aid, including fighter jets. EU leaders vowed support for Ukraine during a visit to Kyiv. The prime ministers of the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovenia arrived in the capital earlier on Tuesday in a show of support for Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who briefed them on the war with Russia. Poland’s Jarosław Kaczyński called for a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine, with Czech prime minister Petr Fiala saying: “You are not alone. Our countries stand with you. Europe stands with your country”. Nato is set to tell its military commanders on Wednesday to draw up plans for new ways to deter Russia following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, including more troops and missile defences in eastern Europe, officials and diplomats said. The Ukrainian minster for defence, Oleksii Reznikov, is expected to plead for more weapons from individual Nato countries, according to a Reuters report. US president Joe Biden is expected to announce an additional $800m in security assistance to Ukraine on Wednesday, a White House official said as reported by Reuters news agency. The US Senate unanimously passed a resolution late on Tuesday night condemning Russian president Vladimir Putin as a war criminal, a rare show of unity in the deeply divided Congress. Russian forces have reportedly taken patients and medical staff of a hospital in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol hostage. According to the BBC, the city’s deputy mayor Sergei Orlov said there were 400 people in the hospital and the Russian army were “using our patients and doctors like hostages”. About 2,000 cars were able to leave Mariupol, according to local authorities. A woman who interrupted a live news programme on Russian state TV last night to protest against the war in Ukraine has been fined 30,000 roubles (£215) by a Russian court. Marina Ovsyannikova, a Russian television producer, was found guilty of flouting protest legislation, the Russian state news agency RIA reported. The UK is to impose sanctions on 370 more Russian individuals, including more than 50 oligarchs and their families with a combined net worth of £100bn. More than 1,000 individuals and entities have now been targeted with sanctions since the invasion of Ukraine, with fresh measures announced against key Kremlin spokespeople and political allies of Putin, including the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu. Boris Johnson will visit Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday to ask the Gulf states to produce more oil and help the UK reduce dependence on Russian oil. More than 100,000 people in the UK have offered homes to Ukrainian refugees in the first 24 hours of a government scheme that allows families and individuals to bring them to the UK. China’s ambassador to the US penned an interesting op-ed for the Washington Post, saying his government knew nothing of Russia’s plans and would have tried to stop it if they had. China also lambasted Taiwan’s humanitarian aid for Ukraine and sanctions on Russia as “taking advantage of other’s difficulties” after the island announced it was sending more funds donated by the public for refugees.",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 21 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/16/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-21-of-the-invasion
3/16/2022,"Scott Morrison has left the door open to introducing sanctions against China, Australia’s largest trading partner, if Chinese president Xi Jinping’s regime were to provide military equipment to Russia. The prime minister said his government would move in lockstep with its allies and partners in response to what he called Beijing’s “chilling silence” on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. He said any move by China to arm Russia would be “an abomination”. The defence minister, Peter Dutton, also said China’s failure to condemn Russia “should send alarm bells across the world” while he suggested that “all free nations will face a darker tomorrow” if Vladimir Putin succeeds. “It is becoming clear that Putin’s Ukrainian gamble has been a miscalculation that may very well destroy the man himself,” Dutton told a United States Studies Centre event in Canberra. But experts questioned whether a so-called “palace coup” against Putin was likely, and whether Australia would expand sanctions to cover China. China remains Australia’s largest trading partner, despite Beijing launching a series of trade actions against Australian export sectors in recent years that have been at the centre of a downward spiral in the relationship. Dennis Richardson, former head of the departments of defence and foreign affairs, said it would surprise him “if we got to the point where sanctions were being imposed on China” because Beijing was likely to “operate in a grey area”. With an election looming in Australia in May, both major parties have stepped up their pleas for China to press Russia to end the conflict in Ukraine, citing the “no limits” partnership formalised between the two countries six weeks ago. The focus on Beijing has increased after US officials said they feared China had already decided to provide Russia with economic and financial support and was contemplating sending military supplies, such as armed drones. Joe Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said earlier this week that Beijing would “absolutely” face consequences if it helped Moscow avoid sanctions. Asked on Wednesday whether there was potential for Australia to impose sanctions against China, Morrison said: “We will move in lockstep with our partners and allies on these issues, and the United States has made some very clear statements about this and we support those statements.” He called on China “to be very transparent” about the nature of its relationship with Russia “when it comes to throwing them an economic lifeline during this global crisis”. The prime minister said Beijing should also clarify “potentially what, if any, support has been discussed for military support for Russia, because that would be an abomination”. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, was also asked about the possibility of sanctions against China and replied that he supported Australia “acting in conjunction with our partners in the world”. “China has a responsibility to call out Russia’s behaviour and its aggression. It’s outrageous, it’s against international law, and it should be called out by all countries,” Albanese said. Labor’s foreign affairs spokesperson, Penny Wong, met with China’s new ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, on Wednesday and expressed “her serious concerns over reports that Russia has asked China for weapons”. “Senator Wong urged China to support the people of Ukraine and its sovereignty, and not provide weapons to Russia,” said a readout issued by Wong’s office. China has not explicitly criticised Russia and it has not described it as an invasion, insisting that “all parties” should exercise restraint and “cool the situation down instead of adding fuel to the fire”. A foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, responded to reports that China had signalled its willingness to provide military assistance to Russia by accusing the US of “spreading disinformation”. At a daily press conference in Beijing, Zhao said the US should “deeply reflect upon its role in the evolving situation of the Ukraine crisis, and do more things that can help to ease the situation”. Pressed on whether China would rule out adding fuel to the fire by sending support to Russia, Zhao said: “Our position on the Ukraine issue is beyond reproach.” Richardson said Russia and China shared a strategic objective in weakening US global leadership. But he predicted Beijing would seek to limit any assistance provided to Russia in order to avoid reaching the threshold for western economic punishment. Richardson noted China had abstained, rather than explicitly sided with Russia, when the United Nations voted on motions deploring the invasion of Ukraine. “I think China will give what support it can to Russia that it thinks that it can get away with,” Richardson told the National Press Club on Wednesday. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Paul Dibb, another former senior defence official and strategic analyst, dismissed the likelihood of a “palace coup” or a popular uprising against Putin. He said the likelihood of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny facing another 13 years in prison reflected Putin’s approach to dissent. Dibb said Putin had curbed media coverage and tightened the security agencies protecting him, and “only listens to people who agree with him”. “I noticed Minister Dutton implied that there might be an internal issue,” Dibb said. “Well, with due respect, Minister, unless you have – and the Americans have – an agent inside the Kremlin, you ain’t going to get it. “I hope Dutton is right, but … this is not going to be at all easy.” Comment was sought from the Chinese and Russian embassies.",News/Australia news,‘An abomination’: Morrison signals sanctions against China if it helps arm Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/16/an-abomination-morrison-signals-sanctions-against-china-if-it-helps-arm-russia
3/16/2022,"“What are the fewest number of appearances for a club to have resulted in a testimonial? Must be a back-up goalkeeper surely?” tweets SixStarsUK. The time-honoured tradition of the testimonial is usually reserved for players who have reached a decade at a particular club, but not always. “Norman Clarke made just four league and one League Cup appearance for Sunderland in the 1962-3 season before injury cut his career short aged 21,” writes John Briggs. “He was awarded a testimonial on 28 September 1966 when 11,000-plus spectators watched a 6-6 draw against a ‘Charlton’s XI’ (Jimmy Montgomery playing on the wing for Sunderland and scored two, Jack Charlton played in goal). Clarke returned to Ireland where he continued playing for Ballymena United and later scouted for Liverpool.” A career-ending injury also led to John O’Neill being granted a testimonial with Norwich, despite playing little over half an hour for the club. “John O’Neill, the Northern Irish centre-half, suffered a career-ending injury on his City debut in 1987 (after a decade at Leicester and a short spell at QPR),” writes Roger Whittaker. “Norwich gave him a testimonial, even though he only played 34 minutes for them before having his knee rearranged by John Fashanu.” Gary Lineker, then at Barcelona, scored a hat-trick in an 8-2 victory for O’Neill’s Select XI. Fashanu later agreed to pay £70,000 in an out-of-court settlement after a high-profile court case in 1994 (during which O’Neill’s expert witness was Ken Aston, referee for Italy and Chile’s notorious “Battle of Santiago” at the 1962 World Cup), though O’Neill was left with £150,000 of legal costs. Finally, here’s Stephen Curnow. “I accept that non-playing staff are rather against the spirit of the question, but nevertheless I would like to put forward the case of Tim Sheppard, Norwich City physiotherapist from 1980-2001. Tim’s tenure spanned some of the club’s greatest successes, he having been on the bench through two promotions, a Milk Cup win, a European campaign, two FA Cup semi-finals and the club’s three best league finishes. He also had a brief cameo in Fever Pitch. Tim was awarded a testimonial upon his departure, appearing for his solitary minutes against Celtic at Carrow Road, the visitors winning 4-2.” “Given that the player of the match is usually announced around the 89th minute, what is the worst-ever performance of one after the announcement has been made?” wonders Andrew Chambers. Thanks to pundits either not paying enough attention or at the very least playing it safe, there are plenty of players who’ve been handed the gong having done little more than spend much of the 90 minutes struggling to get a touch of the ball only to poke home a key goal. However, for a fine example of this, we turn to one of the great games (and sliding doors moments) in English football history. “I nominate Vince Bartram, who was announced as man of the match for Gillingham against Manchester City in the 1999 third tier play-off final with 89:30 on the clock and the Gills 2-0 up,” writes Ian Kay. “Within 20 seconds Kevin Horlock pulled a goal back and Paul Dickov got the equaliser in the 95th minute. Goalkeeper Bartram – Dickov’s best man, incidentally – didn’t save any penalties in the shootout either, as City won it 3-1 (despite Dickov’s penalty hitting both posts and coming back to him).” “A lot of questions go unanswered,” begins Eugene Francis. “I feel this will be one: has a goalkeeper ever taken a corner?” Step forward Javi Yegros of CD Pedrusco de Garbayuela in Spain, who not only took a corner but only went and scored from it as well. “I imagine many goalkeepers have taken corners, but Yegros stands out,” writes Tim Dockery. “He had trained as an outfield player until an injury made him switch to exclusively playing in goal. With his team (in Extremadura’s local second division) down 1-0 and time running out, he went upfield to take his side’s free-kicks and eventually a couple of corners. On the last play of the game, he mis-hit his corner and a strong wind carried it directly into the goal to tie the game. It’s the only instance I know of where a goalie scored an Olympic goal.” In response to the question “What is the most common day of the week for the English league championship to be decided?”, fuzzybluerain started delving. It’s an impressive work in progress, so if there are any gaps you can help fill in … “In Roy Hattersley’s book, The Edwardians, there’s a photo described as ‘the Edwardian England football team’. They are wearing white shirts and dark shorts, but curiously the shirts bear the Union Jack rather than the flag of St George. Was the Union Jack generally used by England teams back then, or was it just a cock-up?” asked Matt Boyson in January 2008. The union flag was the favoured emblem of English football teams until surprisingly recently. Footage of the 1966 World Cup shows Wembley dotted with red, white and blue flags, while tournament mascot World Cup Willie was a lion wearing a Union flag jersey. In 1982 Ron Greenwood’s England squad were still urging us to “hear the roar of the red white and blue” on official tune This Time, a seven-inch single with a union flag on the label. It was only really at Euro 96 that the nation’s red-and-white fetish kicked in properly. Matthew Engel, writing in the Guardian, noted “this new cult of St George” after England’s exit in the semi-finals. Ten years later 27% of English adults bought a flag of St George during the 2006 World Cup. And a fat lot of good it did too. “Are Chelsea the first football club to be hit with government sanctions?” asks Colin Babe. “On Saturday Viking played Kongsvinger in the last 16 of the Norwegian cup,” writes Arne Bjarne Fjøsmælås. “Viking won 2-0, scoring after 28 seconds in the first half and 21 seconds in the second half. Of course, faster goals have been scored in both halves, but are there any better than a total of 49 seconds for both combined?” “We know the Wright/Wright-Phillips family can run to three generations of professional footballers, but are there any examples of four or more generations?” wonders David Burrows. “With little over a month to go in their season, Craigmark Burntonians of the West of Scotland League have a chance of being promoted to tier six of the Scottish pyramid and a chance of being relegated to tier nine,” notes Doug Coyle. “Has any team been less certain of their status next season this late on?” “With David de Gea picking the ball out of his net four more times against City, I’m wondering if he’s the keeper who’s conceded most goals in the Manchester derby,” muses Philip Grey. “It seems natural to wonder which keeper has conceded most goals in any derby (two clubs from the same city, not fake derbies that really aren’t derbies).”  Mail us your questions or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU.",Sport/Football,Which footballer played the fewest games to earn a testimonial? | The Knowledge,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/16/who-played-the-fewest-games-to-earn-a-testimonial-the-knowledge
3/16/2022,"If you were lucky enough to be a small kid roaming Disney World’s Epcot Center until just a few years ago, you would have seen a ride nestled next to the monorail tracks that beckoned with gleaming mirror walls. An indoor ride, it was a welcome reprieve from the Florida sun. After buckling into your seat in what seemed like a theater auditorium, and the lights dimmed, a familiar figure would appear on the huge screen in front of you. “You’re probably surprised to see me here, aren’t you?” pealed a twinkly Ellen DeGeneres. The ride purported to tell the story of energy. It was awe-inspiring and warm-hearted in the Disney mold and also featured Jamie Lee Curtis, the late Jeopardy host Alex Trebek and science communicator Bill Nye. What went unsaid was the fact that, for a theme park, it had an unlikely corporate sponsor: the US oil giant Exxon. And the message directed at the often young minds of riders was brazen and, in the light of the climate emergency now unfolding, quite remarkable: fossil fuels are glorious and the climate crisis is not such a big deal. Yet somehow, even though it only shuttered in 2017, the ride has largely been lost to cultural history. But now, as Exxon and other oil firms face a wave of lawsuits seeking to hold them accountable for the climate crisis, grounded by charges that they sought to deceive the public about their role in it, the ride seems newly relevant as evidence of the kind of narrative big oil sought to promote. Exxon supported it although the company had known for decades how ruinous the climate crisis would be, but kept its findings secret. 1982, the year the ride opened, was the same year that Exxon’s own scientists predicted that a spike in carbon dioxide emissions would result in the warming of the planet. So buckle up for the story of Ellen’s Energy Adventure. The ride begins with riders still watching a movie screen as DeGeneres, snuggling with her cat in front of an episode of Jeopardy!, takes a nap. She dreams that she is a contestant on the show, alongside Curtis and Albert Einstein. All the questions are themed around energy. (For instance: fossil fuels for $100!) DeGeneres finds that her knowledge of fossil fuels pales beside that of Curtis, who plays a smarmy scientist type. Nye happily materializes to take her on an educational journey back, way back about 220m years. We soar past dazzling solar systems and nebulas, zeroing in on a familiar blue marble, and crash-land in a tropical forest. We hear the cries of strange animals. DeGeneres, confused: Where’s the energy? Nye, wearing a pith hat: Oh, it’s all around you! See these plants and animals are soaking up energy from the sun. When they die and get buried, time, pressure and heat will cook them into the fossil fuels we rely on today – like coal, natural gas and oil! And now the ride becomes very different, as the cinema screen disappears and the seating sections begin to move, passing dioramas of roaring animatronic dinosaurs, and even an animatronic model of DeGeneres herself fighting a feisty reptile. It is Jurassic Park, but cheesier. When the movie resumes, the ride’s sympathies have all the subtlety of a tyrannosaurus. Nye teaches DeGeneres about renewables, but warns they can’t provide all of humanity’s needs. Riders are then treated to lyrical aerial shots of a coal train and jaunty music. Nye tells DeGeneres not to worry about the world’s energy problems – there are thankfully two centuries’ worth of coal left for us to burn. DeGeneres, guileless: What about global warming? Nye, noncommittal: It’s a hot topic with lots of questions and it’s one of the big reasons scientists are working on ways to burn fuels like coal more efficiently than ever. (Factcheck: the industry promises of “clean coal” have not been borne out.) Cue shots of a gas power plant (Nye, incorrectly, states: “It’s clean-burning!”) and oil rigs. A worried DeGeneres asks Nye whether we’ll run out of oil. Nye reassures her that we’re always finding more. For the ride’s finale, DeGeneres returns to Jeopardy!. She vanquishes that unctuous Jamie Lee Curtis and realizes the true, Disney-esque conclusion of the whole experience: The world’s greatest source of energy is in fact … (God help us) the human mind. Though understated compared with the rollercoasters and 4D rides, Ellen’s Energy Adventure was a beloved part of the Disney machine. It built up a devoted fandom that spawned countless YouTube videos, tweets, wikis and blogposts. “It was the very first Disney attraction I ever experienced,” says 27-year-old Landon, a Disney enthusiast whose family took him there when he was 13 (and who did not want to share his last name). “I enjoyed the cheesy humor and the prehistoric animatronics. As midwesterners, it felt pretty fresh.” DeGeneres, Nye, Disney and Exxon all did not respond to requests for comment for this story, so everyone’s motivations will remain somewhat mysterious. But Exxon and other oil firms have engaged in a decades-long campaign to counter climate warnings, which would entail attempting to intimidate its critics, deploying DC lobbyists, releasing misleading statements while suppressing factual information and yes, also capturing the hearts and minds of impressionable youth at the happiest place on Earth. The ride wasn’t the only collaboration Exxon had with Disney – they also published a comic book featuring Goofy and Mickey Mouse. And Exxon wasn’t the only energy company wooing kids. BP used to sponsor an exhibit at a New Orleans aquarium. The same BP that was behind the largest marine oil spill in history somewhere off the coast of New Orleans. At Disney, “it’s easy to imagine that they wanted to indoctrinate children so that children don’t realize that ExxonMobil is destroying the future planet that they will inherit, which is incredibly machiavellian and evil,” says prominent climatologist Dr Michael Mann. Fast forward and Ellen’s Energy Adventure with all its oil-shilling playfulness is long gone, and is in the process of being replaced by a newer, flashier Guardians of the Galaxy ride. (“What is pain” one fan account tweeted about its closure.) Fossil fuel interests have moved on to more sophisticated tactics to sway the public, no longer outright denying the impact of climate change but shifting to a strategy of deflection and delay. The cost of changing to another energy source is simply too prohibitive, they say, even though “the cost of inaction now far exceeds the cost of action”, explains Mann. And it turns out that fossil fuel giants might have been right to be concerned about children. In this modern age, one of the great threats to our world’s fossil fuel dependency is the youth climate movement. (An Opec boss seemed to say as much.) As we struggle to find a way forward, it’s illuminating to look backward at this bizarre ride that originated in the pre-internet age and will forever live at the intersection of climate disruption, corporate deception and millennial nostalgia. In what feels like a prescient scene from the ride, a chirpy DeGeneres glances at the audience in the middle of her time-traveling dream sequence and quips: “Is this a nightmare, or what?”",News/Environment,"A pro-fossil fuel Disney ride voiced by Ellen DeGeneres and Bill Nye?

3/16/2022,"When Major League Soccer decided to build Centene Stadium in St Louis, the first priority was honoring the “the hard truths of past”. The 22,500-seat soccer-specific stadium is designed with canopy shading and is 40ft below street level. It also sits on the same block that was once a part of Mill Creek Valley, the predominantly Black neighborhood on the Southwest end of St Louis once home to 20,000 residents, 800 businesses and more than 40 religious institutions. In addition to Madame ‘CJ’ Walker, America’s first Black woman millionaire, Mill Creek was also home to Josephine Baker, Scott Joplin and General William Tecumseh Sherman. Even poet Walt Whitman was known to visit the thriving Black community. But in the summer of 1959, the residents of Mill Creek Valley were displaced and the neighborhood demolished in the name of “urban renewal”. Now the embryonic MLS club St Louis City SC and Great Rivers Greenway are using the stadium as a platform to tell the story of Mill Creek Valley. “It was really setting a precedent of starting as a community-led brand and community-led club that was actually entrenched in the community in more ways than just the sport,” says Khalia Collier, vice-president of community relations for St Louis City SC. Mill Creek Valley, as it once was, spanned the downtown west district of St Louis. Today, the one-mile stretch of the Brickline Greenway linking Centene Stadium to Harris-Stowe State University, the city’s HBCU, will be a standing tribute to the community that was lost. Artist and native St Louisan Damon Davis says Mill Creek Valley is a virtually unknown part of Black history he was previously not aware of. “I learned about it during the research phase of preparing the application,” Davis says. “I was kind of embarrassed. Growing up we learned about Black history and I knew about all these people around the world, but I didn’t know this place existed.” Davis own the bid to design the artwork for the Counterpublic Civic Art Exhibition in 2023 and, after learning about the neighborhood, he wanted to know more. As a result, Davis was moved to create a monument that he says will never be forgotten. The greenway and public art installation runs from 20th to 22nd Street and consists of eight pillars or hourglasses that represent time – or a collective history that Davis says had been glossed over. Within each hourglass is a pyramid symbolic the earth or sand at a standstill. “If the sand is not falling that means time is not moving, so the idea of the pyramid being in the top chamber, is the idea we have stopped for a second to commemorate and to have reverence for these histories that were purposely covered up,” Davis says. “There was an intention behind removing these people from the narrative of St Louis and now there must the same intention behind bringing their stories back to life.” In between the pillars in front of Centene Stadium and Harris-Stowe State University will be interpretative signs and individual pillars connecting the few remaining buildings from Mill Creek Valley along the greenway. Davis interviewed former residents and then inscribed quotes inside of each of the individual pillars. “The quotes will tell you a story about Mill Creek,” Davis says. “St. Louis wouldn’t be what is without these people.” From the 1950s to the mid 80s, St Louis was considered the soccer capital of the US thanks to a large immigrant population from Germany, Italy and Ireland that produced more homegrown soccer players than any other state. Currently. St Louis has acres of soccer fields spanning out into the Northwest suburbs of Chesterfield, Fenton and St Charles, but as Collier says. once you cross the Daniel Boone Bridge, you scarcely know the sport exists. St Louis City FC’s headquarters, training facility and stadium are strategically located within a 10-mile radius of the downtown west district. The location makes it easy to prioritize resources and give sustainable infrastructure where it did not exist, Collier says. Right now, the expansion club is working through an infrastructure plan to make the game more accessible. The areas of impact are youth development – which prioritizes Black and brown children having access to the soccer – community investment, social justice, and health and wellness. “You can say bridging the gap in the game of soccer is really lofty, but how we’re going about doing it is incredibly intentional and we’re calling community members in, so they see these opportunities of us integrating technology and sport innovation in a way that’s simply hasn’t been done,” Collier says. The St Louis City SC app features stories about Mill Creek Valley, where fans can learn how the current landscape represents the row houses that made up the vibrant community. On the stadium grounds there are black granite outlines of the three homes that stood there. The stadium also incorporates plaques into the landscape as hedgerows representing homes and within the landscape is the address of each home. Because St Louis is a predominantly Black city .Collier says it’s important to share the history of the neighborhood and also include the community in what St Louis City SC is up to off the pitch. The nascent club is eager to engage the next generation about career opportunities within the sport. The MLS is the youngest and most diverse sports league in the country and St Louis City want to reflect that on every level. Before the stadium opened, the club had the most participation of African Americans on any major project in the city of St Louis. The club also sourced staff from the local workforce to boost economic development in Black and Brown communities. Collier says that’s just the beginning as they continue to hire ahead of the official start of play in March 2023. In addition to the greenways, the Brickline connecting St Louis will be used as a catalyst for growth and partnership. Great Rivers Greenway and the Brickline Greenway is focused on community engagement based on equity and economic development, says Susan Trautman, CEO of Great Rivers Greenway. The vision for the Brickline Greenway is 20 miles of pathways that connects 17 neighborhoods including Forest Park, Gateway Arch National Park, Fairground Park and Tower Grove Park. While the area along Mill Creek is largely developed, GRG is partnering with several organizations in an equity economic development working group with goals centered around people, power, places and systems. Trautman says it was essential that the working group receive input from the community about how to revitalize the areas of disinvestment in North St Louis. “It’s about using the community voice to make decisions about how land and real estate is developed,” Trautman says. “And working in tandem with our nonprofit partners we will have an equity economic director who encourage and support development that is driven by community need adjacent to the greenway.” GRG recently released an RFQ for design to build the Brickline North section. The organization then held a mixer to allow small businesses owned by people of color to become part of the major design team effort. GRG is focused on design and construction in the North St Louis area where “there is not as much opportunity”. and real estate development is focused on the 500ft to quarter-mile perimeter of the Brickline, where economic development is more likely to occur. “The biggest part of making sure people in the community are engaged is educating them on how they can be engaged and introducing them to opportunities where maybe they are a sub consultant to start so maybe they can grow their business,” Trautman says. From Davis’ artwork to economic initiatives, St Louis City SC is striving to be a new spirit in St Louis through the power of sport. And for the club, acknowledging the past is part of building for a better future. Collier says the monument dedicated to the story of Mill Creek Valley goes beyond the fan experience, but it pushed St Louis in the middle of a national conversation. “Not only do we get to educate St Louisans, we get to educate the world,” Collier says. “But this is going to be a national monument in St Louis and there’s nothing like this in sports.”",Sport/Football,St Louis City SC looks to MLS future by remembering ‘hard truths of past’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/16/st-louis-city-sc-mill-creek-valley
3/16/2022,"On one level, it was a statement of the obvious from Harry Kane. The Tottenham striker sat down with Sky Sports before his team’s Premier League game at Brighton on Wednesday night and, among other things, said he wanted to play Champions League football. Context, though, is everything. This is Kane, the 28-year-old England captain, who said the same thing leading up to last summer, when he attempted to leave a club that could not offer him action in Europe’s elite competition for one that certainly could – and plenty else, besides. Kane did not get a move to Manchester City and it is unclear whether the Premier League champions would push for him again at the end of this season – and not only because they found the negotiations so tortuous last time out. Were Kane to have had a release clause in his Spurs contract, which expires in June 2024, like, say, Jack Grealish did in his deal at Aston Villa, the situation would have been different. Maybe it still can be. It is understood that the City hierarchy told Kane’s people to renegotiate with Spurs and get something written in – however difficult that may be. But there is nothing at the moment and so there we are and here we are, with Kane looking at his team’s final 11 matches of the league season and hoping to drive a sequence that ends with them in the top four. “Personally, you want to be in the best competitions in the world,” Kane told Sky. “My focus is on this year. Getting top four is the most important goal for us now. If we can get on a run, this is more than possible. That’s all I can control and that’s all the manager can control as well. Let’s see where we end up.” There is one certainty. Kane will give everything to help his boyhood club back into the Champions League. But, beyond that, there is nothing and, in the event that Spurs fall short, it is easy to see another summer saga involving Kane. The drums have started to beat, Kane’s reminder about where he wants to be coming as Antonio Conte faced familiar but insistent questions on Tuesday lunchtime about the future of his talisman. The Spurs manager was asked directly on two occasions whether the club needed to finish in the Champions League places to persuade Kane not to look elsewhere and there were further, more lateral attempts to get him to engage with the topic. Conte’s stance was exactly the same as that of Kane. The focus is on the remaining games. And then we will see. “In this moment, it is not important to speak about the future,” Conte said. “It is important to see the present because the present is more important. We have to try to get the best in these 11 games and then we will see. It is important to be focused on the present and we have a lot of time to sit around the table and then to speak about everything. “At the end of the season – or [just] before then – everyone has to speak about their own vision. I speak about my vision, the club will speak about theirs, [Fabio] Paratici [the managing director of football] will speak about his and then we will see. Now it is too early. For sure, there will be a moment when we will go to take decisions.” Conte’s vision remains clear. He wants to be able to compete and win trophies. He even suggested that he only needed to feel “one per cent to win the title or a trophy in which we participate” for him to have something to get behind, although, as ever, there was a threat. “I stop if the vision of someone is not the same,” Conte said. It is doubtful whether Conte’s future beyond the summer has ever not been a thing since his arrival at Spurs last November. He is contracted to June 2023, albeit there is an option to extend. But what happens next with Kane is set to be debated with increasing ferocity. The questions will not go away, even if Spurs have shown that, with Kane’s years of contract working on their side, they will not be pushed around. There is the sense that Kane may have missed the boat with City. They are resolved to sign a centre-forward this summer to help Pep Guardiola in what the club expect will be his final season with them; his deal runs out at the end of it. But it would be as much a move for the longer term and the manager after Guardiola, who may rely more on a specialist No 9. Borussia Dortmund’s Erling Haaland – at 21 years old, the coming star – has been linked heavily to City. What about Manchester United, who have Mauricio Pochettino on the shortlist to become their next permanent manager? Pochettino worked productively with Kane when he was in charge at Spurs. Then again United are hardly assured of Champions League football next season. Kane and Conte talked about how they feel that Spurs are getting better, with the former giving plenty of credit to the latter. “I definitely feel like I’m improving and the team is with Antonio,” Kane said. “That motivates you to be even better. Hopefully we can end the season and give the top four a real go.” Then we will see.",Sport/Football,Harry Kane’s Champions League aims loom over Spurs’ summer once again,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/16/harry-kanes-champions-league-aims-loom-over-spurs-summer-once-again
3/16/2022,"On Saturday morning, I woke up in my home in Poland to a call from an unknown number. The woman on the line said she had a message from my mother in Mariupol, and my heart stopped beating for a moment: my mum is alive. Knowing this is my new definition of happiness. For the past seven years I have made sure my mobile ringer is on before going to sleep, a simple rule I follow just in case my mum calls. But since the start of March, there has been no electricity in that city, and I haven’t heard her voice. This call was a true miracle – after 10 long days, to have confirmation that my mum is still alive. The woman read a letter from her describing the situation in the city. A minute was enough to understand that there’s a humanitarian disaster there already, and every hour counts. The information blackout in Mariupol gives them no hope – my mum was begging me to let the world know they have nothing. In that moment I realised how desperate it is: every night sitting in the full darkness, where the only source of light is a flash from bomb or shell, and all the while thinking you are abandoned and forgotten by the world. I last heard from her and others early in the invasion. Few people wanted to risk leaving the city. It takes about 28 hours from Mariupol to Lviv on the train. People felt that the whole country was on fire and the train was too dangerous. On 3 March it was announced that the city was cut off from the world; the railway track had been destroyed in the night. Official evacuation plans were announced on 5 March, but in the time since only a few private cars have managed to leave the city – probably only a few hundred citizens, out of a city of more than 400,000 people. Now that the city is cut off, the shortages are horrible – electricity, water, gas, the mobile network. Every day something becomes unavailable. Grocery stores turned cash-only but still quickly ran out of stock. In every war there are looters, and desperate hungry people who have lost their human side through fear are emptying and destroying shops across the city. You hear of people taking wooden furniture to make fires. There really were people cooking over these fires, or melting snow to get water. But this wasn’t widespread or long-lasting. Mainly it is too risky to be outside. Air attacks are constant – the city doesn’t have the same air defences as Kyiv. The few bomb shelters available are packed with people. There are firefights in the street. It can be cold at night, -8C (17.6F), and with heating and medical care unavailable, anything that befalls a person could kill – slower than the bombs, but just as surely. The main cemetery is located outside the city in a small village – it’s impossible to get there now. This is why people are buried in their own yards, or in mass graves. The city administration has informed people that they do not identify bodies in these graves. That is my newest fear: not just to lose someone I love, but not even to be able to cry at their grave. The president has said a convoy of aid could reach the city today. But simple math shows that 100 tonnes of aid works out to just about 300 grams per person. Is it enough? Will it reach people who are terrified in basements, who haven’t seen sunlight for days? People are still praying for the convoy to reach the city so they can be evacuated by its buses. Everyone I know dreams of that miracle. I am afraid to see a picture of the thousands of people left over – to evacuate even a third of the city would take weeks. And for thousands, the question is whether they can go or not. Many have lost their homes and belongings; many have nowhere they could go. Since 2014, Mariupol – which is in eastern Ukraine in the Donetsk region – has been the city that resisted. It built connections to the wider world and blossomed: new roads, a restored city centre, modernised hospitals, big festivals. It looked like a new chapter in our history. When I was last there in October 2021, it was modern, clean. I went to the pier and watched the seagulls blow like so many kites in the wind. It reminded me how I told my friends in Poland about the city: a place where the trollybus can take you down to the beach, and the water is warm like milk. After all the heartbreaking stories and all the pain Mariupol is going through, my biggest dream is to witness the day it can be that other city again. I hoped to see my mum there in May of this year and take her to the pier. I still hope to make that happen. Gordana Krutii is originally from Mariupol.

3/16/2022,"Global powers have inched closer to an agreement to waive patents for Covid-19 vaccines, a move that would allow for cheaper generic versions to be manufactured and distributed among developing nations faster. A leaked document, seen by the Guardian, reveals details of a compromise struck between the United States, the European Union, India and South Africa that would end a deadlock over an intellectual property waiver, 18 months after the proposal was first taken to the World Trade Organization. The document detailing the compromise position suggests the negotiated form of the waiver has veered substantially away from the initial proposal first raised by India and South Africa in October 2020, which sought to suspend patents for successful Covid vaccines, treatments and diagnostics – invented by pharmaceutical giants such as Pfizer and Moderna – for the duration of the pandemic. The document details a tentative proposal that would still need final agreement from the four negotiators, as well as from all WTO member nations, to be passed. If passed, the compromised version of the waiver will see only patents for Covid-19 vaccines suspended for either three or five years, and means that treatment and testing formulas will still be subject to intellectual property protections. It would only apply to developing WTO member countries that exported less than 10% of world exports of Covid-19 vaccine doses in 2021, and for those countries would include ingredients and processes necessary for the vaccines’ manufacturing. Additionally, it does not cover technology transfer and trade secrets – something that human rights and development advocates believe will slow down developing nations’ vaccine production. The leaked draft of the agreement states that, if passed at the WTO, member nations will discuss extending the intellectual property waiver to testing and treatment technologies in six months’ time. Because of the WTO’s consensus-based system, as opposed to a majority voting system, one dissenting vote can bring down a proposal. More than 100 mostly lower and middle income nations initially supported the proposal put by India and South Africa. The EU has been one of the last holdouts not to back the plan, while the US shifted its position in May to support waiving patents for vaccines only. Several wealthier nations that had not earlier expressed support for the waiver, including New Zealand and Australia, followed the US shift. Earlier, the US Trade Representative Office spokesperson, Adam Hodge, said that informal discussions between the US, EU, India and South Africa had led to the compromise. “The difficult and protracted process has resulted in a compromise outcome that offers the most promising path toward achieving a concrete and meaningful outcome,” Hodge said. Human rights groups have cautiously welcomed news of the compromise but have expressed disappointment that the negotiated position does not include treatments and diagnostic technologies. Australian Fair Trade & Investment Network convener, Dr Patricia Ranald, welcomed “the admission that WTO rules need to change”. “But these are baby steps which still protect the interests of pharmaceutical companies rather than saving lives. Three million have died since the Omicron variant, and millions more will die unless the Australian and other governments insist on a full waiver for vaccines, tests and treatments,” Ranald said. Amnesty International Australia’s Ry Atkinson said “this compromise is an acknowledgment that business as usual isn’t going to get us out of this crisis”. However, Atkinson said “the reality is that it [the negotiated proposal] doesn’t go far enough”. “We need a waiver that includes technology transfers and treatments, as the co-sponsors of the original waiver intended. Governments advocating for anything less are selling the world short,” he said. Last week, an open letter signed by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the actor Charlize Theron and the former British prime minister Gordon Brown singled out the UK, EU and Switzerland for continuing to block the waiver on lifting intellectual property rules. About 4% of people in low-income countries have had two vaccine doses, according to Amnesty International. The World Health Organization director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has previously labelled vaccine licensing rules and distribution limits a “catastrophic moral failure”. Several pharmaceutical companies across the world which have expressed an interest in making Covid-19 vaccines have cited production permission as a barrier.",News/Society,Global powers inch closer to agreement to waive Covid vaccine patents,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/16/global-powers-inch-closer-to-agreement-to-waive-covid-vaccine-patents
3/16/2022,"The lawsuit that led to the high court ruling that publishers could be held liable for allegedly defamatory comments on their social media pages has been settled, leaving key legal questions unresolved. Dylan Voller had sued the Sydney Morning Herald, the Australian, the Centralian Advocate, Sky News Australia and the Bolt Report over allegedly defamatory third party comments on their Facebook pages. The comments were in response to articles about Voller, whose mistreatment in the Northern Territory’s Don Dale youth detention centre led to a royal commission. Guardian Australia has confirmed with Voller’s lawyers and Nine that the case was settled last week. The terms of the settlement have not been disclosed. The high court judgment on a preliminary question in the case, handed down in September, found the media outlets could be held liable for comments by third parties on their Facebook pages. The judgment sent shockwaves through media companies in Australia, some of which responded by dedicating more resources for comment moderation on social media, or simply shut off their comments on some posts. CNN pulled its Facebook presence from Australia as a result. The Tasmanian premier, Peter Gutwein, also announced he would shut off comments for some posts on Facebook as a result of the hearing. The High Court case was concerned only with whether the media companies could legally be held liable as publishers and the case was sent back to the lower court where the companies could have sought to mount defences to the publication including innocent dissemination. While Voller’s case has been settled, the high court ruling on liability for third-party comments stands. High-profile defamation lawyer Sue Chrysanthou revealed the Voller case had been settled on Tuesday during a Senate committee hearing on the government’s proposed Social Media (Anti-Trolling) bill. Chrysanthou said the outcome meant it was now impossible to know if the media companies could have won the case based on their defences in the supreme court. “The only question in the high court was whether the media organisations were publishers. They possibly still could have won that case if they demonstrated that their publication was innocent.” The bill, introduced in response to the September high court ruling, would shift liability from page owners to the social media platforms if those platforms do not assist those who have alleged to have been defamed to unmask anonymous commenters. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Chrysanthou described the proposed bill as “misconceived” and said it should be redrafted. “This bill is a violent assault on the tort of defamation by the commonwealth, for which no rational basis or reason has been provided,” she said. She said the bill is “providing immunity to large corporations that make money hosting forums where defamatory publications are made”. “These corporations do not need immunity. Just as with the local bird watching group, they can make a choice when it comes to the ongoing publication of defamatory material,” she said. “If they take it down after being put on notice, then they retain their innocent dissemination defences. If they choose to leave it up, then they are held accountable as they should be.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app Over the course of the two hearings held by the Senate committee in the past week, most speakers have argued against the bill, stating it has nothing to do with cracking down on online trolling, and separately that the bill could ultimately make defamation cases more expensive with worse outcomes for those allegedly defamed. The Law Council of Australia has argued that changes should be reserved for outcomes of the working group of the attorneys general, to ensure legislation is the same across the federal, state and territory jurisdictions and not piecemeal. High-profile victims of online trolling Erin Molan and Nyadol Nyuon have also told the inquiry that defamation action was not feasible for most people due to the cost involved of mounting a legal case. Chrysanthou said the proposed bill would make the situation worse for people because with a shield from liability, page owners would no longer face defamation risk for refusing to remove defamatory comments, and the platforms would also have a defence if they ask the anonymous user to hand over their information even if they refuse. It would mean ultimately the comment would stay up unless the commenter decides to delete it.",News/Media,Dylan Voller defamation case settlement leaves legal questions unresolved,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/16/dylan-voller-defamation-case-settlement-leaves-legal-questions-unresolved
3/16/2022,"I’m hitting a brick wall with TNT’s passport delivery service. I was informed by HM Passport Office three months ago that my replacement passport had been dispatched. Since then, there’s been no attempt at a delivery. TNT’s customer service is fully automated and every time I call it informs me that the consignment is out for delivery “tomorrow”. There’s no option to speak to a human. The Passport Office says it’s unable to act unless TNT confirms it’s lost the passport. I have a trip to Italy booked for next month and face losing my money if I am unable to travel.JG, Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire Thousands have taken to Twitter and review websites to complain after waiting in vain for passports and residency permits. The Passport Office says that waiting times are currently about 10 weeks, but that’s for the document to be issued. Some complainants claim to have been waiting more than six months for TNT to make it to their door. The US-owned company, part of FedEx, signed a £77m three-year contract with the Home Office to deliver official travel documents in 2019, but Brexit and Covid appear to have wrought havoc. There are also concerns that the service does not allow recipients to live-track their item or log delivery instructions. A petition on Change.org, signed by more than 700 people, is calling for an inquiry into how TNT was selected by the Home Office and why service failings have not been investigated. SDD contacted me from Hampshire after his spouse visa was delivered to the wrong address without a signature, despite government rules requiring residency permits to be handed over in person after identity verification. The visa was reissued and delivered to the correct address, but again without being handed over in person. Londoner VH says that TNT erroneously claimed he was out on four occasions when it tried to deliver his biometric residency permit. “I checked my CCTV for the dates and times of the attempted deliveries shown on TNT’s tracker,” he says. “On the first occasion, the driver approached the property, took a photo and drove off without ringing the bell. The other times they didn’t even do that.” JG was contacted by TNT the day I alerted its press office, and his passport was miraculously discovered and delivered within 24 hours. TNT has apologised and blamed a surge in passport applications after Covid restrictions were eased at the end of last year. “This regrettably impacted our service levels,” it says. “We took a number of actions to restore service levels across our HM Passport Office network – including operational resources, extra team support and additional customer support resources – and we are currently operating within the service level requirements agreed with the Home Office.” TNT did not comment on allegations that drivers attempt deliveries without ringing the door bell, or that its helpline is unhelpful. Surprisingly, the Passport Office told me that, unlike with residency permits, a signature for passport deliveries is not part of its “secure delivery requirements” unless the mail box is communal. It would not specify what these “secure delivery requirements” are, or comment on whether it plans to renew the contract with TNT when it expires in July. It says: “We work closely with our UK delivery supplier and passports are being delivered within the required service level of 48 hours for standard deliveries.” Email your.problems@observer.co.uk.

3/16/2022,"In one room, tiny sheep tiptoe above a bunk bed and there are hoof-prints across the cement floor. In the room next door, carrier bags have been twisted into a light fixture in the fashion of a Hindu flower garland. Down the hall, lost mementoes including holiday postcards, bingo tickets and grainy photos decorate a glitter- and confetti-strewn resin floor. Welcome to what is claimed to be the UK’s first Art Hostel – a social enterprise project that has given artists free rein to design every inch of its premises from the ground up, in an effort to showcase grassroots creative talent from the UK and abroad. It’s the brainchild of East Street Arts, a charitable organisation that works with artists and residents in local communities. And the hostel isn’t in a hip enclave of east London, as you might expect, but in a deprived central suburb of Leeds. While there are several art-led hostels and hotels in Europe, and the legendary Carlton Arms art hotel in New York, this is the first in the UK to actually make the spaces themselves function as works of art. And the result is nothing less than magical – a symphony of imagination let loose on a grand scale. The hostel’s blank canvas is a building completed in 1894 that was once the presbytery for the old St Patrick’s church in Leeds’ Mabgate area. (The church itself is today used for storage by Opera North and Leeds Playhouse.) There are 12 rooms, each one grappling creatively with themes such as politics, history, environmental commentary and nostalgia. Staying the night here is like wandering through a dream. Given the freedom of the empty hostel as it prepared to open, I sneak into The Common(ing) (room 8) and wind up the handmade music box to hear it sing. I squint at the marine pollution maps created out of photos of washed-up footballs in Ocean Galaxy (room 6). I lie on the floor to take in the full glory of the interlocking fabric ceiling in The Wooly Ewe (room 9), which pays homage to sheep as a symbol of Leeds’ wool manufacturing heritage. The Art Hostel represents all that is shining in the Leeds creative scene right now, where grassroots organisations and entrepreneurs are passionate about creating a leading centre for the arts in the north of England. Profits from the hostel will be used to support other East Street Arts projects, in Leeds and beyond. “For the original 17 commissions available we had 218 applicants, and all of them were really great. It blew us away,” says Art Hostel general manager Rhian Aitken. In the end, they settled on 20, which included all the bedrooms, the kitchen, a commission for the volunteer staff quarters, a film-making project for the central stairwell and a motion-sensor-driven installation with reclaimed car headlights that mimics the sounds of insects climbing a wall. The Art Hostel started life as a pop-up on Kirkgate in 2016. Curious to see if such a concept could take off, East Street Arts initially intended to run the hostel for three years as an experiment. A disagreement with its landlord forced the hostel to close its doors in 2018. But in fewer than three years of operation it had taken 10,000 bookings. The business model had been vindicated, the travel demand was there, and so East Street Arts was encouraged to seek a forever home for the hostel. That was in 2019, but Brexit-related delays thwarted progress, and then Covid hit. Only recently, at the end of February 2022, has the Art Hostel finally managed to open. Recycling and ecology are at the heart of the project. “A lot of the old hostel stuff has been reused and recycled,” says Aitken. “One of the rooms is completely made from reclaimed wood, and even the flooring in the lounge and some of the bedrooms comes from a gym in Poland.” There’s also hot composting and a wormery; butts to conserve water; a landscaped garden designed to reduce traffic noise (the hostel is right next to the A64 ring road) and eco-friendly Earthborn Claypaints are used throughout. The fact that the hostel has found a permanent home in Mabgate makes perfect sense. This neighbourhood rubs shoulders with the Leeds Playhouse, BBC Radio offices and the Northern Ballet headquarters. And next door there’s East Street Arts’ Convention House, which started life as a nunnery but is now a multipurpose creative space with studios, residency accommodation for artists, and tech facilities including an ecological darkroom that acts as a research facility for sustainable photography practices. “For a lot of years there wasn’t any funding [for the arts],” says Aitken. “So Karen Watson and Jon Wakeman [East Street Arts’ founders] got together and created a space with a communal area, so everyone could get together, show work and mix with each other, and have that social aspect as well as having their own studios. And that was unique.” Aitken says the reason East Street Arts and the Art Hostel have flourished is because of the Leeds “DIY attitude” to the arts. “This whole area has become a community hub for creatives,” says Aitken. Down the road there are now photo labs and more art and dance studios. At the bottom of the hill there’s MAP (Music and Arts Production) Charity, an alternative education provider working with young people who are unable to access mainstream schooling. “Mabgate and Lincoln Green was one of the most deprived areas in Europe at one point. But it’s got this wonderfully diverse community,” says Aitken. East Street Arts is now involved in creating an artist-led community neighbourhood plan for Mabgate, which will be the first of its kind in the country. The plan will help give local residents, businesses, schools, community groups and charities a say in how the area develops and regenerates – with a dose of creative input. “It’s not about gentrification. It’s not about the artists coming in and making things pretty; it’s about actually giving the people a voice and helping them make decisions about what’s happening to them and their families,” she says. And the hostel itself is also a community effort: one of the rooms, the Ziggy Wingle (room 2), was a collaboration between Leeds artist Alison Smith and local Shakespeare Primary School, resulting in splashes of primary colours, children’s drawings embedded in the window architraves and a huge, playful wall of movable parts. Plans are already afoot to take the Art Hostel concept to other cities in the UK. “There are lots of emerging artists, but also lots of jobbing artists who are there every day just doing their thing, making their creative lives, and it’s great that we can feature them and give them the opportunity to do something really, really visual,” says Aitken.

3/16/2022,"Are you sitting comfortably? Then we’ll begin. Once upon a time there was a harried new parent (me, I’m talking about me) who sat down and read her baby a book. Then she read the baby another book and then she read the baby another book etc, etc. That’s what you’re supposed to do when you have a kid, isn’t it? You read them books so they can develop a passion for literature and grow up to have an impecunious future in the arts. As far as I can tell, my 10-month-old hasn’t developed a passion for literature yet. Unless you count putting books in her mouth, squealing, and then throwing them across the room as a “passion”. But I’ve certainly learned a lot from all this new reading material. And, because sharing is caring (a big theme in kids’ books), I’m going to share these learnings with you. Number one: it’s time we had a serious conversation about Dear Zoo. Everyone loves this classic baby book – we were gifted FIVE copies of it – but the central theme is disturbing. A small child keeps sending animals back to the zoo because they’re not quite up to snuff? I’m sorry, but I strongly suspect that book helped raise a generation of Karens of all genders. It might as well be called Dear Zoo (I Want To Speak To The Manager). My second big learning is that celebrities really need to stop writing kids’ books. By my calculations, 93.2% of celebrities, from Whoopi Goldberg to Chelsea Clinton to Jimmy Fallon to George Galloway(!!) to Kelly Clarkson to Mike Pence’s rabbit have authored a kids’ book. Most of these are either terrible or terribly unimaginative. Here, for example, is a sample quote from one of Fallon’s creations: “This is baby’s nose, these are baby’s fingers, these are baby’s toes.” Must be nice to be famous! You can get paid a gazillion bucks to rhyme nose with toes. I guess that’s just how it goes. Money makes money; when you’re rich, you keep stacking up the zeros. (Where’s my book contract, eh?). Which moves me on to my final learning: everyone seems to think they can write a great kids’ book, but very few people actually can.

3/16/2022,"Australian researchers claim to have made a “giant leap” in lifting the efficiency of electrolysers, bringing forward the time when green hydrogen will be competitive with fossil fuels as an energy source. Hysata, a company using technology developed at the University of Wollongong, said its patented capillary-fed electrolysis cells achieve 95% efficiency, meaning little wastage, beating by about one-quarter the levels of current technology. The achievement, published in the peer-reviewed Nature Communication journal today, could see the Morrison government’s so-called hydrogen stretch goal of $2 a kilogram to make the fuel competitive reached as soon as 2025, the Hysata chief executive, Paul Barrett, said. “We’ve gone from 75% [efficiency] to 95% – it’s really a giant leap for the electrolysis industry,” Barrett said. Renewable energy from sources such as wind and solar is making big inroads into the power sector, supplying more than a third of eastern Australia’s electricity in the final three months of 2021. However, decarbonising industry and some transport, such as trucking, is likely to be tougher unless fuels such as hydrogen become much cheaper. Gerry Swiegers, Hysata’s chief technology officer and a UoW professor, said electrolysis – which uses electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen – had been around for two centuries with mostly only incremental improvements in processing. The central challenge was to reduce the electrical resistance within the electrolysis cell. Much like a smart phone battery warming as it charges, resistance wasted energy in a regular cell as well as often requiring additional energy for cooling. “What we did differently was just to start completely over and to think about it from a very high level,” Swiegers said. “Everyone else was looking at improving materials or an existing design.” With the help of two PhD researchers – Aaron Hodges and Anh Linh Hoang – the small team used readily available materials to develop a thin sponge-like membrane to suck the water up between two electrodes. The avoidance of creating bubbles was also key. “So a combination of that wicking membrane and that bubble-free operation resulted in inherently low resistance,” Barrett said. Hydrogen could be produced using 41.5 kilowatt-hours of electricity per kilogram. “For hydrogen producers, this will significantly reduce both the capital and operational costs to produce green hydrogen,” he said, adding the efficiency levels achieved were “the best in the world”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning From an initial concept in 2019, the research has advanced quickly. With $4.25m from UK-based IP Group and $750,000 from Australia’s Clean Energy Finance Corp, Hysata is now looking to begin a pilot manufacturing site of electrolysis plates – each 250mm in diameter – by the end of 2023. “We want to help Australia build core electrolyser technology,” Barrett said, adding the plan would be to build a plant capable of producing one gigawatt of electrolysers a year. Similar-sized plants for elsewhere in the country and beyond would follow as the production techniques were mastered. Hysata is hiring more staff to add to its 20-strong team, with a plan for a fundraising announcement in the second half of 2022, Barrett said.

3/16/2022,"The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has taken a swing at Rupert Murdoch’s national broadsheet the Australian, declaring it is “extraordinarily disrespectful” to use the appellation “mean girls” to describe “strong, articulate, principled women” like Penny Wong, Katy Gallagher and Kristina Keneally. The blast followed the publication on Wednesday of an article chronicling alleged internal disagreements between members of Labor’s Senate team and the late senator Kimberley Kitching, who died suddenly of a heart attack last week at the age of 52. The article claimed the disagreements left Kitching feeling isolated. The news story was headlined: “How Labor’s ‘mean girls’ ostracised Kimberley Kitching”. It appears to attribute the “mean girls” reference either to Kitching directly, or one of her friends. Wednesday’s report asserts that Kitching “and some of her supporters” referred to Gallagher, Keneally and Wong as “the mean girls”. Albanese told journalists in Brisbane he found it “astonishing” and a decades-long “throwback” that a sexist description would be deployed in 2022 to describe female frontbenchers. The federal opposition leader noted he was campaigning in Queensland on Wednesday with colleagues Ed Husic and Anthony Chisholm and “we have never been described as mean boys, and people should think about that”. Albanese said on Wednesday his colleagues were still mourning Kitching’s “tragic loss.” “It was sudden,” he said. “It was not expected. Her funeral isn’t until Monday. Can people be a bit respectful at this point in time?” Asked whether there was cause to investigate whether or not the Labor party had a “mean girls” culture, Albanese said: “Seriously, have a bit of respect. The funeral is on Monday”. Kitching – a player in Labor’s Victorian right faction, and a long time friend and factional ally of Labor’s former leader, Bill Shorten – was facing a battle to secure preselection to remain in the Senate at the coming election. Because of an extraordinary federal intervention in the Victorian branch of the Labor party, triggered by a significant branch stacking scandal, preselections in the state were being determined by the national executive. Speaking after Kitching’s death, Shorten said the senator had been under considerable stress. “I’m not a coroner, I can’t tell you why this woman at 52 was taken from us, but I have no doubt the stress of politics and the machinations in the back rooms had its toll,” he said last week. “She’s a very strong person. She could give as good as she could get. But you take it all home with you, don’t you? Stress is like invisible coats of paint. It’s got to be having its impact. And she was greatly stressed.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Wong, Keneally and Gallagher are all significant supporters of Albanese. Albanese said on Wednesday Kitching was “someone who I had respect for”. He said he had appointed her as an assistant shadow minister, assisting Shorten in the shadow portfolio of disabilities. “She worked closely with Bill and I thought that was entirely appropriate”. Wong, Labor’s Senate leader, told journalists: “Senator Kitching has passed away and that was tragic and shocking and many in the Labor family are grieving and her loved ones are grieving”. “I am simply not going to engage in commentary about some of the allegations which have been raised and even if I and others disagree with them”. Gallagher told the ABC: “Many of the assertions in that article are not true from my point of view, but I don’t think it is respectful for us to enter into commentary or disagreements about particular aspects of [the story] at this point in time”. Campaigning in Perth, Scott Morrison told reporters Kitching was “unique” and a “true patriot” who had forged many friendships with Liberal colleagues in the pursuit of her policy interests in foreign affairs, defence and intelligence. Morrison said he was not in a position to confirm the report in The Australian, but he said he expected Albanese to take any claims of internal strong-arming “seriously”.",News/Australia news,‘Extraordinarily disrespectful’: Albanese hits back after Labor senators dubbed ‘mean girls’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/16/extraordinarily-disrespectful-albanese-hits-back-after-labor-senators-dubbed-mean-girls
3/16/2022,"Good Wednesday morning to you from me, Warren Murray. The US Senate has passed a unanimous resolution condemning Vladimir Putin as a war criminal – a rare show of unity in the deeply divided congress – as the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the Russian side were sounding “more realistic” in negotiations to end the war. Talks are set to resume via video link today. Earlier, Zelenskiy acknowledged that Ukraine would not become a Nato member, in a significant concession. As the war approaches its third week, heavy shelling of Ukraine’s cities has continued. The Ukraine ministry of defence said the “worst situation remains in the area of Mariupol, where the opponent tries to block the city in the western and eastern outskirts of the city”. There have been reports of Russian troops seizing a hospital in Mariupol and taking about 500 people hostage. Leaders of three European Union countries – Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia – met with Zelenskiy in Kyiv on Tuesday, arriving by train in a bold show of support amid the danger. The Czech prime minister, Petr Fiala, told Ukrainians: “Europe stands with you … The main goal of our visit and the main message of our mission is to say to our Ukrainian friends that they are not alone.” The leader of Poland’s ruling party, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, said an international peacekeeping mission should be sent to operate in Ukraine. Joe Biden has signed off on $13.6bn in US aid and Zelenskiy is due to address the US Congress today. Meanwhile Nato commanders will be meeting in Brussels where they are expected to draw up plans for new ways to deter Russia, including more troops and missile defences in eastern Europe. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, is expected to plead for more weapons from individual Nato countries. Keep up with further developments at our live blog. Arbiter end – Silicon Valley executives will no longer be the “supreme arbiters” of online speech, according to the culture secretary. Nadine Dorries said “unelected” tech leaders had become some of the most powerful people in the world due to a lack of robust regulation, which would change under the revised online safety bill to be published on Thursday. It requires platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and TikTok to prevent proliferation of illegal content such as child sexual abuse and terrorist material; and mandates the biggest tech firms to protect adults from legal but harmful content, such as cyberbullying. Social media platforms face hefty fines for breaches. There are protections for journalistic content and content of “democratic importance”. Dorries said: “We would never pursue legislation that threatens freedom of expression … nor can we maintain the current status quo, where a handful of west coast execs are the supreme arbiters of online speech.” Midweek catch-up > Hopes are high that British-Iranian dual nationals Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori could be freed and allowed to return to London within days under a deal in which the UK agrees to repay a £400m debt and release an Iranian prisoner. > Few teachers are aware that equalities legislation applies to their school’s policies on hair, despite high-profile court cases affecting black students who have been penalised or excluded for their hairstyles, a survey has found. > Spain’s Nuclear Safety Council (CSN) has appealed for people to be on the lookout for a soil-testing kit containing radioactive material that was stolen from a van in the Madrid region. > New Zealand is reopening its borders.

Here is this year’s shortlist. ‘Truly regrettable’ – A black girl of 15 was strip-searched by police at school in a procedure that involved exposure of intimate body parts, according to an official investigation that found racism likely to have influenced officers’ actions. The child is now in therapy and self-harming, according to family members’ statements. Details of her treatment emerged in a review initiated by Hackney council after the incident in December 2020. Police had been called by teachers who told the review they believed she was smelling strongly of cannabis and suspected she was carrying drugs. None were found during the subsequent search. The Metropolitan police has apologised for what a senior officer described as “truly regrettable” treatment. A separate Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) report is nearing completion. Tomb find – Several tombs and a leaden sarcophagus likely dating from the 14th century have been uncovered by archaeologists at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris as reconstruction continues after its devastating 2019 fire. It is thought the coffin was made for a senior dignitary in the 1300s – the century after the cathedral’s construction. The team used a mini endoscopic camera to look inside: “You can glimpse pieces of fabric, hair and a pillow of leaves on top of the head, a well known phenomenon when religious leaders were buried,” said Christophe Besnier, the lead archaeologist. “The fact that these plant elements are still inside means the body is in a very good state of conservation.” When Roman Abramovich bought Chelsea in 2003, he transformed the club’s fortunes and ushered in a new era of billionaire owners in the Premier League. But as David Conn explains, the issues that led to sanctions being imposed on him last week by the government have been in plain view for years.

Now, for many, the war in Ukraine has brought back that sense of dread. By Zoe Williams. A revitalised England were set 135 to beat India and secure their first victory of the Women’s World Cup in New Zealand. Ralf Rangnick said the referee’s failure to award a free-kick in the buildup to Atlético Madrid’s winner was decisive as Manchester United were knocked out of the Champions League last 16 in a match that shone a light on the team’s also-ran status. Chelsea have withdrawn a request for Saturday’s FA Cup quarter-final at Middlesbrough to be played behind closed doors after causing exasperation and disbelief in the sport and in Downing Street with their desperate push for permission to sell tickets. The roar of 70,000 horse racing fans was a welcome noise on the first day of a Cheltenham Festival crowned by Honeysuckle’s repeat victory in the Champion Hurdle. England have been preparing for Saturday’s final Six Nations match, against France, by perfecting their chop tackles to avoid another nightmare red-card scenario in Paris. Harriet Dart’s surprise breakthrough run to the second week of the BNP Paribas Open came to an end in the fourth round at Indian Wells with a heavy defeat against a searing Madison Keys. And Lancashire fast bowler Saqib Mahmood will make a highly anticipated debut for England when the second Test against West Indies gets under way on Wednesday. The US Federal Reserve is expected today to raise interest rates for the first time since 2018, adding a quarter of a percentage point in line with actions by its peers including the Bank of England to combat inflation, the impact of the war in Ukraine, and the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Asian share markets have been on the rise today in anticipation of the Fed’s decision. A bounce in the FTSE can be expected as well, while sterling is worth $1.304 and €1.190 at time of writing. Today’s Guardian print edition leads with “Ukraine’s Nato concession as airstrikes batter capital” – the front-page picture slot goes to hopes that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe may be about to be freed. The i has “Putin turns to Plan C”, saying the Russian ruler is on the brink of waging a “war of attrition” with long-range bombing of cities and infrastructure, and expanding the war into Ukraine’s west. “Zelenskiy – we can’t join Nato” – that’s the Times while the Daily Express calls Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s comments a “glimmer of hope for peace”. The Telegraph takes it a semantic step further, adjudging Zelenskiy to have accepted that Ukraine can “never” join Nato. “A city of fear and defiance” – the Daily Mail delivers reportage from Kyiv. The Financial Times says “West turns up heat on Moscow with moves against oligarchs and military”. The Metro sports colourful phrasing regarding mounting sanctions against Abramovich and his ilk: “Oli lolly crackdown … You’re not blinging anymore”. And Woody Johnson, former US ambassador to the UK, is making a £2bn “swoop” for Chelsea, according to the Sun.

3/16/2022,"Across the years of 1983 and 84, I thought every plane going over my head contained a nuclear bomb that would be dropped, or not dropped, according to the mood of the pilot. It was an absolutely pure terror, a literal chill darting around my body, from my heart to the balls of my feet. Last week, due to the war in Ukraine, I felt that same freezing feeling for the first time in almost 40 years. The first time, I would have been about 10. Thanks to Raymond Briggs’s When the Wind Blows, the brutal 1984 apocalypse drama Threads and various clergymen-orators at CND marches, I knew a huge amount about the impact of a nuclear blast. I was all over the skin peeling, the radiation sickness, the nuclear winter, the relative horrors of being at the centre of the blast radius (ideal) or on its outer edges (you would limp on for a few weeks with your teeth falling out of your gums, creeping toward death). But I didn’t have a clue about the nuts and bolts of the matter – the fact that a nuclear war would probably be preceded by at least a small amount of conventional war, and even then, commercial airlines wouldn’t be equipped with warheads. Hilary Wainwright, a sociologist, activist and the co-editor of the socialist magazine Red Pepper, remembers her similar anxiety in the early 60s – vivid but impractical. “I was camping out in the garden at home, sleeping in this tent, I must have been eight years old, and saying, ‘I think we’d better go in, there might be a nuclear war.’ This would have been the Bay of Pigs.” That tussle for Cuba, between the US and the USSR, flourished into the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 – during which time it was quite reasonable to go to bed at night wondering if you’d see the morning. The author Michael Rosen recalls his father having anxiety dreams and that he’d woken in the night, thought the room was 45 degrees and that nuclear war had already started. Also around that time, it was commonly believed that the world had come quite close to nuclear annihilation – and this was borne out by documents released later, remembers Tariq Ali, an activist and historian. “The Cuban leadership was in a slightly crazed, ultra-left state,” he says. “When Nikita Khrushchev [the USSR’s first secretary] informed them he was going to stop the ships and withdraw the missiles, both Fidel [Castro] and Che [Guevara] said, ‘What’s it to you? Wouldn’t it be a great gain for the world? We’re prepared to sacrifice our tiny island of Cuba if it will destroy the US.’” While the cold war and the nuclear threat were very real in the 80s, very few people alive in 1962 remember that decade with anything like the same fear. “We were so terrified in 62,” says Rosen. “You just get anxiety fatigue.” The psychotherapist and author Julia Bueno, who is in her late-40s and remembers seeing When the Wind Blows in the cinema, explains why: “As a general rule, if you’ve been through a trauma, it leaves an imprint. I’ve had conversations with people around the same age as me. It’s made a lot of us a bit robust in the current situation, a bit ‘been-there-done-that’. I have spoken to people in their late 30s, who didn’t go through that, and they are so depleted and anxious, and untethered.” That resilience was hard won. If the cold war ramping up with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan on Christmas Eve 1979 was your first introduction to the nuclear prospect, the decade that followed was absolutely petrifying. Stephen Brotherstone and David Lawrence have co-authored a series of books called Scarred for Life. Volume three, Pop Culture in the Shadow of the Bomb, is out next month. “I remember that Afghanistan invasion – I was 10,” says Brotherstone. “I didn’t know what it meant, but I saw what it meant to my mum – she started crying. After that, there was this revolving door of Russian premiers, all of whom seemed mad. It was the Reagan era of tough-guy politics. By 83 and 84, it felt that nuclear war was going to happen. Not could happen, but was going to.” The academic and activist Mary Kaldor was a towering figure in the British peace movement and one of the founders of End (the campaign for European Nuclear Disarmament). “What I think is really weird about nuclear weapons is that we go through phases of worrying about them intensely, and then we can’t bear to think about it any more, so we just stop,” she says. That cycle has been there since the invention of the bomb and the second-world-war-ending first deployment in Japan. There have been times when the threat completely eroded popular trust in government, and the fear permeated everything, from civil society to culture. In the 50s and 60s, being a peacenik didn’t disbar you from the mainstream; there was a folk troubadour tradition, embodied by the likes of Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan. But active anti-death proselytising was considered subversive and niche – Pete Seeger and the Weavers ended up disbanding after they were brought in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee in the US. Essentially, as far as the US was concerned, not wanting to be annihilated made you a communist (although, to be fair, they were pinko-adjacent). In the 80s, however, there were pop songs, comedy sketches and even board games about nuclear war. Brotherstone and Lawrence have made an apocalypse Top 10, whittled down from 100 chart-toppers about the bomb. “Strawberry Switchblade, a young couple deciding on suicide after a nuclear war,” Lawrence says. “UB40, The Earth Dies Screaming,” Brotherstone adds, “David Bowie, Eve of Destruction, a song from the second-most depressing film of all time, When the Wind Blows. Ultravox, Dancing With Tears in My Eyes – the video is about him rushing home to be with his wife and kid before they’re vaporised.” “The Specials, of course,” Lawrence adds, “with Man at C&A” (this begins with the line, “Warning, warning, nuclear attack”). “Men at Work did a song about a lower-ranking army offer and his nuclear anxiety, and accidental nuclear attack,” Lawrence continues. Brotherstone adds, “I only found out recently that in Nik Kershaw’s I Won’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me, the sun he refers to is the flash of the mushroom cloud. Then Kate Bush did a song about an unborn child’s thoughts as it floats in its mother’s womb, wondering whether it’s going to be born into a world of radiation and death.” In with a bullet at No 1: Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Two Tribes. It’s video is a parody of the Protect and Survive public information campaign. The writer Charlie Brooker was an absolutely top-tier nuclear neurotic in the 80s, but remembers as a child being comforted that people could laugh at the idea of a nuclear war. “If they’re making jokes about nuclear war on Spitting Image, it’s going to be OK,” he says. That is until he became a satirist himself. “I remember doing the 2016 Screenwipe, after Trump had been elected but before he’d been inaugurated – he started casually talking about a nuclear bomb. I was in the position then that Spitting Image was in when I was a kid – funny and reassuring, saying: ‘It’s all sort of going to be OK.’ But I was shitting myself.” Meanwhile, a brief timeline of civil society: in the 50s, those who opposed nuclear weapons had a huge battle just to get the atrocities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki recognised. Rosen says governments internationally “pretty successfully sat on the effects – the immediate impact and the half-life were concealed by huge effort”. Nuclear testing on Christmas Island, the release of strontium-90 and the possible cancers it could cause, subsequent birth defects across the Polynesian islands, all this information went through a tango of suppression by authorities then awareness-raising by peace activists. Before the Cuban missile crisis, there was also fear a war might be triggered by accident – a flock of geese alerting a missile defence system, or a power station blowing up (given Chernobyl and Three-Mile Island, these hypotheses were ahead of their time). Early peace activists Canon Collins, the first chair of the CND, and Bertrand and Dora Russell were preoccupied by the idea of accidental war. They were part of a drive to disrupt the cosy consensus that a nuclear war couldn’t possibly happen because it would simply be too dreadful. In 1962, however, the phrase “mutually assured destruction” was coined and became military doctrine over that decade – the idea that neither side had the incentive either to escalate or disarm, so holding nuclear weapons was safe, actually. “Before the fully articulated MAD proposal,” Rosen says, “you would get people claiming that we could have a limited nuclear war and win it.” That (completely deranged) idea was given new energy in the Reagan era with the notion of a great nuclear shield, which would allow the US to nuke the USSR without a counterattack (would it shield Europe as well? Not so much). In the UK in the early 60s, a group of august peace activists – the Committee of 100 – uncovered the Regional Seats of Government (RSGs), advanced governmental contingency planning to keep things ticking over in the event of nuclear war. This unleashed a tide of anxiety that didn’t recede until the 90s – a government that was readying itself, with miles of secret underground bunkers, plainly wasn’t trustworthy and possibly didn’t have its citizens’ interests at the heart of its decision-making. In 1980, Protect and Survive emerged, a series of pamphlets, radio scripts and 20 short public information films which were only to be shown if a war was thought likely within the subsequent 72 hours. Of course, they were leaked to the media just after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and they were full of terrifyingly granular details – what a four-minute warning would sound like, which bit of your house would work best as a fallout room, “life under fallout conditions”, and yet they were also kind of nonsensical. In what conceivable world would taking a door off its hinges and leaning it against your dining room table protect you from a nuclear blast? Theories swirled that these were all strategic displacement activities, just to keep people busy so they didn’t rush the politicians’ own bomb shelter network. Details of such doors were published in panicky books such as Beneath the Streets by Peter Laurie in 1979, which identifies secret doors to the RSG tunnels. One of them was on Kingsway, which runs from High Holborn to Aldwych in the centre of London. I remember passing it on a march and someone pointing it out, the portal to the postapocalypse underworld. Trust in political authority was, understandably, low. Unless you were going to go the way of the Swiss – where neutrality was pledged and it had been mandatory since 1963 to have capacity for its entire population in fallout shelters – it’s hard to be open with a population about a plan which will see most of them die. It was difficult to distinguish fact (those bunkers were real) from fiction (were night trains carrying nuclear waste?). But just because you were a conspiracy theorist didn’t mean the government wasn’t out to get you. For a generation, peace marches became a family event. The first of the famous Aldermaston marches took place in 1958, covering a tremendous distance, from Trafalgar Square to the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment about 50 miles away in Berkshire. Rosen “ran away from home to go on the 1960 march, which was a joke, because Mum and Dad were going anyway. My mother, as a good Jewish mother, was saying, ‘You can’t go, you can’t go! Don’t forget the raisins!” Kaldor was on the second march, aged 10: “We went on a lorry that said, ‘we want to live’.” Even those who didn’t attend Aldermaston marches found that they shaped their understanding of collective action and protest: “CND was a formative moment. It shaped a lot of our political awareness,” Wainwright says. “A sense that the world was in a really bad place.” But, she says, “the most important thing was Greenham [this was 1981]. Ordinary – well, extraordinary – women in Cardiff were so worried about nuclear weapons that they decided they couldn’t let it happen. So they marched to [the RAF base in the Berkshire parish of] Greenham, and set up this camp, which then became the most potent focal point, particularly for women in the movement.” It was galvanising for the activists. I went as a kid and found it paralysing. You’d get the bus from Newbury station, and other passengers would be wearing badges saying “RAGE” (Residents Against Greenham Extremists) – I remember a woman with her grey hair in a centre parting staring at me and my sister with naked hatred. Then you’d arrive, and all the talk was of apocalypse. Looking back, the Greenham women were effectively on a domestic strike; some of them brought their kids, most of them didn’t. If they were there, it had to mean something. Nobody was really in the mood for small talk. But the great untold story of the CND, and this is even more true about End, is that it had a seismic impact on policy. Kaldor has told me about a senior figure in the Reagan administration who said they borrowed a disarmament demand from the placards of an End demonstration, because it was so extreme the USSR would have to refuse it: then Gorbachev accepted it, which was the beginning of the end of the cold war. This week, she’s more dispirited: “The American peace movement was very focused on nuclear weapons. We focused on ending the cold war. And in that sense, we were very successful, but maybe we could have pushed further.” Then, as if by magic, the fear vanished. It left no trace as we hurtled into the carefree 90s, because remembering it was just too heavy. By the time Jeremy Corbyn was leader of the Labour party, Kaldor points out we were at the stage of denial where “he was attacked for saying, if he had to press the button, he would think very carefully about it. Apparently you’re not supposed to think very carefully, you’re supposed to just do it.” Yet the weapons never disappeared, and nor did the fear. It all lay dormant, waiting to be poked awake by another madman.",News/World news,"‘By 10, I knew all about the impact of a nuclear blast’: growing up in the shadow of the bomb",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/16/by-10-i-knew-all-about-the-impact-of-a-nuclear-blast-growing-up-in-the-shadow-of-the-bomb
3/16/2022,"Silicon Valley executives will no longer be the “supreme arbiters” of online speech, according to the culture secretary, as the government prepares to publish reformed legislation to tackle online abuse. Nadine Dorries said “unelected” tech leaders had become some of the most powerful people in the world due to a lack of robust regulation, adding that the situation will change under the online safety bill. This imposes a duty of care on tech companies to protect users from harmful content. A revised version will be published on Thursday. “Unelected Silicon Valley execs have become some of the most powerful people in the world,” Dorries wrote in an article on the ConservativeHome website. “They decide who gets to speak online, and who is silenced or cancelled from public life. That prospect should concern anyone who truly cares about free speech.” Dorries said she was responding to criticism from a “group of MPs and journalists” that the bill will give Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg unlimited power to censor online expression. The bill, which focuses on platforms that host user-generated content such as Facebook, Twitter and TikTok, requires companies to prevent the proliferation of illegal content such as child sexual abuse and terrorist material. It also mandates the biggest tech firms to protect adults from legal but harmful content such as cyberbullying. The legal but harmful clause has given rise to concerns that it might result in excessive censorship by social media platforms, which face hefty fines by the communications watchdog, Ofcom, for breaches of the act. Dorries said the bill will have “considerably stronger protections for free speech” when it is published in revised form this week, after the publication of draft legislation last year. Under the bill, journalistic content will be exempt from removal, and content of “democratic importance”, which is partly designed to protect political discourse and expression, will also be protected. “We would never pursue legislation that threatens freedom of expression … nor can we maintain the current status quo, where a handful of west coast execs are the supreme arbiters of online speech,” said Dorries. The government has already announced that the revised bill will include new criminal offences covering cyberflashing, threatening social media posts and the publishing of hoax bomb threats. It will also require that online platforms protect users from fraudulent adverts and will order commercial pornography sites to carry out age checks on people trying to access their content. Privacy campaigners have described the new age-verification policy as a “privacy minefield” and have warned that it could establish the principle of age-gating across the internet.

3/16/2022,"The UK could eliminate all need for imports of Russian gas this year through a combination of energy efficiency, expanding renewable power generation and a campaign to help people change their behaviour, research has found. Information campaigns played a strong role in changing people’s behaviour during the Covid-19 pandemic. Many people are unaware of the savings they could make in energy use through small changes that make no difference to their comfort but can cut bills substantially. For instance, turning down thermostats slightly and adjusting the “flow” temperature on condensing boilers could reduce annual heating bills by more than 15%. The flow temperature governs the heat of water sent to radiators but does not reduce the room temperature, and turning it down could save up to 8% of annual costs, while turning down thermostats could save about 10%. A comfortable room temperature is 18C to 21C, but many people set their thermostats at 22C or above. These measures, along with better insulation, switching to heat pumps and using more energy efficient appliances, could cut imports of Russian gas to the UK by 80% this year and save about £150 on the average household bill, according to the green thinktank E3G. The remaining 20% could be eliminated by generating more power from renewable sources, such as new windfarms and solar panels. Colm Britchfield, researcher at E3G and co-author of the report, said: “With government support, ordinary UK households can play a huge role in cutting Putin out of our energy system.” The shift can be accomplished using existing policies and mechanisms, if they were pursued more thoroughly, the research found. For example, four government initiatives that currently help insulate houses and public buildings – the local authority delivery scheme, home upgrade grant and public sector and social housing decarbonisation funds – are expected to be worth about £3.4bn from 2022 to 2025. E3G suggests that if the local authority delivery scheme alone – which supports the installation of heat pumps and energy efficiency measures for low-income households – was boosted by £1.8bn, it could cover 120,000 to 180,000 of the UK’s coldest homes. E3G’s researchers only looked at gas use, but any public information campaign could also target petrol and diesel use, as better driving habits can make a substantial difference to fuel costs. Russia is a minor supplier of gas to the UK, making up only about 3% of the market, as most of Britain’s supply comes from the North Sea and Norway, but reducing imports could help with the global effort to put pressure on Vladimir Putin. Cutting gas use would also ease the cost of living crisis amid soaring fossil fuel prices. The government is working on the final details of a new energy security strategy, to be unveiled soon, that will boost renewable energy generation and could make planning permission for windfarms easier to obtain. Separately, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, will set out measures to ease the cost of living in a spring statement next Wednesday. On Monday, a group of 33 charities, thinktanks and civil society groups wrote to Boris Johnson, Sunak and the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, to call for £3.6bn for insulation grants for all households, and an extra £4bn by 2025 to install heat pumps in place of gas boilers. A government spokesperson said: “We recognise people are facing pressures with the cost of living – which is why we’re providing support with the cost of living worth over £21bn across this financial year and next ​including a £150 council tax rebate from April and a further £200 energy bill discount in October to cut energy bills quickly. “There will continue to be ongoing demand for oil and gas over the coming decades while we transition to low carbon energy. We will continue to explore all options to maintain security of supply during this transition and will shortly set out our energy security strategy to supercharge our renewable energy and nuclear capacity as well as supporting our North Sea oil and gas industry.” Pedro Guertler, programme leader at E3G, said: “The UK government must act now to permanently convert fossil gas dependency and profits into reduced living costs for all. The government has the tools to make big gains on security through energy efficiency measures for households this year. We must seize the opportunity at the spring statement.”",News/Environment,"UK can eliminate need for Russian gas this year, research shows",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/16/uk-can-eliminate-need-for-russian-gas-this-year-research-shows
3/16/2022,"In the summer of 2020, a month after the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston was toppled and three months after George Floyd was murdered outside a convenience store in Minneapolis, I gave a lecture about race and racism, diversity and inclusion within the television industry. I used that platform, the James MacTaggart Memorial Lecture, to tell the story of how for decades TV has failed not only to address its diversity problem but, at times, even to acknowledge that it has one. On the small screen – as in the worlds of art, publishing, theatre and film – who gets their stories told and who gets to do the telling have never been based on talent and passion alone. Television is an old medium with a long established internal culture, one that developed over the decades and from the outset was exclusive rather than inclusive. The BBC that emerged in the 1920s very much reflected the class-bound society that had spawned it. Early television was dominated by London, and its programmes were largely produced and presented by members of a middle-class elite. Despite the much publicised relocation of various broadcasters and production companies to the regions, a century after British broadcasting began, when we picture a television producer we still do not think of someone with a regional accent from a working-class background. Those people from wealthy backgrounds, who attended private schools and elite universities, are sometimes described in the culture of television recruitment as being from “traditional backgrounds”. The backgrounds of people such as myself, from council estates and failing comprehensive schools, are tellingly described as “non-traditional”. Putting words out into the world, as I did that summer, can have unpredictable effects. One of which was that it helped a group of people – with whom I now work – to devise an initiative that aims to influence the development of a new medium. This year, as well as working in television, I am engaged in StoryTrails, an initiative led by StoryFutures Academy, the UK’s National Centre for Immersive Storytelling at Royal Holloway, University of London. The new medium in which we are working is the metaverse – the 3D internet that uses virtual reality (VR) to create new worlds inside a headset, and augmented reality (AR), which adds layers of digital imagery to the real world, that can be seen through your smartphone. A new medium arrives in the world with no history and, to an extent, no cultural baggage. Women working in the technology sector might challenge the idea that technologies created in such a male-dominated space are completely baggage-free. However, the newness of these technologies means there is the potential to ensure that those who create the metaverse are not defined as being either “traditional” or “non-traditional”. The original sins of Britain’s television and film industries – their exclusivity, their metropolitan focus, their tendency to privilege middle-class outlooks and their long histories of misogyny – should and potentially can be left behind, and prevented from infecting VR and AR and the employment cultures that will develop around them. This dream of inscribing a new and better creative culture is why our StoryTrails project is placing these new technologies into the hands of 50 creatives from across the country whose backgrounds reflect the diversity of UK talent. They are tasked with creating immersive stories that enable audiences to experience history, touch it, feel it and interact with it where it happened. Using film archive from the BFI, reimagined and transformed into stunning 3D, they will give audiences in Blackpool a chance to ride on the “Queercoaster”, an augmented reality journey through Blackpool’s LGBTQ+ history. People in Sheffield, meanwhile, will see how their city is becoming one of the greenest in the UK, thanks to large-screen immersive domes showing how it is throwing off its reputation for heavy industry and smokey skies. StoryTrails will be part of this year’s Unboxed festival – billed as a nationwide celebration of creativity but originally labelled “the festival of Brexit”. Whatever the government’s original ambitions, if the festival currently being created by teams of artists across the UK were the latter rather than the former, not only would I not be involved, I’d be among its most ardent critics. Although the ambition of StoryTrails is to prevent the new cultures around immersive technologies from repeating the mistakes of TV and film, that does not mean they have nothing to learn from older creative industries. Every book written on the history of television in the UK in the end reaches the same conclusion: that what makes British television special is the tradition of public service broadcasting, an ethos that emerged as radio and then television evolved in the UK from 1922 onwards. That tradition matured within the early BBC and was later transmitted to the new independent television companies that appeared in the 1950s, and from there to Channel 4, born three decades after that. Public service broadcasting has been about making content available to everybody irrespective of where they live. In a UK made up of four nations, it has been about shared histories but also divergent experiences. It has sought to forge a sense of national identity while celebrating cultural difference. It has attempted to bring content together in ways that do not presume limitations, and to foster the potential for serendipity and the broadening of horizons. This appeal to universality has, at its best, not been achieved at the expense of minority communities and minority voices. British television, particularly in the early years of Channel 4, offered unique spaces and platforms to minority communities and parts of the UK distant (both geographically and culturally) from London. In 2022, with disinformation surging throughout the world, and a Russian army encircling Kyiv while Putin’s state television convinces millions of Russians that Ukraine is the aggressor, public service broadcasting is more valuable than ever, and something we are perhaps beginning to appreciate more than we have in previous decades. The 3D internet is very different from traditional television but inherent to them both – in very different ways – is a relationship to geography. Among the BBC’s greatest contributions to public life in Britain is local broadcasting – both television and radio. The 3D internet has the potential to be local in new, unique and extraordinary ways. The 3D internet is able to take digital storytelling and overlay it on to real physical spaces. The overwhelming majority of people in the UK own a smartphone, through which it is possible to add virtual layers of augmented reality on to the places that are parts of our everyday lives. Already, 63% of us use AR via social media platforms on a regular basis. This new way of seeing has the potential to enrich our relationship to real physical spaces – in particular to shared public spaces. The 3D internet, with its capacity to stamp history virtually on to geography and create hybrid physical-digital experiences, is about opening up virtual public spaces. It asks what the new public spaces of a 3D internet will be. What will be the equivalent of the public forum, the market, the plaza? Where will we meet each other and where will we forge communities? Over the past two years, something unique in modern history has happened to our public spaces. As a new disease forced us inwards, deeper into our own personal lives, our shared public spaces have been left intermittently empty. Our ancestors experienced similar moments during past epidemics, when city streets and public squares were placed out of bounds. But for us in the modern world – a world with 7 billion inhabitants, the majority of whom for the first time in human history live in cities – the recent silence that hung over streets and public spaces was a new, unwelcome and disorientating experience. The idea behind StoryTrails is that our 50 creatives will use the new technologies to help their communities reconnect to public spaces across the UK. They will do this by reanimating forgotten moments from our history, using the 3D internet to stamp that history virtually on to the places where it occurred. Windrush Square in Brixton will be occupied by the digital voices of people such as Olive Morris, a pioneer in the fight for racial equality back in the 1970s. Or in Omagh, the story of that town’s first gay pride will be similarly told using AR. While our public spaces – the places where ideas and opinions were historically shared – have been closed for much of the pandemic, our metaphorical public squares, our online spaces, have similarly closed in upon themselves. They have become walled gardens of personal preference. The age of the algorithm and the culture wars has created personalised echo chambers – the diametric opposite of the civic ethos behind both the traditional public square, public service broadcasting, and our unique creative industries in the UK.

She added: “I’m thrilled that our Yoto Carnegie shortlist showcases how friendship can help young people find the strength to navigate a path through challenging times. We’re also delighted to celebrate the power of pictures, not only on the Yoto Kate Greenaway list but in a couple of Carnegie titles too. Many of our shortlisted books remind us that art can help us to communicate and connect with young people when words sometimes fail us.” The winners of both awards, as well as the winners selected by groups of children “shadowing” the judging process, will be announced on 16 June.",Arts/Books,Carnegie medal shortlist spotlights real-life stories of friendship in challenging times,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/16/carnegie-medal-prize-shortlist
3/16/2022,"Should we plough up Britain? Many people seem to think so. Even before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, food prices were rocketing. Now they have reached an all-time record. The National Farmers’ Union of Scotland has called for Scotland’s feeble environmental measures – paying farmers to plant hedges, cover crops and introduce beetle banks – to be rescinded, so that food production can be maximised. Others insist that rewilding is a luxury we can no longer afford. It is true that the world now faces a major food crisis. Climate breakdown has begun to bite. Heat domes and droughts in North America and storms and floods in Europe and China last year damaged harvests and drove up prices. By February, the cost of food was 20% higher than a year earlier. Meanwhile, Ukraine and Russia produce nearly 30% of the world’s wheat exports, 15% of the maize (corn) and 75% of the sunflower oil. Altogether, they generate about 12% of the calories traded internationally. Ukrainian farmers are desperately short of fuel and fertiliser. Much of the labour force is now fighting the Russian army, or has been forced to flee. Anything Ukraine manages to produce will be consumed at home. Anyway, the ports are blockaded. Russia might ban grain exports, as it did in 2010, helping to cause a major price spike in 2011. This threat has prompted other countries – Hungary, Turkey, Argentina and China – to restrict their own exports. Even more ominously, just as European countries allowed themselves to become hooked on Russian gas and oil, they are also highly reliant on Russian and Belarusian fertilisers. About one-third of the nitrogen and two-thirds of the potassium imported by the UK and western Europe come from Russia and Belarus, and we can expect them to use this dependency as another economic weapon. The war could raise global food prices by a further 20% this year, and that’s assuming no further climate or pandemic disasters. Every increment ensures that more people go hungry. The Middle East and north Africa are highly reliant on Ukrainian and Russian grain. Almost 40% of Yemen’s wheat is grown in Russia and Ukraine. Already, millions there are close to starvation. Egypt, the world’s largest wheat importer, relies on the warring countries for roughly 70% of its imports. So does this mean we should plough our own furrow? About one-third of the UK’s agricultural land is “croppable”, and almost all of it is in use. The call to plant more land is similar to the call by rightwing Tory MPs to resume fracking: the environmental damage would greatly outweigh the tiny increment of production. And we do nothing to release ourselves from the vicissitudes of the global market if we reduce our imports of food by increasing imports of fertiliser. As for rewilding, most advocates argue it should take place on a large scale only on unproductive land. There are vast areas in the uplands of Britain that produce remarkably little: the National Food Strategy reports that in England 20% of the farmland produces just 3% of our calories. The ratio is likely to be even starker in Wales and Scotland. If this land were rewilded, the contribution it would make to preventing climate and ecological breakdown, both of which severely threaten global food supply, would probably be far greater than the contribution it makes to feeding us directly. Rewilding is not a luxury we can’t afford. It’s an ecological necessity. I’ve heard some people compare the current situation with the second world war, during which, they claim, the UK became self-sufficient. This, of course, is a myth. While, through intense and remarkable efforts, the UK raised its production to become 75% sufficient in food (today we are 62% sufficient, by value) wheat imports from Canada, to give just one example, rose from 20% to 83% of our supply, as exports from western Europe were cut off. So is there something meaningful we could do? Yes: ensure that our scarce arable land is used to feed people rather than to fuel cars or power stations. Despite the global food crisis that has been developing now for seven years, the UK and other European countries have cheerfully been diverting some of their best arable land from food to fuel production. Between 2019 and 2021, farmers in England raised the area of land used to make biogas by an astonishing 19%. Now 120,000 hectares (300,000 acres) is ploughed to grow maize and hybrid rye for biogas, which is marketed, misleadingly, as a green alternative to fossil gas. The reopening of a bioethanol plant in Hull that will turn wheat into fuel for cars is likely to take another 130,000 hectares out of food production. Between them, these energy crops demand 9% of the land used to grow cereals in England. This is an astonishingly destructive and inefficient business. About 450 hectares of land is needed to feed a biogas plant with a capacity of one megawatt. By contrast, a megawatt of wind turbine capacity requires only one-third of a hectare. When you include the impacts of soil erosion, for which maize in particular is notorious, the climate costs are likely to be worse than those of fossil gas. This good land would make a far greater contribution to food production than it can to energy production. Needless to say, the National Farmers’ Union of Scotland, so keen to grub up hedges and beetle banks to grow more food, has for years been encouraging its members to produce crops for biogas plants, which inevitably means reducing the amount of food they grow. If we were serious about reducing the pressure on global food supply, we would also switch to a plant-based diet. Were everyone to do so, the agricultural land needed to feed the world would decline by 75%. Even though our direct consumption of grain would rise, the total arable area would fall by 19%, because animals would no longer need to be fed on crops. Food security and food nationalism are by no means the same thing, and in some cases polar opposites. But our global food system is fragile and highly vulnerable to shocks. It requires complete transformation, of the kind I propose in Regenesis, published in May. Ploughing the few small corners where wildlife persists is not the answer.

3/16/2022,"The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, will deliver a virtual address to the US Congress on Wednesday, the latest in a series of speeches to western leaders as he works to galvanize support for his besieged nation. The remarks to both chambers of Congress come on day 21 of the battle for Ukraine’s survival under an intensifying assault from Russia. Russian troops are advancing on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, in a war that has already killed hundreds of civilians in aerial and artillery bombardment, including at least 100 children. More than 3 million people have fled Ukraine since the invasion, causing the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since the second world war. Zelenskiy’s speech follows similar addresses to the UK parliament, in which he invoked Shakespeare and echoed Winston Churchill’s famous wartime oration to the House of Commons about defiance in the face of an apparently overwhelming aggressor. On Tuesday, Zelenskiy appealed to Canada’s parliament, and the nation’s large Ukrainian diaspora, to rally behind his country. That evening, the prime ministers of Nato allies and Russian neighbors Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia traveled by train to Kyiv, which was under a 35-hour curfew as Russian shells and missiles rained down on the capital, striking residential areas and civilian infrastructure. It came on the same day Zelenskiy acknowledged that Ukraine’s longstanding hope of joining Nato was unlikely. “For years, we heard about the apparently open door, but have already also heard that we will not enter there, and these are truths and must be acknowledged,” the Ukrainian president said in a speech before the leaders of the Joint Expeditionary Force, a UK-led initiative bringing together 10 north Atlantic countries to create a capability for responding rapidly to crises. In his remarks on Wednesday, which will come nearly two weeks after Zelenskiy met virtually, behind the scenes, with a small group of members of Congress, he is expected to call on the US once again to “close the skies” over Ukraine. He is also likely to press to be supplied with fighter jets by Nato allies that Ukrainian pilots can fly up against Russian air forces, and steeper economic sanctions in the face of an advancing Russian assault. The Biden administration has so far flatly ruled out an option of the west imposing a no-fly zone over the country, determined to avoid inevitable direct combat between the US and Russian forces – a conflict the US president has said would lead to “world war three”. The Biden administration also rejected an offer from Poland to turn over its Soviet-era fighter jets to Ukraine, which had been made only if the US and Nato facilitated the transfer. Administration officials argued the move could be seen as escalatory by Moscow. But Biden is facing growing pressure to reconsider his position. A growing chorus of lawmakers on Capitol Hill are publicly pressuring Biden to increase military aid to Ukraine, including sending fighter jets and air defense systems. The calls come as the US and allies tighten their economic vice on Russia, apparently leading Moscow to turn to China for financial support. On Tuesday, Biden signed into law a funding measure that will provide a record $13.6bn in emergency aid to Ukraine and its European allies. This week, lawmakers are expected to take up legislation that would end normal trade relations with Russia after Biden last Friday said the US would join Europe and other allies in revoking its preferred trade status. Biden will travel to the Belgian capital, Brussels, next week for a meeting with Nato leaders to discuss the ongoing crisis in Ukraine and reassure allies of the US’s commitment to the defense alliance. “His goal is to meet in person, face-to-face with his European counterparts and talk about where we are at this point in the conflict in the invasion of Ukraine by Russia,” the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said on Tuesday. She added: “We’ve been incredibly aligned to date – that doesn’t happen by accident. The president is a big believer in face-to-face diplomacy, so it’s an opportunity to do exactly that.”",News/US news,Zelenskiy to address US Congress and call for tougher line against Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/16/zelenskiy-address-us-congress-ukraine-russia
3/16/2022,"Truth Social, Donald Trump’s new social media network, was supposed to be “a major new platform” where Republicans and Democrats alike could converse in an environment free from the “censorship” of big tech, an environment with an “ironclad commitment to protecting vigorous debate”. Instead, nearly a month after its launch, Truth Social has become a laughingstock, marked by a botched rollout, a share price collapse and, in Trump, a figurehead who doesn’t actually post much to his own social media platform. The network, born out of Trump being banned from Twitter, Facebook and YouTube due to the risk of the former president inciting violence, was due to launch on 21 February, five months after Trump announced its creation in a typically hyperbolic statement. “We live in a world where the Taliban has a huge presence on Twitter, yet your favorite American president has been silenced. This is unacceptable,” Trump said. “I’m excited to soon begin sharing my thoughts on TRUTH Social and to fight back against Big Tech.” When the launch date came round, however, tens of thousands of people were unable to access Truth Social. The Guardian attempted to sign up on 21 February and was finally granted access on 5 March. And almost a month after the launch, Trump has so far shared only one thought to the platform; a boilerplate message in mid-February urging people to “Get ready!”. Unsurprisingly, Trump is said to be unhappy with his new social media network. According to the Daily Beast, people close to Trump “have heard the former president on the phone swearing gratuitously and asking things like: ‘What the fuck is going on’” with Truth Social. Trump is said to be particularly piqued by the sluggish rollout – some would-be Truth Social users are still waiting to get on to the platform – and upset that Truth Social is not more popular. The former president’s anger is not unfounded. In early March the network was averaging just 300,000 visits each day, according to the Daily Beast. Truth Social spent 21-23 February as the most downloaded app on the Apple app store, according to Similarweb, but by 12 March it was only the 173rd most popular app. But the problems with Truth Social go deeper than the fact that barely anyone uses it. At the time of writing, there is no way to use Truth Social on a webpage, with a user forced to download the app to their phone. That only works, however, if they have an iPhone, because Truth Social is not yet available as a Google app. Shared links to individual Truth Social posts bring up an error message. The site itself is barely distinguishable from Twitter, one of the “tech titans” that Trump railed against when he launched Truth Social. Posts on the platform are called “truths”, and when visiting people’s profiles, users can see their “truths and replies” – Twitter enables people to view “tweets and replies”. Unlike Twitter, the Truth Social app is sluggish, while the list of profiles suggested to new users is thin at best – largely because, as Politico reported: “Many major players in the conservative world aren’t on the app.” The missing major players appear to include the rightwing media figures Steve Bannon, Glenn Beck and Tucker Carlson, as well as Trump’s sometime lawyer Rudy Giuliani. (There is a @RudyGiuliani account on TruthSocial, but it has just 35 followers and is unverified.) The big-name conservatives who have joined don’t seem to be seeing much reward. According to Truth Social Sean Hannity has 266,000 on the platform, but the Fox News host’s “truths” are struggling for engagement. Hannity posted several truths on Tuesday morning; more than four hours later one post had been liked by 10 people, another by just nine. Trump’s one truth has been liked 86,000 times, and received 13,000 replies, although many of those appear to be spam postings advertising a niche conservative cryptocurrency. There is little evidence of political diversity on Truth Social, despite Trump’s promise that the platform would be a “big tent” filled with people of “all political stripes, and all different viewpoints”. Whether an echo chamber of rightwing voices proves an attractive proposition to Truth Social’s users remains to be seen. But while Trump lovers might be willing to put up with a clunky, Twitter-aping platform, and – to date – a dearth of content, a bigger problem might be that Truth Social is far from the free speech utopia Trump promised. “We find ourselves being censored and dictated to by a small group of self-righteous scolds and self-appointed arbiters of what everyone else is allowed to think, say, share, and do,” Trump said in a press release in October. “We will not silence our fellow citizens simply because they might be wrong – or worse, because we think that Americans ‘can’t handle the truth’.” But a review of Truth Social’s terms of service reveals a comprehensive list of things people can and cannot do and say on the platform. Users’ posts should not contain “profanity, or abusive or racist, language”, according to Truth Social’s rules. Posts should also “not contain discriminatory references based on religion, race, gender, national origin, age, marital status, sexual orientation, or disability”. Truth Social also reserves the right to “refuse, restrict access to, limit the availability of, or disable” anyone’s posts. People should also not make contributions which are “false, inaccurate, or misleading”, which could prove a problem for a site founded by a man who continues to lie about the accuracy of the 2020 presidential election. To Truth Social’s credit, however, its terms of service do provide an avenue for users to get in touch, should they have any issue with these draconian rules. Truth Social even provides a physical address where users can direct their complaints, and it seems that those complaints will go right to the top. The address is in Palm Beach, Florida, at 1100 South Ocean Blvd. Specifically, it is the address of Mar-a-Lago, the private members club and vacation resort where Trump has lived since leaving the White House.",News/Media,Truth Social: the failing anti-Twitter platform even Trump barely uses,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/16/truth-social-donald-trump-failing-anti-twitter-platform
3/16/2022,"The first day of meteorological spring has passed, but spring pays little heed to the calendar; it tiptoes in with hesitant steps. Hazel catkins, early this year and battered by February’s storms, have withered already; snowdrops are mud-spattered by heavy rain; lesser celandine flowers open as the sun melts overnight frost. And now, curlews are returning to the dale. I could hear their plaintive calls well before they appeared over the pines – more than 40 birds, a heartening, joyous sighting of a red-listed species that is becoming scarcer. They wheeled in a wide circle, dangling long legs in their steep descent into the sheep pasture, landing with a few quick running steps before regaining their poise and probing for worms with elegant curved bills. Soon they will separate into smaller groups and move higher on the fells. Then their courtship flights, long glides trailing the liquid notes of their bubbling calls across the landscape, provide haunting, soul-stirring music in the North Pennine uplands. But for now they feed in a large flock, perhaps for mutual security. Their cryptic, mottled brown plumage blends well with muddy grass and molehills and I might not have noticed them if I hadn’t seen them land. They are wary. One bird rises, settles again, and the whole flock turns to look towards the pines. Suddenly there are yelping alarm calls and they are all airborne. Two mewing buzzards appear, scavengers that present little threat, especially as they are preoccupied in their own courtship, but the curlews take no chances. It’s quiet again, with only the sound of wind through the pines, but not for long. I hear loud, exultant, piping calls – a flyby flock of recently returned oystercatchers, immaculate pied plumage sullied a little by mud clinging to their scarlet beaks. They, too, have come to feed in these pastures, before dispersing along the valley. The Nobel laureate novelist Sinclair Lewis once memorably described countryside in spring as “hysteric with new life”. We haven’t reached that point yet, but today it felt as though winter was loosening its grip and those hesitant steps are gathering unstoppable pace.

3/16/2022,"As the war in Ukraine rages on, Russia is ramping up one of its most powerful weapons: disinformation. Social media companies are scrambling to respond. False claims about the invasion have been spread by users in Russia as well as official state media accounts. Russia frequently frames itself as an innocent victim and has pushed disinformation including that the US was providing biological weapons to Ukraine (denounced by the White House as a “conspiracy theory”) and that victims of an attack on a Ukrainian hospital were paid actors. In response, companies including Meta, YouTube and Twitter have announced waves of new measures, spurred by pressure from the Ukrainian government, world leaders and the public. But experts say the tech industry’s response has been haphazard and lacks the range and scope to tackle sophisticated disinformation campaigns. And even when policies exist, observers fear they are poorly and inconsistently enforced. “By and large, platforms have responded to the challenge of state-backed disinformation campaigns by playing a futile game of Whac-a-Mole,” said Evan Greer, the deputy director of Fight for the Future, a digital rights non-profit group. Tech companies have in some cases flagged misinformation as being state-sponsored or potentially false rather than removing it, or they have banned individual accounts rather than enacting more sweeping measures against mis- and disinformation. When they have acted, it has often been too little, too late – YouTube, for example, finally took action on Friday against state-sponsored disinformation following weeks of pressure from human rights advocates, but not before that content was widely shared. One of the most recent examples of this on-the-fly approach was Meta’s surprising decision to make exceptions to its longstanding rule against calls for violence, allowing users on Instagram and Facebook in 12 eastern European and western Asian countries to call for death to Russian soldiers. Following some confusion, the company later clarified that users still cannot call for the death of Vladimir Putin or other leaders. For many, the episode underscored just how opaque the platforms have been when it comes to decision-making on Russia-related policies. And it’s not just new policies that have lacked cohesion. Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube already had rules about flagging state-sponsored content, but reports have found that these policies are often poorly enforced, allowing widely circulated posts featuring government propaganda to fall through the cracks. A study released by the Center for Countering Digital Hate examined a sample of 3,593 recent articles posted by Russian state news sources and found Facebook was failing to label 91% of the posts as state-sponsored. YouTube, for its part, has ramped up efforts to crack down on state-sponsored content, removing more than 1,000 channels and 15,000 videos. But the move came weeks after advocates called on the company to do so, and after videos spreading disinformation racked up thousands of views. The biological weapons theory has proved a particular vulnerability for the platform. YouTube has not only failed to remove videos spouting these theories, a study from Media Matters for America found, but it has also profited off them through monetized channels. “Despite their stated policies, many of these platforms are not labeling disinformation and propaganda appropriately, and that’s a big problem,” said Heidi Beirich, an expert on rightwing extremism at the non-profit Global Project Against Hate and Extremism. At the root of the problem is that the core business model these platforms operate makes them ideal for manipulation and abuse, said Greer. “Instead of calling for more aggressive platform-level censorship, we should focus on monopoly power and the way that big tech platforms are designed.” In other words, as long as these platforms value engagement over all else, there is little incentive to crack down on the lies and sensationalist content that generate a disproportionate amount of traffic. Frances Haugen, the former Facebook employee turned whistleblower, said as much in her testimony to Congress in October 2021, noting that “there is no will at the top to make sure these systems are run in an adequately safe way”. She added: “Until we bring in a counterweight, these things will be operated for the shareholders’ interest and not the public interest.” While Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube are facing increasing pressure to crack down on misinformation, TikTok has arisen as a new and often overlooked frontier. As a relatively nascent platform, TikTok has seen rapid growth and little regulation. Researchers say from the start of the invasion of Ukraine, they saw how quickly misinformation was shared on the platform. “TikTok by its very design is meant to make it easy to splice videos, images, and sounds together, and that’s a useful tool for those attempting to push disinformation,” said Cindy Otis, a disinformation expert and author. Some evidence points to the fact that disinformation may be Russia-coordinated. One study, published by Media Matters for America on 11 March, showed how more than 180 Russian influencers on the platform had participated in a concerted propaganda campaign to promote online support for Russia’s war, sharing hundreds of posts with the hashtag #RussianLivesMatter. TikTok has been so central to the conflict that the Biden administration recently invited TikTok influencers to the White House to brief them on the realities of the war and involve them in the fight against disinformation. TikTok shut down its services in Russia more than a week ago to avoid action from the Kremlin, but some influencers there appear to be posting despite the ban. A spokeswoman for the company said it has policies in place to combat misinformation and said, in response to Ukraine, the company expedited the rollout of its state media policy, which applies labels to Russia-controlled media accounts. “We continue to respond to the war in Ukraine with increased safety and security resources to detect emerging threats and remove harmful misinformation,” said spokeswoman Jamie Favazza. “We also partner with independent fact-checking organizations to support our efforts to help TikTok remain a safe and authentic place.” Russia’s response to the crackdown by tech platforms has been swift and retaliatory, with the country blocking or reducing its citizens’ access to Netflix, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, and Apple. The country has also censored outside news outlets. This in turn has increased the Russian state’s monopoly over information, an alarming development in a country where dissent and unbiased news was already under threat. It’s a situation that has long existed in other digitally closed-off countries, with serious consequences. Experts fear that a Russian shutoff of news outlets and social platforms, imperfect as they are, could further restrict people from organizing against state power or fighting human rights abuses. “Soon millions of ordinary Russians will find themselves cut off from reliable information, deprived of their everyday ways of connecting with family and friends and silenced from speaking out,” tweeted Nick Clegg, president of global affairs for Facebook’s parent company, Meta. China, for example, has long been able to control the narrative on its treatment of Uyghur people, which governments including the US have described as a genocide. Social media companies have been accused of indirectly supporting the human rights abuses by allowing misinformation about them to be shared on their platforms – and in some cases even accepting advertising money from the governments behind the actions. “We have all looked the other way with what social media firms are enabling in China, and now we are seeing it happen again,” Beirich said. “The big question for all of us is: what are the base values we should have around information?” she said. “This is showing why we want protected, free, and fair internet.”",News/Media,‘Game of Whac-a-Mole’: why Russian disinformation is still running amok on social media,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/15/russia-disinformation-social-media-ukraine
3/16/2022,"In a flak jacket and helmet, the Chinese reporter Lu Yuguang stands on the side of a road as a Russian tank roars past. “I’m on the frontline in Mariupol,” he says into the microphone. He then interviews a Russian soldier who says he’s not nervous as he’s been “fighting for eight years”. In another shot, Lu talks with a group of Russian soldiers in the back of a military vehicle. The dispatches are unusual for their extraordinary access – Lu, a veteran war reporter for a Chinese news outlet, Phoenix TV, is perhaps the only foreign correspondent embedded with Russian troops as they continue the brutal invasion of Ukraine. He has filed reports from cities under Russian attack since the invasion began almost three weeks ago, including in Mariupol where local authorities say thousands of people have been killed. Lu appears to have gained exclusive access to Russia’s side of the conflict. In one report on 2 March, he interviewed the leader of the self-proclaimed republic in Donetsk, Denis Pushilin. Lu said the Donetsk militia cannot compare to Ukrainian forces, “but with the help of Russian forces, eastern Ukraine militia have liberated 40 residential areas within the administrative line. The victory keeps expanding.” The Guardian is not aware of any other foreign journalists reporting from such close quarters on the Russian side of the invasion. A long-running Russian government campaign against independent media has intensified since the war began, with foreign outlets among those forced to end operations after Vladimir Putin signed a law carrying 15-year prison terms for what the Kremlin considers “fake news”. As such, Lu’s unusual access to the Russian military stands in stark contrast to that of other reporters. It has also fuelled questions about the extent of cooperation between Moscow and Beijing. Since the two governments signed an “unlimited partnership” shortly before Russia went to war in Ukraine, Beijing has struggled to balance its support for Moscow with the global condemnation of the invasion and swaths of international sanctions. It has outwardly sought to maintain a neutral position in the conflict but refuses to label Russia’s act as an invasion or the fighting as a war, and has amplified anti-western narratives, blaming the US and Nato for the conflict. Beijing has also pushed Russian disinformation and conspiracy theories, including un-evidenced accusations that US-funded labs in Ukraine were secretly producing chemical weapons, and early claims by Russian state media that the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, had fled Kyiv. Lu is a well-known journalist in China, and his career and background have been reported on by Tencent, Sohu and Sina. His reports from Ukraine have included Russian disinformation such as claims of more than 1,000 people held hostage as human shields by Ukrainian militants. However, his interviews with Ukrainian civilian victims, and criticism of Chinese internet users objectifying Ukrainian women, have also drawn nationalistic and pro-Russia trolling, accusing him of creating pro-Ukraine “rumours” and being “crooked assed”, an internet slang term for having bias or lacking objectivity. According to profiles on Phoenix TV’s website and news articles about Lu, the correspondent is a former navy officer in the People’s Liberation Army, who lived in Moscow for several decades and covered events including the Chechen war, where he reportedly had Russian military protection. He has received multiple awards from the Russian government and military for his reporting. He has previously said that his outlet has good relations with intelligence figures in Russia. ProfSteve Tsang, the director of the Soas China Institute, said Lu could have gained access through his personal connection to Russia, or because of China’s general support for its government. “They are not mutually exclusive. The only thing I think we know for sure is that Russia will not allow any foreign journalist to be embedded with Russian forces unless it is certain that the embedded foreign journalist will portray Russian forces and efforts in a positive light. The fact that Lu is embedded should show that the Russian authorities know him well enough to be certain he would not write negatively about the Russian war efforts.” Phoenix TV did not respond to questions about how Lu was able to embed with Russian troops.",News/World news,‘I’m on the frontline in Mariupol’: the Chinese reporter embedded with Russian troops,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/16/im-on-the-frontline-in-mariupol-the-chinese-reporter-embedded-with-russian-troops
3/16/2022,"A new US Secret Service report details a rising threat from men who identify as “involuntary celibates” or “incels”, due to their inability to form intimate relationships with women. The report released on Tuesday and prepared by the National Threat Assessment Center (NTAC) highlights behavioral threat assessment themes identified in years of research examining targeted violence. Themes include concerning and threatening communications, concerning online content, chronic and acute stressors, elicited concern in others, interpersonal difficulties, history of being bullied, financial instability, failed life aspirations and lack of consequences. As a case study, the Secret Service examined a 2018 shooting at a yoga class in Tallahassee, Florida, in which a man killed two women and wounded six. “The attacker was motivated to carry out violence by his inability to develop or maintain relationships with women, along with his perception of women’s societal power over men,” the report said. The gunman, 40-year-old Scott Paul Beierle, exhibited numerous warning signs including a history of inappropriate and criminal behavior toward women and girls. Steve Driscoll, a lead research specialist at NTAC, said: “During his teen years, the attacker was accused of stalking his classmates and he wrote stories that centered around violent themes. “One of those stories was 81 pages long and involved the protagonist murdering several girls before committing suicide. The female characters in the story that were killed represented the attacker’s actual classmates from his high school, but he slightly changed the names in his writing.” Beierle was arrested three times for groping women and was called “Ted Bundy” by his roommates, in reference to a notorious serial killer who targeted women. On the day of the shooting, Beierle left a note in his hotel room that said: “If I can’t find one decent female to live with, I will find many indecent females to die with. If they are intent on denying me life, I will have no choice, but to deny them life … Their arrogance, indifference and treachery will finally be exposed and punished.” According to the report, although Beierle did not adopt any specific ideological labels such as “anti-feminist” or “incel”, his behavior and beliefs aligned with many who do. Another incident examined in the report is the 2014 killings in Santa Barbara, California, in which 22-year-old Elliot Rodger killed six people and injured 14. Before the attacks, Rodger lamented his inability to find a girlfriend and documented his contempt for women and interracial couples. The report also cites the 2020 murder of the son of a US district court judge, Esther Salas, who was killed by 72-year-old Roy Den Hollander, a self-described “anti-feminist lawyer” who believed “manhood is in serious jeopardy in America”. According to the report, NTAC research has shown no specific profile of an individual who plans or executes an act of targeted violence. Attackers vary in age, race, sex, education level, employment history and other characteristics. However, a unifying factor among most attackers is a set of concerning behaviors displayed before acts of violence. Although the Secret Service is best known for its protection of US presidents, it has also extensively examined and implemented behavioral threat assessment programs designed to “identify and intervene with those who pose a risk of engaging in targeted violence”. The agency noted that misogynistic violence is not restricted to high-profile incidents of mass violence. Rather, “misogyny frequently appears in more prevalent acts of violence, including stalking and domestic abuse”. As a result, the report said, responses to threats need to be collaborative between law enforcement, courts, mental health providers and domestic violence and hate crime advocacy groups. “The risk of future tragedies can be reduced if the appropriate systems are in place to identify the warning signs,” the report said. Dr Lina Alathari, director of NTAC, said: “Traditionally law enforcement and other public safety officials focus on crimes … and so, if there’s no ‘direct threat’ or a criminal statute violated, they often feel that they can’t do anything. “But what we know from the research and what we know from communities doing this successfully is that if you have a trained professional in threat assessment, in identifying warning signs and knowing what the proper resources are available … that’s when you have success stories.”",News/US news,"‘Incels’ are a rising threat in the US, Secret Service report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/16/involuntary-celibates-incels-threat-us-secret-service
3/16/2022,"The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates for the first time since 2018 as it struggles with soaring US inflation, the impact of the war in Ukraine, and the continuing coronavirus crisis. The Fed has a dual mandate – to maximize employment and keep prices under control. The job market and the wider economy have made an impressive recovery from the lows of the pandemic, thanks in part to Fed rate cuts and a massive stimulus program, but prices have increased by 7.9% in the year through February – the highest rate of inflation in 40 years. With inflation now rising around the world, the Fed is expected to announce it will follow other central banks, including the Bank of England, and raise rates by a quarter percentage point. The Fed chair, Jerome Powell, will also hold a Wednesday press conference, where he will be asked about the central bank’s plans for future rises. Supply chain issues have led to sharp increases in a variety of areas including used cars, food and utilities that are causing particular hardship for lower-income Americans. The Fed initially dismissed rising prices and “transitory”, but has since acknowledged high inflation is likely to be around for some time. Supply problems that appeared to be normalizing earlier this year are also now feeling the impact of the war in Ukraine and face further setbacks as China imposes new lockdowns to curb new coronavirus outbreaks. Raising rates too quickly threatens to push the US into recession. This week, CNBC’s Fed Survey – which gauges the opinions of fund managers, strategists and economists – put the probability of recession in the US at 33% in the next 12 months, up 10 percentage points from the 1 February survey. The latest survey put the of a chance of a recession in Europe at 50%. With inflation running at close to four times the Fed’s target rate of 2%, Powell has made clear that the central bank will raise rates in an attempt to curb rising prices. But some economists question how much impact the Fed can have on such a complex issue. JW Mason, associate professor of economics at John Jay College, said a quarter-point rate rise was unlikely to have much impact on inflation or the wider economy. “It is a strange feature of the way we think and talk about economics today that we have given this wildly outsized importance to this one policy tool used by this one part of government,” he said. Mason said he expected inflation would ease without the Fed’s intervention over the next year – albeit “less than we hoped it would”. He pointed out that car prices – until recently the largest source of inflation – were already falling. While he said a series of small rate rises were not likely to have a major impact overall “a sufficiently large rise in interest rates will have a substantial negative effect on real economic activity”. Mason said other branches of government were better able to deal with price issues in the broader economy, such as soaring rents and home prices or gas and utility bills, and that tools such as price caps or stimulus cheques could be used to alleviate hardship. Testifying to Congress early this month, Powell made clear was prepared to raise rates in larger half-percentage-point increments should price increases not slow down. But he also acknowledged the economic outlook had been made more complicated by the war in Ukraine. The conflict “is a game-changer and will be with us for a very long time”, Powell told the House of Representatives financial services committee. “There are events yet to come ... and we don’t know what the real effect on the US economy will be. We don’t know whether those effects will be quite lasting or not.”",News/Business,US Fed set to raise interest rates for first time since 2018 amid soaring inflation,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/16/us-federal-reserve-interest-rates-inflation
3/16/2022,"The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said he sees possible room for compromise in talks with Russia ahead of a fresh round of discussions, despite Moscow’s stepped up bombardment Kyiv and as fears for the port city of Mariupol deepened. “The meetings continue, and, I am informed, the positions during the negotiations already sound more realistic. But time is still needed for the decisions to be in the interests of Ukraine,” Zelenskiy said in a video address early on Wednesday. “Efforts are still needed, patience is needed,” he said. “Any war ends with an agreement.” The leading Ukrainian negotiator, presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak, said there were “fundamental contradictions” between the two sides but added that “there is certainly room for compromise.” Another aide to Zelenskiy, Ihor Zhovkva, said negotiations had become “more constructive” and that Russia had softened its stand by no longer airing its demands that Ukraine surrender. Talks were set to resume via video link on Wednesday. As the war approached the end of its third week and heavy shelling of Ukraine’s cities continued, the US president, Joe Biden, signed off on $13.6bn in aid. Zelenskiy thanked Biden and “all the friends of Ukraine” for the support. An update from Ukraine’s ministry of defence on Wednesday said the “worst situation remains in the area of Mariupol, where the opponent tries to block the city in the western and eastern outskirts of the city”. It came as the Associated Press reported Russian troops had seized a hospital in Mariupol and took about 500 people hostage during another assault on the southern port city late on Tuesday, regional leader Pavlo Kyrylenko said. On Wednesday morning, there were reports that a residential tower block had been hit by shelling in Kyiv. The Ukrainian president is due to address US Congress on Wednesday and Nato military commanders will also meet in Brussels to draw up plans for new ways to deter Russia, including more troops and missile defences in eastern Europe, officials and diplomats said. Ministers will hear from their Ukrainian counterpart, Oleksii Reznikov, who is expected to plead for more weapons from individual Nato countries, as Russian attacks on Ukraine’s cities continue. Earlier, Zelenskiy acknowledged that Ukraine would not become a Nato member, in a significant concession on a day when the invading force tightened its grip on the capital. The leaders of three European Union countries – Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia – met in Kyiv on Tuesday, arriving by train in a bold show of support amid the danger. In a press conference after the meeting, the Czech prime minister, Petr Fiala, told Ukrainians: “Europe stands with you.” “The main goal of our visit and the main message of our mission is to say to our Ukrainian friends that they are not alone,” he added. In other developments: The US Senate passed a unanimous resolution condemning the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, as a war criminal. The leader of Poland’s ruling party, Jarosław Kaczyński, said an international peacekeeping mission should be sent to Ukraine. The fast-moving developments on the diplomatic front and on the ground came as Moscow’s forces stepped up their bombardment of Kyiv, and an estimated 20,000 civilians fled the desperately encircled port city of Mariupol by way of a humanitarian corridor. At least five people were killed in the latest artillery barrage on Kyiv, prompting its city hall to impose a 35-hour curfew from Tuesday night amid further signs that the focus of the Russian campaign has shifted to the destruction of residential areas and civilian infrastructure. After repeated bombardments and almost encircled by Russian forces, about half of Kyiv’s 3.5 million prewar population has fled, officials have said, with many of those who remain spending their nights sheltering in underground stations. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said the city faced “a difficult and dangerous moment” but promised it would not surrender. “The capital is the heart of Ukraine, and it will be defended,” he said. “Kyiv, which is currently the symbol and the forward operating base of Europe’s freedom and security, will not be given up by us.” The series of four heavy pre-dawn explosions rocked residential districts of Kyiv on Tuesday, hours before talks between Ukraine and Russia were set to resume. “Streets have been turned into a mush of steel and concrete,” said the head of the capital region, Oleksiy Kuleba. “People have been hiding for weeks in basements.” One strike on Kyiv hit a 16-storey housing block, where fire raged and smoke billowed from the shattered skeleton of the building, as emergency services and stunned locals navigated an obstacle course of glass, metal and other debris littering the road. Residents in Kyiv’s northern Podil district, which is close to Russian positions, told the Guardian they had heard an increase in shelling between the two sides over the past two days. On Tuesday morning, Daria Kloichko came home to her flat in the north of the city, which was all but destroyed by a rocket at 5am. The apartment was strewn with glass and little was salvageable. There was hardly a flat in the block untouched by the attack. A refugee from the 2014 war in eastern Ukraine against Russian proxy forces, Kloichko and her husband hugged and cried as they took pictures off the wall – the only objects that somehow survived the attack. “Luckily, we weren’t here,” Kloichko said with a tear-stained face. Andriy, who lived in the block but declined to give his surname, said the blast jammed the door to his child’s bedroom and he had to break it down to get in. In the east, the airport in Dnipro also sustained massive damage overnight, while Russian forces launched more than 60 strikes on Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, according to the regional administration chief, Oleh Sinehubov. The strikes hit the city’s historic centre, including the main marketplace. The UN said that nearly 1.4 million children – almost one every second – had left Ukraine since the invasion began on 24 February. According to the UN refugee agency (UNHCR), 3,000,381 people have fled Russia’s onslaught in what NGOs have called Europe’s biggest refugee crisis since the second world war. The UNHCR expects the refugee total to reach 4 million.",News/World news,Zelenskiy says Russia’s position in negotiations is becoming ‘more realistic’ as fears deepen for Mariupol,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/16/zelenskiy-says-russias-position-in-negotiations-is-becoming-more-realistic-as-fears-deepen-for-mariupol

3/16/2022,"South Australia’s environment minister has challenged the federal government to “fast-track” Australia’s transition to electric vehicles by matching the state’s subsidy scheme aimed at increasing uptake. Speaking to Guardian Australia, David Speirs said that with a federal election looming and an oil price shock caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine inflating the cost of petrol there had “never been a better time” to transition to electric cars. “Maybe the need hasn’t been there, hasn’t been so pressing in the past, but it’s certainly pressing now,” Speirs said. “I would certainly like to see the federal government make a contribution towards EVs and partner with the state to fast-track that transition. I’m quite comfortable putting the challenge out there to my friends in the federal government. “I’d love to work with the feds on a subsidy for electric vehicles which matches our own state-based work. At a time when fuel prices are surging, this could be an ideal time to trigger a step change in EV uptake.” The federal energy minister, Angus Taylor, was contacted for comment. South Australia offers a $3,000 subsidy on the sale of new electric vehicles. Similar schemes exist in other states and territories. The Queensland Labor government announced on Wednesday that it would introduce a $3,000 subsidy on EVs that cost less than $58,000, starting on 1 July. It also announced $10m to build new charging stations. The most generous support has been offered by the New South Wales Liberal government, where drivers can apply to have stamp duty reimbursed on purchases of new and used electric cars that cost up to $78,000, saving them up to $3,000. They can also claim $3,000 in rebates if they are buying one of the first 25,000 EVs cheaper than $68,750 sold in the state, meaning a buyer could claim back a maximum $5,540. South Australians will vote at a state election on Saturday about whether to return the incumbent Liberal government. Road transport emissions represent the largest share of carbon dioxide emissions in South Australia, where renewable energy penetration is high. The Liberal government has said it would continue its existing programs but has not made any additional promises going into the election. The Labor opposition has said it would maintain the existing incentives but repeal a road user charge. Under the current framework, the state government charges EV drivers a fee of 2.5 cents for every kilometre they drive until 2027 or when EV uptake reaches 30% of sales. Scott Morrison was in Western Australia on Wednesday to announce a $1.3bn modern manufacturing initiative to develop mining projects for critical minerals used in the clean energy and EV industries. However, the government has not announced any specific measures to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles, and the future fuels and vehicle strategy released in November last year has been considered a wash by industry. The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, said if elected Labor would reduce the cost of EVs by cutting the fringe benefit tax. “We want to reduce the taxes on electric vehicles and make them cheaper,” he said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Behyad Jafari, from the Electric Vehicle Council, said EVs currently represented about 2% of the new car market in Australia, while in comparable countries they make up 20% of the market. “[The South Australian government] is correct in pointing to the federal government, saying they should be doing more, but that doesn’t let SA off the hook,” Jafari said. “What happens right around the world is state governments contributed about 25% of the support and federal governments provide 75%, so it is a partnership. The only thing we’d say to SA, and as we’d advised them for a time: what the NSW government has done in this space is much stronger.” Jafari said the spike in global oil prices showed Australia should be moving faster. “The federal government absolutely knew something like this was coming,” he said. “We also know this is going to happen again – over several years and throughout our lives. “Why didn’t the government do something before? And now we’re here, what are we going to do now? You elect a government to recognise this is going to happen, plan for it and avoid it.”",News/Environment,SA environment minister challenges Morrison government to ‘fast-track’ electric vehicle transition,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/16/sa-energy-minister-challenges-morrison-government-to-fast-track-electric-vehicle-transition
3/16/2022,"Ben Roberts-Smith ran an “aggressive intimidation campaign” against witnesses giving evidence to a government war crimes inquiry, a former comrade has told the federal court. The soldier, anonymised before the court as Person 7, also gave evidence Roberts-Smith repeatedly punched and kicked a “terrified” unarmed Afghan prisoner “who posed no threat whatsoever”; bullied other Australian soldiers; and made threats he would “choke a man to death with my bare hands”. Person 7 told the court that, shortly before their first mission on a 2012 deployment – in the days after a comrade had been killed – Roberts-Smith said to him: “Hey mate, I’m going to talk the talk, I want you to make sure I walk the walk. Before this trip’s over I’m going to choke a man to death with my bare hands, I’m going to watch the life drain out of his eyes.” Person 7, a still-serving SAS veteran of more than a quarter of a century in the Australian military, and who deployed 11 times to Afghanistan with the SAS, gave wide-ranging evidence about special forces operations over more than a decade. He told the court he had raised allegations of war crimes committed by Roberts-Smith with SAS senior command as long ago as 2013. Roberts-Smith, a recipient of the Victoria Cross and one of Australia’s most decorated soldiers, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies all wrongdoing. Person 7 was subpoenaed to appear as a witness for the newspapers. In 2015, the Inspector General of the Australian Defence Force conducted an inquiry into allegations of potential war crimes by Australian special forces. That inquiry, the Brereton inquiry, reported in 2020. Soldiers appearing in this defamation proceeding are not permitted to discuss their appearance or evidence before any other inquiry. Person 7 said in 2017 and 2018 he believed Roberts-Smith “conducted an aggressive intimidation campaign of witnesses” who had given evidence to the defence inquiry. Person 7 said at least two comrades received threatening letters he believed to be from Roberts-Smith, and another soldier told him he had been personally pressured by Roberts-Smith to change his testimony. Person 7 said another SAS soldier had his house raided by police after a tipoff on a firearms allegation for which no evidence was found. “RS was disparaging soldiers who were speaking out and speaking up,” Person 7 said, telling the court Roberts-Smith had condemned those soldiers as “cowards” who were jealous, “bitter and twisted” over his decorations. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Person 7 said that motivated him to agree to speak to 60 Minutes about what he had witnessed in Afghanistan: “To be a voice from within.” He said he did not have permission from the military and knew he was breaching defence protocol about speaking to the media. In court on Wednesday, he sought, and was granted, a certificate against self-incrimination on that evidence. Person 7 said he, and other senior soldiers within the SAS, raised issues with the regimental command as early as 2013 about allegations of war crimes being committed by Australian soldiers, about instances of bullying within the SAS, and the erroneous awarding of decorations, including “questions” over Roberts-Smith’s Victoria Cross. “At one point the RSM [Regimental Sergeant Major] said to me, ‘what are you hoping to get out of this?’. I said ‘it’s not what I want to get out of this, it’s what needs to be done’.” Person 7 said in July 2012, he and Roberts-Smith were in the troops’ “ready room” preparing their equipment for battle. Days earlier, SAS Sergeant Blaine Diddams, who was part of the outgoing deployment, had been killed. Person 7 said Roberts-Smith said to him, unprompted: “Hey mate, I’m going to talk the talk, I want you to make sure I walk the walk. Before this trip’s over I’m going to choke a man to death with my bare hands, I’m going to watch the life drain out of his eyes.” Person 7 said he replied: “We’ve got to switch on here RS.

I never have and I never will.” Person 7 told the court he served alongside Roberts-Smith on a 2010 mission to Deh Rafshan area in Uruzgan province, targeting a “medium value” Taliban leader. During the mission, as Australian troops secured a compound, Person 7 said he and another soldier found an unarmed man sitting in the corner of a room. As the Australian soldiers approached him, the man rolled onto his side and “started to make a whimpering-type sound”. Person 7 told the court “this bloke was in serious fear, I couldn’t prise him from the foetal position he had gone into”. “In my assessment he was extremely scared, he posed no threat whatsoever.” He said he wanted to give the man “a moment to calm down” before they tried again to detain him. “At that point, BRS [Roberts-Smith] walked into the room, walked past us, then delivered three to four quickfire punches into the side of the Afghan’s head – then two knees to the Afghan’s chest or stomach area. “I yelled ‘woah, woah, woah, what are you doing? We’re looking after this. Get out of here’.” “RS left the room, he didn’t say anything.” Person 7 told the court Roberts-Smith was wearing kevlar gloves when he assaulted the man, and he saw the man’s face beginning to swell up. In another incident, in 2012, Person 7 said he saw Roberts-Smith repeatedly “jumper-punch” an Afghan man who had been detained, while a small girl, “aged three or four” watched on crying. Person 7 said he asked Roberts-Smith why he was assaulting the man, and Roberts-Smith allegedly replied the man had “hesitated” when Roberts-Smith had asked the man if the girl was his daughter and what her name was. Person 7 said Roberts-Smith told him: “He’s a fucking bad cunt.” Person 7 also told the court Roberts-Smith had bullied fellow Australian soldiers who he regarded as “cowards” or not up to the standards of an SAS soldier. Person 7 said Roberts-Smith repeatedly denigrated some soldiers, and sought to have them removed from service, or taken off deployments. During an extensive cross-examination, Arthurs Moses SC, acting for Roberts-Smith, put it to Person 7 he was “consumed by hatred” for the VC winner, and had spent years trying to besmirch his reputation. “I don’t hate RS whatever,” Person 7 said. “Do you accept you were engaged in character assassination of Mr Roberts-Smith?” Moses asked. “Everything I said was based on personal experience I’d had with him.” Person 7 fought alongside Roberts-Smith at Tizak in 2010, the battle for which Roberts-Smith was awarded the VC. Person 7 told the court he did not consider Roberts-Smith “a hero”, and said: “I formed the opinion that he did not deserve the Victoria Cross”. Roberts-Smith, in his evidence, denied ever bullying comrades and allegations that he assaulted any prisoners, or committed war crimes. “I spent my life fighting for my country and I did everything I possibly could to ensure I did it with honour,” he told the court last year. Roberts-Smith said the allegations against him were “false”, “baseless” and “completely without any foundation in truth”. Person 7 remains in the witness box.

3/16/2022,"It was midnight, hours before the floods hit Lismore, and Naomi Moran was in the Koori Mail’s office, working frantically to save an Indigenous institution. The newspaper’s three-storey building, perched perilously close to the swelling Wilsons River, was expected to be flooded, just as it was in 2017. The general manager, Moran, and her team had followed the advice of emergency services to the letter, moving important documents above the then-predicted flood levels. But at midnight, when the true scale of the impending disaster became apparent, Moran, her husband and several friends realised it was not going to be enough. They made a mad dash to the office and were left with just an hour to get all of the newspaper’s computers, hard drives and servers to the third floor. “What was precious to us was what’s on those computers because that’s all our page layouts, basically everything that we need to print a paper,” Moran, a Dunghutti and Nyangbal/Arakwal woman of the Bundjalung nation, tells Guardian Australia. If the third floor were lost, she says, the Koori Mail would be wiped out for up to a year. That would have dealt a devastating financial blow to Australia’s only fully Indigenous-owned and -managed newspaper, which returns its profits to Aboriginal communities. “I just remember Monday, just monitoring all the reports, trying to see snippets of buildings from helicopter footage on the news to see if we could see the Koori Mail building,” she says. “Just that anxiety around ‘did it get to that third floor?’, that’s all that I was worried about.” It wasn’t until Tuesday that Moran saw the images. The building was hit hard. The first and second floors were both destroyed. The paper’s print archive was among the areas wiped out. “Every single edition in paper printed by the Koori Mail in the last 30 years – completely gone,” Moran says. “There was a $20,000 Albert Namatjira original – probably worth more – floating around there. Just gone.” Thankfully, the third floor was spared. But the damage is such that, for the first time in its 30-year history, the Koori Mail has been forced to temporarily stop publishing. Each issue that doesn’t go to print costs it between $60,000 to $100,000, Moran says. “Thirty years of Koori Mail being the voice of Indigenous Australia and all of a sudden that voice stops,” she says. “It’s obviously affected us as a business and a product as a newspaper, but it’s obviously affecting our readers around the nation that rely on us as a source of information and storytelling, that’s our cultural responsibility and for that to be taken away from us in that way is really tragic.” While the paper gets back on its feet, its staff have found other ways to serve their region. Koori Mail employees quickly organised food and supply drops to nearby Indigenous communities – including around Muli Muli and Tabulam – which lost road access to major population centres. From their underground storage area, the team also set up what they’ve dubbed the “Koori Coles”, a flood relief centre open to Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities alike. “It’s not just about your groceries and your cleaning products, your bedding and your clothes, it’s a holistic approach to what the community needs. We’ve got a medical team here, we’ve got health and wellbeing, we’ve got massage therapists and people doing body work.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “People are going through the most traumatic time in their lives, and a pair of gumboots and a spray bottle is not going to cut it.” Many of the paper’s staff are working and volunteering at a time of immense personal loss. The acting editor, Darren Coyne, lost his home and had to be rescued during the floods. Now he’s now working furiously to get the paper back on track. They hope to resume printing resume in April. “For the first time in history, even though we are 100% self-funded, we need people to hold our hand during this process,” Moran says. “Hold our hand, support where possible, whether it’s contributing to the Koori Mail rebuild fund, taking a bit of pressure off, and making sure we can rebuild our office.”",News/Australia news,One frantic hour: the race to save the Koori Mail from rapidly rising flood waters,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/16/one-frantic-hour-the-race-to-save-the-koori-mail-from-rapidly-rising-flood-waters
3/16/2022,"It has become a source of dark irony among climate activists globally that court decisions denying their search for climate action begin by recognising the existential risk posed by the climate crisis. And so it went on Tuesday, when the full federal court delivered its judgment in the landmark Sharma case. “The threat of climate change and global warming was and is not in dispute between the parties in this litigation,” began chief justice James Allsop. What, then, does the judiciary – the third, independent and co-equal branch of government – propose to do about it? In the face of crippling climate inaction from the federal executive and legislative government that threatens to render Australia effectively uninhabitable in the centuries ahead, how will the courts react? On Tuesday, the full federal court overturned a landmark earlier decision that found the federal environment minister owed a duty of care to Australian children to mitigate climate risk in considering whether to approve a major coalmine expansion. Each writing separately, the three judges – Allsop, Michael Wheelahan and Jonathan Beach – accepted the minister’s appeal in a nearly 300-page judgment. “We are dealing with core, indeed, high policy-making,” wrote Allsop in deciding that the claim was not suited for judicial determination. “To the extent that the evidence and the uncontested risks of climate catastrophe call forth a duty of the minister or the executive of the commonwealth, it is a political duty: to the people of Australia,” he added. It is cold comfort for future generations who will suffer because of the government’s failure to fulfil that duty today. Much will be written in the weeks, months and years ahead about this significant moment for climate litigation in Australia. My comments are necessarily preliminary. But my overarching reaction is one of despair. Sharma is a judgment founded on centuries of jurisprudence – that, of course, is one of the strengths of the common law. But the common law evolves. Australia, and the world, has never faced a challenge of this nature. If not now, in light of all we know about climate harm and the government’s climate inaction (including, relevantly in the present case, approving a coalmine that will lead to an additional 100 million tonnes of carbon dioxide), then when? Tuesday’s judgment was not all bad news. The considerable divergence between the three judges meant that this was not a slam-dunk for the government, an immovable obstacle to future claims. While Allsop appeared most concerned that the question was primarily a political rather than a judicial one, echoed to a lesser extent by Wheelahan, Beach rejected this line of argument. “In summary, I accept that policy questions are involved. But whatever they may be, they can adequately be dealt with,” he held. Instead, Beach rejected the case on more technical legal grounds. That leaves the door open to future claims, perhaps more narrowly framed, succeeding. Indeed, all three judges highlighted their desire to avoid foreclosing future litigation; they have sought further submissions about the resolution of the case, to “ensure that” other climate litigants are not “unduly prejudiced” by the outcome. There were also tea leaves from the three judges, even Allsop, about the possibility of a duty of care where there is closer nexus between the risk and the harm (he used the example of the government approving an asbestos mine near a large city). Such comments will no doubt be explored in future litigation. First, though, the plaintiffs in Sharma will consider whether to appeal to the high court. In that consideration they will take heart from Beach, the most sympathetic of the appeal bench to their claim. Noting that some of the legal concepts that stood in the way of the teenage plaintiffs “in their present form may have reached their shelf life”, he mused that “it is for the high court not us to engineer new seed varieties for sustainable duties of care”. Whether in Sharma or another case, Australia’s climate inaction will soon reach the nation’s highest court. In that context, some of the comments in Tuesday’s judgment about institutional restraint will be less applicable – the high court can, and does, rewrite the law. It should do so. It is often said that hard cases make bad law. There is no doubt that the issues posed in Sharma are immensely difficult – perhaps the most challenging that courts will ever face. Reasonable minds disagree about the extent of appropriate judicial intervention in the climate crisis. But what is most dispiriting about the Sharma decision is that in seeking to respect institutional boundaries, it goes a large way towards abandoning the field altogether. Climate (in)action is political, Allsop held, and courts should leave such policy-making to politicians. In the ultimate analysis, what is the point of our law, if not to protect Australians from the most significant existential risk ever faced? What is the point of our constitution if Australia becomes all-but uninhabitable – a land of fire, flood and drought?

3/16/2022,"A strange, sad fashion month had its coda on Tuesday night, with the presentation of Alexander McQueen’s autumn/winter collection in a warehouse in Brooklyn, New York City. Models walked around large piles of artfully arranged mulch which, the brand’s creative director Sarah Burton said backstage, were made from trees that had “fallen down naturally” and would afterwards be donated to farms and artists’ projects. She added that 85% of the collection was produced from “sustainable, recyclable fabrics,” including all of the polyester. The collection was heavy on reliable hits: ruffled ballgowns paired with ankle boots, trench coats, trouser suits with exaggerated shoulders. There were also punk references – leather jackets and fraying, holey, oversized knits – that recalled the work of the brand’s founder, Lee McQueen. A handful of looks used a printed fabric inspired by the dress famously spray painted by robots live on the runway in 1999, as part of McQueen’s Collection No. 13. Bright block colours – acid yellow, tomato red and tangerine – were taken from photographs of mushrooms, “the incredible colours that you get in nature,” Burton said. In notes distributed at the show, Burton explained that her overall inspiration was mycelium, the root-like filaments of a fungus. “Mycelium has the most profound, interconnecting power, relaying messages through a magical underground structure, allowing trees to reach out to each other when either they or their young need help or are sick,” she said. Celebrating community and interconnectedness now, she added, seemed “more important than ever.” Mushrooms and mycelium fabrics have been hailed as a sustainable alternative to leather, but none were used in the collection, though Burton said the company had been trailing them and hoped to use them in the future. “It’s working,” she said, “but we didn’t want to do it until we had enough product.” Burton took over from Lee McQueen, after 14 years as his right hand woman, after the designer’s death in 2010. Since then, under Burton and luxury conglomerate Kering, which has owned the brand since 2001, it has expanded into more commercial categories, including accessories and footwear. Now, the once anti-establishment label is a royal favourite: Burton designed the Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding dress in 2011. Earlier this month the Duchess wore a light blue jumper by the label – to match a blue and yellow Ukrainian flag pin – on a visit to London’s Ukrainian Cultural Centre. In April, chief executive Emmanuel Gintzburger said he wanted to make Alexander McQueen “one of the most powerful luxury houses in the world”. The brand’s decision to cleave from the traditional fashion week schedule, to show collections in impactful moments – and locations – of its own choosing, as with Tuesday’s New York show, appears to be part of that plan. This latest round of fashion shows often felt surreal and jarring, taking place as war broke out in Ukraine. Ukrainian models and fashion editors were stranded in western Europe, while questions were raised about the industry’s patronage by Russian oligarchs. At the beginning of March, Alexander McQueen’s parent company Kering shut its Russian shops and online operations, as did LVMH brands including Dior, as well as H&M, Chanel and Hermes. Russian consumers account for about 3% of global luxury sales.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Nature looms large at Alexander McQueen’s autumn/winter show in New York,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/mar/16/nature-looms-large-at-alexander-mcqueens-autumnwinter-show-in-new-york
3/16/2022,"After two years of Covid and now Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the resilience of the global interlinked supply chains is being continually tested. Now China’s zero Covid strategy is being challenged for the first time since the virus was first detected in the central city of Wuhan, with outbreaks in many cities. How might the outbreak and subsequent severe lockdowns affect Australia, which relies on China as its biggest trade partner by far? And could there be a further twist if Beijing’s close ties to Moscow end up snaring China’s economy in the growing web of international sanctions over Russia’s war? More than 5,000 new cases were reported by the Chinese government on Tuesday, the most since the early days of the Wuhan outbreak, according to Bloomberg. The list of regions with tight lockdowns already include the southern technology hubs of Shenzhen and Dongguan, covering 23 million people between them, and the north-eastern province of Jilin, with a similar number of residents. Add in megacities such as Shanghai and provincial capitals like Xi’an, and large parts of the economy are suddenly in hibernation. As #China’s officials continue to pursue a “zero-#Covid” strategy aiming for elimination in each outbreak, there’re more than 50 million residents under strict, stay at home, lockdown today. Then add those under softer “quasi-lockdown” measures that’s more like 90 million people. Betty Wang, ANZ’s senior economist in Hong Kong, says the lockdowns will certainly dent the economy. “A one-week lockdown of the affected areas could cause [a drop of] as much as 0.8 percentage points in GDP growth,” Wang says. That’s significant given the government’s predicted growth rate of 5.5% for 2022. ANZ is predicting a 5% growth rate is more likely. But, as in Australia, Beijing is not sitting back. It’s planning a ¥2.5tn (A$500bn) tax cut and rebate plan to stoke growth among other support, Wang says. Disruptions in Shenzhen, dubbed China’s Silicon Valley, will send wide ripples. Foxconn, an assembler of iPhones, suspended production, helping to send Apple shares lower on Monday before they rebounded during trading on Tuesday. Toyota and Volkswagen, which have plants in Jilin, were among other firms affected. Effects, though, should prove temporary – provided the lockdowns aren’t prolonged, Wang said. The current state of the Chinese economy going into the Covid lockdown, though, was already mixed. After the first two months of 2022, the economy performed better than expected in areas such as spending on so-called fixed assets such as roads, with 12.2% growth – more than double the 5% pace economists predicted. Retail sales grew 6.7%, or twice the 3% rate forecast, while even investment in the debt-wracked property sector rose almost 4% when a fall of 7% was tipped, according to CBA senior Asia economist Kevin Xie. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The one weak spot in [Tuesday’s] data was a lift in the surveyed jobless rate to 5.5%, indicating increased stress in the labour market,” Xie said. “We expect consumption, the weak spot over the past two years, will again be hurt the most compared to production and exports in March,” he said. “Moreover, the continued weakness in the property sector, elevated geopolitical tensions, and tighter regulations in the tech sector continue to weigh on economic growth.” Those geopolitical tensions include China’s close relations with Russia. Speculation that the US might retaliate if Beijing goes out of its way to help Moscow, including undermining sanctions, has already hurt Chinese firms listed on US markets and more could follow. It’s “another black swan” that needs watching closely, the ANZ’s Wang says. As a close ally of the US, Australia would be expected to echo any sanctions imposed on China or Chinese companies for helping Russia, much as it joined the US in banning Russian oil imports. But unlike sanctions against Russia, such a move against China would have a dramatic impact on Australia’s economy. In the meantime, there are some positives for Australian exporters. Every time China’s economy stumbles, the government amps up spending on roads, bridges and other buildings, moves that tend to boost demand for raw materials. That helps commodity exporters such as Australia, where higher iron ore or other material prices boost corporate profits and bolster budget coffers. The tax take for Australian governments rises about $2bn for every 10% rise in global coal and gas prices, Chris Richardson, a senior economist at Deloitte, says. He adds that the boost from rising iron ore prices could be even greater, assuming they go up and stay up. But for Australian businesses, Covid-related lockdowns risk a further deterioration of already critical supply constraints, says Andrew McKellar, chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The ACCI-Westpac Survey of Industrial Trends, released on Tuesday, showed Australian manufacturers are facing the worst material shortages since the 1974 oil shock. Profits will suffer from any more disruptions if input costs rise more than they can pass on, he said. “International supply chain bottlenecks are producing material constraints on a scale not seen in almost 50 years,” McKellar says. “The Chinese lockdowns reaffirm the need to continue diversification of critical supply chains, ensuring that Australian businesses can source key components of production.”",News/Business,What could China’s zero Covid strategy mean for Australian business?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/16/what-could-chinas-zero-covid-strategy-mean-for-australian-business
