5/15/2022,"Julia Cheng’s choreography for Cabaret is one of the most distinctive aspects of Rebecca Frecknall’s multi-award-winning production. She has also been involved in encouraging the exceptional finalists of the BBC’s Young Dancer 2022, which reached its inspiring conclusion last weekend with a worthy winner in the joyful 17-year-old Adhya Shastry. Cheng, like Shastry, is clearly a woman to watch. Her quality and originality are obvious. But although Warrior Queens, created for her own House of Absolute company, is a labour of love developed over many years, which grew out of the Sadler’s Wells Breakin’ Convention festival in 2016, it feels less innovative than Cheng is. Inspired by female fighters as disparate as Mulan and Virginia Woolf’s Orlando, it opens with the powerful image of spotlit figures, each in an individual cone of light (courtesy of lighting designer Joshie Harriette), raising their arms, hands flexed, like a row of statues. As it progresses, those striking moments continue but never quite cohere. The movement becomes more cliched – there’s a lot of stamping, legs in wide pliés, from its six-strong female cast performing with savage authority. Beibei Wang’s percussion challenges the Sadler’s Wells sound system with its ferocity. The Matsena brothers – Anthony and Kel, born in Zimbabwe and raised in Wales – fill the second half of the programme with Shades of Blue, a bold new response to Black Lives Matter. This is also wonderfully lit (this time by Ryan Joseph Stafford) and superbly danced with huge commitment from its cast of nine. The movement is a compelling mixture of street and contemporary, hyper-flexible bodies falling and rising in fluid groupings, embodying authoritarian aggressors and those they attack. At one point the dancers seem threatened by their environment itself, as the stage lighting rig comes crashing down, pinning them in a crouch beneath its blue glare. At another, they stagger across the stage, from light to dark, accelerating from extreme slo-mo to rapid run. They fall to the ground as if shot, and then spring up as if pulled by strings. In the longest and most powerful section they form a square and obey the commands of a voice yelling instructions – “Intimidate!” “Confront!” – mimicking the actions demanded. Suddenly, one figure – Kel Matsena – who has seemed a leader, rapping about freedom and revolution, is left isolated after an impossible stream of demands at increasing speed. What begins as vaguely humorous becomes intensely chilling as he struggles to do the right thing, terror seeping into his limbs. It reminded me of debbie tucker green’s ear for eye, with its haunting documentation of the impossibility of a black man doing anything to protect himself from danger. Every move is somehow wrong; Matsena’s prone body lying still on stage, even during the curtain call, is a terrible reminder of trauma. It’s an impressive piece. The raw passion and sheer talent that propels the work makes you want to see more from both the Matsenas and Cheng. They feel like something new.",Arts/Stage,Shades of Blue/ Warrior Queens review – compelling and contemporary,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/15/shades-of-blue-anthony-and-kel-matsena-brothers-review-warrior-queens-julia-cheng-sadlers-wells
5/15/2022,"This week I want to tell you about a new chocolate company, launched earlier this year, called Bantu. Although the chocolate is made in London, the cocoa beans come from Cameroon, where its founder, Veronique Mbida, was born, in Yaoundé (she now lives in the UK, via France and Brazil). The Bantu farm belongs to Veronique’s mother and all the cocoa grown there – she started planting the cocoa that these bars are made from in 2016 – is made into Bantu chocolate, so it’s a fairly closed-loop system. Veronique knows all of the nine people who work there regularly; all of whom are paid three times the Fairtrade equivalent. I like this idea of a mother-and-daughter duo, completely in control of their cocoa and chocolate-bar production. The chocolate is also wonderful. Each bar is made in very small batches of 150 – Veronique hopes to expand that to 250 at a time, but if it’s sold out when you get to the website, be patient. The bars I tasted included Limbe, which I loved. It’s a delicious, creamy, coconut-milk 55% bar (the coconut is subtle, unlike some other vegan milk bars) – thoroughly recommend this. Nostradamus is a 38% dairy-free white chocolate; caramelised and with cocoa nibs and hibiscus, so it’s got a very sweet edge and is different to anything I’ve tasted before. There are also 66%, 73% and 83% bars. I’ve got my eye on the 66% Makossa as it has caramelised peanuts and hazelnuts. Each 70g bar is £8, and the website gives a breakdown of the costs and ethical concerns involved in producing chocolate.

5/15/2022,"What do you get if you cross an Australian ballroom dancing teacher with the owner of a little cinema? Genetically speaking, the answer comes in the flamboyant shape of Baz Luhrmann, the music-loving director of Strictly Ballroom and Moulin Rouge!, who learned to tango with his mother and watched films on the screen his father owned in the tiny town of Herons Creek. Born Mark Anthony Luhrmann in Sydney in 1962, he is already the creator of a handful of exuberant popular hits, and is now telling the story of Elvis Presley, one of the most vivid – not to say lurid – of all real-life narratives. His biopic, Elvis, which stars 30-year-old Austin Butler in the lead role and Tom Hanks as the singer’s calculating manager, Colonel Tom Parker, has its world premiere on 25 May at the Cannes film festival. A lengthy crescendo of public interest followed the birth of the project eight years ago, with original candidates for the title role reportedly including Harry Styles. Anticipation levels rose further early in 2020 when filming in Australia was interrupted because Covid struck Hanks. And excitement was stoked once again early this month when the film won the public approval of Presley’s widow. Luhrmann, looking brightly tanned at New York’s Met Gala, posed on the red carpet with Priscilla Presley, who later tweeted after a private screening of Elvis: “I relived every moment in this film. It took me a few days to overcome the emotions. Beautifully done Baz.” Presley’s daughter, Lisa Marie, also loved it, Priscilla revealed, adding that she was sure his granddaughter, actor Riley Keough, would feel the same. The film should spark some stellar Hollywood voltage on the fabled Croisette this festival, as Cannes shakes off its pandemic gloom. And the premiere of Elvis, though not in competition for the Palme d’Or, will mark a key moment in a festival where big-screen appreciations of rock heroes are prominent. On Sunday 22 May, Ethan Coen, one half of the famous film-making brothers, makes his solo film debut with a documentary about another American rock titan, Jerry Lee Lewis. His film, Trouble in Mind, charts the unruly career of the musician they called “Killer”. On Monday 23 May, a David Bowie documentary, Moonage Daydream, made by Brett Morgen, also has a world premiere. Its American director, who has already made Montage of Heck about Kurt Cobain, spent four years compiling hours of unseen Bowie footage for this “experiential cinematic odyssey”. Music documentaries took hold of the film industry after the 2012 success of Searching for Sugarman. Last year’s Summer of Soul met with acclaim, and there was a joyful response to Edgar Wright’s Sparks brothers film. This festival, the annual Cannes Classics line-up will honour Martin Scorsese’s admired masterpiece of the genre, his 1978 documentary about the Band, The Last Waltz. A parallel boom in rock biopics has seen portrayals of Freddie Mercury, Hank Williams, Aretha Franklin, Elton John and Morrissey all whizzing off the production line. But Luhrmann promises something bolder and more colourful. As a director tackling probably the most significant events in commercial pop history, he knew he “couldn’t make this film if the casting wasn’t absolutely right”. “We searched thoroughly for an actor with the ability to evoke the singular natural movement and vocal qualities of this peerless star, but also the inner vulnerability,” he has said. Luhrmann, by the way, also set himself the tricky task of finding a convincing BB King, Sister Rosetta Tharpe and Little Richard for the Elvis cast. But then music is in the bones of this son of the ballroom-dancing dress shop owner Barbara and her late husband, Leonard Luhrmann, a Vietnam vet who ran a farm and a petrol station (as well as a cinema). Their boy loved music and dancing and, as an adult, has earned Grammy nominations for his film soundtracks, as well as some acclaim as an opera director. In the early 90s, his Australian production of Benjamin Britten’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream won the Critic’s Prize at the Edinburgh festival, and in 2002 he brought Puccini’s La Bohème to Broadway, where it received seven Tony nominations. Coupled with his love of high fashion, Luhrmann’s passion for music has fed lavish advertising campaigns for Chanel, as well as promotional films celebrating designers Miuccia Prada and Elsa Schiaparelli. “I’ve always been spread too thin,” Luhrmann has admitted. Yet there is another string to his bow that only viewers of the Australian TV drama, A Country Practice in the 1980s, may recall. Luhrmann started out as an actor, graduating from Sydney’s National Institute of Dramatic Art in 1985. Even before then, at 18, he had played small roles in a few episodes of the daytime soap. By then he was already “Baz”, not “Mark”. He had initially been nicknamed by bullies at school in a reference to Basil Brush, the British children’s TV puppet character. “I had this crazy curly hair, this big ’fro, and at school all these boys used to beat the shit out of me,” the director has recalled. With impressive teenage bravado he responded by changing his name by deed poll to Bazmark, linking the taunt for ever to his birth name and effectively launching a creative brand on the world. When fame came it came fast and suddenly, at 30, with the release of Strictly Ballroom, the first of Luhrmann’s “Red Curtain Trilogy” of films. Whatstarted as a short theatre piece at drama school became a quirky cult cinematic hit, later changing mainstream TV entertainment by inspiring the BBC to revamp its defunct ballroom show as Strictly Come Dancing. For Luhrmann, the film “was the first step in that sort of 10-year journey to make musical cinematic language”. Next came his vibrant vision of Shakespeare’s Romeo + Juliet in 1996. Critics tend to point to this one as his true masterpiece, and certainly the director is still a little in love with it. Recently he described it as “the most romantic film-making experience I’ve ever had”, adding: “Someone should make a film about us making that film. Can you imagine? Leo DiCaprio was 19, we’re all living in Mexico, there are helicopters and explosions and we’re doing iambic pentameter!” A year after it came out, Luhrmann married the production designer, Catherine Martin, who has now won four Oscars on his films. The couple have two children and have spoken of maintaining an unconventional domestic set-up, living separately during the week and meeting in hotels at the weekend. In 2001, Luhrmann came into full popular focus when he gave cinema audiences Jim Broadbent singing Madonna’s Like a Virgin in Moulin Rouge!. It starred Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, and so far has won him the most accolades, including eight Oscar nominations. The last of his Red Curtain trio, he sees it as rooted in the expressive grandeur of 1940s Hollywood: “It’s a heightened theatrical cinematic language, which I like to think of as a big lie that reveals a big truth.” From then on, the critical reception of Luhrmann’s work has proved less reliable. He keeps a little notebook of ideas for projects but recent choices have not flown so high. His 2008 historical saga, Australia, once again starring Kidman but this time alongside their compatriot Hugh Jackman, did well in Europe, but the critics did not rave. His most recent film, a 3D version of F Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby, with Leonardo DiCaprio as the glamorous anti-hero, was also disliked by many reviewers. It did, however, bring in three times its estimated budget of $105m at the box office. Last year, The Get Down, his expensive Netflix series on the origins of hip-hop in the 1970s, was culled after a single season. With Luhrmann it is all or nothing, it seems. And it is a creative philosophy he appears to extend to his audiences. In defence of the full-on style of the startling opening scenes of Moulin Rouge!, Luhrmann has argued that a slow, naturalistic approach would have been lame: “While you’re chatting and eating your popcorn, you’re just getting a bunch of facts and figures so the film can start. In our film, we’re demanding that you say, ‘Are you in or are you out?’” Next week will reveal which way the Cannes audience for Elvis has opted.",Arts/Film,"Baz Luhrmann, flamboyant director of Moulin Rouge! and Romeo and Juliet, turns focus to Elvis",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/15/baz-luhrmann-flamboyant-director-of-moulin-rouge-and-romeo-and-juliet-turns-focus-to-elvis
5/15/2022,"Whenever Boris Johnson’s government wades into battle over the Northern Ireland protocol, it wields one assertion like a broadsword: that the protocol is ruining the region’s economy. Checks on goods entering Northern Ireland are disrupting trade, increasing prices and bankrupting businesses, and the damage will worsen unless the protocol is changed, goes the argument. The Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), a rightwing thinktank, joined the fray last week with a report that estimated the annual cost of the agreement at £850m. “It underlines the many costs of the current situation – economic, fiscal, and in trade diversion,” said David Frost, the government’s former Brexit negotiator. “If the EU will not negotiate, then the government will be right to intervene unilaterally to restore stability.” The problem with this justification for slashing the protocol – and risking a trade war with the EU – is that it is bogus. A growing body of evidence suggests Northern Ireland has adapted and started to profit from its new situation, with the benefits of full access to the EU single market and the rest of the UK outweighing the costs of administering checks on some goods entering the region from Great Britain. “Every piece of evidence presented so far shows a positive impact,” said Stephen Kelly, head of Manufacturing Northern Ireland (MNI). The protocol initially disrupted supply lines but is now cushioning the region from the costs of Brexit, he said. “Our members have largely gotten to grips with it. Three-quarters of them say there are opportunities and [they] are grasping those opportunities.” Kelly called the IEA report “bunkum” – an extrapolation from a handful of businesses that overlooks wider evidence. MNI estimates the annual cost of administering protocol-related checks at £200m. This is dwarfed by Northern Ireland’s extra £1bn in trade with the Republic, plus its extra trade, yet to be calculated, with other EU countries, said Kelly. Stuart Anderson, a spokesperson for Northern Ireland’s Chamber of Commerce, said the protocol affected different sectors in different ways, good and bad, and that overall business sentiment was positive. “We’re seeing an improving picture. About 65% of members say despite initial headaches they have adapted well,” he said. Just 8% of members reported serious problems. Anderson said it was difficult to say if the protocol was a net plus or minus since its costs blurred into global supply chain costs. Data gives reason for optimism. Manufacturing jobs are growing four times faster in Northern Ireland than the UK average. Since the middle of 2021 the region has recorded inflation below the UK average, with groceries 8% cheaper, according to analyst Kantar. A report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research last week said Northern Ireland’s economic output had slightly outperformed the UK average. “This is partly an outcome of the Northern Irish protocol and its special status in the Brexit arrangements, including better trade and investment conditions as part of the EU’s single market and customs union,” it said. “Closer links with the EU, through trade and also potentially labour mobility, have benefited Northern Ireland post-Brexit.” There are two caveats. One is that the protocol has not been fully implemented: more extensive and rigorous checks on British goods entering Northern Ireland would increase costs and disruption. The other is that the political battles over the protocol playing out in London, Brussels and Northern Ireland, where devolved government has collapsed, are hurting the region. “While this continues, the reputational damage to Northern Ireland as a place to invest and work grows daily,” said Paul Murnaghan, head of the Chamber of Commerce.",News/UK news,The Northern Ireland protocol is said to be a blight on regional economy.

5/15/2022,"The king of Bahrain is expected to attend the Royal Windsor horse show on Sunday after a personal invitation from the Queen, prompting anger from campaigners who claim the UK is “sportswashing” what they say is an increasingly repressive regime. King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa has been invited as a guest of the Queen, demonstrating a warmth of official ties despite the Middle Eastern state’s outlawing of political opposition, and human rights violations including torture. Ahead of the UK’s largest outdoor horse show, King Hamad offered congratulations to Vladimir Putin on Russia’s Victory Day, which was held last week. The Queen is expected to attend the horse show on Sunday to watch the platinum jubilee celebration in her honour. However, she will have to brave a protest, organised by the Campaign Against Arms Trade, that aims to highlight the event’s “sportswashing of human rights abuses in Bahrain”. Among those attending the protest are exiled activist Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, whose Bahraini citizenship was revoked after he previously protested against the king of Bahrain at the Windsor horse show and who is, in effect, stateless as a result. Alwadaei, director of the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, said: “While the people of Bahrain continue to live under the brutal repression of the Al Khalifa dictatorship, with prisons full of peaceful dissidents, once again the red carpet is being rolled out for King Hamad in the UK. His invitation to the Royal Windsor horse show is morally bankrupt and sends a clear signal that the UK is a safe haven for dictators and human rights abusers.” On Friday an open letter was sent to the Queen by five MPs, including former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and two peers, warning that welcoming the king was “a huge error of judgment and sends a devastating message to the victims of this brutal rule”. A separate letter, signed by international rights groups, was sent to sponsors of the horse show, including Land Rover and Rolex, raising concerns over what it described as a “textbook example of sportswashing”. Jeed Basyouni, who leads Reprieve’s Middle East team, said: “The UK welcomes King Hamad and agrees not to mention the people tortured into making false confessions by his security services. “And, each year, Bahrain’s rulers return home with the comforting thought that no matter how much pain they inflict on their people, they will still be feted in England.” The invitation to the king comes after the organisers of the Windsor event agreed to adopt a human rights policy following a complaint that the show is being exploited by the Bahrain royal family to distract from rights abuses. The death of Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, president of the UAE, on Friday may, however, persuade the king to fly back to the Gulf at short notice. Not only will the Gulf state’s king be present at Windsor but Bahrain’s Prince Nasser has also confirmed he will be attending. In 2014 the high court in London ruled that Prince Nasser bin Hamad Al Khalifa was not immune from prosecution over torture claims, allegations the Bahraini government categorically denied. Since the failed 2011 uprising, aimed at removing the ruling monarchy, Bahrain has been engaged in the repression of its Shia majority. Human rights groups claim the regime is using mass terrorism trials and the removal of citizenship to crack down on peaceful activists. Amnesty International’s latest assessment of Bahrain says that its government continued to commit serious human rights violations, “including torture and other ill-treatment as well as suppression of freedom of expression and assembly. Official investigations of ill-treatment resulted in impunity for perpetrators.”",News/World news,Exiles angry as Queen hosts king of Bahrain,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/15/exiles-angry-as-queen-hosts-king-of-bahrain
5/15/2022,"Jack Monroe has instructed libel lawyers after the Tory MP Lee Anderson alleged the writer and food blogger was profiteering from the poor. Monroe, who won a rancorous, high-profile libel action against the former Daily Mail columnist Katie Hopkins in 2017, tweeted that the MP’s comments were a “very clear cut case of outright libel”. Although not confirmed, the lawyer in question could be Mark Lewis who pioneered the phone-hacking claims that led to the closure of the News of the World. In a separate tweet, Monroe reached out to him: “got a job for you pal”. The row began after deputy leader of the Reclaim Party, Martin Daubney, posted a clip of an interview he had conducted with Anderson. At the start of the clip, Daubney refers to Monroe as the “self-appointed representative of the impoverished”, adding she has “sold loads of books. Done quite well out of it. No doubt, probably earns more than the prime minister”. Anderson responds by stating: “She’s taking money off some of the most vulnerable people in society and making an absolute fortune on [sic] the back of people.” Last week, the MP for Ashfield in Nottinghamshire provoked anger from opposition MPs and campaigners after stating in the Commons that food banks are unnecessary because the main cause of food poverty is a lack of cooking and budgetary skills. During the Queen’s speech debate last Wednesday, Anderson argued that nutritious meals could be easily cooked for 30p a time. Two days later, when the clip of the interview with Daubney was posted on the Reclaim party Twitter feed, Monroe quickly asked for it to be taken down, along with an apology, stating it had already received more than 19,000 views. By late Saturday afternoon, the clip was still up and had been viewed more than 800,000 times. Monroe tweeted that Anderson and Daubney were “playing a very expensive game of chicken with someone who has a proven track record of crossing this particular road without fear nor favour”. That particular road was a reference to Monroe’s victory in 2017 against Hopkins which saw the food writer awarded £24,000 damages after Hopkins suggested Monroe approved of defacing a war memorial during an anti-austerity demonstration in Whitehall. Even before Anderson and Daubney’s interview, Monroe appeared to be tiring of sniping critics, tweeting on Thursday: “Frothing right wingers so desperate to falsely prove that I’m a hypocritical millionaire that they’re willing to libel me extensively in order to try to make it happen. Beautiful.” Despite attracting considerable criticism for his opinions on food banks, Anderson stood by his views, calling their use “exaggerated” and saying: “I’m talking common sense.” On Thursday, he told Times Radio he was glad they had whipped up a furore. “The left will obviously jump on this, the mainstream media will jump on this, because at the moment all we’re hearing in chamber is ‘food-bank use is on the up,’” said the MP.",News/UK news,Jack Monroe to sue MP after he says ‘she makes fortune from the poor’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/15/food-writer-jack-monroe-sues-tory-mp-claims-she-makes-fortune-poor-lee-anderson
5/15/2022,"Most of us who spend our time reading books gobble up their verbal contents, then set aside or at best shelve the container. But those receptacles have an identity and existence of their own: with their upright spines, their paper layered like skin and their protective jackets, books possess bodies and wear clothing, and they enjoy adventures or suffer mishaps as they circulate around the world. Overlooking the epic bulk of Troilus and Criseyde, Chaucer addresses the poem as his “little book” and sends it off into the future with fond parental solicitude, while in Thackeray’s Vanity Fair the heroine begins her career of rebellion by hurling a copy of Samuel Johnson’s officious, prescriptive dictionary out of the window. In Portable Magic, Emma Smith wittily and ingeniously studies books as objects, possessed by readers not produced by writers. Her title, borrowed from an essay by Stephen King, emphasises the mobility of these apparently inert items and their occult powers. Like motorcars or metaphors, books transport us to destinations unknown, and that propulsion has something uncanny about it. Smith begins with sorcerers conjuring as they consult books of spells; she goes on to examine the varieties of magical reading, which range from the “spiritual transcendence” of Saint Augustine, who was converted by a random perusal of the Bible, to the “dark arts” of a “necromantic volume” such as Mein Kampf, distributed to all households during the Third Reich as a sinister talisman, the “bibliographic manifestation of Hitlerism”. In their packaging, early gospels brought heaven down to Earth, lettered in celestial gold and silver on regally purple parchment. Other books scrutinised by Smith have been desecrated or, as she cheekily puts it, “visually pimped”. Joe Orton and his lover Kenneth Halliwell were imprisoned for replacing illustrations in genteel books with homoerotic pinups, although the Islington library that had them prosecuted now displays the defaced copies as artistic treasures. Elsewhere, Smith locates books with an incendiary intent: a paperback murder mystery from the apartheid era in South Africa secretes a bomb-making manual inside, and a 17th-century Venetian missal encloses a boxed pistol with a silken bookmark that activates its trigger. Better these lethal boobytraps than the blandly curated shelves of Gwyneth Paltrow, whose interior designer supplied her with job lots of “blooks” chosen for the soothing colour of their spines. Etymologically, all books are analogues of the Bible, since the word “biblion” derives from a Semitic term for papyrus or scroll. On her way through the centuries, Smith teases some playful neologisms out of that ancient root. Fortune-tellers indulge in “bibliomancy” by opening books at random to find prophetic guidance, Orton’s indecent collages are described as a “creative biblioclasm”, and the disaster movie The Day After Tomorrow exhibits an act of “bibliocide” when books in the New York Public Library are incinerated for fuel during a new ice age. Best of all is Smith’s translation of the scholarly term incunabula as “biblio-babies”: these 15th-century printed books derive their name from the Latin for swaddling clothes or cradle, which makes them “infants from Gutenberg’s nursery”. Nearer to the present, mass-marketed books challenge readers to multiply in their own unmechanical way. “Paperbacks,” Smith declares, “were the baby-boomers of the book demographic, and Dr Spock’s The Pocket Book of Baby and Child Care was one of the new format’s first huge successes.” Smith reads with all her senses alert. She listens to pages rustling when turned, sniffs bindings like a winebibber relishing the bouquet of a vintage, and deliciously inhales the woody vanilla musk of cheap secondhand bookshops; she knows the recipes for making ink, which in the case of one Norse saga involved boiling the berries of an Arctic shrub. Indulgent about the rings left by coffee mugs, she also treasures the spattered sauce on her kitchen copy of Claudia Roden’s Med: books cater to every appetite. Although Smith defines herself as a “bookish academic”, she balks at Arcimboldo’s 16th-century portrait of “a man constructed from books”, with fluttery pages for hair, ribs made of stacked tomes, and bookmarks for fingers. The monstrous figure in the painting reminds her that “the book-human relationship is reciprocal: if we are made up of books, books are made up of us”. Proving the point, she notices that a small Spanish-language Bible confiscated from a migrant at the US border is “curved around the contours of a body”, having been stuffed in a pocket for comfort and companionship during the long trek north to the Rio Grande. In holding a book we clasp or embrace it or even nurse it on our laps: the meeting of minds relaxes into a closer communion, and when you finish Portable Magic its pages will be spotted with your fingerprints and dusted by traces of your DNA. Smith encourages this intimacy by puffing “Phew!” after a particularly strenuous page of argumentation and thanking readers who stay the course. Her wise, funny, endearingly personal book made me want to shake her hand, or give her a grateful, disembodied hug.

5/15/2022,"The T-shirt – that staple of summer style – has had an upgrade for 2022. The so-called “baby tee” – cropped, tight, often with a cutesy slogan, and last popular around the turn of the millennium – is back. Worn by celebrities including model Hailey Baldwin, singers Olivia Rodrigo and Charli XCX, as well as the cast of US teen TV drama Euphoria, the baby tee’s popularity is part of a wider return of noughties style for young fashion brands. Urban Outfitters, Fiorucci, Weekday, Praying, Vanna Youngstein and Heaven by Marc Jacobs all produce T-shirts in this cut. Resale app Depop say searches for the item peaked in April 2021, up 309% compared with the previous year. “Since January 2022, we have seen searches steadily rise again by 11%, showing that the baby tee is growing in popularity as we head into the summer months,” said Agustina Panzoni, Depop’s trends manager. The Heaven T-shirt with its teddy logo is a design particularly sought after. Jade Wickes at style magazine The Face calls baby tees “the staple of comfort dressing”. She says they are “definitely part of the nineties and Y2K revival alongside the ubiquitous popularity of skate style”, where the tees are typically worn with baggy trousers and an inch or two of midriff. The bare, honed midriff became a familiar sight– seen everywhere from the red carpet to pop videos and episodes of Friends. In recent years, fashion has covered up stomachs more, but it seems the midriff, as seen on the Miu Miu catwalk and beyond, has returned. “The midriff is back,” says Panzoni. “This time around, the trend is inclusive of all genders and body shapes.” Because baby tees now often come with slogans, Wickes sees them as a post-pandemic way to make a statement: “Their defining feature seems to be that they’re slapped with irreverent, tongue-in-cheek phrases which tend to reveal a bit about your personality. Having been masked up for the last couple of years, those slogans feel like a playful shorthand.” Vanna Youngstein’s baby tees feature cutesy slogans like “Dreaming of U” or “Bunny” – giving them an online-friendly, playful irony. The designer had seven of her designs featured in HBO’s Euphoria, with the “Don’t be jel” T-shirt worn by Alexa Demie’s character Maddy selling out. She agrees with Wickes: “I think that, due to the pandemic, people want an easy way of expressing their style. Baby tees are very reminiscent of the nineties and early noughties and are a way of referencing that with a new twist.” Youngstein namechecks the Spice Girls and short-lived british duo Shampoo, as well as Björk and American R&B singer Brandy, as her baby tee poster women. But this isn’t just a retro trend. “I love that they are simultaneously nostalgic and really modern looking. They are a casual way of summing up your style in one piece,” she said.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Abs fab: the midriff is back as baby tees send us on a trip to the 90s,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/may/15/abs-fab-the-midriff-is-back-as-baby-tees-send-us-on-a-trip-to-the-90s
5/15/2022,"In Pyongyang, Covid is spreading fast, and one capital where the North Korean disaster is surely being watched with rapt attention is Beijing. North Korea, like China, has made a virtue of its authoritarian system being better suited to Covid control than the democracies. Unlike North Korea, China has been rolling out vaccines for more than a year, but like its neighbour, it has millions of older people who have never taken the jab. China’s leaders can see in their neighbours a Covid situation that they fear could be their fate if the virus takes hold and they have responded with a lockdown in the mega-city of Shanghai that has lasted seven weeks and shows no immediate signs of ending. As locals stay confined to their homes, drones fly near apartment blocks, intoning the phrase: “Control your soul’s desire for freedom.” China can still argue that in absolute terms its “zero-Covid” policy has had remarkable success in preventing deaths. Last week, Joe Biden mourned the grim toll of a million American deaths from the disease, whereas China’s official figures suggest only 5,000 deaths in a population four times the size. Even if one assumes that the real figure is several times higher, it is still a remarkable achievement. But it has come at a price; there is no clear policy for how China can reopen its borders to live with a virus that scientists expect to become endemic, or how to deal with it, other than with repeated lockdowns that harm the fragile economy and have led to increased panic as whole households are taken to quarantine because one case has been detected in an apartment block. That reopening is unlikely to happen in 2022. One of the main reasons for keeping China’s doors closed is the need for a smooth ride toward the 20th party congress, which is likely to be in October, where Xi Jinping is set to be chosen for an unprecedented third term as China’s leader. The zero-Covid policy, in which the virus is to be eliminated from China, is personally associated with Xi and it would be immensely difficult to change the narrative before the congress. Therefore other ways of explaining the lockdown have taken hold. One is the story that China’s system allows a more efficient, if controversial, deployment of mass mobilisation combined with high-quality science. Social media has been filled with discussions of the “dabai”, literally “big whites”, health enforcement workers, dressed head to toe in white PVC PPE, who spray disinfectant in suspect households and who have the power to compel people into quarantine. For some, they are symbols of a futuristic modernity. Their critics say that they represent the faceless power of the authoritarian state that allows no appeal. However, the online discussion misses a key point: the dabai are just ordinary officials and workers. By deflecting attention to the harsh tactics of workers on the ground, the public is distracted from discussing the national-level policy (a discussion that censorship mostly prevents). Meanwhile, China continues to search for one possible solution to the long cycle of lockdowns: an effective Chinese mRNA vaccine that mimics the working of the highly effective Pfizer and Moderna jabs. China’s national pride means that it won’t import the western vaccines but, despite huge amounts of investment from state and private sector, its own labs have not yet come up with a Chinese equivalent. Several private sector pharmaceutical companies are reported to have mRNA vaccines in the test stage, but even when they are approved by the regulators, there still needs to be a national rollout and much more effort to get the elderly to take the vaccine. That points to a programme that could last well into 2023, if not longer. Meanwhile, the lockdowns are grinding down the economy, not just in Shanghai, but nationwide. The prime minister, Li Keqiang, said last week that China’s economic outlook was “complicated” and “grim”. Hu Chunhua, a vice-premier who some are tipping to move to a top seat on the elite standing committee of the politburo, has hinted that labour unrest is a real possibility and advocated stronger state support for groups in danger of unemployment. The danger of protest is real: during the privatisations of the 1990s, demonstrations in rustbelt cities such as Shenyang in the north-east showed popular feeling rising high as people realised their old factory jobs were doomed. The new generation of workers don’t expect jobs for life, but they do expect a predictable economic playing field, particularly if they work in China’s dynamic private sector. Covid has turned that predictability upside down. In the short term, in a year of significant domestic politics and turbulent economics, there are some advantages to keeping the doors shut. China isn’t dependent on tourism or foreign student numbers, it has very low immigration levels and it needs relatively few overseas executives to keep even its internationally oriented businesses going. Sectors that a few years ago would have needed significant input from outside, such as technology, are rapidly becoming indigenised. Yet a return to the days of chairman Mao’s Cultural Revolution, when China really was closed to the outside world, is unthinkable in the longer term. China needs to export and import, something hard to do while ports such as Shanghai are in near shutdown. More broadly, China has always done best when it has been most open to ideas and influences from the wider world. In the 1920s, Shanghai was the crucible of Chinese modernity, as its sophisticated young people drank French coffee, read Russian novels and dreamed of studying in America. It would be a bitter irony if the 2020s saw the same great cosmopolitan city forced to retreat in the face of an irrepressible virus, with the vibe not of Paris but of Pyongyang.

5/15/2022,"Close to the River Teme, in the shadow of the Malvern Hills, with three farm cats playing around our feet, Meg Edmonds is showing me around an old barn that she uses to store, arrange and wrap her flowers. It is busy with colour and life. There are tulips of every shade in crates, narcissi and ranunculi in buckets and vases. There are pots of snakeshead fritillary just outside the door, and a vase of blue and white anemones by the window, in water, so that Edmonds can make a note of how many times they open and close in the sun before they’re over. “I want to be able to tell people that information,” she says. They’re currently on number four. She pulls out a huge green stem that looks as if it has been ripped out of Jurassic Park. It turns out to be from an artichoke plant. There are dried artichokes elsewhere, their fluffy innards bursting out, to be used in dried arrangements over winter. We walk around the farm. Edmonds points out shrubs and trees that have ended up in her work, from a sumptuous trailing rosemary bush to the flowering branches of a crab apple tree. Everything here is useful. It has also been grown within walking distance, either on the family farm, or on a patch of land next to the farm shop, at the other end of the village, where Edmonds’s flowers sell in big, beautiful bunches. Edmonds and her husband farm livestock and vegetables on his family farm (they are third generation), and converted to organic practices 20 years ago. After moving away from selling the farm’s livestock to supermarkets, in favour of selling in their own farm shop, she started to think that there might be a way of doing the same for flowers. “I didn’t realise that there was this burgeoning market for local seasonal, mixed, beautiful things, like I had in my garden and like my friends raved over,” she says. Now she does arrangements for funerals, and occasionally for weddings, as well as the bunches in the shop and at farmers’ markets. Flowers are often at the centre of life’s biggest turning points, from birth to marriage to death, but, until recently, few would have asked questions about where those flowers came from and what the cost might be, beyond the price tag. “We ask our farmers to address these questions,” she says. Now, we can find out if meat or veg is organic, and where it was grown, and when. “But we don’t look at the most obvious thing, in the middle of our table, which is the bunch of flowers.” Flowers are big business in Britain: 50% of British households bought cut flowers in 2021. The pandemic disrupted growers and florists, both logistically and when events, such as weddings, ground to a halt, but people still bought flowers to stay connected to family members and friends. The mail-order company Bloom & Wild announced in 2021 that it had doubled its sales during the first year of the pandemic, with customers ordering flowers to send to loved ones as “somewhat of a substitute for a hug”. But according to Defra, only 14% of cut flowers sold in the UK are grown in Britain. The remaining 86% come from the Netherlands, or from warmer countries, such as Ecuador, Kenya and Ethiopia. In 2016, the National Farmers’ Union released an extensive report into the cut-flower industry in the UK, pointing out that the value of British cut flowers has remained largely the same since the late 1980s, rising from £79m in 1988 to £82m in 2015, while the value of imported flowers rose almost sixfold over that same period, from £122m to £666m. Supermarkets sell “seasonal” flowers, such as roses in February, without much explanation as to which country’s season that is, though it is safe to assume that roses are unlikely to be thriving in the cold British winter months. “It’s the one thing that just doesn’t cross people’s minds in the same way as it does with food and fashion,” says Olivia Wilson, a florist and grower who co-founded the SSAW Collective, a community of chefs, florists and growers, which advocates for progressive change in the food and flower industries. “For many years now, people have been able to get roses all year round, but that doesn’t reflect what true seasonality means. We’ve got the opportunity to have flowers that are seasonal and grown in the UK, from April to October or even November. The whole system could be worked differently to ensure that flowers are available, but in ways that are helpful to the environment rather than damaging.” While establishing the true carbon footprint of cut flowers is complex and requires a great many intricate factors to be taken into consideration, from growing conditions to climate to transportation and beyond, there is a simple way to hedge bets when it comes to what is best for the environment. “Buying from a local farmer is the most sustainable thing you can do,” says Edmonds. There are a growing number of local farmers to choose from. Flowers from the Farm, a non-profit organisation that was established in 2011, has doubled its membership over the past three years, and now works with more than 1,000 independent British growers. (Its website allows you to search for your nearest local flower farmer.) Many grow organically, peat-free and without pesticides, and use paper wrapping rather than plastic. I spoke to several of their members, and they all said that demand for their flowers had exploded. Partly, they put this down to a growing awareness of the environmental impact of the cut-flower industry. Much like food and fashion, there is an appetite for information about provenance and a desire to spend money more ethically, where possible. And in part, there is an aesthetic appeal, helped along by social media, and a trend towards a more bohemian, “garden-gathered” look, that finds beauty in less-than-straight ranunculi stems, for example, or more unusual varieties of flowers and foliage that a local farmer might specialise in. In 2008, after working as a designer and gardener in private gardens for many years, Rachel Siegfried established Green and Gorgeous in Oxfordshire, a farm over two acres that has flower fields, orchards, vegetable and herb beds, and chickens. She also teaches in-demand courses on floriculture and floristry, which regularly sell out. “There was the slow-food movement, and the farmers’ markets were going strong, and people loved buying their locally grown veg, but you’d go to the market and you’d never see flowers,” she recalls. “I could count on one hand the number of people I know who were doing it in the UK.” She suspects people just didn’t know where cut flowers came from, and in the early days of setting up as a grower, she struggled to find florists who would take her produce. “I really tried. I went around all my local florists with a van full of beautiful flowers. But they didn’t want to know. I remember one having a huge go at me about ants on the peonies,” she laughs. Why didn’t they want to know then, when they do now? “They knew my flowers would be more expensive. And they also knew I could not guarantee consistent supply,” Siegfried explains, though she says Brexit has made importing flowers more costly. Farming in Britain has its particular demands and complications, of course, and that applies to flowers, too. The climate is unpredictable, and global warming has exacerbated its unpredictability. When we spoke, in early April, Siegfried had just had a -5C frost. “When I’m teaching, one of the main things I say is that you must manage your customers’ expectations, because you can’t manage the weather.” If she is supplying a wedding, she never promises a specific flower. “I’m very cagey. I try to work with people’s colours. Because of course, at this time of year, flowering time can change by up to a month.” Anaïs Carrillo-Hawkins is entering her first full season as a grower. A Mexican-American woman, originally from Texas, she had been looking for land to start her own flower farm ever since she moved to the UK 11 years ago. She studied horticulture in Texas and has a family background in farming, but worked in the charity sector for a number of years, for Unicef and Save the Children. During the pandemic, she made the decision to set up Dulce and Flor, combining flower farming and her other passion, baking. The land she farms, in the Chilterns, has its own microclimate, she explains, and one of the biggest challenges has been learning to deal with the local wildlife. As we speak she spots a red kite, which stops her in her tracks: she explains that it could mean that the kite has spotted a mouse. “It’s been a real learning curve, despite having a background in horticulture,” she says. “It’s pretty high risk. In Texas, we had hurricanes that would come in during the summer months, all through your main cropping season. But here it seems as if climate change is getting even harder to predict. When you’re working with clients, it’s hard to predict when your crop is going to be ready to sell to them.” Imports are probably more reliable, she admits. But buying locally, and seasonally, is about far more than a guarantee of uniform arrangements. Carrillo-Hawkins is adamant that the benefits far outweigh the problems. “I just really love having that conversation with the client,” she says. “The flowers I’m harvesting from my field will last so much longer than imported flowers, as they haven’t been sprayed. I think the environmental aspect of purchasing from a local farm far exceeds the click-and-collect demand of imported flowers that you can get from wholesalers.” She also points out that the “garden-gathered” trend means that local suppliers may have an advantage, as they can provide unusual flowers that might not travel well via cargo or freight. “It’s just so beautiful to see those flowers gracing tables, like bearded irises. A lot of those conversations are about memories that people have, of their grandparents having a bungalow with irises, and the different colours. I just really like that avenue, to get people to connect through flowers, to the environment, by having these conversations with complete strangers.” Many of the growers I spoke to sell locally and get to know their customers. “For a lot of people, it’s about connecting with their community,” explains Michelle Owen. Prior to the pandemic, she was an interior decorator and wallpaper designer, but in lockdown, she and her family moved from inner city Bristol to Bridport in Dorset, gaining a much bigger garden in the process. “Last summer I started growing dahlias, zinnias, all seasonal stuff, and I ended up giving away so many bunches to people, friends and neighbours. And they all loved them, and said, ‘I wish we could get flowers like this in the shops.’” She subsequently set up Flower Coast Garden, and is in her first season of growing; she will offer local subscriptions and sell within the area, using paper to wrap bunches, rather than plastic. “You know, when you get a beautiful bunch of flowers from the garden, they smell amazing,” she says. “The ones in the supermarket just don’t smell the same.” Often, though not always, buying flowers from a local grower will be more expensive than a bunch of daffodils from the supermarket. This turns flowers into a treat, a luxury, and right now, for many, those indulgences may be few and far between. At her farm in Worcestershire, Edmonds urges me to smell the flowers. They have a different, much more vibrant aroma to anything you could find at the supermarket. A lily-flowered tulip smells like oranges. “Isn’t it gorgeous?” she says. Before I leave, I buy a bunch of huge red tulips from the farm shop, 10 stems for £15, for a friend’s birthday that weekend. I had seen where they came from, and the love and work that went into growing them. Each one was as big as the palm of my hand. Several days later, my friend sent me a picture. They were still going strong, and they were gorgeous.",News/Environment,Bursting into flower: the growth of sustainable blooms,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/15/bursting-into-flower-a-new-generation-of-growers-sell-blooms-straight-from-the-field
5/15/2022,"Although Dance Fever was made through successive lockdowns, it isn’t another pandemic disco record, exactly. Choreomania – a track that comes early in Florence Welch’s fifth album – is named for a medieval epidemic of involuntary movement, a “dance fever” understood then as a form of possession, and now as more of a mass stress response. So while Welch channels Into the Groove-era-Madonna on Free – “when I’m dancing, I’m free” – the emphasis on these very grownup, self-aware songs is on exorcising, rather than exercising. Welch’s last album, High As Hope (2018), was candid in its treatment of this artist’s internal turmoil, but Dance Fever has you crawling around, a fly on the wall in her therapist’s office. Like Adele’s 30, Dance Fever has a lot to say about being female, about self-sabotage and compromise; it strums the pain of her listenership with its fingers, grappling with a muse that is sometimes more albatross than ally. With production started by super-producer Jack Antonoff but finished by Dave Bayley, the album takes a step back from the vast productions of Welch’s most famous work, with nods to the Rolling Stones (Dream Girl Evil) and plenty of unexpected chiaroscuro, the better to foreground her luxuriant voice.",Arts/Music,Florence and the Machine: Dance Fever review – a fly on the wall in her therapist’s office,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/15/florence-the-machine-dance-fever-review-florence-welch-exorcises-her-demons
5/15/2022,"Sir Keir Starmer has had mixed reviews since he became Labour’s leading man. Decent and diligent, but dull. Serious and competent, but colourless and uncharismatic. Better at running a meeting than inspiring the crowd. Effective at the dispatch box, but struggling to articulate a defining vision to the country or to make a fizzing connection with the electorate. For better and for worse, it has largely been a case of no-drama Starmer over the past two years. Nobody thought of this unflashy, cautious and fastidious man as a huge gambler. The last venue anyone expected to find Sir Keir was in the casino hurling dice at the craps table. Yet he has placed a bet with vertiginously high stakes by pledging to “do the right thing and step down” if found guilty of breaching lockdown rules. If he ends up quitting, historians will scratch their heads over how it came to pass that a law-breaking prime minister could cling to office despite numerous and flagrant instances of lockdown-busting at Number 10, while the leader of the opposition impaled himself on his honour over just one event. Some will dispute my suggestion that he has taken a gamble. Sir Keir insists that he made his televised pledge confident that the police will not find against him because he broke no rules when he had a beer and a takeaway curry with aides and local activists after a day of campaigning in the north of England in April last year. His team say they have the proof necessary to convince the Durham constabulary that he was taking a meal break while at work, an allowable exception to the ban on “indoor socialising” which applied at the time. Yet he can’t be 100% certain that the police will endorse his belief that this was lawful. No one can be totally sure. Some of his allies aren’t. One lawyer friend of the Labour leader says: “He did absolutely nothing wrong. He will be OK, I think, but obviously there is a risk that the police will take a different view.” A significant element of the risk is that the police have not been models of consistency in handling allegations of lockdown-busting by politicians and their staff. The Metropolitan force was initially reluctant to investigate the partying in Downing Street until the scale of the public uproar forced it to act. Durham police had earlier declared that Sir Keir had no case to answer, only then to change its minds on the grounds that new evidence had come to light. So there is definite risk in placing his fate in the hands of the detectives. Others say this can’t be properly called “a gamble” because the Labour leader only made his pledge when he had run out of other options. It is true that he and his team badly fumbled responses to a ferocious campaign waged by the Tories and their media allies to push the police into opening an investigation. His office came up with inconsistent accounts of the event and he gave interviews that were woodenly defensive. At the traditional reception hosted by the Speaker on the day of the Queen’s speech, one former Tory cabinet minister came up to Sir Keir and said to him: “You may have been the best prosecutor of your generation, but you are the world’s worst defence witness.” The Labour leader responded “thanks very much” before breaking into a rueful smile. He has built his personal brand and sought to strike a flattering contrast with his Tory rival by presenting himself to the public as “Mr Rules”, the champion of integrity in public life. He has repeatedly called for Boris Johnson to resign. Tories have been braying that the Labour leader is a “hypocrite”. These were clearly factors when he made his decision, but the suggestion that he had no choice gives Sir Keir less credit than he deserves. Many others in his position would have swerved making such a unequivocal pledge. The typical political operator would have looked for a way to slither through and hunker down until the storm passed. I’ve heard plenty of MPs, both Labour and Conservative, privately describe him as crazy for gambling his career on this. The Tories were not demanding his resignation. They were in no position to call for his head when the number of penalty notices imposed on the denizens of Downing Street now exceeds 100, with one fine slapped on the prime minister already and potentially more coming his way. There was no great pressure on Sir Keir from within his own party. The only voices suggesting that he might have to go belonged to dispossessed Corbynites such as Diane Abbott. One senior Labour figure reports: “A lot of people on our side are saying he’s been very foolish, he shouldn’t have made this promise. A more hardened politician would have avoided it.” He could have held to the line that there is no equivalence between a bottle of beer and a takeaway in a constituency office and what went on at the heart of government during some of the deadliest stretches of the pandemic. His alleged single infraction is very much less serious than proved and serial partying at Number 10, among them a “bring-your-own-booze” bash, “wine Fridays”, Christmas revelries and a raucous night-time leaving do that involved a karaoke machine and a suitcase of alcohol being lugged into the building. One of the most galling things for Labour MPs is that so-called beergate is very small beer compared with partygate. Nor is Sir Keir charged, as the prime minister very much is, with deliberately lying to parliament about transgressing the rules. So there was a low road he could have sneaked down and many other politicians in his circumstances would have gone that way. I find it admirable that he instead chose to take the high but more hazardous road. If the result is career-ending, he will at least be able to say that he leaves Labour in a much better state than he found it. The last general election was such a catastrophe for the party that its parliamentary representation was crushed down to its lowest level since 1935. Tories confidently bragged – and Labour people fatalistically groaned – that the Conservatives had been guaranteed another decade in power. There’s much less of that kind of talk these days. The opinion polls and the results of the recent local elections do not arouse boundless confidence that Labour is on a sure trajectory to winning the next election. But the party’s position today is a considerable advance on where it stood two years ago. One of the big improvements on Sir Keir’s watch has been to the calibre of Labour’s front bench line-up. He has reharnessed established talents in his party who went into internal exile during the Corbyn years, such as Yvette Cooper and Rachel Reeves. By giving a high-profile role to Lisa Nandy, he has not overlooked the abilities of someone who competed against him for the leadership. He has also brought on rising stars such as Wes Streeting. All of the above are among the potential contenders to succeed him if it comes to that. His team-building is a highly attractive contrast with his Tory rival, a man solely animated by his own selfish interests, who protects his position by surrounding himself with slavish mediocrities. If the police investigation exonerates Sir Keir, the interesting question is whether his gamble will deliver any reward. It will not shame Mr Johnson into quitting because nothing will. Shame is not a component of this prime minister’s DNA. It will draw an even more compelling contrast between the two men. Labour MPs returned from campaigning in the local elections worried about the many encounters with voters who rejected their solicitations by saying “you’re all the same” or “you’re all as bad as each other”. A dismal view of the political class as a whole absolutely suits the Tory leader. Since a hefty majority of voters think that Mr Johnson is a mendacious scoundrel, he is best served if they have an equally low opinion of the competition. Sir Keir hopes to change that by acting so very differently to his Tory counterpart and demonstrating that not all politicians have the bottom-dwelling standards of the incumbent. Doing the right thing matters. Integrity in public life matters. Do they matter enough to sufficient voters to make a critical difference when they next choose a prime minister? If they don’t, the Labour leader will have risked his career without achieving anything for his cause. Expecting his pledge to gain him credit with a country made cynical about its politicians is Sir Keir’s greatest gamble of all.

So when I find myself getting ready in the morning, my darker, woodsy perfume that gave me the illusion of warmth during the winter months, is no longer sitting well with the change of season. So it’s finally time to switch to a summer scent, because we update our wardrobe seasonally, why not our fragrance, too? You can go with a classic floral or zesty citrus, which are sure-fire ways to make you feel as if you’re skipping through the countryside when you close your eyes on that packed train. Alternatively, escape to warm summer nights with vanilla and ylang-ylang notes that will have you dreaming of your next holiday. Switching up your fragrances, though not mandatory, is a subtle way of effectively revitalising your look and feel.
