4/24/2022,"Fox News host Neil Cavuto just could not make his viewers happy Saturday, with many either questioning why he was coming down so hard on Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody over a new state law dissolving Walt Disney World’s self-governing status, or questioning why he wasn’t coming down hard enough in an interview with Dr. Anthony Fauci. Speaking with Moody, Cavuto asked what she thought the fallout will be from this, because some fear it’s going to mean higher taxes, “particular in the counties affected that include the Magic Kingdom.” Moody responded the special district was set up “because they thought it was in the best interest of the state to do that and had not been reviewed or reevaluated.” She went on to say the situation has changed, where Florida lawmakers were acting on parents’ right as to what their children were taught in school. “And you had this company come out that had been given so much autonomy and control within the state, come out and specifically in a very fraudulent, false way start this smear campaign against lawyers,” she said. Cavuto pushed back with: “I understand all your concerns on how this law was misinterpreted. I get that. But that this is going after them with a sledgehammer here, and under 50-plus years of Republican and Democrat governors, no one is threatened or taken action like this. They were all fine with this special exemption that Disney enjoyed because it benefited Disney benefited Florida… do you think you are going too far?” Cavuto’s provocative question came in reaction to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signing a bill on Friday that would eliminate Disney World’s private government, a move thought to have been provoked by Disney’s opposition of a new state law dubbed “Don’t Say Gay.” Disney has vowed to work toward repealing the controversial law that prohibits classroom instruction of sexual orientation and gender identity for some younger age groups in the state. The newly approved bill would eliminate Disney’s Reedy Creek Improvement District, as the government is known, as well as other similar districts by June 2023. The measure allows for the districts to be reestablished, leaving an avenue to renegotiate its future. The law would have significant tax implications for Disney. Here are just a handful of the many reactions that came in swiftly about their interaction: I see it as… If you're not going to answer my question, I'm going to try again. Cavuto is trying to get her to realize that companies are watching & will consider this before moving to a state where a business can't voice an opinion w/o revenge. — BZ (@30stmFantasy) April 23, 2022 Thanks for shutting her down, I appreciate your fair and balanced approach. We all know her opinion, we pretty much know everyone’s opinion, news should be the news. Thanks Neil — realSeanWagner (@realSeanWagner1) April 23, 2022 I have mixed feelings on this. State run schools I agree with DeSantis with indoctrination in elementary schools. Private companies not sure. As a conservative I see an authoritarian trend in the GOP. Disturbs me. — strongsaftyy (@david_michalak) April 23, 2022 They knew and DeSantis even expanded their privileges last year.. they can spin it any way they want to but its revenge pity politics and its against the very principles GOP say they are for.. this should frighten every Corp in Fl and everyone that supports LGBTQ and minorities. — Shea (@nichpic) April 23, 2022 Cavuto also is taking a social media bashing over his Saturday interview with National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci about New York mayor Eric Adams lifting vaccine mandates for professional athletes and entertainers. Twitter user Bruce Neely sneered at what he called Cavuto’s “codling” (sic) interview on the subject. In the interview, Cavuto said that Adams was getting a “collective Bronx cheer” from New Yorkers and pushed Fauci to offer an opinion on the vaccine exemption being for athletes and entertainers only: “Why couldn’t it be for everybody,” but Fauci remained evasive, calling it a “delicate situation” and saying he did not want to comment on the local decision. Cavuto codling that loser Fauci on his show. Once again snap, off goes Fox News — Bruce Neely (@BruceNeely5) April 23, 2022 Dave Bower responded: Gave up on Cavuto a long time ago. I did respect him a few years ago, but no more. — Dave Bower (@BowerDA222) April 23, 2022 One Twitter user who has posted numerous anti-vax tweets offered this comment in response to Fox News’ own tweets touting the interview: “Telling that that massive putz will go on with Cavuto.” Some commenters can’t decide who they hate most, Cavuto or Fauci: Watching a jackass Fauci word salad on Fox with Neil Cavuto, trying to defend masks. Nobody elected you Fauci so sit down and shut the hell up. @GOP @JudiciaryGOP @HouseGOP @Jim_Jordan @SenRonJohnson @TeamCavuto — Brad (@Brad41219011) April 23, 2022 Cavuto, who has said his life was saved by the COVID-19 vaccine, has been criticized in the past for going soft on Fauci on the air. Fauci is regularly sneered at by lawmakers and media figures on the right. Cavuto’s colleague, primetime host Tucker Carlson, has called him “Jesus for people who don’t believe in God.”",U.S./The Wrap,Fox News’ Neil Cavuto Bashed for Telling Florida AG New Disney Law ‘Is Going After Them With a Sledgehammer’,https://news.yahoo.com/fox-news-neil-cavuto-bashed-224618598.html
4/24/2022,"TOKYO (AP) — The Japanese Coast Guard said Sunday that their and police helicopters found four of the 26 people on a tour boat missing in the frigid waters of northern Japan since the day before. The four people were found near the tip of Shiretoko Peninsula. But the coast guard said it could not confirm whether they were rescued alive. The boat carrying 24 passengers and two crew members had gone missing after sending a distress call Saturday, saying it took in water and was beginning to sink. Sunday’s rescue comes after nearly 19 hours of intense search involving six patrol boats, several aircraft and divers. The coast guard said the search continued through the night. The 19-ton Kazu 1 made an emergency call in early afternoon, saying the ship’s bow had flooded and it was beginning to sink and tilt while traveling off the western coast of Shiretoko Peninsula in the northern island of Hokkaido, the coast guard said. The tour boat has since lost contact, according to the coast guard. It said the boat was carrying 24 passengers, including two children, and two crew. Average April sea temperatures in Shiretoko National Park are just above freezing. An official of the vessel’s operator, Shiretoko Pleasure Cruise, said he could not comment as he had to respond to calls from worried families of the passengers. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who was attending a two-day water summit in Kumamoto in southern Japan, had canceled his program for the second day and returned to Tokyo. He told reporters in the early hours of Sunday that he instructed officials “to do everything they can for the rescue.” High waves and strong winds were observed in the area around noon, according to a local fisheries cooperative. Japanese media reports said fishing boats had returned to port before noon because of the bad weather. NHK said there was a warning for high waves of up to 3 meters (9 feet) high. Yoshihiko Yamada, a Tokai University marine science professor, said the boat was likely to have run aground after it was tossed around in high waves and damaged, flooded and probably sank. A tour boat of that size usually does not carry a life boat, and passengers possibly could not jump out of a rapidly sinking vessel with its windows probably closed to shield them from strong winds. In an interview with the TBS television, Yamada said there is also a slight possibility that the boat might have been hit by a whale. The cold temperature and strong wind could cause hypothermia and put the passengers in severe conditions for survival, according to Jun Abe, vice chairman of the Society of Water Rescue and Survival Research. “It’s a very severe condition especially when they are wet,” Abe told TBS. According to the operator’s website, the tour takes about three hours and offers a scenic view of the western coast of the peninsula, including the nature scene and animals such as whales, dolphins and the brown bear. The national park is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site and is famous as the southernmost region to see drifting sea ice.",World/Associated Press,4 people from missing tour boat in Japan found,https://news.yahoo.com/4-people-missing-tour-boat-225108580.html
