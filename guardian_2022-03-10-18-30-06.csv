3/10/2022,"The Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden’s pay rose by a quarter in 2021 to £6m, as the fossil fuel producer benefited from soaring energy prices amid calls for a windfall tax on energy companies. The FTSE 100 company reported record profits during 2021, thanks in part to a gas price surge in the final three months of the year amid a rebound in demand for commodities as the global economy recovered from coronavirus pandemic lockdowns. Van Beurden’s pay rise, to €7.4m (£6.1m) in 2021 from €5.8m (£4.9m) the year before, came amid widespread calls, including from the Labour party, for booming energy companies to pay a windfall tax on profits as people in Britain and beyond struggle with a cost-of-living crisis. Average weekly earnings for British people rose by 4.3% in the year to December, meaning their real wages fell because of inflation, caused in part by higher energy prices. Van Beurden was paid 57 times more than the median Shell worker in 2021, according to the company’s annual report. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused energy prices to rise further since the start of the year, suggesting that even higher bills may be likely for households and businesses. Van Beurden was forced to withdraw Shell from its Russian fossil fuel business, including drilling projects at the Sakhalin-II liquefied natural gas facility, projects in Salym and Gydan, both in western Siberia, and its involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which has been cancelled since the invasion. Shell also said it would stop buying Russian oil or gas, and would close its 500 petrol stations in the country. Van Beurden said last week: “Our decision to exit is one we take with conviction.” However, in his foreword to the annual report he described the exit as “in line with government guidance”, referring to the heavy pressure thought to be exerted by the UK government as it sought to isolate Russia’s economy. Shell acknowledged the exits could cost it billions of pounds. The company awarded Van Beurden €5.4m in bonuses and long-term incentive payments, on top of his €2m fixed pay. He also received a “motoring allowance” of €14,400 and money to pay for transport between his home and the office of €2,494. He will also be paid moving costs and a housing allowance for two years after relocating from the Netherlands to London at the company’s request. Shell paused Van Beurden’s annual bonus during the first year of the pandemic. Before that he received €10m in 2019 and €20m in 2018, a record if excluding 2014 when pension calculations inflated his reported salary.",News/Business,Shell chief’s pay rose by a quarter in 2021 to £6m,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/10/shell-chief-pay-ben-van-beurden-oil
3/10/2022,"Tomb of Sand by Indian writer Geetanjali Shree has become the first book translated from Hindi to be nominated for the International Booker prize. The judges praised the “loud and irresistible” tale of an elderly woman who gains a new lease of life after her husband’s death. The 64-year-old author’s fifth novel is among 13 titles in competition for the prestigious award for translated fiction, a £50,000 prize split evenly between author and translator. This year, the shortlisted authors and translators will also each receive £2,500, rather than the £1,000 they were given previously. The 2022 longlist includes books from 12 countries and translated from 11 languages. Shree and her translator Daisy Rockwell are up against previous winner and Nobel laureate Olga Tokarczuk, whose epic novel The Books of Jacob has been called her “magnum opus”, and took Jennifer Croft seven years to translate. Marcel Theroux said in his Guardian review that this 900-page chronicle of an 18th-century Polish Jew who claimed to be the messiah “will be a landmark in the life of any reader with the appetite to tackle it”. Previous winners David Grossman and his translator Jessica Cohen have also made this year’s longlist for More Than I Love My Life, a multigenerational family novel described as “scrupulous” and “anguished” by Guardian reviewer Alex Clark. Cursed Bunny by Bora Chung, translated by Anton Hur (Honford Star) After The Sun by Jonas Eika, translated by Sherilyn NicoletteHellberg (Lolli) A New Name:Septology VI-VII by Jon Fosse, translated by Damion Searls (Fitzcarraldo)  More Than I LoveMy Life by DavidGrossman, translated by Jessica Cohen (Jonathan Cape) The Book ofMother by ViolaineHuisman, translated by Leslie Camhi (Virago) Heaven by MiekoKawakami, translated by Samuel Bett andDavid Boyd (Picador)   Paradais by FernandaMelchor, translated by Sophie Hughes (Fitzcarraldo) Love in the BigCity by Sang YoungPark, translated by Anton Hur (Tilted Axis)  Happy Stories,Mostly by Norman EriksonPasaribu, translated by Tiffany Tsao (Tilted Axis)  Elena Knows by Claudia Piñeiro, translated by Frances Riddle (Charco)  Phenotypes by Paulo Scott, translated by Daniel Hahn (And OtherStories) Tomb of Sand by GeetanjaliShree, translated by Daisy Rockwell (Tilted Axis) The Books of Jacob by Olga Tokarczuk, translated by Jennifer Croft (Fitzcarraldo) Two more titles from Shree’s publishing house Tilted Axis have been selected: Happy Stories, Mostly by Norman Erikson Pasaribu and translator Tiffany Tsao, and Love in the Big City by Sang Young Park and translator Anton Hur. The small not-for-profit press mostly publishes Asian writers and was founded in 2015 by Deborah Smith, who translated the Man Booker International prize-winning The Vegetarian by Han Kang. The 2022 longlist, which as usual is dominated by titles from independent presses, is the first time Tilted Axis has had books selected by the prize. The angst of teenage years is a common theme on the longlist: Tomb of Sand’s protagonist, Ma, looks back at her troubled adolescence, while Fernanda Melchor’s Paradais centres on two misfit teenage boys who plan a terrible crime and Heaven by Mieko Kawakami is narrated by a bullied 14-year-old. Family relations are also explored, from Grossman’s More Than I Love My Life, in which a strong-willed daughter returns to her family, to Violaine Huisman’s tale of a daughter’s love for her volatile “Maman”, The Book of Mother. Chair of judges Frank Wynne said that “spending the past year in the company of some of the world’s great writers and their equally gifted translators has been a kind of heaven. From the intimate to the epic, the numinous to the profane, the books make up a passionately debated longlist that traces a ring around the world.” He believes that the chosen books “explore the breadth and depth of human experience, and are a testament to the power of language and literature”. Wynne, who is the first translator to head the prize’s judging panel, selected the longlist with four fellow judges: author and academic Merve Emre; writer and lawyer Petina Gappah; writer and comedian Viv Groskop and translator and author Jeremy Tiang. The International Booker was founded in 2005 in order to complement the Booker prize for English-language fiction. Last year’s winner was At Night All Blood Is Black by French novelist David Diop, translated by Anna Moschovakis. The six-book shortlist will be announced on 7 April, and the winner on 26 May.",Arts/Books,International Booker prize announces longlist ‘tracing ring around the world’,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/10/international-booker-prize-announces-longlist-tracing-ring-around-the-world
3/10/2022,"About 140 years before its designation as a national park, William Wordsworth described the Lake District as “a sort of national property in which every man has a right and an interest”. Like other English national parks, however, this one is mostly in private hands. It also lacks the wilderness associated with designated landscapes elsewhere. But it is firmly a public asset: loved by millions, and subject to the demands of landowners, tenants, taxpayers and visitors from around the world. For generations these demands have centred on agricultural heritage and aesthetics, but increasingly prominent on the list of “what the Lake District ought to do for us” are ecosystem services such as carbon storage, water management and biodiversity. Lee Schofield is a country boy who grew into an ecologist and conservationist, and as such he embodies the “messy middle” in the old and wearisome war between town and country. He’s an easy person to like – thoughtful, quietly spoken, a watcher and listener, a writer and singer of folky songs. But he’s found himself in a place and a job in which perhaps his most important characteristic is resilience. The place is Haweswater in the north-eastern edge of the Lake District national park, and the job is overseeing the ecological restoration of a landscape on behalf of the RSPB, who rent the land from United Utilities. The site includes Haweswater reservoir and two traditional hill farms. To the ecologist’s eye, centuries of sheep grazing on these fells have created a denuded landscape. To Schofield, it is a landscape of ghosts: those of pine martens, corncrakes and black grouse, and golden eagles (the last in England, a lone male, lived here until 2015), and everywhere the shadows of lost woodlands and absent alpine flowers. Of these, a few species cling on by the narrowest of margins, national rarities, relegated to remote crags inaccessible to grazing animals, in particular sheep. His job is not only to restore biodiversity and abundance, and the ability of the land to hold water and carbon, but to prove that it can be done alongside traditional farming. Reducing the number of sheep is hugely controversial, not least because of the practical implications for neighbouring farms. The high ground where sheep spend the summer is common land and stock are hefted, which is to say they learn to stick to their patch without being fenced in. A lighter grazing regime creates grass that is literally greener, not to mention studded with diverse and delicious herbs: an irresistible temptation to animals on adjacent hefts. Other objections are deeply cultural. Hill farming heritage is imprinted on lives as well as landscape here, and in pursuit of the recent Unesco world heritage site designation of the Lake District, proponents have committed to the preservation of cultural heritage even where it is at odds with climate and biodiversity considerations. As a measure of the mismatch, consider that the presence of the RSPB at Haweswater was described by a member of the world heritage site steering group as a wart on the face of the bid. It’s a relief to leave the contested fells for a bit, to glimpse other ways of farming hills. In sojourns to Norway and the Italian Alps, Schofield describes highly traditional farms operating in biodiverse landscapes – energising intimations of what might be. No one person and no one organisation can bring about the necessary change, but Schofield is doing more than most, and the vision he paints, of a fecund, collaborative, ecologically and economically sustainable future, is worth swallowing some pride for on both sides. The ranks of farmers willing to embrace or at least consider change swell year on year, and Lee is supported by a thriving local conservation community. The results speak for themselves. In summer, the hay meadows of this part of the park are a flickering, bobbing sea of flowers and butterflies, and the once canalised Swindale Beck now jinks around its old meandering course, glinting over clean gravels where salmon are spawning again. Schofield is a delightfully companionable guide – evoking huge vistas alongside small, exquisite, multisensory details – you can almost inhale the scent of thyme and warm rock wafting from the pages.

3/10/2022,"Oil and gas companies and lobby groups in Canada are heavily investing in campaigns to present themselves as defenders of Indigenous interests in the face of high-profile protests against a controversial natural gas pipeline on First Nation land, a new investigation by Eco-Bot.Net and the Guardian has found. “I’m being a steward to my land and I’m being a defender,” read one of 21 ads targeting British Columbia in November 2021, quoting a Coastal GasLink worker from Nak’azdli Whut’en’ First Nation. As the ad conveying Indigenous support for the pipeline appeared on the Facebook and Instagram feeds of people in the Canadian province, 30 Wet’suwet’en Nation members and supporters were being violently evicted from their territory along the pipeline. Police breached two cabins with an axe, chainsaw, dog unit and snipers aimed at the door. “The thing I remember most is the dogs … barking and whining, pulling their leashes trying to get at you,” recounts Sleydo’ Molly Wickham, a member of the Gidimt’en Clan of the Wet’suwet’en, who was arrested. A recording the police put out over their radios also left a strong imprint on her memory. “They were playing a horror film audio. You know, where the little child sings ‘I know where you are, I’m gonna get you, I’m coming for you.’” The fossil fuel groups spent some C$122,000 (US$95,249) on more than 400 targeted Facebook and Instagram ads over the past two years relating to various oil and gas projects throughout the country. The ads spiked last November during Indigenous land defense actions on the Coastal GasLink pipeline in British Columbia and solidarity protests across Canada. The vast majority of the ads, which were shown some 21m times in total, were linked to the Coastal GasLink pipeline, the site of intense protest and violent police crackdown in recent years. Coastal GasLink is one of three multibillion-dollar pipelines facing opposition by some Indigenous and environmental groups in Canada. The construction of the 670km pipeline through unceded Wet’suwet’en territory – land never signed away to the Canadian government – has sparked nationwide protests in recent years. The pipeline has also exacerbated complex divisions within the Wet’suwet’en First Nation, some of whom favor the economic opportunities promised by the project. Analysis of Facebook advertisements from January 2020 to the present by Eco-Bot.Net, a research project exposing climate crisis misinformation and corporate greenwashing online, has found a steady flow of “Indigenous-washing” ad campaigns from TC Energy, the company behind the pipeline, and associated oil and gas lobby groups. TC Energy accounts for almost three-quarters of the ad spend and impressions investigated. As recently as mid-February, the company ran two such ads – both of which were removed by Facebook for running without a disclaimer that includes information on who paid for the advert. In October last year, solidarity protests were held in British Columbia and other parts of the country after a Wet’suwet’en hereditary chief was arrested for blocking pipeline construction. Over the subsequent five week period, TC Energy and affiliated groups launched dozens of ads which were shown 1.7m times across Canada. Together they paid C$14,000 to Meta, Facebook and Instagram’s parent company. Advertising rose in the days after the chief’s arrest, and then spiked during the enforcement of a court injunction to remove land defenders. About half of these ads were targeted at British Columbia, with some ads reaching viewers from within a small “estimated audience size”, indicating that ads used Meta’s interest-based micro-targeting tools. It is not possible to determine the precise audiences targeted, but one Indigenous activist interviewed reported being regularly bombarded with the ads. “The upticks in industry spending on ads directed at specific demographics and coinciding with protests appear to be classic examples of financially motivated, politically oriented, micro-targeted public affairs campaigns,” said Harvard University climate disinformation researcher Geoffrey Supran. “There are no better predictors of fossil fuel industry ad spending than political action and media attention, and this data appears to be a case in point.” Launched during the Cop26 climate talks and founded by artist and disinformation researcher Bill Posters and Massive Attack’s Rob Del Naja, Eco-Bot.Net scrapes databases of social media advertising paid for by some of the world’s most polluting companies. Eco-Bot.Net defines corporate greenwashing as a tactic used to mislead consumers about the green credentials of a product or service, or about the environmental performance of a company. Some researchers use the term Indigenous-washing to refer to the tactic by high-polluting companies to mislead the public about their relationship to Indigenous peoples and their land. Working with Meta’s Ad Library, the investigation used keyword searches such as “Indigenous” or “First Nations” in conjunction with “pipeline” or “oil”, to identify Indigenous-washing actors in Canada. Journalists and disinformation researchers, including the two authors of this article, then analyzed all of the ads run by the accounts of these groups in 2020 and 2021. Using terminology such as land “defender”, “eco-colonialism” and “reconciliation”, the ads employ buzzwords and phrases used in Indigenous rights discourse to portray the oil and gas companies as aligned with Indigenous groups.“The very fact that they’re pushing [these ads] is like a drowning man getting caught in a swift river. A piece of straw goes by and he wants to grab it, hoping it’ll save him,” said the Wet’suwet’en hereditary chief Na’Moks, who opposes the pipeline. Last year, Joe Biden revoked a permit for the cross-border Keystone XL pipeline, which is also owned by TC Energy. Indigenous groups and environmentalists had opposed the pipeline for more than decade. TC Energy is seeking $15bn in damages from the US government. Another spike in the ads found by Eco-Bot.Net went on for almost three months at the start of 2020. The ads were placed amidst nationwide backlash to an injunction barring land defenders from blocking Coastal GasLink construction. TC Energy and associated lobby groups spent some C$52,000 during this period, resulting in 12m social media impressions in Canada. The ads initially targeted British Columbia but shifted to other parts of the country where solidarity protests were strong, such as Ontario. The end of this spike coincided with declarations of a “state of emergency” across Canada’s provinces, which put a stop to large gatherings in order to mitigate the spread of Covid. Lobby groups paying for the ads include the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), which count Coastal GasLink pipeline partners Shell, Petronas Energy and PetroChina as members. Another involved lobby group, the Canadian Energy Centre, is financed by the Government of Alberta’s Technology, Innovation and Emissions Reduction fund, which oil and gas companies, including TC Energy, pay into. Earlier this month, land defenders filed a submission to the UN Human Rights Council detailing police raids in recent years, which have resulted in the arrests of 74 people. The Guardian revealed that in one of those raids, officers were prepared to use lethal force against land defenders. The UN submission argues that Canada is violating several articles under the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. But the social media adverts tell a different story. “Meet Shirley & Alma, Wet’suwet’en members who see the opportunities Coastal GasLink is bringing to their community,” reads one advert. Another says that land defenders are “disrupting potentially game changing opportunities for Indigenous communities”. The strategy of elevating the views of Indigenous people who are in favour of the pipeline “pits folks against each other in our communities, driving that divide and conquer tactic that we’ve encountered every step of the way since colonisation,” said Karla Tait, a member of the Gilseyhu Clan of the Wet’suwet’en. Hereditary chiefs mostly oppose the pipeline, believing that treating natural resources as commodities is fundamentally at odds with Wet’suwet’en responsibilities to the land. But band chiefs and councils – who are democratically elected as part of an administrative structure imposed during colonisation – are generally in favour, saying the pipeline will help lift the Wet’suwet’en Nation from poverty. Throughout the project, TC Energy has negotiated with the Wet’suwet’en bands for access to the land rather than hereditary chiefs. Facebook adverts suggest broad support from the Wet’suwet’en by only promoting the company’s agreements with the bands. The pipeline, however, cuts across unceded Wet’suwet’en territory and so remains under the jurisdiction of hereditary chiefs, according to a 1997 supreme court ruling, although the judgment allows for “the infringement of aboriginal title”. In response to a request for comment, TC Energy and CAPP reiterated their support from the band councils, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said it had no choice but to enforce the injunction. The Government of British Columbia, the Canadian Energy Centre and the Wet’suwet’en band chiefs and councils contacted by the Guardian did not provide comment. In the ads, oil and gas development is portrayed as necessary for Indigenous economic development and poverty alleviation. “A strong oil and gas sector is key for Indigenous education and prosperity,” reads one ad, alongside an image of a Siksika First Nation woman standing next to a tipi. Ads like this “appear to reduce local Indigenous communities to a homogeneous, single-minded population, which presumably misrepresents the cultural and political diversities and complexities of this situation”, said Supran. “We live in communities where there’s very few economic opportunities, and jobs are few and far between. So I don’t begrudge anyone that takes a job with the pipelines,” said Tait, who was arrested during the February 2020 raids along with her mother and aunt. Natural gas projects receive billions of dollars’ worth of subsidies from the British Columbia government, which says it views the pipeline as “a pathway to prosperity” for First Nations. According to the YellowHead Institute, a First Nation-led research centre, this makes government support for First Nations “contingent upon support for pipeline deals”. Leaders like Chief Na’Moks do not see the pipeline build as a viable route to prosperity. “We as hereditary chiefs have to think thousands of years in the future,” he said. “We protect our lands. That’s what we’re doing right now, peacefully. Yet they come at us with guns.”",News/Environment,Canadian pipeline groups spend big to pose as Indigenous champions,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/10/canadian-pipeline-groups-spend-big-to-pose-as-indigenous-champions
3/10/2022,"In much of the soccer world, the US women’s team and players such as Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan are beloved superstars and powerful voices for equal rights. Many in the rank-and-file of US Soccer don’t share that sentiment though. In their eyes, the US national teams – particularly the women – are bleeding the federation dry while leaving precious little for grassroots associations charged with overcoming the sport’s stagnation and decline among young players. That’s one of the takeaways from last week’s US Soccer presidential election, in which incumbent Cindy Cone barely held onto her position – by a margin of 52.9% to 47.1% in the weighted-vote tally – after a strong insurgent campaign by Carlos Cordeiro, who had resigned just two years ago and handed the reins to then vice-president Cone. Cone’s bloc of elite athletes and pro leagues barely held on to power against the state youth and adult associations along with a few other voting entities such as US Youth Soccer. On the surface, supporting Cordeiro made little sense. His bungling ended when he took the fall for an insulting (and, given the rest of the case, wholly unnecessary) legal brief in the lawsuit brought by the US women’s team. It wasn’t his only misstep. He was clumsy in the spotlight, with comments more cringeworthy than anything Ricky Gervais could conjure. He dithered over the hiring of a new CEO who might have flagged that offensive brief or improved a work environment described as toxic. Recent revelations have shown the federation failed to react to reports of systemic abuse of women’s players from youth level to the pros. Cordeiro touted his ability to navigate the world of high finance, but there were hints of a sponsor revolt had he won. Cone therefore inherited a mess, just as Covid appeared and made her job even tougher. She also had to deal with a federal mandate that gave national team players more power within the federation – a decision out of her hands but nevertheless resented by the grassroots types. On the surface, Cone did well. The budget was stabilized, she settled a pointless legal fight with the US Soccer Foundation that had been brought on by Cordeiro’s arrogance, landed a new broadcast deal with Turner Sports, and brokered a tentative settlement in the high-profile women’s team lawsuit that has cost the federation a lot of money and goodwill. Unsurprisingly, many women’s team players either formally or informally endorsed Cone, a Hall of Famer who played for the team two decades ago. “The US Soccer Federation needs a leader who will move our sport forward, not backward,” read a letter from 18 players. The letter didn’t mention Cordeiro. It didn’t have to. Most fans of the women’s team surely shared the players’ opinion. A straw poll by supporters’ organization the American Outlaws ran 91% in favor of Cone. “If Carlos Cordeiro is elected we riot,” read a tweet from The Women’s Soccer Show. That was a risk the grassroots organizations were willing to take. Officially, their biggest complaint was that the people working at ground level felt neglected. Cone and her staff have been seen as aloof, focusing more on the national teams than on the members who play a vital role in growing the game. “Our current US Soccer culture has created a division between the ‘Elites’ and the ‘Grassroots,’” US Youth Soccer chair Dr Pete Zopfi, who produced an election-eve endorsement for Cordeiro, wrote in an email to the Guardian. “Hopefully what we heard and saw before the election about ‘working with all members’ was not just political rhetoric.” If the problem was simply time and attention, that might not be so bad. But the biggest complaints were about money. State associations raised pointed questions about paltry spending on grassroots needs such as referee programs in comparison to the big numbers – the men’s national team is budgeted at a loss of $13.6m, with the women set to lose nearly $10.8m. To an extent, the federation can point to sponsorship revenue that’s listed separately and is surely driven primarily by the national teams. But the budget shows an overall loss of $30.67m. That will prompt some resentment toward both national teams. But the women were particularly outspoken against Cordeiro, and the states have been particularly disdainful of the USWNT. And the settlement of the women’s lawsuit, seen in some quarters as a piece of news conveniently timed to help Cone win reelection, may have had the opposite effect, furthering resentment toward the team. Assuming a new collective bargaining agreement can be reached, which isn’t a sure thing, the women’s lawsuit will be settled for a fee of $24m. In the states’ eyes, that’s $24m they won’t be getting. Forget the argument that the women needed to win the case to set an example for young girls. To the grassroots groups, the settlement and the projected losses are actually robbing girls and boys of the support they need. Even worse, the sport is attracting fewer and fewer participants. Cone is hardly responsible for creating the long-running problem, but the states would argue that fixing it should be a higher priority than it is. To be sure, some of the state representatives have other motives. While the US women’s team and its fans are often held up as a beacon of progressive values, the same isn’t true of soccer as a whole in the US. The game, particularly at youth level, is popular in America’s conservative heartland, and some are still bitter about women’s players kneeling during the national anthem. Others think the women’s team is too cozy with former player Cone. And it’s easy to see that there are sexist elements to some of the complaints. After all, the US men’s team lost more money than the women’s team, while some of the members who supported former men’s players such as Eric Wynalda or Kyle Martino in the 2018 election now suddenly tout the need for “business acumen” with a female player at the helm. But those motivations are hardly the only driving forces behind the grassroots revolt. The states and other organizations believe they see through the women’s team’s rhetoric. If the USWNT are serious about fighting for girls and future generations, they say, shouldn’t the bulk of revenue be going to develop coaches, referees and players? Cone has recognized that she has some bridge-building to do. The national teams must do so as well. The men are still taking a rigid negotiating stance even though all available evidence shows they are more than adequately paid. And with men’s players now commanding large salaries from European powerhouses as well as MLS teams, it’s difficult to make a case that they need big money from international appearances to pad their incomes. The women, though, have more work to do. They’ve convinced a lot of supporters and columnists that their legal fight was essential. Now they need to convince those who actually look at the federation budget. And all federation members, from volunteers to the well-compensated national teamers, have to find a way to put things together. Otherwise, even with Cone in charge rather than Cordeiro, US Soccer may indeed go backward.",Sport/Football,The women’s team got equal pay but not everyone in US soccer is happy,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/10/the-womens-team-got-equal-pay-but-not-everyone-in-us-soccer-is-happy
