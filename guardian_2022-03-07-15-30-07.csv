3/7/2022,"New Zealand will rush a bill through parliament this week that will significantly ramp up its sanctions against Russia and its oligarchs, in line with its western allies. The Russia Sanctions Bill is the “first of its kind” in New Zealand, which has no legal framework for passing broader, unilateral sanctions and usually only does so when called on by the UN security council. As a permanent member of the body, Moscow has vetoed any action against it. “A bill of this nature has never been brought before our parliament, but with Russia vetoing UN sanctions we must act ourselves to support Ukraine and our partners in opposition to this invasion,” the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said. The country initially responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine with targeted travel bans, prohibiting exports to the military and suspending bilateral ministry consultations. “We have said throughout our response that no options were off the table, and that we’d continue to do more in line with New Zealand’s unequivocal opposition to Russia’s actions,” Ardern said. “Despite international condemnation and the resilience and resistance of the Ukrainian people, Russia’s assault continues, and so must our pressure.” The new sanctions would enable the government to freeze assets located in New Zealand and prevent those sanctioned from moving assets to the country or using its financial system as “a back door to get around sanctions” imposed by other countries, Ardern said. The new law would also allow for sanctions to be imposed on states that were complicit with Russia, including Belarus. Sanctions could also apply to trade, and financial institutions, as well as stopping the likes of Russian super yachts, ships and aircraft from entering New Zealand waters or airspace. The minister of foreign affairs, Nanaia Mahuta, said New Zealand had decided that a targeted sanctions bill is required “to show condemnation in the strongest possible terms”. “New Zealand continues to call on Russia to do what is right and immediately cease military operations in Ukraine and permanently withdraw to avoid a catastrophic loss of innocent life.” The government’s media release included a list of more than 100 individuals who would be affected by the government’s travel bans. The prime minister also said she would continue to consider a broader autonomous sanctions law, which would allow the country to unilaterally impose sanctions. That would be a turnaround for the government, which has twice shot down such a bill put forward by the opposition National party over concerns that the bill failed to adequately cover cybersecurity and human rights abuses. “Fast forward to this situation, that bill as it stood was not fit for purpose for what we needed to do, so we’ve created our own bespoke response, and now we’ll continue the wider autonomous sanctions work,” Ardern said. New Zealand has been under increasing pressure to increase its response, as other western nations draw on powers in Magnitsky laws, which, like the sanctions announced on Monday, target corrupt officials and human rights offenders. The architect of the US’s Magnitsky Act, Bill Browder, told RNZ on Monday that he was “surprised” New Zealand had not yet stepped up its response.",News/World news,New Zealand to ramp up Russia sanctions with ‘first of its kind’ law,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/new-zealand-to-ramp-up-russia-sanctions-with-first-of-its-kind-law
3/7/2022,"Morning everyone. I’m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories this morning. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has vowed to punish “every bastard” responsible for atrocities against civilians during the Russian invasion amid outrage at the death of eight people, including a mother and two children, who were trying to escape the shelling of a Kyiv suburb yesterday. In an impassioned address overnight, Zelenskiy warned Russian troops carrying out the attacks that the “only quiet place” that awaits them is the grave. “We will not forgive hundreds and hundreds of victims, thousands and thousands of sufferings … There will be a day of judgment.” The leaders of France and Turkey asked Russian president Vladimir Putin to allow evacuations in Kyiv and other besieged cities such as Mariupol and reports from Russia this morning suggest some humanitarian corridors will be opened. However, an adviser to Zelenskiy said last night that Russian forces had stepped up shelling of cities in the north, centre and south, and there were reports of a Russian assault on Mykolaiv. With a war crimes investigation already under way, Ukraine will today ask the United Nations’ top court to issue an emergency ruling requiring Russia to stop its invasion. A third round of Russian-Ukrainian talks is set for today. You can follow all the updates at our live blog and here’s what we know so far on day 12 of the war. Today will see emergency legislation rushed through the House of Commons targeting Russian oligarchs. The laws will create a register of overseas ownership of UK land and property, reform unexplained wealth orders and make it easier to prosecute those involved in breaking sanctions. A public appeal in the UK to provide aid for Ukraine has reached £100m, while a flashmob orchestra played a concert for Ukraine in Trafalgar Square. US secretary of state Antony Blinken has promised to escalate sanctions but said the war could last “some time”. He also said the western allies had discussed a ban on Russian oil imports, and the news sent the price of crude soaring to within sight of all-time record highs in early trade this morning. In Denmark, voters will decide in a referendum whether to overturn the country’s 30-year-old opt-out from EU defence policy. Gender gap – It will take 30 years to reach gender parity at senior levels of the financial services industry if nothing is done to improve the “frustratingly slow” current rate, the Treasury’s champion on the issue has warned. Amanda Blanc, who is also chief executive of the insurer Aviva, said women and business could not afford to wait that long to achieve equality. Research by the women-in-finance taskforce found the proportion of senior women among the 400 signatories increased by just one percentage point between 2018 and 2020, from 31% to 32%. Companies with more female leaders outperform those dominated by men, according to Commons research, but could be held back by a lack of investment and the risk of “childcare deserts” in parts of the country. Sporting chance – More than 1 million girls who thought of themselves as sporty at primary school lose interest in physical activity as teenagers, according to a study by Women in Sport. In a poll of 4,000 girls, 68% said that a fear of feeling judged prevented them from taking part, while 61% said they lacked confidence. Just under half (47%) said they were too busy with school work to carry on with sport. And girls were much more likely to say they used to be sporty but were no longer keen on exercise than boys (24%). Glass half full – Always look on the bright side of life. Or at least that is what a new study of army veterans in the US suggests after it found that optimists may live healthier, longer lives because they have fewer stressful events to cope with. Researchers found that while optimists reacted to, and recovered from, stressful situations in much the same way as pessimists, the optimists fared better emotionally because they had fewer stressful events in their daily lives. God squad – When Pope Francis suggested that nuns should “get out more” to avoid becoming “old maids”, a group of sisters in Italy took his advice to heart and formed the world’s first national football team for nuns. Their next big game is against their main rivals – a team of nuns from the Vatican – but the main aim is to evangelise as they exercise, the founder says. At least 15,000 flights have taken off from UK airports since March 2020 at less than 10% capacity or even with no passengers at all.

Workers can fight and beat the squeeze on wages, TUC boss Frances O’Grady says, inspired by B&Q distribution centre workers who rejected a 4% wage rise and instead secured a 6.7% deal. In an interview with the Guardian, O’Grady says working people are victims of inflation that has seen energy and food bills rise sharply in recent months, not the cause.

3/7/2022,"Last week, there was a leak. More accurately, a leaked rumour. It probably didn’t register with just about any person who does not play video games, but it was notable nonetheless. FIFA 23, the latest instalment of the hugely popular series, will feature the 2023 Women’s World Cup. It will also make women’s football more prominent than it has been since manufacturer EA Sports introduced female players to the long-running simulation game in 2015. Back then, there were only 12 women’s teams, all of which were international, with no domestic leagues. FIFA 23, however, will reportedly allow players to select women’s club sides for the very first time, including from the FA Women’s Super League, Frauen-Bundesliga, National Women’s Soccer League and Division 1 Féminine. A video game, of course, is just that – a fantasy. But it is also a fantasy with more than nine million active players across all platforms. And with the 2023 World Cup now 500 days away, there is genuine value in marketing the women’s game to the global masses. In little more than 16 months the world’s eyes will fall on Australia and New Zealand, the two hosts of the first tournament to be staged in the southern hemisphere. On Monday morning there were more eyes on a car crash on the Sydney Harbour Bridge than down below in front of the Opera House, where Matildas players and football officials made a press appearance to mark the first of what will undoubtedly be a few milestone events. Though it flew under the radar, it was also important, and appears – at least on the surface – to demonstrate a commitment to ensuring this opportunity will not be viewed as one that got away once the bright lights of the tournament have faded. The word “legacy” has a prominent part of the countdown vernacular. Football Australia’s official branding is called Legacy ’23, a five-pillared “ambitious plan to ensure we deliver positive and enduring benefits for Australia’s largest community sport, beyond 2023”. “We know that this tournament will take women’s football to another level, and we are committed to leveraging it to escalate the growth of women’s football in Australia,” said FA’s head of women’s football, Women’s World Cup legacy and inclusion, Sarah Walsh. “Through Legacy ‘23 we will deliver meaningful change including 50/50 gender participation, greater female representation in leadership roles and greater access and pathways at all levels of the game.” Indeed, for the first time in World Cup history, the First Nations names for the nine host cities have been weaved into the branding as part of a promise to make real, tangible improvements in the inclusion of Indigenous communities in both countries. The five Australian cities are referred to not just as Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney, but also Tarntanya, Meaanjin, Naarm, Boorloo and Gadigal. The New Zealand cities are Tāmaki Makaurau/Auckland, Ōtepoti/Dunedin, Kirikiriro/Hamilton, and Te Whanganui-a-Tara/Wellington. Both on the pitch and off, the gestures are laudable, and the federal and state governments says they are on board. But cold hard cash is what makes the world turn and football in this part of it is notorious for having none. Last year, FA chief executive James Johnson lobbied for $275m in government funding over an eight-year period to achieve its ambitious Legacy ’23 proposal, including $180m earmarked for a “female community football facility legacy fund” to reverse a long-standing paucity of infrastructure. He was told he would get only part of that sum. The government has offered some cash, including $12m to support high-performance objectives for the Matildas, Young Matildas and Junior Matildas such as international fixtures. It came after the Women’s Performance Gap Report painted a bleak outlook for the depth of Australia’s national team, a predicament highlighted by the Matildas’ quarter-final exit at January’s Asian Cup. And that is the elephant in the room: that Australia are expected to have eyes on the trophy but could not break the back of a confederation with no teams inside the world’s top nine. It has put coach Tony Gustavsson under significant pressure, though captain Sam Kerr says that is mainly external. “I think we’ve always had this happen to us as a team, where maybe before the World Cup we haven’t been performing or things have happened where they fired our coach, or got a changeover of coach right before the Olympics or the World Cup,” Kerr told Fox Sports on Monday. “For us that would be the worst thing in the world because starting fresh again, it’s just we’ve done it three or four times now. It happened when we lost Hesterine [de Reus in 2014], when we lost Staj [Alen Stajcic in 2019], when we lost Ante [Milicic in 2020]. It’s always a year out from a major tournament.” Internationally speaking, revenue will not rely solely on the host nations’ performances, and the presence of reigning world champions the United States along with Europe’s heavy hitters should bring a significant economic boost, especially as the world continues to reopen from Covid-19 restrictions. Add to that the presence of new countries in the expanded, 32-team competition, including Vietnam and Stajcic’s Philippines, with whom he has just signed a contract extension to guide the team through the tournament. “Seven teams are now confirmed – two for the first time,” said Jane Fernandez, Australia’s chief operating officer for the tournament. “Qualification will continue to gather momentum over the next 12 months with 25 nations set to secure qualification and join us in Australia and New Zealand 500 days from now for the biggest FIFA Women’s World Cup in history.”",Sport/Football,Women’s football ‘legacy’ championed with 500 days to go to 2023 World Cup,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/07/womens-football-legacy-championed-with-500-days-to-go-to-2023-world-cup
3/7/2022,"It will take 30 years to reach gender parity at senior levels of the financial services industry if nothing is done to improve the “frustratingly slow” current rate, the Treasury’s champion on the issue has warned. Amanda Blanc, who is also chief executive of the insurer Aviva, said women and business could not afford to wait that long to achieve equality. The government’s women in finance charter was launched in 2016 as a voluntary agreement committing firms to gender diversity targets. More than 400 City institutions have signed up to it, including Aviva, the Bank of England, London Stock Exchange, the fund manager BlackRock, the banks Morgan Stanley, Santander and Monzo, and the building society Nationwide. Research by the women in finance taskforce found the proportion of senior management among the 400 signatories who were female increased by just one percentage point between 2018 and 2020, from 31% to 32%. It calculated that at this rate, it would take the financial services industry another 30 years to achieve gender parity at senior levels. Blanc, who has run Aviva since July 2020 and was appointed by the Treasury as the women in finance charter champion a year ago, said: “Progress towards gender equality in the financial sector remains frustratingly slow. Women, companies and society cannot afford to wait 30 years when we can achieve this in 10. “We’ve got to work quicker and harder, for the sake of women, for the sake of society and because a more diverse business is a more productive and innovative one.” She unveiled a series of proposals to tackle the problem: mandating shortlists for senior positions with 50% female representation, greater use of psychometric testing in recruitment, removing male-biased recruitment advertising, creating diverse interview panels and mid-career returner programmes to help women move back into work. Her other recommendations included: advertising all jobs as flexible, publishing bonus payments of all senior managers, formal sponsorship programmes for women at all levels, full-pay equal parental leave and benefits packages that support women at key life stages including menopause. Blanc said senior female role models and zero-tolerance policies for harassment were crucial for improving culture and behaviour. She also recommended setting detailed annual gender representation targets for all parts of the organisation, a real-time dashboard to showcase progress against gender targets that is publicly available, and embedding gender parity targets into scorecards for all senior management linked to executives achieving gender parity targets. This means that bonus payments should be linked to executives achieving gender parity targets. The proposals, drawn up by the taskforce in partnership with the consultancy Bain & Company and published a day before International Women’s Day, are based on interviews with bosses of financial firms, academic research, and more than 100 responses to a survey of the charter’s signatories. Nearly six out of 10 women (58%) say caring responsibilities have stopped them applying for promotion or a new job, and one in five (19%) have left a job because it was too hard to balance work and care, according to separate new research by market researcher Ipsos UK and Business in the Community. While just over a third of all adults, and 44% of working adults, have caring responsibilities, the research found that they are not spread equally. Women account for 85% of sole carers for children and 65% of sole carers for older adults. More people from ethnic minority backgrounds (42%) have caring responsibilities than from white backgrounds.",News/Business,How long for UK gender pay gap to be bridged at top of finance?

3/7/2022,"Back in the days when they were still called comediennes, an older comedienne turns to a younger one and says: “What is your persona?” The younger woman is confused. Bob Hope and Lenny Bruce don’t have personas, she says. They are just allowed to be funny as themselves, so why isn’t she? “They have dicks,” snaps back Sophie Lennon, one of the most memorable characters in The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. In the hit Amazon show – set in 50s and 60s New York – Midge Maisel discovers her talent as a standup. She’s an accidental comic, getting up on stage at a Greenwich Village club one night, drunk and angry and confessional, after her husband leaves her for his secretary. At the time, there is really only one mainstream female standup: Lennon, whose persona is that of a Queens housewife, complete with feather duster, fat suit and grating catchphrase. Maisel, with her shocking, electrifying set – it ends with her getting arrested – represents a new style of comedy, particularly for women. Lennon and Maisel have been likened to real-life comics Phyllis Diller and Joan Rivers (the show’s creator, Amy Sherman-Palladino, has said Maisel is more of an amalgam of lots of people, including her father who was a standup). When Jane Lynch, who plays Lennon, read the script, she thought of Diller, whose act was a caricature of a 50s housewife. There had been others, such as Belle Barth, Rusty Warren and Moms Mabley. In 1939 Mabley, who had come from the black vaudeville circuit, became the first female comic to perform at the Harlem Apollo (the third season of Maisel features Mabley, played by Wanda Sykes, performing there). Mabley had a grandmotherly housewife persona but was more edgy than Diller, her act confronting gender and racial prejudice. It was Diller, though, who became the first female comic superstar. “In order to break through,” says Lynch, “you had to have material that spoke to men, because the club owners, the TV producers and the late-night hosts were men. You would cater your material to what they would think is funny – and something that men love is when it refers to them. You go, ‘I can’t get a boyfriend cos I’m ugly’ and right there you’re not threatening. You’re almost one of the guys, because the guys don’t want to go to bed with you.” Lynch’s character explains this problem to Maisel, referring to her beauty. “Men don’t want to laugh at you,” she says. “They want to fuck you. You can’t go up there and be a woman. You’ve got to be a ‘thing’.” Modern viewers can immediately tune into Maisel’s material about sex and the challenges of motherhood, as well as her sweary rants, all delivered in up-to-date dialogue. It’s not meant as a historical record, points out Yael Kohen, author of We Killed: The Rise of Women in American Comedy. “I think there is an aspect of the comedy and her point of view that is very modern,” she says, “and it’s being imposed on someone in that time period.” Whereas at the time, the comics who became successful, such as Diller and Rivers, were not “necessarily defying female stereotypes. Joan Rivers was joking about getting a husband.” In reality, it would be some years after Maisel’s debut that more subversive, intellectual comics such as Lily Tomlin would take off. There had been other women whose acts didn’t rely on a comic lack of self-esteem, such as Elaine May, but she was in improv, not standup. Diller told Kohen she wore a sack dress partly because looking funny was part of the act, but also “because I had such a great figure”. Kohen says: “There’s long been a tension between women’s looks and their sense of humour – this idea that a funny woman couldn’t be beautiful.” Rivers, with her black cocktail dress and pearls, challenged this to some extent. In her book, Kohen quotes a 1963 review of Rivers’ early act: “Female comics are usually horrors who de-sex themselves for a laugh. But Miss R remains visibly – and unalterably – a girl.” But, points out Kohen, Rivers was not a conventional beauty in the way Maisel is. “She cared about how she looked and she used that in her comedy, but it doesn’t mean the tension [between being beautiful and funny] wasn’t there.” It is also, adds Kohen, “not irrelevant” that Mrs Maisel is Jewish. “Many of the most famous women in comedy from the 1960s on were Jewish. It’s important to note that these women weren’t considered emblems of Wasp femininity. They were considered part of an ethnic minority and not conventionally beautiful. Jewish women were often considered an exception to the rule that women aren’t funny – Christopher Hitchens, for example, singled them out in his infamous essay Why Women Aren’t Funny. And it wasn’t always a compliment.” In the 60s, Treva Silverman – who would go on to write for the Mandy Moore Show but was rejected for Johnny Carson because she was a woman – was writing sketches for Upstairs at the Downstairs, the New York nightclub where many comics and musicians started their careers. “With topical revues,” she says, “nobody cared if it was a man or a woman. It was more of a cabaret atmosphere. There was not the kind of sexism there was with standup. My doing sketches was not that unusual for a woman.” Silverman and Rivers became friends. “Joan was so ambitious from the very beginning,” says Silverman. “She was in touch with absolutely every agent and they were not used to booking a female comedian. People would say ‘Well …’ and her agent would say, ‘Try her for one night’ because they knew that would mean booking her for a week.” What were Rivers’ early audiences like? “They would think, ‘What is she doing up there? She should be home stirring the omelette or whatever.’ But she was so likable. Men liked her immediately, because she was very pretty, even though she kept complaining she wasn’t.” Her act, says Silverman, “was absolutely from a female perspective. She talked about what it was like to be a woman, an unmarried woman when everybody else was doing the ‘right thing’. She was talking about feeling inferior, somewhat unattractive, being the odd person in not only a male-dominated world, but also not up to par with the rest of the women. But everything she complained that she didn’t have, of course she had.” In putting herself down, says Silverman, “she kind of knew that she would be more likable”. Robin Tyler was part of a double act in the 60s with her partner Patty Harrison. “Humour is the most aggressive medium there is,” she says. “The only way women were allowed to be aggressive is when they turned it on themselves. So you have Phyllis Diller and Joan Rivers with, ‘I’m not pretty enough.’” Tyler says she understands it, “because that’s what they had to do to make a living”. Diller told Kohen: “Women’s libbers hated what I was doing. They didn’t like my self-deprecation.” Harrison and Tyler had started joking about things like bra sizes, but then second-wave feminism took off. They read Betty Friedan’s 1963 book The Feminine Mystique and it felt like a wake-up call. “We said, ‘Why are we making jokes on ourselves?’” Women, continues Tyler, were questioning “what we thought was funny. Patty and I turned it around and did ‘Take my husband’ and ‘I don’t have penis envy – I have 12 at home in a drawer.’” This was towards the end of the 60s and reviews of their work called them threatening to men. “All we did was take the same material [male comics were doing about women] and turn it on men.” Tyler enjoys The Marvelous Mrs Maisel, which has just started its fourth series, not least because it echoes some of her own career, in particular when Maisel and her family go on holiday to the Catskill Mountains, where popular resorts attracted affluent Jewish families. “I used to perform as a singer in ‘the Borscht Belt’. The comics there, I loved them, all the Jewish comics, but it was still sexist.” Like Maisel, Harrison and Tyler performed for US troops but, unsurprisingly, their feminist act did not go down as well as Maisel’s funny – but extremely feminine – material. On a comedy tour in New Zealand, Tyler says the man who booked them for one gig was so angry that they were encouraging the women in their audience to organise liberation movements, he shot at them. “We aggravated a lot of people because not only were we funny on stage, we were activists off stage. And they had never seen women use comedy as a weapon.” They mostly played colleges, rather than clubs. “Why would we want to play clubs where we played to sexist audiences? We were never going to end up in Vegas.” In the 70s, they made an attempt to go more mainstream when they were approached to make TV, but they didn’t fit. Tyler remembers getting a call from Fred Silverman, the influential TV executive. “We said, ‘We’re lesbians.’ He said, ‘That’s OK. Just don’t tell anybody.’ They were trying to make us do stupid sketches of stupid women and we hated it. They made four pilots with us, and it didn’t work out. Not only were we women-aggressive, we were lesbians-aggressive, so that was really too much.” TV, she says, was like an extension of the comedy circuit. “It wasn’t just sexist. They had to neutralise us.”",Arts/Culture,‘I don’t have penis envy.

The chart shows the view looking west-south-west from London at 1930 GMT on 7 March 2022. The moon will be a waxing crescent with just 26% of its visible surface illuminated. A dark sky, well away from streetlights and other light pollution, and a pair of binoculars will be your best allies on Monday night. You do not need a large pair of binoculars, as you won’t be able to hold them steady enough to see anything in the sky. Instead a pair of 7x35s or 7x50s will be best. Uranus will be easily visible in such instruments, but first, take the opportunity to look at the moon. In its crescent phases, there are plenty of dramatic shadows that accentuate the stark lunar landscape. In the coming months, we’ll use more detailed finder charts to locate Uranus with binoculars.

3/7/2022,"Outside a giant B&Q warehouse in Worksop Frances O’Grady is braving the icy rain to talk chat to members of the Unite union fresh from an 11-week long dispute. This is classic red wall territory. Worksop forms part of Bassetlaw, the Nottinghamshire constituency won by the Conservatives at the 2019 election by more than 14,000 votes. The distribution centre is on the site of what was once the Manton colliery and – in a move redolent with symbolism – a Unite picket line was set up where miners had gathered during the year-long pit strike of 1984-5. There is one crucial difference. Whereas the miners eventually lost their industrial battle, O’Grady, the TUC’s general secretary, is greeted by workers celebrating victory. Having balloted to reject a 4% pay offer, Unite members at B&Q’s main UK distribution centre stood firm. Eventually, the 450 warehouse workers secured a 6.7% pay deal backdated to July. With recognition and bonus payments on top they will receive the equivalent of a 10.75% rise. “The workers from B&Q are a great example of what is possible, affordable and just,” says O’Grady. “They should never have had to go on strike to get a fair share but they were determined. They were in it for the long haul.” O’Grady is visiting Nottinghamshire to see for herself how workers are coping with Britain’s cost of living crisis and dismisses the idea that excessive pay rises are making the problem worse. “It is plain to see that it is not pay rises that are driving inflation. According to the Bank of England’s own estimates real [inflation-adjusted] wages are going to fall again this year. Working families are victims of inflation, not the cause of it,” she says. “I don’t see wages taking off. I don’t know how anybody can make that case. I don’t find the comparisons with the 1970s convincing. If we don’t get wages rising again we will hold back economic growth. There is plenty of evidence that working families are really struggling, and not just low-paid workers. Middle-income people are feeling it too.” Comparisons with the 1970s are certainly inappropriate when it comes to the strength of organised labour. Trade union membership is less than half of its 13.2 million peak in 1979, and down to 13% in the private sector, according to the latest government figures. But although strikes have been made more difficult by measures passed by Conservative administrations, it is still possible for workers to take action if they go through the necessary legal hoops. In recent months, two factors have emboldened workers to stand up to their employers: shortages of labour and making ends meet. At a Worksop hotel, O’Grady listens to workers from the Riverside bakery in Nottingham explain why they are balloting for industrial action. Current rates of pay for operatives who make quiches for big supermarket chains including Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Marks and Spencer are £9.02 an hour – 11p above the minimum wage. From April, the bakery workers have been offered £9.61 an hour – again 11p above the minimum wage – but the employers have sought to claw back some of the increase by pegging premium rates at the weekend at the old £9.02 an hour rate. A spokesperson for The Compleat Food Group said increases of between 6.5% and 9.5% to basic rates represented “a very favourable offer”. Results of the ballot will be known on Tuesday, but the union is expecting a big majority in support of action. Cheryl Pidgeon, Unite’s regional officer for the East Midlands, said: “I’m really proud of them. I’m really proud they are fighting back. The company says nobody else is getting this, but nobody else stood and fought. “The workers at this site have been key workers throughout the pandemic, feeding the nation whilst risking their lives at work. The company refuse to open the books, but we know they made profits last year as the volumes went up and workers were being run ragged re: production requirements.” O’Grady says the bakery dispute is an example of a company looking to fund a wage increase by redistributing the pay bill so that workers are worse off. She says the big-name supermarket chains need to stop turning a blind eye to what is going on. “I don’t know how whoever thought of it sleeps at night. All those who are supplied by the bakery need to take a share of the responsibility,” she says. Even before the Russian invasion of Ukraine sent energy prices soaring even higher, the Bank of England was forecasting a record 2% drop in living standards this year. Andrew Bailey, the Bank’s governor, was slapped down by 10 Downing Street for saying workers needed to show pay restraint to help tackle inflation. O’Grady is on the Bank’s court of directors and will not talk directly about Bailey’s comments, but says in general terms there is a danger of people in power being out of touch with people’s lives. The list of out-of-touch people, in the TUC general secretary’s view, includes Bassetlaw’s Conservative MP, Brendan Clarke-Smith, who told the B&Q workers they would be better off accepting the 4% and cancelling their union membership. “There is nothing left to squeeze”, she says. “With strong unions, working people at least have a chance of a fair shot. If you set out to weaken unions then you are deliberately weakening the bargaining power of working people. When I go out on the road I get angry but I also get encouraged. People have to believe we can win but we have to organise.” One of those organising low-paid workers is Vicky Wass, a care worker and GMB union rep for Bassetlaw. “I have got members going to food banks or doing two jobs, and even then, finding they can’t make ends meet.” Wass’s message is a simple one. For many workers it is a question of eat or heat, which may explain the rumblings of discontent in red wall seats.",News/Politics,"Workers can fight and beat the wage squeezes, says Frances O’Grady ",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/07/workers-can-fight-and-beat-the-wage-squeezes-says-frances-ogrady
3/7/2022,"Another psychological drama in which an enviably well-designed family house eerily seems to take on a life of its own and cause trouble (see also: The Girl Before and Finding Alice). Something is afoot from the off in this four-parter, peppered across the week, as Fi (a perplexed Tuppence Middleton) returns home to find a new family has moved in without her knowledge. What has happened? And why can’t she get hold of her estranged husband, Bram (a slippery Martin Compston)? Cue flashbacks to when they first moved into their dream home, started a family and dealt with Bram’s affair. It’s silly, juicy and guiltily good – with an attention-grabbing opening-episode cliffhanger. Hollie Richardson Some worthwhile history to go with the drama as Prof Carl Chinn – who has a distant family connection to the gang – explores the stories of the real-life Tommy Shelbys. Turns out the real Peakies were deeply unpleasant bullies and most of their activities lacked even a smidgeon of outlaw glamour. Who knew? Phil Harrison The story of eight-year-old Saffie-Rose Roussos, who went to the 2017 Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena with her mother and sister, is not an easy one to hear. She was the youngest victim of the bombing and a report suggested she might have survived if she had received better first aid at the scene. Panorama investigates her and her parents’ story. Hannah Verdier Following on from last year’s intimate documentary Harvey and Me, which explored Price’s relationship with her teenage son Harvey – who lives with a range of complex medical and behavioural conditions including autism – this unfiltered, one-hour film catches up with them as Harvey prepares to leave home for the first time. HR Continuing BBC Three’s tradition of using fact-based drama to illuminate urgent social issues, this one-off is set in a distribution warehouse where the young employees are closely monitored to ensure maximum efficiency. A trainee manager (Aimee-Ffion Edwards) pushes her pregnant friend (Poppy Lee Friar) to work without respite. Jack Seale It’s Valentine’s Day and, predictably, things don’t run too smoothly for our new couple. Jessie’s ex-boyfriend is sniffing around again, while Tom is offered a role that requires him to work away for a while. Worst of all, though, is when Tom calls Jessie “kooky” and “quirky”. HR Ninjababy (Yngvild Sve Flikke, 2021), 12.10am, Film4This film offers a comic, creative take on the potentially fraught story of a young woman who becomes pregnant but is far from the maternal type. Kristine Kujath Thorp’s Oslo-based Rakel is a would-be comic artist, so when she discovers she is six months gone already, she conjures up the foetus as an animated “sneaky ninjababy” – one who illuminates her thoughts and feelings through quirky if challenging asides. But Yngvild Sve Flikke’s drama does have a darker side, too, as the disorganised, fearful Rakel deals with the dread prospect of motherhood.

3/7/2022,"Predictions of dark forces being unleashed by an evil vixen hung over social media in Japan on Monday after a famous volcanic rock said to kill anyone who comes into contact with it was found split in two. According to the mythology surrounding the Sessho-seki, or killing stone, the object contains the transformed corpse of Tamamo-no-Mae, a beautiful woman who had been part of a secret plot hatched by a feudal warlord to kill Emperor Toba, who reigned from 1107-1123. Legend has it that her true identity was an evil nine-tailed fox whose spirit is embedded in the hunk of lava, located in an area of Tochigi prefecture, near Tokyo, famous for its sulphurous hot springs. Its separation into two roughly equal parts, believed to have occurred within the past few days, has spooked online users who noted that, according to folklore, the stone continually spews poisonous gas – hence its name. While the stone was said to have been destroyed, and its spirit exorcised by a Buddhist monk who scattered its pieces across Japan, many Japanese prefer to believe that its home is on the slopes of Mount Nasu. Visitors to the area, a popular sightseeing spot, recoiled in horror at the weekend after witnesses posted photos of the fractured stone, a length of rope that had been secured around its circumference lying on the ground. “I feel like I’ve seen something that shouldn’t be seen,” one Twitter user said in a post that has attracted almost 170,000 likes. 九尾の狐の伝説が残る、殺生石にひとりでやってきました。縄でぐるっと巻かれた真ん中の大きな岩がそれ…のはずなのですが、なんと岩は真っ二つに割れて、縄も外れていました。漫画だったらまさに封印が解かれて九尾の狐に取り憑かれるパターンで、見てはいけないものを見てしまった気がします。 pic.twitter.com/wwkb0lGOM9 While others speculated that the demon spirit of Tamamo-no-Mae had been resurrected after almost 1,000 years, local media said cracks had appeared in the rock several years ago, possibly allowing rainwater to seep inside and weaken its structure. The stone, which was registered as a local historical site in 1957, was mentioned in Matsuo Basho’s seminal work The Narrow Road to the Deep North, and has inspired a Noh play, a novel and an anime film. Masaharu Sugawara, the head of a local volunteer guide group, told the Yomiuri Shimbun it was a “shame” the stone had split because it was a symbol of the area, but agreed that nature had simply taken its course. Local and national government officials will meet to discuss the stone’s fate, according to the Shimotsuke Shimbun. The newspaper quoted a Nasu tourism official as saying he would like to see the Sessho-seki restored to its original form – presumably with its demonic inhabitant sealed within.",News/World news,"Japan’s ‘killing stone’ splits in two, releasing superstitions amid the sulphur springs",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/japans-killing-stone-splits-in-two-releasing-superstitions-and-toxic-gases
3/7/2022,"A century ago in the ateliers of Montparnasse in Paris, surrealism was born from the gloom of the first world war that had engulfed and devastated Europe. The cultural movement led by the French writer and poet André Breton would give rise to artists of international renown including Max Ernst, Joan Miró, René Magritte, Yves Tanguy, and Salvador Dalí. There were women surrealists too, many of them dismissed as muses and too often remembered only in terms of their romantic relationships with the famous men but now recognised in their own right – among them Leonora Carrington, Dorothea Tanning, Meret Oppenheim and Frida Kahlo. Today, under the shadow of a new European conflict, the literary and artistic movement is enjoying another golden age with international events and exhibitions including the first-ever auction dedicated to surrealist works in the city of its birth. The main attraction of the Sotheby’s sale Surrealism and its Legacy will be a rare work by Cuban-born surrealist Francis Picabia from his Nu de dos series never before seen at auction and considered the “Pulp Fiction of painting”, according to Sotheby’s expert Thomas Bompard, and Pavonia from Picabia’s Transparency series estimated at €8m (£6.5m). Bompard, vice-president of Sotheby’s France, said the artist is one of the underrated stars of surrealism. “I am meeting more and more people wanting us to source great works by Picabia and those showing the greatest interest are contemporary artists like [Jeff] Koons, [John] Baldessari, who inherited his legacy and who are grateful that Picabia paved the way for them.” He added: “Surrealism is almost 100 years old but to me it has never seemed so young. The creativity, the beauty, the artistry and artistic technique … the surrealists were looking for beauty, poetry, mystery and going into uncharted waters.” The term “surrealism” was coined around 1919 but the official start of the movement is considered to be Breton’s The Surrealist Manifesto, published in 1924. Surrealism was not a style of painting, but, a state of mind, its followers argued. It was flexible and had no rules, making it hard to pin down. Each surrealist artist chose their own form of expression, making the genre too diverse to be strictly categorised. The Paris sale, preceded by an exhibition of the works by Picabia as well as Magritte, Man Ray, Tanning and others, will feature a special section devoted to the work of female surrealists whose work, Bompard said, showed a “self-awareness and intuition” lacking in work by the male contemporaries who overshadowed and sidelined them. “Most had romantic relationships with the surrealist artists and they were regarded as muses or part of the artistic scene only as partners of male artists. Now they are correctly generating interest in their own right,” Bompard added. The surrealism event also includes the selling of a private collection owned by André Mourgues – the partner of celebrated avant garde Paris gallery owner and former ballet dancer Alexander Iolas – including works by Ernst, Claude Lalanne, Magritte, Pablo Picasso and Dali and valued at more than €5m. Mourgues, now 83, spent 25 years with Iolas and met many of the artists whose paintings he is selling. “The surrealists were wonderful people, cultivated, polite, gentle … I was just 25 and had finished my military service when I met Iolas and it was the start of one long party of the spirit” Mourgues told the Guardian. “The paintings have now gone from my walls now but have left their marks. They had an extraordinary presence and I will miss them. “It’s difficult to let them go, but they need to be properly looked after and preserved and I no longer have the energy to do this. “I am an old man without children who is turning a page and hoping the works will bring pleasure to someone else now.” Surrealism is currently enjoying a modern renaissance; last week Magritte’s l’Empire des Lumières sold for £59.4m with bidding from 46 countries to become the most valuable painting ever sold at auction in Europe. The surrealist calendar this year holds exhibitions across the world, among them Surrealism Beyond Borders – now at the Tate Modern after its transfer from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Auctioneers Bonhams will also hold a surrealist sale, The Mind’s Eye in London next week featuring work by Ernst, Bréton, Dalí and Grace Pailthorpe. Bompard said he had scoured private collections for the Sotheby’s auction. “I’m very excited by this sale. We are very proud of the quality of the works we have sourced and I’m really impatient to see how the market will react. I hope it will generate a great deal of enthusiasm,” he said. “It’s impossible not to take into consideration the difficult time Europe is going through. Surrealism was born out of the ashes of an ancient world, destroyed after the first world war. “If there had been no war, there would have been no surrealism. Artists realised the world as they knew it was gone and had a desire to invent something radically different. “The context of surrealism has always been a very political movement. The Surrealists really believed art could and should change life. “In today’s world more and more complex, contradictory, multipolar, surrealism resonates more because it embraces all the contradictions instead of resolving them.” Pre-sale exhibition: Surrealism and Its Legacy, Galerie Charpentier, 76 rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honoré, 75008 Paris from 11-15 March.

3/7/2022,"At long last, the sunshine warms my back, as I take the narrow lane past the church of St Ffraed/St Bridget, whose slate-hung walls pay silent testament to the uncompromising weather of this coast. Tightly trimmed hedges crown the double-walled stone banks that bound the track, the smooth water-rounded cobbles sourced from the beach only a few hundred yards away. Below compact patches of snowdrops, the wheel ruts are full of turbid rainwater from the recent storms, and it’s a relief when the route opens out into a series of large fields. From the west, the constant roar of surf across the shelving beach merges with the strong breeze sweeping through and patterning the grass. This close to the sea, spring growth in the gently sloping pasture is already under way – with the grass well above the toes of my boots. The stone banks here have been infiltrated by generations of rabbits, their tunnels forming a labyrinth in the earthen core of the walls. Crossing a low rise, I surprise a buzzard perched on the top of the hedge, it lifts slowly with long, measured wingbeats before circling away to the north. In the next field, a group of three curlews call and swoop low across the grass, causing brief confusion among a noisy party of starlings, which lift, swirl and drop again in their wake. The low cliffs along this coast are eroding quickly, and the 19th-century lime kilns now appear perilously close to the retreating edge. Almost overgrown with briar, these four remnants of a crucial historic trade stand out for the sheer quality of their stonework – the blocks dressed and tightly set despite being abandoned for over a century, when the coming of the railway offered cheaper, simpler fertiliser solutions for farmers. Dropping down towards the sea, the path follows the crest of a pebble beach, torn and hollowed by the last storm – with great tongues of stone and debris inundating a neighbouring field of root crops. The loose cobbles make for difficult walking, and the way feels much longer than it is, but eventually I turn wearily inland towards Llanrhystud – the sound of the sea slowly fading behind me.
