""I look at the unconventional warfare or the fight that's happening there, and I think you're going to see a lot of guerrilla warfare coming soon,"" U.S. Army retired Lt. Col. Scott Mann said. ""These cities are going to get overrun, and it's going to be a long, long haul for the Russians,"" Mann continued. ""If they think because they occupy these cities, that they're done – if you look at the fighting spirit of the Ukrainian people – they are in for a nasty guerrilla warfare campaign that is going to bleed them dry."" The retired Green Beret commander told Fox News the situation in Ukraine is unfolding opposite to the way things played out in Afghanistan. UKRAINE NUCLEAR PLANT UPDATE: RUSSIAN ATTACK RELEASED NO RADIATION, IAEA CHIEF SAYS: LIVE UPDATES ""I’ve got to think that the Taliban are not liking what's going on in Ukraine right now,"" Mann said. ""People are watching that and it is inspiring, regardless of your politics, to see people make a stand like that."" Mann, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, founded Task Force Pineapple, a group that helped evacuate Afghan refugees after the country fell into the hands of the Taliban last year. The group is not involved in Ukraine because, according to Mann, the circumstances are different. ""Even though it is horrific warfare, you have kind of a linear battlefield, and you have nation states,"" said Mann. ""I think volunteer groups, we have to be really careful about how we engage here and what we do."" Mann equated the final days of the Afghanistan withdrawal to the ""wild, wild west."" He said Pineapple came together because of his team’s specific knowledge of the country, which wouldn’t translate in Ukraine. HOW HUNDREDS OF AFGHANS WERE SAVED FROM THE TALIBAN BY VETERANS IN A DIGITAL DUNKIRK: THE LAST 96 He told Fox News there are three reasons why the war in Ukraine is unfolding differently from the fall of Afghanistan. ""The first one is leadership,"" Mann said. ""If you contrast just the internal leadership at senior levels inside Ukraine versus Afghanistan, it is stark,"" he continued. ""You have the president of Ukraine saying ‘We don't need a ride, we need ammo,’ … ‘if you can't control the sky, give me planes,’ versus [then-Afghan President-Ashraf] Ghani and his staff scrambling for helicopters unannounced to flee and leave their people high and dry."" Ukraine’s embrace of nationalism is the second, according to Mann. ""Ukraine has a national identity, and it runs deep, and they fight for it,"" Mann told Fox News. ""Afghanistan historically has not been as keen on a national identity,"" he continued. ""It's primarily a status society, a tribal society."" ""The final one is the nature of the threat,"" he said. ""If you look at Ukraine, they're facing an external threat,"" Mann continued. ""Nothing unifies people more than an external threat"" ""It brings us together fast, whether it's a hurricane or the Russian bear,"" he said. ""Whereas with the Taliban, that was an internal threat, that was a long-term insurgency that, you know, really applied a thousand cuts to the Afghan government.""",World/Fox News,"Russia in for nasty guerrilla warfare campaign that will bleed them dry, former Green Beret says",https://news.yahoo.com/russia-nasty-guerrilla-warfare-campaign-155948384.html
3/6/2022,"By Anne Kauranen and Johan Ahlander HELSINKI (Reuters) - Sweden and Finland will further strengthen their security cooperation in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the prime ministers of both countries said on Saturday, but they were non-committal on joining NATO. ""Russia's war against a sovereign European nation puts the European security order at risk. In this changing security environment, Finland and Sweden will further strengthen our cooperation,"" Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin told reporters in Helsinki at a joint news conference with Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson. Sweden and Finland have strong historic ties and a close military cooperation, including joint drills and information sharing. The invasion, called a ""special military operation"" by Russia, has also forced a quick change in attitude towards NATO in both countries, which are currently outside the NATO-alliance. Polls in recent days showed a majority for joining NATO in both countries for the first time ever. Marin said it was ""understandable"" that more people in both Sweden and Finland now want to join NATO. [L2N2V712H] ""We are now having this discussion in Finland,"" Marin said. ""We will have these discussions within parliament, with the president, within the government and between the parties."" In Sweden, the governing Social Democrats have long resisted calls from the centre-right opposition to join NATO. Andersson said it was natural that the discussion should come up again, but avoided questions on Sweden joining the military alliance. ""The security situation has been altered in a dramatic way,"" Andersson said. ""I have met the party leaders from the other Swedish parties several times in the last week and we are discussing a number of issues,"" she said. The two countries already have a close cooperation with NATO and are invited to all consultations on the Ukraine crisis. Secretary General Stoltenberg said in January they could join the alliance ""very quickly"" if they decided to apply for membership. Finland's President Sauli Niinisto said on Friday the United States and Nordic countries would ""initiate a clear process to step up defense and security cooperation"" after a meeting with U.S. President Biden that included a call to Magdalena Andersson.
