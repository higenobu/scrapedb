2/20/2022,"The number of specialist teachers of the deaf in England is at its lowest for a decade, leading to warnings that the decline is leaving hearing-impaired children “fighting for their futures”. The number has fallen by 16.5% since 2011, a report by the Consortium for Research into Deaf Education shows. The report found there are 887 fully qualified teachers of the deaf, compared with 1,062 in 2011.  The National Deaf Children’s Society (NDCS) fears the decline will worsen the achievement gap between deaf and hearing children. Deaf children already fall behind at every stage of school, the charity said, including a whole grade at GCSE. More than half of teachers (53%) are over 50, according to the report, prompting concerns that staffing levels may further drop in the next 10 to 15 years without intervention. Nina Greaves, 44, a social worker in Lincoln, said support from their teacher of the deaf was a lifeline when her six-year-old son, Marshall, was identified as deaf as a newborn. “Straightaway, she just normalised everything,” she said. “I didn’t know anything about deafness before.” The support began when Marshall was a baby, with the teacher visiting monthly to give advice about the acoustics in the family’s home, lip-reading and other techniques. Now he is at school, his current teacher of the deaf visits him there, checking his hearing aids and giving teachers training. With the right support, deaf children can achieve everything other children can, the NDCS said. Almost 80% of deaf children attend mainstream schools without specialist provision. Marshall is now in Year 2, and a “testament to the support” the family has received. “He’s not struggling at all at school: he’s very good with his speech, he’s an avid reader,” Greaves said. Mike Hobday, director of policy and campaigns at the NDCS, said: “Teachers of the deaf play an absolutely crucial role, but year after year they’ve been cut just to balance the books. As a result, deaf children are left fighting for their futures and falling behind at every stage of school. We need urgent action to fix this issue, but there’s no guarantee that more funding for schools will be enough to provide exactly what deaf pupils need.” The NDCS is calling for a £1.3m bursary to replace the teachers of the deaf who have been lost and “make sure every deaf child gets the right support”. A Department for Education spokesperson said: “All children and young people, including those who are deaf or have a hearing impairment, should receive the support they need to succeed in their education. That’s why there is a legal requirement for teachers to hold relevant mandatory qualifications when teaching classes of pupils who have a sensory impairment.”",News/Society,Deaf children falling behind as specialist teacher numbers fall,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/20/deaf-children-england-specialist-teacher-numbers-fall
2/20/2022,"Fit for a prince. “By royal appointment” has traditionally been a recommendation of provenance, quality and trustworthiness. A royal handle today serves as a warning of potential ignominy. As Oscar Wilde didn’t quite write, for one prince to be embroiled in scandal may be regarded as a misfortune, two looks like a pattern. Buckingham Palace must be fervently hoping that no one has anything on Prince Edward. Prince Andrew is paying a large sum to a woman he claims never to have met rather than face interrogation about her accusations of sexual assault before a jury in New York. Prince Charles denies knowing anything about cash for honours, but says he will help the police with their inquiries into whether a Saudi billionaire’s payments to royal charities bought the donor a gong.  At times like these, when questions swirl around the conduct of two of the Queen’s sons, it would be usual for the monarch to seek succour from her prime minister. But Boris Johnson is not the go-to person for advice on how to avoid disgrace. Some members of Her Majesty’s government are even taking secret pleasure in the travails of the crown. It would suit Downing Street if the bad odours around the House of Windsor distracted public attention from the great stink generated by Number 10. Britain is not unfamiliar with scandals of political and royal varieties, but this combination goes to the apex of the state in a way without precedent. We have the prime minister and the heir to the throne involved in investigations by the Metropolitan police, itself so poisoned with scandal that Dame Cressida Dick has been forced to quit as commissioner of the Met. This is happening at a time when the reputations of many other estates of the realm are severely corroded. Rarely a month, or a week, passes without one institution or another being put in the dock for incompetence, misconduct, cronyism or corruption. Faith in MPs has not recovered from the expenses outrages that were exposed in 2009 and it was not long ago that parliament was rocked by inquiries and resignations over sexual harassment and bullying. The House of Lords is tainted every time the bloated ranks of unelected peers are further swollen by the introduction of more party donors and muckers of the prime minister, a sleazy game that did not start with Mr Johnson, but one that he has played with characteristic brazenness. The bankers have never restored the trust they lost when their avaricious recklessness led to the financial crash. This year’s bumper bonus season will do nothing to endear them to those feeling the squeeze on living standards. The deaths caused by the Grenfell Tower inferno, and the legacy of misery inflicted on the tens of thousands of people trapped in unsafe and unsellable flats, have made pariahs of the construction industry. The reputation of the army has been diminished by defeats on the battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq along with bullying and sexual assault cases. The established church has expressed its “shame” over its failures to deal with sexual predators in dog collars. The pandemic has not seen the civil service purr like a Rolls Royce, but backfire like an old banger. The prime minister’s principal private secretary sent the invites to the notorious “bring your own booze party” in the garden of Number 10 and the hapless cabinet secretary had to recuse himself from leading an inquiry into lockdown-busting in Downing Street when it was revealed that his own office had hosted a quiz. Journalists cannot be holier than thou, because the media has also debased itself. The tabloid press was disgraced by phone-hacking. The BBC has often been on the rack, most recently over the Martin Bashir business. Not just one or two of our once-venerated institutions are in trouble. The credibility and moral authority of the entire structure of public life is shuddering. These multiple crises in multiple institutions have features in common. One overarching theme is a paucity of high-calibre personnel. Where are the leaders with the quality and strength of character to infuse the organisations they head with decent values? The Johnson government was guaranteed to be engulfed in opprobrium from the moment that Tory MPs decided to give the premiership to an amoral man. The Queen commands huge public respect, but she is notoriously reluctant to confront issues within her family. It took a long time and intense pressure before Prince Andrew was stripped of his military titles and royal patronages. Three of the past four Met commissioners have been forced to quit. I struggle to decide whether leading London’s constabulary is too much for any one person or if the police are incapable of producing anyone with the smarts and grip to drive reform. Other shared characteristics of dysfunctional institutions are hostility to legitimate criticism, an unwillingness to acknowledge mistakes and a resistance to being held accountable. All these were factors in the Post Office scandal. Hundreds of postmasters were wrongly accused of theft, fraud and embezzlement based on faulty evidence from a computer system known to be unreliable. Ruination was brought down on the reputations, livelihoods and families of wholly innocent people. Some were imprisoned, many were heavily fined, a lot were made bankrupt. The largest miscarriage of justice in recent British history, it is absolutely despicable. Yet none of the Post Office’s leadership at the time has been held to account. Nor has anyone from Fujitsu, the company to blame for the faulty software. Nor have any of the civil servants or politicians with supervisory responsibilities. More than 20 years since the first false prosecutions, a public inquiry is finally underway, but it is too late for many of the victims, at least four of whom are believed to have taken their own lives. The political scientist David Runciman identified another pathology of sickly institutions when he wrote that degeneration is often sourced in “a growing sense of impunity among small networks of elites. As British society has become more unequal it has created pockets of privilege whose inhabitants are tempted to think that the normal rules don’t apply to them.” He wrote that eight years ago and it rings even truer today. The princes were cocooned in plush pockets of privilege from the moment they were born. The prime minister has made a career of behaving as if normal rules don’t apply to him. It is dangerous when institutions are populated with entitled characters who believe they are superior to other citizens. Unchecked, this will inevitably lead to reprehensible conduct. The abuse of power reached a murderous level in the case of Wayne Couzens, the Met officer who abducted and killed Sarah Everard. The fall of Dame Cressida was in part impelled by the publication of a searing report by the Independent Office for Police Conduct into misogyny, racism and other bigotries within the force. It revealed messages between officers in which one bragged about hitting his girlfriend, another told a female colleague he would “happily rape you”, jokes were made about killing black children and abuse was directed at Muslims and disabled people. In other walks of life, behaviour so disgusting would be career-ruining. Yet nine of the officers investigated kept their jobs and two were promoted. From bad coppers to the delinquent at Number 10, from the lords of finance to the construction barons, from princes to dodgy parliamentarians, a culture of impunity is often at the root of institutional putrefaction. Left untreated, rot spreads. When wrongdoing by reprobate politicians goes unpunished, rogue police officers are emboldened to think that they can also get away with anything. Once upon a time, Britons would have been astonished and appalled to find scandal simultaneously bespoiling their royal family, prime minister and largest police force. We are less shockable now. There’s a good reason, which is that there is much less naive reverence for institutions than there was in the past. There’s also a bad reason for our diminished capacity to be scandalised by scandal. We have become wearily accustomed to seeing the public trust betrayed. Where once jaws would have dropped, grotesque misconduct in public life often provokes no more than a fleeting furore or a resigned shrug. That makes us part of the problem, too. When we expect to be let down, we settle for further decay. The British won’t get better service from their institutions until they start demanding it and so insistently that they can’t be ignored.

2/20/2022,"My friend had a birthday party. It was raucous and fantastic, stretching from the afternoon through to the night, two or more locations apparently, three types of cake, a very nice giant couscous salad, karaoke. I haven’t been to a party in years, which meant I entered feeling thrilled but semi-high with awkward anticipation – I couldn’t quite remember how to stand, or the appropriate greetings, and I was very aware of the thickness of my mascara. The room was filled with people I hadn’t seen since before the events, and they came with their new hairstyles, new children, new homes, new bodies, new griefs. I’d thought a lot about parties since being locked down, remembering them variously as orgiastic performances of joy and nightmarish scenes with terrible teeth in their terrible jaws. This was neither, by the time I left anyway, mid-evening dripping in children, but it was invigorating still, and I remembered the truths of parties, how part of their thrill is in allowing no more than a centimetre of conversation at a time, the meetings so brief, a hard shot of social life to be thrown back and followed with lemon. It was on our way home that I caught the thought that had been sneaking up on me all afternoon. Talking to friends again had reminded me how, over the pandemic, ghost sightings had soared.  The news was reported around Halloween, so I chose to ignore it of course, leaving it for the fairweather ghost story enthusiasts. People like me, bred on horror, able to recall the names of every poltergeist victim from here to Hull, do not require a nice little fright to make the Haribo harvested from neighbours taste sweeter. In the New York Times a paranormal researcher called John EL Tenney said he used to receive between two and five reports of a haunted house a month, but when the pandemic began it was not unusual for him to get five to 10 a week. “It does seem to have something to do with our heightened state of anxiety, our hyper-vigilance,” he said. Going to that party was like seeing 50 ghosts, all at once, but also like the moment when you realise you have become one. Perhaps you’re sick, now, of revelations about the pandemic and how we have changed. I often think I am, and then another one smacks me around the cheeks and forces me to reconsider the shape of us. Remeeting old friends again after everybody has endured two years of this peculiar discomfort, we come face to face with time. Our memories of who these people are seem suddenly unreliable – those people have gone. As have the years we lost, the dinners, divorces, weddings, funerals, the chance to see their children’s awkward phase, the chance to see their greys come in. These were the people we drunkenly formed ourselves with, on New Year’s Eves at 6am and on the uncarpeted floors of flats off Brick Lane, and now they were middle-aged, which meant we were, too. The reason people saw ghosts over lockdown was (according to Kurt Gray, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina) that at moments of “great unease” there is an increased drive to find meaning. Plus there’s the complication that disease itself shares psychological parallels with a “malevolent spirit”, stalking its victims. But I am seeing ghosts now that lockdown is over, on bridges, where I am suddenly breathless at the sight of the river, and the hundreds of times I’d passed over it and the hundreds of people I’d passed over it with. At work, where an empty office echoes with expired conversations, and at parties where we stand back to back with the people we were, and the people we failed to become. They’re memories that float outside themselves. We were in a community hall, a buffet at one end and stage at the other, and in between the two was the party with its bored dogs and drinking men and children feral on Coke, then, as it got dark, my friend started singing. I had the oddest feeling. As if we had always been here. As if all houses were haunted houses, as if something froze in us during those lockdown years, as if time was unstable. Mostly, I felt grateful. To be there. It took a pandemic for me to truly appreciate the strength of thread that connects us to our pasts, and the joy of standing in a room while those little histories dance clumsily around you. Mr Tenney is certain most of the ghost reports he receives are “completely explainable”. “When the sun comes up and the house starts to warm up, [people are] usually at work – they’re not used to hearing the bricks pop and the wood expand,” he said. “It’s not that the house wasn’t making those sounds. They just never had the time to notice it.” Email Eva at e.wiseman@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter @EvaWiseman",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Parties, pandemics and the paranormal | Eva Wiseman",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/20/parties-pandemics-and-the-paranormal
2/20/2022,"After four and a half years of waiting, Leanne* and her three children recently found out that they can move from the two-bedroom council flat they have outgrown into a house. It’s welcome news, but there is a problem, she says: “There are no curtains, no carpet, no nothing: I don’t know where to start.” Leanne, who works part-time as a dinner lady and claims universal credit, is not alone in her struggle to afford basic household items.  There are no official figures for the number of people living in furniture poverty, but research done before the pandemic by the charity Turn2us suggested 4.8 million were without at least one essential household appliance such as a cooker or a fridge, and the problem is getting worse. “Somewhere for them all to sleep is the main priority,” Leanne says. Her teenage twins share a room and the bottom bunk is broken, leaving her son sleeping on a mattress. She sleeps in the boxroom with her two-year-old, who is still in a cot. There is other furniture to buy, too, and carpets. The twins share a wardrobe and when they are in separate rooms they will need one each. Leanne’s chest of drawers is currently in the living room with the TV on it, but in the new house she will be able to have her clothes in her room. “So I’ll need to get a TV stand or brackets,” she says. “We’re over the moon that we’ve got a house. But on the other hand, we’re wondering how we’re going to furnish it when we can’t even afford a new bed for the flat.” Previously unpublished figures from Turn2us’s most recent survey, of 6,000 people in August last year, show that 8% were living without a washing machine – the equivalent of 4.5 million people nationwide. Meanwhile, 7% were living without a freezer, and similar numbers reported having no oven or fridge. Not having these basic items has all kinds of knock-on effects for people’s lives: homes are uncomfortable and cold, families are unable to prepare decent meals, and they have to pay a premium to do their laundry. While secondhand items are available, they often break quickly and are difficult to collect if, like Leanne, you don’t have a car. Local councils have typically been a source of help through Local Welfare Assistance (LWA) schemes. These offer crisis grants to people in immediate need and are typically used for fuel, food and essential white goods and furniture. However, the campaign group End Furniture Poverty has found that more than 13 million people in England live in areas with no scheme, at a time when the cost of living crisis is hitting those on low incomes. It says that over the past 10 years, the cost of furniture, furnishings and carpets has risen by 32% while household appliances are up 17%, and that Brexit is driving many of those prices even higher. Claire Donovan, head of policy, research and campaigns for End Furniture Poverty, says: “The value of benefits has gone down, wages have gone down and there are these rising costs. It was hard to begin with, and it’s becoming insurmountable now.” She adds: “With the increase to fuel bills and national insurance contributions, along with rising inflation, the need for support is urgent.” Freedom of information requests made by the group found that in July 2021, one in five local authorities in England did not offer an LWA scheme, up from one in seven the previous year. The number of applications increased by 91% in 2020-21, and the number accepted went up by 157%, but the average payout went down by £29 to £146. About a third of funds were used for furniture and appliances. The group found one in four schemes was only available as a last resort, with applicants needing to have attempted all other options first, including universal credit advances, credit unions and charities. Several local authorities said people would need to have approached friends and family for support before making an application. The group called on the government to commit to spending £485m a year on funding for three years and improve its guidance, giving a single name to the schemes and setting criteria for grants. “This will give local authorities the time and certainty to expand on existing schemes, or open new ones where those have closed,” Donovan says. Thomas Cave, policy and public affairs manager at Turn2us, says: “At a time where millions of people are facing a cost-of-living crisis, we know something like a broken washing machine, or refrigerator, can be the start of a spiral into debt and eventually extreme poverty.” He adds: “Household appliances are not luxuries – they are essentials; and without the intervention of effective LWA schemes, more people will continue to fall through the cracks of the welfare safety net.” Shaun Davies, chair of the Local Government Association’s Resources Board, says councils are doing all they can to support residents who may be struggling financially. “We agree with this report that councils need adequate, long-term government investment for a more sustainable local welfare support system, which they can use flexibly to plan ahead and help households better manage the expected impact of these increasing financial pressures,” he says. * Not her real name Collette Williams is a director at the FRC Group – a social enterprise which runs the End Furniture Poverty campaign and several other initiatives, including Bulky Bob’s Furniture World shops in Liverpool and Oldham. The organisation won a council tender to collect bulky household waste, and it repurposes unwanted furniture. “Either they’re broken, too old, or not wanted,” says Williams. “We get a lot of items daily and take them to the sorting centres and go through them.” Once in good order, they are put in the shops. Anyone can buy something, but the group has relationships with local agencies who can refer those in need of help. “We provide a voucher and they can come in and choose what they want,” she says. “We don’t want people to think they can only choose the stuff no one else wants. We want them to have the best experience they can … staff ask what they like, what colours they prefer.” Vouchers have no financial limit, and staff make sure people get everything they need, delivered. “They leave with massive relief because the home that’s empty now is going to have the things they need soon; they also walk out with their head held high.” Tara’s* 12-year-old son is currently sleeping on an Ikea mattress while she tries to find funds to buy him the bed that he needs. He had been living with his dad until moving back in with her and one of her older daughters, over Christmas. “A friend has lent us a mattress – it’s from one of those Ikea trundle beds that their child has,” says Tara. It’s better than nothing, she says, but he isn’t able to get a good night’s sleep. “He comes home from school and he’s shattered. I struggle to get him up in the morning and to eat his breakfast as he’s too knackered.” It’s not just a bed that he lacks – there’s no carpet in the room. “It’s just bare wooden floors upstairs, and brown tiles downstairs.” * Not her real name",Lifestyle/Money,Furniture poverty: the price of moving in to an empty house,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/20/furniture-poverty-the-price-of-moving-in-to-an-empty-house
2/20/2022,"We all have our own annual milestones that coax us out of horticultural hibernation, kicking off a flurry of plans for the year to come. For me, it’s taking down the Chinese New Year decorations at the start of February. Partly because it is, of course, a spring festival all about new beginnings, and partly because – like Christmas – it is so bound up in nostalgia, which I think is an intrinsic part of how we all garden. This week, I’ve been thinking about the laughter-filled warm evenings spent in my grandparents’ colourful garden back in Borneo. At this time of year we always used to gather together to watch the celebratory fireworks exploding in the dark sky as my huge, extended family amassed around dozens of plastic tables for dinner. It also got me thinking of all the amazing tropical-effect garden plants that can be started out from seed about now – even in these less warm and idyllic climes.  In the UK there is the frequent preconception that exotic-style gardening is both incredibly high maintenance and prohibitively expensive. When you consider the eye-watering price of tree ferns and some of the hardier palms, this is pretty understandable conclusion. But that doesn’t mean there are no beautiful tropical species out there that are very affordable and easy to grow from seed. I’m talking about bananas. At the top of any such list has to come the Japanese fibre banana, Musa basjoo. The plant has huge, apple-green, paddle-like leaves, and is capable of creating 6ft monsters of jungly foliage in just a few months. One of the more northerly species of banana, it will thrive even in some surprisingly cold temperatures. Being root hardy (if given a good mulch) it will survive in temperatures down to as low as -15C. It won’t give you edible fruit, but it is an absolute show-stopper for its architectural looks. Soak the hard, black seeds for 24 hours in a glass of water to spark them into growth before sowing them in a propagator of seed compost on a warm windowsill, any time from March onwards. Despite their hardiness, I would still definitely plant them in a sheltered spot to prevent their sail-like foliage from being shredded by the wind. An urban courtyard or near a high boundary wall is ideal. Aside from costing a fraction of the price of buying ready-grown small plants, bananas grown from seed also give you the opportunity to try out all sorts of more niche varieties that may turn out to be similarly hardy. The classics are Musa sikkimensis from the highlands of India, with its gorgeous wine-coloured undersides and tiger stripes over the upper surface; and if you have a very sheltered spot in one of the mildest areas of the country, such as Cornwall or central London, Musa balbisiana is sometimes recommended. I currently have some Ensete glaucum, or snow banana, on the go as a bit of a gamble, and am very curious to try out Musa ‘Helen’s Hybrid’, which some claim is the hardiest edible species. I am so excited to see what they do in the year to come. Here’s to new horticultural beginnings.

2/20/2022,"Lobbyists representing fossil fuel giants are quietly helping run parliamentary groups on energy and climate policy without the need to formally declare their involvement. The trade associations, which are funded by oil and gas producers including Shell, BP and ExxonMobil, provide administrative and public relations support to groups of MPs.  Their roles are not included in official parliamentary transparency logs because of rules that say only benefits in kind above £1,500 a year must be recorded – a threshold the trade bodies say they do not meet. In one case, the UK Petroleum Industry Association (UKPIA) – an alliance of eight of the world’s biggest oil companies – is playing a key role in the running of the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on downstream energy and fuels. The association’s involvement is not listed as a benefit, and the names of the firms it represents do not appear in official parliamentary records. But it has helped arrange and chair meetings for the APPG and is listed as the public inquiry point, meaning people getting in touch about parliamentary business may first encounter an oil-industry PR representative. The association’s members have also had access to MPs. In a meeting of the APPG in June – which the trade body jointly chaired – MPs were given keynote presentations by two of its members, the oil giants BP and Phillips 66. The UKPIA said the APPG was “set up in accordance with relevant guidance” to consider the role the sector could “play in meeting government net zero goals” and that its “limited activities” meant the value of its services did not meet the £1,500 threshold. Another trade body, Oil & Gas UK, recently rebranded as Offshore Energies UK, is listed as the inquiry point for the British offshore oil and gas industry APPG. The association – which states that its primary goal is to ensure the North Sea “remains an attractive place to do business” – coordinates meetings, distributes invites and prepares minutes for the APPG but says the total value of its services is less than £100. Its link to the group has given it access to the heart of Westminster. In 2020 a reception for the APPG was held on the House of Commons Terrace Pavilion “on behalf of” Oil & Gas UK, according to hospitality logs. A spokesman said: “Offshore Energies UK acts as the secretariat for the APPG but recent costs have been minimal. The cost in the last reporting year, for February 2021, fell below £100.” Some MPs in the groups are among the most vocal advocates for policies that benefit oil and gas producers, including calling for greater investment in the sector and opposing the recently proposed windfall tax, which would see the industry pay about £3bn extra in corporation tax. While there is no suggestion of impropriety, the findings have raised concerns about the possibility of APPGs being used to influence policymakers. Professor Elizabeth David-Barrett, director of the Centre for the Study of Corruption at the University of Sussex, said the undeclared arrangements could allow external groups to “distort policy without the public knowing”. She said it was problematic that industry representatives were contact points. “You might think you’re writing to the APPG … but actually the person has a particular advocacy agenda,” she added. Others said it was surprising that the minimum threshold for declaring services had not been met. In many cases, where outside organisations handle the administration of an APPG, this is registered as a benefit and appears in the official register of APPGs. The entry for the APPG on autism, for example, listed secretariat services provided by the National Autistic Society, a charity, as being worth up to £18,000 per year, while Macmillan, the secretariat for the APPG on cancer, said the annual value of its service equated to a £25,000-£27,000 benefit in kind. But for the energy-related APPGs identified in the Observer analysis, no benefits are listed. The office of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards said groups can appoint “whoever they wish” as their public inquiry point and that only benefits worth more than £1,500 must be included on the register. Groups receiving more than £12,500 in benefits over the year must complete an income and expenditure statement listing all benefits above £100. The APPG on downstream energy and fuels says its total benefits do not meet this threshold, so has not completed a statement. The British offshore oil and gas Industry APPG has completed a statement, but says Oil & Gas UK’s services amount to less than £100, so do not need to be included. Dylan Tanner, executive director of InfluenceMap, a thinktank tracking lobbying by polluting industries, said the value of the administrative services being provided was “tiny compared to what’s at stake”. “The focus shouldn’t be on the money,” he said. The findings follow a series of revelations about lobbying by the fossil fuel industry. In October, the Guardian revealed that the Conservative party and its MPs had registered £1.3m in legally declared gifts and donations from climate sceptics and fossil fuel interests since the 2019 election. They also add fuel to concerns about APPGs, which can provide a valuable forum for charities, campaign groups and companies to contribute to discussions, but are seen by some as a backdoor route to policymakers that can be easily exploited. Companies often make direct payments or donate gifts to the groups to help with their running. Rose Whiffen, research officer at Transparency International UK, said a danger could arise when APPGs became “too closely aligned with private interests”. “Without reform, they will remain a backdoor for undue influence in Westminster,” she said.",News/Politics,Oil and gas firms have unlisted links to Westminster,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/20/lobbyists-for-oil-and-gas-companies-shell-bp-exxonmobil
2/20/2022,"Opening the Gotham hotel press conference for Monsieur Verdoux in 1947, Charlie Chaplin (1889-1977) told journalists to “proceed with the butchery”. I’d read that comment before, but in this expansive documentary the original audiotape is dramatised in the verbatim theatre style of Clio Barnard’s The Arbor, enabling us to see and hear it – sort of. As with their wonderful previous work Notes on Blindness (2016), co-directors James Spinney and Peter Middleton make adventurous use of lip-synced recreations, bringing old audio recordings to new cinematic life as they wrestle with the contradictory spectre of one of cinema’s true pioneers. It’s a technique that proves particularly powerful when applied to the tape-recorded recollections of Effie Wisdom, a childhood friend of Chaplin’s who was interviewed by Kevin Brownlow in the early 80s, and who is here embodied on screen by Anne Rosenfeld. There’s something genuinely uncanny about the result, as if the film were conjuring ghosts to retell their stories – a feeling brought full circle thanks to a late-life meeting between the pair (“I said: ‘Well, Charlie, we’re all getting on, darling, aren’t we?’”). Affecting too is a wide-ranging interview Chaplin gave for Life magazine in 1966 – recorded for the page but here leaping from the screen.  From childhood poverty to adult stardom, obscurity to fame and then infamy, Chaplin’s story was always the stuff of legend. Yet unlike Richard Attenborough’s stodgy 1992 biographical drama, Chaplin, this documentary provides a gripping, clear-eyed overview of his life and works. When comparisons are made between real life and fiction (the attic room of Chaplin’s boyhood is juxtaposed with scenes from The Kid), such connections seem organic rather than contrived. An investigation of the phenomenon of Chaplin impersonators says as much about the “global village” aspect of moving pictures as it does about Chaplin’s own fame, with this magical new medium allowing the formerly theatre-bound Karno clown to appear in many locations at the same time. Admittedly, Chaplin aficionados will find little that is new, and may be frustrated by the concertina-ing of his early work at Keystone, Essanay and Mutual. Things change in the United Artists era, particularly during an extended discussion of a scene from City Lights. Here, the complex process of constructing an apparently simple gag is vividly brought to life, with Pearl Mackie’s low-key narration astutely highlighting the irony of a silent film pivoting upon a car-door slam. Chaplin’s co-star in City Lights was Virginia Cherrill, and their onscreen chemistry prompted speculation about real-life romance. Cherrill later commented that, at the age of 20, she was much too old for Chaplin, an observation that leads this documentary into well-rehearsed but still shocking accounts of his several marriages to (and affairs with) very young women. Much is made of how these women were silenced by Chaplin (his autobiography never even names the second of three teenage brides, Lita Grey) and exploited by his enemies (Hedda Hopper and the FBI both leapt on Joan Barry’s paternity suit), becoming little more than footnotes in the life of a troublesome “genius”. By a strange twist of fate, the one woman with whom Chaplin had a lengthy, stable relationship – his fourth wife, the actor Oona O’Neill – apparently left almost no recordings of her voice, leading her daughter to note forlornly that “my mother’s voice doesn’t exist”. Marriages and divorces not only made headlines but also fuelled the anti-communist witch-hunts that drove the creator of the anti-fascist masterpiece The Great Dictator out of America. While Being the Ricardos is shaping up as leading Oscar contender, the red-scare tribulations recounted here are altogether more horrifying. “Who is the real Charlie Chaplin?” asks the documentary, and the answer is: “Who knows?” Like the Little Tramp alter ego he constructed from absurdly contradictory castoffs (Ford Sterling’s size 14 shoes, Fatty Arbuckle’s giant trousers, Chester Conklin’s tight coat, Mack Swain’s cut-down moustache), he was the long and the short and the tall, all at once. In the words of writer Max Eastman: “Enjoy any Charlie Chaplin you have the good luck to encounter, but don’t try to link them up… There are too many of them.”",Arts/Film,The Real Charlie Chaplin review – a gripping study of a complex superstar,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/20/the-real-charlie-chaplin-review-documentary-peter-middleton-james-spinney
2/20/2022,"Mary Barker’s life as she knew it came to an end when fraudsters stole £70,000 from her pension pot. On her retirement, she thought she had invested the money in a bond from a well-known financial firm. However, criminals had cloned its website and paperwork and duped her into transferring half of her savings to a private bank account. Her bank refused to refund her, claiming she had been negligent. The scam has left her in financial straits but far worse has been the emotional impact. She told Guardian Money: “I get so depressed at times, I don’t know how I can carry on. I’m dreading the future.”  Online fraud has almost doubled during the coronavirus pandemic, with more than £750m lost to scammers during the first half of 2021. According to a report by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services, it can have “permanent and life-changing consequences” for those affected. Yet, it concludes: “Fraud continues to be treated as a low-priority crime, a victimless crime, or a crime that doesn’t cause the harm recognised in other types of crime.” The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, was criticised earlier this month for appearing to dismiss the impact of soaring financial fraud. Defending Boris Johnson’s exclusion of scams when claiming falling crime rates, he spoke of “crime that people experience in their day-to-day lives … in terms of burglary, in terms of physical injury, has gone down”. It provoked an angry response from victims whose lives have been wrecked. Clara Bennett, a 33-year-old NHS worker who was scammed out of her £20,000 wedding savings, says the public’s perception that victims are gullible, greedy or elderly conceals the changing nature of scams. “It allows banks to evade accountability and refund only those they perceive as not to blame,” she says. “The implication is some people are more deserving of justice than others. “I am a savvy professional and I didn’t think it would happen to me but scammers posing as my bank’s fraud department used social engineering to get me into a place of total panic. “Although things appear to be improving with regard to victim blaming in sexual abuse, it seems scams remain unchallenged and justified by the financial sector.” Fraud now makes up 42% of all crime and only one in 700 fraud cases resulted in a conviction in 2019. The effect on victims can be greater than physical theft, according to the consumer group Which?, which estimates that the hit to wellbeing last year equated to £9.3bn. The figure is based on a study of the social impacts of frauds reported through an official crime survey. Unlike burglary victims, however, many of those who have lost life-changing sums feel they are being held culpable. The sophisticated technology and psychological tactics used make it increasingly hard to distinguish a scam from a legitimate financial service. But the frequent insistence of banks that victims were negligent, and the fact that only 4% of complaints to Action Fraud are then passed on to enforcement agencies, suggest victims are being blamed. Bennett’s bank refused to refund her, claiming she should have taken more care to check the callers were genuine. It is an accusation, she says, that has had as great an effect on her as the financial loss. “It is hard to distance myself from what I think other people might think about me, and how the responses from the banks have made me feel,” she says. “My wedding can only go ahead thanks to the generosity of my family but the scam has caused me to question whether I deserve a wedding party, or whether I should just cancel the whole thing, as a sort of ‘punishment’ for what has happened.” Edward Schwarz, 95, considers himself an experienced investor but he was caught out by fraudsters impersonating Goldman Sachs. They stole £85,000 of his pension fund in a sophisticated sting. His bank has refused to refund him because he did not check the Financial Conduct Authority’s list of cloned firms before transferring the money. “I no longer like to leave the house,” he says. “I already struggle to walk after an accident last year and the stress has made it so much worse. I could not get out of bed for some weeks afterwards.” According to Wayne Stevens, the national fraud lead at the charity Victim Support, these stories are typical. “We have supported people who have been forced to sell treasured possessions or, in extreme cases, into bankruptcy or homelessness,” he says. “Victims can struggle with their mental health, sometimes becoming too afraid to leave home or go online.” A Treasury committee report this month urged the government to increase police funding to tackle a fraud “epidemic” and to force banks to reimburse victims. Currently, they can choose to sign up to a voluntary refund scheme. The government says it was bringing forward investment of £400m over the next three years to tackle a “fraud epidemic”. Barker was eventually refunded 12 months after the scam when the Financial Ombudsman Service overruled her bank’s refusal, but the shock of the ordeal still overwhelms her. “If anyone I know found out what had happened, I would die of shame,” she says. “Regardless of the outcome, I am scarred for life.”  All names have been changed.",Lifestyle/Money,Online fraud: victim blaming and the emotional price of falling for a scam,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/20/online-victim-blaming-and-the-emotional-price-of-falling-for-a-scam
2/20/2022,"The pandemic has acted like a vast searchlight, sweeping across society, illuminating unpleasant truths that were lurking in the darkness. The potential for online misinformation to unleash a wave of cultish fanaticism, like the current anti-vax movement, long predated the pandemic. The glib libertarian tendency within sections of the Conservative party, a sentiment so often out of step with the public mood in its strident opposition to measures deployed to fight the virus, was similarly hidden in plain sight. However, the truth most bluntly uncovered by the pandemic is the scale and the depth of inequality in 21st-century Britain. Ours is among the most unequal societies in Europe and among the many axes along which inequality runs is that of race.  In the blaze of the pandemic’s searchlight, ethnic inequalities in healthcare and health outcomes have been more widely publicised than ever before. Once it became clear that people from minority groups were at greater risk of contracting and dying from Covid, a broader debate about ethnic health inequality quickly followed. Today, two years after the first lockdown, the shocking statistic that black women in England are four times more likely to die in pregnancy or childbirth than white women is now well known within the black community. Other disturbing statistics about black people’s experiences of mental health services have also been brought to broader public attention. In response, during the dark, lockdown days of 2020, the NHS established the Race and Health Observatory, an independent body tasked with researching ethnic health inequalities. The Observatory’s newly published report, built on research by the University of Manchester, in conjunction with the universities of Sheffield and Sussex, states a stark truth in the starkest terms: “Ethnic inequalities in health outcomes are evident at every stage throughout the life course, from birth to death.” It is normally the case that at publication the authors of a report stress what is new about their findings. They emphasise how their work will change the debate or challenge earlier data. The authors of this report go out of their way to stress the opposite. As they state, little of the information they have carefully collected and collated is new, much of it being drawn from the 178 earlier studies that they identify or cite. The problem is not a lack of reports; it is, as they note, “that existing evidence hasn’t led to significant change”. Among the factors that they conclude have negatively affected “the health of ethnic minority people” is “discriminatory treatment from healthcare staff”. As a result of such experiences, some from minority communities have delayed “seeking help for health problems due to fear of racist treatment”. Another reality that has become better understood over recent years is that racism is personally damaging. Discrimination hurts, it is corrosive, it wears people down and, unsurprisingly, those who have experienced it seek to avoid further exposure. They choose not to place themselves in harm’s way even if, as this report shows, that is to the detriment of their health. Talking about the NHS critically is difficult because the NHS is special, a unique and uniquely loved institution. It is held in such esteem that its failings seem to matter more than those of other institutions and the urge to praise the service can at times overwhelm the need for clear-eyed analysis. For that reason, the notion that, like other national institutions, the NHS has a problem with various forms of racism – “structural, institutional and interpersonal”, as the report categorises them – is for some difficult to accept. The demographic who will have the least difficulty coming to terms with this are people of colour who work in the NHS. In 2021, I made a documentary about the history of the service, for which we interviewed doctors and nurses who had built their NHS careers from the late 1940s. Many spoke in detail about their experiences of the racism and discrimination within the service, a subject that is also tackled within the Observatory’s report. The pandemic has further complicated the picture. For most of us, Covid has been among the most profound experiences of our lives. As the NHS became an epidemiological front line, our national affection for the service was heightened. The millions of children who in 2020 stood by their parents, as we banged pots and pans and cheered for the 1.3 million people who work in the NHS, will remember that experience for the rest of their lives. They will remember it in the same way that today’s octogenarians remember air-raid sirens and rationing. Perhaps never in its history has the NHS been more publicly praised and at the same time never have its frailties, and the health inequalities that stem from them, been better understood. Our deep respect for the NHS should not blind us for the fact that it is in need of reform. Yet to even place “NHS” and “reform” in the same sentence feels transgressive. For decades, those whose ideological mission is to carve up and privatise the service have deployed the idea of reform as political camouflage for that politically toxic project. But it must surely be possible to devise needed reforms that are very different from those that linger in the minds of the small staters and disaster-capitalists. The NHS is special but its failings are not unique. It needs reform in the same way that the Met police and the wider criminal justice system need reform. Both sectors – healthcare and policing and criminal justice – have manifestly failed minority communities and in both cases there is no shortage of data detailing the nature and consequences of those failings. The question now is whether a government that largely ignored the previous reports on which the Race and Health Observatory’s work is built will be willing to contemplate anything like the level of change shown to be necessary. Our love for the NHS cannot be unconditional. It can only truly be a national health service if it treats all the communities that make up the nation equally.

2/20/2022,"Senior Tory MPs called on Sunday for Boris Johnson to drop plans to privatise Channel 4, arguing that such a move would damage the “levelling up” agenda, and run contrary to the founding vision of Margaret Thatcher. In a strongly worded letter to the prime minister, the MPs – who include the former culture secretary Karen Bradley and ex-cabinet minister Damian Green, as well as the chair of the foreign affairs select committee Tom Tugendhat – insist that a case for privatisation has not been made and that ministers should “leave it alone”.  The signatories, who also include the former minister Stephen Hammond and two MPs from “red wall” seats – Simon Fell (Barrow and Furness) and Andy Carter (Warrington South) – write that Channel 4 is “self-sufficient and successful, making no drain on the public purse”, and plans for a change of ownership are unnecessary. They add: “Margaret Thatcher created Channel 4 as a publicly owned, non-profit public sector broadcaster that would act as an incubator for independent, risk-taking, innovative private sector companies. She had a vision to level up the broadcasting landscape and she succeeded spectacularly well. We should maintain her legacy, not put it at risk.” Their intervention comes as Johnson seeks out what he believes will be big and eye-catching “red meat” policy announcements while he seeks to head off a leadership challenge following the “partygate” scandal, which has enraged many of his MPs and Tory members. In January, with a reformist agenda in mind, the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, confirmed that the BBC licence fee would be frozen at £159 until April 2024, meaning cuts to the corporation’s budgets. Dorries said she could “not justify extra pressure on the wallets of hardworking households”. Last year, under her predecessor, Oliver Dowden, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) also announced a review of Channel 4’s structure. The channel has been under government ownership since its 1982 launch during Thatcher’s first term. But ministers now argue that disruption from streaming giants has altered the broadcasting landscape to the point where Channel 4 might benefit from private ownership. The broadcaster is also seen by some Conservatives as prone to political bias, which defenders of Channel 4 believe is driving the reform plans. In their letter to the prime minister, the MPs argue that rather than being a problem, Channel 4 is an impressive success story, one that is achieving what Thatcher had intended by helping deliver on levelling up and by encouraging entrepreneurship. They write: “It [Channel 4] is self-sufficient and successful, making no drain on the public purse. It also plays a vital role in the broadcasting ecosystem, not least in commissioning programmes from more independent production companies, and more small independent production companies, than any other public service broadcaster. Channel 4’s support for regional SMEs is unique. The channel’s support for these companies through its commissioning targets already goes far further than is required, and further than any other public service broadcaster. “It is in many ways an engine of small production company growth outside the M25, giving a platform to regional businesses, which we should be nurturing and growing. Regional voices have long struggled to break into the broadcasting landscape; Channel 4’s current ownership structure ensures more will be heard. In doing this, it plays a crucial role in supporting British businesses in one of the UK’s most internationally successful and iconic industries. To put it simply: Channel 4 isn’t broke, and doesn’t need fixing.” Since it was founded, Channel 4 has been editorially independent while being owned by the state. It receives its funding from advertising and has a remit to commission distinctive programming and deliver to diverse and under-served audiences across the UK. Unlike other broadcasters, Channel 4 is also required to reinvest its profits in new shows, funnelling cash to the independent production companies that make all its programmes. The MPs suggest that ministers are considering reform without having identified a public interest for doing so.“The government does rightly recognise the unique contribution Channel 4 makes to our broadcasting and cultural sector,” they say. “It has suggested that it may place certain conditions on the sale of Channel 4: on commissioning a certain amount of its programming from independents, on a commitment to levelling up through regional commissioning and retaining its new Leeds headquarters, and on demonstrating innovation and distinctive character in its programming. This is all well and good, but all of it relates to things which Channel 4 already does and which its commercial and PSB competitors do not do, or do not do to the same extent. An easier solution exists: leave it alone.” Channel 4 has to meet what is called a nations and regions quota, requiring it to commission at least 35% of its first-run content, in terms of both hours and spend, outside the M25. ITV has the same quota, but unlike ITV, Channel 4 has made a voluntary contribution to increase this to 50% by 2023, which it is on course to meet: up to £250m additional investment in the nations and regions compared with what is legally required. A DCMS spokesperson said: “We value Channel 4’s contribution to levelling up and are clear its public service broadcasting remit and our commitment to independent regional productions would continue following any potential sale. “There is a wealth of evidence on the challenges for linear TV broadcasters, and it is right we consider a change in ownership to support Channel 4’s long-term sustainability. This could allow more and quicker investment in creative content and platforms to support the wider creative industries.”",News/Media,"‘Channel 4 isn’t broke, don’t fix it’: MPs launch bid to stop sell-off",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/20/channel-4-isnt-broke-dont-fix-it-mps-launch-bid-to-stop-sell-0ff
