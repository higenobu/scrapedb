3/7/2022,"One month ago, Boris Johnson’s premiership seemed to be in peril. “Coming into work felt like going to a funeral every day,” one No 10 aide recalled. “You could feel the guilt in the building from people who thought ‘we’ve let him down’.” Faced with a trickle of Tory MPs openly calling for the prime minister to quit and a police investigation into lockdown parties, the politician who had always managed to wriggle free appeared this time to have no way out. But after scrapping some of his top Downing Street advisers, charting a course to restore discipline in the party by overhauling the whips’ office in a mini reshuffle and with the respite of the indefinitely delayed Sue Gray report, Johnson has clung on. More than that, though, he has won round some naysayers and sought to present himself as a Churchillian leader, given the war in Ukraine. Tory MPs who previously privately briefed against him now rally to his defence. One declared him “a true hero in a crisis”. Another said: “Anyone making a move against him would not be in the spirit of the times.” Barely a day passes where Johnson is not pictured meeting troops, foreign diplomats and leaders, constantly claiming that the UK is leading the international response to Russian aggression. The headlines about Russia’s nuclear posturing, bombing of civilian buildings and the ensuing humanitarian crisis are drawing constant attention, meaning the momentum that was building for Johnson to quit has subsided quickly. Another previously critical Tory MP confessed: “At the moment, it’s certainly working in our party’s favour.” The arrival in Downing Street of David Canzini, an aide well respected among Tory MPs, has been viewed as a vote of confidence in Johnson. Some members of the “pork pie plot” were spotted having dinner in one of the parliamentary restaurants at the start of the week. The public nature of their gathering was looked upon by government whips as a sign the private plotting had ceased. “We missed our shot,” sighed one Tory backbencher. “I’ve gone about as far out on a limb as I can to get rid of him. The only person that can bring Boris down is Boris.” Another admitted it was fanciful to think they could get 181 colleagues to vote against Johnson, even if they did somehow manage to get the 54 letters needed to trigger a confidence vote, should Johnson be fined by police. The war has also placed an intense spotlight on the two ministers widely believed to be frontrunners in a Tory leadership race: the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the foreign secretary, Liz Truss. The response to Russian aggression has caused some to accuse the pair of not being quick or tough enough to respond with sanctions. A Whitehall insider said: “We keep saying we’re world-leading in this space, but we’re not any more.” Some doubt that Johnson was ever even in real danger, considering he sustained no ministerial resignations – unlike Theresa May did in the run up to her departure. But only one person who submitted a letter of no confidence in the prime minister has said they have withdrawn it, suggesting Johnson is not out of the woods completely. “Especially at times of international crisis, it’s essential for leaders to be honest and have integrity,” a senior Tory MP said. “Until we hear from the Met and see Sue Gray’s full report, the jury is still out.” Another said: “The fundamentals haven’t changed – that we can’t trust him and we don’t know what scandal is coming next.” A former Tory No 10 adviser also warned Johnson was “on borrowed time” and “simply doesn’t have any room for mistakes or further embarrassment”. There is also a danger point approaching: April’s local elections. Given Labour’s lead in every national opinion poll since 8 December, a minister said they were “extremely nervous” about the Conservatives’ performance and that it was hard to see Johnson surviving if the party’s flagship Wandsworth council was lost. Part of the reason Johnson appears safe for now is that the initial campaign to oust him was poorly organised. With MPs’ attention focused on Ukraine, there is even less coordination to keep up the pressure on him.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson has fended off a leadership challenge … for now,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/06/boris-johnson-has-fended-off-a-leadership-challenge-for-now
3/7/2022,"The Home Office has agreed to pay nearly £6,000 in a settlement to an EU citizen it detained at the border in a post-Brexit crack down on Europeans entering the country last year. Miro Matos, a Slovakian who has lived in the UK for 18 years, was so furious at his treatment in Calais that he sued after officials detained him for 10 hours alleging he was using a false name and had not declared a driving offence when he applied for EU settled status. “I thought: ‘Have they lost their minds?’ I didn’t come in on a floating door. I drive in a car. I understand when there is human error but every single thing they said about me was rubbish,” he said. “I have travelled the world, but this is the rudest approach I have ever experienced,” he said. When he applied to see the notes of the border official in preparation for a complaint he was shocked to see that officials wrote that he had tried to “smuggle someone in”. In a pre-action response in November, the Home Office confirmed its records should also have shown he was entitled to be in the country – not only had he settled status but three months earlier the Home Office had approved his application to become a British citizen, inviting him to a naturalisation ceremony 10 days after his detention. Correspondence from the Home Office after his complaint acknowledged “that detention was unwarranted in light of your status to reside in the UK. Your status should have been known to the persons on staff at the time of your detention.” It agreed that “compensation” was “appropriate” and initially made an offer of £2,000, but in the last week it agreed a settlement of £5,750. But he declined the offer after a complaint in which he said “it is quite difficult to stand up to against a firm that uses lies as a working tool”. He also said it was important to get the detention record scrubbed so he would not face detention every time he came home after travelling. Matos’s nightmare began at 6.40pm one evening last May when he was returning home after a visit to his Covid-vulnerable mother in Slovakia. He was detained along with a Brazilian friend who was returning to London to collect his luggage before flying back to Rio de Janeiro. Officials confiscated their phones, took their luggage and despite many requests did not tell Matos what was going on until 3.30am the following morning. Matos, 42, who is the general manager at a restaurant in Chancery Lane in London, said he understands that border officials have to check documents but had not expected such hostility. “I knew I had done nothing wrong,” he said. “But no matter how many times I asked them what was going on they wouldn’t say. They put us a backroom with a little mat and a blanket. They offered us a mask. “Our phones were taken away. Our luggage. I said you can go and open the car, look at everything, but I just want someone to talk to me and explain what was wrong. “Nobody came until about 3.30am in the morning when they started asking me random questions. When they asked me about an alias, I said: ‘What are you talking about? I have never used another name in my life.’” It transpired that the Home Office had a misspelled version of his name, Matios, instead of Matos. He said he was “not proud” of the driving offence, which happened 16 years ago and was in any case legally spent, and claimed border officials said they could rescind his settled status. After completing a subject access request to obtain Home Office records, he was pleased to be reminded that he had declared the offence on his application for settled status. “I can understand that they have to check things but the normal approach is: ‘This is what we think, tell us your side of the story, let’s get the facts,’ but in Calais this woman was just trying to write a report which she wanted to write rather than the facts she heard,” he said. The Home Office has been approached for comment.",News/Politics,"Home Office to pay UK resident £5,750 for 10-hour Calais detention",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/06/uk-resident-slovakian-calais-detention-home-office-misspelled-name-slugs
3/7/2022,"MPs are urging major banks to shut their Moscow offices, after campaigners accused them of “quietly profiting” off their Russian operations while other industries sever ties with the country. Some of the City’s largest lenders including JP Morgan, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and Credit Suisse collectively employ thousands of staff who offer banking services to large companies and wealthy clients doing business in Russia. While banks have had to drop services for Russian businesses and oligarchs in line with EU, US and UK sanctions, MPs said lenders had a moral duty to exit the country to put further financial pressure on Moscow as the Russian military continues to assault Ukraine. “It’s not particularly shocking to see that major City or European banks have a presence in Russia,” the senior Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge said. “But what is shocking that we have not heard from the banks what they plan to do about it.” A number of companies have pulled their operations and services in Russia since its invasion of Ukraine. These include: Retailers Travel Carmakers Drinks industry Tech, media and entertainment Luxury goods companies Manufacturing  She said she recognised that financial institutions already had a “major role to play” in enforcing sanctions that are meant to cripple the Russian economy and force President Vladimir Putin to withdraw troops from Ukraine. However, Hodge said banks should go further. “While they may not have to leave Russia yet according to the law, there is a moral dimension to this and I fully expect that these banks will do the right thing and start severing ties with Russia and the Russian economy.” The comments will put further pressure on lenders to review their Russian footprint, regardless of the size of their local operations. London-headquartered bank HSBC has around 200 staff in the country, while Wall Street lenders JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs have 160 and 80 local employees, respectively. Swiss bank Credit Suisse has 100 local staff, offering wealth management, investment banking and support services, while Deutsche Bank has approximately 1,700 employees in Russia. The French lender Société Générale employs about 12,000 staff in the country through its Rosbank subsidiary, which offers retail banking, private banking for wealthy clients, and investment banking services. US bank Citi refused to confirm staff numbers but its website says it has more than 500,000 retail customers and 3,000 corporate clients in Russia, with operations in 11 cities across the country. The Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson, Layla Moran, joined Hodge in calling for a full withdrawal of international banks from Russia. “For too long, too many western companies have bent over backwards to help facilitate the Kremlin’s oppression, Putin’s war chest and the lifestyle of his oligarchs,” the MP added. “It’s time to cut Putin’s regime off for good. Western banks must pull out of Russia without delay.” It comes as a string of consultancy groups start to rein in their Russian operations, including Accenture, which confirmed it was shutting down its 2,300-strong office as part of opposition to the Russian military’s assault on Ukraine. Oil majors including Shell and BP have also pledged to exit joint ventures and offload their stakes in state energy firms in reaction to the conflict. Becky Jarvis, a representative of the Bank on our Future campaign group, said it was “unconscionable that the west’s biggest banks have been quietly profiting off banking services in Russia, while even the fossil fuel majors, BP and Shell, have withdrawn their investments.” BankTrack, another campaign group that monitors the financial sector has also called for a “complete withdrawal” by international banks, saying it was likely to be the “best option to avoid contributing to the harms of this invasion”. “However, banks need to put the safety of their workers and their families first,” BankTrack added. “This includes doing everything they can to ensure workers don’t face retaliatory action for joining demonstrations, for example, and making sure they consider the wider human rights impacts of any moves to disengage.” All the banks mentioned in this article were contacted. Most declined to comment, but said they complied with international rules including sanctions. Deutsche Bank added that most of its clients were “European or multinational corporates who are currently adapting their business activities in the country. We are monitoring the situation closely and may adapt our approach as appropriate. We have reduced our exposure to Russia significantly over recent years and the risks are well contained.”",News/Business,British MPs urge global banks to close Russian offices ‘without delay’,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/06/campaigners-british-mps-banks-moral-duty-exit-russia-moscow-offices-hsbc-jp-morgan-deutsche-bank
3/7/2022,"Arsenal opened up an eight-point gap between themselves and their nearest title contenders Chelsea with a deserved 4-2 win over Birmingham. Though the hosts conceded two late goals, they remained potent in their attack throughout thanks to the defence-dismantling duo of Vivianne Miedema and Stina Blackstenius. All eyes will now be trained on Emma Hayes’ Chelsea, who must win their three games in hand to match the pace of the current league leaders and their new-look attack. Blackstenius, signed in the January transfer window, led the line in a fashionable 3-4-3, while Miedema operated from a deeper position, haunting the midfield half-spaces. Every time Birmingham sought to leave the confines of their defensive third, it was the marauding Arsenal full-backs that fed the pair, forcing the visitors to punt long to an isolated Libby Smith. It was only a matter of time before that particular ploy would lead to a goal, and it all unfolded in the 13th minute with a swashbuckling run from Steph Catley down the Arsenal right. The full-back may have been frustrated when her shot was deflected onto the crossbar and not past Marie Hourihane’s reach, but the disappointment would be short-lived when the resulting corner, delivered expertly by Laura Wienroither, was headed in by Rafaelle Souza. Arsenal doubled down with their high-pressing system, forcing possession to be turned over again. This time it was Blackstenius leading the charge, with the ball ricocheting around in the penalty box. In strode Miedema, calm and composed amidst the defensive scramble to slot the loose ball away with ease to score Arsenal’s second in the 33rd minute. The Arsenal manager, Jonas Eidevall, had this to say on Miedema’s current form: “Viv enjoys feeling involved and connected and in this new pressing role she is doing that, it’s the same in offence, I think she is happy and she’s enjoying herself”. Arsenal continued to enjoy themselves collectively in the second half while Birmingham became increasingly more reliant upon their hardworking defence. The hold-out lasted until 20 minutes from time before Beth Mead delivered what looked the killer blow – a third goal thanks to her own darting run towards Hourihane’s goal, facilitated by Catley’s inch-perfect pass through the cracks of the Birmingham central defence. Consolation for Birmingham’s overworked back four came finally in the form of a goal scored by Smith from the restart. Lucy Quinn then followed up in the 83rd minute to ignite some concern among the home crowd. Birmingham’s manager, Darren Carter, said: “The response to going two down was fantastic, to fight back to 3-2 and potentially score an equaliser, I’m proud of my players”. Foord, however, provided relief for the hosts to make it 4-2 in the dying moments of the game, ensuring the three points stayed with them.

3/7/2022,"Witch trials, with their heady mix of religious fervour, misogyny and repressed desire, have held an enduring fascination for fiction writers. Rosie Andrews’s enormously enjoyable debut, The Leviathan, takes this familiar setup and makes of it something strange and original: part horror story, part fantasy, part historical mystery. The body of the story takes place in 1643, at the onset of the English civil war. The narrator, Thomas Treadwater, a young man enlisted to fight for the parliamentary forces in order to redeem himself from an indiscretion with his tutor’s niece, returns for Christmas to his family farm in Norfolk with a sense of foreboding; his 16-year-old sister, Esther, has written to him of “a great ungodly evil” that has entered the house in the form of a new servant, Chrissa Moore. Tom arrives to find all their livestock dead, his father incapacitated by a stroke and Chrissa arrested for witchcraft. In order to delay her trial, she has claimed to be pregnant with his father’s child. Tom does not believe in witchcraft, but when the two servants accused along with Chrissa are found dead in the next cell, he is forced to accept that sinister forces may be at work. The reader is ahead of him here, because the story is intercut with chapters set 60 years later, recounted by Tom as an old man, living in terror of the woman locked up in his attic. The clue is in the title, of course, though to say more would be to give away the story’s unexpected twists. Young Tom is obliged to seek help from the one person who can shed light on the mystery – his former tutor, who happens to be John Milton, a man well versed in dissecting the nature of good and evil. Andrews writes with a finely attuned ear for the language of the period. Though the complex politics of the early civil war remain largely in the background, she clearly knows the history well, and confidently evokes the atmosphere of the age: the sense of turbulence that comes with living through a time of revolution.

3/7/2022,"When I hopped on a train from Krakow to Przemyśl, a small Polish town near the Ukrainian border, I expected to be confronted with a humanitarian catastrophe, produced by a million people fleeing their homes due to war. But what I saw was instead the best of humanity. As Russia has launched a bloody full-scale war against my country, thousands of Ukrainians have escaped by train to this railway station. There, they are met by an enormous banner in front of its entrance that reads, in bothPolish and Ukrainian: “You are safe here.” Inside, dozens of Polish volunteers provide Ukrainian refugees with “everything for free”, as another sign says – food, water, clothes, phones with prepaid plans, accommodation, legal advice. While I was there, the volunteers mingled among the crowds, helping displaced Ukrainians find food, hot beverages and somewhere to sit. Little islands of people surrounded power extensions, clinging to their phones for news and texts from loved ones who were still in Ukraine. “I’ve never seen anything like this,” said one Ukrainian woman in her sixties, bursting into tears. “I was crying from how they met us. Everything was very well organised at every step. We were told where to go, what to do. I was shocked that they even carried our luggage. It is so touching.” More than 1.5 million people have fled Ukraine in just 10 days, with about 1 million of them crossing into Poland. No specific funding legislation has been passed yet in response to the effort, but local government in the Polish Podkarpackie region, which covers about half of the Ukrainian-Polish border, has spent more than €10m to date. Meanwhile, the European Commission has said it will allow EU states to use resources from a large Covid-19 recovery package to help Ukrainian refugees. On Wednesday the UN launched a $1.7bn appeal to provide assistance both in Ukraine and in the countries welcoming Ukrainian refugees, while the UNHCR is also present, helping to register and provide accommodation for refugees at the Polish border. Yet it’s the response of ordinary Polish people that has been most astounding – with more than 90% of Poles in a recent survey supporting the admission of Ukrainian refugees into Poland, and 65% saying they are willing to help them personally. At the station, about 20 people stood in a line for free sim cards. One of them, Viktoria, 30, had escaped from Kharkiv – Ukraine’s second largest city, in the country’s east. To reach the train station there safely, she told me, she had walked through the city’s underground metro tunnels. She escaped alone and had to leave behind her mother, too elderly to travel. “My stomach hurts so bad,” Viktoria told me, her voice cut with exhaustion. “We drank water from fountains in the metro, now everyone has stomach pains, so maybe we caught something.” As a Ukrainian, I felt many emotions at the scenes in front of me. There was shock at the sight of dozens of children playing with toys on the floor as their mothers tried to collect their belongings and their thoughts, figuring out what to do next in a foreign country. Then there was guilt – I came to Poland from France, where I studied, while my mother was hiding from missiles near Kyiv. Still, my suffering could not be compared to that of the refugees I saw in Przemyśl. Most importantly, I was surprised by the generosity of Poles themselves. Since the war began, thousands have gone above and beyond to help in any possible way – hosting Ukrainians in their apartments, driving them to places, or simply giving them money to cover basic needs. Restaurants and stores around the country give Ukrainians discounts, while any services – including the train I took – are provided for free. “I myself was amazed at the amount of support,” said Nazar, a 30-year-old Ukrainian who has lived in Poland for nine years. He now spends all his time volunteering and helping Ukrainian refugees resettle in Poland. He thinks one of the reasons for Polish generosity is pragmatic: Vladimir Putin may well not stop at Ukraine. “If we don’t help Ukraine defend itself, Poland is Russia’s next neighbour. Poles understand very well that this is about their security too,” Nazar said. A number of factors may explain Poland’s generous response to Ukraine’s refugees. In the last few years a number have migrated to Poland and resettled, so Ukrainians are seen not as strangers but friends. Of course, there is the simple fact of geography – be it Turkey, hosting 3 million Syrian refugees, or Lebanon welcoming over a million, the Polish government has little choice but to adapt to the challenge. Up until Thursday, Hungary has welcomed about 140,000 people; Moldova, 97,000; Romania, 51,000; and Slovakia, 72,000. More than 100,000 still went further on to European countries that don’t share a border with Ukraine. Undoubtedly, Poland will have to bear the brunt of refugee resettlement – when a humanitarian crisis is on your doorstep, there’s little time for discussion; the instinct to help instead kicks in. Sadly, not all Poles have been as generous and there have been reports of far-right violence against non-white refugees, chanting “go back to your country”. According to reports, three Indians were beaten up, leaving one of them having to be taken to hospital. But this should not be seen as representative of Poland’s response, and the compassion they have shown my fellow country people. As I moved from one room to another at Przemyśl station, I stopped to chat to a woman who was visibly distressed. She refused to speak on the record. Her son, who looked about seven, turned to me, however, and asked: “Has the war ended?” I felt as if I had been punched in the stomach. “It will, very soon,” I told him, gently, as if there was anything else I could have possibly said. “Very soon, we will all be home.” The little boy seemed, in that moment, to believe me.

3/7/2022,"Saturday Night Live opens on Fox News’s Ukrainian Invasion Celebration Spectacular, hosted by Tucker Carlson (Alex Moffat) and Laura Ingraham (Kate McKinnon), both of whom recently got a lot of heat for their pro-Russian punditry. Carlson kept asking “Why do we hate Putin? Aren’t liberals in America worse?” while Ingraham called the Ukrainian president “pathetic”. Raising funds for Russian oligarchs impacted by the west’s sanctions, the duo introduce a number of special guests, including former President Donald Trump (James Austin Johnson), who mans the phone lines, ranting to a dial tone about Rhianna, whales, bread, beyond burgers, and “reboot of Fresh Prince”; as well as naturalized Russian citizen and “puffiest action star in the world” Steven Seagal (Bowen Yang) and “America’s first couple” Kimberly Guilfoyle (Cecily Strong) and Donald Trump Jr (Mikey Day). The latter duo perform a Russian-themed version of Lady Gaga’s Shallow, before Trump Sr sends everyone home with a rendition of Sinatra’s My Funny Valentine dedicated to Vladimir Putin. As a satirical commentary on the war in Ukraine and American conservatives’ collusion with Putin, the sketch leaves a lot – everything, in fact – to be desired, while the impersonations prove a mixed bag: Moffat does a very good Tucker Carlson, Johnson’s Trump continues to impress and the show’s depiction of Don Jr as a pathetic cokehead is a vast improvement over its former presentation of him as the smarmy brains of the family; but McKinnon’s Ingraham and Bowen’s Seagal are utterly bland and immediately forgettable. Actor Oscar Isaac hosts for the first time. The “ethnically ambiguous” star – real name Oscar Isaac Hernández Estrada (“I said to Hollywood, you can pick two of these names. Guess what they went with? The white ones”) – is excited to join the Marvel Cinematic Universe with his upcoming series Moon Knight. This leads him to reminisce about his very first film, The Avenger – not Marvel’s The Avengers, but a surprisingly bloody home movie he and his buddy shot in their backyards when they were 10 years old. We get to watch clips of the young Isaac practicing Kung Fu, violently dispatching his masked nemesis and licking blood off a prop sword, a scene he recreates on the studio 8H stage. In his first sketch, Isaac plays a politician attempting to recall the mayor of Adventure Bay, the fictional city that the popular kids’ show Paw Patrol is set in. Using testimony from concerned citizens and 9-11 recordings, he blasts the mayor’s Paw Patrol initiative, which “fired all of our city’s police officers, fire fighters and paramedics and replaced them with a group of six talking dogs”. It’s a chuckle-worthy, but also one-note premise, although Isaac’s bizarre accent and intentionally stunted delivery, along with a good last minute reveal about his relationship to the mayor, keeps things entertaining. Next, Chloe Fineman finds inspiration in the Netflix series Inventing Anna. Adopting the high fashion sense, ambiguous European accent and icy confidence of convicted con artist Anna Delvey, she runs up an expense on a poor page’s dime, berates her coworkers, and steals high-profile roles – including President Biden from Austin and Weekend Update hosting duties – for herself. However popular Inventing Anna is, it’s hardly a pop cultural phenomenon, so I’d bet that a large number of viewers were probably left completely cold by this very specific parody. Isaac and Strong play the world’s worst HR representatives, holding an annual harassment seminar at a pharmaceutical company. They test the staff on the appropriateness of blatantly offensive scenarios (one example sees an employee ask their coworker, “Hey N-word, are you going to the gym later? Or am I gonna have to drag your thick ass there myself?”) and aggressively detailing their own sexual relationship – the words “raw intercourse” get thrown around a lot – before revealing that they’re not actually HR representatives, but performers from a performance group called It Could Be Worse. There are a few laughs throughout, but it’s all very convoluted, especially an unnecessary stinger that reveals the whole scene is from a workplace sitcom. A hot date between a new couple (Sarah Sherman and Chris Redd) takes a turn for the bizarre when Redd’s character asks Sherman’s why she always wears a green ribbon around her neck. After begging him not to let it change the way he sees her, she removes the ribbon to reveal a singing and dancing “little meatball guy” growing out the side of her neck. Redd is initially cool with the deformity, until she reveals she has musical meatballs growing all over her body. Together, they harmonize and perform a trippy little ditty and, with the help of musical guest Charli XCX, a sad piano ballad. Those familiar with Sherman prior to her time on SNL know that she made a name for herself performing surreal, body horror comedy. This sketch isn’t as disturbing as her earlier work, but it’s still good to see Sherman letting her freak flag fly. On Weekend Update, the hosts discuss the war in Ukraine and its ramifications on American politics, with Colin Jost describing Senator Lindsey Graham’s suggestion that Russian citizens should assassinate Vladimir Putin as “a shocking, disgusting example of Lindsey Graham kind of being right about something”. Jost then welcomes McKinnon to the desk to comment on the Texas senate’s passing of the horrendous Don’t Say Gay Bill. Assuming the bill bans the use of the word gay as pejorative in schools, she’s initially in favor of it. But when Jost informs her that it actually bans “acknowledging gay at all,” she tries to make sense of the law’s purpose: “So, like, one kid can say ‘I live with my parents,’ but another one has to say ‘I live in a house with two adult men who bought me when I was young’?” She is followed by Pauline, a Weary Mother in Her Darkest Hour (Ego Nwodim). Ostensibly on to discuss Rhianna’s high-profile pregnancy, Pauline runs through a litany of her own trials and tribulations: “I’ve had babies before, but this my worst pregnancy yet. It’s making me want to eat all kinds of things — pickles, peanut butter, the barrel of a shotgun.” No one in the cast plays hilariously weary and defeated as well as Nwodim. Aidy Bryant introduces the next sketch, which she was given free rein to write in order to show a new side of herself (her reward for playing over 150 “teachers, principals, mothers, women named Dianne, Susan or Teacher”). In The Sexual Woman, Bryant plays a seductress swooned over by Isaac at his most over-the-top dashing. Between the actual sketch – involving a spaghetti dinner and lots of “boner” talk – and various breakings of the fourth wall (including cuts to Bryant’s pre-recorded video message), it’s another case of too many things going on at once. It also very much wants to make a statement about the types of roles certain women get to play, and while it never gets didactic, it also never gets funny. In Over Your Head is a home improvement talk show featuring “folks who got a little overconfident taking on projects around the house”. Host Gus (Keenan Thompson) interviews Tommy (Kyle Mooney), who tried to build his own pool to save some money, only to puncture his septic tank; Felix (Isaac, doing a believably lispy Latin accent) who, while attempting to install his own circuit breaker, electrocuted himself so badly that he had an out of body experience and realized “there’s no God”; and finally, Gus’s long-suffering wife Clarissa (Nwodim, naturally), who reveals that their own home – as well as their home life – is falling apart due to his idiocy and incompetence. The show closes out with a sketch set in a fiction writing workshop. Isaac plays a shy, bookworm janitor invited to join in on the class and read some of his own writing. His story starts out as an elegant work of autofiction, before it turns the corner into creepy erotic fantasy centered around pop star Dua Lipa, much to the discomfort of the women in the class and the interest of the men. Although an uneven episode on the whole, this week’s SNL had slightly more ups than downs. If there weren’t any big standout moments, neither were there any big embarrassments. Isaac made a game host, throwing himself into his parts with noticeable gusto. The show would be wise to bring him back soon, as he has a real knack for comedy. Meanwhile, SNL remains on the (gradual) upswing.",Arts/Television & radio,Saturday Night Live: Oscar Isaac makes for game host in mixed bag episode,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/06/saturday-night-live-oscar-isaac
3/7/2022,"Women should play a central role in the UK’s post-pandemic economic recovery, with evidence revealing companies with more female leaders outperform those dominated by men, according to House of Commons research. Accusing the government of ignoring women’s needs during the coronavirus pandemic and side-lining them in plans for recovery, the shadow secretary for women and equalities, Anneliese Dodds, said the data showed women held the key to a stronger economy, but they were being held back by a lack of investment and the risk of “childcare deserts” in parts of the country. “When you’ve got more engagement from women, when women are in the driving seat to the extent they should be, it makes for far more successful businesses,” she said. “Our commitment is to consider women’s concerns and other equality issues from the start. The problem with the current government is they’re not even tacking women’s concerns on at the end, they’re not considering them at all.” She warned that the UK was facing a “childcare emergency” with early years settings struggling to recruit staff and the Early Years Alliance reporting that some areas of England have seen a 25% decline in the number of places in the past six years. “The childcare sector is facing a short-term emergency, seeing childcare deserts in different parts of the country, with providers going bust and not being able to continue operating – that has an awful impact on working women,” said Dodds. “Childcare providers are part of our economic infrastructure, we have to find a more sustainable way forward.” To mark International Women’s Day, which is on Tuesday, Labour have collated data from the House of Commons library. It cited McKinsey research that shows companies in the top quartile for gender diversity on executive teams were 25% more likely to have above-average profitability than companies in the bottom, while companies with more than 30% female executives were more likely to outperform companies that don’t, according to research from academics from the Universities of Glasgow and Leicester. But only eight women, and no women of colour, are currently employed as CEOs in the FSTE 100, while women hold only 14% of executive directorships and 38% of all directorships, according to the Fawcett Society’s Sex and Power report 2022. The data shows that women-led SMEs contribute about £85bn to economic output, but Beis research shows that only 16% of small business employers and one in three of entrepreneurs are women. There is further evidence that fewer women get access to financing and business loans, with only 15% of bank financing applications and 22% of new primary business bank accounts openings coming from women. Dodds said Labour would create 100,000 government-backed start-ups with a “equal recovery pledge” ensuring female representation, strengthen the pay gap reporting system and give a “new deal” for working women. “​​Unless we actually back women in business, then we’re going to be losing out on a huge amount of potential extra economic activity and prosperity, that all of our communities really need,” she said. New global data from gender equity researcher Equileap, released for IWD, shows that in the UK, women make up only a fifth (20%) of executive team members, 13 companies (6%) have a female CEO, and 27 companies (13%) have a female CFO. NatWest is the only company with both a female CEO and CFO. The analysis also found that the UK is one of the worst performing countries on flexible work options, with only 29% of companies publishing a flexible hours policy, and just 18% publishing a flexible locations policy.",News/Business,"Companies with female leaders outperform those dominated by men, data shows",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/06/companies-with-female-leaders-outperform-those-dominated-by-men-data-shows
3/7/2022,"The release of The Batman, starring Robert Pattinson, is being heralded as the beginning of an anticipated post-pandemic blockbuster boom, with UK box office sales forecast to double this year to top £1bn for the first time since 2019. While Daniel Craig’s last outing as James Bond in No Time to Die provided the UK with its biggest October in box office history, and Spiderman: No Way Home, which launched in December as the Omicron variant hit, has taken more than $1.8bn (£1.4bn) to date to become the sixth biggest film of all time, both were released while Covid rules were in place or looming. The Batman, by contrast, is being described as the first true post-pandemic blockbuster as many countries including the UK are now officially free of all coronavirus restrictions. The opening of the film in London on Friday marked the start of a return to the era of “normal” cinemagoing and will be closely watched to see if people’s habits will change. “The huge success of Bond and Spiderman proved that cinema is back, but both did it within Covid when cinemagoing was not considered to be back to normal conditions,” says David Hancock, film analyst at Omdia. “We will be judging Batman as the first ‘post-Covid film’, if you like, on its pure merits. The hesitancy to return to cinema and the rush when fans starved of big new releases were actually able to see one are now not factors. The question for Batman is simply, will people like it, and that is how films should be judged.” Omdia is forecasting that the UK box office will hit about £1.1bn this year, about double the £557m of 2021, and almost four times the disastrous pandemic low of £297m in 2020. This would put it just 10% or so down on pre-pandemic 2019’s record £1.25bn. Hollywood studios that held back releases for fear of death by box office during the pandemic have faith that this year will see a sustained recovery, with a string of blockbusters lined up, from Top Gun: Maverick and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever to the eagerly anticipated Avatar 2 this Christmas. “We have had false starts,” says Tim Richards, the chief executive and founder of Vue, the third largest cinema chain in the UK. “But this looks and feels like the epidemic is in the proverbial rearview mirror. When Batman opens next week, there will be no restrictions in the UK, absolutely nothing.” While an industry pushed to the brink of failure has a vested interest in talking up its own prospects, some in the scientific world suggest the world may finally have turned a corner. Last month, the chief executive of vaccine maker Moderna predicted that the pandemic would end this year, with Covid becoming an endemic disease kept in check by annual boosters. However, some hesitancy in the cinema sector remains, with the number of big releases this year remaining below pre-pandemic levels. Omdia forecasts that the UK box office will not surpass 2019 levels until 2023. In the US, there were 129 major film releases in 2019. This fell to just 46 in 2020, before climbing to 92 last year. The forecast this year is currently somewhere between 101 and 115 – “back to within touching distance of normality”, says Hancock. “We will not see 2019 levels this year,” says Richards. “But I think there is no doubt we have proven cinema is back. My goal within another week or two is to not be speaking about the past and only about the future.” However, any global recovery of the film industry will be slowed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Last week, the big five Hollywood studios – Disney, Warner Bros, Sony, Universal and Paramount – announced a halt to all film releases in Russia, with The Batman, due to be released there on Friday, becoming the first major film to be affected. The bans could well be extended to Moscow’s ally Belarus, while the war in Ukraine has of course halted all cinema activity there. Russia is the world’s 10th-largest market by box office revenues, worth about $1bn before the pandemic for cinemagoers seeing foreign and homegrown fare, and the sixth biggest in terms of ticket sales. The overall impact on the global box office is likely to be about $500m. “The film industry has done the right thing. It is wrong to release films in Russia at this time,” says Hancock. “From an economic point of view, the impact is not going to be a major problem; it won’t affect the wider international market.”",Arts/Film,Film industry banks on The Batman to mark start of ‘post-Covid’ cinema,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/06/film-industry-the-batman-box-office-sales-covid-pandemic
3/7/2022,"A prominent member of the Brazilian right is facing calls to resign after he was exposed in leaked audio messages making a succession of callous and misogynistic remarks about Ukrainian refugees during a purportedly humanitarian mission to the recently invaded country. Arthur do Val, a São Paulo congressman and former supporter of Brazil’s rightwing president, Jair Bolsonaro, made a three-day trip to the region last week, supposedly to raise awareness of the human cost of Vladimir Putin’s attack. On Thursday Do Val, 35, tweeted a photograph of himself surrounded by crates of motolov cocktails in the border city of Uzhhorod. His traveling partner, the rightwing activist Renan Santos, said they had donated thousands of dollars, helped refugees cross the border and “filmed the reality of a country at war”. Do Val’s trip had the blessing of Sergio Moro, the conservative ex-judge and minister who hopes to challenge Bolsonaro and his leftwing rival Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in October’s presidential election. “It’s always commendable when we put our words into practice,” Moro tweeted. Such ostensibly noble objectives were shattered on Friday, however, when the Brazilian media published audio messages in which Do Val spoke in highly offensive terms about Ukrainian refugees – more than 1.3 million of whom have fled overseas since Vladimir Putin’s 24 February invasion. In one recording, the politician says: “I’ve just crossed the border on foot between Ukraine and Slovakia. Bro, I swear to you … I’ve never seen anything like it in terms of beautiful girls. The refugee queue … it’s like 200metres-long or more of just total goddesses … It’s some incredible shit … The queue outside Brazil’s best nightclub … doesn’t come close to the refugee queue here.” In a second excerpt Do Val says: “Let me tell you, they’re easy because they’re poor.” In a third he makes obscene remarks about female security officials at the Ukraine/Slovakia border, before adding: “Just unbelievable, dude. As soon as this war’s over, I’m coming back.” The comments sparked revulsion, with more than 40,000 people signing an online petition demanding Do Val’s expulsion from São Paulo’s 94-seat parliament. Fabiana Tronenko, the wife of Ukraine’s former ambassador to Brazil, published a tearful Twitter video in which she called the politician a shameless cretin. “Show some respect, you punk … You’ve no idea what the Ukrainian people are going through.” Ukraine’s chargé d’affaires in Brazil, Anatoliy Tkach, called the remarks unacceptable. Do Val, who returned to Brazil on Saturday to discover he had lost key allies and his girlfriend, apologised and sought to justify his words. After three days “without drinking water or having a shower” he claimed he had become “over-excited”. “My mind was racing. I talked nonsense,” he said, abandoning plans to run for São Paulo’s governorship. Critics were unimpressed, calling his behaviour typical of Brazil’s chauvinist and testosterone-charged hard-right. “How nauseating,” tweeted Gleisi Hoffmann, the president of Brazil’s Workers’ party. “This is the kind of person who elected Bolsonaro! He must be stripped of power.”",News/World news,Brazilian politician’s sexist remarks about Ukraine refugees spark outrage,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/06/brazilian-politician-arthur-do-val-sexist-remarks-ukraine-refugees-outrage
