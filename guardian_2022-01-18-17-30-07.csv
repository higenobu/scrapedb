1/18/2022,"The Tennis Australia board has come out in support of its under-pressure chief executive, Craig Tiley, while acknowledging it “deeply regrets” the distraction the Novak Djokovic deportation saga caused other Australian Open players. The Jayne Hrdlicka-led board, which has been quiet throughout the two weeks of the scandal, finally broke its silence on Tuesday evening to note it “respects the decision of the immigration minister and the finding of the federal court of Australia” in cancelling Djokovic’s visa and then dismissing his bid to have it restored.  “Tennis Australia has been working closely with both the federal and Victorian government for the past year to deliver a Covid-safe Australian Open for the players, staff, and fans,” the board said in a statement. “Embarking on a major international sporting event during a global pandemic that continues to evolve and challenge us all, is profoundly demanding for all stakeholders. “The board and member associations commend the Tennis Australia CEO and the entire Tennis Australia team for their hard work and dedication to delivering a spectacular summer of tennis.” Tiley, who is also the tournament director, has found himself in the firing line over Tennis Australia’s role in allowing the unvaccinated Djokovic to fly to Melbourne under the belief that a medical exemption approved by TA and a Victorian government independent expert panel would be sufficient to enter Australia. Tiley, who has not spoken publicly since Djokovic left the country on Sunday night, has faced calls to resign over the crisis which sparked an international diplomatic tit-for-tat and highly charged domestic political finger-pointing. Australian tennis great John Newcombe has questioned the absence of the board throughout the saga, while former TA president Steve Healy demanded an explanation about what it knew. “Surely the board were aware of this? They should have been,” Healy told Nine. “It’s such a large reputational risk, not just in terms of the tournament but the relationship with government. If it’s just been run by management, I’d say, why weren’t the board involved?” The board ultimately has the power to terminate Tiley’s employment but any suggestion it might do so appears to have been quashed. Tuesday’s lengthy statement – in stark contrast to Sunday’s short and belated tweet – mentioned Tennis Australia’s achievements in staging “one of the world’s greatest sporting events” but also addressed the issue that has overshadowed the first grand slam of the year. “As the Australian tennis family, we recognise that recent events have been a significant distraction for everyone, and we deeply regret the impact this had on all players,” it said. “There are always lessons to learn, and we will review all aspects of our preparation and implementation to inform our planning – as we do every year. That process always starts once the Australian Open champions have lifted their trophies.”",Sport/Sport,Tennis Australia board breaks silence to ‘commend’ Craig Tiley following Novak Djokovic saga ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/18/tennis-australia-board-breaks-silence-to-commend-craig-tiley-following-novak-djokovic-saga
1/18/2022,"I have a wonderful partner, and we’re getting married next year after three years together. We live together, and both work quite intense jobs. I’ve always been quite a sexual person, but recently my libido has fallen off a cliff. It’s like I don’t even have sex organs any more, which is a bit frightening. My partner has a high sex drive and I worry he is unfulfilled, despite saying he doesn’t mind. I think he takes it personally, but I love him very much. We are often not in the house at the same time and keep quite different hours because of his job. I have had a traumatic year, with a few bereavements and family illness, and wonder if this has affected my sex drive. My question is, how can I get it back? Bereavement and trauma are two fairly common reasons for lowered libido. This is normally temporary, but you need time to recover and heal. Help your partner to understand your lack of desire is not about him – ask him to be patient. And try not to let your anxiety about your libido escalate, as that could make things worse. Any kind of loss can lead to depression, and it could be worth seeking some therapeutic help if you don’t feel like yourself pretty soon. Like anxiety, depression is another likely culprit when libido drops. Many people have become depressed as a result of the losses of our time – lockdowns, health issues, curbs on our freedoms, financial struggles and job losses – and sexual problems often follow. Mental and sexual health can never be taken for granted. Now more than ever, we must find ways to soothe, nurture and sustain ourselves. This too shall pass.

1/18/2022,"The cocktail of chemical pollution that pervades the planet now threatens the stability of global ecosystems upon which humanity depends, scientists have said. Plastics are of particularly high concern, they said, along with 350,000 synthetic chemicals including pesticides, industrial compounds and antibiotics. Plastic pollution is now found from the summit of Mount Everest to the deepest oceans, and some toxic chemicals, such as PCBs, are long-lasting and widespread.  The study concludes that chemical pollution has crossed a “planetary boundary”, the point at which human-made changes to the Earth push it outside the stable environment of the last 10,000 years. Chemical pollution threatens Earth’s systems by damaging the biological and physical processes that underpin all life. For example, pesticides wipe out many non-target insects, which are fundamental to all ecosystems and, therefore, to the provision of clean air, water and food. “There has been a fiftyfold increase in the production of chemicals since 1950 and this is projected to triple again by 2050,” said Patricia Villarrubia-Gómez, a PhD candidate and research assistant at the Stockholm Resilience Centre (SRC) who was part of the study team. “The pace that societies are producing and releasing new chemicals into the environment is not consistent with staying within a safe operating space for humanity.” Dr Sarah Cornell, an associate professor and principal researcher at SRC, said: “For a long time, people have known that chemical pollution is a bad thing. But they haven’t been thinking about it at the global level. This work brings chemical pollution, especially plastics, into the story of how people are changing the planet.” Some threats have been tackled to a larger extent, the scientists said, such as the CFC chemicals that destroy the ozone layer and its protection from damaging ultraviolet rays. Determining whether chemical pollution has crossed a planetary boundary is complex because there is no pre-human baseline, unlike with the climate crisis and the pre-industrial level of CO2 in the atmosphere. There are also a huge number of chemical compounds registered for use – about 350,000 – and only a tiny fraction of these have been assessed for safety. So the research used a combination of measurements to assess the situation. These included the rate of production of chemicals, which is rising rapidly, and their release into the environment, which is happening much faster than the ability of authorities to track or investigate the impacts. The well-known negative effects of some chemicals, from the extraction of fossil fuels to produce them to their leaking into the environment, were also part of the assessment. The scientists acknowledged the data was limited in many areas, but said the weight of evidence pointed to a breach of the planetary boundary. “There’s evidence that things are pointing in the wrong direction every step of the way,” said Prof Bethanie Carney Almroth at the University of Gothenburg who was part of the team. “For example, the total mass of plastics now exceeds the total mass of all living mammals. That to me is a pretty clear indication that we’ve crossed a boundary. We’re in trouble, but there are things we can do to reverse some of this.” Villarrubia-Gómez said: “Shifting to a circular economy is really important. That means changing materials and products so they can be reused, not wasted.” The researchers said stronger regulation was needed and in the future a fixed cap on chemical production and release, in the same way carbon targets aim to end greenhouse gas emissions. Their study was published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology There are growing calls for international action on chemicals and plastics, including the establishment of a global scientific body for chemical pollution akin to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Prof Sir Ian Boyd at the University of St Andrews, who was not part of the study, said: “The rise of the chemical burden in the environment is diffuse and insidious. Even if the toxic effects of individual chemicals can be hard to detect, this does not mean that the aggregate effect is likely to be insignificant. “Regulation is not designed to detect or understand these effects. We are relatively blind to what is going on as a result. In this situation, where we have a low level of scientific certainty about effects, there is a need for a much more precautionary approach to new chemicals and to the amount being emitted to the environment.” Boyd, a former UK government chief scientific adviser, warned in 2017 that assumption by regulators around the world that it was safe to use pesticides at industrial scales across landscapes was false. The chemical pollution planetary boundary is the fifth of nine that scientists say have been crossed, with the others being global heating, the destruction of wild habitats, loss of biodiversity and excessive nitrogen and phosphorus pollution.",News/Environment,"Chemical pollution has passed safe limit for humanity, say scientists",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/18/chemical-pollution-has-passed-safe-limit-for-humanity-say-scientists
1/18/2022,"The Perrottet government will have to rework large parts of the environmental impact statement for its proposal to raise the Warragamba dam wall, according to officials responsible for assessing the project. NSW environment officials have told the government its analysis, published in September, has failed to properly assess or justify impacts to the Greater Blue Mountains world heritage area that would be caused by the $1.6bn plan to raise the wall by up to 17 metres.  In responses published by the department of planning, industry and environment, Heritage NSW and the department’s environment, energy and science division (EES) both offered significant criticisms of the project. The environment division’s response identified numerous problems with the assessment including that an evaluation of the project’s impact on world heritage values had been based on “incorrect assumptions”. Officials wrote that the assessment of the WaterNSW project also incorrectly excluded Aboriginal heritage from the world heritage values of the area and there was a risk that sites of high cultural value had not been identified. “EES does not consider the impacts of the project on the natural and cultural values of the national parks estate and Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area have been adequately assessed or justified,” Dean Knudson, the deputy secretary of biodiversity, conservation and science wrote in the 88-page response. Among their concerns, environment officials wrote that the assessment’s conclusion that the project would have minimal impact on threatened species was “not supported by the data or evidence”. The EIS also had not addressed requests from the World Heritage Committee that the government fully consider all potential impacts to the outstanding universal values of the area, including Aboriginal cultural values, or whether raising the wall would exacerbate bushfire risk and threaten the recovery of species and habitat. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Environment officials highlighted inadequate surveys of threatened species habitat and wrote the assessment of aquatic ecology had failed to identify that raising the dam wall would result in inundation of about 284km of rivers and streams during floods. They said while WaterNSW had correctly identified the process for sourcing environmental offsets for the project, it had failed to identify the actual location of proposed offsets or whether the offsets requirements could even be met. In a separate response, Heritage NSW wrote the assessment underestimated the area’s cultural significance. It said the impact to Aboriginal cultural heritage values would be significant. Heritage NSW’s executive director Sam Kidman wrote that the “presence and clear expression of dreaming stories and songlines in the archaeological record of the Burragorang Valley” was unique and could not be offset, even if similar sites were identified. The response states that clear concerns raised by the Aboriginal community had not been addressed “and there has not been a concerted effort to redesign or appropriately mitigate the impacts”. The department has published 2,088 public submissions responding to the EIS. An analysis it commissioned of 2,067 responses found 1,931 were opposed to the project. Of those objections, the most frequently raised concerns were about impacts on biodiversity (raised in 80% of submissions), the world heritage area (50% of submissions) and cultural heritage sites (47% of submissions). Harry Burkitt, of the Colong Foundation for Wilderness, said the responses from government agencies demonstrated “the farcical nature of the entire EIS process” and the “complete failure of due diligence”. “For the past four years, minister Stuart Ayres and his departments, WaterNSW and Infrastructure NSW, have attempted to force the NSW government into supporting the raising of the Warragamba dam wall. Their attempts have now comprehensively failed,” he said. Kazan Brown is a Gundungurra woman whose great-great-great-grandfather, John Joseph Riley, owned land at Burnt Flat, which is in the inundation zone. She said the written advice of both environment officials and Heritage NSW reiterated “everything we’ve said from the start”. “The consultation [from WaterNSW] was useless, it wasn’t real,” she said. “What they did was they came and told us what they were going to do and they went and did it and didn’t care what we had to say. “All along we have said the cultural surveys and assessments had not been properly done.” A letter from the department asks WaterNSW to make several changes, including conducting a more comprehensive survey of Aboriginal cultural heritage values and of likely impacts to the world heritage area. It also asks WaterNSW to detail the proposed offsets for all damage the project would cause. A spokesperson for WaterNSW said: “WaterNSW will now review the submissions received during the public exhibition and address the issues raised in a submissions report to the Department of Planning and Environment”. Comment was sought from the minister for western Sydney, Stuart Ayres.

1/18/2022,"As he steps out of the mosque on the banks of the Kholpetua River, Mohammed Sabud Ali looks out at a view he has seen several times a day for most of his life. But never before has the sprawling Sundarbans mangrove forest felt so important to him. The vast Sundarbans has always protected Bangladeshi coastal communities from the violent cyclones that regularly crash in from the Bay of Bengal, and they have always harvested its resources. But now, as the climate crisis encroaches, people are becoming even more dependent on the forest.  Ali lives on the island of Gabura, at the entrance to the Sundarbans. Gabura is so exposed to the climate that it is best known for the numbers of people who have abandoned it. Rarely does a year pass without cyclones that break the embankments, leading to salt water flooding in and making the land infertile. Those who stay on Gabura have few options for making a living; they can work on boats, as day labourers, or turn to the Sundarbans itself. “We are dependent on the river and the forests. Everyone goes now to the forests. For honey, fish, crabs,” says Ali, who is in his 50s. The climate crisis is affecting our world in severe and unexpected ways, from flooding and drought, to rising sea levels. That's why the Guardian and Observer are taking action. Our 2021 charity appeal is supporting four charities (Practical Action, Environmental Justice Foundation, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and Global Greengrants Fund UK) that help those who have been displaced or had their lives severely disrupted by extreme weather caused by the climate emergency.  Donations can be made online by credit card, debit card or P The island is defined by the rivers that snake through the Sundarbans. Pairs of crab catchers sit on the small canoes that dot that vast Kholpetua, filling their nets as much as they can during fishing trips that last days. They return to Gabura’s small docks, the entry point for produce from the Sundarbans to labourers, cows and motorbikes returning from the mainland. The whole tattered embankment, still damaged by the last cyclone, is lined with boats, tied up and being repaired before their next journey into the mangroves. Gabura is one of numerous settlements along the long frontier between Bangladesh’s coast and the Sundarbans that rely on the forest for a living. Most locals say that dependency is increasing, raising fears that the forest could be pushed too far by businesses and tourism, threatening the delicate ecosystem. The government imposes a licence system restricting entry to the forest. For locals, who have few other options, the licences are a nuisance. “There are maybe 100 licences at a time and 10,000 people needing to go to the forest,” says Ali. “In the name of saving nature, they put our lives at risk.” Climate change has made the region poorer, with almost 50% living in poverty, according to the World Bank. Cyclones have increased migration, whether for seasonal labour or longer-term resettlement. According to a report last year by Anti-Slavery International, this has had a knock-on effect, making people more vulnerable to modern slavery. Traffickers target people who want to migrate, or lure them with promises of work to places such as Dublar Char – a remote Sundarbans island where children can be found working in fish processing. Bishawjit Mallick, a researcher at Dresden University of Technology, who grew up in the region, says he has seen dependency on the forest increase during his lifetime but that business interests have also driven activity. Previously, a select number of villagers took responsibility for the forests, catching only what was within the reach of their small boats, but as Bangladesh’s road network has developed, big business has turned hungrily towards the region’s resources. “If I recall,” says Mallick, “30 years ago, there was not too much extraction from the Sundarbans. There were some specific groups who took for their needs – fish, crabs or to cut from the golpata tree – but it was not so many. “It was a specific group and everyone knew who they were. My grandfather used to call a specific person who he knew could bring honey for us. “There was a harmonious relationship – they realised they shouldn’t extract everything, but over time as others got involved to go there for tourism, for business, then the relationship changed. Small fishermen couldn’t survive because of the big businessmen,” he says. A survey of more than 1,000 households published by Mallick last year found that almost all villagers nearby relied on the forest to some extent, especially young people who had received little education. The study argued that the future relied on decreasing dependency by diversifying livelihoods, making communities more resilient and regulating access more effectively. “Now we see the Sundarbans is still producing lots of trees and resources but if you go to the interior, deep into the centre, you will see a lot of vacant spaces,” he said. “When the threshold has been reached, when people cannot take any more, then it will be a big issue. They will lose its protection from cyclones.” The forest also poses dangers, with pirates and bandits kidnapping villagers who venture inside and holding them for ransom. There is also the threat of Bengal tigers, which still roam the forests despite being pushed close to extinction by human settlement. Abdul Hakim, 61, a retired teacher, says: “We also fear the forest; my elder brother was killed here by a tiger when he was collecting shrimps and I’ve been scared of it since.” In the 20 years since his brother’s death, he has seen his pupils and his own family become increasingly reliant on the forest for their living. “Our people come here for everything: they catch crabs, they come here to collect honey, to collect firewood,” he says. “We’re entirely dependent on the Sunderbans.

1/18/2022,"Aminute into Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers’ 1959 standard Moanin’, its bluesy piano refrain is blown open by the piercing burst of a single trumpet note. That is Lee Morgan at 20 years old, soloing with a confidence that would come to define the so-called “hard bop” sound of jazz label Blue Note. At 18, he had already played with legendary composer Dizzy Gillespie and, by 19, he was accompanying John Coltrane. By 33, he was dead – shot by his partner Helen.  Joining the ranks of pioneering jazz musicians who died too young, like Clifford Brown and Albert Ayler, Morgan never reached household name status like fellow trumpeters Miles Davis, Louis Armstrong or Chet Baker. Yet he was well on his way with an astonishing 25 albums recorded as a bandleader for Blue Note and countless appearances as a sideman. Much like his life was cut short, so is his legacy – pressed to wax and then resigned to the archive. Kasper Collin’s 2016 documentary I Called Him Morgan is a masterful and much-needed act of remembrance, bringing Morgan’s genius back to life, as well as examining his downfall with a compassion that avoids reducing its tragedy into a true crime saga. We begin like the meandering and unpredictable opening of an instrumental solo with the swaggering figure of Larry Reni Thomas, a jazz DJ and North Carolina teacher. In the early 90s, he discovered that Morgan’s widow Helen was attending his adult education class and subsequently convinced her to give him an interview in February 1996, only a month before she died. Helen’s half-swallowed voice comes to us through the tape hiss to describe her childhood growing up in Wilmington and having two children at only 13 and 14 out of wedlock before leaving them in North Carolina with her grandparents and moving to New York at 17. There, her apartment became a key hang for musicians – largely due to the pot of beans she would always have on the stove. We then cut to Morgan – 13 years Helen’s junior – as remarkable footage of him playing with Gillespie and Blakey in the late 1950s showcases a towering creative force hidden within the fresh-faced, emaciated frame of a teenager. Talking heads including saxophonist Wayne Shorter, Gillespie’s drummer Charli Persip and bassist Larry Ridley spell out his precocious genius, while the black-and-white photos of Blue Note co-founder Francis Wolff express the cool camaraderie of now-legendary recording sessions. With only a 1971 recorded interview of Morgan available, his horn does most of the speaking throughout the film, building an impressionistic image that encircles the man behind the music. Signifiers of his self-destruction begin to weave their way into Collin’s narrative though: the head bandage concealing a burn wound sustained after a heroin overdose; his adrenaline-fuelled need to race his car through Central Park; the anecdote of his turning up to a session after selling his shoes for drugs. He is eventually booted out of his groups and ends up on the street without a coat and with a mouthful of broken teeth. One day, Helen sees him and offers shelter from the snow. They soon become “confidantes and lovers”, the composer Benny Maupin recounts. Morgan gets clean and gets back to music with Helen as his manager. As his star once again ascends, though, he begins an affair and Helen is sidelined. Through the whirring of the tape recording she tells us how she battled through a February snowdrift to see Morgan play a show at New York’s Slugs club in 1972, as they were becoming estranged. He had totaled his car on the way to the venue and between shaky sets they had an argument. Then, “we heard two pops and that was it,” saxophonist Billy Harper solemnly recounts. Morgan is shot and, while the ambulance spends an hour battling through the weather to get to him, he bleeds to death. Just as breath builds pressure to produce a horn’s note, so Collin’s narrative in I Called Him Morgan is shrouded in evocative atmospheres of sound, archive images and snippets of testimony that build to the climax of this murder. Ultimately, it is a film not just for jazz fans; it is the story of the bonds made through crisis and the chaos that ensues when that crisis consumes. The questions that remain reflect the incompleteness of Morgan’s life and music, as well as the faltering continuation of Helen’s, who moved back to Wilmington after her jail sentence for manslaughter and spent her time volunteering in the church. She died before she could complete her interview with Thomas. All we are left with are voices, memories, and – perhaps most importantly – the wordless stories of music.

1/18/2022,"Scott Morrison has urged parents to ignore the “dangerous messages” of government MP George Christensen who suggested children should not get vaccinated against Covid. The prime minister on Wednesday strongly rebuked the controversial Nationals MP and called on parents to instead listen to the “world’s best regulators”.  Morrison has been under pressure to rein in Coalition MPs who consistently undermine the government’s health advice after Novak Djokovic was deported partly because his presence could “foster anti-vaccination sentiment”. “I strongly disagree with the message sent out by Mr Christensen regarding children’s vaccinations,” Morrison said in a statement. “It is contrary to the official professional medical advice provided to the government and I urge parents to disregard his dangerous messages in relation to vaccines.” Morrison said vaccinations were the country’s “primary weapon” against the Covid-19 virus. He noted more than 90% of Australians aged over 16 were now fully vaccinated. “If you are not vaccinated against the virus you are more likely to experience severe illness and die. Getting vaccinated saves lives,” he said. “This includes five to 11-year-olds who are provided with a special children’s vaccine that has been approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. These are the same medical experts who approve all other vaccines for children in Australia. They are the world’s best medical regulators. “These are the experts that have the knowledge, accountability and experience to provide the credible and reliable advice that parents need to make important decisions about their child’s best interests.” Australia’s chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, also urged parents to “listen to the experts” in the wake of Christensen’s remarks, while the health minister, Greg Hunt, said he “plainly” disagreed with the Queenslander. “Get your children vaccinated, please bring your children forward,” Hunt said on Wednesday. “Vaccinations save lives. I would flatly, plainly disagree with anyone who said that.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Kelly said people should take the advice of commonwealth and state chief medical officers and the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (Atagi), which was among “the best experts on immunisation in the world”. “We are of one voice – it is very important for children, now down to the age of five, to be vaccinated, and so please go ahead with that, and listen to the experts,” the chief medical officer said. In an attempt to promote his podcast, Christensen flagged he would “break the internet” with his call not to vaccinate children. On his Facebook page, Christensen said the podcast episode was “too hot” and would be censored by the tech giant. “I can’t even show you the title but I can tell you every parent should listen to it,” he said. The “Do NOT Vax Your Children” episode features an interview with Dr Robert Malone who claims to have invented mRNA technology but has reportedly been banned from Twitter for violations of its Covid-19 misinformation policy. Christensen, and several other Coalition MPs, have become vocal critics of the government’s vaccination program – campaigning against mandates and raising concerns about adverse events.

We’re at a 95% national 16-plus vaccination ... and it’s the Australian public, the Australian medical workforce, in partnership with local, state, territory and federal governments that have achieved that. So we’ll just keep going and we want that number to go higher.” According to the Therapeutic Goods Administration, evidence from clinical trials and real-world experience from overseas indicates that side-effects most commonly seen in the five to 11 age group were “mild and temporary”, similar to the safety profile in older populations. In clinical trials of over 2,000 children, most side-effects were reported in the first two to three days after vaccination, with the most common being a sore arm (70% of children), headache (25%) and tiredness (25%). In the US, where 8.7m doses have been administered to children in this age bracket, reports of more serious effects following vaccination were “extremely rare” with 100 reports from the 8.7m vaccine doses. Myocarditis – which is an inflammation of the heart – was also very rare in this age group with 11 mild cases from more than 8m doses. Kelly said the real-world experience gave Australian authorities additional assurance about the safety of the vaccine for children. “We have the advantage of watching multiple millions of children of that age group of five to 11 with the first and the second doses in the US [and] they have not seen a single issue in terms of severe safety signals,” he said. “We were looking very closely at that and so that’s a real reassurance that real-world experience, plus the TGA tick and Atagi in terms of safety and efficacy. [Vaccines] do work … particularly against severe disease in children the same as they do in adults.” More than 379,000 child vaccines have now been administered in Australia with Hunt saying that this number was expected to top 500,000 in the coming days.",News/Australia news,Scott Morrison rebukes George Christensen for ‘dangerous messages’ on vaccinating children,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/18/scott-morrison-rebukes-george-christensen-for-dangerous-messages-on-vaccinating-children
