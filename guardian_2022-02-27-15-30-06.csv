2/27/2022,"Over the past couple of years, makeup – or, in industry parlance, “colour cosmetics” – took a hit. No one was in the mood to play around with makeup. There was nowhere to go, no one to see (Zoom doesn’t count) and so what was the point of a full maquillage? It seemed like an utter waste of energy. And it’s taken us a while to move beyond our colour hiatus. Which is why you’ll still find that even the usually most up-to-date and experimental makeup bags are in dire need of an MOT. So, as we inch towards a new normal and the optimism of spring, never has there been more of a yearning (or need) to return to colour. That said, it would be disingenuous of me to claim everyone is now hankering after sunny yellow eyeshadow or that extreme Julia Fox-esque liner (Google it). The desire, however, for luxe lip colours, especially encouraged by the fact that our lips are no longer hidden behind masks, has made a welcome resurgence. The products on this page were chosen for their unwavering dedication to glorious formulations and great pigment, but also for their delicious, joy-inducing packaging. Because, rightly or wrongly, aesthetics count. These lipsticks understand the importance of colour that glides seamlessly across your lips, but they also understand the uplift that comes from using a lipstick encased in something that feels decadent, special and celebratory. And, just as well, because this renewed love for colour is absolutely a cause for celebration. 1. Dolce & Gabbana Beauty Sheer Lips £33, harrods.com2.

2/27/2022,"Matt William Knowles, a 36-year-old Hollywood actor, has been packing for a forthcoming trip to China in the past week. He’s looking forward to his first China visit since the pandemic. “The last time I was in China was late 2019 when I served as the honorary mayor for a village in southern China.” While his career in Hollywood continues to blossom, finding work in China hasn’t been easy these past few years for Knowles. The pandemic changed the film industry, and the deteriorating diplomatic relations between America and China sandwiched individuals like him who straddle both nations. For a period of time in 2019, amid a souring trade war between the two countries, Chinese studios put an informal ban on American actors. “China is now all about protecting Chinese interests. It’s China First,” he told the Observer, jokingly referencing former president Donald Trump’s favourite political mantra “America First”. “They put Chinese interests first and Chinese people first. But what they don’t have is the films that can appeal to the whole world.” For many years before the South Carolina native returned home, Knowles was an unlikely rising star in China. The former American football player has a matinee-star look that, together with his impeccable Mandarin skills after years of living in Beijing, have won him millions of fans. In America, he was known as “the Chris Hemsworth of China”. When Knowles first arrived in China as a volunteer in the summer of 2009, Hollywood movies were ubiquitous – but mostly in the form of pirated DVDs. In fact, Hollywood films were one of the earliest imports from the west after the post-Mao economic reforms in the late 1970s. Beijing has always understood the power of Hollywood in shaping its citizens’ minds. As a result, protectionist measures such as quotas and restrictions on the screening periods of Hollywood films in China, have led to the rapid growth of domestic films in the last two decades or so, said Dr How Wee Ng, lecturer in Chinese studies at the University of Westminster. “Increased living standards, national confidence, patriotic education alongside a growing demand for self-representation as resistance to western takes on Chinese culture such as Kung Fu Panda and Mulan have been crucial to the building of Chinese audiences and taste for domestic films,” Ng said. The attitude shift became more evident in 2017, when Knowles left China after years living and working there. That October, China’s president, Xi Jinping, declared: “It is time for us to take centre stage in the world and to make a greater contribution to humankind,” and that China was “standing tall and firm in the east”. Around the same time as that speech made international headlines, a slickly made nationalistic blockbuster called Wolf Warrior 2 made $870m at the box office. The plot of the film – where a selfless heroic Chinese soldier defended African workers and defeated an American aggressor – also coincided with the sharp rise of nationalism in China. So much so that the phrase “wolf warrior” has become the phrase synonymous with Beijing’s confrontational style of diplomacy. Beijing allows 34 foreign films to be imported every year. Yet, over the last decade, the share of non-Chinese films – Hollywood ones included – in box office sales has seen a downward trend, particularly since 2017, according to ticketing platform Maoyan Entertainment. Among the top 10 most profitable films on Maoyan in 2021, only two films, F9: The Fast Saga and Godzilla vs. Kong were non-Chinese. A decade ago, it was six. In the last few years, as China’s diplomatic relations with the west – and in particular the US – plummeted, the preferences of Chinese audiences changed, too. And this “has had a huge impact on Hollywood”, said Erich Schwartzel, author of Red Carpet: Hollywood, China, and the Global Battle for Cultural Supremacy. Schwartzel said that Chinese movie-goers are gradually walking away from Hollywood films. “Several years ago, just being a big-budget Hollywood movie might be enough in the Chinese market, but now you don’t just need good production but also a story that appeals to more discerning Chinese audiences.” This explains why Disney’s recent animated movie Encanto disappointed many Chinese observers, with a modest box office take of $3.7m in China, the world’s largest billion-dollar movie market. Globally, Encanto took $240m. Critics pointed out that the storyline did not resonate with a local Chinese audience. The improvement in domestic film-making did not come as a coincidence, Schwartzel noted, but as a result of a decade-long effort. In 2008, the success of Hollywood blockbuster Kung Fu Panda shocked China’s ruling Communist party. It sparked soul-searching among Chinese political elites and film producers. “They asked themselves: how could a quintessential Chinese film achieve such a success with American Hollywood?” The turning point was marked by Beijing’s homemade sci-fi movie, Wandering Earth in 2019. The $50m-budget film grossed nearly $700m worldwide. US magazine Hollywood Reporter called it: “China’s first full-scale interstellar spectacular”. Netflix came knocking on the door for global streaming rights. “It tells you that Beijing’s ambition to commercialise and develop its domestic film industry is working,” said Schwartzel. “Chinese audiences are more and more turning to domestic cultural products – reflecting also Beijing’s desire to turn Chinese people to look inward [in recent years].” The confluence of factors alarmed Hollywood studios, and as Sino-American relations deteriorate, there has been more uncertainty surrounding the future of American films in the world’s largest market. Since last year, films such as Shang-Chi, Spider-Man: No Way Home and Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow have yet to be released in mainland China. No official explanations were given. Instead, the patriotic war flick The Battle at Lake Changjin grossed more than $910m globally. “Just as American films and television programmes were welcomed in China as they played a pivotal role in the warming of Sino-American ties back in the 1970s, the reverse is happening today, when they can suffer from bans and censorship during times of global tension,” Ng said. For Knowles, the short period of discomfort as a result of the US-China trade war in 2019 has receded. “But since then, the pandemic separated the world as travels became harder. Right now, if Disney wants to work with China, they’ll have to prioritise China’s domestic audience,” he said. “China has been in a separate world living on its own. You might not like it, but it is what it is.”",Arts/Film,Uncharmed: why Chinese film fans are shunning Hollywood,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/27/uncharmed-why-chinese-film-fans-are-shunning-hollywood
2/27/2022,"Aldi Specially Selected Argentinian Malbec, Mendoza, Argentina 2020 (£5.99, Aldi) Is there a more reliable name on the side of a bottle than Argentinian malbec? By reliable I mean you know pretty much what to expect from producer to producer, in a no alarms and no surprises sort of a way. Certainly, at prices around £10 it offers a welcomingly reassuring predictability: generally these days you will get a wine of plump plummy fruit and generally unobtrusive tannins, a wine that satisfies the back-label cliché of boldly fruity “easy-drinking” in much the same, unthinking way that the best beach reads live up to their blurb’s “page-turning” promise. This knack is not to be under-estimated. It’s certainly made malbec an international bestseller. According to figures from Wines of Argentina, plantings of the variety have grown by some 171% since the beginning of the century, and by 56% since 2010, satisfying a thirst for the kind of affordable, bright blackberry and blueberry-filled reds embodied by Aldi’s thriftily sourced example. Riccitelli This is Not Another Lovely Malbec, Uco Valley, Mendoza, Argentina 2020 (from £12.79, allaboutwine.co.uk; lokiwine.co.uk; hic-winemerchants.com) The flipside to reliability is predictability, of course, and over-exposure to the many 100s of me-too malbecs being turned out by Argentina’s larger wineries can bring a craving for something else: a surprise or two, a little bit of excitement, some individuality. Many winemakers in Argentina want the same thing. Indeed, that desire to shake free of the formula is behind the name given to the adventurous winemaker Matías Riccitelli’s latest malbec. A rare outbreak of sarcasm and irony in the generally hyper-sincere world of wine, it’s Riccitelli’s way of signaling that this is a somewhat different style. Like many of the world’s most interesting producers at the moment, Riccitelli uses concrete vessels (rather than steel or oak) to make this and other, wines, believing that’s the best way to bring out the delightful scents of mulberry and cherry, and silky, slinky texture in a wine that Riccitelli might be disappointed to hear really does deserve the epithet “lovely”. Amalaya Malbec, Calchaquí, Salta, Argentina 2020 (from £10.49, rannochscott.co.uk; noblegreenwines.co.uk; haywines.co.uk) Riccitelli is very far from being the only winemaker to deviate from the successful but suffocating mass-market malbec conventions. There are, in fact, plenty of wines that prove malbec can be every bit as diversely expressive, evocative and surprising as established big hitters such as cabernet sauvignon, pinot noir or syrah. Most of the exciting bottles are the direct result of Argentine winegrowers greater understanding of the effects of altitude in what are some of the highest vineyards in the world, a development which has also allowed them to start identifying the personalities of different sub-zones in the main growing area of Mendoza, and in the even higher altitude wine valleys of Salta province in the far north west. Recent top-end Mendozan standouts for me include Bodega Piedra Negra in the Uco Valley and tiny production Per Se in Gualtallary, while Amalaya’s expression of its 1,828m altitude vineyard in the Calchaquí Valley is a bargain: wonderfully vivid, silky and full of charm.

2/27/2022,"Two days from the start of spring and I am itching to sow and grow. Bags and packets of seed are calling impatiently. But as I write, we are still unsure when we’ll be paroled to the plot. Perhaps longer than the three-month sentence we’d hoped for. I thought, then, to take time to look back this week on what I’ve missed most about communal gardening. Is it the in-the-distance company of other growers, perhaps picking their runner beans? Maybe Mary’s giant sunflowers and perfect poppies? The early-morning thrill of kestrels and foxes, the scent of another neighbour’s sweet peas? All this, of course. And the call of growing my forever flowers, the memories and peace of mind they come with. Howard and I don’t much make plans at the plot. We hunt and share good seed and grow it. Lose ourselves in nurture and nature. We will miss, though, the self-sown insistence of amaranth and orache, gone now with the old soil. Too soon to know what histories our imported earth will bring. Every year’s plot has had a different personality, depending on mood, the sun, the season; what we want to grow. The past two years, there were more flowers than ever before. I suspect this shift will stay. Our constant tagetes and nasturtiums, our flowering fennel, a few good food things– summer herbs and beans and salad leaves, Italian chicories in autumn. It’s yet too soon to say. It’s unclear when we’ll be back together again, conjuring new life from new soil and seeing what grows well when and where. Until then, Howard and I will make occasional pilgrimages to the plot. We may toast it with smoky whisky. We’ll gaze longingly over the fence to Plot 29. We’ll walk back slowly over the Heath. Search woods for signs of lords-and-ladies (Arum maculatum). And we’ll try to wait patiently. Allan Jenkins’s Plot 29 (4th Estate, £9.99) is out now.

2/27/2022,"The question In the 1970s, I was anorexic and was in hospital for months as a teenager after being admitted as a medical emergency weighing just 5st. In those days, treatment was harsh, drug-based and punitive in tone. I recovered to live a fulfilling life. I was married for 30 years, raised two children, worked as a teacher and ended my career as head of a large comprehensive school. After my husband died, I had to unravel the records and finances of his company and close it down, which was stressful and sad. He had been ill before he died and I had been his carer. Since then I have sold the family home and moved to start a new life near the sea. I have done everything I should – joined the church, a local choir, a gym and made friends with neighbours. However, lockdown happened in the middle of my move and I have had to spend a great deal of time alone. To cut a long story short, my old problem came back and has taken me over. My daughters live far away and both have families of their own. I miss them, they want me to visit, but I make excuses because I fear not being able to hide the anorexia from them. I’m stuck, obsessed with staying “empty”. I cannot eat a meal without wanting to vomit. I never eat a cooked meal and avoid eating with others. I am exercising, counting calories, weighing myself incessantly – and all in secret. I am absolutely terrified because I cannot seem to control this – it makes me happy to feel free of food. Even though I want to stop, I don’t want to stop. Anorexia at my age seems ridiculous. Because we don’t know each other, I feel you are the only person I can tell. It would be dreadful to take a place at a clinic because these should go to young people. Philippa’s answer Bloody pandemic! You had no control over that loneliness, it was over a long period, too, and even now that lockdown is lifted, we have lost some of the carefree feelings we had before. You’ve had a stressful time of it, looking after your late husband, winding down his affairs, grieving and moving. MOVING! Just about the most stressful thing after being widowed. Stress, loneliness, more stress and now a massive secret. You needed emergency soothing. Anorexia was an old coping mechanism so it’s no wonder you went back to it. The one thing your body knows how to do is control how much food you digest. It may give you a momentary feeling of control, a fleeting happiness even – except, like an addiction, it is now controlling you. You’ve taken the first step by telling someone – me. You are also not in denial about what you are doing, you have awareness. These are two positives. It would not be dreadful to take a place at the eating disorder clinic. You’ve a right as much as anyone else. In therapy groups everyone has much to teach and show each other, and age does not come into it. It can be too hard to control an addiction alone – you do deserve help. Last time, your treatment was a punitive experience, I hope we’ve moved on from that. Your next step is your GP, who can advise you about therapy. You may be prescribed antidepressants to tide you over until you find alternative ways to self-soothe and emotionally regulate. Your self-awareness is a very good sign that you will beat this. That awareness is your friend. The anorexia has a voice telling you not to eat, not to have fullness, to count the calories. Use your awareness to recognise that voice as a false friend, see it as an invader separate from yourself. The other invader you need to be aware of is the critical inner voice that causes you to feel ashamed. See this as separate from yourself, too. You won’t be able to stop either of these voices straight away, but observe them, rather than being them. Think of a goal – maybe visiting your children and their families – and the steps you need to achieve that goal. Break them down into doable, achievable steps. It doesn’t matter how small. A good first step was telling me. A next one might be telling a friend or your children what you have been going through. Secrecy is anorexia’s friend, and anorexia is your enemy posing as a friend. Many of us have fallen back into self-destructive behaviour during the pandemic and are finding it hard to establish better habits. You are not the only former addict who has slipped up. You were coping with so much already and were then plunged into loneliness before you’d had a proper chance to bond with a new community – there is no shame in that being too much to cope with. You don’t need shame and anorexia, you need professional help and self-compassion. I’m so glad you wrote to me.

2/27/2022,"I want to thank you so much for Sonia Sodha’s article (“The Trojan Horse Affair: how Serial podcast got it so wrong”, Focus). I was dismayed and depressed to listen to this New York Times podcast, which is one-sided, misleading and, in many instances, wrong. As a senior leader in one of the schools involved, I saw first hand the damage inflicted by, in our case, several rogue members on our governing body working with others beyond the school to undermine the curriculum, the leadership team and the social cohesion the school had cultivated so carefully and successfully. What they did had a catastrophic effect on the health and career of one senior colleague, caused anxiety and division among the staff, alarm and worry to pupils and their parents and the school, previously rated “good”, was eventually put into special measures. At least it meant the governing body had to go and we could begin to recover.Name and address supplied Sonia Sodha seems to acknowledge, albeit grudgingly, that the Trojan Horse Affair was indeed overshadowed by a “false narrative” of violent extremism in some Birmingham schools, a narrative that was fuelled by a phantom letter and relied on false tropes of regressive Muslim attitudes The allegations stoked Islamophobia on a national scale and Muslim communities are still living with the consequences. Concerns about child protection, governance and the role religion and culture play in schools are valid and should be discussed openly. Parents, teachers, governors and education officials could have come together through mutual respect to navigate expressions of faith in our school system in an inclusive way. Instead, policymakers and the media were blinded by a moral panic about Muslims, a suspicion of their motives and sheer prejudice about their beliefs and customs. To put it simply: the Trojan Horse hoax was weaponised, compounding institutional racism.Zara Mohammed, secretary general of the Muslim Council of BritainLondon E1 Thank you for filling the gaps in the Trojan Horse Serial podcast. The political motives of the initial investigation and origins of the letter could have been questioned while also shining a spotlight on how the systematic implementation of a religiously conservative ideology was affecting staff and pupils, particularly girls and women. These issues, including safeguarding, continue to be downplayed or portrayed as lies in a bid to exonerate the men. I sent Serial podcast our 2014 media statement, which was ignored, even though we spoke to Muslim witnesses directly. Among other things, segregation and girls wearing hijab were portrayed as choices but they were shamed into complying, otherwise they would not be good Muslims. Shaming into silence is a running theme even now but this time character assassination of critics like me on social media. I am glad the “old Muslim boys’ network” was dismantled but wish it had been exposed another way and not through the lens of extremism and Trojan Horse, as this conversation would have looked very different.Shaista Gohir, executive director of the Muslim Women’s Network UKBirmingham I very much enjoyed Laura Cumming’s article on the exhibition A Century of the Artist’s Studio: 1920-2020 at the Whitechapel Gallery (“Where the magic happens”, the New Review). I was intrigued by the comment on the photo of Picasso, “his masculinity barely concealed by a toga”. Was this some prophetic take on gender by Picasso? When I visited the show yesterday I saw that it’s Picasso’s genitals that are concealed by the toga; his masculinity looked as evident as ever. Maybe a bit less euphemism next time? Still, a great show with an inspiring recommendation.Karen ByrneLondon SW17 Your article “Starmer: Russians hide cash in ‘soft touch’ UK” (News) does not paint a proper picture of the link between the British Virgin Islands and Russian investment in UK property. The BVI has some of the strictest controls of any financial centre globally. We hold a beneficial ownership register for all companies in our territory that own property. Unlike many other jurisdictions, including the UK, only licensed corporate service providers can incorporate companies and by law they must conduct customer due diligence, including enhanced checks for politically exposed people. This beneficial ownership list is accessible by UK law enforcement and international agencies via our beneficial ownership secure search system. There is no evidence of illicit use of BVI companies being used (by Russian or other nationalities) to purchase property in the UK. The BVI does not have a disproportionate number of Russian companies compared with other financial centres; only 3%of the BVI companies worldwide are owned by Russians. The BVI is actively implementing UK-imposed sanctions on Russia Ukraine. As a leading financial centre, we will continue to tackle money laundering and corruption, while making a positive economic contribution globally, in the UK and in the BVI.Elise Donovan, chief executive officer, BVI FinanceRoad Town, British Virgin Islands The food strategy white paper is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for the UK government to set out a single visionary plan to transform England’s food system for our health, the economy and the planet. Recent gas and commodity price increases, CO2 shortages, tighter border controls and labour shortages have shown how important a coordinated approach to the food system is. It is only by taking an integrated, cross-government approach, building on the recommendations laid out in the National Food Strategy, that the government can lead the food system reform necessary to achieve its net zero and nature-positive commitments, tackle obesity and reduce inequalities. To do this, the white paper must commit first and foremost to new primary legislation demonstrating the government’s ambition in this space by putting in place the food system impact targets and long-term levers that will support the cross-government action that is needed to transform the food system for future generations. Through smart investment, aligned trade policy, standards and the right targets and laws in food, the government can unlock innovation and build resilient, sustainable supply chains and progressive partnerships with the best producers. The white paper, coming after the Cop26 climate summit, is a line in the sand moment to reduce the environmental impacts of England’s food system, increase access to and affordability of a healthy diet and support farmers, businesses and others to accelerate their transition towards more healthy, sustainable practices while providing high-quality employment in all parts of the country. With food system strategies and legislation under way in all the devolved nations, this is an excellent opportunity to consider how legislation introduced in Westminster could benefit everyone. We are calling on the government to commit to new primary legislation and champion food system change.Sustain; Food Foundation; WWF-UKHubbub, Compassion in World Farming; Eating Better; Friends of the Earth; Alexandra Rose Charity; Food Ethics Council; Food, Farming and Countryside Commission; Royal Society for the Protection of Birds; National Trust; Soil Association; The Landworkers’ Alliance; Bite Back 2030; Sustainable Food Trust; School Food Matters; Consensus Action on Salt, Sugar and Health; Real Farming Trust; Farm Wilder; CSA Network UK; PAN UK; The Food Teachers Centre; Pipers Farm; Dr Rosemary Green, associate professor in sustainability, nutrition and health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; Leeds City Council; Chefs in Schools; World Cancer Research Fund; Dr Rosalind Sharpe, director, Food Research Collaboration, Centre for Food Policy, City, University of London; Farms To Feed Us; Alliance to Save our Antibiotics; Trade Justice Movement; Slow Food in the UK; English Organic Forum; Farms Not Factories; Sustainable Restaurant Association; The Open Food Network; ProVeg UK; Plant-based Food Alliance UK; Dr Tara Garnett, University of Oxford; Humane Society International UK; Professor Tom MacMillan, Royal Agricultural University; SOS-UK; Black Butterfly; Forum for the Future; Wildlife and Countryside Link; Organic Farmers & Growers CIC; FOUR PAWS UK; Nature Friendly Farming Network; Diabetes UK; Wildfarmed; British Heart Foundation; Better Food Traders; Growing Communities; Changing Markets Foundation; G’s; Global Justice Now; Peas Please; Scrap Factory Farming (Humane Being); Bristol Food Producers; Feedback; Organic Research Centre; Professor Martin White, professor of population health research, University of Cambridge; Dr David Strain, chair of CMA Board of Science, British Medical Association; Bristol Food Network CIC; Professor Steven Cummins, Professor of Population Health & NIHR Senior Investigator, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; Professor Richard Smith, Deputy Pro-Vice Chancellor and Professor of Health Economics, University of Exeter; Professor Kate Pickett, co-director, Centre for Future Health, University of York; Dr Christopher Yap, Centre For Food Policy, City, University of London; British Dental Association; Professor Peter Ball, professor of operations management, University of York Management School; UK Association for the Study of Obesity; Dr Maria Bryant, reader in public health nutrition, University of York; N8 Research Partnership; Professor Katherine Denby, Centre for Novel Agricultural Products, University of York; Professor Bob Doherty, FixOurFood, University of York Management School; Royal Academy of Culinary Arts’ Adopt a School Trust; Greenpeace UK; The Equality Trust; OmniAction.org; Quota.Media; Asylum Support & Immigration; Resource Team (ASIRT); Geoff Tansey, curator, Food Systems Academy; Hull Food Partnership; Dr Kerry Ann Brown, senior lecturer in public health nutrition, College of Life & Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter; Professor Peter Jackson, professor of human geography, University of Sheffield; Dr Rachel Loopstra, lecturer in nutrition, King’s College London; Sustainable Soils Alliance (SSA); Pasture for Life; Dr Isabel Fletcher, senior researcher, Science Technology and Innovation Studies, University of Edinburgh; Social Farms & Gardens; The Vegan Society; Dung beetles for farmers; CLEAR – The Consortium on Labelling for the Environment, Animal welfare and Regenerative farming; Aldi; Bidfood; Co-op; Compass UK & Ireland; Food4innov8ions Ltd; Greencore; Greggs; Lidl GB; M&S; Perfectly Fresh Ltd; Sainsbury’s; Sodexo; Sysco GB; Tesco; Waitrose; Young’s Seafood      ",News/From the Observer,The ‘catastrophic’ effect of the Trojan Horse Affair | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2022/feb/27/letters-catastrophic-effect-trojan-horse-affair
2/27/2022,"The frightful noise of gunfire, bombing and children’s screams in the cities of Ukraine reverberates across Europe. The full-scale Russian invasion launched last week is an unprovoked, heinous crime perpetrated against Ukraine’s citizens, their sovereign democratic state and all the free peoples of the world. The 24th of February is a day that will live in infamy. It will not be forgiven. It will surely never be forgotten. Reports so far suggest Russia has failed to gain the swift victory it expected. Fierce street fighting in Kyiv and other cities speaks to the bravery of the country’s soldiers and ordinary Ukrainians determined to defend their land. In the east, the invaders are pinned down. But they are better equipped and armed. They have control in the air. If a thwarted Kremlin orders its forces to step up attacks, a bloodbath of Ukraine’s citizen fighters could ensue. At this moment of maximum danger, it’s imperative that Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president and sole architect of this needless calamity, implement an immediate ceasefire. Militarily, he has miscalculated. Diplomatically, he is isolated, as the UN security council’s condemnation of Moscow’s actions shows. Even his ally, China, refused to support this vile aggression. Politically, at home, Putin’s war is provoking widespread protests and unrest. Now is a time for cool heads and wise counsel in western capitals. The longer the fighting continues, the higher will be the number of people killed and maimed, the wider the political gulf and the greater the prospect that this conflict may spill into Poland and other nearby countries. As Nato reinforces its eastern flank and tensions rise across the board, the risk of confrontation between Russia and the western alliance grows. Help is urgently needed for Ukrainian families who are fleeing westwards in ever growing numbers to escape indiscriminate Russian attacks in civilian areas. Aid agencies predict a large-scale humanitarian and refugee emergency. Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Moldova and Romania cannot manage this terrible human crisis alone. Britain and all the EU countries must be generous in offering assistance and, hopefully temporary, asylum to Putin’s victims. The western democracies face a moment of truth. For years, they have watched the worldwide, polarising advance of authoritarianism. If the global order established after 1945 – guaranteeing the sovereign right to national self-determination, the rule of law and basic human rights – is not effectively defended now, then no individual, no people and no state will in future be safe from malign powers. Ukraine is democracy’s frontline. Grandiose pronouncements about epic watersheds and historic turning points in world affairs are often made and just as often wrong. But for once, this is no exaggeration. Not since Soviet tanks rolled into Prague in spring 1968 has Europe seen anything like this and not even that grimly remembered horror offers an exact analogy. Not since Hitler has Europe seen the leader of a major country behave in such predatory fashion. The attempted crushing – in truth, the attempted extinction – of an independent state and its freewheeling, multi-ethnic traditions by the stormtroopers of a delusional dictator inevitably recalls the Nazi era. How extraordinary, how barely believable, that Europe should be thrust back into that dark place. The sense of shock and outrage, not least in Russia, where 20 million people died in the fight against fascism, is palpable. How much greater still must be the bewilderment felt by European generations born after 1989, after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the cold war. Unlike baby boomers, they did not grow up in the shadow of nuclear Armageddon. How to explain that another aggrieved and angry little man – a contemptible KGB throwback who daily mourns the demise of the Soviet Union – is now threatening them with nuclear annihilation? In one sense, this moment has been coming ever since Putin cruelly suppressed Chechen separatists, levelling the city of Grozny in 1999-2000 without a thought for its inhabitants. In Georgia, in Syria and in Crimea and the Donbas in 2014, he repeatedly acted with similarly callous brutality and reckless disregard for consequences. His record is that of an international hooligan. Putin may or may not be crazy. But he is certainly a thug. Force is his only argument. Lies are his ammunition. He appears determined to transform Ukraine into a mere buffer, run by a puppet regime. US reports that the Kremlin has a list of public figures to be jailed or assassinated are credible. If Putin succeeds, he will build an open-air jail with torture chambers akin to benighted Belarus. Ukraine as an idea will cease to exist. Ukraine’s people, its leaders and its army know they are fighting for survival. So far, they are doing exceptionally well. They have slowed the advance, causing real damage to Russian forces. Stories abound of extraordinary individual courage and sacrifice. All men aged 18 to 60 have been called to arms and they willingly respond. Civilians have queued for guns and mixed molotov cocktails to throw at Russian tanks. The irony will probably be lost on Putin. All the same, logic and numbers suggest Ukrainians cannot indefinitely resist a significantly stronger enemy. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is demanding western military assistance while sympathetic Tory MPs propose a no-fly zone over Ukraine patrolled by UK and Nato aircraft. There is also talk of arming a semi-permanent, irregular resistance force. This is all highly problematic. As the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has said, a no-fly zone could lead to Nato clashes with Russian forces and a possible wider war. It is not a workable idea. More broadly, having insisted that Nato would not fight for a non-Nato country, the west has little choice but to stick to that position – even as pressure grows, as it certainly will, to protect Ukraine’s beleaguered people. This situation all but guarantees Putin’s superior forces will prevail in the near term. But that does not necessarily mean the bigger, longer battle is lost. It is not true to say, as Zelenskiy does, that Ukraine stands alone. The outpouring of support for Kyiv around the world is powerful. Putin is execrated on all sides. The US, UK and others are rightly upping the supply of defensive weapons. And then there are sanctions. The punitive measures imposed on Russia last week by the US, UK, EU and other countries are unprecedented in scope. Moscow has attempted to shrug them off. They will have little immediate impact. But as a concerted, collective exercise designed to isolate, degrade and eventually impoverish Russia’s economy, finances and Putin himself, it has no equal. That said, more could and should be done. It is wrong to exempt Russia’s oil and gas exports. Energy revenue is the regime’s main source of income. It pays for the wars it wages and the regressive policies it pursues. It keeps Putin in warm socks and luxury yachts. Of course, Europe will itself pay a high price if Russian energy is cut off. But it’s a price that must be paid. It is to be welcomed that Germany appears close to agreeing that Russian banks should be barred from the Swift payments system. These swingeing sanctions and the UN vote make it official: Putin’s Russia is a pariah state. If maintained and reinforced, as they must be over time, sanctions could help bring down his corrupt regime. Putin, plainly, has over-reached. This war and the limitless political and economic damage it will do to Russia may finally force an overdue reckoning between the Russian people and their oppressive president – and bring to a thankful end the shaming Putin era. Britain showed a lead in lobbying reluctant Germany and Italy over Swift, just as it has in ensuring defensive weaponry reaches Ukraine’s army. Promises by Boris Johnson and the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, to finally clean up the Russian dirty money laundromat in London, and penalise Putin’s oligarch pals, are welcome, if kept – though questions remain about Tory funding. The Ukraine crisis has undoubtedly boosted Johnson. By playing international statesman, he has dodged, for now, the mess he’s made at home. It’s heartening, meanwhile, to see Keir Starmer’s Labour back in the mainstream, standing four square behind Nato and vanquishing the pale ghosts of the Corbyn era. Unlike before the Iraq war, western intelligence assessments of Russia’s intentions have proved highly accurate. It remains the case, however, that post-Brexit Britain is a secondary player. The US president, Joe Biden, says the invasion marks the total rupture of western relations with Russia. This break has serious implications stretching beyond Ukraine to, for example, Taiwan, which fears China may emulate Putin. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, vulnerable former Soviet republics, and other east European states also worry they may be next – if Putin succeeds. He must not. It’s possible that the Ukraine crisis will shift the international balance of power and permanently remake the security map of Europe. But that’s a question for the future. Right now, it’s vital, as Johnson says, that Putin fails and be seen to fail. Right now, today, Ukrainians are dying in a vicious war of Russia’s choosing. Putin says he’s ready to talk. That’s a trap. The tyrant must understand: dialogue can only begin when the shooting stops.",Opinion/Opinion,The Observer view on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine | Observer editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/27/observer-view-russia-invasion-of-ukraine-vladimir-putin

2/27/2022,"Fletchers at Grantley Hall, Ripon, North Yorkshire, HG4 3ET (01765 620 070, grantleyhall.co.uk). Starters £12.50-£19.50, mains £24-£50, desserts £11.50-£14, wines from £34 I arrived at Grantley Hall on time for my booking, and still I was late for my table. That was because of the long drive from the front gates, through a huge pool-table baize of manicured lawns, to the car park. It was followed by the challenge of finding a space amid the Porsche and Tesla charging points. We then had to stride back through the car park pretending we belonged there, sweetly serenaded by the soft piano jazz being piped at us disconcertingly through the undergrowth. We went along the length of the mighty building, popped inside and through a padded cell of thickly carpeted, wood-panelled chambers to get to Fletchers, the hotel’s brasserie. Admittedly, we did pause to gawp at the display cases of mere fripperies available to purchase, including diamond-infested bracelets topping out at £9,295. Eventually, we got to the dining room. You get the point. Grantley Hall, a grand 17th-century Yorkshire pile, opened as a five-star hotel in 2019 and is over-engineered to within an inch of its gilded, primped and polished life. It belongs to Valeria Sykes, who invested £70m in the conversion after divorcing businessman and Brexit donor Paul Sykes. Facilities include a pool, snow and steam rooms, a gym, a chamber for altitude training, an underwater treadmill, a cryotherapy chamber – nope, me neither – and a 3D body scanner that can check bone density. Who needs a digestif when you can have your bone density investigated after lunch instead? I am aware that all this comes across as reverse snobbery; as a performative sneer at the excesses of the overly moneyed. Terrific. That’s the intention. Grantley Hall is hilariously over the top. It’s where any reasonable perspective on life goes to die. It houses a bunch of restaurants, including a faux après-ski café, which doubtless Yorkshire has long been desperate for, as well as a joint fusing “Yorkshire produce and Far Eastern flavours”. Then there’s the flagship restaurant of Shaun Rankin, formerly of Ormer, which offers a 10-course tasting menu each evening at £130 a head and which has so far been represented by three different PR companies. All of them have encouraged me to go. No thanks. I was much more interested in the brasserie, partly because it’s the place you’d actually go to eat the rest of the time if you were staying at the hotel, and partly because I like to imagine Fletchers was named after Ronnie Barker’s character in Porridge. I assume it isn’t, though I could find nothing on the website explaining the name. I did, however, find a neat little bit of coding by the web designer: the tab in Chrome for the restaurant page reads “Best places to Eat in Yorkshire”. I won’t lie. I’m not entirely convinced that’s true. It’s not a bad restaurant. The staff are cheery, despite being forced to wear name badges like it’s a Harvester. And we can all enjoy a bit of mock Scottish baronial. There’s some tartan padding on the chairs. An open fire gutters. But the whole venture is both confused and asphyxiatingly expensive for what it is. Then again, that cryotherapy chamber isn’t going to pay for itself, is it? The dishes read like somebody once stopped outside the Wolseley in London and had a quick shufti of their menu, without bothering to actually eat there. At first it all seems to be designed to comfort and feed rather than to astonish you. Then again, the £25.50 charged for the beer-battered fish with an actual Jenga of chips, might well achieve both at the same time. You can have smoked salmon sandwiches at lunchtime for £16.50, or a chicken salad with avocado and gem lettuce for £21. Much of the rest of it is, however, detailed and precise and just exhaustingly fussy. A single smoked haddock and spring onion fish cake for £14.50 arrives ringed by a neurotic circle of herb oil that appears to be there only for framing rather than flavour. There’s an honour guard of vinegared anchovies placed just so over the top and a perfect disc of very good tartare sauce underneath. The fish cake itself is heavy on the potato, light on the fish. In another starter, a breast of pigeon is beautifully cooked, but the plate is splattered rather than sauced, and it looks like someone has used a centimetre ruler to carve the cubes of underwhelming black pudding. So it continues. I can admire the technique in the cooking of a piece of venison loin, or the zip of the braised red cabbage beneath. Quite right, too, at £32. But why announce a faggot and then present something so lacking in visceral shout? A good faggot should be literally gutsy. This one seems ashamed of itself. A plate of stone bass with squid, braised fennel, saffron and fennel purée and a red pepper butter sauce reads like a love letter to the French Mediterranean coast; it tastes like it was cooked by someone who went there on their holidays, but didn’t enjoy it at all. The flavours are restrained and muted. Still, there’s always the chips. Curiously, they remind me of the ones in the bag at the bottom of my freezer. Tough trick to pull off, that. And then the desserts arrive. Oh boy. They are brilliant; some of the very best examples of detailed patisserie work it has been my pleasure to experience in a long time. A paper-thin, white-chocolate cuff encloses the lightest of sponges, topped by a rhubarb crémeux, in turn enclosing a silky rhubarb gel; a chocolate and stout cake comes layered with various ethereal mousses inside a perfect dark-chocolate cylinder. It’s accompanied by a dome of chocolate ganache and a biscuit sandwich enclosing an Irish cream frozen parfait. Both these astonishing desserts cost around £13. I can’t begrudge a penny of it. They feel like dishes from an entirely different restaurant; one that knows what it wants to be and how to deliver that. As I’ve already said, this review is thickly buttered with snark. I think it’s reasonable. Our bill for three courses with no wine is just shy of £150 and while we come out singing a hymn of praise to the desserts, we only mutter irritably about the rest of it. Ah well. It’s something to get us through the long journey ahead of us; the one all the way back to the front gate. The ever-restless chef and restaurateur Gary Usher of north west-based Elite Bistros has announced plans to crowdfund £2m by selling shares in the company. Previous crowdfunders, used to launch new restaurants, have offered rewards, including meals and merchandise. The new funds, he says, will finance the opening of three further restaurants to go alongside the likes of Sticky Walnut, Wreckfish, Burnt Truffle and Hispi. He also says he has plans for a tapas-style restaurant (elitebistros.com). Fresh from becoming the first restaurant in Wales to be awarded two Michelin stars, chef-patron Gareth Ward of Ynyshir in Machynlleth, Powys, has announced he is to open his own pub. Once planning approval is given it will be built on land behind the restaurant and, he told industry magazine The Caterer, should be open by the end of the year. ‘The overheads are massive at Ynyshir,’ he said, ‘And the land will help pay its way.’ (ynyshir.co.uk). The full hospitality business Covid numbers are in. Industry body UKHospitality has calculated that the restaurant sector lost around £115bn in sales during 2020 and 2021 as a result of the pandemic. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of the organisation, is calling on the government to keep VAT for hospitality at 12.5% rather than return it to 20%, to help the sector recover.

2/27/2022,"Donald Trump last week launched his long-awaited social media app, Truth Social, luring users with the promises of a platform free from “discrimination against political ideology”. But with tech glitches plaguing the platform and early criticisms of its content policies the rollout is already raising questions about its future. Even though social media was instrumental to his rise, Trump for years had accused platforms like Facebook, Twitter and others of censorship. In 2021, he was permanently removed from most major sites for his role in inciting the insurrection at the Capitol. In response, he promised to launch his own firm, establishing Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) and positioning his new company as a champion of free speech. “Our main goal here is to give people their voice back,” said former Republican US congressman Devin Nunes, who became TMTG’s president earlier this year, adding that the app offers “the opposite of some Silicon Valley tech oligarch freak telling people what they want to think and deciding who can or cannot be on the platform.” But experts say Trump’s new venture faces an uphill battle to attract users in a crowded field, and is looking at mounting regulatory issues. Truth Social had been available to some users in a test phase since early last week, and became available to the general public in Apple’s App store late Sunday night. The app quickly became the top-downloaded free social networking app. But even as it rose in popularity, it ran up against a number of tech setbacks. Early users reported receiving error messages when attempting to create accounts. Many of those who were ultimately able to register reported they were not able to actually enter the app, being told they had been placed on a waitlist of hundreds of thousands of people. Others reported the app’s “terms of service” page was down and the company confirmed that on Monday it experienced a 13-hour partial outage related to “application launch traffic”. As of Wednesday morning, Trump’s account on Truth Social had just under 50,000 followers, according to the New York Times. Users on Thursday reported being told they were 600,000th in line to join. Nunes told reporters that the app would be “fully operational” in the US by the end of March, several months behind the launch date the former president had put forth when announcing the platform. To observers, the delay and technological challenges did not come as a surprise. “Since Trump wants to run for office again, the timeline of the app is driven by political objectives – not by readiness of the platform,” said Jennifer Grygiel, a professor of communications at Syracuse University. Truth Social has been pegged as an attempt by Trump to reclaim the massive power of his social media empire of the past. The former president, when he was removed from Twitter, had a direct line to speak to his 88 millon followers. At his height, a single tweet from Trump could launch a cable news cycle, and move the stock market. Trump’s “first post” on Truth Social read “Get Ready! Your favorite President will see you soon!” But whether his new platform will provide him the megaphone he seeks remains to be seen. Truth Social will need to go toe-to-toe with bigger social media players like Facebook and Twitter, which have had years to build up loyal bases. Meanwhile, newer “free speech” startups including Parler, MeWe, Gettr, and Rumble are crowding the field and competing for a similar pool of social media users. The user base of those platforms, and the one Trump is eying, seeks partisan feeds, but such activity may not actually be good for business, said Paul Barrett, deputy director at New York University’s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. “A big part of Trump’s appeal on social media is conflict,” he said. “The right wing often goes back to this idea of ‘owning the libs’ – well, there are not going to be any libs to own on Truth Social, which begs the question, why is this going to be interesting?” Others have pointed out that the supposed main selling point Truth Social – that it is an anti-censorship alternative to “mainstream” media – doesn’t hold up to scrutiny. These skeptics point to the app’s terms of service – which, according to Mike Masnick of Techdirt, imply the site will be “one of the most aggressive in moderating content”. In its rules, Truth Social promises to take down any content that is “false, inaccurate, or misleading” and says users need to “have the written consent, release, and/or permission of each and every identifiable individual person” in every post. Truth Social may face additional challenges. The platform shows an eerie resemblance to Twitter, with a nearly identical layout but different labels, swapping terms like “truths” for “tweets” and “re-truths” for “retweets”. Time for some Truth!!! pic.twitter.com/jvyteDb5gW Twitter declined to comment about whether it planned to pursue any action against Truth Social for copyright infringement. Trump Media also has to confront financial and regulatory hurdles to access millions of dollars in funding. In 2021 it announced a merger with Digital World Acquisition Corp (DWAC), a special purpose acquisition company, through which it stands to receive $293m in cash. But the merger is stalled pending scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the US Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. TMTG raised an additional $1bn from private investors, which also will not be available until the DWAC deal closes – which could be months away, according to regulatory filings. Those mergers and deals have led some to say that Truth Social, like many Trump ventures in the past, is simply a shameless money grab. “Everything Trump does has a grifter angle to it,” Barett said. “We all may be spinning our wheels wondering about how the app is to affect Trump politically, or as a potential vehicle for his reconquering social media, when he just may be in it for a quick profit.”",News/US news,Truth Social: will Trump’s ‘free speech haven’ overcome its rocky start?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/26/donald-trump-truth-social-launch
