4/15/2022,"Around the age of 11, I came close to being on Jim’ll Fix It. I was keen on cricket and my dad wrote to the Saturday-evening TV show asking if I could spend a day practising with the world-beating West Indies team, who were touring England at the time. The producers were apparently keen on the idea but in the end, the West Indies’ busy schedule prevented Jim from Fixing It for me. This would almost certainly have been a treasured childhood memory. But now, it feels more like a narrow escape. Watching Netflix’s Jimmy Savile: A British Horror Story, it’s impossible not to reflect upon the meaning of Savile, his place in recent British culture, and the impact – ostensibly benign then suddenly, corrosively toxic – that he had on so many lives. Rowan Deacon’s documentary has clearly been made for a worldwide audience. But the backstory is so detailed that it’s surprisingly illuminating, even if you are already broadly familiar with these events. This points to an essential truth about Britain’s collective relationship with Savile. Savile groomed and gaslit not just his victims but an entire culture. And he did this incrementally, over an incredibly long period. As a result, while it was happening, very few people processed how deeply abnormal it was. So what transpired after his death in 2011 was, for many, like being shaken rudely awake after a long, disturbing dream. In hospitals, in remand homes, in his various residences and god knows where else, Jimmy Savile had been sexually abusing children, for decades, on an almost industrial scale. Of course he had. Deep down, so many people knew this. The astonishingly brave testimony of Samantha Brown – one of Savile’s victims – in A British Horror story is an unbearably vivid evocation of the misery he caused. For several decades, Jimmy Savile was everywhere. He DJ-ed on “the nation’s favourite” radio station, BBC Radio 1. He presented Top of the Pops, the virtual musical watercooler around which about a third of the country gathered every Thursday evening. He ran the London Marathon for charity. He was onstage at concerts, introducing the Beatles or the Stones. You would see him glad-handing Prince Charles or Margaret Thatcher. And, of course, he made children’s dreams come true every Saturday teatime. This, obviously, was part of the plan. Savile was covering all bases. And the sad thing is, as the film reminds us, Jim’ll Fix It – where children’s dreams were helped to come true on national television – was a brilliant idea for a TV show. There’s a genuinely charming clip in episode one of the documentary where a schoolboy takes his favourite teacher out for afternoon tea at a fancy restaurant. Another goes on the set of Star Trek and, eyes wide with wonder, meets Captain Kirk. These moments were, it turns out, simply the bulwarks of child abuse. It’s now impossible to separate them from what Savile did. In the UK’s pre-internet days, where there were only three TV channels, the UK’s national broadcaster did a lot of heavy lifting on behalf of the inner life of the nation. As per the injunction of its founder, Lord Reith, the BBC was supposed to inform, educate and entertain – after all, there were fewer options back then. Children of the 70s and 80s are familiar with cultural scarcity. But they are familiar with cultural collectivity too – the experiences that the BBC helped the UK to share at that time. Not for nothing was it nicknamed “Auntie”. But it’s harder to think of the BBC in those terms now. As the film emphasises, the burying of Meirion Jones and Liz MacKean’s initial Savile exposé is one of the most shameful episodes in the BBC’s history. But the horror, finally, is more abstract, more philosophical in nature. Eventually, it always circles back to matters of power and trust; the trust children place in adults, the trust the BBC placed in Savile, and the trust and power conferred upon the BBC. In the film’s plentiful archive footage, Savile is constantly surrounded by young women and children. A few are interviewed as adults and when they watch clips of themselves, it’s possible to sense their confusion. They’re momentarily thrilled to see their younger selves on TV. They smile. Then, they remember. Savile’s insistent and coercive lasciviousness is constant, blatant and revolting. Every touch – and, trigger warning, there are many touches in this documentary – now feels like a violation. He’s a huge star and he’s doing this because he can. He reduces everyone in his orbit to the status of a supplicant. And really, everyone was. Every kid either watching or participating in Savile’s Saturday evening light-entertainment Trojan horse was hopelessly under his spell. In the context of everything we now know, the power imbalance is grotesque beyond words – and so are the implications of it. To watch this documentary is to be reminded that Jimmy Savile made many of Britain’s childhood memories. Then, he made a whole country desperately want to forget them.",Arts/Television & radio, The awful truth of Netflix’s Jimmy Savile documentary: he gaslit an entire nation,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/14/netflix-jimmy-savile-a-british-horror-story-documentary
4/15/2022,"What was the last genuinely great thing to happen in the Premier League? That’s right! The answer has nothing whatsoever to do with last Sunday’s well-received encounter between Manchester City and Liverpool, and everything to do with five years ago, when Chelsea put paid to Tottenham’s chances of winning the title and everyone disappeared down the Stamford Bridge tunnel throwing hands. And the time before that? It’d be Martin Keown getting right up in Ruud van Nistelrooy’s grille. And before that? Eric Cantona disappearing into the Selhurst Park stands to dispense beneficial advice on race relations. All of these incidents were met with the usual performative wagging of fingers, but deep down everyone really knows what’s what. Similarly this week in Big Cup. Sure, Chelsea played out a marvellous ding-dong match at the Bernabéu, while Liverpool simultaneously proved against Benfica why they almost certainly will win and have absolutely no chance of winning the competition. But all of this pales in comparison with the geometrically perfect cartoon cloud drawn on Wednesday night by the artists of Atlético Madrid and Manchester City, which, for maximum comic effect, had fists and boots sticking out of it in all the correct Beano-approved places. Oof! Ooyah! Oof! As modern brouhahas go – nothing’s ever going to top Chile v Italy in the 1962 World Cup, The Fiver isn’t completely daft – it was brilliant, registering a top score of 11 on our We Don’t Like To See It But We Do-o-meter. Depending on your point of view, the most committed contribution to the entertainment was perpetrated either by Felipe, who hacked down then aimed a sly kick at Phil Foden; Foden, who cynically rolled back on to the field of play in the clock-management style; or Stefan Savic, who tried to drag Foden to his feet, stuck the nut on Raheem Sterling, and pulled Jack Grealish, who had called him an effing cee, by the hair. All good clean wholesome family fun, and yes, it was mainly Savic, wasn’t it, and him a former Citizen too. After everyone cooled down – and to this end, someone had helpfully thrown some liquid at Pep Guardiola – City could bask in the knowledge of a job well done. “Today we celebrate because it is the third time in Manchester City’s history we are in the [Big Cup] semi-finals,” the City boss said. However he added that “we are in big trouble”, with Kevin De Bruyne and Kyle Walker having gone off knacked. Saturday’s FA Cup semi with Liverpool may come around too soon for the pair, but at least they’ve got a couple of weeks to get fit for the first leg of their Big Cup semi against Real Madrid, which we definitely, absolutely, categorically do not want to see descend into another spectacular, bench-emptying, life-affirming donnybrook.

Scotland’s Human Rights World Cup play-off semi-final at home to Ukraine has been rescheduled for 1 June, with the final against Wales on 5 June. Arsenal fans have called for the club to cancel its sponsorship by the Rwandan government after the UK government’s absolute-state-of-it agreement to send migrants to the African country. The endorsement is reported to be worth £10m a year to Arsenal. Northern Ireland Women captain Marissa Callaghan has spoken up in support of manager Kenny Shiels after those comments. “Collectively we stand by our manager,” she said. “We feel his interview was in relation to a meeting we had as a team where we analysed that we concede goals in quick succession and emotions was one of the many things we discussed.

4/15/2022,"Rwanda, Priti Patel’s planned destination for the processing of migrants arriving in the UK, is a largely rural east African country whose authoritarian president, Paul Kagame, has been accused of seeking to assassinate opponents. The mountainous and landlocked country of 12 million, which witnessed an appalling genocide in 1994 in which 800,000 people were killed in 100 days, has been a recipient of generous development aid in the decades since. Kagame has been feted by supporters in the west for his role in ending the genocide and for reducing poverty, though some critics have questioned the statistics. But his leadership has come under increased scrutiny in recent years, especially over accusations that he orchestrated the kidnapping and murdering of his political opponents in order to eliminate challengers to his rule – accusations he denies. One of Kagame’s most prominent alleged victims was his former intelligence chief Patrick Karegeya, who was strangled in a hotel room while living in exile in South Africa in 2014. Rwanda’s former army chief of staff Kayumba Nyamwasa – who also went into exile in South Africa – has survived two assassination attempts blamed on Kagame. More recently Rwanda was accused of kidnapping the opposition figure Paul Rusesabagina from Dubai and subjecting him to what critics said was a “show trial”. Rusesabagina, whose lifesaving actions during the genocide were depicted in the film Hotel Rwanda, was sentenced to 25 years in prison in September after being convicted of terrorism offences by a court in Rwanda’s capital, Kigali. The US state department said it was “concerned” over the “fairness of the verdict”. In July last year the Guardian reported that Rusesabagina’s daughter, Carine Kanimba, had been spied on using Pegasus malware developed by the Israeli company NSO. The British police have warned Kagame critics living in the UK that their lives may be in danger. Despite well-documented concerns about Rwanda’s human rights record, Kagame has long enjoyed vigorous support from UK politicians – from the Conservative and Labour parties. Rwanda’s record in hosting refugees from DRC has in the past come under scrutiny. In 2018, Rwandan police killed 12 refugees after a demonstration outside the offices of the United Nations high commissioner for refugees in Karongi district. Rwanda’s previous involvement in receiving African deportees from Israel raises serious concerns over whether – even with the UK’s reported £20m funding – it has the resources or even willingness to host deportations. Of about 4,000 people estimated to have been deported by Israel to Rwanda and Uganda under a “voluntary departure” scheme between 2014 and 2017, almost all are thought to have left the country almost immediately, with many attempting to return to Europe via people-smuggling routes. In addition, at least one deportee still in Rwanda, tracked down by Israel’s Haaretz newspaper in 2018, described being destitute and living on the streets of Rwanda’s capital, Kigali. Clouded in secrecy, and with Rwanda officially denying its involvement, details of the arrangement with Israel and the fate of some of those deported have been described in several reports, some of which included testimony from those who said they had been sent to Rwanda. Critics at the time, including the rights group Amnesty International, also pointed out that Israel had a far smaller number of refugees than Rwanda, and was a much wealthier country. Amnesty accused Israel of “foisting its responsibility on countries who have only a fraction of the wealth and resources”. A report by the International Refugee Rights Initiative interviewed a number of individuals who said they had been deported from Israel to Rwanda. Testimonies collected by IRRI suggested “that the majority, if not all, are being smuggled out of the country by land to Kampala [in Uganda] within days of arriving in Kigali. “They are not given an opportunity to apply for asylum, and even if they wish to stay in Rwanda, their refugee claims cannot be assessed as the national refugee status determination committee has not yet been established. Among the very few deported from Israel voluntarily who did opt to stay was a 28-year-old Eritrean man named Goitom, who spoke to Haaretz newspaper in Kigali in 2018. He had not been allowed to work and was living on the streets. “Things are so bad. I am living very badly. I have no home, there is no work,” he told the paper. “Before, there were a few people who helped me. The United Nations also helped – they gave me money for lodging and food. But they stopped.”",News/World news,Rwanda: human rights fears in nation whose leader faces murder claims,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/rwanda-human-rights-fears-paul-kagame
4/15/2022,"Alittle student loans news, why not? The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) recently pointed out that some students and graduates in England will be paying up to 12% interest on their loans from September, before a rate dip in March 2023 that will precipitate a (for now, anyway) interest cap. This huge, short-term spike in costs comes not long after changes to the whole system were announced, increasing the time over which graduates pay back their loans from 30 to 40 years, and lowering the repayment threshold. Forty years of debt in exchange for “learning English, but a bit more” seems fairly disproportionate to me, though perhaps that is now the point. Whenever something like this happens – a huge student finance machination that inevitably makes the decision about whether to go to university or not more fraught than ever, and it happens every few years like clockwork – I do wonder what the endgame to all this is. Do we want to price smart people out from getting smarter for ever? Do we want everyone to be in debt for ever? Is this the society we want to live in? Well, apparently, yes. One of the problems here is that everyone in their 30s or older carries about their own deeply held and outdated opinions about students, with the result that no one seems to actually care what they’re going through right now. Those opinions tend to fall into three categories. First, you yourself did not go to university and still got on fine, in which case you think students are workshy dilettantes who need a humiliating day of hard graft to sort them out (this is fine, you are allowed to think this). Another strand of thinking is not anti-learning exactly, but anti-student, very much stuck in the late-80s Ben-Elton-and-Viz idea of students, where they are always wearing very embarrassing hats and being right on. We don’t like politics that involves empathy in this country, so that has a big constituency. The third and I think most important way of thinking about students is as this enormous, soul-engulfing self-cringe: you remember how unbearable you personally were as a student – you wore that charity-shop suit jacket everywhere! You idiot! – and you want to prevent modern students from making the same personality mistakes you did, and the only way you can justify that is by saddling them with decades of debt. Realistically, I do back this one. I wouldn’t choose to financially support the 20-year-old version of me, either. He slept in jeans and ate Pot Noodles for breakfast. A sordid little boy. But without those three years of university, I simply would not have blossomed into the long-paragraph genius you delight in reading today, and within these student loan debacles the fact that a university education is very often just a good thing in itself seems to get lost among the newspeak of “it’s just graduate tax” and “how else would you pay for it?”. Some people become the best version of themselves through university, others flourish best when they go straight into a trade, and some people find their feet in the bobbing waters of the workplace. There are a lot of people who fall through the gaps between those broad options but for the most part, university works for those who go. And yet we seem actively determined in England to make it as expensive and off-putting an experience as possible. It’s now no longer just three years of making bolognese in a wok, having a short and intense friendship with a French girl, pound-a-pint night, and writing essays in the cool dark fog of the night. Now the decision you might make at 17 about university has to matter, every single ounce of it; the entire thing has become a lifelong mortgage calculation in which your future self is in the balance. Nice two As and a B at A-level you’ve got there … it would be a shame if the only viable way to do anything with them is to take on tens of thousands of pounds of ever-growing debt, which we change the terms on as and when we want to. This won’t be the last student loan disaster and it isn’t yet the most significant, but it will be a footnote on the eventual Wikipedia page about how the whole higher education system in England collapsed while Nick Clegg watched on from California in VR goggles. In the past few years, the politics of England has become an ever sharper war between the old, who did fine, and the young who never really will, and this sort of unthinking generational punishment is just par for the course now. A reminder if you haven’t dipped into the hell of the job market recently: you need a degree just to qualify for an entry-level job doing filing in a bleakly lit office in any major city in the UK. How about we change that? If not, we’ll just move ever closer to a system where only the 7,000-odd graduates from Oxford and Cambridge every year are ever allowed to do anything, and the rest of us can just till the fields.

4/15/2022,"Opposition politicians in Rwanda have criticised its agreement to accept thousands of unauthorised asylum seekers flown from the UK, saying wealthy western countries should “own up to international obligations on the migration issues”. Victoire Ingabire Umuhoza, the leader of DALFA-Umurinzi, said officials in Rwanda should focus on solving its political and social issues that made Rwandans seek refuge abroad before offering “to host refugees or migrants from other countries”. A second opposition party, the officially recognised Democratic Green party of Rwanda (PVDR), said wealthy countries such as the UK “should not shift their international obligation to receive refugees and transfer them to third countries” just because they had “the money to influence and enforce their will”. “Rwanda has already a high population destiny … and already land is not sufficient for us all, with a lot of land conflicts and competition for the natural resources,” the PVDR said. “Taking on migrants from UK will increase the land burden and survival challenges for the limited natural resources available.” Rwanda produced refugees too, said Ingabire. “These include Rwandan people who sought political and economic asylum in other countries. Such conditions do not in fact guarantee long term security in Rwanda and in the Great Lakes region.“Rwanda has consistently ranked one of the world’s safest nations but at the same time consistently a country where its inhabitants are unhappy.”Ingabire was jailed for five years on what supporters say were politically motivated charges after returning to Rwanda to contest elections in 2010. She said the British and Rwandan governments’ argument that relocating people to Rwanda would address inequalities that drove people from their homes was not credible. The Rwandan president, Paul Kagame, is a divisive figure. He is credited with the development and stability Rwanda has experienced since the genocide in 1994, but he is also accused of intolerance towards any criticism, whether domestic or international. Kagame won a third term in power, with 98% of the vote, at elections in 2017. Opposition politicians in Rwanda face systematic harassment, arrest and detention by its security services. Some critics have challenged the country’s much-lauded economic record. “Inequality is on the rise in Rwanda … Despite the praise it received internationally for its development, the Covid-19 pandemic has further exposed the shortcomings of Rwanda economic progress, especially in those areas needed for Rwanda to achieve genuine social and economic transformation for the wider population,” Ingabire said.In October, nine people linked to DALFA-Umurinzi and a journalist were detained in crackdown on opponents and critics that seemed to be prompted by an event, “Ingabire Day”, which was organised by the unregistered opposition party to discuss political repression in Rwanda.",News/World news,Rwandan opposition criticises deal to accept UK’s asylum seekers,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/rwandan-opposition-criticises-deal-to-accept-uks-asylum-seekers
4/15/2022,"Oscar-nominated actor Frank Langella has exited Netflix series The Fall of the House of Usher after an investigation into misconduct. According to the Hollywood Reporter and Deadline, the 84-year-old star of Frost/Nixon was found to have “been involved in unacceptable conduct on set”. The series, which was midway through production, is based on the works of Edgar Allan Poe. A spokesperson for Netflix has confirmed to the Guardian that the report is accurate. The investigation reportedly started after Langella was accused of making inappropriate comments to a female co-star. The actor was not scheduled to be on set this week and shooting will continue with scenes not involving his character until the role is recast. Langella was cast to play Roderick Usher, a role previously played by Vincent Price in the 1960 film House of Usher, alongside Carla Gugino, Mark Hamill and Mary McDonnell. The series comes from Mike Flanagan, whose work includes The Haunting of Hill House, Midnight Mass and Doctor Sleep. He has referred to the series as “an epic tale of greed, horror, and tragedy”. Langella was nominated for an Oscar for playing Richard Nixon in Frost/Nixon and his most recent roles have included Judge Julius Hoffman in Aaron Sorkin’s The Trial of the Chicago 7 and Seb in the Showtime series Kidding.

4/15/2022,"Goldman Sachs bankers saw their pay and benefits fall by nearly a third in the first quarter, as the end of the investment banking boom contributed to a near halving of profits. The Wall Street lender said it had put aside nearly $4.1bn (£3bn) to cover the costs of compensating staff over the first three months of the year – an average of $91,116 each for its approximately 43,900 global employees. The pay pot, which covers salaries, pensions and benefits as well as the best estimate of bonuses that Goldman intends to pay at the end of the year, was down 32% from $6bn a year earlier. Banker bonuses are expected to fall this year as the investment banking boom, sparked by the gradual easing of Covid lockdown measures last year, starts to wane. It comes as fewer firms raise money on the financial markets and hold back from mergers and takeovers, which together helped push investment banking fees and bank profits to record highs throughout 2021. But investment banks have experienced a drop in demand this year, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which rattled global markets and made companies more cautious about launching deals and fundraising. “It was a turbulent quarter dominated by the devastating invasion of Ukraine” said David Solomon, Goldman’s chief executive. “The rapidly evolving market environment had a significant effect on client activity,” he added. It contributed to a 42% drop in profits in the first quarter to nearly $4bn, down from $6.8bn a year earlier. Revenues tumbled 27% to just under $13bn due to “significantly lower” income from its asset management and investment banking divisions. The bank was also hit by an increase in loan loss provisions, having put aside $561m to cover potential defaults linked to a surge in credit card customers, as well as the impact of the war in Ukraine. That is compared with the release of $70m last year, as banks realised they had put aside too much cash to cushion the blow of potential defaults linked to the Covid crisis. Meanwhile Citigroup reported a 46% drop in first quarter profits to $4.3bn, and said that the current economic environment had also impacted its investment banking income.",News/Business,Goldman Sachs pay falls by a third and profits slump as investment boom ends,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/14/goldman-sachs-pay-falls-by-a-third-and-profits-slump-as-investment-boom-ends
4/15/2022,"A teachers’ union is forming a partnership with education experts to “critically interrogate” the government’s plans for a model history curriculum in England, as its leaders warned that culture wars continued to rage over what should be taught in classrooms. Mary Bousted, a joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said it was joining with the Runnymede Trust and others to monitor the history curriculum changes the government has announced as part of its response to the Sewell report on race and ethnic disparities. “We want to ensure that Black history, cultures and perspectives have proper recognition in all subjects and all year round. And this must centre the perspectives of those who were colonised or their descendants,” Bousted told delegates at the NEU’s annual conference in Bournemouth. The Department for Education plans to develop a model history curriculum for use by schools by 2024, with the help of “experts, historians and school leaders”. Ministers have sought to reassure critics that the curriculum would be diverse in a “meaningful, rather than tokenistic” way. Bousted said she had been “monstered” by the rightwing media and endured “gales of outrage” on social media after saying she was not interested in a curriculum solely composed of the works of dead white men. “All of which shows me, personally, and us all, politically, that the culture wars rage and continue to rage and that they consume anyone who dares to challenge the narrow, monocultural base on which the current national curriculum, with all its assumptions on powerful knowledge is based,” Bousted said. The partnership with the Runnymede Trust and other education experts would “act as a point of critical interrogation” of the government’s planned changes, Bousted said. At its annual conference the union’s delegates earlier passed motions calling for a campaign to decolonialise school curriculums. The UK Statistics Authority said it was investigating the DfE’s use of statistics in its schools white paper, after the NEU’s leaders announced the union had made a formal complaint. Kevin Courtney, the NEU’s other joint general secretary, said the union had complained to the statistics watchdog “about this disgraceful, deliberate misuse of statistics and the deliberate suppression of relevant data” in the DfE’s documents to support its claim that converting local authority schools into academies improved their Ofsted grades. Bousted pledged to defeat the government’s aim of all state schools in England being converted to academies by 2030, calling the white paper “the final thrashings of zombie education ideologues with zombie education policies”.",News/Education,Teachers’ union NEU warns of classroom culture wars,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/14/teachers-union-neu-warns-of-classroom-culture-wars
4/15/2022,"It turns out he wasn’t in “goblin mode” after all. Last week Elon Musk, in his characteristically antic manner, tweeted a series of suggestions for improving Twitter after he was revealed to have become its largest individual shareholder. They ranged from asking if the site’s HQ should be turned into a homeless shelter to whether advertising should be removed from the platform’s premium service. Many of these tweets were subsequently deleted, including one sharing a meme depicting the attorney Saul Goodman from the series Breaking Bad with the words: “In all fairness your honor, my client was in ‘goblin mode.’” Whether Musk was being mischievous or not at the time – it’s hard to tell with the world’s richest person – we have to take those tweets very seriously now that he has offered more than $40bn (£30bn) to buy the microblogging site. Given Twitter’s pivotal role in shaping the news and political agenda on both sides of the Atlantic, its ownership is a sensitive issue, particularly if it is about to be placed in the hands of an entrepreneur with a $260bn fortune. Not only is Musk one of the site’s most popular accounts with 81.6 million followers, he is the CEO of two companies – the electric carmaker Tesla and the rocket firm SpaceX – that intersect with the regulatory and political spheres. “The Beltway and EU will have a field day with this,” said Dan Ives of the US investment firm Wedbush Securities. “Musk owning Twitter is a nightmare for many and this will go through regulatory scrutiny on both sides of the pond.” Nonetheless, Ives doesn’t see rival bidders trumping Musk’s $54.20-a-share bid. Musk has a lot of money and a 9.2% stake, giving him a strong position as the Twitter board – which he declined to join at the weekend – ponders its next move. Change is on the cards if he succeeds. Musk said in a letter to the board on Thursday that Twitter is “the platform for free speech around the world” but cannot achieve this “societal imperative” in its current form and “needs to be transformed as a private company”. His main concern appears to be with Twitter’s moderation policies. In March he tweeted a poll asking users whether the site adhered to the principle of free speech. “Given that Twitter serves as the de facto public town square, failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy,” he said. “What should be done?” He has declared himself a “free speech absolutist” and, in that context, the Twitter-banned former US president Donald Trump must be hoping Musk’s bid succeeds. However, the regulatory environment for social media is getting ever tougher. In the UK, the forthcoming online safety bill will require the platforms to monitor their content closely for harms such as pile-ons (one of Twitter’s nastier phenomena). Even if the site is under private ownership, it will not be able to swerve legislators on both sides of the Atlantic who want to make the internet a safer place. Other suggestions from Musk are less contentious. Last week he asked users if they wanted an edit button to rewrite posts after launching, prompting the company to confirm it was working on such a function anyway. He also mooted changes to the premium service, Twitter Blue, such as removing advertising, which raises the prospect of a radical commercial departure for a business that makes 90% of its $5bn annual revenue from ads. Investors’ main concern with Twitter is growth, in terms of advertising revenue and subscribers, with the likes of TikTok providing fierce competition for users’ attention. Given Musk’s emphasis on freedom of speech, presumably user growth will come into focus if the company ends up under his ownership. According to Twitter’s latest quarterly results, daily active users rose by 25 million over the year to 217 million as the company stuck to its target of 315 million by the end of next year. The drama of the last week should have added a few more users and, given the likely hurdles Musk needs to clear before he wins control of the business, the platform is in no danger of losing its relevance yet.",News/Technology,How ‘free speech absolutist’ Elon Musk would transform Twitter,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/14/how-free-speech-absolutist-elon-musk-would-transform-twitter
