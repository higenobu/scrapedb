5/20/2022,"A SpaceX flight attendant accused Musk of exposing himself and propositioning her for sex in late 2016, Insider found. Around that time, he was divorcing Talulah Riley and dating Amber Heard. He was also planning for Tesla to build solar roofs and coming up with The Boring Company. Elon Musk was finalizing a divorce, dating the actress Amber Heard, and developing The Boring Company around the time he was said to have exposed himself and sexually propositioned a SpaceX flight attendant. An Insider investigation by Rich McHugh, published Thursday, found that the flight attendant accused Musk of exposing his erect penis, touching her leg, and offering to give her a horse in exchange for a sexual favor in late 2016. She declined his proposition, per documents and interviews procured by Insider. At the time, Musk was in the middle of divorce proceedings with the actress Talulah Riley. It was their second split: Musk announced their divorce in 2012, and the couple remarried in 2013. Musk then filed for divorce from Riley in December 2014, then withdrew the paperwork seven months later. In 2016, their relationship ended for good, with their divorce finalized that October. That year Musk was also rumored to be dating Heard, whom he met and bonded with at the Met Gala in May 2016. More details about Musk and Heard's yearlong relationship recently emerged in the course of the latter's high-profile defamation trial against her ex, Johnny Depp. According to Heard's therapist, the actress ""felt nothing"" and her ""soul was dead"" when she started dating Musk several weeks after splitting with Depp. In October 2016, Musk also announced that Tesla was planning to develop solar roofs. A month later, Tesla closed on its acquisition of Musk's cousins' company, SolarCity — a landmark deal that later landed Musk in a $2 billion lawsuit from Tesla's shareholders, which he won in April 2022. And in December 2016, Musk came up with the idea of The Boring Company. He tweeted on December 17 that year: ""Traffic is driving me nuts. Am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging..."" ""It shall be called 'The Boring Company,'"" Musk tweeted. According to Insider's investigation, SpaceX in 2018 paid the flight attendant $250,000 in exchange for her silence about the allegation. Musk told Insider that there is ""a lot more to this story"" and on Friday morning called the accusations ""utterly untrue."" He also called the story ""politically motivated hit piece.""

5/20/2022,"By Casey Hall SHANGHAI (Reuters) - After teaching for three years at an international school in Shanghai, Michael is preparing to break his contract and leave, worn down by stringent measures against the coronavirus. Following two years of nearly-shut borders, onerous health checks and quarantine norms, a decision at the beginning of April to lock down China’s commercial centre proved the last straw for the 35-year-old. ""It has reached a point where the economic benefits of working here don’t make up for the lack of freedom to come and go,"" the science teacher said, declining to give his full name for reasons of privacy. Michael is one of hundreds of international teachers heading for the exits as the COVID-19 pandemic and new rules on education reshape the working environment in China. The situation is prompting international schools that proliferated over the past two decades, as China opened up to foreign investment and talent, to sound warning bells. Some find their survival is now on the line, while the quality of education stands to suffer in the long run. About 40% of Michael's peers will leave mainland jobs this year, up from 30% last year and 15% before the pandemic, says a group of 66 schools in China that employs about 3,600 teachers. And hiring replacements for them is getting harder, said Tom Ulmet, executive director of the group, the Association of China and Mongolia International Schools (ACAMIS). ""People around the world have been reading about the lockdowns and just don't feel a need to subject themselves to that,"" he added. ENROLMENT FALL Apart from the departing teachers, international schools face a drop in foreign student enrolment as the COVID curbs led many foreign families to leave, while others stay away. This has changed the make-up of the student body in many schools, boosting the numbers of Chinese with at least one parent holding a foreign passport. While middle-class parents long saw international schools as a way to improve their children's chances of winning a place at top global universities, some have avoided emigrating in recent years as China was largely free of COVID. With fees that can exceed 300,000 yuan ($44,000) a year, the total annual value of tuition paid to international schools is estimated to be 55.4 billion yuan ($8.2 billion). And international schools nationwide numbered 821 by 2019, says education website Xinxueshuo. Some international schools for younger children have also had to grapple with changing regulations, as Beijing moves to limit foreign influence in the education system. That resulted in the recent removal of the name of Britain's Harrow School from an affiliated school in Beijing, while Westminster School dropped a plan for schools around China. Both Hong Kong-based Asia International School Limited, whose subsidiary operates Harrow-affiliated schools in China, and Westminster declined to comment. In a May flash poll of European businesses by the European Chamber of Commerce, all respondents from the education sector said increasingly tough COVID curbs had made China a less attractive destination for investment. QUALITY CONCERNS Parents with children at international schools told Reuters they were increasingly concerned about the quality on offer because of the strictures and the lockdowns caused by China's zero-tolerance policy on COVID-19. Melanie Ham's daughter missed International Baccalaureate (IB) exams in May, along with her entire cohort, after the Shanghai lockdown held up delivery of question papers arriving from overseas for the IB and Advanced Placement (AP) exams. Her daughter's school was trying its best, Ham said, but she was still worried about the future. ""I think they're just scraping by with whatever they can, as far as resources and planning and emotional energy (are concerned)."" Such woes meant the death knell for some schools in southern China, said Aleksa Moss, the head of early learning at an international school in the city of Guangzhou. ""A couple of the lower-tier international and bilingual schools closed down here,"" she said, adding, ""I'm sure it’s happening in Shanghai and Beijing."" The turmoil is fuelling demand for teachers who have opted to stay on, however. Jessica, a middle school teacher with almost 20 years of experience in China, said she was flooded with interview requests at a recent online jobs fair. ""I was offered so much money,"" she said, adding that one school in the capital, Beijing, dangled a base starting salary of more than 50,000 yuan ($7,361) a month.

5/20/2022,"STORY: As North Korea battles an explosive COVID-19 outbreak, leader Kim Jong Un has slammed his country's response to the crisis. Kim met government officials on Tuesday (May 17) and, according to state media, called their efforts 'immature' and inadequate. Since North Korea first acknowledged the outbreak last week, it has reported some 1.7 million people with fever symptoms and more than 60 deaths. The country has mobilized its armed forces to help fight the virus with state television on Tuesday showing large numbers of troops gathered in a square in the capital. Yet, North Korea has not stated mass vaccinations and has limited testing capabilities. Many experts are concerned it may be difficult to assess how widely and rapidly the disease is spreading. All this comes as Kim is said to be considering testing an intercontinental ballistic missile in the next few days. According to U.S. and South Korean officials, the test is expected to happen ahead of U.S. President Joe Biden's first official trip to South Korea on Friday. A weapons test could overshadow Biden's trip and complicate international efforts to offer Pyongyang aid in its battle against COVID. A UN spokesperson warned on Tuesday efforts by North Korea to curb the virus could have devastating consequences for human rights in the country.",Politics/Reuters Videos,N.Korean leader slams officials for COVID response,https://news.yahoo.com/n-korean-leader-slams-officials-090127116.html
5/20/2022,"President Vladimir Putin has long tried to project an image of abundant good health. Ukrainian officials claimed in May that he is hiding that he is ""very ill"" with cancer. Rumors of health problems and secret surgery have followed the Russian president for decades. Speculation about President Vladimir Putin's health reached fever pitch on Sunday after former MI6 Russia spy Christopher Steele indicated the Russian president could be seriously ill. Speaking to Sky News, Steele said Putin's health could be a factor in the unfolding invasion of Ukraine. Since invading Ukraine Putin has had shaky media appearances and has been described — with varying reliability — as suffering from everything from Parkinson's disease to dementia. Putin has for decades cultivated an image of virile masculinity at peak fitness — but an investigation by independent Russian media outlet Proekt alleged that this was only possible with significant deception. Most specifics about Putin's health are almost impossible to confirm. His top spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has repeatedly denied any issues. Medical professionals have refused to give weight to the rumors, as Deutsche Welle reported, arguing that accurate diagnoses can only be made by in-person examinations. Here is a timeline of moments when Putin's health has come into question. In fall 2012, Reuters cited three government sources saying Putin had back trouble and would need surgery soon. The Kremlin denied this, but after Russian newspaper Vedomosti said that Putin had hurt himself while hang-gliding, Peskov said the trouble was due to ""an ordinary sporting injury"" in which Putin had strained a muscle, as The Atlantic reported. By the end of December 2012, Proekt alleged that Putin was wearing a corset and significantly limiting — or even skipping — sit-down engagements due to likely back problems. The outlet cited unnamed Russian officials for the information. On November 4, Russia's National Unity Day, the Kremlin limited itself to still photos of Putin's appearance at a ceremony in Red Square, according to Proekt. However, footage posted by religious leaders in Moscow showed the president with a slight limp. By matching the check-in dates of medical specialists with Putin's travel schedule, Proekt found that Putin was regularly accompanied by at least five doctors in these years — a number that would later swell to 13. They included an ENT specialist, an infectious diseases specialist, a staff rescuscitologist, and a neurosurgeon, the outlet reported. Between November 25 and December 1, Putin appeared only in pre-recorded meetings, Proekt reported. Meanwhile, 12 specialists suddenly checked in at the Sochi hospital near his residence, including his personal doctors, neurosurgeons, and a rehabilitation specialist, according to Proekt. Putin, an avid ice hockey player, almost somersaulted when he crashed to the ground during a match in Sochi at the age of 64, CNN reported. According to Proekt, the player Pavel Bure had crashed into him. After this, an orthopedic traumatologist known to regularly treat the president checked in to a hospital just outside Putin's residence, Proekt reported. Between August 8 and 16 that year, the president disappeared from public view, with oncologist-surgeon Evgeny Selivanov, Proekt reported. The presence of an ENT doctor suggested a thyroid issue, the outlet said. Selivanov joined Putin's medical entourage, flying to his location 35 times in the space of four years, the outlet reported. Only ENT doctors have seen him more often, the outlet said. Putin disappeared from view from February 12 to 1 in 2018, just one month before polling day, Proekt reported. Acknowledging his canceled events, Peskov said Putin has a cold, per ABC News. A COVID-19 outbreak among presidential staff in September last year led Putin to self-isolate for two weeks. Ten days later, he denied any ill health after he was seen coughing during a televised meeting. Soon after, The New York Times reported that Putin was imposing increasingly stringent isolation procedures on anyone due to see him face-to-face — including isolation for two weeks prior and the requirement to pass through a disinfectant tunnel. This came weeks after Russia lifted most of its COVID-19 measures nationwide, the paper reported. By February 2022 — as world leaders implored him not to invade Ukraine — Putin was having his in-person meetings at an extraordinarily long table. Bizarre footage of Putin meeting with his defense minister on April 21 showed the president gripping the edge of the table, looking uncomfortable and fidgety, as Newsweek reported. Along with his bloated appearance, the video prompted a welter of tabloid speculation — none of which was confirmed — that he could be suffering from the effects of steroid treatment or Parkinson's disease. —max seddon (@maxseddon) April 21, 2022 Further unverified rumors were emanated from an anonymous Telegram account claiming to be a former Kremlin insider. In early May, New Lines Magazine obtained a recording of an unnamed Russian oligarch saying that Putin ""is very ill with blood cancer."" The oligarch, who did not know he was being recorded, went on to criticize Putin's invasion of Ukraine, saying that ""we all hope"" he dies, and that ""the problem is with his head."" Ukrainian intelligence chief Maj. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov told Sky News on May 14 that plans to overthrow Putin were in motion within Russia, and that the 69-year-old was in a ""very bad psychological and physical condition and he is very sick."" Putin is sick with cancer, Budanov said. He denied trying to propagate that idea or propaganda to advantage Ukraine.
