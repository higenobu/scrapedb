2/28/2022,"The New South Wales coroner is considering an inquest into the deaths of four food delivery riders killed in road accidents between October and November 2020. After last year’s government taskforce into the gig economy, the NSW coroner’s court confirmed it may launch an inquiry into the deaths of three Uber Eats delivery riders – Dede Fredy, Bijoy Paul and Ik Wong, as well as the death of Hungry Panda rider Xiaojun Chen. Fredy, a 36-year-old man from Indonesia, died on 27 September 2020 after he was hit by a car in Sydney while delivering food. Paul, a 27-year-old man from Bangladesh, was hit by a car in Rockdale in November 2020 while on a delivery for Uber Eats. Wong also died in November, while 43-year-old Chen died in hospital in October after his motorcycle collided with a bus in Zetland. Guardian Australia understands deputy coroner Derek Lee is currently collecting evidence and documents used as part of the government taskforce. The Transport Workers’ Union has urged the coroner to proceed with the inquest, and also include the death of Burak Doğan as part of any investigation. Doğan, a 30-year-old student from Turkey, was hit and killed on 2 April 2020 in Sydney. According to the ABC’s Background Briefing program, his death was not reported as a workplace fatality because his last trip was cancelled 25 minutes before he was killed. Doğan was still logged into the UberEats app when he was killed, the ABC reported. The NSW coroner had already decided against an inquest into his death. The TWU national secretary, Michael Kaine, said investigations were long overdue. “NSW coronial inquests would shine a spotlight on the deadly pressures on food delivery riders,” he said. “Industrial pressures remain to this day and any finding that these pressures contributed to the deaths of these riders should ring alarm bells in parliament and inform regulation to prevent worker deaths in the future. “The families of riders’ killed continue to grapple with the indescribable loss of their loved one and deserve answers. That’s why these inquests must proceed.” A spokesperson for Uber said safety was fundamental to the company’s platform. “Any fatality on our roads is one too many. The loss of Dede Fredy, Bijoy Paul and Ik Wong is devastating and our thoughts are with their family and friends,” the spokesperson said. “As part of our commitment to safety, last year we accelerated our product roadmap in support of safe delivery. This included the launch of a range of safety initiatives aimed at helping delivery people stay safe on our roads, such as the rollout of personal protective equipment, in-app tech features and education modules which have been built specifically for the Australian market.” The deaths of five riders in the state in the space of two months in late 2020 led to the NSW government establishing the taskforce to investigate the state of the food delivery industry. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning SafeWork NSW conducted observations of 214 riders and issued seven improvement notices to food delivery platforms, as well as 28 warnings to riders over lack of adequate PPE or safety concerns. The final action plan delivered in April last year was criticised by the Transport Workers’ Union and riders for only recommending minor changes to the industry, such as design changes to the app or “improved bag ergonomics”. The NSW government was due to finalise new laws to improve safety practices at the end of 2021, however the legislation has yet to be introduced into the NSW parliament. The state government in August was hailing safety improvements in the sector, stating there were only six reported rider injuries between April and June last year, down 70% on the previous year. Former Guardian Australia journalist Naaman Zhou’s reporting on the deaths of delivery riders and ongoing pay and safety issues in the industry in 2020 was awarded the public service journalism award at the Walkley Awards on Friday night.

2/28/2022,"The warning to rich Russians linked to Putin that the UK government “will come after you” and ensure oligarchs have “nowhere to hide” is likely to hit hard at the gated luxury housing estate in Surrey dubbed “Britain’s Beverly Hills”. Russians and those from former Soviet states own more than a quarter of the 430 luxurious homes in St George’s Hill, a heavily guarded 964-acre estate near Weybridge, Surrey, where mansions have changed hands for more than £20m each. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, said on Sunday that the government was drawing up a “hitlist” of oligarchs with links to Putin who will be added to the sanctions list in coming days and weeks. “We have to make it deeply painful for the oligarchs that support the Putin regime. There are over a hundred Russian billionaires,” she told the Sunday Times. “Nothing is off the table in terms of who or what we are targeting. We are very clear about that – we are very prepared to do what it takes.” Brad, one of six fluorescent jacket-wearing security guards who prevented the Guardian from entering St George’s Hill, said there were more Russians living on the estate now than at any time in his six years working at the gate. “I imagine they are getting a bit nervous now about what Boris [Johnson] might do now that Putin has invaded Ukraine,” he said. “But, there’s one thing I can tell you for sure, they won’t want to talk to you and we are calling the police unless you leave now.” Brad was right. None of the drivers of cars leaving the estate, including the chauffeur of a white Bentley, would speak about the potential sanctions threat. However, a few minutes’ walk away at a council estate that backs on the estate it was hard to stop Joy, a 75-year-old retired furniture saleswoman, from speaking her mind about “all those bloody dodgy Russians next door”. “I think they should all be turfed out of the country,” she said. “Why should they be allowed to live here when there is a war going on over there. The only way to stop Putin is to put pressure on Russians. “The rich Russians who live in the huge houses over there,” Joy said, pointing at the fence that separates the communal garden of her council estate from the St George’s Hill golf course in the estate, “the government should seize their houses.” Johnson has so far announced sanctions on more than 100 Russian companies and eight individuals in what he described as “the largest and most severe package of economic sanctions that Russia has ever seen”. “We will continue on a remorseless mission to squeeze Russia from the global economy piece by piece, day by day and week by week,” he added. St George’s Hill is home to a greater concentration of rich Russians than Belgravia’s Eaton Square – nicknamed Red Square by some locals – where Roman Abramovich and Oleg Deripaska have had homes, and Highgate in north London, where several huge mansions are owned by oligarchs including Witanhurst, the UK’s second largest house after Buckingham Palace. Built by developer Walter George Tarrant in the 1910s and 1920s, the St George’s Hill estate was originally popular with British business people and celebrities including John Lennon, Ringo Starr, Tom Jones, Kate Winslet, Elton John and Cliff Richard. An increasing number of Russians began to move in during the 2000s after the introduction of the so-called “golden visa” scheme allowed wealthy people to enter the UK if they invested at least £2m and Chelsea’s billionaire owner, Roman Abramovich, moved the club’s training ground to nearby Cobham. The government axed the visa scheme earlier this month amid concerns about applicants having acquired their wealth illegally. House prices on the estate rose by more than a fifth last year, according to luxury estate agent Savills, taking the total value of the homes on the estate to more than £3bn. There is no suggestion that people named on the sanction list live on the estate. A UK diplomatic source said the people to be subjected to forthcoming sanctions were “people who have international lifestyles”. “They come to Harrods to shop, they stay in our best hotels when they like, they send their children to our best public schools, and that is what’s being stopped,” the diplomat said. “So that these people are essentially persona non grata in every major western European capital in the world. That really bites.” Johnson has also ordered the creation of a new dedicated “Kleptocracy Cell” within the National Crime Agency to “target sanctions evasion and corrupt Russian assets hidden in the UK and that means oligarchs in London who have nowhere to hide”. Margaret Hodge, a Labour MP and chair of the all-party parliamentary group on anti-corruption, said the measures do not go far enough and meant people “who have stolen from the Russian people and support Putin would not be caught”. “Russians don’t come here for the weather, but instead for our lax regulation, pathetic law enforcement and a property market that is ripe for abuse,” she said. Hodge called on the government to target sanctions at the 35 “kleptocrats” that Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny claims support Putin’s regime. The Navalny list includes Abramovich and Alisher Usmanov, who previously owned a 15% stake in Arsenal FC. Only two people on the Navalny list: Gennady Timchenko, a Russian investor and Putin ally, and Denis Bortnikov, deputy president of the Russian state-owned VTB bank, were subjected to government sanctions last week. Over the weekend, Abramovich passed control of Chelsea FC, which he bought in 2003, to the club’s charitable foundation after a call in parliament for him to be sanctioned after the invasion of Ukraine. Labour MP Chris Bryant said the Home Office had identified Abramovich as having links to the Russian state as well as to “corrupt activity and practices” and suggested the UK should seize his assets. Transparency International estimated that Russians accused of corruption or with links to the Kremlin have bought about £1.5bn of UK property since 2016. Security at St George’s Hill, which includes automatic number plate recognition technology, was heavily tightened after a Russian millionaire resident was found dead on a street near his home in November 2012. Alexander Perepilichnyy, a whistleblower who helped expose a multimillion-pound fraud in Russia, was found by a coroner to have died of natural causes – sudden arrhythmic death syndrome – while jogging. The coroner said he could not “completely eliminate all possibility” that Perepilichnyy was the victim of foul play but “there is no direct evidence that he was killed or any compelling circumstantial evidence either”.",News/World news,Tensions rise at the £3bn Surrey estate Russian oligarchs call home,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/tensions-rise-at-the-3bn-surrey-estate-russian-oligarchs-call-home
2/28/2022,"I have power of attorney over my 86-year-old mum’s finances due to her failing health. I received a letter regarding her Lloyds Bank home insurance policy which was up for renewal. The price was £606, a crazy figure given that she lives alone in a modest terrace house. I got replacement cover with another insurer for £127, and cancelled the Lloyds policy which auto-renewed each year. She had been with Lloyds since 2009. The backlog of excessive charges for her home insurance must be astronomical. Have I any recourse to claim any of this back on her behalf? DF, by email On 1 January the Financial Conduct Authority introduced rules that require insurers to offer the same price to existing policyholders as they do to new customers. The move was, in part, to stop people like your mother from paying so much more than those who shop around. My initial thought was that the rules hadn’t worked. But it emerged that the policy had been auto-renewed in August. In theory, she should have received a lower quote had she renewed this year. Despite that, I can see why you feel so aggrieved, given that it looks as though your mother has been considerably overpaying for many years. It is not the first time that Lloyds has been called out for this behaviour. The bank defended its position on the basis it had written to her before each renewal asking if it “could offer something better dependent on the level of cover required”. It said that the £606 had been “calculated correctly”. “We’ve taken into consideration the information provided to us by her son who highlighted her vulnerability later in life. “In recognition of her specific circumstances, we are offering a payment of £588,” it tells me. Is this enough? I suspect that if you went to court for the remainder of the £2,000 or so that she may well have overpaid, Lloyds would likely settle – but only after a lengthy and time-consuming battle on your part. The Financial Ombudsman Service would probably side with Lloyds. In your shoes I would take the offer and move on. In the meantime, this letter should serve as a reminder to others with elderly parents to make sure they are paying a fair price for their policies. I fear insurers will find ways around the new FCA rules by claiming that existing policies differ from those offered to new customers, meaning you may still want to shop around at renewal time.

2/28/2022,"Q I have been good with my personal financial planning and have been saving to buy a house with my partner. We each have about £25,000 in our individual lifetime Isas (Lisas) so have over £50,000 in total saved. We are in no rush to buy and were waiting for the market to calm a little bit post-Covid. Neither of us has ever bought or owned property. Unfortunately my mother has been diagnosed with a rapidly spreading terminal cancer and she is likely to pass away in the next 18 months. At that point my sibling and I will jointly inherit her house. I have no intention of living in her property as I have established my life and career several hundred miles away. Either my sibling and I will sell the house, or they will buy me out of my half (most likely the former). How will inheriting this house affect my ability to use my lifetime Isas to buy a property? Will I still be considered a first-time buyer? Will this have an impact on my partner’s ability to apply for a joint mortgage with me using their own Lisa money and getting the government assistance? CC A If you buy a property after inheriting half of your mother’s home, you will still be able to use your savings in your lifetime Isa to put towards the purchase but only after paying a 25% withdrawal charge (which claws back the government bonus). That’s because already owning property – even if you’re not going to live in it – stops you being classed as a first-time buyer. On the plus side, your partner’s ability to use lifetime Isa savings – including the 25% government bonus – to put towards your joint purchase is unaffected by your inheritance. If you want your Isa savings and bonus the be unaffected, the answer is to buy a property before you inherit your share of your mother’s home and while you are still considered a first-time buyer. Buying before inheriting also means that you and your partner can benefit from relief from stamp duty land tax if you are buying in England or Northern Ireland, or relief from Land and Buildings Transaction Tax in Scotland. In England and Northern Ireland the relief is available on properties costing less than £500,000. The first £300,000 is charged at 0% while the remaining £200,000 is charged at 5%. In Scotland, first-time buyers do not pay tax on the first £175,000 of the purchase price. This relief is available for joint purchasers only if they are both (or all) first-time buyers so you would miss out if you waited to buy until after you inherited.",Lifestyle/Money,Will inheriting a house affect my status as a first-time buyer?,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/28/will-inheriting-a-house-affect-my-status-as-a-first-time-buyer
2/28/2022,"A will names your beneficiaries – the people you want to inherit your assets when you die, and appoints executors – the people who will manage the financial process. However, more than half of UK adults don’t have one. One of the main reasons is that they believe everything will automatically pass to their spouse or civil partner. But this is not necessarily true because your estate is shared out in a standard way defined by the law of intestacy. This decides who gets what and how much, as well as the order of priority starting with immediate family members, and then moving further down the line. Unfortunately, if you are not married or in a civil partnership your partner is not treated as a family member, so will not inherit anything through the intestacy rules, no matter how long you have been together. If you own your home jointly, they will, however, inherit that unless a will says otherwise. If your situation is at all complicated it is wise to hire an expert rather than attempting to set things out on your own. But be warned: will writing is an unregulated market. Ben Mason, chief executive of the estate planning law firm Kinherit, advises you check for a qualification from the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners when searching for professionals. This is not legally binding but it can help provide important, more personal, guidance to friends, family and a partner on what to do when you die. It can contain views, opinions and details that complement the will. You can, for example, give details about the distribution of your personal possessions, give instructions for how you think capital should be managed, or explain the background to any inheritance. You can even make “requests”, such as encouraging beneficiaries to make use of some of their inheritance in a certain way. “This is your chance to dispel any potential misunderstandings or wrong assumptions that may occur after your death,” says Andy Baker, partner and chartered financial planner at Equilibrium Financial Planning. “Think of the crushing disappointment someone may feel if they have been excluded from a will with no explanation.” Trusts are not only for the wealthy – they can also be useful if you have young children or a complicated family setup. For example, if you are worried a beneficiary might spend their inheritance all at once, a discretionary trust can be set up so they get smaller sums over a period. A trustee needs to be appointed to manage it on behalf of the beneficiaries in the will. When it comes to property, often the largest asset people include in a will, a life interest trust can help to safeguard the family home from the full impact of care home fees for the surviving spouse. This is useful if you have children from a previous relationship – your current partner or spouse can live in the property until they die, then the it is left to your children. According to MoneyHelper, a free advice service provided by the Money & Pensions Service, it costs £1,000 or more to set up a trust using a solicitor. It should be paid for and put in place along with your will before you die. Anything over the £325,000 limit can incur inheritance tax (IHT), which is 40%. But you can save by leaving everything over this limit to your spouse or civil partner. And anything you don’t use of your limit can be used by a surviving partner when they die. Your home can be left to your spouse or partner tax-free, and the IHT limit rises to £500,000 if you leave it to your children. Early planning can reduce the IHT bill. For example, you could transfer money to beneficiaries as gifts during your lifetime. You can give away up to £3,000-worth of gifts a year, and there are separate rules that allow large sums to be given when people get married. If you die within seven years of making other financial gifts, your estate or the recipient of the money may be liable to pay IHT. However, if they are from your regular income, form a part of your “normal expenditure”, are paid out on a regular basis, and do not have any impact on your own standard of living, they will be exempt. A life insurance policy will provide some financial protection to dependents and loved ones who receive a lump sum or regular payments upon your death. How much they get depends on the level of cover you buy. The greater the cover, of course, the more expensive the policy. The cost – typically paid on a monthly basis – is also determined by factors such as your age, lifestyle and family medical history. Life insurance can be bought through your bank, an insurer, a specialist broker or even from big supermarkets. Before you buy, however, check whether you are already covered through work. Many employers include death-in-service insurance as part of their benefits package, paying out a tax-free lump sum if you are on the payroll when you die. The advantage of this type of cover is that there’s no annual or monthly premium and the payout is linked to your salary. You may find it’s enough and you don’t need a life insurance policy as well. But unlike life insurance, death in service cover ends if you leave the company. Whatever type of insurance you opt for, however, it is vital you continually review the policy to ensure it still offers the right cover for your current circumstances and, importantly, the people named as beneficiaries are also up to date. The cost of a typical funeral is now about £4,100. The cheapest is cremation. For example, prices for a direct cremation start from £999, according to Sally Howarth, the founder of the price-comparison website Funeral Plan Market. This service – made famous by David Bowie – is unattended, with the remains of the deceased returned to the family who can celebrate a loved one’s life in their own way. Burials can cost £5,033 on average – in addition to purchasing the plot, there are interment fees to think about. Where you live also makes a difference, with London still the most expensive place to die with funerals costing £5,235 on average. Northern Ireland is the cheapest place, with average costs 23% below the national average. To help, you could invest in a prepaid funeral plan. Not only does it enable you to decide on arrangements in advance, your money is safeguarded and payments are held in a trust or whole of life policy. And with the cost of a funeral doubling in the past 12 years, says Howarth, a prepaid plan fixes the cost at today’s prices.",Lifestyle/Money,Wills and trusts: how to plan your finances for when you’re gone,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/28/wills-trusts-plan-your-finances-inheritance-tax-insurance
2/28/2022,"“We didn’t intend to be farmers,” Bob Paton says. In their 50s, he and his wife, Ann, envisaged “one more move”. They lived in Newcastle upon Tyne and had a checklist for their dream house: “Northumberland, stone-built, a bit of character and a reasonable garden,” Bob says. The place they found ticked every box but one. Instead of a reasonable garden, it had six acres. As they walked the grounds, Bob turned to Ann and said: “We could turn this into a small farm.” Eleven days before his 60th birthday, he retired as a managing director with the IT company Accenture. Ann, 63, had already sold her deli. Together they began to farm. The next two years were a struggle. The four fields were badly fenced and waterlogged. The soil was poor. Growing vegetables was “not a common thing to do in this cold, wet and windy area of Northumberland”, says Bob, 65. They dug up thousands of stones. “It was backbreaking. We would say: ‘What on earth are we doing?’” Ann says. She nudges Bob. “Del Boy here always said: ‘This time next year, if we’re not making money, we will give up.’” “We were never going to give up,” Bob interjects. “We’re not that type of people.” The son of a coal miner, Bob grew up in Ashington, 15 miles north of Newcastle. He helped his father on his allotment. “Sunday lunches in mining communities were big things. My dad used to dig up potatoes. They melted in your mouth – the freshness! The memory stayed with me. But I think it was the sense of trying to achieve something. Throughout my life I’ve been driven by trying to achieve things.” Ann’s father worked for ICI, the chemical company, and took “two or three jobs just to keep us all going”. Her mother was a seamstress and keen gardener. “We both come from very hard-working socialist families,” she says. They met in the 90s in Ann’s deli, Country Whey. Bob’s first words to her were: “Can I have a peanut butter and banana sandwich with red onions, tomato, in a white butty, cut in half? Please.” They became friends as their marriages were ending. One day, they were walking on Gateshead Millennium Bridge and Ann realised: “Bloody hell, I love him. One minute I didn’t and the next minute I did.” “We had the same beliefs. We both like gardening,” Bob says. “It wasn’t just the gardening – it was life in general,” Ann says. “You couldn’t do this sort of thing if you didn’t get on well.” They married in 2012. “Dream team,” Ann says. The turning point on the farm came in summer 2018, when an adviser from the Soil Association told the couple: “You’re making fantastic progress.” It was “a fillip we needed,” Bob says. They were advised to stop digging, to preserve the soil structure. “Overnight, our produce became amazing,” Bob says. “It was transformational.” In the months that followed, the Patons could say with confidence: “We’re farmers.” Now one field is home to a two-acre orchard. Two others house polytunnels, herbs and 50 varieties of vegetable. The fourth belongs to their Tamworth pigs. As Hexhamshire Organics, they sell 100 organic vegetable boxes a week, and supply Northumberland’s only Michelin-starred restaurant. “I used to say I retired, but now I say I had a career change,” Bob says. They have never worked so hard. “It’s usually the light that stops us,” Ann says. She brings a career in catering and retail to bear on the business, while Bob is the planner. “Plan tomorrow today. Plan next week this week. Plan next month this month,” he says. His spreadsheet logs “every single vegetable”, from sowing to harvest, and calculates output to the square foot. Ann puts it more simply. “We are an elderly couple growing vegetables in Northumberland. It happens to be organic. And it happens to be – although we say so ourselves – not bad produce.” Still, it is very labour-intensive, and I wonder how much longer they want to keep doing this. “I don’t want to stop, ever,” Bob says. He looks at Ann. “While we can,” she says, “we will.” Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?",Lifestyle/Life and style,A new start after 60: ‘We both like gardening – so we became farmers’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/28/a-new-start-after-60-we-both-like-gardening-so-we-became-farmers
2/28/2022,"It is difficult to forget the images of people desperately clinging on to the wings of military aircraft as they set off from the besieged Kabul airport last August. The UK government quickly responded with “operation warm welcome”, in which 15,000 people were flown to the UK with the commitment that 20,000 more would be given sanctuary in the coming years. Now, much closer to home, around 1,500 miles away in Ukraine, another human tragedy is unfolding. This time there aren’t any planes that can evacuate desperate men, women and children because Russian military aircraft control the skies. Instead, the images we see are of trains crammed full of scared, anxious and bewildered families trying to get to safety with the Ukrainian army forced to fire into the air above the heads of its own people to try to create some kind of order. The UN says that up to four million people could flee their country. It would be the largest refugee crisis Europe has witnessed for decades. When the Labour MP Nadia Whittome asked the prime minister last week if his government would commit to accepting all Ukrainian refugees who wished to come to the UK, Boris Johnson didn’t duck the question. He told the Commons, “This country will continue to do what it has always done and receive those who are fleeing in fear of persecution. That is what we will do.” But his words appear to ring hollow: there has yet to be any announcement of an equivalent “operation warm welcome” for Ukrainians. All the government has done so far is allow Ukrainians in the UK to bring over extended family members. And this doesn’t even allow for extended family members to be reunited. In comparison to the EU’s decision announced on Sunday evening to take in refugees for up to 3 years without having to apply for asylum, it is mean spirited and sends a message to desperate Ukrainians that unless they have an immediate family member in the UK they are not welcome. And worse still, consider the Home Office minister Kevin Foster, having to delete a tweet saying that Ukrainians seeking to flee the ongoing conflict should apply for the seasonal worker visa. The situation facing innocent Ukrainians uprooted from their homes requires a far more urgent and compassionate response from the prime minister. We should be playing a leading role by strengthening safe routes, to help those escaping the bloodshed who want to come to the UK to do so. There are already hundreds of thousands heading across Ukraine’s borders with Hungary, Poland and Romania. Reception centres are being set up in collaboration with the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) for the mainly women and children who have fled, having left boyfriends, husbands and fathers to take up arms to defend themselves. Most will want to stay in the hope of returning to their homes and communities as soon as possible. It’s important to remember that the reality for refugees is that around eight out of 10 remain in neighbouring countries. For example, around 1.5 million who have fled the brutal war in Syria remain in Lebanon, hoping to return to their homeland one day. There will, however, be some that do want to get to safety elsewhere in Europe. The government must establish a safe route to ensure people fleeing the bloodshed and atrocities can apply for a visa on humanitarian grounds to enable them to travel to the UK safely to able to be granted permission to stay in our country. The government must also work with the UNHCR to ensure a longer term resettlement scheme is in place. The UK Resettlement Scheme (UKRS), which is separate to the Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme (ACRS), is already operational, currently receiving refugees from the Middle East, mainly displaced by the Syrian conflict. This could be expanded so that Ukrainians have a longer term resettlement scheme they can access. A long-term safe route will be critical in the months and years ahead if this becomes a drawn-out conflict. And there is strong public backing – more than six out of 10, according to the latest YouGov poll, would support safe routes to resettle Ukrainians, including a majority of both Conservative and Labour voters. It’s critical that cross-government planning and strong collaboration with councils and public health services gets under way immediately, so they are adequately resourced to meet the need. Partnership working with local authorities, together with sufficient additional funding, are the key elements that the government has struggled to get right for the Afghan programme. The tragedy in Ukraine also highlights the crucial flaw with the nationality and borders bill going through parliament this week. The bill destroys the longstanding principle that all who seek asylum get a fair hearing – and instead proposes treating those who have to take dangerous journeys overland as criminals. These controversial proposals have been condemned by the former prime minister John Major. The bill is cruel and discriminatory. We should be proudly demonstrating that refugee protection is a great British value, rather than creating a two-tier system whereby some refugees are unfairly punished for the way they get to the UK. From the horrors of the second world war to the atrocities in the Balkans, and more recently the innocent families forced out of Syria and those fleeing the persecution of the Taliban, we have welcomed our fellow humans in need of protection. We must do the same for Ukrainians today. What we certainly must not do is introduce laws that seek to repel and punish people who, through no fault of their own, have lost everything.

I like big songs that feel quite upbeat, the songs that people love – me singing them, less so. The song I inexplicably know every lyric toJustified & Ancient by the KLF. We sang it when I was in a band 10 years ago. We were called Geoff Leopard and we were really bad. My friend Justine was in it and knows the middle rap really well. She was at some awards do and thought everyone would be really impressed if she launched into the rap. They let her finish and said: please never do that again. The best song to have sex toWhen I first got with my boyfriend, the first or second time we were going back to smooch, as a joke I said: “Alexa, play Barry White.” It was the only sexy music I could think of. The best song to play at a partyThe Spree Wilson cover of Champagne Supernova. Everyone knows Champagne Supernova – it’s just an even more fun version. The song I want played at my funeralI don’t think I’d care cos I’ll be somewhere else, having a wonderful time. It’d be good to play something to get a laugh, to cheer everyone up. Maybe like Justin Timberlake’s SexyBack, or It’s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas, just to mix it up. The song I can’t help singingI Try by Macy Gray. It’s so good, isn’t it? I was a teenager at the time it came out, getting off with way older men. You look back, like: “Crikey, I don’t know how good some of that was … ” But belting this out in a car, feeling very grownup – that was great. The song I have to get up to turn offAnything by R Kelly. It’s a shame, he did do some catchy songs, before he was proven to be a massive, horrible nonce. The song I tell people is my favouriteI don’t think you can have a “favourite song” and it winds me up when people ask. You can’t have one! Time is evolving, and we are, constantly. My favourite song today is Loving Is Easy by Rex Orange County (feat Benny Sings). It’s so beautiful and mellow, the lyrics are sort of sad but also quite happy. The message is: loving is easy! If Twitter – and the world – could take that message on board, wouldn’t it be a nicer life?!

2/28/2022,"Afew years ago, I sat through an enjoyable lecture by the artist Grayson Perry about the familiar evils of rigid ideas of masculinity: war, imperialism, misogyny, alienation. The lecture was part of a festival called Being a Man (or BAM! for less evolved members of the tribe). Perry ended his comments with a scribbled series of demands on a whiteboard for a new bill of men’s rights, with which it was hard to argue. “We men ask ourselves and each other for the following: the right to be vulnerable, to be uncertain, to be wrong, to be intuitive, the right not to know, to be flexible and not to be ashamed.” He insisted that men sit down and mostly talk quietly to achieve these aims and was given a rousing standing ovation. The need for men to be vulnerable, to open up about their insecurities – to become, in cliched terms, more like women – is certainly one antidote to what has become widely understood as the current crisis in masculinity. Thinking about that lecture afterwards, though, it felt a bit limited as a solution. There is no question that mansplainers and manspreaders could do with a fatal dose of humility and doubt. But what about that generation of young men who already feel marginalised from a consumer society, who have been denied most of the markers that traditionally help boys become men: decent jobs, responsible dads, stable homes of their own and, often in consequence, meaningful adult relationships. Would opening up about doubt and vulnerability in itself allow them to achieve self-worth and purpose? Nina Power’s provocative and rigorous book addresses some of those questions from a traditional feminist perspective. When she asked her male friends the question in her book’s title, “What do men want?”, most of them played up to stereotypes: “to be left alone”, “pussy”, “a shed”, “Nigella Lawson”. While she analyses the predictable adolescence of such responses and what might lie behind them, she is more interested in the aspiration of a single one of her mates: “to be a good man”. What, today, might that look like? Power, an academic philosopher whose previous book, One Dimensional Woman, was a critique of the limits to choice for women in a capitalist world, begins with a few truisms that our political times have made controversial. “Certain things should be clear from the outset,” she writes, “to be a man is not in itself a bad thing.” And then, in a statement of considerable bravery, at least in certain social media circles: “I believe that the difference between the sexes is real and important on every level of our collective being… sex has a historical as well as a biological reality. It is destructive to everyone to pretend that is not true.” The history, she insists, is as important as the biology. While it is at best naive to imagine that any society can, overnight, usefully be reconstructed on gender-neutral grounds (however desirable that outcome), it would truly be absurd to imagine that “everything that our ancestors understood [about men and women] is irrelevant”. Rather, she insists, “we would do well to revisit old values and virtues” in order to “live together better”. In this context Power examines some of the extreme manifestations of the broken relationship between the sexes. She looks at the economic and cultural circumstances as well as the disturbingly warped psychology that produce “incel” (involuntary celibate) groups, or the MGTOW (Men Going Their Own Way) movement. In addressing this damaged thinking she refuses easy essentialist answers about toxic masculinity or any simplistic notions of patriarchy. She will not, for example, wholly dismiss the appeal of a figure such as Jordan Peterson, who offers the promise of basic structure and meaning in profoundly unstructured and meaningless male lives. If men are to reclaim an idea of “virility” – in its original Greek sense of acting with virtue, of living with grace and due responsibility – it will, she argues, not be done by hashtags alone. “Our age often promotes, inculcates and celebrates infantilism and complaint,” she writes; #KillAllMen will get women – and men – nowhere. Another book, on a similar subject, from the same publisher, is not quite so convinced. Ivan Jablonka’s history of masculinity became something of a surprise bestseller in France. Jablonka adopts a much wider lens in analysing the problem with men, one that begins in the division of labour in paleolithic societies and runs through the ultimate mansplaining prophets of the Abrahamic religions to take in pop music lyrics and English boarding schools. “Once the end of men has been diagnosed,” Jablonka writes, in spirited translation, “men can be reinvented as fair and just.” In contrast to his long prehistory, men, he believes, are suddenly “capable of renouncing the brawny male, the brute, the swine in us. And when we have made cracks in the masculinities of domination, out of them will come human beings rid of their little game of virility.” Jablonka presents himself as a humble conduit for that revolution. “What am I doing here, amid the feminist struggle?” he wonders, “is it possible to fight the patriarchy as a man?” His 354 pages make the profoundly confident Gallic case for that new humility – but Nina Power’s slimmer volume makes a much more urgent claim to any spare man hours.

2/28/2022,"As “winterkeeper” at Yellowstone national park, Steven Fuller lives in a rustic cedar-shingled cottage, built in 1910, set on a hill a short walk from the majestic Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. On balmier days, with the windows open, he can hear the roar of the 308ft Lower Falls tumbling into the chasm. In autumn, he is treated to the sound of bugling bull elk in rut or, in the middle of night, the howls of wolves. A key part of Fuller’s professional responsibility in winter, when deep snow and bone-chilling cold shuts down tourist operations for five months in the centre of Yellowstone, is removing snow from building rooftops to prevent them from collapsing under the weight of the load. His solitary existence might seem idyllic, but when Fuller and his English wife, Angela, landed the winterkeeping assignment in 1973, there wasn’t a long line of competitors. He was the only applicant. “Back then, being a winterkeeper at Canyon was considered a hardship post where the isolation was reputed to drive people crazy,” Fuller remembers, noting they had no phone or TV and the internet was decades away. In the evenings, they listened to BBC news broadcasts via shortwave radio. “Then again, in those days, the world seemed a much bigger place, with fewer of us on the planet and such a thing as solitude wasn’t in short supply,” he adds. Today, the proliferation of digital technology, which enables faster-paced park visitors to share a selfie on social media from the remotest mountain peaks, has made Yellowstone’s vastness feel smaller, he says. The bittersweet lament comes as Yellowstone marks its 150th anniversary on 1 March as America’s first national park and one of the first in the world. For Fuller it coincides with his 49th year as Yellowstone winterkeeper, the longest anyone has held the post in the park’s history. “Going back to the 19th century, winterkeepers tended to be basically backwoods good ol’ boys, and not necessarily with a high level of education,” retired Yellowstone park historian Lee Whittlesey says. “They were looked upon as refugees from civilisation, trying to get away by hiding out as hermits. Steve Fuller has done a lot to change that prosaic image, but he has his own Thoreauvian place as an anomaly in the 21st century.” Fuller says the changes he has observed in Yellowstone have been profound. “It’s difficult sometimes to sort out the paradoxes,” he says. Yellowstone is coping with record numbers of visitors and yet, Fuller notes, the park is in some ways wilder than when he arrived. Grizzly bears, whose numbers in the park dipped to just 136 in the 1970s, have been rescued from a population freefall. Wolves, deliberately exterminated by park rangers in the 1920s, were brought back in the mid-1990s. And bison population, which numbered just 23 at one point in the late 19th century, is today at 5,000. In 1973, the year Fuller arrived, there were slightly more than 2 million visits recorded in Yellowstone. Last year, Covid-19 set off a rush of people to the park and there were nearly 4.9 million – 800,000 more than in 2019, the year before the pandemic struck. This year, given the publicity for the park’s 150th anniversary, Yellowstone may surpass 5 million visitors. Tourism brings millions of dollars in revenue to neighbouring communities and creates thousands of jobs but the growing numbers have come at a cost, says Fuller. “Traffic congestion in summer is a lot worse – a lot. I experience it first-hand,” Fuller says. “I’m reluctant to go anywhere in the park during the day when I have free time. You might set out on a drive that would ordinarily take you 30 minutes, but the chances of getting stuck in traffic and taking three times as long are good.” Most tourists stick to the roads and short trails, directly affecting only about 2% of the park’s 8,900 sq km (2.2m acres), notes Yellowstone superintendent Cam Sholly. Scenes of traffic gridlock and full carparks are real, but they create an inaccurate perception, Sholly says. Most of Yellowstone is sparse of people and the farther one wanders away from the asphalt, the more likely it is that wildlife outnumbers those on two legs. The crowdless backcountry serves as an important refuge for wildlife, but this space is shrinking amid a development boom in the Rocky Mountain west. Sholly is also concerned about the climate crisis dramatically altering habitats for wildlife, and the growing threat of exotic plants overtaking native species that support the health of animals such as elk, deer, pronghorn and bison. Fuller echoes Sholly’s worries. “We’ve had 20 below [fahrenheit] with more frequency, but not the deep cold stretches of minus 30, minus 40, sometimes 50 below that were a defining aspect of winter here,” Fuller says. “While weather swings are normal, the trend, overall, is in the direction of earlier spring meltoff.” His perception is corroborated by scientific evidence. Over the last half century, the growing season (the time between the last freeze of spring and the first freeze of autumn) has increased by 30 days in the park’s valleys. Meanwhile, near Yellowstone’s north-east entrance, which has typically been colder than other parts of the park, scientists say there are 80 more days a year above freezing than in the 1960s. Such conditions mean the snowpack is melting during winter and leaving the mountains earlier in spring, which causes some rivers to run lower in late summer and drier forests, which are more susceptible to wildfire. Despite the challenges, Fuller could not imagine living anywhere else. Fuller says the park still offers important lessons to other parts of the world, including the UK. Fuller considers himself a proud anglophile. He spent one of his college years at Leeds University. A few years later, he fell in love with Angela and married her. They spent time in Uganda and raised two daughters in Yellowstone, home schooling them into their teens. With the Yellowstone ecosystem holding the distinction of having the largest concentration of mammals in the lower 48 states, lessons in how humans and wildlife can better coexist abound. Fuller shares stories of the bison that recently trudged past his window and rested in the snow near a walkway leading to his front door, and of grizzlies, including mother bears with cubs, ambling around his “wild neighbourhood”, or seeing the aftermath of a successful wolf predation on an elk, and foxes and coyotes routinely mousing in the meadows. Fuller knows that many animals in Yellowstone can be dangerous, and he is under no false illusion about them seeking close human companionship, as one might see portrayed by Hollywood. He has never been injured, but he often gives wildlife a wide berth out of respect for their space. “The older I’ve become, the more I’ve begun to appreciate the sentient connections between living things here and the places they inhabit,” he says. “In 1872, when Yellowstone was created, I don’t think the US Congress could have possibly imagined how vital, as a symbol, this place would be in our time. Protecting nature for its own sake was a remarkable expression of foresight that we are only now beginning to fully understand.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment,"Yellowstone at 150: busier yet wilder than ever, says park’s ‘winterkeeper’",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/28/yellowstones-winterkeeper-50-years-watching-over-national-park-aoe
2/28/2022,"The past two years have been rough at times for those who enjoy outdoor sports. Climbers without crags on their doorstep have ruined their elbows hanging from door frames. Cyclists have invested in indoor training machines. For many, getting outside has meant running in nearby parks and dashing to hills and lakes whenever the opportunity has arisen. While outdoor adventure documentaries have long been a staple of this community, they took on a new meaning during the pandemic as a reminder of a world beyond working from home and trying to stay fit. The Banff Mountain Film festival has long showcased the best of this genre, and in more recent years has also taken it on tour: over the rest of this year it is showing at 50 venues across the UK and Ireland. Some of the films will be familiar to many, but are worth catching on a big screen. In this category is The Slabs, featuring Scottish mountain biker Danny MacAskill’s terrifying descent of the 500-metre Dubh Slabs on the Isle of Skye. Filmed during lockdown in 2020, the film garnered millions of views when it was first released online last year. I have watched it several times, and MacAskill’s descent of the steepest section, a rounded ridge of bald granite still has my heart in my mouth. “Like all of us, 2020 threw a few curveballs in terms of travel and plans for the year,” said MacAskill. “I spent the first few months of lockdown riding for myself. When the lockdown eased a bit, we decided to go out and try to make a few films. I thought I’d start by looking close to home. “The Dubh Slabs are a well-known scrambling route that climbers and mountaineers use to access the Cuillin ridge. It’s this long, sustained bare piece of slab rock that rises from Loch Coruisk. “We ended up filming the slabs over two days rather than one. We managed to get a lot of the lines that I’d dreamed of doing on the first day, but the cloud came in towards the end and the last slab became off limits because it started raining. I did try to ride the very bottom of it, much to my friends’ horror. “The bike started getting a little bit out of control when I was about 50 metres from the bottom. Luckily I got it back. I don’t think it was very nice for my friends watching. I was on the limit of control. The tyres were at 99% of their grip limit and the brakes were also right at their very limit.” Also on a mountain biking theme is Follow the Light, in which professional cyclist Kilian Bron heads to Cappadocia, Turkey to ride among its photogenic “fairy chimneys” – the singular towers clustered on the high plateaux of central Anatolia. He is often seen riding beneath a cloud of hot air balloons, but the most spectacular scene has Bron following a flare mounted on a drone through a narrow canyon at night. The film’s French director, Pierre Henni, says: “[That shot] took us three evenings and we had to experiment a lot. “It was almost pitch black, so the only source of light for the drone pilot and the rider (as well as the filmer and photographer) was that flare on the drone, so it had to stay close to Kilian. As soon as the flare was ending. we needed to jump on our headlamps so the drone operator could see the landing zone.” Filmed in Germany’s Frankenjura region, Action Directe offers a different kind of sweaty-palm experience. It follows the protracted efforts of top French climber Melissa Le Nevé to be the first woman to climb the large limestone prow from which the film takes its title – almost 30 years after the late Wolfgang Güllich made the original ascent Climbing the short but fiercely overhanging wall in forest near Bayreuth requires a sequence of moves on single finger pockets in the rock, all shown clearly in the film, along with a dramatic leap for a hold. Yet all of these seem manicured alongside Exit the North Pole, which follows the attempt of famed polar traveller Børge Ousland and colleague Mike Horn to make a minimalist 1,300km traverse of the thinning ice of the Arctic Ocean. The pair used pack rafts and ski poles to move on the thinnest ice when they could not ski, and the resulting film depicts an exercise in elemental suffering in a place few of us will ever visit. “When it’s dark 24 hours a day, everything becomes much more difficult,” said Ousland. “You only see the small beam from your head torch – that’s your world. You have no idea what’s behind you. A polar bear can sneak up without you even noticing.” If that sounds like tough fare, there are several more playful films on the programme, prominent among them A Dog’s Tale. Anyone who has gone trail running or mountain biking with their dog will feel an immediate affinity, with this is the story about Raven, a 13-year-old retired trail dog who lives in Squamish, British Columbia. While it’s a twist on a familiar format – mountain bikers jumping berms in slow motion – its real charm is the dogs tearing down the descents with their owners. Entirely different again is the award-winning Dream Mountain, following Nepali climber Pasang Lhamu Sherpa Akita as climbed 6,440-metre Cholatse in the Everest region with her husband and two-year-old son in November 2019. Nepal’s first female mountaineering instructor, and the first Nepali woman to summit K2 – the world’s second-highest mountain – Pasang finds the Cholatse expedition different with her son in tow. Now she has to consider the conflicts between her dreams of climbing and her sense of responsibility. “One morning, I was interviewing Pasang on a ridge overlooking Mount Everest and Khumjung village, where she was born,” says film-maker Cira Crowell. “She was struggling for ways to express the challenges she experienced growing up – being told that climbing and mountains were inappropriate for girls. “A bell rang in the cold air and the students of Sir Edmund Hillary School poured out of the stacked-stone buildings to line up in neat rows for morning assembly. It triggered a memory in Pasang, who said: ‘You know, all those boys down there are free to do whatever they want to do in life. The girls cannot. All the girls should be able to follow their dreams too.’ “It was a mic-drop moment as we considered the fates of the girls below, and how limited their options still are. This moment epitomised the central theme of Dream Mountain.”",Lifestyle/Travel,"Epic cycling, tough climbs and elemental suffering: the Banff Mountain Film festival",https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/feb/28/epic-cycling-tough-climbs-and-elemental-suffering-the-banff-mountain-film-festival
