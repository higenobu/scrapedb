2/20/2022,"Sergei the meerkat and his rival Gio Compario have put comparison websites at the heart of many people’s buying decisions, but soaring energy price rises and new rules on insurance sales mean challenging times for the businesses they advertise. At a time when consumers are keener than ever to cut bills, the websites have found themselves without any deals to offer on energy because sky-high wholesale prices mean that suppliers are not offering cheap tariffs.  The sites earn commission from companies when customers switch to them, thought to be about £30 for some energy contracts and £40-50 for insurance policies. On Thursday, one of the biggest, MoneySupermarket, reported a 25% fall in profits last year, and said that revenues from home services, which include energy switching, were down 34%. The company said it was expecting zero revenue from its energy business in 2022. GoCompare, one of its rivals, said 2021 was a “year like no other” in the energy market. It paused that strand of its comparison service completely in September. “At the moment, there aren’t any competitive deals available for people to compare but we are hopeful that we can offer this service again in the near future and get back to helping our customers save money on their energy bills,” a spokesperson said. In October, USwitch made the unusual decision to advertise to customers that they should “stay put” with their current providers and stop using its energy service until further notice. “It’s something we never thought we’d say,” a statement from the company said at the time. The comparison sites also face the challenge of new rules banning loyalty penalties on home and motor insurance. The regulations, set by the Financial Conduct Authority, came into effect on 1 January, and state that anyone renewing their policy with an existing provider should pay no more than they would as a new customer. Prices for customers who switch regularly have gone up, while those who stay with their providers now pay less. At the time these rules were first announced, shares in Moneysupermarket and GoCompare’s parent company fell, and experts suggested that the incentive to shop around for insurance would reduce once the changes had bedded in. Rising interest rates also mean the disappearance of some of the best deals on loans and mortgages. Danni Hewson, financial analyst at AJ Bell, said the companies needed to evolve to get through the rough patch. “They have enjoyed huge success because they’ve become an essential tool but can that tool do more to help us buy time in our increasingly busy and costly lives?” she asked. One way to do this would be focus the business on areas where consumers are still keen to shop around and where they still stand to save money. “Many people are desperate to get away, but our collective confidence has been knocked by changing restrictions during Covid and many people will be hunting out protection before they even start looking for their holidays,” Hewson said. “Travel is expected to be a big money maker for price comparison sites this year, along with broadband business which has become increasingly important as our homes become more and more connected. “And whilst that business is unlikely to cover all the losses from the energy side it should help cushion the blow.” MoneySupermarket has already laid out plans to recoup its losses – including sending customers prompts when savings could be made on products. “While it’s true that wholesale energy prices mean there are no competitive energy deals for consumers to switch to for now, there are numerous other ways we help consumers save on their household bills,” a spokesperson said. “In recent months, we are seeing much more switching on borrowing and banking products, as well as travel insurance. So the ways consumers can save with us is increasing, and we are investing in our site and systems to make it easier to do so.” It said it would be adding car insurance comparison to MoneySavingExpert, which it owns. It also recently bought the cashback site Quidco, which offers a range of ways to save money on products via the site. It was added to the company in November. USwitch said, too, that there were still products which people could save on. “Mobile and broadband customers who are out of contract will likely be able to find a better deal elsewhere,” a spokesperson said. “A quarter of people are estimated to have let their broadband lapse, meaning that millions of consumers are missing out on the best deals and overpaying.” However, it advised customers to “start the process by haggling directly” with current providers in order to negotiate a better deal before turning to them for a switch. Ultimately though, the energy price challenge facing most comparison sites will come to an end and when it does, experts said the switching market would recover. Giles Thorne, financial analyst at the Jeffries Group, said that the lack of cheap energy tariffs was a “temporary rather than a structural phenomena”. However, he admitted “the timing of a return in revenue is uncertain”. AJ Bell’s Danni Hewson added: “Energy business will have to come back. Consumers and companies alike won’t cope if tariffs stay elevated in the long term.” She said consumers had got used to relying on comparison websites when looking for deals. “Many people feel these sites are essential middlemen, even if they’re making the money from supplying companies with our business,” she said. “We want control and we want choice and just being able to compare one product with another can help us understand what it is we really need and what we are prepared to pay for.”",Lifestyle/Money,Soaring energy prices leave UK comparison sites stranded,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/20/soaring-energy-prices-leave-uk-comparison-sites-stranded
2/20/2022,"There are many individual battles that tell the story of Vladimir Putin’s Russia, but few can have quite the fairytale resonance of Natalya Sindeyeva’s. A dancer as well as a defiant truth-teller, Sindeyeva has lived a life that feels a bit back to front: she first married her handsome prince and then all her struggles began. Sindeyeva’s wedding took place at the Peterhof Palace in St Petersburg in 2006. She was the founder and voice of a celebrated non-stop music radio station and a fixture in style magazines; her new husband, Alexander “Sasha” Vinokurov, was part of the fabulously wealthy post-communist oligarchy, the young multimillionaire head of an investment bank who lived on a great estate outside Moscow. The celebration at the Peterhof involved a performance by dancers from a prominent ballet company, with Sindeyeva taking the lead. When that party ended, it seemed she might float away to any make-believe she chose.  What she decided to do was this: she would create an independent television channel that championed what she saw as a new youthful exuberance in Moscow society. The station, Dozhd, or TV Rain, would be drenched in attitude as much as news values and billed as “the optimistic channel”. Sindeyeva, with her fantasy lifestyle and her bright pink Porsche Cayenne, was determined to inject some of her life-loving energy into the restricted landscape of Russian state media. The promotional launch of the new channel featured her dancing barefoot on a rooftop in the rain. Those chapters of her story are the opening scenes of a new documentary about Sindeyeva and TV Rain called F@ck This Job, which was the headline act of last year’s Artdocfest in Moscow. The director of the festival, the veteran film-maker Vitaly Mansky, describes succinctly what happened next: “When Natalya started her journey with the Dozhd TV channel, she was naive enough to believe that it was possible to create independent, light and, let’s say, glamorous television in Russia,” he says. “Instead, this innocent young woman drove her Porsche into a war zone and her glamorous car got very dirty and hit by shrapnel.” The documentary, which opens in UK cinemas this week and will be shown next month on the BBC, has been made by Vera Krichevskaya, who was among Sindeyeva’s first hires as an editor in the TV Rain newsroom. (“Natalya knew nothing about news,” Krichevskaya tells me. “She came from showbusiness.”) The film examines all the ways that Sindeyeva’s irresistible optimism went head to head with the Kremlin’s cynical authority. For a while, TV Rain was tolerated by the censors and included on all the digital broadcasting platforms. Peter Pomerantsev, author of the seminal book about Russian media manipulation, Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible, recalls that time to me in this way: “There was a moment when it seemed that just maybe the future of Russia would not be determined by these crazy KGB guys. At that moment, TV Rain and Sindeyeva seemed to have the zeitgeist, improvised and hipsterish – they represented that reforming, optimistic tone. Not many voices in Russia ever say ‘We can change things’, but they were very much the hub of that possibility.” Sindeyeva’s hopes for that new Russia rested on Dmitry Medvedev, who was president, in name at least, alongside prime minister Putin from 2008 and in some ways a modernising force who looked to build relationships in the west. After the 2012 presidential election, however, when Medvedev was replaced by Putin, who had forced changes to the constitution to enable himself to return to power, that hope disappeared. With mass protests over rigged elections on the streets of Russian cities, Sindeyeva had a choice to make: which side are you on? TV Rain sent its reporters out to give live-streamed reports of the protests that were being ignored on the national news. Several reporters were arrested and continued coverage on their mobile phones from the back of police vans. That anarchic spirit went on to inform the ways in which TV Rain covered all subsequent opposition demonstrations, as well as events in Chechnya and Ukraine (the title of the documentary, F@ck This Job, comes from a live phrase uttered by a lone frontline reporter when he came under fire from Russian-backed troops during the 2013 democracy riots in Kyiv). The station became, too, a vocal champion of LGBTQ+ rights at a time when laws were introduced making the public expression of same-sex relationships illegal. In predictable response, Putin’s state set about intimidating Sindeyeva and slowly starving TV Rain of its audience. The station was, overnight in 2014, removed from cable networks and digital packages (after the broadcast of a discussion programme, which was deemed “anti-patriotic”, about whether surrender at the siege of Leningrad would have changed the course of the second world war). Its regular audience of 10 million collapsed. In a period when the murders of dozens of investigative journalists were left unsolved, however, the channel continued to resist efforts to silence it and created an online platform with a subscription model. When its headquarters were shut down and no one would offer studio space, it broadcast for a time from Sindeyeva’s apartment. Last week, I spoke to Sindeyeva in that apartment about TV Rain’s long decade and about her continuing efforts to make it a small – and optimistic – voice of truth. By Zoom from Moscow she still wears the smile that illuminated her wedding videos, but the wide-eyed innocence that accompanied it has been replaced by a far wearier edge of experience. She recently turned 50 and the last couple of years have been particularly tough for her. She announced live on her own TV Rain show in February 2020 that she had breast cancer and was taking some time off for treatment and surgery. Since then, her marriage to Sasha, partner in all her adventures, has ended. Meanwhile, the attacks on TV Rain have intensified. In August last year, she and her staff were officially declared a “foreign agent” by the Kremlin. Last month, Putin’s thuggish stooge in Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, denounced the station’s journalists as “terrorists” who should be “destroyed”. Most recently, the state ordered that all TV Rain’s archived coverage of opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s investigations into high-level corruption must be destroyed. With translation help from a TV Rain editor, Sindeyeva talks me through some of these latest trials. “We definitely are entering a different landscape,” she says. “I guess it really started from the jailing of Navalny last year. Every time we think it cannot get worse, it gets worse. Many journalists have left the country recently, other people, just associates of Navalny’s organisation, have been arrested. Putin is always moving the borders of what is allowed…” When she was classed as a foreign agent, Sindeyeva responded with an open letter stating: “Rain is almost 200 people who, just like me, love their country, cheer for it and want Russia to become better – more humane, safer, fairer, more honest, richer, freer. And I’m sure the approximately 20 million people who watch and read us on different platforms every month want the same thing as we do. You can joke as much as you like about the status of ‘foreign agent’ and call it a ‘seal of excellence’. But, in fact, all this is terrible. It is quite awful when the state divides people into ‘friends’ and ‘strangers’.” The latest round of attacks escalated her sense of personal threat that came after the murder of the opposition leader Boris Nemtsov in 2015. That event, she has recalled elsewhere, “brought the physical feeling of fear. There had been warning signs before – a car following me after one of our stories came out, things like that. But when Nemtsov was killed, it became an existential fear. You start thinking to yourself, ‘Well, how long will they wait before killing someone else?’” In the face of that, I wonder if Sindeyeva has been surprised by her own courage, by her determination to stay in Moscow and keep TV Rain alive… She smiles. “To be honest, that has surprised me. I found out many new things about myself in the past few years. I always believed I was an open-hearted person, with a strong sense of justice. But I didn’t really think that I was brave. I keep on asking myself: why are you not afraid? And my answer to that question is that I have no choice. That gives me a sense of enormous calm. There is no fear. I don’t think I am a hero, though Dozhd does some heroic things.” Krichevskaya’s film portrays this growing resolution beautifully. “I have to be honest,” says Krichevskaya, who is now based in London. “I didn’t consider either Natalya or her husband were serious people to start with. I wasn’t interested in their opinion on politics or stuff in the news. But later, especially after the Leningrad siege scandal, I started understanding that they had changed. They were always driven by justice. Sure, they didn’t always have a clear political agenda. But what was most important for them? To be honest.” Krichevskaya describes the golden couple as products of the “fat years” of wild prosperity among the Russian elite before the global financial crash of 2008. I wonder if their political awakening is rare among the oligarchs who benefited from that great windfall? “In Russia, this couple is completely unique,” she says. “Many oligarchs from different fields, they thought about Sasha as a really stupid guy who has allowed himself to be led by his wife, which is completely unacceptable in Russia.” The film details how, over successive years, that journey cost Natalya and Sasha and their two children almost everything. The had to sell the big estate and the glass-walled mansion as they poured their money into keeping TV Rain alive. It must, I suggest to Sindeyeva, have been a very hard thing to watch that happen again on a screen having lived through it? “Those decisions weren’t so hard,” she says. “Because when we were selling our house, the audience for the channel was growing. We didn’t see it as some sort of a tragedy.” She describes the decision to end their marriage last year as a mutual one, brought about in part by the pressure of running the business. “Both of us were unhappy,” she says of the last act of that fairytale. “But we are still friends. We keep on talking to each other. And perhaps we didn’t totally close that door.” One compensation has been that she still has her family in the newsroom at TV Rain to rely on. Even after her successful cancer treatment she sees no separation between work and home. “If ever somebody leaves Dozhd, they’re still part of my family. I think of them all as ‘raindrops’. We’ve been through a lot and are all part of this bigger thing.” Have there been moments when she thought of giving up? “The main crisis was when the cable operators just switched us off,” she says. “And there was a moment when I wanted to quit everything. That was the day when our landlord in the Red October district, in the very centre of Moscow, said that we were no longer allowed to work there. But that despair lasted, I guess, for 24 hours or so.” Since then, she says, no doubt just as the state intended, the frustrations have been drip-fed, as the station has become more isolated. The dangers then become that “we are tired of each other and we tired of the war that was going for so long”. The latest episode in that war is the film itself. The preview screenings gave something of a taste of the political climate in which it is being released, in which Putin seems determined to silence all opposition in advance of his move to secure power for a further 12 years after the 2024 elections. The Artdocfest was disrupted by a series of threats and protests from violent pro-Kremlin activists and anti-gay protesters, who broke up the screening of films about Chechnya and Ukraine. Mansky was physically assaulted by one thug, but the festival director persisted with the sold-out screening of F@ck This Job. The film gets a wider release in Russia next month, with a series of screenings that will be attended by Sindeyeva and Krichevskaya. I suggest to the director that it seems a particularly significant and precarious moment for that short tour, not least because the presentation of TV Rain’s vibrant newsroom reminds viewers both at home and abroad what an alternative vision of what Russia could look like… “One of my big motivations to make this film for a western audience,” she says, “was to tell you guys that despite what you see on the news, we are not freaks, not all of us. I live in London and my children go to school here. After each recent crisis, it has been easier for me to tell the other school mothers that we’re from Ukraine rather than Russia, just to avoid questions. Some people can’t imagine that we might be normal and live in a free way. The cliche of Russia is so bad.” I ask how the audience responded to the film when it was first shown last year, and Krichevskaya’s voice chokes a bit with emotion. “I got hundreds and hundreds of letters and emails from professionals, from media, saying that it represented all their stories. Afterwards, everyone was crying. People want to cry together about our hopes, why we didn’t achieve what we wanted…” She says that for the first time in her life, she saw Sindeyeva lost for words. When I ask Sindeyeva about that moment on our Zoom call, she falls silent for a moment again as she collects her thoughts. “One thing was,” she says eventually, “that ever since 2014 all the state propaganda is always doing some fake news about Rain or about me. Saying that we are owned by Americans, or Ukrainians, making personal attacks.” Watching herself on film dancing with Sasha, seeing herself having scans for her cancer, reminded her, she suggests, not only of all the lies that had been told but of the sacrifices they had made. “I guess there is a large number of people here who believe the lies,” she said. “But there are also thousands of people who have stayed loyal to us.” And what about her optimism, had that survived the decade? “I’ve always been optimistic and I’m still optimistic,” she says. “For me, this means that there is always some hope, that the good guys will take over eventually. But also there is one more important thing to say about that. Optimism is not dreaming, it also says, ‘Get your ass up from the chair and try to make things happen.’” F@uk This Job (Tango With Putin) is in UK cinemas from 24 February.

2/20/2022,"In the 12 years since the gorgeous Teen Dream brought their hazy, heavy dreampop to wider renown, Beach House have refined and tweaked their formula across four albums, reaffirming rather than reinventing. Their first self-produced record (with engineering assistance from Alan Moulder and Dave Fridmann), and the first to benefit from the wild richness of a live string section, Once Twice Melody was released serially. It phases through different moods across its four chapters, with dominant hints of Love-like, dark-tripping folk-rock and a more electronic psychedelia reminiscent of Broadcast. The title track opens with an aloof feel, Victoria Legrand keeping close, mysterious harmony with herself. Runaway brings the duo back to their most seductive by Chapter 2, with pulsing beats and brittle, harpsichord-like keys. Masquerade hits an overtly goth-rock high point in Chapter 3 before the final songs fade out slowly in a warm, golden-hour nostalgia, closing at last with the stately cosmic darkness of Modern Love Stories. It’s testament to the structure and variety of Once Twice Melody that it never lags over 18 tracks, its gradual release paradoxically validating the album format as one still worth surrendering to, totally.

2/20/2022,"It is a chamber of the mind, a room of one’s own, a hothouse or a prison. It is an attic or an empty shop, a suburban lockup or a concrete cubicle in a disused acid factory that still takes coins for the meter and is a million miles from the white cube factory designed by architects where assistants manufacture blue-chip art for the rich. Yet they are all known, because of who goes there, and what they make, which may be something or a paralysed nothing whatsoever, as artists’ studios. A show with this theme opens at the Whitechapel Gallery next week. And it turns out be a riveting experience, achieved with great wisdom and drama by Iwona Blazwick and her team. A Century of the Artist’s Studio goes in and out of this magical place in such inventive ways. There are spectacular reconstructions of actual studios – Matisse’s bedroom in the south of France, hung with magnificent embroideries; Kurt Schwitters’s Dada studio, all wild wooden stalactites – but the show also moves through global space, crossing five continents from the secret studios of Iran to the tiny kiosk in Manila where the father of Filipino art, Roberto Chabet, made conceptual sculptures.  The century flows through the show like an underground river. Egon Schiele sets up his drawing box in the office of a prisoner of war camp in 1916. Ten years later, Brancusi is labouring through the dark night in his Paris attic. Frida Kahlo, torso in plaster, works from her sickbed in the second world war while Picasso sets up studio in the 60s in a majestic French castle. Cindy Sherman makes herself up, character by character, in her Manhattan loft in the late 1970s, the flashbulb wire visibly trailing across the floor. In Johannesburg, William Kentridge doubles up to play two versions of himself on screen, arguing about the value of political art in the digital 21st century. In films, photographs and paintings, the studio edges in at every turn. It is a place of cigarette butts and congealing palettes, the masking tape running out as the daylight fades too fast and the leg of the drawing table needs propping yet again. It is a place where the clock ticks with reproachful violence as no work gets done in Darren Almond’s live feed of his studio. Where the canvases are still worryingly bare, in an exquisite tempera painting by Andrew Grassie (perfect paradox). Or the paintings have all gone, along with the students, in Paul Winstanley’s photographs of deserted art schools, haunted by telltale hints of colours the decorators have tried to cover over with whitewash. The studio is a place of heroics. The heap of paint rags in Lucian Freud’s Holland Park studio, so lovingly depicted in the enormous portrait of his assistant, becomes a sacred relic in Darren Almond’s photographic homage. The rags in Robert Rauschenberg’s studio appear almost erotic in their sprawled abandon, photography by his friend Cy Twombly. And there are hints of Twombly’s own paintings of high summer in the luminous dabs blossoming across the walls of Francis Bacon’s studio, where he has wiped the excess of mauve, blue, pink and black from his brush. There is a fascination in seeing his colours isolated like this, and even more in the presentation of photographs found in that studio. It is sometimes said that Bacon couldn’t draw and relied almost entirely on photos. This feels like the ocular proof. The show teems with revelations. A startling 1925 shot of Alexander Rodchenko making photomontages in his Moscow studio looks fantastically advanced, except that he is wearing gaiters. Giacometti’s painting of his studio, so spectral and sketchy, looks so like the photographed reality – diaphanous shadows, walls scribbled with sketches – as to confuse art and life. And a lifesize log cabin – a facsimile of her Nova Scotia home – shows that the Canadian artist Maud Lewis painted everything she loved upon everything she owned: birds, flowers and trees trail right across the walls and windows. So many of the artists in this exhibition never had a separate studio. I am reminded of the great Cuban painter Carmen Herrera, who died last week at the age of 106, still painting dazzling abstractions in a room of her flat. A studio can be a floor, a hall or a kitchen, like the one shared by several artists in Iran, where the bowls of food look just like the bowls of paint. Studios may bring privacy and peace. A beautiful painting by Wilhelmina Barns-Graham shows the perfect easel in the perfect studio, rectilinear, formal, everything in its place – the Platonic ideal. But studios may also be the stage for performing, throwing parties or fighting with art. A terrific painting by Maria Lassnig shows the Austrian artist literally struggling to get into – or is it out of – a newly primed canvas. The studio becomes a place of pilgrimage. There are classic photographs here of Picasso painting for the cameras in Antibes, his masculinity barely concealed by a toga; and Jackson Pollock hard at it outside his Long Island barn for Hans Namuth to memorialise on film. This act of painting – this solo feat, this battling with one’s demons – is gleefully satirised by Paul McCarthy in his violent video Painter, in which McCarthy plays a clownish child lugging giant tubes of paint around his studio-cum-nursery. Painting is not so much heroic as a monstrous display of infantile male tantrums. Women alternate with men, here, to coruscating contrast. The American painter Helen Frankenthaler, photographed by Gordon Parks, sits with poised intelligence upon one of her own canvases, in command of her art. The young African American artist Mequitta Ahuja paints herself hemmed in between easel, mirror, canvases and art history, but breaking free of the past. And the whole show opens with one of Louise Bourgeois’s monumental caged Cells, all working hands multiplied in mirrors: a dynamic studio of the mind. The studio, always a subject in itself, becomes increasingly central with time. Joseph Sudek was reduced to photographing nothing but his bare Prague studio, first under Nazi occupation and later Soviet dictatorship. Gregor Schneider’s German family home has been both studio and source of his terrifying films and installations for three decades (he is said to have once remarked that he might have been a murderer if he hadn’t been an artist). And the Polish artist Mirosław Bałka has made art, piece by piece, from and in the house where he works outside Warsaw, inherited from his father. One of the last works here is a wooden angel beautifully sculpted from their fence and garden gate. Bałka’s forebears made funeral monuments, just to complete the elegiac metaphor. This is Iwona Blazwick’s last show as Whitechapel director – she departs in April – and it is fittingly superb. She changed the whole nature of the gallery, turning it into a multi-part museum with a special welcome for the local community and for artists of all ages. Blazwick has presided over many great exhibitions, but I doubt the rooms have ever been more densely and revealingly used than they are here. Go if you possibly can. This is nothing less than a history of art by other means; a magnificent way of entering the minds of artists through the places where they worked, and what they made there.

2/20/2022,"The British Olympic Association wants a harsher ban imposed on Russia if it can be proved that its sporting system deliberately doped the 15-year-old skater Kamila Valieva. Speaking at the end of the Beijing Games, which ended with a gold medal at last for Britain in the women’s curling, the BOA chief executive Andy Anson described Valieva’s treatment as “horrific” and revealed it had lobbied the International Olympic Committee to investigate the skater’s entourage one or two days before the IOC decided to act.  Russia was officially banned from the Winter Olympics, although it was allowed to compete under the banner of the Russian Olympic Committee. But Anson indicated that his organisation would back a stiffer punishment if a wider investigation proved Russia wrongdoing. “The Valieva stuff is horrific,” said Anson. “I don’t think we can pretend that it’s anything other than that. The investigation into everyone around her needs to be thorough and go as deep as it possibly can because what happened there was just completely unacceptable.” Valieva’s doping case dominated these Games after her positive test for the banned heart drug TMZ was reported a day after she inspired the Russians to team skating gold. She was then allowed to continue competing by the Court of Arbitration for Sport but, under the most severe pressure, she fell twice in the individual figure skating and finished fourth. To make matters worse, Valieva was then scalded by her coach, Eteri Tutberidze, as she left the ice in tears – something the IOC president Thomas Bach condemned the next morning. “I have to say I’ve found the IOC very open,” added Anson. “We’ve had discussions. We were pushing at the beginning that the entourage needed thoroughly investigating and a day or two that’s what came out. It sounded like they listened.” And when asked whether he supported a unilateral ban on Russia, Anson added: “The Sochi doping was clearly systematic and covered the whole team. “That deserved to be punished. We were very frustrated by the Cas ruling that reduced the ban from four to two years. I still can’t understand the logic of reducing that. If the investigation into Valieva found that this was part of a sporting system that was doping this deliberately, of course we’d support a harsher ban.” Anson said he was also open to a review of age limits in the wake of the Valieva case to protect vulnerable children. “This a global story and a pretty awful one,” he added. “The IOC and everyone involved has to act and push this thing as far as they can. It’s not easy. I was on the tennis tour when there was the match-fixing scandal in Poland, and we tried to get to the bottom of that in Russia and the policemen who were leading that decided they would not be around if they carried on that investigation. “But we have to push it as far as we can and make sure we get to the bottom of it.” Anson also admitted that if Britain was going to call other countries out for doping, it also had to be tough on its athletes who committed anti-doping rule violations. “If we’re going to sit here and criticise the Russians for the Valieva case we need to be as tough as possibly can be when doping happens in the UK,” he said when asked about GB losing its Tokyo 4x100m relay silver medal after CJ Ujah was found to have banned drugs in his urine. “If it was down to me personally, someone found guilty of a doping offence would never compete for Team GB again. I’m not sure legally I’d always win that battle but that’s how I feel about it. We want to send out the clearest possible message that it’s unacceptable.” Anson also praised Team Bruce Maout and Team Eve Maout, who won men’s curling silver and women’s curling gold, as Britain finished 19th in the Beijing medal table. “They have really kept us going and happy and positive,” he added. “The gold medal is just the icing on the cake after a long, long time away from home and it’s been well deserved.”",Sport/Sport,‘Horrific’: BOA chief backs harsher ROC ban if Valieva was deliberately doped,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/20/horrific-boa-chief-harsher-roc-ban-kamila-valieva-deliberately-doped-winter-olympics-beijing
2/20/2022,"Russian troops sent to Belarus for military exercises will remain in the country indefinitely, Belarus’s defence ministry has said, in a decision that will further fuel concerns Moscow is planning an imminent Ukraine invasion. Belarus’s defence minister, Gen Viktor Khrenin, said Russian soldiers would stay after large-scale joint drills were completed on Sunday. He said the move was necessary because of the “escalation of the situation” in the Donbas, in the east of Ukraine.  The Kremlin had promised to remove its forces from Belarus once the 10-day exercise, which began on 10 February, ended. It has deployed what the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said was the largest concentration of soldiers and modern weapons in Belarus since the cold war. They include 30,000 combat troops, elite Spetsnaz units, Su-35 fighter jets and S-400 missile defence systems. Russian forces are stationed close to the Belarus border and within striking defences of Kyiv 160 miles away. The US and UK have warned Moscow is planning to attack the Ukrainian capital. “In connection with the increase in military activity near the external borders of the Union State and the escalation of the situation in the Donbas, the Presidents of the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation decided to continue the joint inspection of response forces,” the statement by Belarus’s ministry of defence said. As recently as Wednesday Belarus’s foreign minister, Vladimir Makei, said “not a single” Russian soldier would remain in the country after the massive joint drills – a promise echoed by Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, repeated his claim on Sunday that Russia had no plans to launch a military offensive. “We urge you to ask yourself the question: what is the point of Russia attacking anyone?,” Peskov told the state-run Rossia 1 TV. Peskov added that Russia had “never attacked anyone throughout its history”. But he warned that “any spark, unplanned incident or minor planned provocation” in the Donbas region might lead to what he called “irreparable consequences”. The troop announcement follows what Ukraine’s government says is a coordinated spike in violence in the east of the country, where Ukrainian soldiers and pro-Russian separatists face off across a 260-mile (421km) frontline. Since Thursday, Ukrainian positions have come under intense bombardment. Ukraine’s joint forces command said that by 1pm local time on Sunday 27 artillery strikes had been launched against 10 Ukrainian-controlled villages and towns. It blamed the “provocative shelling” on Russia’s armed forces. Two Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Saturday and five wounded, it added. Separatists from the Luhansk peoples republic (LPR) have claimed they are under Ukrainian attack. On Sunday, they said two civilians had been killed near the village of Pionerskoye. “Unfortunately, as a result of the aggression of the Kiev militants, two civilians died and five residential buildings were destroyed,” the LPR said. Ukraine’s operational command dismissed the report as “an absolute fake” and said troops had been given orders to refrain from any “active action”. “We realise that the Russians are now looking for any excuse to invade,” it said, adding that it was closing several crossing points with rebel territory because of hostile fire. The Biden administration, Boris Johnson, among others, have said they believe Russia is behind a series of recent “false flag” events, designed to give Moscow a pretext to invade. They include a car bomb on Friday outside the separatist administration building in Donetsk, an “attack” on a water plant and a “shell” that landed across the border in Russia’s Rostov region. Марш єдності в Одеса. @radiosvoboda pic.twitter.com/zV7SFSPH28 The situation in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities remained calm on Sunday. Demonstrators took to the streets of the Black Sea port city of Odessa, waving blue and yellow Ukrainian flags. They shouted slogans including “Glory to Ukraine” and “Putin is a prick”. Meanwhile, the Dutch foreign ministry said it was moving its embassy from Kyiv to the western city of Lviv. “Due to security reasons, we have decided today to move the activities of the embassy to Lviv,” it said in a statement. The US and UK have already moved their missions to Lviv, with other European countries following suit. The French ambassador in Kyiv said on Saturday he was staying put. The political analyst Artyom Shraibman said the decision to keep Russian troops in Belarus was expected. He described Belarus’s president, Alexander Lukashenko, as “completely dependent on what Putin wants. “Lukashenko is forced to dance to Putin’s tune,” he said. He added: “Lukashenko won’t be happy that he is being used, but he will hope that Belarus might get something in return from Russia. Potentially a new credit or new weapons deal. The Belarusian leader doesn’t have any real allies left. “This shows that Lukashenko is very vulnerable at the moment, he has to play along with Putin’s bigger games.”",News/World news,"Russian troops will remain indefinitely, says Belarus, as fears rise of Ukraine invasion",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/20/russian-troops-will-remain-indefinitely-says-belarus-as-fears-rise-of-ukraine-invasion
2/20/2022,"Is it time for champagne? I think it might be. I always used to get excited by Charbonnel et Walker’s Marc de Champagne truffles, £16/135g, which were part pudding, part chocolate. But London Chocolates’ champagne truffles are a new favourite with smarter, for me, credentials: single-origin Tanzanian cocoa, Taittinger champagne and a bit of cognac, all in Jersey cream, £18/250g. A beautiful, clean snap to the dark chocolate with a sensational centre. Very grown up.  Pump Street’s new 44% single-farm Togo Swiss Milk, £6.25/70g, is a gold-star bar, which has become my new favourite from Pump Street (which I think of as my local chocolatiers since we are both in Suffolk). With beans from Togo, the first time Pump Street has used cocoa beans from Africa, and from a small co-operative of 100 smallholders. It’s got that lovely, creamy, treaty milk chocolate taste that we all need in February. Lastly, Palm Chocolate are all date/nut-based, with no refined sugar. Ideal if your new year’s resolutions are going strong, but also if you just sometimes like, as I do, a little box of chocolates that has more wholesome ingredients. I tried both the Restore and Balance boxes, £12 each, with six bonbons a piece (listen: I take my research seriously) and absolutely loved them. It’s super dark chocolate (100% Madagascan) around squidgy dates, with added ingredients, including nuts, tahini, seeds and spices.
