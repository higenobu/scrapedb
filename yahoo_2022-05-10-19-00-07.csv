5/10/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) - Asked if Russia would rule out a preemptive tactical nuclear strike on Ukraine, Russia's deputy foreign minister said on Tuesday that a decision on the possible use of nuclear weapons was clearly set out in Russia's military doctrine, RIA reported. ""We have a military doctrine - everything is written there,"" Alexander Grushko was quoted by state news agency RIA as saying. Russia's official military deployment principles allow for the use of nuclear weapons if they - or other types of weapons of mass destruction - are used against it, or if the Russian state faces an existential threat from conventional weapons. The decision to use Russia's vast nuclear arsenal, the biggest in the world, rests with the Russian president, currently Vladimir Putin. Russia's invasion has killed thousands of people, displaced nearly 10 million, and raised fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and the United States - by far the world's biggest nuclear powers. U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns said on Saturday that Putin believes he cannot afford to lose in Ukraine and cautioned that the West could not ignore the risk of the use of tactical nuclear weapons by Moscow. ""We don't see, as an intelligence community, practical evidence at this point of Russian planning for a deployment or even use of tactical nuclear weapons,"" Burns said. He cautioned, though, that ""the stakes are very high for Putin's Russia."" NUCLEAR STRIKE? A decree signed by Putin on June 2, 2020, said Russia views its nuclear weapons as ""exclusively a means of deterrence"". It repeats the phraseology of the military doctrine but adds details about four circumstances under which a nuclear strike would be ordered. These include reliable information of a ballistic missile attack on Russia and an enemy's attack ""on critical state or military installations of the Russian Federation, the incapacitation of which would lead to the disruption of a response by nuclear forces."" Putin, who has repeatedly expressed resentment over the way the West treated Russia after the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, says Ukraine has been used by the United States to threaten Russia. He justified his Feb. 24 order for a special military operation by saying Ukraine had persecuted Russian speakers and the United States was keen to enlarge the NATO military alliance in a way that would endanger Russia. U.S. President Joe Biden casts Putin's invasion of Ukraine as a fight in a much broader global battle between democracy and autocracy. He has also called Putin a war criminal and has said the former KGB spy cannot remain in power. Ukraine dismisses Russian claims that it persecuted Russian speakers and says it is fighting for its survival. Russia denies Ukrainian and Western accusations that its forces committed war crimes.

5/10/2022,"A long-haul truck driver was arrested Saturday night on suspicion of raping a clerk at the motel he was staying at in Turlock. The incident occurred around 8:25 p.m. at the Days Inn on North Tully Road, said Turlock police Lt. Neil Cervenka. The suspect, 29-year-old Osman Mukhammadiyev, called the front desk to report an “equipment problem” in his room. A female employee responded to the room, where Mukhammadiyev allegedly restrained her and sexually assaulted her, Cervenka said. He said the victim was able to fight off the suspect, run back to the hotel office and call 911. Cervenka said officers quickly arrived at the scene and apprehended Mukhammadiyev as he was coming out of his room. He was arrested on suspicion of forcible rape, kidnapping to commit rape and false imprisonment. His bail is set at $670,000 and he has not yet been formally charged. A woman at the Days Inn who identified herself as the assistant manager declined to comment about the incident when contacted by The Bee on Monday. Cervenka said Mukhammadiyev is a long-haul trucker from Massachusetts who’d been staying at the motel for a few days. “We don’t know if he has ever been in this area before; we have no history at all with him,” the lieutenant said. “Investigators have a concern that this may have happened in other areas or states due the the nature of his job and the nature of the offense,” Cervenka said. “We urge anyone with information to come forward.” Anyone with information is asked to contact Detective Tony Argueta at 209-668-6538.",U.S./Modesto Bee,Turlock hotel clerk allegedly raped by guest who reported equipment issue in his room,https://news.yahoo.com/turlock-hotel-clerk-allegedly-raped-194600857.html
5/10/2022,"Republicans, like Gov. Ron DeSantis, want you to know that they believe in the First Amendment, unless you disagree with them. A clear-cut example of this is the Republican response to Disney's concerns about the “Don't Say Gay” law. Disney publicly disagreed with the law and exercised its First Amendment right. For its use of constitutionally protected speech, Disney was financially punished by Florida. An agreement that the state had in place with Disney since 1967 was shredded for political purposes in a matter of days. DeSantis is trying to score political points with the Republican base by attacking “woke” Disney, but his vindictiveness will ultimately fail. The courts will no doubt see his misguided actions as an abuse of power. Abe Lincoln said, “Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give him power."" Florida voters gave DeSantis power, and now we see his true character. Florida is known as a business-friendly state, but when Republican legislators direct their wrath at Disney, the state's largest employer, over a difference of opinion, then we must take Florida being a business-friendly state with a grain of salt.

5/10/2022,"By Andrew Hay ANGOSTURA, N.M. (Reuters) - Forests in Ella Arellano's family for nine generations burned in a day on Monday as fierce winds drove the United States' largest wildfire through a New Mexico valley towards a third county. Arellano sat in an evacuation center in Peñasco on Monday and grieved the loss of timbered mountainsides around her home in Holman after the fire leaped across the Mora valley about 40 miles (64 km) northeast of state capital Santa Fe. ""I'm of the land,"" said Arellano, a ""mayordoma"" in charge of irrigation channels known as ""acequias"", as she wiped away tears. ""Our mountains are gone and it's still burning."" The so-called Hermits Peak Calf Canyon fire, larger than the city of Chicago, has been contained to the east but is racing north through land that has deep religious significance to Indo-Hispano villages established two centuries ago. Around 35 miles in length, the blaze has destroyed hundreds of homes and other structures and triggered evacuation orders for 12,000 homes in San Miguel and Mora counties. After more than a month of wildfires, residents of Taos County on Monday for the first time were told to prepare to evacuate as the fire advanced towards the villages of Angostura and Tres Ritos as well as the Sipapu ski area around 15 miles south of the town of Taos. Winds gusting up to 66 mph blew a rancher off his feet as he hosed down his Angostura home in preparation for embers flying over a mile from the fire. He was in shock as a blaze that started 20 miles distant when a U.S. Forest Service controlled burn got out of hand on April 6 burned less than 5 miles away. A few miles down the road in Tres Ritos, ski area employees emptied belongings from a storage unit in preparation for a fire they believed was coming. ""They've been fighting it for a month in wilderness, they can't stop it,"" said Greg Payne, facilities maintenance manager at Sipapu ski area two miles down the valley. The fire has burned 189,767 acres (76,890 hectares) and is 43% contained.
