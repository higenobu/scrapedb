1/16/2022,"Ghislaine Maxwell has ended her fight to keep the names of eight ""John Does' sealed, her attorney said in a letter. The letter said that the listed ""Does"" has legal counsel to assert their ""own respective privacy rights."" It follows efforts by Prince Andrew accuser Virginia Giuffre's legal team to get the ""John Does"" identified. Ghislaine Maxwell will no longer fight to keep the names of eight ""John Does"" a secret, according to one of her attorneys. Lawyers for Jeffrey Epstein sex-trafficking victim Virginia Giuffre have asked a judge to unseal material from an earlier civil lawsuit she filed against Ghislaine Maxwell, reported MailOnline. In a letter to Judge Loretta Preska, which was published by LadBible, Maxwell's attorney Laura Menninger said Wednesday that her client will leave it to the court to decide whether the names should be unsealed. ""Each of the listed Does has counsel who have ably asserted their own respective privacy rights,"" the letter, submitted by Menninger, said. The fact that Maxwell, a longtime associate of Epstein, who was convicted of five sex-trafficking charges, is no longer opposing the unsealing does not necessarily indicate that all names will be released, the Independent reported. But it follows an effort by the legal team of Virginia Giuffre, who is suing Prince Andrew for allegedly sexually assaulting her, to get the ""John Does"" identified. ""Now that Maxwell's criminal trial has come and gone, there is little reason to retain protection over the vast swaths of information about Epstein and Maxwell's sex-trafficking operation that were originally filed under seal in this case,"" said Sigrid McCawley, a Giuffre attorney, according to a letter seen by the Independent. According to MailOnline, six of the ""John Does"" have objected to the sealing. One of them, John Doe 17, wishes to keep their identity secret to avoid ""annoyance and embarrassment,"" the media outlet reported. Another, ""John Doe 151,"" said that the disclosure of his name would lead to him being ""hounded"" by the media, and added that he wishes to maintain a ""private life,"" MailOnline said. The decision by Maxwell's legal team not to fight against the potential unsealing of name took place on the same day that a federal judge denied Prince Andrew's attempt to dismiss a lawsuit from Giuffre. As Insider's Jacob Shamsian reported, it was just one element of Prince Andrew's worst week yet.

1/16/2022,"Tucker Carlson has interviewed Thomas Caldwell three times since January 6. Caldwell has been indicted on charges of seditious conspiracy and faces up to 20 years in prison. Caldwell organized the Oath Keepers' quick reaction force teams, according to an unsealed indictment. Since the Capitol insurrection, Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson has repeatedly interviewed Thomas Caldwell, who was indicted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on Thursday on charges of seditious conspiracy for his role in coordinating the Oath Keepers' attack, Media Matters reported. Caldwell first joined ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" in October 2021. During his appearance, he said he never entered the Capitol and was not part of the Oath Keepers, a far-right, anti-government paramilitary organization, according to Media Matters. An FBI affidavit from January 2021 revealed the extent of Caldwell's participation in the insurrection through records collected from his Facebook account. ""Us storming the castle. Please share. Sharon was right with me! I am such an instigator! She was ready for it man! Didn't even mind the tear gas,"" Caldwell said in a Facebook message on the evening of January 6. ""We need to do this at the local level. Lets storm the capitol in Ohio. Tell me when!"" The affidavit also included several messages exchanged between Caldwell and two others accused of being his co-conspirators in the weeks leading up to January 6, including: ""Driving in with my wife from Berryville VA but am soending night before at Comfort Inn Arlington/Ballston on Glebe Road. Meeting up with Oathkeepers from North Carolina and Patriot group from the Shenandoah Valley."" ""This is a good location and would allow us to hunt at night if we wanted to. I don't know if Stewie has even gotten out his call to arms but its a little friggin late. This is one we are doing on our own. We will link up with the north carolina crew."" ""Paul has a room and is bringing someone. He will be the quick reaction force. Its going to be cold. We need a place to spend the night before minimum."" In the following months, Carlson continued to push a ""false flag"" narrative about the insurrection and interviewed Caldwell twice more on his Fox shows, once in November and again this past Thursday, following Caldwell's indictment by the FBI. According to the indictment, Caldwell was one of the coordinators of the Oath Keepers' quick reaction force teams on January 6, readying members to rapidly transport stockpiled firearms into Washington, DC, ""in support of operations aimed at using force to stop the lawful transfer of presidential power."" The indictment said Caldwell sent a text message on January 2 seeking out boats to ferry weapons across the Potomac River. ""If we had someone standing by at a dock ramp (one near the Pentagon for sure) we could have our Quick Response Team with the heavy weapons standing by, quickly load them and ferry them across the river to our waiting arms,"" Caldwell said, according to the indictment. If convicted, Caldwell faces up to 20 years in prison under the charge of seditious conspiracy, the Department of Justice said in a press release.

1/16/2022,"DUBAI (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates' civil aviation regulator has opened an investigation into an aborted take-off by an Emirates airline passenger jet this month at Dubai airport, the carrier said on Saturday. It is the second inquiry launched into the airline in less than a month, after another passenger jet in December did not immediately increase its ascent after take-off. The flight landed safely. An Emirates spokesperson said that safety is its top priority and there was no aircraft damage or any injuries as a result of the aborted take off from Dubai on Jan. 9. The jet, carrying passengers to Hyderabad in India, was instructed to ""reject take-off on departure"", which the spokesperson said was ""completed successfully."" The General Civil Aviation Authority's Air Accident Investigation Sector is investigating the incident, the spokesperson said. The airline is reviewing it too. FlightRadar24, a flight tracking website, has reported the Boeing 777 jet started its take-off while another 777 was crossing the runway. The take-off was aborted after the wide-body jet reached 100 knots, it said. The regulator is already investigating what Emirates has publicly described as a ""technical incident"" that took place on a Dec. 20 passenger flight from Dubai to Washington DC. Industry blog The Air Current, citing FlightRadar24, has reported the passenger jet did not immediately climb after it took off from Dubai, flying unusually low over a neighbourhood. The flight landed safely in the United States. The GCAA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the incidents.
