12/10/2021,"The saga of Geronimo the alpaca, who was culled by UK government officials because they believed he had bovine tuberculosis, has taken another twist after postmortem tests failed to provide conclusive findings about the animal’s health. Geronimo was killed in August after four years of court battles, protests and celebrity interventions, with the government insisting he had to die because he had twice tested positive for the disease.  His owner, Helen Macdonald, a veterinary nurse, argued that the testing process was flawed, and she and her supporters have been waiting for the results of complex postmortem tests, confident they would prove he was healthy. In the early hours on Friday the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) put out a statement revealing it had not been possible to complete the tests. It said: “The Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) has completed its culture testing work for the alpaca known as Geronimo, which tested positive for bovine tuberculosis (bTB) twice using highly specific tests. “In September, APHA specialist vets completed an initial postmortem examination of the animal, which revealed the presence of TB-like lesions. These have since been undergoing further testing to determine the source of infection. “APHA has today confirmed that it was not possible to culture bacteria from tissue samples taken at postmortem examination, meaning that it will not be possible to carry out whole genome sequencing in order to try to understand how the alpaca caught the disease. This does not mean the animal was free of bTB infection because it had previously twice tested positive using highly specific, validated and reliable tests.” A team of four vets supported by at least 10 police officers took Geronimo from his home at a farm in south Gloucestershire and drove him to an undisclosed location where he was killed. Supporters of Geronimo, known as the alpaca angels, some of whom camped on the farm to guard the creature, described how he made distressed noises as he was taken. The news of the tests will be greeted with anger and scepticism by Macdonald’s backers. But the chief veterinary officer, Christine Middlemiss, said: “This animal tested positive for bovine tuberculosis on two separate occasions using highly specific tests. Due to the complexity of the disease, further testing has not enabled us to use whole genome sequencing to try to understand how the animal became infected in the first place. “Our sympathies remain with all those with animals affected by this terrible disease, which devastates farmers’ livelihoods. It is important to remember that infected animals can spread the disease to both animals and people before displaying clinical signs, which is why we take action quickly to limit the risk of the disease spreading.” Defra said the additional bacteria culturing process carried out by APHA was not used to validate previous test results but instead to identify which strain of the disease was present and help inform decisions on testing other animals in the herd. It said the testing was carried out at APHA Weybridge, which it said was the leading centre in the world for the study of TB in animals. Defra said bTB was one of the most significant animal health challenges that England faced, costing taxpayers more than £100m each year. In 2020 alone, more than 27,000 cattle had to be slaughtered to curb its spread.",News/UK news,"Postmortem tests on Geronimo the alpaca inconclusive, Defra says",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/10/postmortem-tests-on-geronimo-the-alpaca-inconclusive-defra-says
12/10/2021,"Tasmania is set to host Ashes cricket for the first time with Cricket Australia expected to confirm its choice of Hobart over Melbourne for the fifth Test against England from 14 January. The ABC reported a deal with Cricket Tasmania and the Tasmanian government had been done on Thursday night with an official announcement from CA expected over the weekend.  The deal means the series finale will be played at Bellerive Oval, after the plug was pulled on the initial venue of Optus Stadium in Perth due to Western Australia’s tough border controls. Cricket Australia earlier this week called out for expressions of interest from its member states and territories, with Victoria’s MCG and the Tasmanian bid emerging as the leading contenders. Prime minister Scott Morrison had backed Hobart, which has never before hosted an Ashes Test and has not hosted Test cricket since 2016, while Tasmania’s premier Peter Gutwein had urged CA to “make history, not money” when making its decision. The Victorian government had suggested the MCG’s “claims were undeniable” as an alternative venue. The SCG in Sydney and Canberra’s Manuka Oval were also in contention, while Queensland and Adelaide opted not to bid. Among criteria on CA’s list for potential hosts was the ability to implement Covid-safe protocols, while commercial considerations were also taken into account. Another key, but not essential, requirement was a venue’s ability to stage a pink-ball match. The preference for a second day-night Test of this series – after next week’s Adelaide Test – has been interpreted as an olive branch to broadcasters, who had been counting on the match in Perth being played during prime time in the eastern states. CA made the call to put the series finale out to tender, rather than make a unilateral decision on the venue, given all six member associations are viewed as equal – each provides a director who sits on the CA board. Hobart had been confident of securing hosting rights, given it had lost last month’s postponed one-off Test against Afghanistan after CA made a stand against the Taliban’s views on women’s cricket. Bellerive Oval’s limited capacity of 20,000 – with Covid protocols reducing that further to 14,000 – did not count against its bid in the end. The MCG, which can hold 100,000, is already hosting its traditional Boxing Day Test from 26 December, although ticket sales have been slow.",Sport/Sport,Hobart set to host Ashes cricket for first time with decision on fifth Test imminent,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/10/ashes-fifth-final-test-host-decision-hobart-melbourne
12/10/2021,"Officials working on conservation matters in the New South Wales environment department have been barred from holding financial interests in the state’s biodiversity offset scheme. This follows an investigation of the department’s management of potential conflicts of interest.  Senior officials told a parliamentary inquiry on Friday that staff who work on the offset scheme or in the department’s biodiversity, conservation and science sections had been told they could not work in those roles and hold personal interests in properties and companies that were involved in the financial trade of offset credits. It follows two external investigations that were commissioned by the department after Guardian Australia uncovered a series of failures in offset programs. Offsets exist to allow developers to compensate for environmental damage in one area by delivering an equivalent environmental benefit in another. But there have been problems with the system, including in one case a 20-year delay in delivering environmental protection and so-called “double-dipping” by developers in areas of urban sprawl. Guardian Australia also revealed the state and federal governments bought tens of millions of dollars in offset credits from properties linked to consultants whose company advised the government on development in western Sydney. The reporting triggered a string of reviews, including one by the legal firm Maddocks and one by the consultancy Centium examining how the environment department had managed potential conflicts of interest associated with staff holding financial interests in offset sites. Guardian Australia has reported on one case involving a former staff member who bought land during their time in the department that went on to become an offset site from which the state government bought credits. There is no suggestion there was any impropriety involved. Dean Knudsen, the deputy secretary for biodiversity, conservation and science, told Friday’s hearing of the offset inquiry there had been fewer than five officials with such financial interests. After the reviews, the department has introduced a new conflict of interest protocol that deems some investments “high risk” and presenting an “unacceptable risk to the integrity” of the scheme. Knudsen said as a result, staff in certain sections could no longer participate in the scheme and those with historic interests had 12 months to divest. “For departmental staff we’ve effectively said you’re not supposed to be participating in the scheme,” he said. “If you have historically, we’ve told them what you have to do to effectively distance them from that.” The Greens MLC Cate Faehrmann, who is chairing the inquiry, said the changes were welcome. “This should have happened at the start of the scheme to help prevent the types of windfall gains by a few individuals with detailed knowledge of the offset industry,” she said. “However, we also need to see a tightening of conflicts of interest [rules] within the industry itself, including within ecological consultancies.” Officials were also asked about delays in securing permanent protection of offset sites to compensate for habitat destruction caused by coalmines in NSW. Responses to questions on notice in the parliament from the independent MLC Justin Field state that of the 41 coalmines approved in New South Wales in the past decade, one did not require offsets, 14 had not yet triggered the requirement to deliver their offsets, nine had land set aside but permanent protections were not yet in place, and 17 had “substantially finalised” their offsets. Field asked officials to explain what substantially finalised meant and was told for “all intents and purposes the offsets have been secured” but certain aspects – such as finalisation of some of the legal arrangements protecting the site – were outstanding. Officials agreed the process for securing offsets for mines had not been “as timely as [they] should be”. Field said it was not good enough that “not one single coalmine approved in the last decade has secured their required offsets through finalised in-perpetuity arrangements”.“The government needs to improve the transparency around what the hold-up is, put a deadline on finalising these arrangements and hold these mine operators to that deadline,” he said.",News/Australia news,NSW bars environment officials from holding financial interests linked to offset scheme ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/10/nsw-bars-environment-officials-from-holding-financial-interests-linked-to-offset-scheme
12/10/2021,"Australia is facing an “existential threat” to its democratic institutions from “mass influence” actors including Russia, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook, research for the department of defence has found. Commercial operations and foreign government agencies are collecting data to manipulate populations, spreading disinformation and propaganda, and in the worst cases, converting online activity into violence.  Defence commissioned a multi-disciplinary group from five universities to outline the scope of the problem as it works towards its own “counter-influence” capabilities. In Understanding mass influence: Three case studies of contemporary mass influence activities, researchers studied Facebook, Cambridge Analytica –the firm that harvested Facebook data to target American voters) – and the “troll farm” set up by Russia as the Internet Research Agency (IRA). The researchers studied the “grey zone threats” in space and cyberspace to understand the damaging effects of such mass influence campaigns. Among the recommendations is a suggestion that, to counter influence and illegal data harvesting, Australia will need to develop its own influence capabilities and improve its data collection. “A broad range of platform, user, usage, consumer, third party and campaign data will be required to develop, validate, and compare understanding of the reach, impact and effectiveness of influence campaigns and counter-campaigns over time,” is one of the recommendations. Defence’s Joint Capabilities Group’s head of information warfare, Maj Gen Susan Coyle, said in the context of a deteriorating strategic environment, traditional warfighting domains have evolved to reflect the changing environment. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “However, military modernisations, technological disruption, and the risk of state-on-state conflict are complicating Australia’s strategic circumstances,” she wrote. “Expanding cyber capabilities – and the willingness of some countries and non-state actors to use them – are further complicating Australia’s strategic environment. As one of Australia’s instruments of national power, Defence’s response to active interference, disinformation campaigns and economic coercion are a constant challenge.” Defence has outlined in its 2020 Defence Strategic Update and Force Structure Plan the importance of influence and grey zone threats and the need to counter them. The report emphasises that the views in it are the authors’, not those of the defence department. Academic lead, the University of Adelaide’s Professor, Michael Webb (Defence and Security Institute director), said actors were increasingly using cyber capabilities to influence populations “psychologically, politically and economically”. “We found that low levels of cybersecurity awareness, high levels of user credulity and strong incentives for organisations to seek to persuade, manipulate or coerce target audiences, contributed substantively to detrimental outcomes – intended or otherwise – for individuals and organisations,” he said. Webb said 50 academics across 14 disciplines from five universities created three “collegial” teams, and that they all felt strongly about the issue. “There’s a sense of existential threat we’re feeling around our democratic institutions, so we’re motivated to do what we can,” he said. Cambridge Analytica, for example, profiled and targeted individuals and groups to shift public opinion “at scale”. “It was a $20m investment by one guy who wanted to shift the Republican party further to the right … it’s undermining the fabric of our democracy,” Webb said. But more “terrifying” were the Russian interventions, which were successful in converting online interactions into offline violence and disrupting the 2016 US election. “The number of staff involved (up to 1,000), the diverse sets of skills, that is really a serious operation they’re mounting,” Webb said. “Their objective wasn’t to get (former US president Donald) Trump in, it was to undermine trust in democracy, and in western society. “They made some real inroads and we haven’t really come back from that.” The researchers found the Russian IRA was “motivated, uninhibited by laws or society norms, well-resourced and well-coordinated” at spreading disinformation and propaganda and turning opposing groups on each other in a way that could end in violence. (More detail on each case study will be released at a later date.) Facebook, meanwhile, is “likely to remain an efficient platform for propagating disinformation for the foreseeable future”. Webb said the teams’ work was to inform defence, which is working on its own Australian influence operations capability using cyberspace, artificial intelligence, and information warfare. “As a society I’m not sure we understand just how amazing and important democracy is. It’s precious but it’s precarious as well,” he said. “We always have differences of opinion. But that shouldn’t stop us from being able to have dialogue. Democracy supports that. If we allow ourselves to be fractured into echo chambers, that’s not a promising foundation for the future.”",News/Australia news,Cyberwarfare report: Australia’s democracy faces existential threat from ‘mass influence’ of foreign powers and social media,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/10/cyberwarfare-report-australias-democracy-faces-existential-threat-from-mass-influence-of-foreign-powers-and-social-media
12/10/2021,"Every autumn, Anil Kalyan, from Kutail village in India’s northern state of Haryana, would join tens of thousands of other paddy farmers to set fire to the leftover stalks after the rice harvest to clear the field for planting wheat. But this year, Kalyan opted for change. He signed his land up for a trial being held in Haryana and neighbouring Punjab as an alternative to the environmentally hazardous stubble burning that is commonplace across India and a major cause of Delhi’s notorious smog.  His 16 hectares (40 acres) were instead serviced by a tractor spraying an enzyme, which decomposes the stubble into useful fertiliser in just under a month. “We used to burn the stubble. We had no other solution for it. Burning caused quite a lot of problems – one was pollution, the second was the death of soil-friendly microbes, and the yield also reduced a lot. The costs incurred increased a lot every time we ploughed the field,” he says. “This [new solution] will benefit us a lot. It will reduce our cost, increase our yield severalfold, and reduce pollution to a great extent.” The crop-residue management programme, the largest ever project to eliminate stubble burning in India, hopes to end the scorching of more than 2.3m hectares (9,000 sq miles) of paddy fields annually. The scheme was conceived and led by nurture.farm, a digital platform for sustainable agriculture that was launched 18 months ago. More than 700 spraying machines were deployed across 17,000 hectares in 23 districts. More than 25,000 farmers took part in the experiment. Findings from the trial, published on Wednesday, found more than 1m tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions had been prevented. The enzyme, developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, increases organic carbon in the soil and maintains overall soil health. Nurture.farm used satellite pictures from the European Space Agency to find the farms that were burning fields. Stubble burning occurs globally, but particularly in India, the world’s largest rice exporter. The fires diminish nutrients in the soil as well as adding to air pollution. During the crop-burning season, the practice can account for up to 45% of Delhi’s pollution, according to government meteorologists. Dhruv Sawhney, chief operating officer at nurture.farm, says more than 70,000 farm fires were detected by satellite imagery in this year’s stubble-burning season in India. He says: “Stubble burning has now become a perennial issue because of a mismatch of policy and agricultural practices and, crucially, the lack of options available to farmers.” He wants to give farmers carbon credits for good agricultural practices, to sustain and scale up the project. The firm is launching a “sustainably grown rice” label so people can buy rice from the fields where burning no longer happens. “We’re also considering generating more carbon credits through introducing additional sustainable practices such as alternative wetting and drying [of rice paddies], which will save water and reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” says Sawhney. The programme will expand next year to cover about 800,000 hectares of land, roughly 40% of the area usually burned. Previous bans on stubble burning and threats of fines have done little to dissuade farmers, who see it as the only viable option to clear fields in the short period between two crops. Faced with farmers’ protests, the government decriminalised stubble burning in November. “If just by penalising farmers, stubble burning could be stopped, we should have been able to end it by now. We have evidence that in areas where alternatives are implemented, fire incidents have come down,” says Anumita Roychowdhury, head of the clean air programme at India’s Centre for Science and Environment, in the Hindu. “Penalty without access to solutions does not work,” Roychowdhury says.

12/10/2021," A second season for the supernatural epic starring Henry Cavill as Geralt of Rivia – a being with special powers and the kind of physique and bone structure that, in fantasy fiction world, can only indicate either great nobility or great evil. As we rejoin this sensitive monster-slayer, he’s in near exile after battle. But this allows world-building opportunities – tonight, we meet Geralt’s old friend Nivellen (Kristofer Hivju), a man cursed to live in a monster’s skin. The show does its best to explore these ideas as existential quandaries as well as adventure narratives. What does being a monster mean and what does it mean to kill them? Spectacular and portentous to the point of absurdity. PHNetflix, from Friday 17 December Making a snarky special about the minutiae of French motoring without leaving Blighty feels like one of the most defiantly old-school Top Gear moves imaginable. Although, to be fair to Clarkson, May and Hammond, there was the small matter of the pandemic standing in the way of foreign travel. The trio still manage plenty of their trademark irreverence and gratuitous destruction in the Welsh hills where this was filmed – in fact, once you’ve seen them drop a car from 500ft to test its suspension, you’ll understand that it’s business as usual. As ever, a TV phenomenon that implicitly smirks and sniggers at rational analysis. PHAmazon Prime Video, from Friday 17 December “Would I still grow to love you, even if I know how it ends?” There’s scripted reality and then there’s this. Arguably, it’s the opposite: unscripted unreality but still an attempt to carve a real-life narrative out of a deliberately artificial scenario. Two people who have never previously met are cast to live/act out a romantic storyline by enacting the events of a pre-written diary. Cue cute bonding scenarios – pushing a broken-down car, an idyllic day at the beach – and an eventual “breakup”. But will genuine infatuation take over? Bewildering and intriguing.

While we await the arrival of Selling Tottenham, we’ll have to make do with this: a brokerage based in Tampa, Florida, centring on the formidable Sharelle Rosado. “Get ready to make some money, bitches!” PHNetflix, from Wednesday 15 December Messy, cheerful, slightly cheesy comedy-drama exploring the tangled personal lives of multiple generations of the Diaz family as they negotiate the joys and pitfalls of romance. At the heart of the story are siblings Lily (Emeraude Toubia) and Jorge (Mark Indelicato) but expect to hear from parents and children, too. The narrative is framed by those emotionally overheated family occasions when getting up close and personal with your nearest and dearest is unavoidable – the holidays, the birthdays, the weddings and the funerals.

12/10/2021,"The latest wireless headphones from the Swedish company Urbanista hide an ingenious solution to battery life woes: solar charging. The Los Angeles cost £169 ($199/A$349) and look no different from a normal set of headphones, apart from a flexible Powerfoyle solar cell on top of the headband.  Fairly compact with simple, clean lines, they are available in either black or gold, the first of which helps the solar strip blend in the most. They feel solid and well made with a soft-touch finish, but are slightly heavier than the market-leading Sony 1000XM4. The headband is well padded, but they have some serious clamping force on the sides of your head, requiring a bit of stretching out on first wear. But at least they don’t move around when worn. The Los Angeles are standard Bluetooth 5.0 headphones supporting the universal SBC and AAC audio formats used by most devices, and maintained a solid connection to various Apple and Android devices. The right ear cup has three buttons for controlling playback and volume. Taking off the headphones also pauses the music. The left ear cup has a button for adjusting the noise-cancelling functions and a USB-C port for charging. They lack a 3.5mm headphone socket for using them without Bluetooth, which is irritating for use on a plane. But where the headphones really stand out is through battery life. Without the solar charging the headphones last a tremendous 80 hours on battery (50 hours with ANC on), which is far longer than most competitors. But the solar charging makes them last almost indefinitely unless you only use them in a darkened room. When the battery charge drops below 90%, the solar strip tops it up when exposed to sufficient sun or artificial light. In my time testing the battery never dropped below 50%, topping them up by leaving the headband facing a window when not in use. Weight: 320g Drivers: 40mm Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.0, USB-C and solar charging Bluetooth codecs: SBC, AAC Battery life: 50/80 hours ANC on/off Urbanista estimates that the battery will maintain in excess of 80% of its original capacity for more than 300 full charge cycles, but it is not replaceable nor are the headphones repairable, ultimately making them disposable. The headphones do not contain any recycled materials. The company does not offer trade-in or recycling, nor does it publish environmental impact assessments. The headphones have active noise-cancelling, which works well enough to dampen the drone of a plane engine or road noise, but struggles with higher pitched tones such as fans or speech. They beat most cheaper headphones but won’t trouble some of the market leaders, making them about right for the price. The ambient sound mode is fairly good too, allowing you to listen out for announcements or traffic, but struggles with wind noise. The headphones have a reasonably wide and expansive sound that handles tracks with plenty of energy. But the sound is skewed to the low end with plenty of well-controlled, punchy bass producing lower notes than most headphones can manage. Treble and high tones are pretty good, but will get squashed by the bass. There is no equaliser available to manually turn it down, sadly. Feed them some high energy electronica and they sound great, but less so with classical music or more nuanced tracks. Activating the noise-cancelling makes them sound slightly less wide, expansive and energetic. The announcements made when you switch on the headphones or change modes are too loud and can be quite shocking if you’re listening in a quiet space. Call quality is average with my end of the conversation sounding a little robotic even in quiet environments. The ear cups rotate to be flat and slide in the case, but do not fold up for travel. The Urbanista Los Angeles cost £169 ($199/A$349) and are available in black or gold. For comparison, the Urbanista Miami cost £129, Anker’s Soundcore Life Q35 cost £130 and the Sony WH-1000XM4 cost £249. The Urbanista Los Angeles are the first solar-charging headphones on the market and deliver on one thing above all else: almost limitless battery life. If you use them in bright environments you may only have to charge them once or twice a year, or not at all if they’re left facing daylight when not in use, which is remarkable. And they manage this solar feat while looking like a regular, tidy set of headphones. They sound good, but very bass-heavy with no adjustments available. The noise-cancelling is reasonable, but can’t touch market leaders. The Bluetooth connection and controls are good, but they lack a 3.5mm analogue headphones socket and crushed my ears a little. Despite their solar credentials, the headphones are not repairable and the battery is not replaceable making them ultimately disposable and losing them a star. Pros: solar charging, near-infinite battery life, Bluetooth 5.0 with SBC and AAC support, active noise cancelling, pumping bass and energetic sound. Cons: bass can override other tones, noise cancelling struggles with speech, call quality is not great, no 3.5mm analogue socket, tight fit, battery cannot be replaced, headphones not repairable.

12/10/2021,"People who travel to Ireland from Great Britain will be required to undertake daily lateral flow tests for five consecutive days after arrival, the Irish government announced on Thursday night. The tests will be in addition to the recently announced requirement that travellers to the republic have a negative PCR or lateral flow test before boarding a ferry or plane.  In a statement, the taoiseach’s office said that the first test should be taken on the day of arrival and, if any symptoms of Covid emerge or if a passenger has a positive result from a lateral flow test, they should seek a PCR test and self-isolate. The latest restriction has been put in place to mitigate the risk of a spread of the Omicron variant from Great Britain, where the number of cases has nearly doubled in one day after a further 249 cases were confirmed. Six cases of Omicron have been confirmed in Ireland. The Irish government said it was “taking account of relevant factors” following an “updated public health assessment in relation to the Omicron variant”. The restrictions will be a minor setback for the Irish diaspora in Britain where, unlike in Ireland, lateral flow tests are free and can be transported to the republic. They also highlight a different approach to the common travel area which normally allows the British and Irish to work, study, retire and holiday freely in either country without any restrictions or passport controls. Pre-departure and post-departure Covid tests required for international arrivals into Britain do not apply for travellers arriving from Ireland, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. Ireland’s approach to Covid has differed sharply from the UK with one of the longest lockdowns in the EU. Nightclubs were only reopened on 22 October and were closed again on Tuesday until the second week in January while the threat of Covid is assessed. Other restrictions include a four-household limit on mixing in a private setting.",News/World news,Travellers to Ireland from Great Britain must take Covid tests for five days,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/10/travellers-to-ireland-from-great-britain-must-take-covid-tests-for-five-days
12/10/2021,"The holiday season is a time of year beloved by many New Yorkers, but it also brings an occasion many dread: SantaCon. An annual event that sees some 30,000 people descend on New York, at its best Saturday’s SantaCon is a gathering of young people who donate some money to charity while wearing Santa Claus costumes and getting drunk.  At its worst, however – and SantaCon is frequently at its worst – the affair is an invitation for mass brawls, widespread street-vomiting, public fornication and loutishness. It wasn’t always this way. The modern-day SantaCon traces its origins to a less debauched, more purposed protest in Copenhagen in 1974. A group called Solvognen, which took its name from a Nordic Bronze Age sun chariot statue discovered in Denmark in 1902, held a four-day demonstration during which they entered a department store and began handing out books to confused shoppers. Solvognen was “an extraordinary Danish guerrilla theater troupe”, Mother Jones wrote three years later, with a longing for “a simpler Danish lifestyle, where American consumerism is not an envied standard”. Any children who happen to be on the streets this Saturday, when the modern-day SantaCon is occurring, are unlikely to receive this message – instead being presented with a chance to see their festive hero presented in an altogether unsavory light. Initially, the US adoption of Solvognen’s event stayed true to the anti-consumerism principles. That was implemented by the Cacophony Society, a San Francisco culture-jamming group, which held what was effectively the first US event in 1994. Inspired by the Solvognen action, a group of people took to the streets posing as Santas on strike. They bantered with locals and disrupted high society parties, aiming for “a little mocking of a bullshit holiday which was demonstrably based on an unholy alliance of religious hypocrisy and mercantile lust”, as Cacophony Society member John Law wrote in 2014. Later in the day Law, having checked no children were present, was ceremoniously hanged, in his Santa outfit, from a lamppost – “long after any tiny tots were tucked away in their warm beds”, he wrote. The group wanted to satirize the commercialization of Christmas, and, Law said: “With the SantaCon thing, it seemed to me that we had done just that. We took back the holiday from Macy’s, from Julius, from Jesus, from Coca-Cola.” According to the website for the New York SantaCon, the event has lost the angry, anti-commercialism meaning. “SantaCon is a charitable, non-political, nonsensical Santa Claus convention that happens once a year to spread absurdist joy,” the website says. In an email to the Guardian, SantaCon said it has raised $750,000 over the past 10 years. Attendees are alerted to the start point a couple of days before SantaCon, and tens of thousands of red-clad people usually appear. SantaCon isn’t unique to New York, with similar events taking place across the US and beyond, but it is the New York gathering that has garnered the worst reputation. Each year has been marked by vandalizing, public urination, vomiting and defecation, and some bar owners have boycotted the event, refusing entry to anyone wearing a Santa costume. In 2013, despite the New York police department launching a campaign against SantaCon, a group of half a dozen Santas, and apparently one elf, were filmed brawling in the street in Manhattan. The same year, footage of one of the attendees administering manual stimulation to a man in a Santa Claus outfit went viral. SantaCon was cancelled due to Covid-19 in 2020, but a year earlier the event featured a Santa urinating “in the middle of the McDonald’s in front of a child”, the New York Post reported, while Gothamist documented many less serious instances of Santas inspiring revulsion on public transport. In an email, SantaCon said the event has “has changed significantly for the better” in recent years. It added: “As with any event involving 30,000 people where alcohol is involved, there are always going to be individual situations of disruptive conduct.” “We agree that there is no excuse for inappropriate behavior including public drunkenness, urination, or rude behavior,” SantaCon said. “This is not only prohibited by the stated rules of the event, but actively discouraged by the crowds of Santas themselves, who are, for the most part, responsible, creative, community-minded New Yorkers. NYC Santa realizes that he has a responsibility to New York City and its citizens.” It is impossible to be certain what this year’s SantaCon holds, but given the weight of history, it is likely to be unpleasant for many, something hinted at in SantaCon’s own publicity. “Simple and effective way to have a merry SantaCon,” a SantaCon tweet read. “The 6 ‘F’s of SantaCon: Don’t F*** with… 1. Kids 2. Cops 3. Bar Staff 4. NYC 5. NYC Vax Requirements 6. Santa’s Charity Mission” Setting aside the suggestion implicit in the publication of such rules that SantaCon attendees are likely to interfere with any or all six of the above, the timid avoidance of using an actual expletive also indicates how far SantaCon has come from its anarchic roots. There will be no war waging against capitalism on Saturday. And unfortunately for many New Yorkers, it is the Santas who will be bad boys and girls this year.",News/US news,Bad SantaCon: how the event went from anti-capitalist protest to day of debauchery,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/09/santacon-new-york-debauchery-charity
12/10/2021,"Britons partial to a festive glass of port or sherry should nurse it carefully this Christmas as a shake-up of alcohol taxes threatens to add at least £1 to bottle prices next year. The chancellor announced a sweeping overhaul of alcohol duties in the budget, reducing the tax take on lower-strength drinks, such as draught beer, but increasing them on products, such as fortified wine, with an alcohol content above 11%.  Andrew Hawes, the managing director of the wine importer Mentzendorff, said port and sherry fans were about to be hit with the “largest single alcohol tax rise in UK history”. UK shoppers buy 10m bottles of sherry and close to 9m bottles of port each year. “Local wine merchants up and down the country are aghast at the suggested tax rises, which will see port and sherry brands such as Taylor’s and La Gitana take on the largest single alcohol tax rises in UK history,” said Hawes. “Ultimately I fear it will be the consumers who will pay the price, which is a shame especially as we’ve invested so much to attract a new following to the joys of these fortified wines, which to date have offered incredible value.” Steve Moody, the managing director of Fells, another importer, said it made “absolutely no sense” to target the fortified wine category as sherry and port were “enjoyed in moderation” by friends and families on special occasions. “If the proposals remain unchanged it will result in the retail price of a bottle of port increasing overnight by £1.09,” he said. “That’s an immediate increase of more than 13%.” The Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA) is concerned the higher prices will kill off the sales revival being enjoyed by fortified wine makers, who have won a new, younger after thanks to the emergence of Fino bars. Sherry has also become a popular ingredient in homemade lockdown cocktails with UK sales up 13% in 2020. Whilse some alcoholic beverages can be adapted to bring down their alcohol content or ABV, there are strict production rules for port and sherry that do not allow producers to tamper with strength. The WSTA is calling for the government to rethink the plan which is the subject of a consultation that runs until the end of January. Miles Beale, the WSTA’s chief executive, said that if you enjoyed a port or sherry at Christmas “make the most of it this year as it might be priced out of your Christmas shop in the future”. The government needed to make sure it wasn’t introducing a new system that “embeds unfairness between products”, he added.",News/Business,Port and sherry importers ‘aghast’ as tax shake-up will add over £1 to bottle price,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/10/port-and-sherry-importers-aghast-as-tax-shake-up-will-add-over-1-to-bottle-price
12/10/2021,"Hello, Warren Murray bringing you the first tidings of Friday.  Dozens of Tory backbenchers are threatening to rebel or abstain from the vote for “plan B” Covid restrictions because of their fury over the impact of the proposed rules and Boris Johnson’s handling of the Christmas party scandal. At least 30 Conservative MPs are expected to vote against regulations on masks, home working and vaccine passports, and many more are vowing to stay away from Tuesday’s vote – potentially leaving the prime minister relying on Labour support to win. Johnson is also accused of misleading his own ethics adviser, exposing the PM to a potential suspension from the House of Commons, over the source of funds for redecoration of his Downing Street flat. A Downing Street spokesperson has said “The prime minister has acted in accordance with the rules at all times. He has made any requisite declarations.” Recent reports have said that Jack Doyle, the then deputy director of communications, gave out awards to staff during the supposed No 10 party on 18 December and there was food, drinks and games. Doyle, now head of press for Downing Street, has been contacted for comment. An inquiry hastily called by Johnson into the matter has been expanded to examine other alleged events including another Downing Street party on 27 November last year – reportedly a leaving event at which Johnson spoke – and one at the Department for Education on 10 December. In a further blow for the prime minister, a Survation survey for the Daily Mirror has put Labour six percentage points ahead of the Conservatives, at 40% to 34%. A YouGov poll for the Times had Labour four points ahead on 37% to 33%. There is next week’s byelection in North Shropshire as well – the direct outcome of another Tory politician seeming to put himself above the rules. ‘Mushrooms under the beds’ – Checks on the private rented sector are in “chaos”, the chair of the Commons public accounts committee has said, with the health effects of squalid rental homes costing the NHS £340m a year. Nearly 600,000 private rented homes in England, about 13%, have been classed as a serious threat to health and safety by the National Audit Office (NAO) while nearly a quarter are “non-decent”. Krystalrose Shirley, 27, who rented with her three-year-old daughter in north London, said: “There was a period when I was afraid to turn on my light in my bedroom because I was afraid of the mould … There were mushrooms growing under mine and my daughter’s beds.” Evictions are nearing pre-pandemic levels – Generation Rent estimates that at current rates, 83 households will be evicted in England and Wales every working day. The government has delayed until next year a white paper that would end to no-fault evictions. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities has been contacted for comment. Smollett guilty over fake assault – A jury in Chicago has found the US actor Jussie Smollett guilty of faking a hate crime against himself to raise his celebrity profile. Many fellow stars initially rushed to support Smollett when claimed in January 2019 that he had been attacked by people that had shouted “This is Maga country,” a reference to Donald Trump’s trademark political slogan “Make American Great Again”. Smollett told police he had been assaulted on a darkened street by two masked men who put a noose around his neck and poured chemicals on him while yelling racist and homophobic slurs and expressing their support for Trump. A month later police arrested Smollett himself, accusing the actor of paying two brothers $3,500 to stage the assault in a ploy to get public sympathy and boost his profile. ‘Flow before you go’ – Covid slogan of the week goes to Wales where the government says people should take a lateral flow test before going out Christmas shopping or to a festive party. The first minister, Mark Drakeford, is also asking people to “flow before you go”, and to wear face coverings in pubs and restaurants except when they are eating or drinking. There will be no new restrictions in Wales when Drakeford announces the results of its regular three-weekly review on Friday. Many of the “plan B” measures that are looming for England, such as wearing masks in indoor public places, are already in force in Wales. ‘We’ll continue talking’ – Efforts in Vienna to revive the Iran nuclear deal have been hauled back from the brink of collapse after pressure on Tehran from Russia and China and clear warnings that the EU and the US were preparing to walk away. Joe Biden has still warned that the United States is preparing “additional measures” against Iran. The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has said the talks represented the last chance for Iran to come back into compliance. Israel has been preparing military strikes in the expectation that the talks will fail, which would leave the Iranian nuclear programme unconstrained by any major multilateral agreement. The Iranian chief negotiator, Ali Bagheri, said on Thursday: “I felt other parties have a more serious will to enter effective and result-oriented talks … We’ll continue talking.” Short trip – A German court has ruled that a man who slipped and broke his back while walking downstairs from his bed to his home office can claim on workplace accident insurance as he was technically commuting. The court noted that the employee usually started working in his home office “immediately without having breakfast beforehand”. Statutory accident insurance was only afforded to this “first” journey to work, suggesting that a trip on the way to get breakfast after already being in the home office could be rejected. In many countries, firms have a duty of care to their employees, regardless of where they work. A video showing Downing Street staffers joking about alleged lockdown breaches is only the latest scandal to rock Boris Johnson’s premiership, reports political correspondent Peter Walker. Next week, “plan B” Covid restrictions are due before parliament, in the days before the Tories attempt to defend their seat in North Shropshire from a newly hopeful Liberal Democrat challenge.

But many actors have been lauded for their method – so what has changed? After the loss of both openers, a partnership between Dawid Malan and England captain Joe Root managed to slow Australia’s charge towards victory on day three of the opening Ashes Test at the Gabba. Racing has been thrown into turmoil after the National Hunt jockey Robbie Dunne was banned from riding for 18 months, with three months suspended, for conducting a seven-month campaign of bullying and intimidation against his fellow rider Bryony Frost. Tensions between Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen have ratcheted up again before the Formula One season decider at this weekend’s Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. Leicester contributed embarrassingly to their own downfall against an under-strength Napoli side and, as a result of a 3-2 defeat, dropped out of the Europa League and into Europa Conference League. Meanwhile, Ange Postecoglou bemoaned the “ridiculous” fixture list as his Celtic side lost strikers Kyogo Furuhashi and Albian Ajeti to hamstring problems as they rounded off their Europa League campaign with a 3-2 victory over Real Betis. Unstoppable Barcelona barely stepped out of second gear as they humbled Arsenal to cruise into the quarter-finals of the Women’s Champions League. And weightlifting and boxing are the “two problem childs of the Olympic movement” and remain at risk of being removed from the 2028 LA Games programme, the International Olympic Committee president, Thomas Bach, has warned. Borrowers could be spared a rate increase for the time being after expectations of rise at next week’s Bank of England monetary policy committee have begun to cool in the face of the rapid spread of Omicron Covid variant. The policymakers had been nailed on to hike rates to dampen inflation but the likelihood that economic activity will cool because of new health restrictions has changed the outlook in the City. The pound dipped yesterday as a result and is currently buying $1.322 and €1.171. The FTSE100 is also under a Covid cloud and is set to open down 0.3%. The Guardian leads with the No 10 flat redecoration controversy – our front-page picture story is “Sienna Miller: tabloid ‘nearly ruined my life’”. The actor has said the Sun forced her to make decisions “about my own body that I have to live with every single day” after the newspaper found out she was in the early stages of pregnancy. Miller, who ultimately did not have the baby, has accepted a settlement from the Sun, which she believes illegally obtained her private medical information from a “blagger”. We have quoted the Mirror’s polling and the Times has done its own: the resulting story, “Poll blow for Tories as trust in Johnson falls”. It gives Labour a four-point lead. The i takes things even further: “Tory leader contenders circle a PM in peril” and goes to the extent of putting pictures on its front, of Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss. Even the Express is forced to concede “Boris under the cosh!” but tempers this with news that “Carrie gives birth to baby girl”. “Mum’s the word” says the Metro as the PM takes family time. The Telegraph gets in on the “Good news at last … a baby girl in Downing Street” though its lead is “Lord Geidt on brink of quitting over PM’s flat” in reference to the PM’s standards adviser. The Mirror packs plenty into its front-page furniture: “Downing Street flat scandal … Another day … another lie … after No 10 parties shame … it’s revealed PM DID know all about £112k refurb cash”. The Daily Mail’s headline is “Tories’ Plan B mutiny”. The Financial Times has “Treasury rebuffs business chiefs’ appeal for extra aid during curbs” – Boris Johnson’s misery is not far below the surface of that, with the second paragraph mentioning the “mounting rebellion” among MPs.
