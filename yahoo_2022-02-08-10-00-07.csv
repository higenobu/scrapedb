2/8/2022,"Crikey, don't try this at home! During the wild season four finale of Crikey! It's the Irwins, Steve Irwin's son Robert was nearly attacked by a 12-foot crocodile. After moving the reptile, Casper, into a new home at the family's Australia Zoo, the 18-year-old wanted to check how comfortable the croc was in his new enclosure. ""If he's coming out of the water,"" Robert, who jumped in with Casper as part of his test, explained, ""giving big strikes, that means he's going to be ready for the Crocoseum show."" After Robert and his colleague, who was tasked with keeping an eye on Casper's girlfriend Wendy, entered the enclosure, he held out some meat and began stomping his feet to let Casper —who Robert described as ""wild"" and ""very hard to see under the water""—know that it was time for the feeding. ""I've got no idea how he's going to react,"" Robert said in the episode. ""And honestly, that's quite terrifying."" Bindi Irwin and Chandler Powell: Romance Rewind If only he knew what would come next. After Casper emerged from the water, he began to chase Robert, causing him to drop the meat and yell, ""Bail! Bail! Bail!"" It's a horrifying moment you need to see to believe. As for Robert, he's just happy he made it out in one piece. ""We've definitely saved the best for last, including one of the most intense croc feeds I've done!"" he wrote on Instagram ahead of the Feb. 5 finale, later adding, ""By getting in their enclosures with them, and letting them put on those huge strikes from the water's edge, they get to use all of their predatory instincts and they just love it! Plus we can educate everyone about their conservation. But safety for us is also crucial and you definitely have to know when to call it. And with such a powerful and quick croc like Casper we had no choice but to bail!""",U.S./E!

2/8/2022,"Former “Hercules” star Kevin Sorbo attempted to troll those danged libs on Monday with a tweet about COVID-19 vaccines, but it backfired badly. That’s because many people with the opposite of Sorbo’s politics actually agreed with his tweet ― even though it wasn’t the point he was trying to make. It all started when the ’90s-era TV star and outspoken conservative asked rhetorically why the COVID-19 vaccines have been free when other medical necessities cost money. It seems like Sorbo was trying to express skepticism about whether vaccines save lives (which they do). However, his tweet actually ended up illustrating a different argument, which many Twitter users noted. (Without checking, it seems likely that Clickhole’s famous article “Heartbreaking: The Worst Person You Know Just Made A Great Point” got linked somewhere in the replies.) HuffPost reached out to Sorbo for a comment about the reactions to his tweet, but did not immediately receive a response.

2/8/2022,"A 22-year-old Asian man in California is voicing his frustration after a gas station cashier told him to “go back to China,” leading a police officer to purportedly blame him for escalating their encounter.

The incident, which was partly caught on video, allegedly occurred at the Arco gas station at 631 North Garfield Ave. in Monterey Park around 5 p.m. on Jan. 28.

The man, who asked to not be identified, told NextShark, “I just came in and asked for gas, then the cashier started to yell, ‘Go back to China,’ and denied me service,” he claimed.

The man filmed parts of the incident and shared them with NextShark. In the video, the cashier confirms the man’s allegation that she told him to “go back to China.”

 

Shortly after, the cashier takes out her own phone and appears to film the incident from her end.

While the man can be heard repeating his claims to a bystander, the cashier alleges, “He keep fighting [sic] with me,” and “He don’t [sic] leave.”

The encounter ends with the man leaving the station and the cashier raising her middle finger.

After the incident, the man said he contacted Monterey Park Police Department, which then referred the case to a detective. He said he called to ask for a report, but no one has sent him any update yet.

The man said the department also sent a deputy to speak with him about the incident at the gas station. He managed to film parts of a conversation he says only made him feel worse.

“What she did was totally wrong and unacceptable. Is that what you need to hear to feel better?” the officer asked in the video.

The man said he was surprised to hear the officer’s response, but the latter went on to speculate that it was potentially the young man’s fault.

“Maybe [it’s] the way you asked her… She’s already in a bad mood. The way you asked her ‘I want to add gas,’ maybe if you had said, ‘Can I have some gas on such and such, please?’ I don’t know,” the officer said. The man insisted to NextShark that he had asked for the gas politely.

“The police first said it didn’t seem racist to him, but when I took out my phone to record, he changed and said he will take the report,” he added.

The man said he also contacted Arco’s customer service on Jan. 31. He said a representative told him that “the owner” will contact him back, but he still has not received a call.

NextShark has reached out to Monterey Park police and Arco for comment. This is a developing story.

2/8/2022,"Brian Kilmeade of Fox News blasted Donald Trump over his 2020 election claims Monday. Kilmeade, speaking on his talk-radio show, said that the former president lied about Arizona’s election audit. Taking a call from a listener named Logan, who said he was a Trump supported, the host agreed that he was concerned about Trump’s various claims of the election. Despite Joe Biden winning Arizona in 2020, Trump maintained that the audit showed otherwise. Kilmeade said he believes people would rather focus on other current events. “Right now, nobody cares about 2020,” he said. “Nobody. And everything that he said and the challenges that he made should’ve been done before the election. And they did a recount in Arizona, and the recount showed no difference almost, and he came out and said it showed that they won Arizona. That’s an outright lie, and please stop wasting our time with that, because he’s capable of doing so much more.” “Nobody cares about your topics. There is so much to talk about that matters to you and I, Logan, right now about what’s happening in the Ukraine, how China is just forgetting about phase one, how they’re beginning to militarize everything around them, about to take Taiwan back. What’s happening here in this country… That’s what people wanna talk about. It’s not hard stuff.”",Politics/The Wrap,Fox News’ Brian Kilmeade Slams Trump Over ‘Outright Lie’ About 2020 Election,https://news.yahoo.com/fox-news-brian-kilmeade-slams-002858624.html
2/8/2022,"OAKLAND, Calif. — Gov. Gavin Newsom is poised to ease statewide restrictions on mass gatherings and indoor masking as the Omicron coronavirus variant continues to recede. The plan, confirmed by an administration official, would be the first step in Newsom's exit strategy for the Covid-19 pandemic — a major shift for a state that has preserved some of the nation’s strictest and longest-lasting restrictions. Officials said the state would unveil more details next week. Lifting Omicron-era crowd-size restrictions on indoor and outdoor gatherings and letting the state's indoor mask mandate expire on Feb. 15 after the Super Bowl are just the beginning of Newsom's path out of the pandemic. The shift comes amid improving case numbers and growing calls for a blueprint to normal — and after wide-angle photographs at an NFL playoff game in Los Angeles showed Newsom and scores of fans maskless in the stands, despite masking rules for large events. Administration officials said future steps would likely include updated mask policies for Californians writ large and potentially even schoolchildren, who have been under a strict mask requirement throughout the pandemic. Newsom signaled last month that he would introduce a strategy for the “endemic” — a time when overall rates have stabilized, but the disease will still have to be managed — promising Californians that there was a light at the end of the tunnel as Omicron cases plummeted. It comes amid mounting pressure from California residents and businesses for a blueprint to normal. Still, despite the behind-the-scenes and incremental work, officials have conveyed little of their vision to the public. Instead the Legislature has been signaling its own intention to ramp up pandemic policies — with talk still circulating about a statewide vaccine mandate for going about daily business. Business advocates have been pushing the administration to move faster to restore normality. “There is a huge and growing frustration in the business community about the need to have a clear and flexible and certain endemic policy,” said Rob Lapsley, president of California Business Roundtable. And school administrators, as the Omicron surge subsides, also want to know where they’re headed. Troy Flint, a spokesperson for the California School Boards Association, said some districts have started to ask for targets that would trigger a “relaxation of some of the rules around masking, testing, independent study and other Covid-19 mitigation measures.” He said while the desire isn’t “universal,” it’s certainly not limited to conservative or rural school districts. More heavily Democratic areas of the state have also been working on exit strategies, as restaurants, businesses and schools are reporting more angst about mask requirements. Contra Costa County in the Bay Area on Friday rescinded its order requiring customers to show proof of vaccination or a negative test result before entering certain businesses including restaurants, bars and gyms. Jeanne Noble, the director of Covid-19 response for the University of California, San Francisco hospital’s emergency department, has been in talks with the state Department of Public Health about taking a stronger stance on steering the state out of pandemic emergency mode. She helped launch a California-focused Change.Org petition to that effect that’s gathered nearly 40,000 signatures and will head shortly to Newsom’s top health officials. “CDPH needs to show that it is anticipating the way things are going and modify its policies to keep up with the real day to day threat of COVID and — when it recedes, to let our most vulnerable people who suffer the most typically from these restrictions, to give them a break, even if we need to bring the restrictions back in the future,” Noble said. She said she believes the immediate flood of support for the petition “gives more urgency to the matter that we really need to get ahead of the trends.” Wherever the state moves in terms of relaxing things, businesses may still have to keep grappling with a double set of stricter standards for their workers, which Cal/OSHA reupped last month. Under those rules, unvaccinated workers must always be masked when they’re inside, and each employee has to wear a face covering in a business-provided car or transport and during indoor health screenings. These requirements from Jan. 14 were superseded by the health agency’s Omicron orders, so haven’t yet gone into effect. But they would kick in if and when the CDPH drops its mask requirements for employees. Workplace safety officials could revise their rules to conform in the wake of the new endemic plan, even though Cal/OSHA has already twice amended its temporary regulations — the maximum amount that state law permits during an emergency period. Newsom, however, signed an executive order in December allowing for a third revision of the rules. Alexander Nieves contributed to this story.

2/8/2022,"By Anna Mehler Paperny, David Ljunggren and Ismail Shakil OTTAWA (Reuters) -Police in Canada's national capital have seized thousands of liters of fuel and removed an oil tanker as part of a crackdown to end days long protest against the government's health measures, police said on Monday. Honking has disrupted the normally quiet life of the residents https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/ottawans-fed-up-with-trucker-blockade-blame-police-inaction-2022-02-03 in downtown Ottawa and a judge granted an interim injunction against the noise on Monday. A ""Freedom Convoy"" has disrupted life in downtown Ottawa for 11 days now. What started as a movement opposing a Canadian vaccine mandate for cross-border drivers - a requirement mirrored by a U.S. rule - has morphed into a rallying point against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and many Canadian governments' public health measures. ""We are turning up the heat in every way we possibly can,"" Ottawa Police Chief Peter Sloly told reporters, days after he said there may not be a ""policing solution"" to the occupation. ""We are asking for a major push of resources to come in the next 72 hours."" While Ottawa awoke to its second week of what its political and policing leaders now describe as a siege, Sloly said on Monday activity has decreased at the blockades. This weekend, police counted 1,000 trucks and 5,000 protesters, down from 3,000 trucks and 10,000 to 15,000 protesters last weekend, Sloly added. 'PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE' Deputy Police Chief Steve Bell told city councillors Monday that police had received ""active threats to public figures throughout this occupation,"" which they continue to investigate. Ottawa police have received help from hundreds of officers in other police agencies, but they say it is not enough. Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson asked for reinforcements in a letter Monday to Trudeau and Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino. ""The occupation has turned into an aggressive and hateful occupation of our neighbourhoods,"" he wrote. ""People are living in fear and are terrified."" He called the honking ""tantamount to psychological warfare."" The protests, which last week included some Confederate and Nazi flags, have been largely peaceful. A Canadian judge on Monday granted an interim injunction preventing people from sounding horns in downtown Ottawa. The 10-day injunction is part of a class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of downtown Ottawa residents, some of whom have said they feel unsafe in their own neighbourhood. A short stretch of Metcalfe Street in downtown Ottawa, home to Canada's parliament, central bank, and buildings including Trudeau's office, smelled of campfire on Monday. A clustering of trucks, cars and tractors without trailers bore signs deriding everything from vaccines and mandates to Canada's carbon tax. One sign showed a poster of Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which guarantees rights including that of life, liberty and security of the person - subject to ""reasonable limits."" 'PRIME MINISTER STOP HIDING' Packets of water bottles, briquettes and diapers were piled high beside open-sided white tents with tables of food. There was also evidence of pushback from residents. Small signs in the ground-floor windows of an apartment building a few blocks away said: ""GO HOME MORONS"" and ""VACCINES SAVE LIVES."" ""We cannot allow an angry crowd to reverse the course that continues to save lives in this last stretch. This should never be a precedent for how to make policy in Canada,"" Mendicino told reporters on Monday. Trudeau, who is isolating after testing positive for COVID-19, did not attend the press conference and missed question period in the parliament. Trudeau and his family left their downtown home after truckers started arriving in Ottawa and his location has not been disclosed due to security concerns. ""When will the prime minister stop hiding, show up for Canadians, show some leadership and fix the mess that he's created?"" interim Conservative Party leader Candice Bergen, who has supported the protests, told the House of Commons. On Sunday night, police began removing gas and fuel supplies at a logistics encampment set up by protesters after the city's mayor declared a state of emergency https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/protest-against-vaccine-mandates-paralyzing-canada-capital-mayor-says-2022-02-06 on Sunday. A well-organized supply chain -- including portable saunas, a community kitchen and bouncy castles for children -- has sustained the protesters. It has relied partly on funding from sympathizers in the United States, police said. Former U.S. President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk have praised the truckers. Over the weekend, protests spilled over into other large Canadian cities, including the financial capital Toronto, and were met with counter demonstrations. Canadians have largely followed government's health measures and nearly 79% of the eligible population has taken two doses of the vaccine. But recent polls have shown frustrations against restrictions are growing.
