4/4/2022,"The German government is facing growing pressure at home and abroad to introduce an energy embargo against Russia as reports of atrocities committed on Ukrainian civilians in Bucha increased the urgency of calls for action. Berlin has so far pushed back on calls for an outright ban on energy imports from Russia, warning that the consequences for Europe’s largest economy and the entire European Union would be devastating. However, discussions are widespread about reducing industry production times to save energy, while ordinary Germans are being urged to turn down thermostats and drive more slowly. A spokesperson for the German government said it would not be considering an immediate embargo but that it was determined to speed up its efforts to wean Germany off Russian gas and oil. “An immediate embargo with a halt to gas deliveries would damage the German economy considerably more than it would Putin’s economy,” said Oliver Krischer, from the ministry for the economy and climate protection, on Monday morning. “After these pictures of the weekend, we will once again see how we can more quickly, and by using further measures, reduce our dependence,” he said. Efforts were being made to introduce a “quasi-embargo” he said, through “non-purchase” and “energy-saving measures” as well as “diversification”, including buying liquefied petroleum gas. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said the atrocities – in which hundreds of civilians are believed to have been murdered north of Kiev – would not go unanswered, calling them war crimes, and promised on Sunday night that Germany, together with its partners, would be increasing sanctions against Russia in the coming days. The defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, later went further, saying that it was time for the European Union to jointly discuss the option of a complete ban on Russian gas. “There must be a response,” she said in a television interview. “Such crimes cannot remain unanswered.” Opinion polls have shown that the majority of Germans – between 55% and 77% – are in favour of stopping imports of gas from Russia, despite the impact it might have on their ability to heat their own homes. The majority said they were also in favour of temporarily increasing the lifespan of coal-fired plants and of making nuclear power plants – the phase-out of which began following the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan in 2011 – operational again. As a whole, Europe gets about 40% of its gas supplies from Russia. In Germany, the figure is 55%, the highest dependency of any European state. Pressure from Germany’s neighbours has been growing, particularly the Baltic states and Poland. Mateusz Morawiecki, the prime minister of Poland, on Monday accused Germany of “standing in the way” of harder sanctions against Russia. “Anyone who reads the notes of EU meetings knows that Germany is the biggest impediment when it comes to more decisive sanctions,” he told journalists in Warsaw. On Sunday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused the former German chancellor Angela Merkel and the former French president Nicolas Sarkozy of contributing to Russian aggression by making too many concessions towards Putin. “I invite Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy to visit Bucha and to see for their own eyes where the politics of making concessions to Russia in over 14 years has led. You will see tortured Ukrainian men and women with your own eyes,” he said in his nightly video address to Ukrainians. In particular, he levelled criticism at Merkel for not backing Ukraine’s attempts to join Nato in 2008. Merkel’s office responded unusually swiftly to the criticism. In a statement, a spokesperson said: “The retired German chancellor Dr Angela Merkel stands by her decision in conjunction with the Nato summit in Bucharest in 2008.” The spokesperson added that Merkel supported every effort of the German government to stop Russia’s invasion, especially in light of the “atrocities of Bucha and other parts of Ukraine”. Germany’s economics minister, Robert Habeck, who as a leading Green has pushed for years for the abolition of coal-fired plants and the scrapping of nuclear power plants, said Germany was working on reducing its reliance on Russian energy but that it could not happen overnight. “We are working every single day to create the preconditions and to pave the way towards an embargo,” he said when asked if news of the murder of civilians in Bucha would lead to a government rethink. “This is also, in the view of the federal government, as well as in my own opinion, the way forward and one which harms Putin on a daily basis.”",News/World news,Pressure mounts on German ministers to embargo Russian energy,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/04/pressure-mounts-germany-embargo-russian-energy-imports
4/4/2022,"Over 35 years as a pivotal figure in EastEnders, June Brown achieved two significant firsts in British soap opera. Dorothy “Dot” Cotton (later Branning), scripture-quoting chain-smoking mum of a killer, was the first BBC soap star to match the impact of the monstrous but compelling women, such as Ena Sharples and Hilda Ogden, in ITV’s Coronation Street, which met in EastEnders its first real ratings rival. On 9 February 2020, the 35th anniversary of EastEnders’ launch, in a Sun newspaper poll on the popularity of the soap’s characters, Dot Cotton achieved 86% approval ratings – the highest of anyone tested. Brown’s contribution to the show – and status as one of its most accomplished performers – had already been internally recognised in Episode 3518, screened on 31 January 2008. The script was subtitled Poor Baby, but has become known as Dot’s Monologue. It was a 29-minute soliloquy, the first and, to date, only single-character episode of a UK soap ever. It would have been too steep a breach of soap realism for Dot to acknowledge the presence of the camera or audience. So the script by Tony Jordan used the conceit of Dot recording a message for her second husband, Jim Branning, to be played to him in hospital as he lay comatose after a stroke. Jordan combined this idea of a prompt tape with the literary model of Samuel Beckett’s play Krapp’s Last Tape, in which an old man leaves a reel-to-reel diary for posterity. Dot’s ecstatic memories of young love, refracted through her depression, were consciously Beckettian, as was the bleak ending in which she concludes that, if her husband recovers, he will have to go to a home as she can no longer care for him. Jordan, and the show’s then-producer John Yorke, conceived the idea partly in recognition of Brown being the most classically trained and technically gifted actor in the regular cast, but also to keep her interested in a character she had by then been playing for almost two decades. (Brown had taken a sabbatical, from 1993-97, to explore other work.) Punctuating the memoir-confession with stubbing out of fags from yet another pack of Final Draw (BBC anti-advertising rules mean that Walford residents have to smoke fictional brands), Brown justified the creative team’s gamble. Herself twice widowed, she combined an emotionally authentic depiction of grief and love with the pacing and phrasing skills of someone who had once played Shakespeare and Ibsen leads on stage. The episode, for which Brown won a Bafta TV nomination (only the second soap performer to do so, after Jean Alexander, for her Hilda Ogden), established her at the heart of the show, where she remained, Brown’s workload reducing only due to deteriorating eyesight, until she retired at around the time of the soap’s 30th anniversary. Although born in 1927, before British television existed, Brown belonged to the second generation of great British soap opera women. Violet Carson and Margot Bryant, born in the last years of the 19th century, had created the genre’s matri-archetypes, the moralistic tittle-tattles Ena Sharples and Minnie Caldwell, in Coronation Street, featuring in its first scene in 1960. Brown herself appeared in what was then the UK’s predominant soap, for three episodes in 1970-71, as a minor Salford woman called Mrs Parsons. Her other TV roles before EastEnders, though, had been generically varied, including five appearances in episodes of Play For Today, of which the most noted was Edna the Inebriate Woman, a drama about alcoholism, written by Cathy Come Home screenwriter Jeremy Sandford, which was watched by 29 million viewers in 1971. Few people in any field, outside of royal families, take on a life-defining role when they’re approaching 60, but that is what happened to Brown in 1985, when Michael Grade, then running BBC One, decided the channel needed to attract the vast early evening soap opera audience that ITV monopolised with Coronation Street, Crossroads and Emmerdale Farm (now known as Emmerdale). Charged with finding a BBC answer to Corrie, creators Julia Smith and Tony Holland carefully studied the template for the fictional north-west town of Wetherfield by the ITV show’s architect, Tony Warren, who had made Coronation Street British TV’s first female-led drama. When Smith and Warren went to the Canary Islands in March 1984 to write a ‘Bible’ of the main characters for a show that had the working title East 8, they did not include Dot. But in a later stage of planning, reflecting on the vital female spine of Corrie, they added three more, including a supportive mum for young villain Nick Cotton. The genesis sketch identified Mrs Cotton as a religious, hypochondriacal, gossipy chain-smoker, with a job in Walford laundrette. As a Christian with a concept of sin that conveniently excluded scandal-mongering, drinking and smoking, Dot was recognisably a latter-day sister of Corrie’s Ena Sharples. Brown was recommended for the part by Leslie Grantham, already cast as “Dirty” Den Watts, who had seen Brown convincingly play working-class roles on stage and screen. Dot was not in the first cast photo released by the BBC to publicise the launch, first appearing in the 40th episode, in July 1985, as part of Nick’s back-story. Her character, unlike some in later decades of EastEnders, was an authentic East End type – a feature of criminal trials at the time was the loyal mum who, clutching her Holy Bible as her son was sent down, refused to accept his guilt. Dot was habitually mournful, the lips that invariably held a lit cigarette almost always turned downward; this utterly miserable visage became a signature that was gleefully guyed by impressionists. Her attitude was, though, narratively justified by storylines in which first husband Charlie committed bigamy with Dot’s sister, while Nick was exposed as a murderer, accidentally killed Dot’s grandson and plotted to poison Dot. A combination of a Suffolk upbringing, wartime evacuation to Wales and London drama training at a time when regional accents were schooled out helped Brown to create Dot’s distinctive voice, in which an East London grounding (the character was born in Walford) is mixed with the intermittent posh notes of someone who considers herself a cut above the locals, and has often chatted with vicars at the church door, plus some stray pronunciations picked up on her travels. (Jordan gave Dot, like Brown, a childhood Welsh spell during the Second World War.) Although sometimes feeling the resentment of any talented actor who becomes overwhelmingly known for one role, Brown understandably came to enjoy a prominence, salary and security of employment that are available to few in their seventh to tenth decades. Interviewed by Radio Times in 2019, Brown insisted she would continue with her seven-decade smoking habit, and go on drinking her preferred tipples of Guinness and wine, as she had reached an age when tips on living longer were of little interest to her. Unlike some nonagenarians, though, she kept up with popular culture, citing Lady Gaga as a role-model of reinvention. For the last eight years of Brown’s time on EastEnders, from 2012, her character’s name was doing double duty in BBC primetime. DI Matthew Cottan, a key figure in Jed Mercurio’s police drama Line of Duty, was nicknamed “Dot”. This was a realistic reflection of the way nicknames and banter draw on popular TV, but the in-joke was only possible because of the instant and affectionate mass public recognition of the great soap character June Brown created.",Arts/Television & radio,June Brown: the genius chain-smoking queen of the East End,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/04/june-brown-dot-cotton-the-genius-chain-smoking-queen-of-the-east-end-eastenders
4/4/2022,"The Derby d’Italia was only 34 minutes old, but already we had seen blood, sweat and tears – and that was just Manuel Locatelli. The game had barely begun when Lautaro Martínez’s high boot caught the Juventus midfielder in the face, opening a gash above his left eye. Locatelli soldiered on, only to injure his knee while raising his own studs into a challenge on Danilo D’Ambrosio. Some journalists speculated that he might have ruptured his cruciate ligament as they saw him hobble to the sideline weeping. Perhaps Locatelli is just a man willing to share his emotions. He cried on the pitch after scoring his first goal for Milan at 18 years old, too, as well as after winning Euro 2020 with Italy. Massimiliano Allegri suggested later that the injury was not too serious, and that Locatelli should be back in “20 days or so”. The player’s anguish likely had less to do with physical pain than frustration at being forced out of a game that had the potential to change the course of this Serie A season. Both teams’ title ambitions hung in the balance. Juventus had battled back into the Scudetto conversation with a run of 16 league games undefeated. Internazionale were at risk of slipping out of it after winning only once in six earlier in the year. A 12-point gap between the two sides at the start of this year had been whittled down to just one, with Milan and Napoli becoming frontrunners in the meantime. Allegri insisted at his pre-game press conference that Juventus’s focus was only on consolidating their place in the top four, but a loss for fifth-placed Atalanta earlier on Sunday afternoon eased the pressure. For an evening, at least, his team could afford to raise their sights instead of looking over their shoulders. Perhaps that knowledge informed his players’ approach in a fiery first portion of the match, in which they pressed and attacked with a tempo we have not seen often from them. Allegri opted for an attacking 4-2-3-1, with Paulo Dybala, Álvaro Morata and Juan Cuadrado supporting Dusan Vlahovic. Locatelli was not the only one throwing himself into challenges. Vlahovic drew a save inside the first minute. Giorgio Chiellini hit the bar in the ninth. Any clean connection would have been enough to force the ball over the line after the Inter goalkeeper Samir Handanovic punched Cuadrado’s cross straight up into the air but the Juventus defender – who should have been penalised for pushing to gain position as it came back down – could only graze it. Further chances came and went, for Dybala, Morata and Dybala again. Handanovic was rescued from another potentially catastrophic mistake when he pushed a shot from Cuadrado out toward the penalty spot before a heavy deflection off Milan Skriniar took the ball away from danger. Inter had barely crossed halfway but in the 45th minute they won a penalty. Denzel Dumfries was moving away from goal on the right side of the area when he went down between Morata and Alex Sandro, but replays showed Sandro had trod on his boot. The VAR booth intervened after the referee, Massimiliano Irrati, had initially waved to play on. Hakan Calhanoglu’s spot-kick, fired low to the keeper’s right, was saved by Wojciech Szczesny. The drama was just getting started. Calhanoglu chased the rebound, and seconds later the ball wound up in the net. But Irrati signalled a free-kick against the Inter player. Replay analysis would later suggest Calhanoglu had kicked the heel of Danilo. Once again, VAR came to Inter’s rescue. Matthijs De Ligt had encroached into the area before the penalty was taken. Calhanoglu, with impressive steel, took this as an opportunity to repeat his original penalty but better – shooting in the exact same direction but this time with more power and conviction. Szczesny went the right way but could not get there. Amid it all, fury and frustration boiled over, players and Allegri launching his jacket into orbit. By the time Irrati finally blew his whistle for half-time, the game had been going for almost 55 minutes. A further 45 still were not enough for Juventus. They dominated possession and the pitch even more effectively in the second half, yet had fewer scoring opportunities. Vlahovic, marshalled superbly by Skriniar for most of the evening, wriggled free with one sharp turn on the edge of the box but shot wide. Locatelli’s replacement, Denis Zakaria, created the only real moment of jeopardy when he hit the post at the end of a weaving run. Juventus were unfortunate not to win a penalty when Alessandro Bastoni fouled Zakaria on the edge of the area – Irrati ruled that the challenge had taken place outside the box but frame-by-frame analysis suggested contact took place on the line. This time there was no VAR intervention. Juventus’s Adrien Rabiot showed his frustration when he posted on Instagram later that “it’s difficult to play on 11 against 12”. In truth, with another referee, this game might easily have been 10 against 10. Rabiot put in one of his better performances in a Juventus shirt overall but trod a fine line with one or two challenges after a 15th-minute yellow card. Martínez could easily have received two bookings in the first half. Irrati was erratic, and VAR inscrutable as ever. Would it even be a Derby d’Italia without refereeing controversy? Piero Ceccarini’s failure to whistle a foul against Mark Iuliano on Ronaldo in 1998 remains one of the most bitter memories in Inter’s history, but this is a fixture that even put the lauded Pierluigi Collina in a spin the year before, when he awarded Maurizio Ganz a goal for Inter and then took it away for an unflagged offside more than a minute later. Allegri preferred to focus on the positives for his team on Sunday, expressing pleasure at their performance and saying he believed the foundations were in place to challenge for the title next year. The Bianconeri have been running just to keep up ever since they opened this campaign with two losses and two draws. Yet the greatest satisfaction could only belong to Simone Inzaghi, leading Inter to a first away win against Juventus since 2012. This after drawing the league meeting at San Siro and defeating them in extra time to lift the Supercoppa in January. Atalanta 1-3 Napoli, Fiorentina 1-0 Empoli, Juventus 0-1 Internazionale, Lazio 2-1 Sassuolo, Salernitana 0-1 Torino, Sampdoria 0-1 Roma, Spezia 1-0 Venezia, Udinese 5-1 Cagliari Monday Verona v Genoa (5.30pm BST), Milan v Bologna (7.45pm BST) “We are further ahead than I expected to be when it comes to results and trophies,” insisted Inzaghi, quietly reminding us that pre-season expectations were not sky-high for a team who sold two of their most influential players – Romelu Lukaku and Achraf Hakimi – as well as changing manager after winning the title last spring. Inzaghi said Inter had already asked him to extend his two-year contract but that he had been the one to push on the brakes, wanting to wait and see where results took them. The win on Sunday took them back to within three points of Milan and Napoli – holding a game in hand on the latter team but not the former, who host Bologna on Monday night. With seven rounds left to go, there is time yet for plenty more blood, sweat and tears. And no doubt for more frustration at VAR’s inconsistent interventions.",Sport/Football,Officials frustrate Juventus as Inter keep title defence ambitions on track | Nicky Bandini,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/04/officials-frustrate-juventus-internazionale-keep-serie-a-title-defence-ambitions-on-track
4/4/2022,"Roman Abramovich’s $600m (£458m) superyacht Solaris has left a port in Turkey after the London-based company that operates the terminal which had been harbouring the oligarch’s yacht was pressed to act. Solaris, which is 140 metres long and has a helipad and swimming pool, left Bodrum Cruise Port on Monday. It is now at anchor off Yalikavak beach in south-eastern Turkey, according to the shipping data service Marine Traffic. Pressure had been building for Global Ports Holding (GPH), the Mayfair-headquartered company that runs Bodrum Cruise Port, to refuse services to Solaris. Legal experts had said the London-listed company was taking “a very big risk” by allowing a superyacht owned by a sanctioned individual to use one of its ports. The Bodrum port is one of 22 terminals run by the firm. Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea Football Club, is one of several Russian billionaires hit by UK sanctions last month as part of the government’s efforts to put pressure on Vladimir Putin to end the invasion of Ukraine. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, described the sanctioned individuals as having “the blood of the Ukrainian people on their hands”. A spokesperson for Global Ports Holding declined to comment on why Solaris had left the port. In a statement on Sunday, the company said it did not have “any power to accept or reject any ship or yacht” from the port but it had taken the decision to “not receive any service fee or other payments concerning the berthing of this superyacht”. “Global Ports Holding plc notes recent press speculation regarding the berthing at Bodrum Yolcu Liman İşletmeleri AŞ (Bodrum Cruise Port), Turkey, of a superyacht, allegedly owned by a designated person subject to sanctions imposed by the UK government,” GPH said. “As a private terminal operator in Turkey, GPH merely operates Bodrum Cruise Port as the concessionaire and is not involved in granting permission for a ship or a yacht to dock at the port. This responsibility and decision sit with the Turkish authorities, and as concessionaire, GPH must comply with such a decision as long as the decision is legal under the applicable laws. “However, and notwithstanding the difficulties of any party to correctly identify the actual ownership of such assets, GPH has not and will not receive any service fee or other payments concerning the berthing of this superyacht at Bodrum Cruise Port.” The company said the berthing of Solaris did not breach UK sanction laws because “the alleged offence has taken place at a port outside the United Kingdom where GPH does not have any ownership or any power to accept or reject any ship or yacht pursuant to the applicable laws”. Solaris arrived at Bodrum Cruise Port on 22 March after hurriedly leaving a port in Barcelona, where it was undergoing repairs, as EU countries began seizing sanctioned individuals’ assets. Ukrainian protesters tried to stop Solaris mooring at the port. Members of the Optimist Sailing Team Ukraine confronted the vessel in a small boat, chanting “No war in Ukraine” and waving the country’s flag. They were part of a junior sailing team that was in Turkey to compete in an annual competition, having left Ukraine before the invasion. Turkey has refused to impose sanctions on Russians, despite the UK, US and EU uniting to restrict oligarchs believed to have benefited from close relationships with Putin. The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, said the oligarchs were “of course” welcome and could do business in Turkey according to international law. Another, even larger, superyacht owned by Abramovich is moored in Turkey. Eclipse, which at 162.5 metres is believed to be the world’s second largest superyacht, arrived at the port of Marmaris on 22 March. Reports suggest that Abramovich owns as many as five superyachts worth more than $1bn (£762m) in total. Another yacht linked to the billionaire, Garcon, is now berthed in Antigua. The Antiguan government has asked for the UK’s assistance to seize the vessel. Ronald Sanders, the country’s ambassador to the US, told Reuters: “We’ve said that we’re quite happy to cooperate, but under the rule of law. The only way we can [seize the vessel] is if the British, in their mutual legal assistance treaty request, establish that this is a person they want because he has committed some crime.”",News/World news,Roman Abramovich’s superyacht leaves Turkish port run by UK-listed firm,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/04/roman-abramovich-superyacht-leaves-turkish-port-run-by-uk-listed-firm
4/4/2022,"The most famous and popular horse races in Britain and the United States do not, at first glance, have a great deal in common. The Grand National is a four-and-a-quarter mile handicap steeplechase on turf, for instance, while the Kentucky Derby is a Grade One 10-furlong Flat race for three-year-olds on dirt, to highlight just a few of the many differences between the two. But a fascinating column by Gary West for the US TVG network’s website a few days ago is a reminder that, like most of the truly historic sporting events, both the Kentucky Derby and the Grand National continue to change and evolve. West argues – persuasively - that the introduction of a points system to qualify for the Run for the Roses has had a profound effect on how the race is run. The sprint-bred speedballs that once ensured a breakneck pace from the off, teeing it up for the closers, no longer make it into the starting gate. That, in turn, has made the 20-runner race one that punters can approach with a little more confidence. Six of the last nine Kentucky Derby favourites have won – the same number as in the previous 33. Continuing evolution is normal and natural, even for storied events which date back to the 19th century. In fact, it is what helps to keep them compelling and relevant, from one generation to the next, and the Grand National is no different. The most recent significant changes at Aintree arrived, like those at Louisville, around a decade ago, when the cores of the famous National fences were softened and there was a further levelling of the drop at Becher’s Brook. Aintree’s most famous obstacle had previously undergone significant alteration after two fatal falls in the 1989 Grand National, and when compared to the great race even 20 years ago, when Bindaree and Jim Culloty beat What’s Up Boys by just under two lengths, the 2022 Grand National this weekend will be a very different beast. Like the Kentucky Derby in a few weeks’ time, the National will look much the same as it ever did, to the once-a-year punters at least. Forty runners are expected to go to post, there will be 30 fences to jump and the nine minutes’ or so of action will fly by in what seems more like 90 seconds. When Bindaree won in 2002, though, there were also 40 runners, but just six were trained in Ireland. This year, Ireland is likely to field a majority of the field for the first time. Bindaree also won off an official rating of 136, over four-and-a-half miles. This year, a mark of around 145 will be required simply to get into the field, while the trip is now four miles, two-and-a-half furlongs. Two decades on from Bindaree’s National, our most famous race has improved steadily with age, and from this observer’s viewpoint at least, there is definitely something missing from the build-up as a result. It is the nagging sense of dread behind the excitement and anticipation, a feeling that grew from one year to the next in the early part of the century as scarcely a single Grand National unfolded without at least one runner suffering a fatal injury.

After the course was modified, there were no fatal injuries in the six years from 2013 to 2018, and while a horse has died in the last two runnings – 2020, of course, having been abandoned – neither was injured by a fall (The Long Mile broke down between fences while Up For Review, in 2019, was brought down at the first). No horse race will ever be risk-free, and jumping obstacles will always bring additional risks. But the National – the one race all year that persuades the British public to sit up and take notice – is no longer an outlier, with an injury rate significantly higher than the rest of the National Hunt programme. It showcases the best of our sport and not the worst, and long may it continue to do so.",Sport/Sport,Talking Horses: the Grand National is much safer and all the better for it,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/04/talking-horses-the-grand-national-is-much-safer-and-all-the-better-for-it-horse-racing
4/4/2022,"The JP Morgan chief executive, Jamie Dimon, has warned that the US bank could lose up to $1bn (£763m) from its exposure to Russia, as he called on the US government to deploy more troops, restructure supply chains and launch a new “Marshall plan” to ensure energy supply in response to the war in Ukraine. In his widely read annual letter to investors, Dimon urged Joe Biden’s administration to take a stronger stance against the “grave new geopolitical realities” emerging after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, saying it was up to democratic nations to take a stand “against all forms of evil”. Dimon, who is one of the most high-profile bosses to comment on the conflict so far, also detailed the bank’s potential $1bn losses because of its direct exposure to Russia. JP Morgan announced it was winding down its Russia operations – which employ about 160 staff – last month. “As I write this letter, the war in Ukraine has been raging for well over a month and is creating a significant refugee crisis. We do not know what its outcome ultimately will be, but the hostilities in Ukraine and the sanctions on Russia are already having a substantial economic impact. They have roiled global oil, commodity and agricultural markets,” he said. However, Dimon said the war’s wider impact, including the “potential restructuring of the global order – is far more important”. Noting that the war could impact geopolitics for decades, he added: “We must confront the Russia challenge with bold solutions.” Dimon urged the US to develop a Marshall plan that would reduce the west’s reliance on Russian fossil fuels – referring to Harry Truman’s 1948 aid programme that helped western Europe recover from the second world war. “Our European allies, who are highly dependent on Russian energy, require our help,” he said. “As we are seeing – and know from past experience – oil and gas supply can be easily disrupted, either physically or by additional sanctions, significantly impacting energy prices. National security demands energy security for ourselves and for our allies overseas,” he said. The banking chief added that the US response should also involve broader sanctions, a larger US military budget and deploying more troops to Nato’s borders “as appropriate”, adding that the US government should pledge billions of dollars to rebuild Ukraine and support migrants in Europe. “America must be ready for the possibility of an extended war in Ukraine with unpredictable outcomes. We should prepare for the worst and hope for the best. We must look at this as a wake-up call,” the letter urged. “We need to make this a permanent, long-lasting stand for democratic ideals and against all forms of evil.”",News/Business,"JP Morgan could lose up to $1bn through exposure to Russia, says boss",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/04/jp-morgan-could-lose-up-to-1bn-through-exposure-to-russia-says-boss-jamie-dimon-ukraine
4/4/2022,"Another senior Liberal has taken aim at Scott Morrison, accusing him of “self-serving ruthless bullying” and claiming he has “ruined” the Liberal party. Catherine Cusack, a NSW Liberal who announced two weeks ago she would resign from the legislative council over her anger about flood relief, adds her voice to a growing chorus of critics of Morrison from within his own party in an opinion piece for Guardian Australia. Cusack explicitly endorses Liberal senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells’s “character assessment of the prime minister” and reveals she will not vote for the Morrison government in the May election. The prime minister’s office was contacted for comment regarding Cusack’s claims. On Tuesday Fierravanti-Wells labelled the prime minister an “autocrat” and a “bully” in an excoriating Senate speech revealing allegations Morrison had made “racial comments” when running for preselection in 2007. Morrison has vehemently denied the claims, contained in statutory declarations reported in The Saturday Paper and then publicly backed by his preselection opponent, Michael Towke. Cusack accused Morrison of having “ruined” the Liberal party and “trashed” its values over two decades, as state director, “then as a scheming MP and now as prime minister finding loopholes in our constitution to delay preselections in order to get his way”. Cusack criticised Morrison for “forcing moderates to vote for [former Liberal and now United Australia party leader MP] Craig Kelly” when his preselection was under threat before the 2019 election. She has warned she would vote against the prime minister over factional “scheming” and politicised allocation of flood relief. “But he has outdone himself engineering a federal intervention to jump over the organisation all together. “He got what he wanted at the expense of destroying our rules-based selection system and disgusting virtually every member of the NSW division.” Morrison’s immigration minister and proxy in the NSW party, Alex Hawke, has been accused of procedural delays prompting a takeover of federal preselections by a three-person panel, including Morrison and the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet. The NSW court of appeal is set to rule on Tuesday whether the takeover and resultant preselections complied with Liberal party rules. Cusack, a longtime critic of the Liberal party’s culture towards women, has spoken out about the exclusion of Ballina, Byron and Tweed from federal disaster payments, a decision reversed in mid-March. Cusack said that “Scott Morrison’s brazen attempt to fund flood victims in a National party seat and exclude flood victims in a Labor seat that I happen to live in was just too much”. “To see the self-serving ruthless bullying that has increased inside the Liberal party spill over into public policy and the poorest most vulnerable Australians who lost everything in the floods are the targets of this outrageous abuse of morality and power is simply intolerable.” Cusack said assistance was “extended to all northern rivers victims” after their exclusion became too “embarrassing”, but the prime minister now appears to be “refusing to engage NSW government on additional measures that are so needed for victims of this incredible disaster”. “It’s so bad I am moved to endorse Connie’s character assessment of the PM. ‘It’s my way or the highway’. For flood victims. Un-bloody-believable.” Morrison has denied the allegations made by Towke and several Liberal preselectors, that he had warned after the Cronulla Riots a Lebanese Australian could not hold Cook, and discussed a false rumour Towke was a Muslim. These are “completely untrue”, he said. “It is outrageous, absolutely outrageous,” the prime minister said. “I’ve dealt with it time and again, and the leaders of the Lebanese community, I think voices have spoken most significantly about this matter – and just what’s behind all this and I think it’s very clear”. On Monday Towke branded Morrison “a compulsive liar” and declared he does not deserve to be prime minister. “I think it’s pretty obvious he is – he’s got form on that, just ask Tony Abbott, Malcolm Turnbull, Emmanuel Macron … Barnaby Joyce called him out.” On Sunday Morrison blamed the allegations on “individuals who haven’t liked the answer they’ve got” from party preselection processes. “People will throw all sorts of mud at you – particularly when you get up close to an election and they’ll make all sorts of things up because they have other motivations.” Cusack rejected any suggestions of ulterior motives for her critique. “The truth is, there has been no conspiracy in my decision to speak out about Scott Morrison.” “Nobody puts words into my mouth. I am what they call a ‘problem woman’, plus I live in the regions where we just call it out as deserved.” Cusack warned Morrison that “punishing our flood victims” or the NSW government for her decision to speak up is “another chapter in the disgrace of the prime minister’s approach to this flood catastrophe”. Cusack also criticised the federal Liberal party’s handling of climate change, which she said had, “encouraged by the Murdoch press, delayed the urgent need for … action by at least 15 years”. “The climate change fight has divided and just exhausted many of us in the NSW Liberals. “Sitting here in the flood-ravaged northern rivers I can only deplore how much time has been lost.”",News/Australia news,Liberal MP accuses Scott Morrison of ‘ruthless bullying’ and scheming at the expense of flood victims,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/04/liberal-mp-catherine-cusack-scott-morrison-ruthless-bullying-flood-victims
4/4/2022,"Did you know that orgasms can help your hair grow? It’s a fun fact, especially significant for women over the age of 40, because in midlife our hair thins as growth slows down. I know this because as a 53-year-old woman and co-presenter of the podcast Postcards from Midlife, I am now something of an expert on women in this age group. And sex, I have found out, is vital for us – emotionally, physically and culturally. The traditional narrative that the baby boomer generation encountered and passed on to today’s generation who are now in midlife – Generation X – was that women’s sex drives declined with age, while men’s remained the same or increased. There was an assumption that as other things came to dominate our lives – caring for elderly parents, looking after teenagers, dealing with illness, trying to stay relevant at work – our sex lives, much like our physical selves, would become invisible. And of course, juggling all this does affect us – but this notion of a declining sex drive is not only patronising, but also inaccurate. In fact, 40% of midlife women we quizzed in a survey on our Facebook group said they wanted more sex. A total of 56% said they owned at least one sex toy; 65% enjoyed sexual fantasies (though 82% didn’t discuss these with their partners); more than 35% were masturbating at least once a week; and almost 37% were having sex at least once a week. So it seems we didn’t put our love lives in the loft with our vinyl collections. Before I hosted the podcast, I worked as a magazine editor – and served as the editor-in-chief of both Cosmopolitan and Elle during the 00s; my co-host, Trish Halpin, is a former editor of Marie Clare. Between us, we really do know Generation X women inside out. Our generation came of age with Samantha Jones’s racy one-liners in Sex and the City and expert sex tips from the magazines we edited. We were vocal about our desires and libido and need for sex all through our 20s and 30s – so why would we not want that same sovereignty over our sex lives as we age? Sex matters to us. We want more sex because we know from medical studies that intercourse is good for relieving stress and anxiety, which are classic symptoms of the perimenopause (the 10 years of fluctuating hormones before the menopause). It also contributes to keeping our sex organs healthy, helping prevent symptoms of vaginal atrophy, which is estimated to impact 80% of women during menopause – and the increased blood flow of regular orgasms promotes healthy hair, skin and sleep. More importantly perhaps, intimacy; the ever-important communication between you and your partner is also strengthened by sex. As the family therapist Julia Samuel told us on the podcast, the quality of your relationship is the single most important predictor of the quality of your life as you age. And 75% of our listeners surveyed said intimacy was the most important aspect of sex with a partner. Of course, many women in midlife do see a disappointing drop in libido due to a decline in the hormones oestrogen, progesterone and testosterone. We now know that hormone replacement therapy (which is much safer than we were led to believe and is recommended by Nice) relieves women of these symptoms (not to mention reducing the risk of them getting heart disease and osteoporosis). And no-risk oestrogen pessaries, which may become available without prescription, will unlock the desire of thousands of women struggling to have a sex life due to the loss of that hormone in their vagina, which can make sexual intercourse difficult. The very fact that these treatment options are available shows how far we have come. Gen X are not squeamish when it comes to talking about sex; our sex lives are not secret, and many of us are forthright about arguing for what we need to support our blossoming midlife love lives (just watch Davina McCall’s groundbreaking Channel 4 documentary Sex, Myths and the Menopause). This newfound understanding of the perimenopause has put us on the brink of a new sexual revolution, liberating an army of women to seek what they need to keep them healthy and happy. Women in midlife are not going to be limited by GPs’ woeful misunderstanding of our health – in 2019, over two thirds of GPs had wrongly prescribed antidepressants instead of HRT – something clearly warned against in the Nice guidelines on treating menopause. Gen X is good at asking for what we need: we have been doing it for our whole lives so far. When I was editing Cosmo, one of my male bosses once told me to stop running features on anal sex. “No woman enjoys that, so stop writing about it,” he said. “But I have a postbag of letters from women who tell me this is one of the things they want to experience, which is why I am writing about it,” I replied, perplexed by his logic when faced with the evidence. “Women don’t know what they want,” he said. How wrong he was. We want intimacy, orgasms and, yes, thicker hair.
