3/15/2022,"Ralf Rangnick wants Manchester United fans to be the “12th and 13th player” on Tuesday night at Old Trafford when his team bids to knock out Atlético Madrid and reach the Champions League quarter-finals. United have reached the last eight only twice since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 – the following year and in 2019 – and with the tie poised at 1-1 after the first leg Rangnick said he was looking for the home fans to make the same difference as they did in the 3-2 win over Tottenham on Saturday. “Quite like in the game against Spurs we need our players and supporters to be on top form on Tuesday night,” he said. “Our supporters play a vital role and it’s always a very special atmosphere at Old Trafford – even more so for international [European] games. They can be our 12th and 13th player on the pitch and make the difference – making it a very special experience for everyone. In the end it’s up to us, we have to create those moments and then the rest will come from our fantastic supporters. “The supporters are the ones we can rely on and what kind of energy that happens [comes from them] is up to us. Antonio Conte said on Saturday that it was a very difficult atmosphere for them to play and that’s probably one of the biggest compliments you can get: if the opposition manager says that after the game.” Alex Telles echoed Rangnick’s sentiment. “The support is extremely important,” said the defender. “If we play well the fans will always be behind us. We feel that when we’re at home. We have fantastic fans and they’re very positive and we react positively to that – that’s how it was against Spurs and I think it will be the same against Atlético: we’re really happy with the fans.” Bruno Fernandes is set to return, having missed the Spurs win because of Covid. He has now tested negative. “That’s the reason why he could train today [Monday],” Rangnick said. “As it is right now we have all the players available tomorrow. There’s a small question mark over Luke Shaw – he was training yesterday [Sunday] and today. We have to wait and see if he’s fully fit to be available for the game. All the other players are back in training and available.” The Champions League is the last competition United can win. Rangnick is intent that they progress to the next round to match the club’s status as three-times winners. “For us it’s about our own sporting ambition – we’re highly ambitious and we want to proceed and show we can compete with the best teams in Europe,” he said. “We have a fantastic opportunity to be in the top eight teams of Europe if we beat them on Tuesday and that’s exactly what we’re trying to achieve. The game against Tottenham showed the level we can play and with another 10 or 20% on top of that I’m sure we can win.” Regarding Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored a hat-trick against Spurs, Rangnick has no concerns about the 37-year-old having to play again only 72 hours later. “I’m not worried that he has not been able to recover,” the 63-year-old said. “So far he’s always been a person who looks after himself and his body and he knows what to do. I’m not worried about that. If he can score another three we will see. It’s not so easy to score three goals against this team at all. His overall performance was good if not even very good [against Spurs] and this is what we hope to get from him again tomorrow night. He’s still a very important player for this team and it will be good for us if he has a similar performance to the one against Tottenham. “It’s not just about Cristiano – it’s about the whole team. We saw in the first half in Madrid [when conceding after seven minutes] what we shouldn’t do and how we should not play and this was obviously a big topic for us yesterday and today when we spoke about the game. We have to know what it takes: what it tactically takes and then the rest is about energy. We had a team against Spurs that just wanted to win that game, and it became obvious and the supporters played a vital role because they realised how much we wanted to win that game and tomorrow will be similar.”",Sport/Football,Ralf Rangnick says fan factor can inspire Manchester United to win over Atlético,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/14/ralf-rangnick-says-fan-factor-can-inspire-manchester-united-to-win-over-atletico
3/15/2022,"Boris Johnson is facing criticism both domestically and in the Gulf as he tries to persuade Gulf states to boost oil production. He is expected to visit Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states such as the United Arab Emirates as western powers seek extra oil supplies to loosen the west’s dependence on Russian energy and slow the massive price rises caused by sanctions due to the war in Ukraine. The US president, Joe Biden, has poor relations with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, making Britain one of the most plausible western powers to persuade Saudi and the UAE to boost production. But Johnson is facing domestic opposition to going to Saudi Arabia days after the Kingdom beheaded 81 “criminals and terrorists” at the weekend, the largest mass execution in Saudi history. Seven of those executed were from Yemen. The Saudi court would have been aware the killings would make Johnson’s visit harder and will be seen as sign of Saudi independence from the west. It was also a sign of defiance towards Iran with which Saudi had been slowly building improved relations. The two sides are in different sides in the Yemen civil war. Neither Saudi or the UAE are keen to boost oil production since it would break up their oil pact with Russia known as the Opec +. The Saudis have said they will not pump more than they agreed to last year as part of a deal with Russia. That pact allows for production increases of 400,000 barrels a day each month, but it has done little to stem the rise in oil prices, and the Saudis have pumped less than their share, according to the International Energy Agency. There is hostility in parts of the UAE for failing to show swift and strong solidarity after January’s missile strikes fired by Houthis that hit Abu Dhabi, killing three and damaging the international airport. The UK was not among the first to send a public message of sympathy. By contrast the French offered to supplement UAE air defence systems in a gesture that was appreciated by senior UAE diplomats. One source said: “Such steps might seem trivial but they are noticed. It’s sometimes the simple easy messages that matter. It means you are not making contact only when you want something.” The UK has also been slow in some observers’ eyes to back calls for the Houthi northern rebels in Yemen to be labelled as a terrorist organisation something the UK has been reluctant to do fearing it would make it harder for humanitarian groups to operate in Yemen. Saudis and the UAE have been backing a six-year military struggle to prevent the Houthis seizing power. The attacks on Abu Dhabi were in retaliation for progress made by UAE backed forces in Yemen. Gulf states were also left unimpressed when Downing Street appeared to downgrade the Gulf in its list of Foreign Office priorities by abolishing the post of Foreign Office Middle East minister, and merging the role with a wider portfolio. Boris Johnson’s extrovert style remains popular in the Gulf, but there is a feeling that he has ignored the region. Ironically, in the UK, he is regarded as too close to authoritarian states and too prone to put arms sales ahead of human rights.",News/World news,Johnson criticised for cosiness to Saudis but Gulf feels ignored,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/johnson-criticised-saudis-gulf-oil-production
3/15/2022,"Ford has accelerated its electric vehicle plans for Europe, launching seven new models, announcing a battery gigafactory in Turkey, doubling investment in Germany and the phasing out emissions from vans by 2035. The US manufacturer had previously pledged to make all cars in Europe electric by 2030 but had not set an end date for commercial vehicles. The move casts further doubt on the future of Ford’s Dagenham plant in the UK, which makes diesel engines for Transit vans. Ford said it would launch seven new electric models in Europe by 2024, and was targeting sales of 600,000 EVs a year on the continent by 2026 – a vast increase. Its sole model currently on sale, the Mustang Mach E imported from Mexico, sold just 23,000 units in 2021. Ford restructured its businesses earlier this month to focus its efforts to catch up with rivals in electric vehicle manufacturing. Ford of Europe chairman Stuart Rowley said the company was “stepping into our future” and “capitalising on our strengths to build a thriving, profitable business, while also doing our part to protect the planet”. He said: “We’re delivering for customers in Europe, with the focus and speed of a startup at the leading edge of technology, supported by the deep expertise in engineering and high-volume production.” Asked about Ford in the UK, Rowley said: “Although by 2035 we’ll be all-electric, the diesel segment in light commercial vans in the medium term will remain very important so Dagenham is a key contributor to that business.” Rowley said Ford had been “an important partner in the UK automotive industry for over 100 years now and that remains absolutely the case”. Last October it invested £230m to upgrade its Halewood plant in Merseyside for making electric vehicle parts. New petrol and diesel vans will be banned from sale in the UK from 2030. Ford will meanwhile be investing $2bn at its Cologne site and deepening its partnership with Volkswagen to double the number of cars built using its drive technology, to 1.2m vehicles over six years. It has also signed a memorandum of understanding for a joint venture to build one of Europe’s largest battery factories, manufacturing nickel cells at a plant near Ankara, with backing from the Turkish government. An electric version of the Puma, Ford’s bestselling passenger vehicle in Europe last year, will be available from 2024, to be manufactured at the global firm’s plant in Craiova, Romania.",News/Business,Ford accelerates electric vehicle push in Europe with seven new models,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/14/ford-accelerates-electric-vehicle-push-in-europe-with-seven-new-models
3/15/2022,"All remaining Covid travel restrictions are to be dropped in England from later this week, government sources have said, despite a concerning rise in cases and hospitalisations. Ministers approved the scrapping of passenger locator forms and the requirement for all unvaccinated arrivals to get tested, with the changes expected to come into force from 4am on Friday. Tory MPs and the aviation industry had put pressure on the government to make the move before Easter, given all domestic restrictions have already been repealed. The announcement was expected to be confirmed by the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, later on Monday afternoon. Given that health restrictions are a devolved matter, it will be up to the governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland whether to follow suit. However, they have often kept pace with England on decisions affecting international travel. It comes as Britain’s Covid situation deteriorated further, with health officials concerned that the number of people being hospitalised with the virus was also growing at a fast rate. In the past week, 399,820 positive cases have been recorded – an increase of 56.3%. The number of patients admitted to hospital has also risen steeply to 9,475 – 16.9% up on the previous week. Boris Johnson’s spokesperson on Monday insisted there was no need for any fresh restrictions to help curb the spread of the virus. He said the prime minister was “keeping a close eye on the data” but that “at the moment, we don’t see anything nearing any of the sorts of pressures we saw at the peak of the pandemic, when such large proportions of the population weren’t vaccinated or boosted”. He added: “We obviously will always have contingency plans, but the prime minister and others have talked about how the vaccination and our therapeutics mean we will not need to return to the lockdowns of the past that saw such significant measures be necessary.” The health secretary, Sajid Javid, also said the UK was in a “very good position” given the take-up of vaccines, and that a rise in infection rates was to be expected. To reduce the risk of serious infection, he urged adults eligible for a booster vaccine to have one, given that one in five had not yet received it. Last month, Johnson significantly loosened remaining Covid restrictions, announcing that those with the virus were no longer required to isolate and that free mass testing would end from 1 April. Self-isolation support payments were also jettisoned, while sick pay rules reverted to less generous pre-pandemic arrangements.",News/World news,Covid travel restrictions for England to be dropped despite rise in cases,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/covid-travel-restrictions-for-england-to-be-dropped-despite-rise-in-cases
3/15/2022,"My friend Hashir Faruqi, who has died aged 92, was a scientist of Pakistani heritage who found his vocation as a journalist and community activist after settling in London in the early 1960s. He launched the bi-monthly Impact International magazine in 1971 from a modest office in north London, and ran it on a shoestring budget for 35 years, providing English-reading Muslims with news and analysis from an independent, post-colonial perspective. At its peak it had 28,000 subscribers in 85 countries and 80,000 readers. Faruqi was also a guiding figure in initiatives that gave British Muslims a voice in the public space, including as a founding trustee and chairman of the Islamic Foundation and as a trustee of Muslim Aid. His vision for the Muslim Council of Britain when it was launched in 1997 was for it to eschew fatwa-giving and act as an umbrella body working for the common good – advice which the council took up. Faruqi was born in Benares (now Varanasi) in pre-partition India to Sufairah Syed, a housewife, and her husband, Nizamul Haq, a tax inspector. He graduated with a degree in entomology from Kanpur Agricultural College, where he was secretary of the Muslim students’ union, and after migrating to Pakistan in 1953 he worked at the ministry of agriculture. He was on deputation to Saudi Arabia for a year, and in 1963 went to Imperial College London to to do research into locust control, remaining in the UK for the rest of his life. In the UK, Faruqi began contributing to weekly meetings of the London Islamic Circle at Regent’s Lodge, now the site of the London Central Mosque. I first encountered him there when, as a wet-behind-the-ears A-level student, I was being harangued by a hardcore Arab nationalist and Faruqi stepped in to extract me from the situation. He worked initially as a community organiser at the UK Islamic Mission, but also wrote a satirical column for the magazine the Muslim, and after several years decided to set up Impact International. He supported himself solely, if frugally, on revenues from the magazine, later refusing offers of better paid journalistic work in favour of maintaining his integrity and independence. In 1980 Faruqi found himself in the news rather than analysing it, when the Iranian embassy siege began in London. He had been visiting the embassy to seek a journalistic interview, and ended up among the 26 hostages taken by a terrorist group, showing coolness under fire. Impact International ceased publication in 2006 but Faruqi’s small flat in Kilburn, north-west London, continued to be an essential stopping point for scholars, poets and activists. Friends will long remember these salons, which would often feature impromptu poetry recital contests and were graced with his home cooking. Faruqi’s wife, Fakhra Begum, whom he married in Benares in 1954, predeceased him. He is survived by their daughter, Sadia, and sons, Ausaf, Rafay and Irfan.",News/World news,Hashir Faruqi obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/hashir-faruqi-obituary
3/15/2022,"Petrol could soar to £2.50 a litre, while diesel could hit £3 and might even be rationed, experts told MPs on Monday, as they warned of worsening pain for consumers as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine hits global energy markets. Prices at the pump have already soared in recent weeks, reaching a succession of highs amid the Ukraine crisis. The latest figures from the data firm Experian Catalist show the average cost of a litre of petrol was 163.5p on Sunday, while diesel was 173.4p. However, in testimony to the Treasury select committee, experts said prices could increase much further, with diesel – heavily reliant on Russian supplies – potentially doubling. “Consumers need to get ready for continued rises in fuel prices,” said Nathan Piper, the head of oil and gas research at Investec bank. Asked about how high the cost of fuel could go, he said: “Not to be flippant but pick a number.” Amrita Sen, a founding partner and the chief oil analyst at the research consultancy Energy Aspects, said the group was working on the assumption that oil could “easily” rise by 50%. She said: “If you do it on the basis of crude oil, we’re saying it could easily go up by 50%. Assuming no tax changes implemented by the government, [petrol] could end up being £2.40 per litre.” She said that because of diesel’s role in industry, it “could go to £2.50, even closer to £3. That’s definitely within the realms of possibility.” Sen added that diesel was likely to be rationed in Germany before the end of March and that the same could happen in the UK.",Lifestyle/Money,"UK petrol prices could hit £2.50 a litre and diesel £3, experts tell MPs",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/14/uk-petrol-prices-diesel-experts-tell-mps-russia-ukraine
3/15/2022,"We’ll be honest with you: The Fiver went big on the struggles of Everton last week because we thought we’d get our trademark cheap digs in while the going was good. After all, they’d surely pick up six points from their matches in the Goodison cauldron against Wolves and Newcastle, whereupon any notions of impending relegation would become fanciful and the chance to riff, bebop and scat on Frank Lampard’s pain would be gone. The mental gymnastics we have to perform, eh, readers? We go to these extra lengths just for you. You deserve it. Nil Satis Nisi Optimum, right? However, as we watched the blood drain from Lampard’s face yesterday afternoon, supporters segueing seamlessly from supportive cheering to booing to a crisp, clear snatch of You’re Not Fit To Wear The Shirt, we began to wonder if the unthinkable was starting to occur in plain sight in front of our very eyes. We’ve seen that grey, glazed expression of confused impotence on Merseyside before – Mike Walker, Roy Hodgson, Jimmy Corkhill – and it rarely ends well. The miserable 1-0 defeat to Wolves means the Ev are now only out of the relegation places on goal difference, with rejuvenated 18th-placed Watford breathing down their necks, and the aforementioned Hodgson, merely by adding a pair of wire spectacles, now transformed into a windswept romantic with a vague similarity to late-era WB Yeats. A terrible beauty is born. Lampard, in one of those excruciating Fronting Up post-match interviews, insisted that “we have belief” and that his team will “keep fighting for it”. That’s the sort of tough talk that used to work so well at peak-Jose Chelsea – Claude Makélélé, John Terry, all that – but doesn’t land so firmly when you’re relying on Dele Alli and Jarrad Branthwaite. Everton still have matches in hand on those around them at the bottom, but should they fail to pick up all three points later this week against a Newcastle team suddenly good enough to give the European and world champions a game, that might not count for too much, because the rest of that run-in is testing, to say the very least.

3/15/2022,"As the blockbuster continued its unstoppable ascent in the 1980s, an antidote of sorts could be found in many of the films of the actor William Hurt, who has died aged 71 of cancer. With his floppy blond hair, high forehead and droll, methodical voice, he exhibited a cerebral presence and an enviable range. He could seem erudite, threatening or suave, though he was at his most interesting playing men who were demonstrably less intelligent than he was. These included a dim-witted but charismatic TV anchor in Broadcast News (1987) and a brutish gangster hunting his own brother in A History of Violence (2005). He was Oscar-nominated for both those films, as well as for his performance as a teacher at a school for deaf students in Children of a Lesser God (1986). He won the best actor award only once, for playing an extravagantly camp gay inmate spinning stories in a South American prison in Kiss of the Spider Woman (1985). His victory left him feeling torn. “When they called my name out, I really thought, ‘Oh no, no, no, no, don’t put that target on my chest, don’t do this,’” he said in 2010. Having established himself in the 70s as a stage actor, Hurt initially turned down all movie offers. This inbuilt reluctance made his film work, when it finally came, feel fascinatingly conflicted, as though he was regarding the medium itself with scepticism. Reviewing his debut film, Altered States (1980), in which he starred as a scientist dabbling in genetic regression experiments, the critic Pauline Kael identified his “cool, quivering untrustworthiness… [he plays] the kind of cunning maniac who’s always watching to see how people react to his mania.” As he matured, his appearance changed from preppy to professorial, and he became a regular fixture in the sorts of films to which he had once provided an alternative. If younger modern audiences knew him at all, it was from his recurring role as a US general in Marvel superhero adventures such as Captain America: Civil War (2016), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), Avengers: Endgame (2019) and Black Widow (2021). He was born in Washington DC, to Claire (nee McGill), a business manager at Time, and Alfred Hurt, a diplomat who worked in US foreign assistance. After the couple divorced when William was six (his mother remarried in 1960, becoming Claire McGill Luce), he travelled with his father during his various postings, living in cities including Khartoum and Mogadishu. He was educated at the Middlesex school in Massachusetts, where he first began acting, then at Tufts University in the same state, and the Juilliard School in New York, where he studied drama. His work with that city’s Circle Repertory Company, where he was a performer from 1977 until 1982, brought him special acclaim. It was in 1978 that he happened to bump into the producer Howard Gottfried, who was having trouble finding an actor to play the lead in a film that Paddy Chayefsky had written about a scientist obsessed with the origins of life. After intensive meetings with the director Arthur Penn, Hurt eventually agreed to take on the part in Altered States. By the time shooting began, Penn had been replaced by the controversial British film-maker Ken Russell; relations between Russell and Chayefksy became so volatile that the writer took his name off the film. Nevertheless, Hurt’s intensity provided the movie with an emotional grounding during its more outlandish passages. He quickly became the face of the slow-burning, adult-oriented thriller. He was a lawyer drawn into a passionate affair with a woman (Kathleen Turner) who persuades him to murder her husband in the modern noir Body Heat (1981). He was superb as an orderly who lies about his proximity to a murder in order to ingratiate himself with a TV journalist (Sigourney Weaver) in Eyewitness (1981), which was released in the UK as The Janitor. In the sombre cold war mystery Gorky Park, scripted by Dennis Potter, he was a Russian police inspector. He had a chance to show a lighter side in The Big Chill (also 1983), an ensemble comedy-drama about a group of former college activists (the cast also included Glenn Close, Jeff Goldblum and Tom Berenger) who have fallen short of their youthful ideals. Lawrence Kasdan, who directed Body Heat and The Big Chill, cast Hurt in two further films: The Accidental Tourist (1988), where he was a grieving travel writer reawakened by his relationship with a dog-trainer (Geena Davis), and the slapstick comedy I Love You to Death (1990), in which he and Keanu Reeves played the stoners hired to kill a philandering restaurateur (Kevin Kline). Hurt also continued working in theatre. He received a Tony nomination for his performance in Mike Nichols’s 1985 production of David Rabe’s Hurlyburly, and returned to the Circle Repertory Company in 1989 for the first time in seven years to star in Joe Pintauro’s play Beside Herself. Once that decade was over, Hurt’s lustre seemed to fade. He had a small role in Woody Allen’s Alice (1990) and took the lead in Wim Wenders’s sprawling science-fiction odyssey Until the End of the World (1991). He was ideally cast as Mr Rochester in Franco Zeffirelli’s 1996 adaptation of Jane Eyre, but Nora Ephron’s sentimental fable Michael (also 1996), in which he was a journalist sent to report on a real-life angel (John Travolta), was a misstep. He looked out of place in the intergalactic romp Lost in Space (1998) but did sympathetic work as a paternal scientist in Steven Spielberg’s AI Artificial Intelligence (2001). He was intriguing and faintly sinister as a pastor visited by the son he disowned in The King. His Oscar nomination for A History of Violence heralded a comeback: he appeared with George Clooney and Matt Damon in the political drama Syriana (also 2005), with Damon again in Robert De Niro’s thriller The Good Shepherd (2006) and as the father of a young man who goes off-grid in Sean Penn’s Into the Wild (2007). He had a recurring role in 2009 on the legal drama Damages. In the same year, he starred in the television film Endgame as the philosophy professor Willie Esterhuyse, who was instrumental in secret talks to end apartheid in South Africa. “He hits the half notes in a role that could too easily have been conventionally righteous,” said the New York Times. Later films included Ridley Scott’s version of Robin Hood (2010) starring Russell Crowe. Hurt was honest about his struggles with alcoholism earlier in his life, and did not dispute the allegations of physical and sexual abuse made against him by Marlee Matlin, his former partner and co-star in Children of a Lesser God, in her 2009 autobiography I’ll Scream Later. “I did and do apologise for any pain I caused,” he said. However, he denied similar allegations made by an earlier partner, the dancer Sandra Jennings. He married Mary Beth Supinger (the actor Mary Beth Hurt) in 1971; they divorced in 1982. His second marriage, in 1989, to Heidi Henderson ended in divorce in 1992. He is survived by his four children: Alexander, from his relationship with Jennings; William Jr and Samuel, from his marriage to Henderson; and Jeanne, from his relationship with the actor Sandrine Bonnaire.

3/15/2022,"Timmy Thomas, whose spellbinding anti-war song Why Can’t We Live Together was a global hit in 1973, has died aged 77. No cause of death has been given. His family wrote on his Facebook page: “With appreciation and gratitude, the family extends a thank you for the prayers, support, precious words and other expressions of love and kindness during this time.” With its organ chords, rudimentary drum machine rhythm and heartfelt vocals from Thomas, Why Can’t We Live Together remains one of the most striking and minimalist R&B songs of the 1970s. It reached No 3 in the US and No 12 in the UK; its lyrics of pacifism and racial harmony chimed with listeners amid the still-raging Vietnam war. Notable cover versions are by Sade on multi-platinum 1984 debut album Diamond Life; MC Hammer on 1991’s Too Legit to Quit; Steve Winwood for 2003’s About Time; and Lonnie Liston Smith with Iggy Pop on vocals, released in 2021. The song was also sped up and sampled by Drake for one of his biggest hits, 2016 single Hotline Bling, which went Top 3 in the US and UK and introduced Thomas’s song to a new generation of listeners. “I was very proud to listen to what he had done with it, even though he had changed the message that I had,” Thomas said. Thomas was born in Indiana in 1944 , one of 12 siblings. He studied jazz under Cannonball Adderley and Donald Byrd but segued into playing soul music after further music studies at Lane College in Jackson, Ten­nessee, picking up sessions with Stax records and the smaller label Goldwax, where he cut his first solo singles. He settled in Miami, and began working as a teacher – it was during preparation for a class that inspiration for Why Can’t We Live Together hit, after a radio broadcast from Walter Cronkite announcing tens of thousands of deaths on both sides in Vietnam. An accompanying album, also called Why Can’t We Live Together, reached No 10 in the US, and though Thomas couldn’t replicate his hit song’s success, he released six further albums. He also continued to work as a session musician, songwriter and producer, with artists including Gwen McCrae and Betty Wright.

3/15/2022,"Plans to remove a street-corner memorial to Daunte Wright have been put on hold, after protests from the family of the 20-year old Black man who was killed by a Minnesota police officer during a traffic stop last year. “If they want to not have memorials on their street corners they need to stop murdering our loved ones on street corners,” said Wright’s mother, Katie Wright. The announcement of the plan to remove the memorial in Brooklyn Center, a city near Minneapolis, came nearly a month after a former police officer, Kim Potter, was sentenced to 24 months in prison for manslaughter. Potter killed Wright after he was stopped for minor traffic violations. She said she grabbed her gun and fired in error, thinking she was holding her stun gun. The killing prompted widespread protests, as one of many high-profile cases involving Black victims of white police officers in cities across the US. At sentencing, the judge, Regina Chu, said Potter was a “respected officer” who was “acting in the line of duty” when she shot and killed Wright. In response, Wright’s father, Aubrey Wright, broke down in tears and said: “I feel cheated. I feel hurt. I’m upset that my son’s life was taken, and it seemed to me nobody even cared enough.” On Friday, a month before the first anniversary of Wright’s death, Brooklyn Center officials said a memorial erected at the intersection where Wright was killed would be taken down. In an email, the city manager, Reggie Edwards, wrote that authorities “anticipate[d] reopening the sidewalk/trail at 63rd and Kathrene early next week”, and mentioned several options about preserving memorial material. Edwards said the city could store the material, which includes flowers and posters, or ask volunteers if they wanted to archive them. But in an interview with the Star Tribune newspaper on Sunday, Wright’s mother, Katie Wright, said: “Leave the memorial because it’s honestly not hurting anybody but it will hurt a lot of people taking it down.” She and her husband, along with the family’s attorney, Jeff Storms, were due to meet Edwards and the city attorney, Troy Gilchrist, on Tuesday. In an email to the family and memorial volunteers, Edwards said Brooklyn Center was “committed to developing a permanent memorial in memory of Daunte”. However, according to Katie Wright, locations proposed by officials were not at the intersection where her son was killed and instead included a nearby park and the police station. Katie Wright said: “As a family, we want people to remember what happened there. I don’t want it to go away. Once it goes away, it’s forgotten about, it didn’t happen. “It’s so easy for history to be erased when it’s not right in front of our faces.”",News/US news,Daunte Wright: backlash over plan to move police killing victim’s memorial,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/14/daunte-wright-memorial-move-backlash-minnesota
3/15/2022,"Australia’s soaring cost of living is outstripping wage increases, leaving the average worker more than $800 worse off in 2021, the steepest cut in real terms for more than 20 years, according to Australian Council of Trade Unions president, Michele O’Neil. The contraction in spending power happened during Covid supply chain shortages, while Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has only propelled prices of fuel and food higher. In a speech to the Australia Institute on Tuesday, O’Neil will say a worker on the average income of $68,000 last year effectively had a pay cut of $832 as price increases overwhelmed any meagre wage increases. In 2021, consumer prices rose 3.5% and wages 2.3%, the ABS said. “Shockingly, it is actually worse for the workers who have been on the frontline keeping the country going during the pandemic,” O’Neil will say, citing ACTU analysis showing employees in healthcare and social support saw their real pay shrink $967 last year. Staff in transport, postal and warehousing – who were “risking their health and safety to keep the nation running” – went backwards by $1,497, education and training workers by $1,362, while those in admin and support services shrank by $1,185. Wage rises have consistently undershot budgetary forecasts even as unemployment rates have fallen. Researchers blame the weak growth in part on increased casualisation of work, giving employees less clout when they bargain with bosses. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The cost of living issue has been compounded by nine years of low wage growth, continued attacks on workers’ rights and conditions, and the increases under this government of casual and insecure work,” O’Neil will say, adding the wages forecast would be “the most important element” in the government’s 2022-23 budget due 29 March. Australia has 2.4 million casual workers with millions more on labour hire, fixed-term, or sham contracting arrangements, “or suffering under other corporate strategies to cut their wages”, she said. Qantas flight attendants, for instance, faced a “staggering” $27,000 cut in annual salary if the airline succeeds in ripping up their enterprise agreement, O’Neil will say. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, though, said he wouldn’t “take lectures from the unions or the Labor party on wages”, adding that when Labor was last in office, real wages were falling and unemployment was rising at 5.7% compared to 4.2% now.The government’s tax cuts had seen more than $29 billion flow to 11.5 million Australians since the onset of the pandemic, “ensuring hard working Australians keep more of what they earn”, Frydenberg said. Household disposable income had remained strong, rising 11.1% on pre-pandemic levels, or more than the 4.4% increase in prices over that time. However, Mike Sadler, a former IT technician retraining to be a primary school teacher, feared the looming price hikes would stretch his family’s budget more than during the pandemic. “If you stay at home, you don’t go out and don’t see anyone, and your kids don’t go to other people’s birthday parties, you can actually survive in this town,” said Sadler, 61, who shifted his family out of Sydney to the Riverina town of Wagga Wagga several years ago to seek lower-cost housing to match their limited budget. The Covid supplement has now gone, petrol prices were “unbelievable”, and rising prices meant the family has had to find extra savings such as giving up fresh potatoes for the cheaper frozen chips sold in a local supermarket. “We’ve really been squeezed,” Sadler said. “I feel it’s going to get harder.” The Food and Agriculture Organisation was among international agencies warning of more to come. The United Nations agency last week predicted food and feed eaten by livestock would rise as much as 22% above their already elevated prices. Global #foodprices rise to record high in February, led by vegetable oils & dairy products.The @FAO Food Price Index averaged 140.7 points in Feb, up 3.9% from Jan, & 3.1 points higher than in Feb 2011.World wheat & maize production seen rising in 2022https://t.co/PPgoW3NqMO Assuming the disruptions are prolonged, “the global number of undernourished people could increase by 8 to 13 million people in 2022-23, with the most pronounced increases taking place in Asia-Pacific, followed by sub-Saharan Africa, and the Near East and north Africa”, the FAO said. Head of RaboResearch in Australia, Stefan Vogel, said markets had largely taken into account the disruption to Ukraine’s wheat crop but not the spring-sown crops of sunflower seeds and corn. Increases in the prices of these crops could follow. Australian farmers weren’t necessarily going to be big beneficiaries, though, with fuel and fertiliser costs rising more quickly than prices for some products. Crop prices “have moved higher but not anywhere close to [those in] Europe or the US”, he said. Energy prices, meanwhile had doubled in a year while fertiliser prices were 90% to 160% higher. Vogel expects the impact on food prices to be sustained, not least because energy prices were likely to stay high as supply disruptions and sanctions linger even if the war were to be halted in the near term. “I think the grain market has to work through this [shock] not only in the next two months, but probably the next two years,” he said.",News/Australia news,"Average Australian worker went backwards by $800 in 2021, says ACTU chief Michele O’Neil",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/15/average-australian-worker-went-backwards-by-800-in-2021-says-actu-chief-michele-oneil
3/15/2022,"“I can’t find a heartbeat. The foetus is dead.” Imagine walking into an ultrasound suite, filled to the brim with excitement, ready to see your new baby on screen, maybe even in 3D. Instead, the worst minutes of your life unfold before your eyes. As you look back, what you remember isn’t how you felt, it isn’t the last time you saw your baby lying there, motionless, on the screen. The thing you remember most was the feeling of the sonographer’s words hitting you like a slap across the face. The brutal blow of each phrase. Even now, years later, they still feel sore, like a bruise. As an advocate and journalist investigating early pregnancy loss in this country, I hear this story, or variations of it, every single day. Like all aspects of medicine and medical care, there are a multitude of skills that make a clinician an excellent practitioner. The ability to retain information, to put together seemingly disparate symptoms to come up with a diagnosis. Or maybe catch the things that others have missed. Some need the surgical abilities to operate under pressure or suture up a wound so perfectly there’s no scar at all. These are skills that can elevate clinicians to some of the highest levels of medicine. But one thing all clinicians need is the ability to be empathetic, to care about their patients or to adequately articulate information, whether good or bad. Good news is a much easier proposition. But bad news can be catastrophic. And, unfortunately, the people conducting ultrasound are not always empowered or taught how to engage in this sort of conversation. When delivered badly it can contribute to years of compounded trauma or even mental illness. Especially in the world of miscarriage, but also any adverse pregnancy outcomes. Another common story I hear is one of total silence. The healthcare worker conducting the ultrasound who doesn’t look at you, much less speak to you. You leave the clinic without any information, at least happy you got to see your little peanut in black and white. Then, out of nowhere, you get a phone call from your doctor. It’s not good news. All you want is to be able to turn back time, walk back into the room, and have a moment to look on the screen and say goodbye. If you’d known, maybe you would have asked for a photo. But instead you just had silence. Perhaps even a nod when you asked if everything looked OK. In a cultural shift, the Australasian Society for Ultrasound in Medicine is set to announce the release of guidelines for parent-centred communication in obstetric ultrasound. Asum acknowledges that ultrasound professionals need support to know how to deliver bad news to patients, but also that patients have the right to hear what’s going on rather than wait in a vacuum where they have no idea there’s a problem, are anxious because they know there’s a problem but they don’t know what it is or they have had previous problems in pregnancy and need peace of mind. Development of the guidelines was initiated by Samantha Thomas, inspired by the work of her PhD, which she completed two years ago at the University of Sydney. She led a multi-disciplinary team comprising medical professionals, sonographers, patient advocates and academics. “Many sonographers were stressed because they did not have any training or consistent departmental protocols which encourage a collaborative approach and gave them the support needed when faced with unexpected or adverse obstetric findings,” she says. The guidelines are targeted at a wide range of people, including student and qualified sonographers, radiologists, obstetricians, specialists, nurses and midwives. They have been trialled in a pilot rollout in Perth and Sydney, with Asum reporting a “high rate of parent and clinician satisfaction”. “Sonographers are on the frontline conducting these scans and parents are telling us delayed communication from the day of the scan until the next time they see a doctor concerns them,” says Asum’s chief executive, Lyndal Macpherson. “This is not only about communicating findings with parents but also equipping sonographers to share their communication with the reporting doctor so there is a clear understanding of the information being shared across all professionals in the care team.” Patient-centred care is the much-lauded holy grail of best-practice medicine but, in an age where our medical system is hideously under-funded, too often patients are made to feel on the outer of their own care. It’s an important step forward to recognise the trauma of adverse or even just challenging findings during pregnancy. These guidelines will go a huge way to supporting the parents who don’t enjoy the happy, joyous, problem-free pregnancy that everyone hopes for when they start the journey towards parenthood.",Opinion/Opinion,"When it comes to delivering would-be parents the worst news in the world, we can and must do better | Isabelle Oderberg",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/15/when-it-comes-to-delivering-would-be-parents-the-worst-news-in-the-world-we-can-and-must-do-better
3/15/2022,"Despite the fact most of us have to do laundry at least once a week, the correct way to wash clothes sometimes feels shrouded in mystery. From the cryptic symbols on care labels to the long list of ingredients in detergents, doing laundry can be quite perplexing. This week, experts share their intel on how we should be washing our clothes. To start with, let’s decode the pictures on garment care labels. Anything that looks like a bucket filled with water is explaining how to wash something; a square is telling you how to dry something; an iron is well … about ironing. Certain things are uniform across all these symbols: a cross means do not wash, dry or iron. Dots inside the symbol refer to heat: one dot is cool, two is warm, three is hot. For washing and drying, two lines beneath the symbol means use a delicate cycle. Often the buckets have a numerical temperature instead of dots, which is pretty self-explanatory. As are some of the other symbols; for instance, a bucket with a hand means handwash. The meaning of others is more opaque: a circle refers to dry-cleaning while the letters inside instruct dry-cleaners on which chemicals to use; two lines with a cross beneath an iron means no steam and finally, triangles refer to bleach and chlorine. Machine-drying is symbolised by a circle inside the square. For drying naturally, the squares have lines to illustrate how a garment should be positioned. Hang dry (a semicircle from the top), drip dry (three vertical lines), dry flat (horizontal lines) and dry in shade (three lines in the corner). A symbol that looks like a propellor means do not wring. Laundry guru and author Shannon Lush says she separates her laundry into five baskets: whites, colourfast, reds, darks and handwashing. Sorting like this is important to prevent any dyes from bleeding into one another during washing and helps determine what cycle and water temperature to use. According to Lush, “it doesn’t matter which washing powder or liquid detergent you use” because the difference between them is relatively superficial and often comes down to scent. She says you may as well buy “the cheapest detergent”. Choose powder or liquid detergent depending on whether your machine is a top- or front-loader. The consumer advocacy group Choice says powder detergent is better for top-loaders, while liquids perform better in front-loaders. If you’re interested, they have also tested and ranked the best laundry detergents on the market. The bad news is eco-detergents are not as effective as regular detergents. In fact, sometimes they’re only marginally better than washing with plain water. Lush says this is because eco-detergents “don’t break the surface tension on the water as well, which means the water can’t get in to get stains and muck out”. If you are concerned about the environment, Choice says liquid detergents are generally more eco-friendly. As for the packaging, there are an ever-increasing number of refillable liquid detergents available, both from some Coles and Woolworths branches, and online from Zero Co, Dirt, Unpackaged, Cove and more. Another way to save the environment (and money) is to use less detergent in each wash. Through testing, Choice revealed most laundry detergents perform just as well at half the recommended dose. Because of a societal obsession with cleanliness, and misunderstanding how soap works, Lush says almost everyone uses too much detergent. “Being sparing with soap is actually better because it cleans better,” she says – and it won’t leave powder or detergent residue behind on your clothes and towels. Lush also has her own formula to improve your wash. If you have a top-loader, she recommends using a quarter of whatever the directions on the laundry detergent say, and if you have a front-loader use one eighth. Then add two tablespoons of bicarb soda to your washing powder or liquid and in the slot for fabric softener, put two tablespoons of white vinegar. “That formula means your clothes come out cleaner, they stay cleaner longer and they dry one third faster,” she says. Another hot tip is to skip the fabric softener because “it will damage your clothes, it is basically oil”. Generally speaking, using warm water in your washing will clean your clothes better, but it does require more energy. Lush says as a rule of thumb, water temperature at blood heat (about 37C) “is best because most fats and proteins will emulsify” at this temperature and, when combined with a washing machine’s agitation, stains will come out easily. “If you use cold water, some things come out well and some things won’t,” she says. Other things to note: be careful not to wash bloodstains in hot water because the stain will set and become very hard to get out. Use the same water temperature for washing and rinsing to prevent garments from shrinking. When washing things by hand, Lush says she uses the sink and cheap shampoo instead of laundry detergent. She dilutes “a very small amount of shampoo, just a teaspoon, in a sink of blood-heat water”. Submerge delicate garments, like silk, “rub it out and rinse in the same temperature water”. If you’re using this technique to wash woollen knits, be sure there isn’t any eucalyptus oil in the shampoo, as it will damage the fibres. Line-drying your clothes is always better than using a tumble dryer because the heat and tumbling will age your clothes. If you are going to use a tumble dryer, Lush says, “put a dry tea towel in with whatever you’re drying”. This will speed up the drying process because it spreads the water over a larger surface area. She also says it is important not to over- or underfill the dryer: underfilling places stress on your clothes and overfilling means your clothes will take longer to dry. To keep your washing machine and dryer functioning nicely, be sure to empty the filters on both after every wash. Clogged-up filters impede the machine’s ability to function and run the risk of damaging your clothes or even starting a fire. Finally, Lush says, “you should have your washing machine and dryer serviced every 15 months” and your washing machine pipes changed every two years.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Laundry 101: why cheap detergent is fine and how to decode garment care symbols,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/15/laundry-101-why-cheap-detergent-is-fine-and-how-to-decode-garment-care-symbols
3/15/2022,"Former New South Wales deputy premier John Barilaro directed millions of dollars in grants to Coalition electorates, many of them at-risk National party seats, from a discretionary pool of funds which have almost no departmental oversight. An analysis of discretionary grants handed out by Barilaro during the past three years shows that 70% of the $3m spent went to Coalition seats. Recipients have included his successor in the seat of Monaro, Nichole Overall, as well as the NRL and a soccer club where Barilaro was president for eight years. In particular, the use of discretionary funds in seats in the lead-up to elections has raised questions about how the grants operate, and a lack of oversight by government departments. In some cases, recipients said they were asked by Barilaro himself to submit funding requests to his office. In the lead up to last May’s Upper Hunter byelection, the Nationals made some $120m in funding promises as it successfully held the seat after the resignation of former MP Michael Johnsen. Among them were a series of significant announcements, including $45m for an upgrade of the Muswellbrook hospital and $12m for a police station in the town of Singleton. But the pre-election spend also included a series of grants to local organisations that were not subject to departmental advice, or recommendations. The Upper Hunter received $340,000 in grants from Barilaro in the last financial year, about a fifth of the total money distributed under a fund known as the deputy premier’s discretionary or miscellaneous fund. Among the grants were $200,000 given to the Muswellbrook Golf Club in the weeks leading up to the vote. The grant followed a separate $1m payment in 2019, and was announced by Barilaro just days before the byelection. Club president Daryl Egan told the Guardian a cost blowout meant the course needed additional funding to complete work on the project, and that he raised the prospect of securing the money while Barilaro was in town during the byelection campaign. “We were talking to the deputy premier and he asked how it was going and I told him that, yes, because of Covid and a few other things the cost had increased,” he said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Egan said he was asked to write a letter explaining the need for the additional funding and that it had been secured “within a few weeks”. The funding was not without any requirements – Egan said that after the money was provided the club was required to provide evidence to the department showing what it had been spent on – but did not require a formal grant application. Similarly, in the weeks leading up to the vote Barilaro announced a $100,000 grant to a local networking organisation called Upper Hunter Women in Business. The funds were to be delivered over two separate years. The group’s founder, Lavinia Hutchinson, did not respond to a request for comment, but in April when the grant was awarded she told a local news site that Barilaro had offered the group funding in the lead up to the byelection. “We got a phone call today from John basically asking if we would like some funding … he said ‘how’s $100,000 sound?’,” Hutchinson said at the time. Barilaro was quoted in the same report saying: “This is not an election commitment, regardless of the election it is me as deputy premier supporting what I believe is a very worthy organisation.” Barilaro did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment. Labor’s shadow treasurer, Daniel Mookhey, accused the Nationals of doing “their best Santa Claus impression” during the byelection. “They gave what they want, to whom they wanted, whenever they wanted to,” he said. “Other communities missed out as the government doled on public funds to save their skins in a tightly fought byelection.” That pattern has been repeated elsewhere. At the previous state election in 2019 the Nationals party was fighting to hold on to a series of seats including Lismore, Barwon and Murray, while also hoping to win back Ballina, which it lost to the Greens in 2015. Of the almost $870,000 in total grants awarded by Barilaro during that year, about a fifth went to those four seats. They included a $26,000 grant to a gym in the seat of Murray two weeks before the election, as well as a series of larger grants to local councils. In Ballina, a $25,700 grant for the Lennox Head Surf Club was announced four months before the 2019 election by Nationals’ candidate in the seat Ben Franklin. Of the rest of the funds distributed that year, only two grants valued at $35,000 went to organisations based in non-government seats, although some were directed to larger organisations not based in a particular electorate. The NSW government has faced repeated controversy over its use of grant funding in recent years. In February the auditor general released a scathing report into a $252m grant scheme which directed more than 95% of funds to local councils in government seats. The fund, the auditor found, “lacked integrity” and did not use any consistent guidelines in awarding grants. But unlike those programs, the deputy premier’s discretionary grants aren’t subject to vetting, and government departments don’t make formal recommendations about the benefits of the funding. Instead, as the name suggests, the grants are entirely at the discretion of the minister. In March last year, Chris Hanger, a senior official in the Department of Regional NSW, told a parliamentary inquiry that approvals for money from the discretionary grant pool only require an email from a ministerial adviser to gain signoff.

Designed to allow the deputy premier to fund “small-scale” community projects that would otherwise struggle to gain financial support, some of the money has also been directed to larger private organisations. Last year, one of the largest grants handed out under the fund was $50,000 given to the NRL to help fund the multi-billion dollar code’s “roads to regions” program. The program, according to a spokesperson for current deputy premier Paul Toole, was aimed at allowing former NRL stars and NRLW players to travel to regional areas to run “educational programs in schools, visit junior rugby league clubs and take part in local community events”. According to the NRL, though, the program’s aim was to “support and empower rugby league communities where no NRL club engagement is present” in order to “grow the game” not only in NSW but also Queensland, Victoria and South Australia. It was the second time the program had received funds from the deputy premier. In 2018, Barilaro directed another $40,000 to the NRL for the same purpose. Last year another $130,000 was given separately to the league under the government’s drought stimulus fund. That funding, which Barilaro also oversaw, was allocated to play a match in Tamworth to “bolster community morale and support drought recovery”. The government refused to answer repeated questions about how grants are chosen under the scheme, and how potential applicants are informed about the availability of discretionary grant funds. But other grants have also raised eyebrows. In 2018, Barilaro awarded $5,000 to Nichole Overall, a Queanbeyan-based journalist and author, to support a local art installation. Overall, whose husband, Tim Overall, was until recently mayor of Queanbeyan and once sat on the council with Barilaro, replaced him as the Monaro state MP at last month’s byelection. She did not respond to a request for comment. Overall did not respond to a request for comment. Barilaro also handed two grants to the Monaro Panthers, a football club where he was president for eight years prior to his election to parliament. The two grants – for $30,000 in 2018/19 and $10,000 in 2020/21 – went to upgrades to toilets, stadium seating, and female dressing rooms at the club, as well as support for a youth football tournament. It followed $78,000 in funds he allocated the club under the now defunct Community Building Partnerships in 2013 prior to becoming Nationals leader. At the time, Barilaro faced criticism for his failure to declare a conflict of interest over the grant, which he dismissed because he was not an office bearer at the club when the money was awarded. Discretionary funds aren’t new. The premier has his own fund which has existed since 1998, and money allocated from it has fluctuated significantly in that time. In 2010/11, during the final year of the former Labor government, $14.2m was signed off on from the fund. It was only after Barry O’Farrell’s election in 2011 that money from the fund was made consistent at $2.3m per annum.",News/Australia news,"‘How’s $100,000 sound?’: John Barilaro directed grants to marginal seats",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/15/hows-100000-sound-john-barilaro-directed-grants-to-marginal-seats
3/15/2022,"New South Wales Labor leader Chris Minns says his party will commit to independent funding for the state’s anti-corruption watchdog, amid long-running concern that the integrity agency is overly reliant on the political parties it is tasked with investigating. On Tuesday, Labor will announce it will adopt a series of recommendations to make funding for the Independent Commission Against Corruption at arm’s length from the government by tasking a parliamentary committee with making recommendations on its annual budget. The policy, which also includes the allocation of contingency funds for the agency to cover “unexpected matters”, follows a series of recommendations from both the Icac and the NSW auditor general that sought changes to its funding model. It comes as the Icac has found itself the subject of fierce criticism from figures in both the state and federal governments, after its investigation into the former NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian prompted her resignation last year. Minns told Guardian Australia a Labor government would appoint a standing committee to make recommendations about the Icac’s annual budget, as well as commit to public reporting by the executive in cases where “the committee recommendation and the budget allocation are not the same”. Labor would also set aside a contingency fund of an additional 25% of yearly funding “for access by the Icac for unexpected matters arising that require urgent attention”, he said. The announcement also comes less than a month after the Icac found former NSW Labor MP Ernest Wong engaged in corrupt conduct by concealing illegal political donations from a Chinese property developer in 2015. But Minns, who previously called on the party faithful to support the Icac’s Operation Aero probe into whether Chinese Friends of Labor members and donors evaded NSW donation laws, said investigations into his own party’s practices made independent funding for the agency more important. “NSW Labor supports Icac not because it investigates our opponents, but because it investigates us,” he said. “The work of the Icac is essential to public accountability in this state. Knowing the Icac is watching helps people have faith and trust in their government and political leaders. “Integrity in politics cannot be a matter for debate, and the body that oversees this integrity cannot risk having their funding held over their heads by the very people they hold accountable.” The funding of the Icac and other key integrity agencies in NSW has been the subject of ongoing concern for several years. Despite warnings from the NSW auditor general and the high-profile Sydney barrister Bret Walker SC that the commission’s funding model risked undermining the integrity body’s independence, the government has yet to move on proposed funding changes. The Icac itself has raised similar concerns, arguing the process of funding it through a mix of appropriation and grant money was both “inconsistent with the commission’s independence and unlawful”. In February, the premier, Dominic Perrottet, told parliament he had met with the heads of the integrity agencies, saying he was committed to ensuring that they “have appropriate funding to continue the important work they do”. He said the government would announce changes to the funding models before the next budget. “I believe the proposal that we will put in place will adequately address the concerns that the individual agencies have raised,” he said. But the Icac has been subject to criticism from within his own government. During the same parliamentary question time last month, the deputy Liberal Party leader, Stuart Ayres, was picked up by microphones saying the government would commit to an independent funding model for the Icac “when they stop wasting our money”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Questioned in a budget estimates hearing last week, Ayres did not walk away from the comments, saying he was “highly critical” of “some of the timing around those investigations” – including Operation Keppel, which led to Berejiklian’s resignation. Asked whether he stood by the comments, Ayres, who was a witness in that public inquiry, said: “I gave evidence in the public hearing very clearly that I did not believe that Gladys Berejiklian had breached any code of conduct inquiry.” “I thought it was a travesty that the Icac delayed its inquiry, quite clearly, into its investigation into the allocation of funds to the ALP, and that it recently – in fact, subsequent to those comments that were captured on the microphone – has released that outcome,” he said.",News/Australia news,"Icac funding to be ‘at arm's length’ under Labor, Chris Minns reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/15/icac-funding-to-be-at-arms-length-under-nsw-labor-chris-minns-reveals
3/15/2022,"Sitting in the Victorian parliament, amid the rowdiness of question time, opposition leader Matthew Guy found himself distracted by events unfolding on the other side of the world. Russia had just begun its full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the 48-year-old’s phone was lighting up with messages from his second cousin, who lives near Kharkiv, the country’s second largest city. “His wife was about to give birth. And they were saying, ‘What do you think? Should we go in [to Kharkiv]?’” Guy tells Guardian Australia during an exclusive interview to mark the launch of our new Victorian state news section. “I said, ‘You can’t go into the city because you’ll never get back out.’” It was only after encouragement from the member for Kew, Tim Smith, that Guy addressed the lower house on the situation. “I wasn’t going to do that. But one of my colleagues said, ‘Now that war has commenced, you should get up and say something’ … I thought, he’s right, now is the right time,” he said. It led to a rare moment of bipartisanship for Victoria’s 59th parliament, with the premier, Daniel Andrews, thanking Guy for raising the issue. Days later, the opposition leader’s second cousin welcomed a baby girl. “She was born to the sound of bombs going off.” Colleagues hope the positive response to Guy letting his guard down encourages their leader to speak from the heart more regularly in future. “This is the Matthew Victorians need to see more of,” one Liberal MP said. “Political leaders who share their vulnerability in modern politics should be rewarded.” Guy has been a fixture in Victorian politics for more than a decade, leading the Coalition to an election loss in 2018, but several of his colleagues say voters are only now starting to see the real Matthew (he doesn’t go by Matt). Guy’s maternal grandparents, Ivan and Maree, fled Ukraine – then part of Stalin’s Soviet Union – during the second world war, for Germany. His aunt, born in 1944, died when the Nazis wouldn’t allow her medicine. His mother, Vera, was born in 1946, three years before the family made its way to Australia. Guy’s childhood, however, was “quintessentially Australian”. He rode his bike up and down the hills of Montmorency, in Melbourne’s north-east, played street cricket with neighbours and attended a public primary and secondary school. Mum worked at ANZ, Dad in radio and the commonwealth public service. Like most migrant kids, Guy would spend part of the school holidays at his grandmother’s each year, where she taught him Ukrainian and told him stories of what life was like under both communist and Nazi rule. She told him about famine. Air raids. Dead bodies. Coming to Australia with nothing. Stuffing towels down the holes in the floor at Bonegilla migrant camp to stop the snakes from getting in. “It’s not an uncommon story,” he says, although he admits it has shaped his worldview. “So it makes me angry when I see people talk down this country.” Who does that, exactly? “The left likes to make out Australia as a nasty and intolerant country,” Guy says. “It is not. Canada, Australia and Argentina have welcomed more migrants per capita than anywhere else in the world.” “I don’t think Australians are inherently racist. I think Australians are actually inherently nice, decent people.” Guy says people who come to Australia and work hard do well, and it’seasy to see why he’s a firm believer in meritocracy when you consider his rise through the Liberal party, despite not coming through the usual channels of private school and privilege. He joined the party at 16, in the dying days of the Cain-Kirner government, because he was sick of the Labor party “taking advantage” of hard-working families like his. Within a couple of years he was working in premier Jeff Kennett’s office as a researcher. He soon headed that team. Following the 1999 election loss, he became chief of staff to the then opposition leader, Denis Napthine. It was in Napthine’s office that Guy met his wife, Renae. They have three sons and live in Templestowe, about a 20-minute drive from where Guy grew up. Having been elected an MP at age 32, he was minister for planning by 36 and opposition leader at 40. But Guy’s spectacular rise came with a crushing fall. The 2018 election saw the Coalition shed 10 of its 37 lower house seats, including the blue-ribbon seat of Hawthorn. Guy resigned as opposition leader days later and was replaced by Michael O’Brien. An internal review into the loss found the ousting of Malcolm Turnbull as federal party leader had a major impact but it was also scathing of the party’s law and order led strategy and focus on “African gangs”. Voters saw it as a political tactic rather than a plan to make the state safer – research found it only influenced 6% of people’s vote, and not necessarily in the Coalition’s favour. But Guy maintains he “never mentioned African gangs” during the campaign and instead blames Labor and the federal government for focusing on the issue. When it’s put to him that members of his frontbench, including Smith and the then member for Hawthorn, John Pesutto, singled out African people, Guy replies: “Our policy never ever mentioned the words ‘African gangs’, because many of the gangs we were talking about were not African. “Many in the left, in the Labor party and the Age, like to rewrite history. But that is not what we talked about. “At every single press conference I said that the policy should apply to everyone whether they’ve been here one month or their family’s been here 100 years.” Asked whether the issue would be resurrected during this year’s election campaign, Guy replies: “It’s not 2018.”” When he returned to the leadership in September Guy promised Victorians a “positive agenda” and “hope” for the future following repeated Covid-19 lockdowns. Last month, he released a 44-page document outlining key principles, including a commitment to no longer impose lockdowns, fixing the state’s healthcare and mental health “crisis” and slashing hospital waiting lists, keeping schools open, cutting the cost of living, and supporting businesses to recover and to employ more people. He said the initiatives would be funded by reining in over-spending on the government’s infrastructure projects. Guy appears comfortable that he has struck the right balance between the opposing sides of his party. He has opposed a mandate for Covid-19 booster shots but has ruled out any changes to new laws banning gay conversion therapy and supports the government’s plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030. He’s also brought back O’Brien to the frontbench as shadow attorney general, and maintains there’s a place for controversial MP Bernie Finn in the party, despite reports aspirants are lining up to challenge him for the number one position on the Western Metropolitan upper house ticket. He describes Finn, who has campaigned against abortion reform, same-sex marriage and voluntary assisted dying laws, expressed support for Donald Trump and the rioters who stormed the US Capitol building, opposes Covid-19 vaccination mandates and attended anti-government protests, as a “very loud and proud conservative”. “Just because most of the mainstream media don’t like his views, that doesn’t mean that people who have his views shouldn’t have a place in parliament,” he says. “We’ve got people from the conservatives and small-l Liberals in the same room, representing different constituencies in Victoria, with different points of view on topics but [who] can come to an agreement at the end of the day.”” Certainly his colleagues seem happy with the direction Guy has taken. Liberal MPs tell Guardian Australia that he has learned from 2018, having been “humbled by the experience”. For the first time in years, they say, the party is united, focused and in a competitive position. “He’s grown up a lot in the last four years,” one says.",News/Australia news,‘It’s not 2018’: Matthew Guy learns to open up and unite his party,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/15/its-not-2018-matthew-guy-learns-to-open-up-and-unite-his-party
3/15/2022,"The New South Wales education department says it is not planning to reintroduce masks in schools ahead of the general community, despite Covid case numbers spiralling in children and educators admitting learning is suffering. NSW Association of Catholic Principals president, Michael Egan, said running schools like “normal” had already become impossible as case numbers surged. “It’s not running normally, if you take it normally to be that a class has a competently trained teacher in that area in front of them. That’s just not happening,” he said. “We’re providing large amounts of supervision rather than actual teaching. Subjects with a practical component, they just aren’t happening. You can’t have the casual teacher come in and do a science experiment with kids.” Covid cases in under 20s have risen sharply – accounting for almost 29,000 of the 66,000 of total cases in the week ending 5 March – with fears the BA.2 Omicron subvariant could further accelerate transmission. Teens were the highest represented age group, with almost 18,000 testing positive over the week – up from 12,000 the week before. Teachers and students in NSW had been required to do two rapid tests a week at the start of term, alongside the separation of year levels to minimise socialising and indoor mask-wearing. President of the NSW Teachers Federation, Angelo Gavrielatos, criticised the government for removing mitigation strategies too quickly and said health advice “should prevail”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “It’s putting incredible pressure on our schools because it’s impacting absentee rates, not only of kids but of teachers. “There should have been a steady graduated lifting of the risk mitigation strategies in order to monitor how each mitigation strategy was impacting our schools.” The education department said it was auditing the number of rapid tests it had on hand in case surveillance testing was reintroduced. But the department confirmed it would not reintroduce mask mandates in schools, unless the measure was reintroduced for the general public. “Should the broader community settings for indoor mask-wearing change, we will continue to work closely with NSW Health to develop appropriate measures.” The state’s health minister, Brad Hazzard, has repeatedly stated reintroducing lockdowns and other infection control measures was not his preference, instead encouraging people to get their boosters. “Everybody is over it, putting it bluntly,” he said on Monday morning. Hazzard said it was an absolute necessity for people to get the booster as soon as they could, with about 2 million eligible residents still yet to receive a third dose. “That is the big problem,” Hazzard said. He said it was likely the rate of infection would increase and more people would die. “But we have to balance mental health issues, the economic issues, young people having their cognitive development, being able to go to school, all of the things which have been so destructive for two years,” he said. However, Egan said he was still worried about the impact of Covid on the longer-term educational outcomes of students thanks to rising absenteeism and the lack of trained teachers.",News/Australia news,NSW education officials unmoved on return of masks in schools despite surging Covid infections,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/15/nsw-education-officials-unmoved-on-return-of-masks-in-schools-despite-surging-covid-infections
3/15/2022,"Conservationists have scooped up the last commercial-fishing licence of its type in the northern Great Barrier Reef, paving the way to create a “net-free zone” the size of Tasmania to protect dugongs, dolphins and turtles. WWF-Australia announced on Monday it had bought and would retire Tony Riesenweber’s commercial “gill net” licence – which held the “last sizeable quota” for the northern reef – effectively creating a 100,000 sq km refuge stretching from Cape Flattery through to the Torres Strait. Richard Leck, the head of oceans for WWF-Australia, said it was now time for the state and federal governments to make commercial gill netting on the northern Great Barrier Reef “forever prohibited”. “By purchasing gill net licences WWF has done the heavy lifting,” he said. “Creating one of the largest safe havens for dugongs in the world is a globally significant initiative. “Now we’re calling on the Australian and Queensland governments to create a special management area over the Reef’s far north to permanently protect this area from commercial gill net fishing.” This came after WWF launched its vision for a “Net Free North” after buying another of the region’s commercial gill net licences in 2018. Leck said marine turtles, snubfin dolphins, sawfish, hammerhead sharks and the critically endangered Bizant River shark would now also be protected. He also called for an expanded network of net-free zones along the length of the Great Barrier Reef’s coasts. Though the licences WWF has bought would “never be used for commercial gill net fishing again”, it hoped to hand them over to traditional owners on the Cape for “sustainable fishing” practices such as line or mud crabbing, or to generate income from charters. The organisation is understood to have paid Riesenweber an amount at the lower end of six figures for his licence. Riesenweber mainly sought to catch barramundi with the gill net, which he said he used on or around river mouths and areas with muddy or sandy bottoms. The fisher described the WFF’s offer as a rare case of “someone outside doing something positive” for an industry which he said had been abandoned by the government. “They are trying to stand with the industry, in a lot of respects,” Riesenweber said of WWF. “So at least some fishermen can get out with a bit of dignity.” Conservationists describe gill nets as “walls of death”, but Riesenweber disputed the characterisation of them as indiscriminate killers. He said commercial operators had a vested interest in sustainable fishing, but described selling his licence as “a compromise”. “They wanted it, they had a good reason for it and they gave me an offer that I considered reasonable,” he said. “We all want the same result at the end of day … what we gotta do is understand everyone’s point of view. “You never trust your enemy, but you can understand them.” The 68-year-old said he would continue to commercially line fish on the outer reefs, but was concerned about rising fuel prices and seafood imports. Riesenweber said his grandfather had fished Moreton Bay and his dad had died on a trawler in 1971. “When I retire I want to be able to buy fresh Australian fish,” he said. “But the way we are heading is we won’t be able to do that.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Leck said WWF supported sustainable fishing on the reef – commercial and recreational. “It’s just unfortunate that still, within the World Heritage area, we have a number of poor fishing practices and a lot of room for improvement of fisheries management,” Leck said. Riesenweber’s is the fourth gill net licence bought by WWF on the reef. Two were bought primarily to protect dugongs, two others for hammerhead sharks. “It’s not normal practice for a conservation organisation to buy and shelve commercial net fishing licences,” Leck said. “But it was a practical way to remove the threat of gill nets from a section of the reef [that is] incredibly important for threatened species.” WWF has focused on the northern section of the reef as it has the highest proportion of threatened marine wildlife, with the area north of Cape Flattery home to about 7,000 dugongs and 282,000 large juvenile and adult turtles. Leck said there was no formal recording of the entanglement and drowning of threatened marine species in nets. But WWF points to recent marine deaths they say demonstrate the dangers of gill nets. In September 2018, six sawfish and two dugongs washed up on a beach south of Townsville. All were believed killed by gill nets. “Australia’s nature needs us now more than ever,” Leck said.",News/Environment,WWF buys fishing licence to create a Tasmania-sized ‘net-free zone’ in Great Barrier Reef,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/15/conservationists-buy-fishing-licence-to-create-tasmania-sized-net-free-zone
3/15/2022,"In 2017, the Indigenous elder George Gorringe led a small research expedition in the Channel Country of south-west Queensland. The expedition, on the traditional land of the Mithaka people, visited several sites including sandstone quarries, stone arrangements, and the remains of gunyahs – dwellings made from excavated structures covered with branches. The region is archaeologically significant: the landscape has been dramatically altered by a huge network of quarries, which Mithaka people once used to make seed-grinding implements. “George Gorringe showed me some really monumental sites,” recalls Dr Michael Westaway of the University of Queensland. “The scale of them is just mind-blowing.” A team involving traditional owners and researchers eventually identified 179 quarry sites, spread over 33,800 sq km – an area about half the size of Tasmania. Some quarry pits are estimated to be more than 2,000 years old. In December, Westaway and collaborators received grant funding to investigate plant domestication and possible village sites on Mithaka land. The research seeks to determine how best to “define traditional Aboriginal food production and settlement systems”. The project, Westaway says, will test the Dark Emu hypothesis: the idea, propounded by Bruce Pascoe in his bestselling book, that Indigenous people in pre-colonial Australia were not hunter-gatherers, but practised agriculture. Pascoe’s book has been praised for challenging assumptions about Indigenous Australia, but also criticised by academics for distorting evidence and implying that agricultural societies are more advanced than hunter-gatherers. The definition of agriculture is closely linked to domestication, Westaway says. There are historical accounts of flood-driven irrigation systems and plant cultivation on Mithaka land, and the team plans to analyse pollen samples for genetic evidence of plant domestication or translocation. “If people are manipulating plants and the environments they live in, it is likely that they’ll have some kind of impact on the evolutionary trajectory of those plants,” Westaway says. “It’s a really important step towards testing these ideas that Bruce [Pascoe] was putting forward.” But Westaway also believes binary labelling does not adequately reflect the diversity of Indigenous food production systems. “We need to move away, I think, from these terms – hunter-gatherer and agriculturalist – because it doesn’t capture that complexity,” he says. The Channel Country is so named for its intertwined channels, which monsoonal rains transform from arid desert into lush greenery. A complex exchange system once operated up and down along these rivulets. Mithaka land was once at the heart of a vast transcontinental exchange route that spanned from the Gulf of Carpentaria in the north, down to the Flinders Ranges in South Australia – a system Westaway describes as “Australia’s Silk Road”. “It connected large numbers of Aboriginal groups throughout that arid interior area on the eastern margins of the Simpson Desert,” he says. “You get people interacting all across the continent, exchanging ideas, trading objects and items and ceremonies and songs.” Grindstones mined and produced on an industrial scale on Mithaka land were exchanged for ochre, wooden objects, stone axes, and pituri, a narcotic. “We don’t really know how far and wide they were being distributed, but they were an important element,” Westaway says. Prof Rachel Popelka-Filcoff, an archaeologist at the University of Melbourne, who was not involved in the project, says the research adds “data to the fact that there was significant exchange in the archaeological record of these different materials”. “[Indigenous] people may have had stories and traditions about [these exchange networks] and this is just additional evidence for these interactions.” One of the sites comprises 25,000 individual quarry pits, says Shawnee Gorringe, a Mithaka traditional owner. She describes the archaeological research findings as “scientific validation of something that you already knew was pretty special.” Artefacts from several key quarry sites are included in a new exhibition – Kirrenderri, Heart of the Channel Country – which opened last Friday at the University of Queensland Anthropology Museum. The exhibition draws together research and ethnohistorical accounts documented in contemporaneous books written by Alice Duncan-Kemp, says Tracey Hough, a director of the Mithaka Aboriginal Corporation, who, along with Shawnee Gorringe, is an Indigenous co-curator of the exhibition. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The collaboration has been a means of “rediscovering our own past”, Hough says. “Through colonisation we lost a lot of information – a lot of our ceremonies, our language … As we dig deeper into our interior, we’re finding so many artefacts, we’re finding information.” Craig Crawford, Queensland minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander partnerships, was astounded by the scale of the Mithaka quarries when he flew over the region. “The mining operations were extensive – you could even see ones where there had been exploratory digs,” he says. “Anyone that wants to question the sophistication of the networks that First Australians had – I think this challenges it to its core.” For Hough, the discovery of large-scale mining raises other questions: “That’s manpower – you’ve got to feed all those people [excavating the quarries]. So where is all your food coming from?” She is excited by the Dark Emu research project. “They’re looking at different grains … and seeing if they have been altered by human interaction,” she says. “It’s a great thing for Australian history.”",News/Australia news,"Quarries, trade and Dark Emu: unearthing treasures from ‘Australia’s Silk Road’",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/15/quarries-trade-and-dark-emu-unearthing-treasures-from-australias-silk-road
3/15/2022,"Playing the Port Fairy folk festival on 6 March 2010 is something I can’t forget. It was the day after we buried Ruby [Hunter, Roach’s life and music partner of 35 years]. We were driving back from Berri in the South Australian Riverland and people from the festival got in touch with me, letting me know they understood if I didn’t want to perform. Well, I thought about it and thought about it, and for some reason – I don’t know if Ruby was talking to me – I felt like I had to do the show, to honour her memory. So I said to the crowd in the tent: “If ever there was ever a time that I needed you, I need you more today than I ever have.” Somebody yelled out in the crowd, “You got us, brother.” Shane Howard [from folk rock group Goanna] and a lot of other musicians were sitting to the side of stage, too. Every now and again I looked towards them. That was a big comfort – they gave me a lot of strength. My son Amos played bass that day. I said to Amos, “You don’t have to get up if you don’t want to, Son.” He said, “No, I want to get up with you Dad, I have to do it for Mum.” We got through it; I don’t know how. It wasn’t easy, it was a pretty emotional show. I think Ruby had a hand in there somewhere. I don’t think about it that much, but when I do I’m amazed at how it happened. It was very surreal – it felt like I wasn’t even there, even though I was talking to the audience and playing as I usually do. But I felt safe, I think, being at home on country [Port Fairy is on Gunditjmara land in south-western Victoria, where Roach’s mother was born, and where he now resides]. Afterwards there was a feeling of release. The festival MC Derek Guille said to me, “Thanks for doing this Archie.” I said, “Don’t thank me Derek, I had to do it, for Ruby.” He just broke down on my shoulder. He said: “We all need to grieve Ruby’s loss, Archie.” I understood what she meant to a lot of people that day. They were listening to me, but they were grieving Ruby too. That day I realised the importance of the people that I sing to, and tell yarns to on stage. They’re more than just people who come and listen to me sing songs. I needed them, and they gave me something back, that’s for sure. Archie Roach is touring Australia now. His 44-track anthology, My Songs: 1989 – 2021, is out now.

3/15/2022,"In September last year, the mayor of Perth floated the idea of a minute’s ovation for those penned in their houses on the other side of the country. It was a nice enough thought, but it went down like a lead balloon. Melburnians, in particular, were in no mood for stunts like that. The city was at breaking point. At the Shrine of Remembrance, protesters pelted police with golf balls. A few hundred metres from the MCG, newspaper photographers were capsicum sprayed. A magnitude 5.9 earthquake tipped everyone off their axis a little bit more. Most people, especially those schooling their kids at home, remember it as the worst period of the pandemic. On grand final day, people donned their colours and blundered about like lost dogs. The pubs were padlocked. Online, people were falling to pieces at the prospect of a late twilight start. Wayne Carey, always a popular figure on Twitter, was trending. A ‘social commentator’ was questioning why this country obsesses over sport. Mike Brady was shambling around deserted Melbourne streets and laneways, carting an enormous guitar and belting out his song to an empty MCG. It really rubbed it in. After the soul rotting games with no crowds, there was something almost confronting about seeing a heaving stadium. Those lucky, isolated, Covid-free pricks. Despite the blowout, it was one of the more memorable grand finals. More than most years, it was a grand final for supporters – many with cameras trained on them, some with dad’s ashes perched prominently, all in various states of agitation and disbelief. Melbourne fans had been subjected to more turgid football than any other supporter base. When their premiership finally came, it was on the other side of Australia, in another time zone. For Melburnians, it may as well have been played on Pluto. Only former champions and border hoppers got to see it in the flesh. It cost Garry Lyon two weeks of hard quarantine. It cost the other two blokes their liberty. They could count themselves a little stiff. The selfies didn’t help. The judge was pitiless. But sympathy for the pair was scant. They presented as two men who’d been handed some pretty good cards in life, apart from a competent football team. They were gifted half an hour of almost perfect football, and a summer in the slammer. Five months on, and by footy’s standards, it’s been a remarkably low-key off season. Jordan De Goey was arrested in his dressing gown. Simon Goodwin was front page news for half a week after he had a beer with his captain. Apart from that, the scandals have belonged to cricket and tennis. A captain sending a picture of his dick to a colleague? Footy, and certainly rugby league, used to have a mortgage on that stuff. But there really aren’t the scandals there used to be – no knocked-up schoolgirls, no bar patrons being glassed or urinated on, no half forward flankers skolling bottles of sunscreen. Last year, life could flip in half an hour. You were one interstate furniture removalist away from crowd-less games, from closed borders and from curfews. Suddenly your team was on the tarmac, and you were on Twitter bickering with 13-year-old Tories and retired social studies teachers. This year, the AFL is pushing the “business as usual” angle. But there’s still an underlying anxiety. Covid has decimated the AFLW season. Most of the clubs are still living on a thin line. There are going to be a lot of mass omissions, ring ins and mental health challenges. Local clubs are going under. There’s a severe staff shortage at the MCG. And the city is still processing the loss of its most famous sportsperson. When news of Shane Warne’s death started coming through, Melbourne was being pounded by rain. It sounded like we were under attack from the Luftwaffe. In the middle of the night, Wayne Ludbey took his camera to the MCG and captured an extraordinary image of Warne’s statue outside the Melbourne Cricket Club. It lacks the menace of the Dennis Lillee or Leigh Matthews statues. But it’s one of the better ones on the MCG concourse. The temptation may have been to immortalise the humble Warne, the curiously deferential Warne, the Warne with the ball raised to the crowd. Instead, it captures him mid delivery. It was a delivery stride, Gideon Haigh once wrote, that was “decisive but nonchalant, like somebody sliding up to whisper sedition in your ear”. It’s nearly 30 years since Warne played his first Test at the MCG. At the toss, the West Indian captain looked up at the new Great Southern Stand and marvelled that the ground held more people than the population of his country. At the time, I thought Keith Arthurton was the coolest man on the planet. He swaggered to the crease like Dermott Brereton walking into a nightclub. In the first innings, he clobbered Warne from one corner of the MCG to the other. In the second, he danced down the wicket and tried to hit him into the Yarra. He was floundering. He was stumped. He was never the same again. Warne, meanwhile, went solar. AFL footballers are big in this part of Australia. Warne’s fame, and his affinity with the MCG, was something else altogether. Wayne Carey, Dustin Martin and Lance Franklin could have the MCG shaking. But even in full flight, they were still somehow dwarfed by the stadium. Only Warne, by sheer force of personality and talent, seemed equal to it. Only Warne could have drawn locals – in the middle of the night, and in teeming rain – to pay tribute. There’s something unknowable about many of our great footballers. They’re mostly at arm’s length. But Warne was an open book. To Melburnians in particular, he was instantly familiar – his obsession with football, the way he dressed, the cadences of his sentences, his opinions on everything. On Wednesday night, for the first time in two years, the MCG will be at full capacity. Mayor Zempilas never got his minute’s ovation. Instead, we’ll have a minute’s silence. A sporting crowd that embraced, forgave and fuelled Warne will pause and bow. Some of the best footballers of our generation, in the prime of their lives, will possibly contemplate their own fame, their own talent, their own youth. They may contemplate how fleeting it all is, and how easily it can be ripped away.",Sport/Sport,AFL pushes ‘business as usual’ but not before Melbourne pauses to honour one of its icons | ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/15/afl-pushes-business-as-usual-but-not-before-melbourne-pauses-to-honour-one-of-its-icons
3/15/2022,"The Christchurch massacre triggered a surge of hate towards Muslim people in Australia, with women the vast majority of victims, a report has found. The Islamophobia Register Australia (IRA) recorded a fourfold increase in reports of in person incidents of anti-Muslim hate, while reports of online incidents were 18 times higher in the two weeks after 15 March 2019, when an Australian white supremacist, Brenton Tarrant, murdered 51 people in an attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. The third report of its kind, Islamophobia in Australia III draws on verified incidents of anti-Muslim hate in Australia in 2018 and 2019. Incidents recorded include that of a patient in the chair of a Muslim dentist calling all Muslims “terrorists”, a family physically assaulting a woman at the zoo, and a pregnant woman being punched repeatedly by a stranger in a cafe – a case that made news at the time. Released on Tuesday by Charles Sturt University and the Islamic Science and Research Academy, the latest report analyses 247 incidents of Islamophobia across 2018 and 2019, 138 of which occurred in person, 109 online. Anti-Muslim hate is deeply gendered, the data shows, with women comprising 82% of in-person victims – up from ​​72% in the second report and 68% in the first. Of those women, 85% were wearing hijab and 48% were alone when the attacks occurred, while 15% of them were accompanied by children. Most of the perpetrators – 74% – were male. Security guards or cameras did not make Muslims any safer, the data suggested, as there was “no meaningful correlation” between the existence of cameras and guards and the severity of an incident. Incidents recorded by the IRA also demonstrated that “anti-Muslim hate breaches social and professional hierarchies”. The report’s lead researcher, Dr Derya Iner, said the sample of incidents was “the tip of the iceberg”, noting that hate crime was vastly underreported internationally and the register’s ability to collect data depended on the community’s awareness of it. “We are not saying that this report represents everything in Australia, but this is a good sample to show manifestations of Islamophobia across Australia,” Iner said. Muslims were associated with terrorism or portrayed as killers in 12% of cases over the first reporting period (2014-2016), but that number has risen sharply, with 39% of incidents making that association in this most recent report. “I think this is the impact of online far-right groups. To bring people to that level of intense hate, you need to have a good excuse, and the best excuse is associating Muslims with terrorism and portraying them as killers,” Iner said, noting that this was one of the most common narratives online about Muslims after the Christchurch massacre. In the wake of Christchurch, 40% of reported online posts, mostly on Facebook, included threats to kill Muslims, with 55% of those threatening mass killing. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Of the in-person incidents, which included both verbal and physical attacks, 63% occurred in commonly frequented places like shopping centres or on public transport. “Muslims are attacked, harassed, among people in crowds. There is not enough social pressure on perpetrators to deter them, to prevent them doing it,” Iner said. “Hate culture is accommodated by silence. Bystanders are around, but silent.” Zainab Sajjad Haider, who reported an incident of Islamophobia to the register in 2019, told Guardian Australia that for every incident she reported, there would be “dozens” more that she didn’t. Haider, born in Tamworth, converted to Islam in 2015 while in her mid-20s. Now 31, she said the change in how she was treated once she embraced her faith was profound. “I’m a white Australian, but I lost my white privilege by putting on the hijab,” Haider said. Haider holds a veteran’s card, as she had been training as a recruit in the Australian Defence Force before an injury prevented her from progressing with a military career. After converting, she began carrying the veteran’s card with her whenever she left the house, “just in case someone came up to me”. “I found that was my get out of jail free card. That was my buffer. I remember once I was getting abused in a car park and I got out the card and threw it in this guy’s face like, ‘can you read?’ and he was like, ‘I’m so sorry’,” she said. “Obviously as a Muslim I don’t agree with our foreign policies any more, if I ever did,” Haidar said, noting the irony of her situation. “It’s funny because the narrative of invading Afghanistan was ‘saving the women’, but usually the people who attack you here are tradies. Generally, it’s blokes. If men experience Islamophobia, usually it’s racism first. It’s only Islamophobia first if they’re very visibly Muslim. “But with women, it’s always Islam first.” The incident Haider reported to the IRA occurred on a train in Melbourne, when a man hissed, spat at, and verbally abused her. When the man alighted the train, she reported the incident to the protective services officers at that station, only to discover the perpetrator was notorious for harassing Muslim women. “In Melbourne, it was only ever public transport where I was a target,” Haider said. “Every Anzac Day, Australia Day, I would try not to go into public – I would try not to be on public transport on those holidays that I know have a nationalism aspect, even though I’ve served in the army. I know I’m a target every time.” The report’s recommendations include social media companies taking more responsibility for online hate, political leadership in standing up against hate, and clearer legal consequences for online platforms and perpetrators. “It’s not Muslim people’s problem; it’s a society-wide problem. It can be countered by bystanders but also by systemic change,” Iner said.",News/Australia news,"Muslims in Australia experienced surge of hate after Christchurch massacre, report reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/15/muslims-in-australia-experienced-surge-of-hate-after-christchurch-massacre-report-reveals
