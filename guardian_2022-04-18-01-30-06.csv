4/18/2022,"Jacob Rees-Mogg has defended the government’s plans to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda as “almost an Easter story of redemption” after the policy was criticised as “depressing”, “distressing” and ungodly by church leaders. The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, used a scathing Easter Sunday address to say that the scheme “must stand the judgment of God – and it cannot”. “Subcontracting out our responsibilities, even to a country that seeks to do well, like Rwanda, is the opposite of the nature of God, who himself took responsibility for our failures,” he said. Welby’s intervention came as it emerged that the civil servant in charge of the Home Office said he did not have evidence to show that the plan to fly people 4,000 miles to Rwanda would act as a deterrent – and therefore could not be sure it would be a good use of public money. Rees-Mogg, the minister for Brexit opportunities, said the Church of England’s most senior clergyman “misunderstands” the policy and that it was in fact “almost an Easter story of redemption” for Rwanda. The former Commons leader said the UK was “providing an opportunity to Rwanda” and that the policy therefore “must be a good thing”. Speaking on Radio 4’s The World This Weekend programme, he said: “I think he misunderstands what the policy is trying to achieve, and that it isn’t an abandonment of responsibility. It is in fact a taking-on of a very difficult responsibility. “The problem that is being dealt with is that people are risking their lives in the hands of people traffickers to get into this country illegally. Now, it’s not the illegal bit of it, it is the encouragement of people traffickers that needs to be stopped.” He added that “90% of people coming are young men who, by coming via people traffickers, are jumping the queue for others”. “They are, in doing so, not only risking their lives but supporting organised crime. What we need to do is focus on legal routes into this country, of which there are quite a number,” he said. Welby was joined in his criticism by the archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, who described the policy as “depressing and distressing”. In an Easter Sunday sermon at York Minster, Cottrell said: “We can do better than this. We can do better than this because of what we see in Jesus Christ, the risen Christ, with a vision for our humanity where barriers are broken down, not new obstacles put in the path. “After all, there is in law no such thing as an illegal asylum seeker. It is the people who exploit them that we need to crack down on, not our sisters and brothers in their need. We don’t need to build more barriers and cower in the darkness of the shadows they create. “Do we want to continue to be known as a country that opens proper, legitimate pathways for all who flee violence, conflict and oppression, not just those from Ukraine, but also those fleeing other conflicts and the effect of climate change?”",News/UK news,"Rwanda asylum plan is ‘almost Easter story of redemption’, says Rees-Mogg",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/17/uk-asylum-seekers-plan-rwanda-jacob-rees-mogg
4/18/2022,"Those unfamiliar with Gilbert Gottfried, the comedian and actor who has died aged 67 of a rare form of muscular dystrophy, would instantly recognise his voice, shrill, high-pitched and grating. It was the voice of Iago the parrot in the movie Aladdin, or Mr Mxyzptlk, Superman’s trickster nemesis, or Kraang Subprime in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles TV series. Putting a face to the voice, they might recall his desperately conniving corrupt accountant Sid Bernstein in Beverly Hills Cop 2. While Gottfried’s voice made him a family favourite, it was also part of the character of a tasteless, often profane, stand-up comic. Only 5ft 5in (1.65 metres) tall, with a frail-seeming body and large head, performing with an exaggerated squint, his act resembled a precocious child’s tantrum: as audiences recoiled from a touchy joke, elaborated in ever more flowery language, the voice got louder, more insistent. Then he might stop to deconstruct what he was doing: “Logically, this doesn’t make sense,” he would yell, “but it’s a joke!!” His greatest fame as a comedian came in the film The Aristocrats (2005), where comics discussed and performed the eponymous dirty joke which they had for decades told each other: a detailed description of a family (and their dog) auditioning their depraved vaudeville act for an agent. When they’re finished, the agent asks what they call their act, and the father proudly replies: “The Aristocrats.” Gottfried’s telling stole the film; in fact he may have been its inspiration. In 2001, performing at a roast of the Playboy founder, Hugh Hefner, Gottfried made a joke about 9/11, which much of the audience booed, crying out: “Too soon.” To recover, he told The Aristocrats, famously winning them over. For an R-rated version of the effect, you could listen to his 2012 reading of excerpts from the novel Fifty Shades of Grey. He was born in Brooklyn, where his father, Max, ran the family’s hardware business; his mother, Lillian (nee Zimmerman), was a homemaker. His older sister, Arlene, became a successful photographer, but Gilbert started comedy early, beginning at open mic nights when he was only 15. He soon learned to aim for the last spot, where he could mimic those who had already performed. “Jerry Seinfeld would refuse to come into the room when I was doing him,” he recalled. His big break should have come in 1980, when he was hired for Saturday Night Live, but he was barely used in his 12 episodes. He was Alan Thicke’s sidekick on Thicke of the Night (1983-84), then did a special for Cinemax in 1987, which led in 1989 to nine years of hosting USA Network’s Up All Night, presenting bad B movies. From 1994, the show’s lead-in was the edgy animated sitcom Duckman, starring Jason Alexander, on which Gottfried had a recurring part. Another missed break came in 1988, when he starred in a series pilot called Norman’s Corner, written by Larry David, playing a New York newstand vendor. The offbeat series didn’t sell, but the pilot was released as a TV movie. Gottfried later joked that when David went in to pitch Seinfeld, the executives said: “Aren’t you the guy who wrote that piece of shit for Gilbert Gottfried?” He then hosted the 1991 Emmys, opening with jokes about the arrest of Paul Reubens (Pee-wee Herman) for masturbating in an adult cinema (“if masturbation were a crime, I’d be on death row. By 8.14 this morning, I was already Al Capone”). It so upset Fox that the jokes were edited out of the programme’s later, west coast feed. Gottfried’s credits are a comedy routine themselves, befitting someone nominated three times for the Golden Raspberry award for worst supporting actor of 1990 (as Johnny Crunch in The Adventures of Ford Fairlane, Joey the baby gym instructor in Look Who’s Talking Too and Mr Peabody in Problem Child, a role he repeated in its sequel). He had cameos as both Hitler in Highway to Hell (1991) and Abraham Lincoln in A Million Ways to Die in the West (2014). He played the TV reporter Ron McDonald in two Sharknado movies, then Ron’s father Rand in The Last Sharknado: It’s About Time (2018). But his best, most uncensored, work came in roasts, performed for his fellow comics, memorably including fellow bad-taste comic Bob Saget, Joan Rivers, Star Trek’s George Takei and Roseanne Barr, whom he christened Rozilla. Insiders knew where he came from. As Tom Bergeron – the host of the gameshow Hollywood Squares, on which Gottfried provided a memorable sequence when the contestants guessed wrong on his answers six consecutive times, Gottfried shouting “you fool!” each time – pointed out: “Never has such a sharp wit come from a sweeter source.” Gottfried wrote a memoir, Rubber Balls and Liquor (2011), but more revealing was the 2017 documentary Gilbert, showing his family life with his wife, Dara Kravitz, whom he met at a post-Grammys party in the 90s and married in 2007. He is survived by Dara, their children, Lily and Max, and a sister, Karen. Arlene died in 2017.

4/18/2022,"Parents now feel they can access teachers 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and have got into the habit of firing off “aggressive and accusatory” emails at any time of the day or night, a teaching conference has heard. Teachers said that since the outbreak of the pandemic, the parameters of their job have become blurred, and parents now feel they can just “jump on the phone” or go on to social media to directly contact their child’s teacher outside school hours. Responding, the head of the NASUWT teachers’ union said teachers have the right to “disconnect” at the end of the working day and called for the return of home-school agreements so that parents understand what they can – and cannot – expect from teachers. Home-school agreements were scrapped in 2016 to try to reduce bureaucracy in schools, but NASUWT general secretary Dr Patrick Roach said schools needed to reset boundaries to manage parental expectations and protect teachers from excessive demands. Many teachers have been told to download apps like ClassDojo, which link families and teachers, the annual conference of the NASUWT teachers’ conference heard on Sunday. But while such technology was useful during lockdown to keep in touch with children and families who were learning remotely, teachers now fear they are expected to be available to parents at all times. Sharon Bishop, a teacher working in Wolverhampton, told delegates the changing relationship between parents and teachers was having a detrimental effect on teachers’ mental health. “Parents of students now feel they can access teachers 24 hours a day, seven days a week,” she said. The conference was told of teachers being driven to suicide and others being driven out of the job by the pressures involved. “Working hours and parameters have been blurred since the pandemic,” Bishop said. “Parents and students have got into the habit of firing off emails 24/7 with the banal, bizarre and sometimes more worryingly, aggressive and accusatory messages.” A Scottish delegate, Kat Lord Watson, who worked in a private school during the first lockdown, described the agonising experience of teaching online, knowing that parents were “watching you and rating you on their WhatsApp groups”. She has since moved to work in higher education and was given funding to do a small-scale study on the impact of parental complaints on teacher mental health and wellbeing in which it was claimed that changing channels of communication had made complaints more pervasive and personal. “The direct line to staff has become much more rapid and the willingness to just jump on to the phone and make a complaint is definitely much more there than it ever has been,” one participant said. Others who participated in the research reported an increase in unrealistic parental requests. “You just think, really? That’s not something that you could actually ever expect of a school. It’s not reasonable to expect a school to be able to support you in that.” Speaking to the media after the debate, Roach said some schools were putting pressure on teachers to respond immediately to parental requests, even after hours, saying: “I don’t want parent X rocking up the following morning, saying ‘I emailed Mr Jones, I didn’t get a response’.” Parents are also putting pressure on teachers, he said, in some cases even asking for instant help with tricky homework. Parents are getting in touch saying, “this is urgent and I expect an immediate response”, but “parental expectations need to be properly managed”, said Roach. The general secretary used his conference speech to accuse independent schools of using “gun to the head” employment practices, threatening to fire and rehire staff in a dispute over pensions. Roach accused them of treating teachers with “contempt and intimidation”, and said if they continued there should be a rethink of tax breaks for private schools. Teachers at the GDST, a group of 23 private schools, went on strike earlier this year over their schools’ withdrawal from the Teachers’ Pension Scheme (TPS). In March, the trust said teachers would be able to stay in the TPS, but new teachers would not be allowed to join, and withdrew the threat of pursuing “fire and rehire” policies.",News/Education,Parents targeting teachers with ‘aggressive’ emails since Covid outbreak,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/17/parents-targeting-teachers-with-aggressive-emails-since-covid-outbreak
4/18/2022,"The last remaining Ukrainian troops in the besieged port city of Mariupol are still holding out, as Moscow edged closer to full control of the city in what would be its first major capture since it invaded Ukraine in February. A Russian ultimatum for Ukrainians forces to surrender passed on Sunday, as the outnumbered defenders make their last stand in the Azovstal steelworks, one of Europe’s biggest metallurgical plants with a maze of rail tracks and blast furnaces. Elsewhere on Sunday Russian forces carried out missile strikes near Kyiv in an apparent effort to weaken Ukraine’s military capacity before an anticipated assault in the east. And at least five people were killed and 13 wounded in Russian shelling of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. Under Russian control Russian invasion route Russian airstrike or shelling Russian attack or movement Ukrainian attack or movement  The world becomes increasingly concerned about more than 100,000 Russian troops that have accumulated on the Ukrainian border. Western intelligence agencies sound the alarm, though Vladimir Putin insists Russia has no plans to invade. On 22 February, Putin declared that Russia would recognise the Luhansk and Donetsk regions as independent states, after Russia-backed separatists partially seized the regions. Ukraine and the west's worst fears are realised as airstrikes hit targets across the country, as far west as Lviv. By clicking on the dots on the map, you'll reveal more information about individual strikes and events. Russian forces invade Ukraine from multiple entry points: Belarus to the north, Russia to the east and Russian-occupied Crimea to the south. Russian forces move on several points on the first day of the invasion. Several key locations, including the Chernobyl exclusion zone, are captured by the Russian army. Russian troops enter parts of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where they face strong resistance. After fierce fighting prevents them from seizing the Hostomel airbase on the first day of the invasion, progress is limited to the north-west of the capital. They are still, however, able to claim some land on the outskirts of the city. Elsewhere, fighting continues even as Russian progress slows. Russian forces move to encircle the southern city of Mariupol, although they enjoy less success in the north, where they abandon an attempt to take Chernihiv after heavy fighting. Russian forces advance on key cities including Kharkiv in the north-east, Kyiv in the north and Mariupol in the south. A large convoy of military vehicles approaches the capital, although progress is limited and logistical problems are reported. As the war enters its second week, Russia steps up shelling of civilian areas. Operations to envelop Kyiv remain the focus of Russia’s efforts, but the ISW reports three other aims: seizing Kharkiv, taking Mariupol and securing a “land bridge” in the south, and securing Kherson in order to set conditions for a drive west towards Mykolaiv and Odesa. Little progress is made over the first two weeks of March. Amid reports of lost momentum and low morale, Russian forces are consolidating positions with reinforcements and probing defences around Kyiv. Dozens of civilians are reportedly killed as Russian forces hit cities with artillery and airstrikes, seen as a new tactic in the face of limited advances on the ground. Russia is widely seen as making its best advances in the south, where Kherson becomes the first major city to fall under Russian control. On the other southern front, several buildings in Mariupol are flattened and people are left without water or power. Russia breaks ceasefires put in place to allow for evacuations from Mariupol and Volnovakha. As the conflict concludes its third week, Russia sends in reinforcements to tighten its grip around the key cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, which remain under Ukrainian control. Russian advances in the south contrast with difficulties its forces have faced in the north and north-east. Nowhere is this resistance stronger than in the increasingly fortified capital, Kyiv. Russia steps up its artillery and airstrikes on the city in an apparent attempt to degrade defending forces' capacity and morale. It is a strategy that has so far failed in other cities such as Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol. In the months before its invasion Russia had deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/russias-war-in-ukraine-complete-guide-in-maps-video-and-pictures
4/18/2022,"At the end of April, boxing history will be made. For the first time, two female fighters, Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano, will face off at New York’s legendary venue Madison Square Garden, in a fight that is predicted to supercharge the sport’s rapid rise in popularity. For two women to go 10 rounds at the same venue where Muhammad Ali fought Joe Frazier – twice – and Rocky Marciano knocked out an ageing Joe Louis shows the remarkable, rapid progress that has taken place in the past two decades. It was watching women win Olympic medals using the same blend of toughness and elan as their male counterparts, some claim, while the success of the 2004 film Million Dollar Baby gave the grit and determination of female boxers the Hollywood treatment. Whatever the reason, it is worth rememberingthe UK’s first legal women’s fight took place 23 years ago, and female boxers still experience stigma and stereotyping in male-dominated clubs. Taylor and Serrano’s fight represents a sea change: it has generated interest on a level with male fights, with pre-sale tickets for the 20,000-capacity arena selling out quickly. Women’s boxing is becoming more popular at all levels, from amateur to professional. According to a Sport England survey from 2020, 17% more women boxed regularly in 2020 than in 2015, with 420,400 women involved, while Boxing England said there has been a 65% growth in female membership since 2017, despite the pandemic. When Taylor, an Irish boxer with a UK team, began her career as a teenager in the late 1990s, she had to pretend to be a boy under the pseudonym Kay. “When I started, women’s boxing wasn’t allowed in Ireland. That was a huge barrier I had to break down. One of the best things about my journey is seeing so many female fighters now, and the opportunities that are out there,” she said. She believes her Madison Square Garden fight will “open up so many doors” for female fighters. “It’s great for young girls to grow up with female role models, that’s very important.” Taylor sees the 2012 Olympics, when women’s boxing was introduced for the first time, as a turning point, especially in Ireland and the UK. She won a gold medal for Ireland as a lightweight, while Briton Nicola Adams won gold in the bantamweight category. A new generation of boxing stars are benefiting from the platform those early champions have given the sport. This includes Shannon Courtenay, who turned professional in 2019 after crediting the discipline boxing instilled in her with turning her life around. “When I first started boxing, I was the only female in the gym. People would raise their eyebrows when I said I boxed. They were like, ‘Really? You’re a woman!’ Now I feel it’s the norm,” she said. “Women’s sport is massively growing, but especially boxing.” She thinks that although it is still perceived as a “man’s sport”, the stigma that it’s “not ladylike to fight” is disappearing. “It is about violence, but it’s also not, it’s an art form.” Eddie Hearn, who promotes Taylor alongside male superstars such as Anthony Joshua, said he had battled scepticism among old-school promoters, who warned that broadcasters would never be interested in women’s fights, but when he signed Taylor “the timing was right”. “What we’ve seen over the last six to seven years is just the most incredible rise of women’s boxing, from more and more British world champions, more female fights headlining normal cards, women’s pay increasing at an astronomical rate, and more importantly, at a grassroots level, the development of young girls saying ‘I want to become involved in boxing,’” he said. Boxers say the sport offers skills unmatched by any other activity. From intense strength and conditioning work to skill, technique and the mental rigour needed to compete. Another distinctive feature of boxing is the inclusive culture of many clubs, which are often based in low-income areas that other sports struggle to reach, said England Boxing’s club support officer Laura Sargeant. “If your parents can’t afford to pay your subs they’d rather you’d be there than on the streets, causing trouble or antisocial behaviour. It’s a hard sport and hard training,” she said. The growth in popularity of classes that combine fitness with boxing technique has also made the sport more accessible for women, some of whom go on to join clubs and compete – a route taken by British-Somali professional Ramla Ali. Gyms such as Blok, in London and Manchester, offer drop-in classes where people can learn how to spar without the risks associated with competitive fights. “People are looking to get a good hard workout in a short space of time because they have busy lives and boxing offers that, and because it’s skills-based it’s a bit more engaging, so it feels like you’re learning something,” said Blok’s head of boxing, Declan Taylor. For Taylor, her fight with Serrano isn’t the end of the journey for women’s boxing. “I want those fights to be on a consistent basis, I want big mega-fights consistently from month to month just like we’re seeing with men. I want women to become the biggest names overall.” Katie Taylor v Amanda Serrano will be aired on DAZN on 30 April",Sport/Sport,Female fighters to make boxing history at Madison Square Garden,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/17/female-fighters-to-make-boxing-history-at-madison-square-garden
4/18/2022,"Ashley Westwood signalled instantly to the bench, and the London Stadium fell silent. Several minutes letter, he departed for hospital on a stretcher, his ankle far from its natural position. It had seemed innocuous, Westwood winning the ball ahead of Nikola Vlasic. The West Ham man pulled his shirt above his face to hide the tears, Issa Diop and Craig Dawson both consoling him. As did several Burnley players, affirming the lack of malice. A freak incident, with a horrible outcome. The noise returned to the ground within minutes, but only for the small pocket of visiting fans. Jay Rodriguez headed Maxwell Cornet’s corner against the bar, Wout Weghorst nodded in the rebound. And for a time, it seemed the post-Sean Dyche era would start with an oh-so-precious victory. The interim manager Mike Jackson will rue Cornet dragging a penalty wide in first-half stoppage time. That might have spoiled the kings of Lyon’s homecoming entirely. Tomas Soucek’s late leveller ensured the points were shared. But for Nick Pope’s later acrobatics it would have been a full reversal. Credit to Burnley who just about deserved their share following a difficult few days. It had been 3,459 days since their XI was not selected by Sean Dyche. A not so good Friday marked his last day in the office, a last-gasp win against Everton deemed insufficient filling in a five-defeat sandwich. Most queried the decision. More still asked why the club waited until five days after they lost to Norwich. There’s no immediate sign of a successor either; Mike Jackson is a temporary leader. With half-a-dozen victories across brief stints at Shrewsbury and Tranmere Rovers, Jackson hardly screams firefighter. David Moyes might argue he could use some bodies. True, he has always worked with close-knit (read “too small”) squads, and yes, he made three changes. One was Lukasz Fabianksi in goal, another Aaron Creswell back from midweek suspension. Only Vlasic was a genuine rotation, and Michail Antonio is the only senior option up top. Oh to have Carlos Tevez, who took the microphone pre-match to declare “come on you Irons.” Antonio’s all-round contribution is good, but in front of goal he is shot. An early strike from the edge of the area unwittingly became a ball down the right to Ben Johnson. West Ham looked bright. A beautifully worked corner routine saw Declan Rice dart to the front post and flick to Jarrod Bowen on the edge of the area. The initial strike was blocked before Nick Pope’s palm kept the second effort out. Then Aaron Creswell almost marked his 250th league appearance for West Ham with a sweetly struck volley. James Tarkowski was – as he will be for only another handful of games – on hand to clear. Westwood’s injury midway through the half was followed by medics twice being called to attend to supporters in the stands. Fortunately, all seemed OK. Then West Ham fell behind; remarkably given their respective league positions they have done so more times (24) than Burnley (22). Less alien to them than say, a European semi-final. The deficit ought to have been doubled before the break. From a West Ham corner, Josh Brownhill – on for Westwood – sent Cornet through. A glorious touch, a jink past Fabianksi and he was felled. After 22 successful penalty conversions, what could go wrong? After a stuttering run-up, everything. Twice in two games now has Cornet been guilty of vital misses. As with the first, West Ham started the second with purpose. Soucek could not steer Manuel Lanzini’s back-post cross goalward, before Johnson found Antonio with a whipped delivery. With the defence socially distanced, the forward planted a header wide. Cue the cameras panning to Tevez. Burnley continued to carry a threat on the break, particularly through Cornet. With 63 minutes gone, he found Johnson’s blindside and squared to Rodriguez, who was wayward when he shouldn’t have been. Rice and Weghorst both received bookings for a coming-together, the former airing frustration at being behind, the latter at his side being penned in. That restriction paid off with 16 minutes left. Antonio drew a foul out wide and Lanzini crossed towards Soucek who shouldered it in. A frantic final five featured three clear chances for West Ham winners, all kept out superbly by Pope. First, he tipped Antonio’s drive over, then he got down to his right to deny Diop from the resulting corner. A minute on and Antonio bore down on goal. Surely this would be the moment? No, and Antonio has now failed to score in 13 league appearances Burnley remain three adrift of safety, West Ham five behind fourth. Their ambitions are wildly different this season, and neither side can stop.",Sport/Football,Tomas Soucek saves point for West Ham against Burnley after Westwood injury,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/17/west-ham-burnley-premier-league-match-report
4/18/2022,"On a recent Saturday in April, Muscovites strolled around GES-2, a vast new arts centre built in a disused power station steps away from the Kremlin. But guests visiting the 54,400 sq metres centre, designed by the pioneering Italian architect Renzo Piano, were faced with one hard-to-miss problem – the art was absent. “It is not the time for contemporary art when people are dying and blood is spilling. We can’t pretend as if life is normal,” said Evgeny Antufiev, a Russian artist who asked for his works to be removed from GES-2 shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. At the end of last year Vladimir Putin toured the GES-2 museum alongside Leonid Mikhelson, one of the country’s richest businessmen, who financed the multimillion dollar construction of the centre. Cameras followed Putin as he watched over the work of the Icelandic artist Ragnar Kjartansson, who inaugurated the much-anticipated GES-2 with Santa Barbara – A Living Sculpture, a theatrical piece that examined the relationship between Russia and the US. Few places now seem to epitomise Russia’s cultural decoupling from the west better than the large, empty walls of GES-2, created as Moscow’s answer to Tate Modern. “We need to end this illusion that things will get back to how they were before the war. Drinking cocktails at art openings as people are being killed feels criminal,” Antufiev said. Other Russian and foreign artists and curators, including Kjartansson, also quickly distanced themselves from GES-2 when it became clear that the museum was not going to use its platform to oppose Russia’s invasion. “After the invasion, a lot of people were asking the institution to take a more prominent stand, like institutions were writing open letters saying GES-2 and other museums should say something, but it’s really a threat to their own existence,” said Francesco Manacorda, the former artistic director of the V-A-C Foundation in Moscow that manages GES-2, who resigned shortly after the war started. “I imagine that [exhibiting anti-war works] is out of the question. You know making an anti-war statement has legal consequences,” he added. Russia’s parliament last month passed a law imposing a jail term of up to 15 years for spreading “fake” news about the military in Ukraine. Another building that will remain empty in the coming weeks is the national pavilion of Russia at the Venice Biennale. The pavilion – built just before the 1917 Russian Revolution – is traditionally a meeting place for much of Russia’s political and cultural elite, who eagerly take the trip to Venice to be seen at arguably the most prestigious exhibition in the world. Days after Russia invaded Ukraine, two Russian artists declared that they could not represent their country at the pavilion, while their Lithuanian-born curator Raimundas Malašauskas resigned. “When the war started, it became clear to us that we cannot be in Venice because it is the pavilion of the Russian Federation. And even in a sort of middle ground, like Venice, on Italian soil, it’s still subordinate to the Russian ministry of culture,” Malašauskas said. Marat Gelman, a veteran Russian art collector, said as the war would drag on only those Russian artists who openly protested the war in their art would be welcomed in Europe. “Artists should either protest the war in their work or keep quiet. I don’t believe there will be any space for compromise,” he said. In the early days of the war, when opposition to the conflict had not yet been criminalised, more than 17,000 Russians working in the arts signed an open letter demanding that the invasion should end. However, as the country launched its systematic crackdown on opposition to the war, hundreds of artists decided to leave the country. “I fled from Moscow, which has turned into Mordor. For me, personally, there were no options left – I would not be able to stay there and be silent, and given my current activities, I would not have been free for long,” said the Russian artist Antonina Baever. “The only art from Russia that is relevant now is activist, anti-war art, but they give from 15 days to 15 years for it,” Baever said, referring to the “fake news” law. For the rest of the cultural world that stayed behind, the message was made clear: fall in line. Speaking at a meeting with leading cultural figures broadcast on national television last month, Putin set the tone by saying Russia was also engaged in a cultural battle against the west, comparing the treatment of Russian culture abroad to the burning of “unwanted literature” by Nazi supporters in Germany. His message was clearly heard in Moscow. Soon after, the city’s Bolshoi Theatre announced that it would stage a series of performances in support of Russia’s “military operation” in Ukraine, with all proceeds going to the families of Russian soldiers who had died in combat. The Oleg Tabakov theatre posted the pro-war military symbol Z across the three-floor facade of its building in central Moscow. Still, some artists in the country have continued to protest against the war despite the risks. Alexandra Skochilenko, an artist from St Petersburg, was arrested last week for a daring performance in which she allegedly replaced supermarket price labels with messages protesting against Moscow’s military campaign in Ukraine. Skochilenko now faces up to 10 years in jail on charges of “discrediting” the Russian army. And on Tuesday, police raided an anti-war classical concert at a Moscow cultural centre, interrupting a performance by the pianist Alexei Lubimov, who in dramatic fashion finished playing the final bars of Schubert’s Impromptu Op 90 No 2 as two police officers took the stage. For now, the once glitzy V-A-C will serve as a startling reminder of how the war changed Moscow overnight, as its former staff continue to grapple with the demise of the ambitious art project that was meant to bring Russia closer to the west. “The staff, it’s 250 people, worked together for this huge project, and with one action all of this has been taken away. I’m still in a mourning state,” Manacorda said.",News/World news,Empty galleries and fleeing artists: Russia’s cultural uncoupling from the west,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/17/ges-2-moscow-empty-gallery-fleeing-artist-russia-cultural-uncoupling-from-west
4/18/2022,"The word “Brexit” rears its head just once in Polly Toynbee’s Panglossian assessment of Labour’s prospects (Labour has shelves of winning policies. Now the party must get people to listen, 12 April). The party’s policy, or non-policy, on Brexit is deeply cynical, deeply flawed, and liable to prove utterly disastrous at the next election. Cynical, because no one believes that it truly reflects the personal views of Keir Starmer and his shadow cabinet on our relationship to the EU. Labour canvassers such as myself, who don’t understand it, will be either unable or unwilling to defend it on the doorstep. Its stance will completely unravel if Starmer and his colleagues cannot offer coherent, agreed solutions to the many visible disasters of Brexit – NHS staffing crises, rising food prices, plummeting exports and trade, lorry queues at Dover, etc. I had high hopes of Starmer when he became leader. Facing up to Brexit realities is an instance of national interest coinciding with that of the opposition. Confronting the Tories over their Brexit lies does not mean telling voters that they were foolish or gullible to believe them. But if Labour fails to pick up these “ripe plums” at the next election, then the obvious question, to paraphrase a recent one by Starmer, is: “What is Labour for”?Derek RobinsonMatlock, Derbyshire  Polly Toynbee is correct in her assertion that “a few chosen beacons to illuminate the way” are needed if Labour is to do enough to win the next general election. The shadow cabinet is full of competent, experienced people ready for government. But we only have to look around the world to be concerned about how the centre and left is currently viewed. In France, Emmanuel Macron is facing possible defeat by the right; Imran Khan has been ousted in Pakistan, and it may not be long before the lukewarm Democrats led by Joe Biden are challenged again by a resurgent Donald Trump. Here, Boris Johnson won a significant majority and is still relatively safe despite a succession of misjudgments, indiscretions and blunders. Competent though Keir Starmer’s Labour might be, it is still stalked from within by the ghost of the failed Corbyn experiment. If Labour is to win, it must remain calm, credible and cohesive. Starmer is an experienced lawyer and knows the value of peaking at the right time. We have come too far now not to trust his judgment.Toby WoodPeterborough, Cambridgeshire  Polly Toynbee says Labour’s slogan, “On your side”, is OK. However, with its projected vote share still only about 5% above that of the Tories, the message is clearly not reaching those who will decide the next general election. After 12 years of austerity and now a cost-of-living crisis, people need to hear that there is indeed a realistic and fairer alternative, and be given hope. At every opportunity, those speaking for Labour should preface every interview with: “It doesn’t have to be like this. Labour will…”Harold MozleyYork  Polly Toynbee laments the lack of a single clear message that Labour can proclaim as a core principle and beacon of hope. How about “Fair play and decency”?Roger WoodhouseSutton Coldfield, Birmingham  Polly Toynbee’s excellent catalogue of worthy policies might be summarised by “Help Labour make life fair”.Alan BaileyLondon  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

4/18/2022,"The announcement that student loan interest rates will rise to up to 12% (13 April) is yet another government attack on opportunities for underprivileged students to access the higher education that can give them social mobility and career fulfilment. Education mandarins set admission targets for universities to embrace “widening participation” – students from poor backgrounds and often poor schools should be offered university places with lower grades to compensate for their lack of privilege. From another corner of education policy comes sustained attacks on student loans – already a significant disincentive to poorer students. Of course these changes affect all students, but will fall disproportionately on those from underprivileged backgrounds who will be fearful of lifelong debt for an intangible investment in education. I am among the privileged elite who went to university in the 1970s, with all fees paid. As my mother was a single parent earning low wages, I was also given a huge cost-of-living grant.

Good physical preparation is also a major aid. Regular hours, frequent breaks, exercise, quiet surroundings, at least one day off each week and good food make a huge contribution to exam success. In these troubled times, schools would do well to emphasise these and, if possible, offer breakfasts on exam days. Bananas, low-sugar milkshakes and oaty cereals all help to boost concentration and stave off hunger pangs.

4/18/2022,"The game had entered the fifth minute of stoppage time when Joe Willock, recently introduced as a substitute, accelerated down the left and crossed in the direction of the on-rushing Bruno Guimarães. Within seconds that deflected delivery had been headed beyond Kasper Schmeichel by Newcastle United’s £33m Brazil midfielder, simultaneously banishing any lingering relegation fears on Eddie Howe’s part. As Howe and his staff celebrated and Leicester’s Brendan Rodgers stayed rooted to the spot, apparently shell-shocked, those coaches who believe possession to be overrated had once again been vindicated. At times in the second half a slick, smart Leicester enjoyed 85% of the ball. With Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall impressing hugely in an attacking midfield role they out-passed and out-thought their hosts on a day when Howe received a reminder there is still much work to be done on Tyneside. No matter; with the excellent Guimarães on the pitch and Willock around to make an impact from the bench, Newcastle remain a real counter-attacking threat. Only three of the Leicester starting XI which won at PSV Eindhoven in last week’s Europa League Conference quarter-final retained their places but such heavy rotation failed to prevent Rodgers’ side assuming a 19th minute lead. Newcastle had started so slowly it seemed they might have over-dosed on Easter eggs and their defending was all over the place as Dewsbury-Hall directed a corner low to the near post. All that remained was for Ayoze Pérez to extend a leg and conjure a gorgeous flick which prefaced the unattended Ademola Lookman side footing beneath the diving Martin Dubravka’s body from around 10 yards. As Rodgers and his staff celebrated a goal evidently well rehearsed on the training ground, Newcastle fans sought solace by booing Pérez, a St James’ Park old boy. His former side were level before half-time. Although Schmeichel blocked an initial shot from Guimaraes after Dan Burn had flicked Jonjo Shelvey’s corner on, he let the ball slip from his grasp and, sensing opportunity, Howe’s Brazil midfielder slid in to squeeze it over the line at the second attempt. At first Schmeichel seemed to have been fouled. Jarred Gillett, the referee, duly offered him the benefit of the doubt by disallowing it but a VAR review revealed a goalkeeping error and, having studied replays on his pitch side monitor, Gillett decreed that Guimarães had scored a legitimate goal after all. With Guimarães sparkling in the hazy Easter Sunday sunshine Leicester could never quite relax. The former Lyon playmaker marries a surfeit of skill with sheer bloody minded determination and his equaliser proved emblematic of the manner in which he had dragged Newcastle back into the game. Perhaps shamed by Guimarães’s endeavours, certain teammates began waking up, ensuring Howe’s side ended the opening half on a bit of a high. Leicester’s capacity for not so much merely dominating as monopolising possession - even if they did not always do too much with it - ensured that the second half power balance swung back towards the visitors. Kelechi Iheanacho almost scored from Dewsbury Hall’s cross but Newcastle clung on long enough for Willock and Guimaraes to enjoy the final words.",Sport/Football,Newcastle all but safe after Bruno Guimarães’ late header sinks Leicester,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/17/newcastle-leicester-premier-league-match-report
4/18/2022,"Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged US president Joe Biden to visit Ukraine and reiterated that he is not willing to cede territory in the country’s east to end war with Russia, during an extended interview with CNN broadcast on Sunday. “I think he will,” Zelenskiy said in English when asked if he was aware of any plans for a US presidential visit. “But it’s his decision, of course, and [it] depends on the safety situation, of course. But I think he’s the leader of the United States and that’s why he should come here to see.” Biden told reporters on Thursday that the US would decide soon whether to send a senior official to Ukraine as a show of support, but sources suggested to Reuters the administration was considering defense secretary Lloyd Austin or Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The Zelenskiy comments came after Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a surprise visit to Kyiv last weekend. On Friday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki, said in an interview that Biden had no visit scheduled. Zelenskiy, who spoke to the news channel on Friday in an interview broadcast on Sunday, cast his attention to the looming Russian offensive in the Donbas region in the country’s east, which is likely to become a brutal and decisive phase of the war following Russia’s retreat from areas around Kyiv in the north. Zelenskiy said Ukraine will not to give up territory in the east of the country to end the war with Russia. “This is why it is very important for us to not allow them, to stand our ground, because this battle ... it can influence the course of the whole war,” Zelensky said. There are around 40,000 Ukrainian troops in the Donbas region and he acknowledged the likelihood of multiple battles spanning an unknown period of time. “I don’t trust the Russian military and Russian leadership… the fact that we fought them off and they left and they were running away from Kyiv, from the north, from Chernihiv … it doesn’t mean that if they are able to capture Donbas, they won’t come further towards Kyiv,” Zelenskiy said. Zelenskiy welcomed the $800m in additional military aide approved by the White House last week, but urged the US and its allies for more weaponry and speedier delivery. “Of course, we need more. But I am happy that he is helping us now,” Zelenskiy told CNN. “I feel that right now we are having a cleaner dialogue. It’s been a dialogue that’s had some twists and turns. And not just talk. It’s been very, very difficult because there aren’t many countries that have really helped us.” The Ukrainian president also reiterated fears that Russian forces could deploy chemical or tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine. “Not only me, all of the world, all of the countries have to be worried… because it [use of nuclear weapons] can be not real information, but it can be truth.” “Chemical weapons… they could do it, for them the life of the people, nothing. That’s why,” Zelenskiy said. “We should think not be afraid, not be afraid but be ready. But that is not a question for Ukraine, not only for Ukraine but for all the world, I think.” Zelenskiy estimated the number of Ukrainian military fatalities at between 2,500 to 3,000 adding around 10,000 more have been injured so far “and it’s hard to say how many will survive.” He claimed Russia had lost up to 20,000 troops, which has not been confirmed.",News/World news,‘I think he will’: Zelenskiy hopeful President Biden will visit Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/17/zelenskiy-cnn-interview-biden
