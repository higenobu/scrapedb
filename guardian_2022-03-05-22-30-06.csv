3/5/2022,"How should we deal with children’s anxiety over what’s happening in Ukraine? I wonder if the question should be: how do we deal with our own? Our kids will pick up on how we are feeling and are likely to mirror our own emotive state. Even if you don’t mean to expose them to news, children will realise that something is going on. It may not concern younger children at all but those who are a bit older or old enough to have a smartphone may well be worried, and even work themselves up into a bit of a frenzy. For a greater proportion of their lives than ours, they have lived with the pandemic and have been isolated for long periods of time from their peers. On the whole, this has not helped their mental health. So it is bad timing that they are now surrounded by war reporting. We cannot deny what is going on. Keeping secrets, speaking in whispers will only make them paranoid and more pessimistic. If you want to talk to your children about anything you might find emotionally charged, including war, it is a good idea to ask them what they already know about it. If they ask questions, you won’t know all the answers and that’s OK – you can look things up together and throw in a lesson at the same time about what is a reliable source of news. There are three main ways we deal with feelings, ours and our children’s. We either repress and minimise them or we are completely at their mercy and maximise them, or there is the middle way where we acknowledge and contain them. It will be no surprise to you that I am in favour of the middle way. It is trickier to negotiate than the other two, which we may be more naturally inclined to lurch towards. It takes thought and practice. Open, honest dialogue with children will help them to put into words how they feel. The more they can put into words, the less likely anxiety will show itself in tummy aches and/or inconvenient behaviour. It isn’t appropriate to say, “we are all doomed and the apocalypse is imminent”, nor is it desirable to tell them everything is perfectly fine; better to say that concern is appropriate, and that you can understand they are worried. It is natural to want our children to be happy all the time, but we compromise their capacity for happiness when we try to shut down feelings that we might see as undesirable, such as being panicked or worried. Give them your attention and enough space for them to feel heard and for you to normalise their feelings. Your job is to validate those feelings rather than making them feel crazier by telling them they have nothing to worry about. It would be more comforting for them if you said something like: “it’s OK to feel scared and I’m here to listen”. I think it is desirable, even if you have a personal propensity to panic, to be calm and optimistic that the adults in charge are working to solve the situation and will probably manage it. By containing your own feelings with such sanguinity, you will help to contain your children’s. The best thing we can all do if we are not in a war zone is to appreciate the relative peace we have and not to dwell in a mythical future where it has all gone wrong. Making good memories for children is investing in their future capacity for happiness. We can remind them that concern is natural and it’s good that they feel for people getting bombed and fleeing their homes, but it is our duty to enjoy our freedom as we have it now and get outside and kick a ball around (or however you usually have fun with your children). If they are worried about being nuked, we can reassure them that Putin wouldn’t really want to risk being nuked back (and we can privately reassure ourselves that it will be quick and painless). But you each know your own children best. You know what information they need, what is too much, what is too little. You know who needs a cuddle to feel safe and who needs to play a game.

3/5/2022,"Somehow playing Batman or the Joker has become the modern equivalents of an actor playing the Dane. And so Robert Pattinson displays his chops with the latest gritty interpretation of the bat-based vigilante. The almost three-hour (!) epic The Batman is a star-laden affair, with Colin Farrell, Jeffrey Wright, John Turturro, and Zoë Kravitz as Catwoman. Kravitz previously voiced Catwoman in (“sophisticated”) animation The Lego Batman Movie (streaming everywhere). In 2020, she revived High Fidelity, now in prestige TV form (Disney+), though it was cancelled after one season. The series, transplanted to New York, built on the blokey record shop foundations of Stephen Frears’ Chicago-set adaptation starring John Cusack in 2000, and Nick Hornby’s 1995 novel from back when north London was approaching its Blairite/Wengerist imperial era. Later Hornby expanded his catalogue with a collection of successful screenplays. Moving beyond N-based postcodes, he shifted to 1950s Wexford and New York, and picked up an Oscar nomination in 2015 for his deft adaptation of Colm Toíbín’s tender novel Brooklyn, starring Saoirse Ronan. That novel, 51st on the Guardian’s best of the 21st century, was edited by Nan Graham. The New York super-editor and publisher at Scribner has fingerprints on many heavy-hitting books of recent decades: be it Jennifer Egan or Stephen King; The Satanic Verses or Hillary Clinton’s autobiography. In the late 90s she was on board for Don DeLillo’s Underworld – a trip down the rabbit hole of America in the 20th century. Several years after DeLillo’s epic came the underwhelming Cosmopolis, which was turned into a film by David Cronenberg (our review called it “cumbersome”). It concerns a day in the life of a young billionaire, played by The Batman himself, Robert Pattinson, and came as he sought to eclipse his Twilight fame with more serious fare. “A rat became the unit of currency” is the elliptical epigraph of both film and book, quoting Polish poet Zbigniew Herbert; now it seems to be a bat. Watch Pattinson excelled alongside Willem Dafoe in 2019’s strange, unsettling, scatological The Lighthouse (Netflix). Director Robert Eggers’ next outing is a Viking epic, due shortly. Eat In a GQ interview, Pattinson explained his idea for a handheld fast food pasta concern, somehow involving a parcel of penne, cheese, sugar, “a sauce”, breadcrumbs and a burger bun. Try it?

3/5/2022,"More than a third of working-age people in the UK now suffer from a long-term illness, with new figures showing a dramatic rise since the pandemic began. Post-Covid conditions, including long Covid, breathing difficulties and mental-health problems, are among the causes, according to disability charities and health campaigners. An Observer analysis of the Office for National Statistics’ (ONS) labour market status of disabled people figures shows that nearly 14.2 million people in the UK aged 16 to 64 said they had a health condition lasting for at least 12 months in 2021 – a rise of 1.2 million during the two years of the pandemic. Levels of long-term ill-health had been rising more slowly before the emergence of Covid, at an annual average of about 275,000 cases a year between 2014 and 2018, but the rapid increase over the last two years highlights the health problems facing the UK, says the disability charity Scope. About 800,000 more people suffered from mental-health problems in 2020-21 than did so in 2018-19, Scope said, and the number of people with chest and breathing problems had grown by about 570,000 over the same period. James Taylor, Scope’s director of strategy, said: “These figures show the ongoing shock waves of the past two years continue to affect lives today. We’re concerned things will continue to get worse as time goes on. “ These figures could mean more people living with the extra costs that come with disability. As the cost of living crisis continues to bite, we know that disabled people are twice as likely to live in a cold house and three times as likely to not have been able to afford food. “The government needs to get a grip on the cost of living crisis, and target financial support directly at disabled people.” Long Covid is another factor. The latest ONS long Covid report estimates that 1.5 million have had Covid symptoms for more than four weeks, and 685,000 people had symptoms that had lasted more than a year. Further analysis by Long Covid Kids shows that people with pre-existing conditions are more likely to suffer long Covid than those without. Those whose activity is limited are, on average, more than three times as likely to suffer long Covid as those with no pre-existing conditions. Dr Susannah Thompson was infected in April 2020 while working as a GP in her local hospital’s urgent care centre in north-west England. She made a “slow, gradual recovery” over the next months and was involved in setting up the GP-led vaccination programme until she had a “massive relapse” in January 2021. “I ended up in hospital, rushed into resus [resuscitation],” she said. “I struggled to even hold a pen to write my name.” She has had constant leg pain, chilblains, brain fog – and even sitting up can send her heart racing to 140 beats per minute. “Since then I haven’t been able to see a patient,” she said. “I’ve always been active – I was a cold-water sea swimmer. I went from being able to throw myself in the sea twice a week to struggling to get in and out of a bath.” She now uses an electric wheelchair to take her children to school and is on sick leave from her roles as GP and medical director. “It feels like we’re ignoring long Covid,” Thompson said. “People in the middle of their lives are getting robbed of their livelihoods, at risk of losing their homes. I can’t fathom why we don’t try to prevent it. But we’re not.” Ondine Sherwood, co-founder of Long Covid SoS, said: “We don’t yet have data on how many infected during the huge Omicron wave will go on to experience prolonged symptoms, so [numbers] will almost certainly grow. Many, if not most of those with long Covid, are of working age and were previously fit and healthy – there is surely going to be a major effect on the workforce.” She pointed to a study published in Nature last month, which shows that even a mild infection can increase the risk of heart disease for a year after diagnosis. “Given the huge numbers affected, both in the UK and worldwide, there is a real danger that the ‘average’ level of health people enjoy could already be lower and will deteriorate further.”",News/Society,Covid pandemic sparks steep rise in number of people in UK with long-term illness,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/05/covid-pandemic-sparks-steep-rise-in-number-of-people-in-uk-with-long-term-illness
3/5/2022,"As part of a couple you may be used to arranging everyday finances jointly, but when it comes to long-term planning, do you know where you stand? Pension planning tends to be something we do as individuals, but when one partner dies, it could have a big impact on the other’s finances. Cohabiting couples, in particular, can face a raw deal on private pension inheritance rights. Even if you’re married, or in a civil partnership, a partner may receive less than expected. There are no longer rates specifically for married couples – the full state pension is £179.60 a week and the exact amount is based on your national insurance contribution record. However, you may be entitled to extra payments if your spouse or civil partner dies. There were changes to the rules in April 2016 and the amount depends on whether you, and/or your partner, reached state pension age before or after that date. Steve Webb, a former pensions minister and partner at the consultants LCP, says: “The most generous arrangements apply where the spouse who died came under the old system, as the new state pension has very limited scope for inheriting.” If you reached state pension age before 6 April 2016 you fall under the old pension system. Its rules state that a surviving spouse can inherit at least 50% of your “additional” state pension, also known as state second pension. If your partner also retired under the old system, he or she can use your national insurance record to boost their basic state pension after your death. If you’re under the new system, and getting more than the flat rate pension, then 50% of this extra money – the “protected payment” – can be inherited by a spouse or civil partner. If you’re cohabiting, you cannot claim any of a partner’s entitlement. There’s a handy government tool that help you understand whether the state pension is inheritable. The Pension Service should be able to tell you how much, if any, of your partner’s state pension you would be entitled to. Most workers pay into defined contribution pension schemes, whether through an employer or a personal pension, and receive payouts based on the investment performance. If you’re married, any savings left in the pension when you die usually pass to your surviving spouse, unless you’ve stated otherwise on an expression of wish form. This allows you to nominate who you want to receive the money when you die. For a cohabiting partner to receive the fund, they need to be named on this form. “Defined contribution administrators might ask for evidence that you’re living together but they don’t generally have hard rules,” says Helen Morrissey, the senior pensions and retirement analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. Final-salary schemes, based on earnings and how many years you’ve been working for an employer, may come with strict rules about who can receive your pension and how much. Some only pay out to cohabiting partners who have lived together for several years, Morrissey says. Older sections of some big public sector final-salary schemes, such as the 1987 police pension scheme, refuse to pay anything to cohabiting partners. The amount your partner receives depends on the type of scheme and your age when you die. Generally, if it’s before you turn 75 beneficiaries can receive a cash lump sum, or keep it invested for their retirement, and will pay no tax. But if you are 75 or over, beneficiaries will need to pay tax on income taken out. If you’re already receiving an income from an annuity, this typically cannot be passed on. Anyone who has been divorced, then remarried, should check what both their former and existing partner will get, and take advice if this does not meet their requirements. Keep your expression of wish or nominated beneficiary forms up to date, particularly if you cohabit or have been divorced. “These forms are often neglected, but are very important in avoiding disputes over who should get what,” says Rebecca O’Connor, the head of pensions and savings at Interactive Investor. “Your will won’t necessarily cover your pension, as it doesn’t form part of your estate.” If you have access to your pension account online, you can complete the form, and nominate anyone you want. If you buy an annuity at retirement, think about what your partner will inherit. Lee Clark, a financial planner at the wealth manager Brewin Dolphin, says: “If one of you has more significant pension savings, you may choose to buy a joint annuity, providing an income for your partner.” You can increase your state pension entitlement by filling in any gaps in your national insurance record with voluntary contributions, for example. You can also save up to £2,880 in to a pension each tax year if you’re not working, and the government will boost this by £720 through tax relief. Your partner can pay into a pension on your behalf. Some employers will offer to match any extra contributions. Your combined pensions will be included as part of the financial settlement if you divorce, and may be divided in one of three ways. Offsetting: probably the most common way that pensions are divided on divorce, with the value of any retirement savings offset against other assets. For example, one partner might keep their full pension fund, while the other gets the family home. “This may keep things simple but the house won’t provide a retirement income unless it’s sold. A pension is a valuable asset that shouldn’t be overlooked,” O’Connor says. “So carefully consider your future needs, including retirement income, when deciding how to divide up assets as offsetting might not be the best option for you.” Pension sharing: the partner with a smaller pension or without any at all has a share in their partner’s pot put in their name. In this scenario, Sarah Green, a family lawyer at Michelmores, recommends getting an actuary to do a pension sharing report. “The small financial outlay is worthwhile to ensure both parties are in an equal position on retirement.” Earmarking: in this scenario, the partner without a pension may receive a lump sum on death before the ex-partner retires and/or income or lump sums at retirement. However, you must wait until your ex-partner retires to receive a share of the pension benefits, and income will be taxed at the pension scheme member’s rate. So if you are a basic-rate taxpayer, and your ex-partner is higher rate, this is a major disadvantage. When Sabine’s husband, Gregory, died last year she was surprised by the impact it had on her state pension. Her weekly payment, which was earned under the old system and set at £192.95, was cut, and from the date of his death she would get £174.39. During years of working in corporate jobs, Sabine, 78, had built up entitlement to the full state pension which she thought was entirely separate to her husband’s. “I took steps to boost my pension right through my career and was able to retire with a good private pension as well as the state pension earned entirely from my contributions,” she says. “How can this possibly be fair?” Sabine thought there must be a mistake and asked the Department for Work and Pensions to review her case, arguing she was being penalised because she was a widow. But in September it told her that the decision was correct and the £18-a-week cut stood. The maths behind the decision runs to five pages, but Sabine’s pension has been reduced because both she and her husband contracted out of the state earnings-related pension scheme when it existed. This means the national insurance contributions that would have gone into it were directed into their private workplace schemes instead. There is a limit on how much you are allowed to receive in retirement as a result of the opt-out, and because half of the pension Greg built up with his payments goes to Sabine, she has had her own state pension cut. LCP’s Steve Webb says that if neither spouse had contracted out, Sabine would be due more, but effectively a deal had been done when Greg was still working. He paid a reduced level of NI and in return his scheme offered to make up what the state would have paid. “For someone who has just been widowed it can come as a shock to find that their state pension could – in rare circumstances – actually fall,” Webb said. “In effect, the company pension is delivering part of the state pension on behalf of the government. The total income of the newly bereaved person should go up, even if one component – the state pension – has gone down.” Webb says Sabine’s case is unusual because many women have lower national insurance contributions when they retire, so their state pension increases when they inherit some of their husband’s entitlement. However, she had already earned 100% in her own right. Sabine gets £37.33 a week from Greg’s company pension for the bit linked to the contracting out, but it has been a shock to her to find that her state pension could be cut. “I know from everyone that I have spoken to that no reasonable person would regard this as a reasonable outcome,” she says.

3/5/2022,"For the last 10 years, residents in the south Baltimore neighborhood of Cherry Hill who struggled to access affordable food had a reliable place to go. Visitors to the Cherry Hill Urban Community Garden, a 1.5-acre urban farm, would find cheap, fresh vegetables and a strong sense of community. But in the spring of 2021, the farm received an eviction notice. For Eric Jackson, servant director of the Black Yield Institute which managed the land, it was a huge blow. The farm’s influence went far beyond the kale, peppers and other fresh produce it sold at 50% below market rate, he says. “It gives people hope. I know hope is cliche, but it gives people a glimpse of what we can be by teaching tangible skills and providing opportunities for relationship building,” Jackson says. “It’s been called a church without walls.” Set up in 2010 on a vacant lot, the urban farm had an expired lease with the Housing Authority of Baltimore City, operating on what Jackson calls a “gentlemen’s agreement” that would be renewed year after year. In June 2021, the authority suddenly decided the time had come to take it back to build housing on the plot. By December 2021, BYI had been evicted and Cherry Hill Urban Community Garden lay empty. What happened in Baltimore is not an isolated event. Urban farms around the US are increasingly important, especially in “food desert” neighborhoods, yet they face big challenges with land security. It’s a struggle that particularly affects Black farmers: people of color own only 3% of all agricultural land in the US and Black farmers make up only 1.3% of farmers. Verbal and temporary leases are common, says Neith Grace Little, urban agriculture educator at the University of Maryland Extension in Baltimore. This can put urban farmers at a disadvantage, especially when developers show interest. Farmers can easily be forced to move, forfeiting years of investment. Little advises urban farmers to buy land if they can, but ownership remains out of reach for many as gentrification pushes prices up and complex city bureaucracy locks farmers out. A third of participants in a University of Maryland survey of more than 400 urban farmers across the north-east said that land access is a huge barrier, with only one-third saying they owned the land they steward. Finding ways to give urban farms land security is one of the most efficient ways to improve the food ecosystem, says Baltimore councilman Kristerfer Burnett, especially as Covid disrupts supply chains and food prices rise. “You go to the grocery store and you see the empty shelves. With shipping delays and worker shortages, food insecurity will be more apparent,” he says. Burnett is pushing for measures to support urban farms, including creating incentives for land ownership through models such as community land trusts, where non-profits buy and keep land in trust for the benefit of the community. It’s a form of ownership that’s working well for an urban farm nearly 800 miles from Baltimore. The Victory Garden Initiative in Milwaukee is home to several community gardens and a 1.5-acre urban farm owned through a community land trust. Land ownership gives the organization more freedom to serve the community, says its executive director, Michelle Dobbs. Launched in 2009 in the predominantly Black neighborhood of Harambee, the organization was inspired by the victory garden effort of the first and second world wars, where people grew fruit and vegetables in any outside space they had. The context may be very different now but the sense of urgency is the same, says Dobbs. During the waves of the pandemic many people struggled to access food staples. “Urban gardens have proved to be a saving grace,” she says. “We have so much food on our land we just started giving it away.” The farm was converted into an emergency food distribution center. They made canned spaghetti sauce from tomatoes and included it in food boxes along with berries, greens, potatoes and other items from the garden. For Dobbs, security over the land has helped the farm better serve the community. “I feel safe, with our land being held in trust, that developers cannot develop the neighborhood for other purposes, right beneath our feet,” says Dobbs. “People need and want this food we’re growing.” It’s this same powerful community need that’s also driving an effort in Detroit to make ownership a priority for Black urban farmers. For decades Detroit has had a thriving urban farm movement. In the majority Black city known for blight, urban farmers saw abandoned lots as an opportunity to feed the community. But until relatively recently, most remained illegal, usually because the farmer didn’t own the land or due to zoning laws. It wasn’t until 2013 that an urban agriculture ordinance gave some protection. But Black farmers in Detroit still lose out, says Jerry Ann Hebron, executive director of Oakland Avenue Urban Farm, which grows more than 33 varieties of fruits and vegetables in the city’s North End neighborhood. They can’t compete with top-dollar offers by speculative land developers. “We were farming on land we didn’t own and at any day we could be displaced” Hebron says. For the last few years, Hebron has seen several urban farms evicted by city agencies and private landowners without explanation or compensation. It cost one farm $40,000 to relocate when it was evicted. People with more resources were able to navigate the system to buy land resulting in widespread gentrification, she says. In an effort to change this, Hebron’s farm, along with the Detroit Black Community Food Security Network and Keep Growing Detroit, founded the Detroit Black Farmer Land Fund, a coalition aiming to increase land ownership for Black farmers in the city. In its first year, the fund managed to raise $55,000 through a crowdfunding campaign, 10 times more than its original goal. “The donations came pouring in and that’s when we were able to help our Black farmers,” says Hebron. The Black Farmer Land Fund distributed $2,000 to 30 urban farmers and bought some vacant lots in blighted neighborhoods for as little as $500. The Black Farmer Land Fund has started working with the Detroit Land Bank Authority, a public agency that manages the city’s abandoned properties, to create an easier path to ownership for Black urban farmers. Black farmers have been socially disfranchised, Hebron says: “We are focused on trying to bring equity, land ownership and economic security to their families.” Detroit now has more than 200 acres of urban farmland and these farms are an essential part of the food chain, she says. While they contribute to the wellbeing of the community, Hebron also believes they can be a source of generational wealth for Black farmers. Back in Baltimore, the Black Yield Institute is now farming a new plot of land in the Mount Clare neighborhood. Moving equipment, uprooting plants and other relocation expenses have cost the organization close to $30,000, not including expenses to set up the new farm. “Not only did they evict us, but they left us with a bill,” Jackson says. “Now, we have to raise money to buy land. Who’s going to pay for that?” The organization has a right to use the land for two years and has launched a fundraising campaign to buy it. Growing healthy food accessible to those living in food deserts is not only a service but for Jackson and other urban farmers like him it’s a movement. But the movement remans vulnerable. “There is no policy that protects land or earmarks land that’s available for agriculture and supports urban agriculture,” Jackson says. “If we can secure land reparations we would be in a better position to have the money, resources and power to be able to grow and advance urban agriculture for Black people, Black farmers and Black families.” For now, Jackson says: “We will continue to be a faith institution without walls. Wherever we are, we will steward the land to our best capacity and we will continue to do the work.”",News/Environment,Black-led urban farms are thriving – until they have to fight for their land,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/05/black-led-urban-farms-are-thriving-until-they-have-to-fight-for-their-land
3/5/2022,"Plans to mark the 150th anniversary of Ralph Vaughan Williams’s birth have been years in the making, but no one could have imagined how prescient last weekend’s Manchester launch event would turn out to be. On a night when Russian tanks were encroaching further into Ukraine, two of the composer’s finest symphonies – both conceived in time of war, both firmly rejecting military bombast – sent a message of hope and a vision of peace out into the anxious air. Undoubtedly sensing the bleak headlines, the BBC Philharmonic, sharing a new season of RVW’s nine symphonies with the Hallé, played his fifth with a particularly lush intensity, echoing the words of Adrian Boult, who heard its premiere in 1943 and wrote: “Its serene loveliness is completely satisfying in these times and shows, as only music can, what we must work for when this madness is over.” Conductor Mark Wigglesworth sought to challenge today’s madness by amplifying the rich humanity that flows through this symphony, shaping the expansive first movement to hold us in its tender embrace, profound in its vision of a better world. The Romanza, the real heart of the fifth, was particularly fine, bold and resolute strings turning its noble descending theme into an anthem of consoling reassurance. Wigglesworth had opened with RVW’s third symphony (1922), the Pastoral, a work that prefigures the fifth in its tranquil survey of an apparent rural idyll, disparaged at the time by composer Peter Warlock as “a cow looking over a gate”. How wrong. This is Vaughan Williams’s musical recollection of France in the first world war. The modal inflections of English folk song give the piece its distinctly bucolic atmosphere, but the countryside it evokes is a battlefield. Recalling his time as an ambulance driver, when he would collect the wounded “night after night”, he wrote: “We went up a steep hill and there was a wonderful Corot-like landscape in the sunset – [the music is] not really lambkins frisking at all, as most people take for granted.” And so Wigglesworth and the BBC Philharmonic rightly emphasised the bitonal clashes and dark undertones that menace just beneath the surface in this piece. No lambkins here. Instead, a stately, measured reading of a symphony that rarely rouses itself above mezzo-forte, its beautifully played trumpet and horn solos recalling buglers in the trenches and off-stage tenor (Alessandro Fisher) voicing a wordless lament for lost comrades, because no words can adequately express such desolation. RVW’s studies with Ravel added an iridescent lustre to his already distinctive musical palette, perhaps most evident in his song cycle On Wenlock Edge, sung here with a light, though occasionally overwhelmed, loveliness by Fisher, and accompanied with mercurial energy by Wigglesworth in this impressive opening to the year’s celebrations. The Vaughan Williams Charitable Trust has worked hard to prime concerts and festivals with his music this year. You are bound to find several near you. And to understand just how deeply RVW’s music runs through the nation’s bloodstream, from June a project entitled From Pub to Pulpit will visit several cathedrals, showing how the composer “borrowed” the folk songs he collected when he edited The English Hymnal. O Little Town of Bethlehem? That’s The Ploughboy’s Dream. Or To Be a Pilgrim? That’s the shanty Our Captain Cried All Hands. Who knew? It’s hard to challenge the notion that Martha Argerich is our greatest living pianist. At 80, she continues to play with apparently effortless technique and astonishing strength. Yet she has not played a solo concert for 30 years, preferring instead to partner with an orchestra or another pianist, such as Sergei Babayan. Their 2018 recording of his two-piano arrangements of Prokofiev’s ballet and stage music drew much praise, so to hear them play live at Wigmore Hall was a rare treat. Argerich took the upstage piano, but that did not in any way denote a lesser role. The pair threw themselves into the thunderous opening Prologue from Romeo and Juliet with such intensity it drew gasps from the audience. Thereafter they entranced with the sheer power and dazzling command of their playing. At times, no dancer would have been able to compete with their tempi, and certainly no string section could match the breakneck speed they brought to the Death of Tybalt. Later, we left the violence behind to hear dreamlike mazurkas, polkas and polonaises from Prokofiev’s unfinished incidental music for Pushkin’s Eugene Onegin and The Queen of Spades, Argerich and Babayan enjoying their harmonic subtleties and quixotic melodies. But it was in Mozart’s sparkling Sonata in D for two pianos that their brilliant partnership was at its most equal. Close your eyes and it was impossible to tell who was playing what line, so seamless was their joyful passing of the baton. Sheer delight.
