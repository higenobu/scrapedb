4/10/2022,"Roy Hodgson has never been relegated as a Premier League manager but his unblemished record is in grave danger of being tarnished, with Watford facing demotion to the Championship after their ninth successive home defeat. Hodgson always knew the odds were stacked against him when he replaced Claudio Ranieri in January but their heavy loss to Leeds at Vicarage Road leaves them needing a miraculous recovery to avoid the drop. Everton’s win over Manchester United earlier in the day only heightened the pressure on Watford to end a dismal winless run at Vicarage Road, stretching back to November, but there is no end in sight to their home sickness after another dispiriting defeat. Leeds appeared in major trouble themselves during the porous end to Marcelo Bielsa’s tenure but his successor Jesse Marsch has tightened them up defensively, with their third win in four games easing them towards safety. Leeds started sharply and spurned an early opportunity when Luke Ayling powered a header over the crossbar from a corner. Watford almost opened the scoring in the 14th minute but Imran Louza curled his free-kick just past Illan Meslier’s far post. Cucho Hernández curled in another dangerous free-kick from the edge of the penalty area but Meslier touched the ball to safety as the hosts pushed for the breakthrough. But Leeds clinically punished Watford by taking the lead midway through the half. Samir failed to clear the ball and Raphinha took advantage with a stunning finish beyond Ben Foster for his 10th goal of the season. The hosts were forced into a change before half-time with Hernández suffering an injury and Emmanuel Dennis brought into the attack. Watford still appeared reliant on set-pieces to create openings, against a team whose last clean sheet was back in November, with Meslier punching Kiko Femenía’s corner to safety in the final action of the half. Leeds cut Watford open on the break after the restart with Raphinha playing in Dan James but Christian Kabasele made a strong challenge to deny the forward. Kalvin Phillips continued his return to fitness with the England midfielder introduced just before the hour mark for Leeds. João Pedro blasted high and wide and Watford spurned another opportunity in quick succession with Ismaïla Sarr lacking composure as he rashly failed to find the target. Juraj Kucka also dragged a shot harmlessly wide as the home fans’ frustration grew. Leeds were content to soak up the pressure and play on the counterattack with toothless Watford still struggling to find the finishing touch. Phillips almost made an immediate impact but his fierce strike from the edge of the area was parried to safety by Foster. Watford’s hopes of a comeback were ended disastrously in the 73rd minute when Hassane Kamara and Samir failed to clear the danger and the Brazilian defender fumbled the ball into the path of Rodrigo for the forward to round Foster and slot into the empty net. It was a calamitous goal for Hodgson’s side to concede and Jack Harrison’s powerful strike, his third in as many games, past the despairing dive of Foster, completed another miserable home defeat. With only seven matches remaining and six points from safety, time is almost up for Watford.",Sport/Football,Time running short for Watford as Jack Harrison seals handsome win for Leeds,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/09/watford-leeds-premier-league-match-report
4/10/2022,"Millions of birds have died in the US in recent weeks, because of a contagious strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza, popularly known as bird flu. The bird flu has also led zoos across the US to temporarily close aviary exhibits and move birds away from the public. At zoos from Colorado to Maryland, species ranging from ostriches to penguins have been moved indoors. The virus poses a low risk to humans, but the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has estimated that nearly 24m poultry birds, mostly chickens and turkeys, have died of the flu since February, when a flock of turkeys in Indiana were confirmed to have the virus. The bird flu has been seen in at least 24 states. Last seen in the US in 2015, bird flu arrives through wild migratory birds, the season for which lasts from March to May. Wild birds, including waterfowl like ducks and geese, tend to not get sick when infected. Farmed chickens and turkeys are highly susceptible. As a result, poultry meat and eggs are in tighter supply. In Iowa, the state that produces the most eggs, more than 11m of 56m egg-laying hens have died. “As long as the [wild bird] migration patterns continue, there is a risk for disease to continue to be introduced to our domestic population,” Chloe Carson, the communications director of the Iowa agriculture department, told CNN. Egg prices have risen. The average price of a dozen eggs has reached $2.60, compared to around $1.40 at the same time last year, according to the USDA. The agriculture secretary, Tom Vilsack, told reporters on Tuesday that because poultry facilities developed stricter containment measures after the last bird flu outbreak in 2015, they are better equipped to prevent the virus spreading. “The nature of the outbreaks, the size of the operations that have been impacted, the number of states that are dealing with backyard operations as opposed to commercial-sized operations, would strongly suggest that when this is all said and done, it’s going to be significantly less than what we experienced in 2014-15,” Vilsack said. ZOO UPDATE: Cases of avian flu have been confirmed across the US, including Maryland. This strain of the disease is highly contagious and lethal to birds. As a precautionary measure, most avian species will be off exhibit until the threat has subsided: https://t.co/PzV65XbXpQ pic.twitter.com/rCgFeIkPBM Zoos have also taken precautionary measures. In a statement, the Maryland zoo said: “We have moved birds that are more likely to come in contact with migrating waterfowl. “These birds have been moved to indoor housing. Because the disease can be tracked on shoes, zoo aviaries have been closed and indoor contact with birds is limited to a small number of staff.” While previous bird flu viruses have affected humans, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has noted that this current virus has so far posed a low risk to the general public’s health. “Some people may have job-related or recreational exposures to birds that put them at higher risk of infection,” the CDC said. “The CDC is watching this situation closely and taking routine preparedness and prevention measures in case this virus changes to pose a greater human health risk.”",News/World news,Millions of bird deaths as US hit by avian flu outbreak,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/09/bird-flu-millions-birds-avian-influenza
4/10/2022,"The royal family have shared a poem in tribute to the late Prince Philip on the first anniversary of his death. The elegy was written by the poet laureate Simon Armitage and shared via official royal social media accounts on Saturday. Entitled ‘The Patriarchs – An Elegy’, the poem is read by Armitage over piano music and accompanied by a video montage of photographs from the Duke of Edinburgh’s life, including images of his wedding day and the birth of his four children. First published on the day of his funeral last year, it pays particular tribute to his career in the Royal Navy. It reads: “On such an occasion / to presume to eulogise one man is to pipe up / for a whole generation – that crew whose survival / was always the stuff of minor miracle, / who came ashore in orange-crate coracles, / fought ingenious wars, finagled triumphs at sea / with flaming decoy boats, and side-stepped torpedoes.” Armitage describes the duke’s generation as “husbands to duty”, “great-grandfathers from birth”, and “last of the great avuncular magicians” in the poem, before concluding in the final verse: “But for now, a cold April’s closing moments / parachute slowly home, so by mid-afternoon / snow is recast as seed heads and thistledown.” Remembering His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh on the first anniversary of his death.Find out more about his life and legacy at: https://t.co/6tFq2vjyNkWords: ‘The Patriarchs – An Elegy’ by Poet Laureate Simon Armitage pic.twitter.com/WpB2L6D75K The Queen – who described Philip as her “constant strength and guide” – is believed to be at Windsor Castle on Saturday and it is understood she will mark the first anniversary of the death of her husband privately. Philip died in his sleep at his Windsor Castle home on 9 April 2021. His death was announced by Buckingham Palace just after midday. It was marked by hundreds of tributes from world leaders and dignitaries, as well as the charities he supported. He became internationally recognised after marrying the Queen more than 70 years ago. He died just months before his 100th birthday. Philip’s funeral at Saint George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle was attended by just 30 mourners due to Covid restrictions. The Queen was famously pictured sitting alone in the pews wearing a face mask. The Dean of Windsor, Right Rev David Conner, paid tribute to the Duke’s achievements, as well as his shortcomings, at a recent service of thanksgiving for his life. He described Philip as a man of “passionate commitment” who devoted his “intellectual and physical energy” to a “host of down to earth enterprises”. However, Rev Conner said the Duke could also be “abrupt” in a “robust conversation, forgetting just how intimidating he could be”.",News/UK news,Royal family shares poem in tribute to the late Prince Philip by poet laureate,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/09/royal-family-shares-poem-in-tribute-to-the-late-prince-philip-by-poet-laureate
4/10/2022,"Whether it was a Fortnum & Mason selection box or a stash of Freddos we may never know but after Thomas Tuchel said he munched his way through copious amounts of chocolate to ease the pain of reliving Chelsea’s defeat to Real Madrid in midweek, his team displayed a ravenous appetite to make amends by bludgeoning Southampton. Chelsea picked their opponents apart, Timo Werner and Mason Mount scoring twice and Marcos Alonso and Kai Havertz also striking inside 54 minutes. Werner celebrated his first league goals since October but when you consider he also struck the woodwork twice, as well as Fraser Forster’s inspired goalkeeping, it was a miracle Chelsea only finished with six goals. As reactions go, this was rather comprehensive. It almost felt satirical when at half-time the stadium announcer, presumably reading off a script, offered a warm welcome to a family visiting St Mary’s. Chelsea would have had five goals at the break had Forster not clambered low to his right to somehow claw a Ruben Loftus-Cheek header, diverted by Mohammed Salisu’s outstretched leg, to safety. A minute earlier, a Mount shot deflected off Jan Bednarek and dropped nervously wide. By then a rocked Ralph Hasenhüttl, hands on hips on the edge of the technical area, had already taken unprecedented action, replacing the midfielder Oriol Romeu with Yan Valery and shifting to a three-man defence, presumably in the name of damage limitation. Those 9-0 shellackings, here to Leicester in 2019 and at Manchester United in 2021, must have been lingering in the back of his mind. The midfielder Ibrahima Diallo replaced the striker Adam Armstrong for the second half but changes in shape and personnel made little difference. With 54 minutes gone Chelsea, all in yellow, had racked up six goals without reply and continued to slice through Southampton at will. For the fifth, Werner feasted on the rebound after Forster repelled N’Golo Kanté’s dinked shot and then five minutes later Mount poked in from close range. The sixth was particularly galling for Forster, who kept out the substitute Christian Pulisic’s initial shot and then raked the ball away from Werner with his feet only for Mount to notch his second. Pulisic, one of four changes from defeat on Wednesday, arrived in place of Havertz at the interval and Tuchel had the luxury of being able to withdraw Thiago Silva with little more than an hour played with Tuesday’s trip to Madrid in mind. Alonso flashed wide as Chelsea went in pursuit of a seventh in the second half, during which Mount was withdrawn for Hakim Ziyech, who passed a fitness test on Friday. Chelsea actually began erratically. Antonio Rüdiger lost his bearings on the touchline midway inside his own half and his back pass meant for Édouard Mendy went horribly awry and out for a Southampton corner with 90 seconds on the clock. But from there it was one-way traffic. Chelsea surged forward on a counterattack that culminated in Werner rattling a post after striking at goal from just inside the box. On six minutes Werner tested the woodwork once more, this time heading against the bar after stooping to meet Ruben Loftus-Cheek’s cross but two minutes later Chelsea eased into the lead when Alonso drilled in. Loftus-Cheek picked out Mount, who was allowed to control and hook the ball behind him for an unmarked Alonso to do the rest, the wing-back firing through the legs of Forster. Little did Forster know what was to come. Mount’s first goal was a peach, the midfielder arrowing a right-foot shot into the bottom corner on 16 minutes as Chelsea took advantage of more statuesque Southampton defending. Salisu did not deal with Loftus-Cheek’s cross and Mount put his studs on the top of the ball to get it under his spell before dispatching a superb strike into a pocket of Forster’s net with his next touch. The Southampton goalkeeper denied Chelsea a third with less than 18 minutes played, pawing a lashed Werner shot clear, but four minutes later he was fishing the ball out of his net once more. It was comedic and clinical in equal measure, at least for the neutral. Werner again struck the frame of the goal, curling a shot against the inside of a post after gracefully moseying clear of Romeu, Bednarek and Kyle Walker-Peters but Havertz was on hand to tap in the leftovers. At that point, Valery was readied on the touchline and swathes of Southampton supporters headed for the exits. “Oh when the Saints go marching out,” Chelsea’s visiting supporters gleefully sang.",Sport/Football,Mason Mount and Timo Werner double up as Chelsea put six past Southampton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/09/southampton-chelsea-premier-league-match-report
4/10/2022,"Rishi Sunak is on the ropes, and not just over accusations that he has been less than transparent about his personal finances and those of his wife. The chancellor looks as if he only needs a top hat and morning coat to complete his transformation to a hard-faced Victorian financier, aloof from the concerns of ordinary people. Details of his expensive homes, cars and holidays abroad only reinforce the image of a minister out of touch with his voters. If he listened to the daytime radio phone-ins, he would hear the personal stories of hungry and shivering families brought low by the cost-of-living crisis. Those callers are selling cars, not buying them. They are delaying trips to the launderette for cost reasons and falling into arrears on debts. Council tax increases stretching back more than five years play their part in pushing the cost of living higher, as does the freeze on income tax thresholds. A national insurance rise this month is another added cost, even though the chancellor will point out that it exempts low-income families. He forgets they are already under water after the loss of £20 a week from their universal credit income last year. To escape criticism, Sunak draws attention to the one major element of the economy judged a success – the employment market. Almost everyone who wants a job has a job. What could be better? Setting aside the fact that the unemployment figures are flattered by 500,000 people leaving the workforce, and that a lack of decent sick pay means many people with Covid work when they should be at home recuperating, the fact is that most of the people complaining about their dire circumstances are in work. Most analysts expect labour market figures this week from the Office for National Statistics, covering the three months to February, to record another month of falling unemployment. But the data will show that inflation-adjusted wages are falling too. In January, pay growth excluding bonuses was 3.8% among employees. Meanwhile, the consumer prices index rose by 5.5%. The situation in February is likely to be worse as wage growth stagnates and inflation, which we already know hit 6.2% that month, continues on its way to 8% or more. In the fortnight since his spring statement, Sunak has refused to adopt any further measures to alleviate this financial squeeze on households. He won’t reinstate the £20 a week universal credit cut or increase the £150 council tax rebate. The £200 cut to energy bills in October is still a loan. He says the government’s finances are precarious, amid modestly rising debt bills. One response could be to impose a windfall tax on North Sea oil companies, which could easily raise £4bn, to offset the worst of household inflation. But again, he refuses. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has spent more time than Sunak rejecting the opposition parties’ calls for such a tax, saying they misunderstand how business works. Let’s take that claim head-on and ask what a windfall profit means to a business. That was a question asked by economist Olivier Blanchard – the former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, who is still a driving force at the Washington-based Peterson Institute – in the 1990s. He found that windfall profits were not used by firms to fund investment because they were by definition unsustainable. Investments are planned over five years or more and based on forecast profits over that time, especially in the oil and gas industry. However, if the excess cash were retained instead of invested, the company might become a takeover target. Another option might be to reward bosses with the windfall, but the bonuses would be unearned and shareholders would rightly object. He concluded, after examining a string of situations where companies found themselves showered with money, that unless there were debt holes to plug, the only way to handle windfall profits was to distribute them to shareholders. North Sea production companies, all of which are now swimming in cash from high oil and gas prices, are likely to follow the same course. So it is Kwarteng who misunderstands business, and not Labour or the Lib Dems, when he says a windfall tax would undermine investment. He also misunderstands the stock market when he says pensioners are shareholders and would miss out on rising share values. How can that be when pension funds own less than 10% of the UK market? All good chancellors steal the opposition’s best policies, and this is an occasion when Sunak could do himself a favour. Oil needs to stay in the ground and excess profits should be claimed back by those who generated them – the public. Surely the government will do something. If it won’t tax the companies benefiting most egregiously from the war in Ukraine, the local elections in May could prove a turning point.",News/Business,Sunak must impose a windfall tax on oil firms – even if only to save his career,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/09/sunak-must-impose-a-windfall-tax-on-oil-firms-even-if-only-to-save-his-career
4/10/2022,"Last Sunday night, almost four million people tuned in to witness Cillian Murphy signing off as Tommy Shelby – for now, at least. The finale of Peaky Blinders, which had spent much of the season hinting that it might do away with our antihero for good, instead opted to keep matters open, with a masterful twist that might as well have been an apology for all of the meandering routes it took to get there. (I can’t have been the only one wondering why the gangster-turned-MP, who remained handy with a firearm and loose with the law, still appeared to have more scruples and ethics than most of the bunch currently in charge of the country.) The final episode was a deserved reward for those of us who stuck with the show, during what I found to be a confusing last season. I spent much of it trying to work out why Tommy was in bed with Oswald Mosley, figuratively, and with Diana Mitford, literally, and how the IRA factored into fascism and what that had to do with the opium trade in Boston. About halfway through, I found the best approach was to avoid actively attempting to make sense of it and instead let the spectacle carry me to the end. Without that last episode, I suspect I would have felt a bit cheated, but with it, it felt like a fair deal. Another series that increasingly seems as if it is driven by spectacle over sense is Killing Eve, also in its final stages, which will soon attempt to wrap it all up in a neat bow. Good luck with that. Like Peaky Blinders, I have stuck with it and each episode is pleasurable: it looks good, travels the world, has a sense of humour and a brilliant cast. But I have long since given up on trying to fathom what, exactly, the point of it is, especially when it comes to The 12, the mysterious group at the centre of the plot. Who is in The 12, who is out of The 12, who wants them dead and why? Does it matter? We may found out. It is just as likely that we won’t. I am willing to accept that, as I was often warned it would, too much television has turned my brain to mush. Then again, I have also been catching up on last year’s Station Eleven, which has a tricky structure and premise, and its complexities have been handled deftly, to magical effect. I have nothing against surface charm, but I was pleased to find a series that pushes beyond it. Last week’s edition of the New Yorker included a rambunctious profile of the actor Natasha Lyonne, whose career has been long, varied and always intriguing. Lyonne was promoting the new season of her series Russian Doll, a thought experiment disguised as a timeloop comedy, though she talked a good talk about everything from quantum physics to inherited trauma. One of my favourite parts came when the writer of the piece notes seeing two of Lyonne’s acting awards, for her comeback stint in Orange Is the New Black, on her piano in her New York apartment. “You always read about people who say, ‘I put my awards directly in the garbage, because I’m grounded’. No! Put your awards where people can see them!” said Lyonne, describing those who take the more low-key approach as “schmucks”. I am all for an end to faux-humility, and women celebrating themselves for a job well done. I read a lot about the great EastEnders star June Brown last week, who died at 95, and many of the stories came with a sense of, “they don’t make them like they used to”. But for a moment, reading that profile of Lyonne, I thought that perhaps they still do. The Conservative politician Baroness McIntosh of Pickering has called for a ban on cyclists using mobile phones after a close encounter near the Houses of Parliament, in which a cyclist came towards her, “one hand bicycling, one hand on the mobile phone, on the wrong side of the road”. Motorists, of course, are banned from using phones while driving, but cyclists would face less specific prosecution for careless or dangerous cycling. The former minister wondered why the Department for Transport had not addressed the issue of using a phone while cycling. It sounds as if the wrong side of the road part was also a problem, though the rules dictating where to cycle are fairly clear. There are few words more inflammatory in the UK than “cyclists”, so I approach this with caution. But as a cyclist and a driver, I feel qualified to argue with myself about who is entitled to what space and whether the “road tax” exists. Phone usage while driving is an enormous problem and anyone who drives on a motorway regularly will notice that the tougher penalties that came in last month have done little to dissuade drivers from checking their phone while driving at 70mph. Cyclists do, on occasion, cause accidents through careless cycling, although travelling at a lower speed and weighing far less than a car means such accidents are not usually as catastrophic. It seems a bit premature to start to shift our attention to cyclists when there is still a wide perception that it’s normal to send a text from the fast lane.

4/10/2022,"Whatever Happened to Baby Jane Austen? (BBC Radio 4) | iPlayerThe Superhero Complex Novel/iHeart RadioHear Her Voice GlobalCheat! Somethin’ Else A big slice of jolliness in the Friday 11.30am slot on Radio 4 last week. Whatever Happened to Baby Jane Austen? is half an hour of cheery silliness, with Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders doing their French and Saunders thing while playing two warring sisters. French is Florence, a serious, put-upon novelist; Saunders is Selina, a blithe, grande dame actor. Florence is the Jane Austen, Selina the Baby Jane: do you see? Even if you don’t, the characters are sharply enough drawn to be understood within a couple of minutes. Last week’s opening episode (of five) had Florence trying to get Selina out of the bathroom, where she’d been for six hours. She’d worked out how to work the taps, but not the plug: “A plug? Is it an electric bath, because that sounds quite dangerous?” An old joke, sure, but still funny, especially when Saunders delivers it. David Quantick’s smooth, swift script is peppered with jokes, old and new: the sisters are both nominated for a literary prize, the Brontë Shield – the Brontës are “the Osmonds of books”; the awards’ backstage area is “just another tent. They should hold the bloody thing in Millets”; at one point, Lionel Shriver is rugby-tackled to the floor. There’s something almost old-fashioned about a radio show packed with so many gags. It reminds me of Count Arthur Strong or Ed Reardon’s Week (a compliment). Also, French and Saunders are clearly enjoying themselves. Lovely stuff. Not quite so lovely, unfortunately, is new podcast The Superhero Complex. It’s about the real-life supers who made up the Rain City Superhero Movement, a group of Seattle oddbods who, about 10 years ago, would dress up in daft costumes and go out at night to fight crime, even though nobody had actually asked them to do so. Their leader, Phoenix Jones, rocked a black all-in-one (actually a Batman outfit with the nipples shaved off), and used pepper spray and kung fu moves to stop muggers and the like. Sounds cool, if you’re five. Jones, real name Ben Fodor, got on the nerves of a lot of people, including the Seattle police. To be fair, this is a well-made show. Host David Weinberg does a top job, the production is exemplary, and the Seattle superheroes make an excellent story, well told. Sadly, however, I couldn’t completely warm to it. This is due to Jones being – how can I put this? – a birrova tosser. His pompousness and arrogance killed the podcast for me, despite all its wonderful attributes. Jones is part of a recent podcasting trend: that of the central bullshitter. Once, podcasts fell over themselves to feature serial killers; now it’s cult leaders, business phonies, rip-off merchants, ego-trumpeters. Diligent young producers track them down, try to understand their motivation, trace their family history, sift through their lies, ponder why so many people believed such self-aggrandising claptrap. All that effort! Once you’re my age, you think: “Oh God, not another one.” There’s not a woman alive who has not been bored (or worse) by a pumped-up dullard like Jones; stifled a yawn when he shows his prowess with nunchucks or peer-to-peer selling or visions for the future or whatever. I mean, yes, we all think that the police should do a better job, but no, the problems won’t be solved by a guy in a wipe-clean catsuit, no matter how many judo belts he’s got. But I’m aware that this might just be me. The Superhero Complex is destined to be a hit. A palate-cleanser after all that bumptious masculinity, Hear Her Voice is a newish podcast about women in music. Hosted by Laura Whitmore, the show can seem a little vanilla, with weirdly inappropriate background music and a middle-of-the-road script, but Whitmore’s personality is warm, she’s well informed and a good interviewer. Plus, the Guardian’s Laura Snapes is a regular, adding gravitas and credibility. The latest episode features up-and-coming artists Olivia Dean and Rio Fredrika and toddles along happily enough. There’s a Spotify playlist to hear the music that’s featured, too. Or, if you’re hooked on tossers, why not try Cheat!, a fun podcast with episodes that vary wildly in quality. The one on Bernard Tapie – possibly one of the most fascinating pan-career cheats of the past 50 years – left a lot to be desired, ending with his 1993 Marseille Champions League triumph and immediate downfall. But the two most recent episodes, about a US woman who facilitated surrogate adoption, are fascinating (and horrible). So: I’d hop around the series if I were you. And yes, I have noticed that this is yet another podcast based on self-promoting charlatans. It’s a phase, I hope. Next year, podcast-makers might move on to something – somebody – else.",Arts/Television & radio,The week in audio: Whatever Happened to Baby Jane Austen?; The Superhero Complex; Hear Her Voice; Cheat!,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/09/whatever-happened-to-baby-jane-austen-review-french-and-saunders-the-superhero-complex-hear-her-voice-laura-whitmore-cheat
4/10/2022,"Two thousand ventilators being used in UK hospitals are at risk of suddenly shutting down due to electrical faults that have led to a global safety alert. Hospitals have been ordered to source replacement ventilators after Philips Respironics said its breathing support devices could suddenly stop working, in some cases without activating a warning alarm. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said the problem related to “a number of electrical faults in the devices, which can result in an unexpected shutdown, leading to loss of ventilation”. It said there had been five reported cases of shutdowns in the UK so far, none of which involved patient harm. Globally, there have been 389 reports of failures, including one where the patient died and four where they were seriously injured. In six of the total cases, the warning alarm didn’t sound. Philips Respironics is one of several manufacturers that increased production of ventilators during the pandemic. The MHRA brought in a fast approval process for ventilators and other medical devices in response to Covid-19. The affected machines include invasive and non-invasive ventilators used to support patients in critical care and high-dependency units. The MHRA said the root cause of the problem was not yet known and remained under investigation, but that Philips Respironics currently had “no permanent solution” to correct it. The Dutch medical equipment company said it was not advising customers to remove affected devices because of the “extremely low incidence” of problems, and instead recommends steps to lower the risks, such as connecting ventilators to a remote alarm system in case the primary alarm fails. But the MHRA has ordered hospitals and healthcare providers to source alternative ventilators and train staff to use them, and said affected devices should be removed from use by the end of May. In the meantime, doctors must increase monitoring of patients and ensure a backup ventilator is always available. The regulator said hospitals would still be able to use the affected ventilators if there was a “risk of severe patient harm due to the lack of availability” but that a “thorough risk assessment must be completed and additional monitoring must be used”. “If unnoticed by healthcare professionals, ventilation failure can have a severe health impact on patients,” it said. “This can include hypoxia, which can result in long-term cognitive impairment to the patient. There is also a risk of death if a patient is without ventilation for a sustained period of time.” The safety alert comes after a string of other problems involving Philips Respironics ventilators. In January, an issue that could lead to unexpected device shutdown was reported in the US. Philips said it related to a “production issue” that involved an expired adhesive and affected only a particular batch. Shutdowns were also reported in September 2020, when a recall was issued by the MHRA, which warned that about 300 Philips ventilators in the UK were at risk of suddenly stopping working. The company said that issue related “specifically to V60 ventilators with a certain printed circuit board assembly” and could be corrected through a maintenance schedule. In June 2021, a separate alert was issued due to the degradation of foam used in some ventilators and sleep apnoea machines, which could lead to users inhaling cancer-causing chemicals. The latest safety alert relates to V60, V60 Plus and V680 Philips ventilators and affects about 105,000 devices globally, and 2,000 in the UK, Philips said. The Department of Health has made arrangements to supply replacement ventilators to hospitals that need them. Dr Ben Messer, a consultant in intensive care medicine at Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and spokesman for the British Thoracic Society, said the recall was “significant” because the devices were “very widely used in critical care units” for people with lung disease and Covid-19, particularly those who needed lots of oxygen or were being weaned off more intensive support. “It’s frustrating because they are outstanding machines,” he said. He added that trust in Philips would be dented unless the cause of the problem could be identified and corrected. “If they say, ‘No, we’re not going to fix this problem’, it’s hard to imagine that will paint Philips in a very positive light.” Helen Hughes, chief executive of the Patient Safety Learning charity, said there was a “significant patient safety concern” that some Philips devices could remain in use until replacements were sourced. Philips Respironics said safety was its “number one priority” and apologised to “any patient or healthcare provider who may have experienced any concern” as a result of the safety notice.

4/10/2022,"In 1990, Larry Towell began photographing a Mennonite family who lived in a dilapidated house down the road from him in Lambton County, Ontario. “I didn’t go looking for them,” he says. “I came across them right in my own back yard.” Mennonites are a nonconformist Christian denomination dating back to the 16th century. They have traditionally lived apart from mainstream society in self-sustaining colonies, the most conservative communities resisting all forms of modernisation, including machinery and electricity. In the long, evocative essay he wrote for his photo book, The Mennonites, first published in 2000, and now about to be reissued in reedited form, Towell describes how the members of the Old Colony sect he encountered had travelled there from a long-established community in La Batea, Mexico, in search of seasonal work in the fields and orchards of Ontario. “I liked them a lot because they seemed otherworldly and therefore completely vulnerable in a society in which they did not belong and for which they were not prepared. Because I liked them, they liked me and although photography was forbidden, they let me photograph them. That’s all there was to it.” Having befriended and gained the trust of one family, he was slowly introduced to others, sometimes taking his turn at the wheel as they travelled back and forth from Canada to Mexico. “I guess I identified with them to a degree,” Towell tells me over the phone from his home in Ontario. “They were rural, they were traditionalists and they were pacifists. They did not compromise and, because of that, they did not belong.” Kent County, Ontario,1996. Towell’s intimate black-and-white images capture the simplicity and hardship of the Mennonite way of life, the austerity of their religious beliefs echoed in the wind-whipped landscapes where they settled. Many of the people he made portraits of had never been photographed before, a testament to the bond he built with them over time. “Everyone was accepting to a degree,” he says, “but you’re not part of their community, so mostly they leave you alone.” His photographs of Mennonite families are often more redolent of life on the US prairies during the dustbowl years of the 1930s. The children, wide-eyed and tousle-haired, are dressed like their parents and grandparents in check shirts and weatherbeaten denim dungarees or long skirts and headscarves. Inside their houses, everything is spartan and functional: plain wooden chairs, handmade children’s cots, work benches and cupboards. Outside, men and women work the land, scything hay and tending to livestock, travelling to and from the fields in horse-drawn carts and squat caravans. In one arresting image, a child holds aloft a puppy next to the bleeding carcass of a newly slaughtered pig. In another, rows of young schoolgirls sit poised and attentive, chalk in hand, over slate boards. In one or two photographs, his reluctant subjects, young and old, cover their faces from the inquiring gaze of his camera. Elsewhere, though, there are traces of creeping modernity: bottles of Coca-Cola on a table top; young men passing beers to each other after a day’s work; trucks and farm machinery where, not long before, there were only scythes, horse and carts. La Batea Colony, Zacatecas, Mexico, 1999. Over the course of the 1990s, Towell photographed 23 Mennonite communities at a time of great change and upheaval. “The first time I went to Mexico, all of the communities I visited were traditional, which meant there was no electricity and no vehicles apart from tractors with steel wheels. By the time I was done, they had nearly all adapted to some degree. The evolution occurred in part because the Mennonites who came to Canada had to adapt to life there and, when they returned, they brought modernity back with them.” His images have since attained a historical resonance as a document of a people caught between adherence to their biblical beliefs and the need to change in order to survive. Chavé Colony, Campeche, Mexico, 1996. Towell now spends much of his time on his 30-hectare sharecropper farm in Lambton County. He became a photographer in 1984, having previously taught poetry and folk music, which remain abiding interests. He tells me he is about to release a triple album of original folk songs based on the places he has photographed over the last four decades, which include Nicaragua, El Salvador, Gaza and Afghanistan. When I speak to him, he is packing for a flight to Poland the following day in the hope of entering Ukraine to cover the war there. “I’m 68 and I don’t like running around much any more, but it’s in the blood,” he tells me. “I don’t have an assignment and I don’t have a plan, but we’ll see what happens when I get there. At this point, when history is upon us, that’s all you can do.” Durango Colony, Durango, Mexico, 1994. Towell sees the Mennonites project as having an affinity with another body of work he made even closer to home: The World from My Front Porch, an intimate study of family and place that was published in 2008. One of the photographs from it, Isaac’s First Swim, featured on a Canadian postage stamp in 2015. “Both series came out of the same need,” he says, “which was to document, to a degree, what was familiar. The same instinct is behind the poetry I write and the music I make.” His work, whether from the world’s conflict zones or his own locality, is characterised by deep looking and a desire to evoke the universal through the particular. “The Mennonites in my photographs originally came from Ukraine and Russia in the 19th century,” he says. “The scarves the women are wearing are from Ukraine. It’s all connected.” The Mennonites by Larry Towell is published in May by Gost (£60)",Arts/Art and design,A community out of time: Larry Towell’s images of Mennonite families,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/09/a-community-out-of-time-larry-towells-images-of-mennonite-families
4/10/2022,"The 14-year-old son of a British man is believed to have died following reports that he went missing on a diving trip in Malaysia. Adrian Chesters, 46, reportedly told the Malaysian coastguard his son Nathen, who has Dutch nationality, had died while they were adrift. Following a dive off the coast of Mersing, in the southern state of Johor, on Wednesday, the group surfaced but were unable to find their boat. Fishers spotted Chesters, along with 18-year-old French national Alexia Molina, in the waters of neighbouring Indonesia. They were rescued by marine police on Saturday after floating about 130km (80 miles) from where they had been diving, and were brought back to Malaysia. Nathen died before he could be rescued, Chesters told officials, with a coastguard statement citing the father as saying he died “as a result of being too weak … was unable to survive”. Chester and Molina were admitted to a Malaysian hospital in stable condition, according to local police. The group’s diving instructor, 35-year-old Norwegian national Kristine Grodem, was rescued on Thursday in waters off southern Malaysia. Grodem was training the other three, who were hoping to obtain advanced diving licences, maritime officials said. Grodem said they had been separated by strong currents. The Malaysian police have called off their search for the 14-year-old after they concluded he had drifted into Indonesian waters, informing their counterparts in the neighbouring country. Malaysia has used helicopters, a plane, boats, divers and jet skiers to search a vast area in recent days. The Indonesian authorities are expected to continue searching for the teenager’s body. The divers had been on an excursion close to a small island, Tokong Sanggol, about 15km off Malaysia’s south-east coast when the incident took place. After diving for about 40 minutes, the group surfaced but could not locate their boat. They became separated after drifting together in the powerful currents. The alarm was raised when they failed to return about an hour into the dive. The captain of the boat who took the group to the dive site has been detained after testing positive for drugs, police said. Diving activities off the coast of Mersing, where there are several popular diving locations, have been suspended. The incident happened days after Malaysia reopened its borders to foreign visitors on 1 April.",News/World news,"Boy, 14, missing in Malaysia diving trip believed to have died",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/09/adrian-chesters-boy-missing-in-diving-trip-malaysia-believed-dead
4/10/2022,"David de Gea labelled Manchester United a disgrace after their hopes of Champions League qualification faded with a dismal 1-0 defeat at relegation-threatened Everton. United suffered a third defeat in five matches courtesy of Anthony Gordon’s deflected goal and despite impressive contributions from the England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford they failed to test seriously an Everton defence that conceded three at Burnley in midweek. De Gea did not hold back in a scathing analysis of United’s effort, admitting they lacked the desire Everton showed in their fight to avoid a first relegation since 1951. The United goalkeeper said: “They played Wednesday and they were tired but they had more desire than us, that is not acceptable. Very sad to lose. It is a disgrace from us. We should be winning this game.” Ralf Rangnick concurred with the Spain international’s view of an unacceptable display. Pickford did not have a save to make between the 12th and 81st minute. “It is not so difficult to see that this was our biggest problem,” said the caretaker manager. “If you don’t score in 95 minutes against a team who conceded three goals against Burnley it is difficult to explain. “For us as a coaching staff it is difficult to understand why we didn’t create more chances in a game like this. The first 25 minutes we were in full control of the game. “Saying that, in those 25 minutes we didn’t take enough advantage of that dominating period, especially on our left side. I would have wished to create more overlaps and underlaps and exploit the space more than we did. “We had our moments and could have scored in the first 25 minutes but in that period of the game I would have wished us to be more penetrating. You could literally feel they were crumbling after that result against Burnley, quite logically they are not full of confidence, but we didn’t take advantage and their first shot on goal, a deflected shot, changed the game and changed the atmosphere. Second half they just defended and we were not able to break down that wall.” Rangnick denied speculation over his successor, expected to be Ajax’s Erik ten Hag, had contributed to the players’ meagre effort but admitted European qualification would be undeserved on this evidence. “I don’t see any connection between this issue and I don’t think we should allow anyone to have this alibi or excuse,” said Rangnick. “A new manager will come and it doesn’t matter if it will be announced in five, 15 or 20 days. The players should be eager to play international football and if possible Champions League football but as long as we play like today we just don’t deserve it.”",Sport/Football,"Manchester United ‘a disgrace,’ says David de Gea after defeat at Everton",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/09/manchester-united-a-disgrace-says-david-de-gea-after-everton-defeat
4/10/2022,"Regardless of how Sunday morning’s Australian Grand Prix plays out, for Lewis Hamilton just crossing the line must be counted as success. He enjoys a wide range of interests but snake-handler was surely never one he anticipated having to adopt as he wrestles with a positively venomous Mercedes that may have already cost him any hope of an eighth Formula One championship. The race in Melbourne will likely mean a continuation of the fascinating fight between the frontrunners, Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc who took pole and Red Bull’s Max Verstappen who was just behind him. In an object lesson of the travails facing Mercedes this season, Hamilton and his teammate George Russell managing fifth and sixth on the grid was considered a success. Comparatively it was, Hamilton was 16th in qualifying at the last round in Saudi Arabia. This was a small victory then but its context is what really matters for the bigger picture of the season ahead. Hamilton was still a full second off the front of the grid, moreover he had done it by wrangling his recalcitrant car on the very edge, with the constant threat it would rear up and bite him. He has been blunt about the problems facing Mercedes thus far this season but in Melbourne there was a suggestion it was almost getting personal. “The problem is when you push that car a little bit more she is quite spiteful,” he said. “She is like a viper or like a rattlesnake, you never know.” Mercedes’ issues are well documented and in Melbourne they were laid painfully bare. Their car was strong in sector one and solid in the second but in the final sector the time fell away in vast chunks, unable to attack the high-speed corners. The car is still suffering from the violent jarring known as porpoising due to a downforce stall on straights that then prevents smooth corner entry. The problem seemed exacerbated in Melbourne particularly into the turn nine-ten chicane that is now at the end of a long back straight. With two races down Hamilton is used to the experience but was illuminatingly descriptive of what this meant in the cockpit. “Basically we just have to try and find a level of the bouncing, as hardcore as we can go without rattling our brains out,” he said. Lewis Hamilton said he felt uncomfortable after members of Formula One’s ruling body failed to wear face masks during a drivers’ briefing for Sunday’s Australian Grand Prix. F1’s new race director, Niels Wittich, chaired a two-hour meeting at Melbourne’s Albert Park on Friday night where he announced a clampdown on jewellery and insisted on fireproof underwear. Under local law, it is not mandatory to wear a face mask in an enclosed space. Hamilton, speaking after he qualified fifth for the third round of the new season, said: “No one in the drivers’ briefing were wearing masks. Some of the drivers were but most of the FIA were not, which for me was uncomfortable. It was the longest drivers’ briefing of my life. I have been racing a long time and they have never done such a long briefing. “I don’t understand the small things they are picking up on, like the underwear – are we really talking about that kind of thing? But anyway you take it and move on.” Hamilton will head into Sunday’s race 29 points adrift of the championship leader, Charles Leclerc. The Ferrari driver will start from pole position, with Hamilton the best part of a second slower in his misfiring Mercedes machine. “We have not made any progress,” added the seven-time world champion. “I really hope over this next week we can get as much information and figure something out. I wish I could be optimistic and say we have got something better coming, but at the moment we don’t. Winning is a long way off, a second off, so it is a huge gap. “I don’t enjoy driving this car but I enjoy the collaboration with the guys, knowing that there is a steep hill to climb and remaining hopeful that we will get there.” PA Media The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, has been honest in his assessment of their issues but eschewing the serpent metaphor, described a “gremlin” in their car and their efforts to deal deal with it. “We need to continue to analyse and look at the data,” he said. “It’s physics not mystics.” Australia is race three of the season in what is looking like a straight fight between Ferrari and Red Bull with Leclerc and Verstappen at the sharp end. Mercedes and its drivers have maintained hope that if they solve their problems, the car will come good and potentially be very fast but after this round that prospect looks an awfully long way off. The chances of them catching the leaders are diminishing apace, as a disenchanted Hamilton admitted there was currently nothing in the pipeline to turn round their fortune. “We have not made any progress,” he said, “I wish I could be optimistic and say we have got something better coming, but at the moment we don’t. Winning is a long way off, a second off, it is a huge gap.” Wolff conceded their hopes of competing for the title had dropped to as little as 20% and even that may be optimistic should Leclerc or Verstappen extend their lead further in Melbourne. Indeed Wolff echoed Hamilton in admitting the solution could still be beyond the horizon. “I’m optimistic that eventually we will get there, whether it is two races or five, or the season,” he said. “My time horizon is not a race weekend or a year, it is more like ten years.” Two weeks lie ahead before the next round at Imola where the team must surely at least have gone some way to charming this snake if there is to be any hope of a tilt at the title.",Sport/Sport,Hamilton must charm his venomous car to save Mercedes’ F1 season | Giles Richards,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/09/lewis-hamilton-must-charm-his-venomous-car-to-save-mercedes-season
