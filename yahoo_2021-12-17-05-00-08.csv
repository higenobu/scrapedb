12/17/2021,"(Reuters) -The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday it had received reports of eight cases of myocarditis, a type of heart inflammation, in children aged 5-11 years who received Pfizer and BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine.    The CDC had previously said that reporting rates of myocarditis for boys aged 16 to 17 could be more than 69 cases per million second doses administered and around 40 cases per million second doses in boys aged 12-15 years old.    The CDC did not say whether it believes there is a link between the myocarditis cases and the vaccine, or disclose the rate of myocarditis in the age group without vaccination.    The agency said there had been over 7 million vaccine doses in the 5-11 age group at the time it examined the data, with 5.1 million first doses and 2 million second doses. The cases had a mild clinical course, the CDC said.    The cases were reported in the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and presented by the CDC to a panel of its expert advisers.    (Reporting by Manas Mishra in Bengaluru and Michael Erman in New Jersey; Editing by Shailesh Kuber) ",Health/Reuters,Eight heart inflammation cases among young kids who got COVID-19 shot - U.S. CDC,https://news.yahoo.com/eight-heart-inflammation-cases-seen-174452995.html
12/17/2021,"A group of snakes found slithering around inside the walls of a Target restroom in Pennsylvania were wrangled and removed recently. “Over the weekend we got in quite a few new patients,” the Humane Animal Rescue of Pittsburgh said in a Dec. 15 Facebook post. The rescue group said six snakes were removed from the men’s restroom inside a Target, located in Beaver County. The non-venomous DeKay’s brown snakes were brumating — the reptile equivalent of hibernating — and somehow settled on the bathroom wall as their home to ride out the winter. While the snakes are “healthy and active,” the group will be keeping them safe and warm until April, since their brumation period was interrupted. They’ll be set free just in time for mating season, the rescuers said. While the idea of snakes wriggling through the walls, particularly the walls of a restroom, is distressing to some, DeKay’s brown snakes aren’t dangerous to humans, according to the wildlife group. Besides having no venom, they typically only grow to around 19 inches in length and mostly feast on worms and slugs, the post said. ‘Thirsty’ snakes filled water well in Iowa — then unsuspecting maintenance man arrives Texas woman calls 911 after finding python on her toilet. ‘How does that even happen?’ Timber rattlesnake hitchhiked across nation and got stuck in Arizona, expert says Can you spot venomous snake in this photo?
