2/9/2022,"A young Knox County Schools student has died of complications from COVID-19. Adalyn Rita Graviss, 7, died Monday night after developing a severe neurological response to COVID-19, her mother, Jennifer Kowalski-Graviss, told Knox News. Adalyn, a second grader at Rocky Hill Elementary School, suffered from Raynaud's syndrome and her mother said doctors think COVID-19 triggered an auto-immune disorder in the child. ""She was just the best kid in the whole wide world,"" Jennifer Kowalski-Graviss said. ""Her heart was so, so big. But it just wasn't strong enough."" Adalyn had a low-grade fever Friday and then went downhill ""all of a sudden,"" Kowalski-Graves said. ""It was within hours. Her body just couldn't fight it."" She was admitted to East Tennessee Children's Hospital on Saturday night and then was transferred to Monroe Carell Jr. Children’s Hospital at Vanderbilt University in Nashville on Monday, Kowalski-Graviss said. Adalyn ""had thousands and thousands of people praying for her,"" she said. ""The whole school held prayer groups. It was so amazing. She was so loved. She lighted up everyone's life."" Described as a ""mother hen"" to all the children in the neighborhood, Adalyn had prayed for a little sister every single night for four years, her mother said. Her ""biggest dream came true"" Jan. 28, when baby sister Ella was born, said Holly Pace, who had been Adalyn's kindergarten teacher at Rocky Hill. ""She talked about it nonstop. She was so proud."" Adalyn only got to spend a few days with Ella before she got sick and had to isolate, Kowalski-Graviss said. Neighbor Deanna Ford said Adalyn was sick with a fever but was in good spirits. ""She was really fine until suddenly she wasn't,"" Ford said. ""It's really unbelievable."" Within hours of being admitted to the hospital, Adalyn was intubated, her mother said. ""They think her body was attacked,"" Kowalski-Graviss said, adding a neurologist said Adalyn developed acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, or ADEM. Known to occur more often in children, ADEM is a rare disorder that follows infections and can trigger widespread inflammation of brain and spinal cord tissues. Though the exact cause is unknown, but in severe cases, the nerve damage caused by inflammation can lead to long-term disability and death. It is known to occur more commonly in upper respiratory infections, like those that can occur with the omicron variant. Dozens of instances have been reported worldwide following COVID-19 infection. “We are deeply saddened by the sudden loss of one of our students,"" Rocky Hill Principal Tina Holt said Tuesday in a message shared with the school's parents. ""Our thoughts are with all those who are grieving, especially the Graviss family.” Counselors are available to support students and staff during this difficult time, Holt said. Adalyn's death will leave a big hole in her school and her community, said Pace. ""She was wise beyond her years,"" Pace said. ""Every kiddo (in the school) gravitated to her. She was just gentle, and had a light about her."" A fundraiser on GoFundMe established by Pace, the Adalyn Graviss Memorial Fund, already has exceeded its $15,000 goal. A Meal Train already has food organized for the family through the first week of March. The outpouring of support has been incredible, Kowalski-Graviss said. Adalyn ""touched so many lives,"" she said. ""She was the most amazing girl with the biggest heart. That kid deserved the world."" The Knox County Health Department said Tuesday this is the first pediatric death in Knox County related to COVID-19. Reporters Vincent Gabrielle and Becca Wright contributed to this story.

2/9/2022,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — The cost to build California's ambitious but long delayed high-speed rail line has once again risen, with rail officials now estimating it could take up to $105 billion to finish the line from San Francisco to Los Angeles. The new cost estimates, released Tuesday as part of the California High Speed Rail Authority's biennial business plan, are up roughly $5 billion from two years ago. The increases are due in part to new commitments aimed at minimizing community disruption, such as building enhanced noise barriers and distancing the train from the Cesar E. Chavez National Monument in the Central Valley, project officials said. The project's price tag has steadily risen since voters first approved nearly $10 billion in bond money for it in 2008, when the total cost was pegged at $40 billion. In the years since, the costs have kept climbing amid struggles to obtain the necessary land and other delays. The first part of the line will run through the Central Valley; construction is underway, but no track has yet been laid. Chief Executive Officer Brian Kelly said Tuesday the possibility of a fresh infusion of cash from the federal government puts the project on a stronger path. California should be in a good position to compete for as much as $6 billion in grant money under the federal infrastructure bill Congress passed last year. During the Obama administration, California won roughly $3 billion for the project, then former Republican President Donald Trump revoked about $1 billion of that. It's been returned by the Biden administration. Receiving billions more in federal dollars would allow the project's first operational track to be a double track, not a single one, and help the project move forward on design and other work, Kelly said. “We just think that this is a great opportunity to really move the project forward,"" he said. Still, the project faces challenges. Last year, the state Legislature did not agree to Gov. Gavin Newsom's budget request to release $4.2 billion that's left in the voter-approved bond fund for the project. Democratic leaders in the state Assembly have been hesitant to release the money due to skepticism about the project's overall approach and lack of sustained funding. Newsom, a Democrat, proposed releasing the money again in his January budget proposal. His spokespeople did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the status of the negotiations.",U.S./Associated Press,Costs climb again for California's high-speed rail project,https://news.yahoo.com/costs-climb-again-californias-high-232647725.html
2/9/2022,"Donald Trump, the American president from 2017 to 2021, said he knew more about trade than most economists and foreign-policy experts. “Trade wars are good, and easy to win,” Trump famously declared in 2018. He described himself as a “Tariff Man” and proved it by imposing new tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. imports, to be paid by the American firms buying those goods. Trump’s dubious logic was that making imports costlier to Americans would hurt the foreign sellers and give him leverage he could use to demand concessions. His biggest target, of course, was China. Trump added new tariffs on about $450 billion worth of U.S. imports from China, while China, predictably, retaliated with similar penalties on U.S. imports. The escalation rattled financial markets in 2018 and 2019 and ultimately led to the “Phase One” trade deal between the two countries, signed on Jan. 15, 2020. Under that deal, China would sharply increase its purchases of U.S. goods as a precondition for Trump (or his successor) removing the new tariffs and getting back to normal. New trade data for 2021 shows that China came nowhere near fulfilling its commitments in the 2020 phase one deal, with U.S. exporters ending up worse off than they would have been had Trump done nothing on trade. Analysis of trade data by Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics found that during the first two years covered by the trade deal—2020 and 2021—China purchased just 57% of what it had committed to in the trade deal. China said it would buy at least $502 billion of U.S. goods during those two years. Yet total purchases added up to just $289 billion. If there had been no Trump trade war, and no tariffs, U.S. exports to China would have been $119 billion more than actual levels from 2018-2021, if the U.S. share of Chinese imports had simply remained constant. That's a net loss of business for American companies. And it doesn’t include nearly $30 billion in U.S. taxpayer funds Trump doled out to farmers to compensate them for lost sales to China from 2018 through 2020. [Get Rick Newman’s stories by email or follow him on Twitter.] “Two years ago, President Donald Trump signed what he called a ‘historical trade deal’ with China,” Bown wrote on the the Peterson Institute’s website. “Today the only undisputed ‘historical’ aspect of that agreement is its failure. Was the trade war worth it for U.S. exporters? The answer so far is no.” The COVID pandemic obviously interfered with trade between the United States and China, as it did with trade between most nations. But that doesn’t appear to be the main reason China’s purchases of U.S. exports are so far below what they agreed to. Total U.S. exports of goods and services are nearly back to pre-pandemic levels, and exports of goods alone hit record levels in 2021. That reflects COVID-related distortions in the economy as a whole, with a cutback in services such as travel boosting demand for goods. U.S. exporters are producing much more than before COVID—just not for the Chinese market. The 2020 Trump deal focused on four areas where China was supposed to bulk up on American purchases and ultimately boost U.S. employment in those fields: Manufacturing, agriculture, energy and services. The shortfall in services, including travel and education, clearly suffered from COVID. But that was less than 20% of the total purchase commitment. Agriculture involved the smallest commitment by China, and those exports rose the most of any of the four groups. But that followed a swine fever crisis in China that gutted domestic pork production and led to a surge in imports from many places. While Chinese food purchases rose following the 2020 deal, they still fell far short of what China pledged to buy from American farmers. U.S. automotive and aircrafts exports to China are actually lower than they were in 2017, which is the baseline year for calculating China’s increased purchase commitments. That’s partly due to the shortage of semiconductors for automobiles and to the fiasco with Boeing’s 737 Max airliner, which scotched sales for months. Yet critics ripped the 2020 deal at the time of its signing for prescriptive purchase targets allowing little to no flexibility for externalities—such as a pandemic or a blockage in one particular sector. Those critics turned out to be right. The phase one deal had no enforcement mechanism, and Trump is obviously not president any more. So there may be no consequences of China missing the deal’s targets by a wide margin. President Biden, for his part, has been cagey about his China trade policy. He has left most of the Trump tariffs on Chinese imports in place, while removing many other tariffs, such as those Trump imposed on European allies. Biden places more importance on human rights and green energy than Trump did, and it’s possible he could link the removal of tariffs to Chinese action in those areas. The one thing that’s clear from Trump’s wayward trade experiment, however, is that is makes no sense to hurt yourself in order to hurt somebody else.
