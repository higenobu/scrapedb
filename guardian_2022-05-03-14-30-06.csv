5/3/2022,"Average temperatures are set to drop by 5-6C in some parts of Australia’s eastern states this week as “polar cold” sweeps north from Tasmania and up to Queensland. The cold front will spread through Victoria and the western and southern parts of New South Wales midweek, hitting western Queensland by Thursday. It will then move to south-east Queensland and north-east NSW by early next week, resulting in a 3-4C drop below-average temperature in this region. “It’s across a broad area where everyone will think ‘oh, it’s almost winter’,” said Helen Reid, a meteorologist at the Bureau of Meteorology. “Queensland won’t have that same sense of polar cold as Victoria and NSW but it will definitely be a shift and will be a more noticeable thing in the western part of the state.” Reid said Queensland can expect to experience intrusions of polar air from the southern states a few more times before the state settles into a drier winter. The first dusting of snow may also hit mountain peaks this week in the high country of Tasmania, Victoria, and southern NSW, Reid said. The snow forecast for this winter will be modelled by BoM around the end of May. In anticipation of a good snow season, Rhylla Morgan from Mt Buller resort said it has had some of the highest levels and earliest bookings they’ve seen on record. She said colleagues from other resorts were reporting the same thing. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Morgan said they’re looking forward to it being open for the whole season after the pandemic-related lockdowns disrupted the past two seasons. “If you’re wanting to come here you need to make a plan and start to book that now,” she said. The cold front will bookend what has been a wetter than average April with Australia receiving 27% above average rainfall, according to the BoM’s weather summary. April also retains the crown for 2022 as the wettest year on record in Sydney. Rainfall for April was above average for most of the eastern half of Australia, with significant flooding in some parts. NSW received 51% above-average rainfall, and Queensland recorded 68%, the ninth-wettest recorded April in both states. Australia’s mean temperature for April was 1.61C warmer than the 1961–1990 average, the seventh-highest on record for April. Meanwhile, maximum temperatures in April were the highest on record across the base of Northern Territory’s Top End, and in parts of northern Kimberley. According to BoM’s latest climate driver update, the 2021–22 La Niña event is weakening. But there are signs that a negative phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole in May – the difference in sea surface temperature between the western and eastern areas of the Indian Ocean – will increase the chances of above-average rainfall through winter and spring.",News/Australia news,Temperatures to drop in eastern Australia as ‘polar cold’ sweeps north ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/03/temperatures-to-drop-in-eastern-australia-as-polar-cold-sweeps-north
5/3/2022,"The Victorian government will spend $12bn to repair its Covid-battered health system with the treasurer, Tim Pallas, confident that the worst of the pandemic is behind the state and a return to surplus will happen in the near future. Pallas’s eighth budget, handed down on Tuesday, includes $2.9bn worth of new health infrastructure. This includes $900m to build a hospital in Melton, in Melbourne’s west, which will include a 24-hour emergency department and an intensive care unit, along with maternity and mental health services. About $500m will be spent on Barwon Women’s and Children’s hospital in Geelong, for new operating theatres and expanded paediatric and maternity units, while $300m will go to a fund for regional hospitals and $236m to double capacity at Casey and Mercy hospitals. About $4.2bn will be spent to support the state’s pandemic response, including $522m for hospitals treating Covid-19 patients, $1.1bn to purchase and distribute free rapid antigen tests to schools, hospitals and people with a disability, $284m for personal protective equipment and $258m to vaccinate Victorians against Covid. A previously announced, $1.5bn will be spent to help the state reduce its elective surgery waiting list, which is approaching 90,000 patients. The government is also expanding its hospital-at-home program – of which the premier, Daniel Andrews, was a patient when he suffered a back injury last year – at a cost of almost $700m. An unprecedented 7,000 healthcare workers will be hired and trained, including 5,000 nurses and 400 triple-zero call takers. This comes after several Victorians have died while waiting to be connected to triple-zero. Emergency departments have also been crowded with patients whose care has been delayed due to successive periods of lockdown and two years of Covid-19 restrictions. In his speech to state parliament, Pallas thanked the state’s nurses, doctors, paramedics and healthcare workers, who “set a powerful example of compassion and selflessness right throughout the pandemic”, treating thousands of patients, administering 15m vaccine doses and 20m PCR tests. “They fought a threat from which they were not immune, facing exposure and isolation, and taking on extra work when colleagues were furloughed,” he said. “Today, we say thank you. “Today I hand down a budget that gives our healthcare workers the extra pair of helping hands they need – so they can give Victorians the very best care.” Other big-ticket items include $2.6bn for the Commonwealth Games, to be held in regional Victoria in 2026, $1.8bn to deliver new schools and upgrade existing schools and $779m to recruit 1,900 teachers, as well as $1bn as part of a partnership with the community housing sector to create a further 6,000 social and affordable homes. The government is also set to spend $21.3bn a year on infrastructure over the next four years. The treasurer said the construction sector was “demonstrating signs of stress” thanks to shortages of skilled workers and materials, with the government likely to alter its scheduling of future builds. The budget revealed the cost of the government’s major projects have blown out by 4% since last year’s budget – costing $5.8bn – with Pallas largely blaming the beleaguered West Gate Tunnel project. Projects are also taking 20% longer to complete than outlined last year. But the treasurer is optimistic about the state’s future, describing the two years of economic pain as largely over, with recovery already under way. “We were confident of a quick bounceback but I’m pleased to say it’s been even faster than we predicted,” he said. “Victorians are crowding back to jobs, restaurants, theatres and stadiums. Business conditions are well above their long-term average. Leading employment indicators are strong.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Pallas has forecast a $7.9bn deficit in 2022-23 – $2.6bn higher than projected in the December budget update – shrinking to $3.3bn in 2023-24 and $1.1bn in 2024-25, before a predicted $650m surplus in 2025-26. An operating cash surplus of $1.3bn is also forecast in 2022-23, growing to $5.5bn in 2025-26. The budget shows the state performed better than expected during the current financial year, recording a deficit of $17.6bn in 2021-22 – $1.9bn lower than forecast in the update. This is despite the emergence of the Delta variant of Covid-19, which forced Melbourne and other parts of Victoria into lockdown. The state’s economy grew by 5.5% in 2021-22, which is double the 2.25% forecast in December’s update. The economy is forecast to continue to grow by 3.25% next financial year, and then 2.25% in 2023-24, and 2.75% in each of the following two years. Employment growth is expected to reach 1.75% in the next financial year and 1% in 2023-24, before rising to 1.75% in 2025-26. Victoria’s unemployment stands at a record low of 4%, with the regional unemployment rate at 3.2% – almost a full percentage point lower than the national average of 4.2%. The participation rate is close to record levels. The Victorian economy is expected to be 8.7% bigger at the end of 2021-22 than it was in 2018-19 – the last full financial year before the pandemic. But the state’s debt, which has ballooned due to Covid-19 and infrastructure spending, is expected to reach $101.9bn in June this year, growing to $167.5bn, or 26.5% of gross state product. Pallas said despite this, interest expense as a share of total revenue will remain “modest” at 6% a year over the forward estimates – “well below the levels seen during the 1990s”. This factors in expected interest rate rises. The government is also establishing the Victorian future fund, using proceeds from the privatisation of VicRoads number plate and registration services and yet-to-be-announced land sales to repay Covid borrowings. The fund is projected to have a balance of about $10bn in the medium term, with more details expected to be announced in July. “I’ve been particularly cryptic about this for a very good reason – we’re in the process of a tender process at the moment,” Pallas told reporters. “I will be able to tell everybody exactly how much we’ve got for that once that tender process is completed.” Employee expenses are forecast to grow to $37.5bn in 2022-23, reflecting the government’s significant response to Covid in 2021-22. The Treasury expects expenditure will fall by almost 10% in the coming financial year as pandemic support initiatives come to an end. There are no new savings decisions in the budget but previously announced reviews of government departments – expected to save the government $1.7bn – are moving ahead.

House prices are expected to fall by 4% in the 2023 calendar year. Pallas also used the budget to take aim at the Morrison government for “short-changing” Victorians, citing the federal budget, which allocated the state just 6% of infrastructure funding, despite having 26% of the nation’s population. Victoria was also the only state left out of its $7bn regional economies fund. When the current GST deal expires in 2027, Pallas said the state would also lose $1bn each year. “The commonwealth government, whoever they are, must stop short-changing hard-working Victorians and give us our fair share,” he told parliament. “As the premier has said, funding Victoria fairly is not foreign aid – this is simply what Victorians are entitled to, as Australians. Our federation won’t function effectively if the commonwealth disappears in our hour of need and treats Victorians as second-class citizens.” Victoria is set to go to the polls on 26 November, with the budget setting the scene for a battle between the Labor government and the Coalition opposition over health. The opposition leader, Matthew Guy, said the problems with Victoria’s health system existed before the pandemic, with the state running the “lowest-funded, poorest-staffed and worst-performing emergency departments in the nation”. “Victorians deserve better than a premier more concerned with repairing his personal brand than repairing local communities,” he said. “How can you trust the government that got us into this mess to be the ones to get us out of it?”",News/Australia news,Victoria’s treasurer delivers health-focused budget and promises return to surplus,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/03/victorias-treasurer-hands-down-health-focused-budget-with-a-promise-of-a-return-to-surplus
5/3/2022,"Julie Finch has been appointed CEO of the Hay festival and will succeed founder and former director Peter Florence, who resigned from his role after a bullying claim was upheld last year. The prestigious literary festival, now in its 35th year, selected the former CEO of the Cheltenham Trust for the role after “an extensive nationwide recruitment process”. Finch has more than 20 years of experience in the cultural and creative sectors, most recently as CEO-director of Compton Verney Art Gallery and Park. Hay festival chair Caroline Michel said the board of directors were “delighted” to appoint Finch, and “welcome her vast experience”. She went on to praise Finch’s “proven track record of strong leadership, effective strategy development and widening cultural participation”, citing the appointment as “a thrilling new chapter for Hay festival”. This news marks a fresh start for the festival, which has suffered blows to its reputation in recent years. As well as the bullying claims against Florence, curator Caitlin McNamara alleged in 2020 that she was sexually assaulted in the United Arab Emirates when setting up a Hay Festival-branded event there.Finch, who describes herself as a “Hay festival regular”, is looking forward to taking the festival in a new direction. She said in a statement that she hopes to “reimagine the role a festival can play in our cultural landscape and contemporary society” and “plot a future that’s both daring and sustainable”. She will be taking up her position in August.

5/3/2022,"These are worrying times for Claire Tasker’s jewellery business. With soaring living costs putting acute pressure on households across the country, the Hertfordshire-based goldsmith has seen first-hand how consumers are cutting back. “If people haven’t got money to spend then it’s items like mine they’re not really going to think about buying any more,” says the small business owner, who sells her handmade fine jewellery from her home studio in Hitchin. It’s not only that sales are under pressure. The cost of gold, silver, copper and gems used to make her wares has risen dramatically, too. “I can’t see it getting any better,” Tasker says. “The cost of living is affecting me, too. There’s the stress of trying to make money, and it’s worrying being self-employed. You don’t have a steady income.” What Tasker is experiencing in Hitchin is a microcosm of the broader economy. Inflation has been rising since last summer and there were already signs of the post-Covid recovery faltering even before Vladimir Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine. The economy expanded by only 0.1% in February and retail sales fell by more than expected in March. In April, cost of living pressures intensified. The average energy bill has increased by £700 a year; Rishi Sunak has raised taxes; motoring costs have gone up. The biggest squeeze on living standards since the 1950s has resulted in consumers becoming gloomier and far less willing to spend in the shops. As far as experts are concerned, the question is not whether the economy will slow down but whether it is time to start mentioning the R word: recession. David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee, is in no doubt. “Every piece of evidence suggests that recession is coming,” he says. The prospect of the UK suffering two consecutive quarters of negative output – the technical definition of a recession – was certainly not considered likely by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) when it prepared the forecasts for the chancellor’s spring statement. While noting the headwinds facing consumers, the OBR said growth would be 3.8% this year. The International Monetary Fund’s latest world economic outlook predicted growth of 3.7% – the joint-strongest in the G7 group of industrialised nations. The OBR and the IMF forecast a marked slowdown in 2023 but the bad economic news has arrived sooner than expected. Even economists less gloomy than Blanchflower accept that the risks of a recession have risen in recent months. Deutsche Bank says the odds of an economic downturn now stand at close to one in three. With inflation likely to remain higher for longer, the pressure on households to retrench will increase over the summer. For many consumers it will feel like a recession even if the official data says otherwise. If the economy does slip into recession, the Treasury and the Bank of England will be blamed for making policy errors. A Treasury spokesperson said: “We’re continuing to support the economy now. We’re providing a £22bn package to ease pressures on households this year and helping businesses, including through a tax cut worth up to £1,000 for half a million small businesses.” Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, says Sunak blundered by not doing more in his spring statement to shield consumers from the economic storm that was coming. “The UK economy has already been put through the wringer by the chancellor’s failure to boost businesses and set out a real plan for growth. Now we are looking at another year of falling living standards and paltry growth,” she said. Labour is calling for the government to hold an emergency budget to head off the mounting economic risks. With local elections this week, the soaring cost of living could come with a heavy price for the Conservatives. Reeves said comments made by Sunak that it was “silly” to expect more support showed the party was out of touch. “We are the only major economy raising taxes on people in the midst of a cost of living crisis and that is a choice that will make conditions far worse for families already feeling the crunch.” The Treasury rejects the charge that it has been asleep at the wheel, pointing out that investment will be boosted this year by the super-deduction tax break, and that the spring statement included tax breaks and a cut in excise duty for motorists. Even so, Sunak’s popularity has waned as the cost of living crisis has deepened. Consumer spending could be propped up by more than £200bn of savings built up by households in the pandemic. However, the savings glut was mostly concentrated among the top 40% richest in society, while lower-income households lost money. While average wages are not expected to keep pace with inflation, those in the public sector and precarious zero-hours jobs are expected to lose the most ground this year. The Bank of England’s monetary policy committee is expected to respond to an annual inflation rate of 7% – the highest in 30 years – by this week raising interest rates for a fourth successive meeting. The City expects a quarter-point increase on Thursday to 1% – the highest level since immediately after the 2008 financial crisis. The Bank wants to prevent persistently high inflation from taking root but economists warn there is a risk that increasing borrowing costs will add to the problems facing business and households when the economy is already faltering. Of the five tightening cycles in the UK since the late-1970s, four ended in recession. “By focusing on containing any second-round effects on wages and prices, the Bank risks tipping the economy into recession,” said Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics. Although he expects Threadneedle Street to raise interest rates to as high as 3% by 2023, a severe downturn could force it to move more slowly. “A mild recession and/or modest fall in house prices may not deter the Bank too much if price pressures remain strong. But if the economy and/or housing market is weaker than we expect, the Bank may not raise interest rates as far,” he said. Stephen King, a senior economic adviser at HSBC, said central banks had been caught out by rising inflation and there was still an assumption that it would come back to target with only modest increases in interest rates. “History suggests that once you have got an inflation problem there is quite a lot of economic pain you have to go through to get rid of it,” King added. For Tasker, the situation is complicated by Brexit, as higher shipping costs and delays make it harder to sell to customers in the EU. During the coronavirus pandemic she had benefited from booming domestic demand, although that is drying up. “I’ve seen a drop in sales since the news announced there would be energy price increases. It’s not just me, it’s across the Facebook groups I’m in with people that have small businesses,” she said. “If people aren’t spending, businesses will close. I’m not sure that’s helpful for the economy at all.” Worries over the global economy have also risen this week, with data showing eurozone manufacturing output growth stalled in April, while China’s factory activity contracted at a steeper pace as Covid-19 lockdowns hit industrial production and disrupted supply chains. The world’s biggest economy unexpectedly shrank in the first quarter. GDP fell 0.4% amid a weaker contribution from trade and lower government spending as Covid relief was wound down. Inflation has hit 8.5%, the highest in four decades, putting pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. Growth slowed to 0.2% in January-March, from 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2021. Germany recovered from a contraction in the final months of last year but the French economy stalled, Italy shrank and Spanish growth slowed. Experts warn the region is at heightened risk of inflation and economic slowdown from tensions with Russia amid the war in Ukraine, because of the reliance on gas imports. The world’s second largest economy is under pressure as Beijing’s zero-Covid policy has led to major cities being locked down in an attempt to contain the spread of Omicron, weighing on factory output and consumer spending. The impact is expected to ripple through global supply chains, hitting activity in other countries. GDP grew 1.3% in the first quarter. Russia is expected to fall into a deep recession this year and next as sweeping western sanctions imposed after Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine have an impact upon economic activity. GDP is forecast to fall by between 8% and 10% in 2022, the biggest annual drop since immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s. Inflation is expected to hit as much as 23%.",News/Business,‘I can’t see it getting any better’: could the UK be heading for a recession?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/03/could-uk-be-heading-for-a-recession
5/3/2022,"In its 66 years of broadcasting, the Eurovision Song Contest has usually provided joy, hilarity and songs involving puppets of Irish turkeys. Set up with the noble intention of showing that music could unite Europe, it has instead been a glorious failure, with knock-off Slipknots, tone-deaf, bread-baking grannies and Israeli rappers squawking like chickens all emphasising, if anything, the impenetrability of a foreign nation’s favourite pop music – even when they’re singing in English. Just in case you were wondering, after watching the performances, whether the continent’s borders were tumbling, outrageously partisan national voting usually confirms that the spirit of intercontinental togetherness is a mirage. Greece and Cyprus give one another douze points, the Scandinavian countries vote for each other, and poor old Eurosceptic Britain has spent most of the last decade in the bottom three places. This year, however, things might be different. While nations competing in Eurovision have been at war before – bloody border disputes have erupted between Armenia and Azerbaijan for years, while Russia attacked Georgia in 2008 and invaded the Crimea region in 2014 – this time the mood against Russian’s invasion of Ukraine is resolute. After initially saying that Russia could compete, since the contest was apolitical, the organisers reversed their decision and banned the country. “If they had been allowed to enter Eurovision this year, it would have symbolised the support of Russia’s actions,” says Oleh Psiuk, frontman of this year’s Ukrainian entry, folk-tinged hip-hop crew, Kalush Orchestra. “But now, I have the feeling of justice.” For Psiuk and the rest of his six-man crew, this year’s song contest represents a unique opportunity. In the midst of an unprecedented threat to European security, he also sees an unprecedented desire for the continent to bond together. “I really believe that unity is important at the moment,” he explains via Zoom from the hotel room he’s staying in during a pre-contest promotional tour of Israel. “Our song has managed to unite so many Ukrainians and I hope that it will unite Europeans – and maybe the whole world.” Back in February, Psiuk came second in his country’s Eurovision selection process with Stefania, a musical tribute to his mother. Then, in a surprise twist, following the withdrawal of the first-placed act due to an alleged visit to the Russian-occupied region of Crimea, he found out he was going to represent Ukraine in this year’s competition, which takes place in Turin, Italy. At which point, Russia invaded his nation, his song was adopted by his compatriots as a homage to their motherland, and now it soundtracks about 150,000 TikTok clips, from videos of worldwide #Standwithukraine protests to footage of rocket launchers being fired from buildings. The groundswell of support around the act has seen the Ukrainian government grant them a special permit to travel to Italy, despite initial fears they’d have to perform via video link from a secure bunker, as a result of laws preventing young men from leaving the country. Kalush are now the overwhelming favourite to win this year’s competition – with the majority of the continent looking set to use their vote to make a statement about Russia’s aggression. “It gives me a good feeling – it’s a nice thing to know,” says Psiuk – not that he thinks the Russian invasion is entirely responsible for his entry’s popularity. “Even before the war, our song was in the top five according to the bookies. This situation that has happened may have influenced the way that we have raced to the first position in the odds, but the fact is that we have a very good song – a great song, in fact.” This is unprecedented territory for a contest that has previously had an extremely uneasy relationship with inter-European politics. For years, Eurovision’s organisers, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), have maintained that it is an intrinsically anti-political spectacle – and have repeatedly stepped in to stifle the expression of opinions that challenge such a claim. With the benefit of hindsight, it’s notable that these were often protest songs about Russian hostility towards its neighbours. The EBU banned the 2009 Georgia entry, We Don’t Wanna Put In for its less than subtle dig at Russia’s then prime minister, following the Russo-Georgian war. It had “anti-booing technology” installed to prevent the worldwide audience hearing the crowd’s protests against Russia’s 2015 entrant, following the Crimean invasion. And while, in 2016, it allowed Ukraine to enter a controversial competition-winning song about Russia’s deportation of the Crimean Tatar population in the second world war, the broadcasters were quick to condemn Ukraine as host the following year, when the country stopped the Russian contestant Yulia Samoilova from travelling to the final in 2017 due to claims she had “illegally” entered Crimea. Which the BBC’s Moscow correspondent suggested was possibly deliberate Russian provocation, or “precisely what Moscow wanted when it chose Samoilova, knowing that she had travelled to Crimea”. It also puts Kalush Orchestra in a difficult position when it comes to articulating their feelings about their country’s plight. Just to travel to Eurovision this year, Psiuk has had to step away from the 35-person volunteering organisation he set up to provide access to safe accommodation, transport and medicine for refugees. Kalush Orchestra have had to find a replacement for a band member who is fighting in the Kyiv defence forces. But the band are driven by feelings that they had “an important mission” to raise awareness for their country – a feeling Psiuk has turned into something that sounds incredibly like a continent-rousing post-Eurovision acceptance speech. “I have a message that I would like to deliver,” Psiuk says. “There are people who may see this conflict as a kind of a war film – something that is really far away and something that cannot happen to them. But it has already happened to us. We didn’t believe it beforehand, but it has actually happened,” he urges passionately. “When you wake up every morning to the sound of explosions, when you wake up without being sure if your girlfriend or family are alive, this is scary – really scary. So I would like to urge everyone to support Ukraine, to find the time to think about what they can do to help Ukraine in this situation. If everyone in the whole world does what they can, then we can end this war much sooner – and prevent it happening again in another country.” Nonetheless, even if Ukraine were to win, Psiuk’s not sure that the rules around overtly political statements would ever allow him to actually say these words. “We want to avoid any kind of politicisation, and that is why we would first of all discuss it with the team before doing anything,” he explains. Another big question lies around what the distribution of votes might look like this year. In a continent that’s being swept by a new spirit of collaboration, might we see a shakeup of the entrenched system of douze points allocation? Could there be an end to the Scandi, Balkan and ex-Soviet voting blocs? Apparently so, given the UK’s prospects. We look set to finish in the top 10 for the first time in 13 years – after having been the bottom-placed nation for the last two. Sam Ryder, the TikTok star who is this year’s entry, is currently fourth favourite to win, hopefully bringing an end to the years’ of UK complaints about political voting by the likes of ex-contestant Simon Webbe, who explained his sluggish pop stomper’s 11th-place finish in 2011 with: “It’s often not really about the song, but who your neighbours are.” There is, of course, a limit. It might be a bit much to expect Turkey and Greece to end the culture war they’ve been fighting over the ownership of Cyprus via the Eurovision voting board for four decades. And given that in 2009, Azerbaijani state police rounded up citizens who had voted for Armenia, it seems unlikely that every country’s citizens will be voting with their musical taste alone. But, for Psiuk, there’s a feeling that this contest might represent a once-in-a-generation chance to rethink petty European rivalries and for the continent to come together through song like never before. “For Ukraine, this is the most important year ever for Eurovision. And I would really like it to be true for the whole world as well, he says, as he prepares to end the Zoom call. “That’s why we’re bringing the world a message I would put in one word: love.” It’s a lovely reminder of the competition’s importance, but one that’s not surprising. After all, in the middle of a country torn apart by war, the feeling that they’re backed by their neighbours might be the most important thing they could possibly dream of. Well, almost. “Most of all we would like to have victory at the main frontline. But at this moment, any victory is meaningful and important.” Luckily, Eurovision voters can make at least one of these things happen this year.

Answer: no more so than I would like to imagine necessary to soften us up for her husband David’s drowning in a pit of effluent, a development for which I have long hankered. Sadly this now seems unlikely, as Brookfield is investing in a cover for its slurry store. Do most listeners mentally, if not actually, tune out during these patently dull “farming bits” the Ministry of Agriculture once levered into proceedings? Back in the day, they were the pedagogical pill for which the rural adultery, mutual loathing, etc, were merely the sweeteners. I admit I find them marvellously soothing. The real story of The Archers, however, may be about the characters’ relentless pursuit of sugary baked goods: faced with Natasha’s gestational diabetes, her parents-in-law, Tony and Pat, have decided to “have an affair” with puddings, setting forth for secret cheesecake in the Orangery at Lower Loxley and clandestine sticky toffee pudding at the Feathers. “The world’s our rum baba,” claimed Tony, inaccurately: as we all know, there’s a mystery forcefield preventing him from leaving Borsetshire at all. When someone asked Kathy Perks whether you can get Radio Borsetshire in Hereford, the answer should have been a resounding no, just like you can’t get Radio Brigadoon in Perth. Yes, Kathy Perks! After years of silence, the manager of Grey Gables is audible again – revealed as the mystery wearer of the Easter bunny costume who, face it, was never going to be Rob Titchener returned in disguise to abduct little Jack, though that would have been quite exciting. She’s reappeared just in time for Oliver and his new business partner, Adil, to pull a P&O and make the entire workforce of Grey Gables redundant without a statutory consultation period. It had to happen: the fabled gables were increasingly, well, grey and, by the sounds of it, peeling. It seems it’s going to be renovated for a year and reopened as a slightly less terrible hotel. I would have thought a different business might provide more plot opportunities. Nuclear power station, à la Springfield? Young offenders’ unit? Asylum seekers’ “reception centre”? That would be nicely topical, what with the real-life plans to establish “Guantánamo-on-Ouse” in a bucolic Yorkshire village. Ruairi has come back from university – in an eyebrow-raisingly implausible twist – on the game, or at least being kept in expensive booze and holiday flats by one Julianne, a loaded older woman.

5/3/2022,"An NHS ambulance service is cutting back its presence at Gatwick airport and major sports events so it has more crews available to answer 999 calls, amid unprecedented pressures. The South East Coast ambulance service (Secamb) has ended a longstanding arrangement under which Gatwick paid it to have an ambulance car and paramedic on site. It has also decided to limit the number of ambulances and paramedics on standby to deal with medical emergencies at Premier League club Brighton and Hove Albion’s Amex Stadium and Goodwood racecourse in West Sussex. It may do the same in other places. Secamb’s move has prompted speculation that other ambulance services may reduce or end resources at mass spectator events and focus on “core” work. England’s 10 regional ambulance services are under pressure to speed up response times, which have been growing across England, and tackle the growing number of patients who have to wait hours for a crew to arrive, despite in some cases suffering a life-threatening emergency. For many years Gatwick paid Secamb to have an ambulance car and paramedic at the airport, providing medical cover at both its terminals. The arrangement ended in 2020 when the Covid pandemic saw passenger numbers plummeting. With more people travelling again, Gatwick wanted to restart the service but Secamb declined, citing the need to concentrate on providing speedy care for the population it serves across Kent, Surrey, Sussex and north-east Hampshire. Secamb confirmed it was examining the level of cover it provided at mass gatherings and events in stadiums to concentrate on improving its response times to 999 calls. It now only has one ambulance and one member of staff on duty at the Amex Stadium. Sources at Secamb said organisations affected by its rethink would have to increase private medical cover from other providers. “Recognising the challenges that we, along with other ambulance trusts, are facing currently, we are reviewing the private medical cover contracts we have to ensure we provide a fair and equitable service to all, regardless of where people are in our region,” a trust spokesperson said. “We will be keeping the matter under review and would like to reassure anyone attending the locations affected by these changes that they will continue to receive emergency medical help if needed.” The Unison union, which represents 400,000 NHS staff including ambulance personnel, backed Secamb’s move. “Football grounds and racecourses should be providing their own medical cover on site, freeing up hard-pressed crews to focus on 999 callers in desperate need of their help,” said Josh Cooper, Unison’s south-east regional organiser. “Before the pandemic, less stretched ambulance services often provided cover for sports events. But now the system is under such intense strain they can barely cover emergency calls, let alone anything else.” One Secamb paramedic claimed that the loss of the Gatwick ambulance car would prove counterproductive, as the service now has to send personnel to every emergency. Speaking anonymously, the paramedic said: “Most of the jobs at the airport were falls, drunks and minor wounds, so they could either be dealt with and sent off on holiday or asked to get a cab to the local hospital without the use of an ambulance. Now the airport will call 999 and an ambulance will have to attend, adding to workload.” He said that on a recent Saturday evening Secamb had to dispatch an ambulance to Gatwick after each of four different calls, which turned out to be all about the same medical situation. “If the ‘Gatso’ ambulance care had still been there then the four jobs could have been dealt with by whoever was on duty.” NHS England declined to comment.",News/Society,NHS ambulance service cuts presence at Gatwick airport and sports venues,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/03/nhs-ambulance-service-cuts-presence-at-gatwick-airport-and-sports-venues
5/3/2022,"Inflation, a Covid comeback, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Josh Frydenberg “short-changing” his home state – these are the major battles Victoria’s treasurer, Tim Pallas, faces as he plots a narrow course towards a small budget surplus within four years’ time. To fight his way back to surplus, Pallas is relying on economic growth – fuelled by the state’s speedy bounceback from a Covid-19 recession and a full-to-overflowing $21bn-a-year infrastructure pipeline, which itself contains significant potential pitfalls – rather than cutting spending or increasing taxes. He is optimistic about the state’s economy. But, as is always the case with budgets and battles, his plans risk running into an uncooperative reality. Pallas forecasts Victorian inflation of 3% this year, falling to as low as 2.25% by 2023-24, which seems a big call given the shock national figure of 5.1% announced by the Bureau of Statistics last week. He reckons the bigger number “wouldn’t have had a profound effect on the fiscal aggregates”, but the budget papers call out the risk of higher inflation in the future feeding into higher interest rates, which could reduce consumer spending. However, rate rises this year are already baked into the budget – “the market has already moved,” Pallas told reporters at the budget lockup on Tuesday. Just as well – an hour and a half after Pallas rose in Victorian parliament to give his budget speech, the Reserve Bank increased official rates by 25 basis points, moving from a record low of 0.1% to 0.35%. Victoria’s Treasury predicts home prices will fall by 4% next year, ending a red-hot market over the past two years that was fuelled by record low interest rates. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has also increased the risk of an inflation breakout, through higher prices for oil, wheat and barley. There’s also the risk that wages, which have not risen in real terms for a decade in Australia, will fail to keep up with inflation, despite Pallas predicting unemployment will stay low at about 4%. The Victorian treasurer is forecasting wages growth of 2.75% a year, growing to 3% a year over the following three years. But the budget papers concede that outside professional services and construction, there has so far been “little evidence that wages were rising beyond the relatively subdued rates of growth seen in the years leading up to the pandemic” and note that employers and workers have been “conditioned by a decade of low wage growth and business’ sharp focus on controlling costs”. Victoria’s budget is also at risk if a new Covid-19 variant emerges, slapping the brakes on the world – and state – economy. This would cut about 0.5% a year from Victoria’s gross state product, according to research commissioned by the government. But while the premier, Daniel Andrews, might have liked to call Covid a “wicked enemy”, Pallas focuses his ire on Frydenberg, who the state government has taken to saying is from Victoria but not for Victoria. An entire, and entirely new, chapter of Budget Paper 2 is dedicated to how Victoria has powered ahead “despite insufficient Commonwealth support”. Pallas makes the – true – assertions that Canberra has consistently given Victoria less than its fair share of infrastructure funding, and that a sweetheart deal with Western Australia puts the state’s GST revenue at risk. He described the deal as “the worst public policy disaster this nation’s had since we decided to build Canberra”; this was a clear riff on Frydenberg’s statement during the Melbourne lockdowns that they were the worst public policy disaster in Australian history. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He says Victoria had been disadvantaged under the GST carve-up, to the tune of $3bn and NSW $4bn, saying: “I’m on a unity ticket with treasurer Kean in NSW.” Despite the lack of money from Canberra, Pallas is pushing ahead with Victoria’s “big build” of infrastructure including roads, rail and removing even more level crossings. It is a pipeline Pallas proudly says has so far generated 140,000 jobs – but carries with it significant risk of its own. “Public investment has contributed profoundly to the economic growth of the state,” he says. But he admits that, at somewhere between $18bn and $20bn in government orders a year, the construction sector is “starting to tap out” of capacity to build things. This congested pipeline has already caused significant cost and time blowouts on the big build, especially the beleaguered West Gate Tunnel Project, where the government has had to tip in an extra $1.9bn. On average, big infrastructure projects are 4% over budget – 1% if the West Gate Tunnel project is excluded – and are taking 20% longer to complete than previously expected. As a result the government is establishing new oversight of projects bigger than $100bn and reconsidering the use of public-private partnership contracts, which are supposed to share risk between the state and the private sector but don’t always work. Pallas says PPPs will continue to be used where appropriate and the government wants to make sure the taxpayer does not become a “banker of last resort” for contractors. In the meantime, the focus is on controlling blowouts – something he claims the government is already improving. “The further on we go, the better we get at this,” he says.",News/Australia news,"In an election budget, Victorian treasurer Tim Pallas is fighting a war on many fronts",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/03/in-an-election-budget-victorian-treasurer-tim-pallas-is-fighting-a-war-on-many-fronts
5/3/2022,"Today is the first official day of lambing and I have three weeks off from my day job to fully concentrate on it. The alarm goes off and I roll out of bed and into some work clothes, rattling the ash out of the range cooker as I go past so that the kitchen will be warm when I return, past the sleeping dogs and out into the sunrise. The first check of the day is done quietly, just me on foot with my shepherd’s crook. The sheep have been put into four big fields for lambing; two have sheep expecting twins and two have sheep expecting singles. It is quite cold and there are three sets of fresh steaming twins in the first field that I go into. The yows have everything under control, so I do not intervene. I stand and watch from a distance as they clean their newborns and welcome them to the world. My job is to help if there is difficulty – if a yow is struggling to give birth, or if a lamb is unable to feed. I will go back later in the morning to check that all the lambs are full of warm milk. I will be able to see by the shape of their tummies if they have fed well. Meanwhile, I press on to see if there are any new single lambs in the furthest field. It is about half a mile away, a flat meadow on the banks of the River Lune. The river curls around the meadow and there is a gentle mist rising from it into the valley. Two pairs of oystercatchers are sitting in the field between the sheep. One new lamb is bouncing around already. He runs over to see me, and his mother calls him back. She is a young sheep and this is her first lamb. She wants to keep a close eye on him, so I walk past and leave them to it. At the far end of the meadow I see a sheep stood over what looks like a dead lamb. It is not moving. The yow is an older one who trusts me and does not mind as I lean over and pick up the lamb. I’m about to check his airway – but no need, he splutters into life. I put the lamb back on the ground and step away. He shakes his head and ears, and I know they will be fine from this point. As I stand and watch, a conversation strikes up. The yow bleats a low muttering sound, then pauses while the lamb replies.

5/3/2022,"The husband of fraudster Melissa Caddick has agreed to vacate a $15m property in Sydney’s eastern suburbs that she bought with funds stolen from investors so that it may be sold. Caddick falsely claimed to be a financial adviser to swindle $23m from investors before she vanished in November 2020. Caddick’s Ponzi scheme was under investigation by the financial services watchdog Asic at the time of her disappearance. Her partial remains washed up on a beach on the New South Wales south coast three months later. The federal court heard on Tuesday that Caddick’s husband, Anthony Koletti, would vacate the Dover Heights property the couple lived in with Caddick’s son by 18 May. Receivers appointed by the court are hoping to sell the property and other assets of Caddick to recoup the losses of those who invested with her company, Maliver. Caddick falsified the account records of her investors to make it appear as if their share portfolios had drastically increased in value, leading to some of them investing more money or referring other clients to her. But no investments had ever been made. Koletti will be able to dispute the removal of any personal property from the house under the orders made by Justice Brigitte Markovic on Tuesday. According to a document filed as part of the case by Koletti’s lawyers, he is seeking a court order that would grant him certain property, including five John Olsen paintings, a Gucci wedding dress, and cash and jewellery worth almost $100,000. He also claims an interest in the Dover Heights property, which his concise statement says has been assessed as worth from $15m to $17m by real estate agents, an Edgecliff property worth $4m, $7m in shares and $2.3m in other property including cars.

Caddick had told their parents that $1m of their money would be used to pay off the mortgage, but they discovered after her disappearance that she had not done so.

5/3/2022,"Furious Qantas passengers say they were left without their bags for up to six days after the airline flew them from Darwin to London without checked baggage, due to weight restrictions caused by a crumbling patch of runway at Darwin airport. The Guardian understands Qantas only became aware of the urgent runway repairs and weight restrictions at Darwin shortly before the scheduled flights early last week. The airline was forced to offload baggage so that its heavier long-haul aircraft did not require the entire runway, allowing it to avoid the patch of pavement that was deteriorating due to heavy rain. Passengers flying into London on Monday 25 April on QF9 said they were informed about 20 minutes before landing at Heathrow that all economy checked bags had been left behind in Darwin. Marnie Greenrod was one of more than 60 passengers on the flight who waited more than five days to be reunited with their luggage. She said that the inflight announcement told affected passengers a Qantas representative would provide information about what to do when they landed at 5am UK time. They were instead met by Heathrow ground staff who provided them with forms to track their luggage, and said they would receive an email with an individual code. “We were told they would not be processed until it was certain our bags had not made it, so we stood and watched the carousel for at least 45 minutes,” Greenrod said. Greenrod, who lives in London, said passengers were assured their bags would follow in 24-48 hours, but she did not receive hers until six days later, received no communication from Qantas and was unable to track the progress of her luggage. It’s understood that flights from Darwin to London were subject to weight restrictions for several days, meaning the bags from previous flights could not be loaded. Alison Taylor was also on the 25 April flight. She said she did have a reference code for her luggage, but was only able to track its movements via Twitter, thanks to a fellow passenger who had an AirTag on their bag. “Only once I did get through after waiting on hold for an hour and 40 minutes, and I got through to reservations in Fiji!” Taylor was given another reference number and told she could go and buy any supplies she needed, send in the receipts and be reimbursed. But having received no response from her three emails to Qantas customer care, Taylor did not proceed. “Mine eventually showed up last night, but wet and stinky, obviously left out in the rain somewhere. The whole thing has been extremely frustrating.” Passengers on subsequent Darwin to London flights claim Qantas sent them text messages advising them to pack immediate supplies including medication and clothing for a few days in their hand luggage as their check in baggage would not be travelling on their flight. Sam Thanos said he received this text message after he and fellow passengers had already checked their suitcases, so was of little use. Thanos has spent five hours on hold to Qantas call centres since he arrived in London on Saturday, trying to track down his bags that never arrived after he flew out of Melbourne, via Darwin. Passengers were told that their luggage was 24 hours behind them, but Thanos is into his third day of waiting. “It has completely killed the start of our holiday,” Thanos said. While Qantas cited weight restrictions, Thanos says the plane was no where near capacity. “Economy was half full,” he said. “Most rows passengers had to themselves, which was great for them to lay down during the flight.” When Thanos and his wife arrived in London, passengers were given an information leaflet and a unique identifier to register online. The contact number provided on the sheet went to voicemail, telling callers that due to changed circumstances they would not be taking calls. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “We are staying with my wife’s parents, which at least has been easy for us in not moving about. “I overheard other people talking to the person handing out the papers, saying they are moving every other day during their holidays, so for them it is probably even more of a nightmare.” A Qantas spokesperson said “an issue with the runway pavement at Darwin Airport resulted in temporary additional weight restrictions on our flights to London last week and unfortunately that meant we weren’t able to carry some passengers’ bags on their flight”. “Bags were reaccommodated on later flights and are couriered directly to customers as soon as we’re able to confirm the correct address. We apologise for the inconvenience this has caused our passengers and thank them for their understanding,” the spokesperson said. The spokesperson did not respond to claims support staff had been unresponsive, however it is understood the airline is recruiting more call centre operators after recent complaints. It’s understood the Darwin airport runway issue has now been fixed, allowing flights to take off with a full load of luggage on board. A Darwin airport spokesperson said “routine repairs to the runway are scheduled throughout the year, however weather conditions have brought forward the need to conduct this work sooner than expected”.",News/Business,Qantas leaves London-bound passengers’ bags in Darwin because aircraft was too heavy,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/03/qantas-passengers-furious-after-being-left-without-luggage-in-london-for-days
5/3/2022,"The Victorian government has handed down its election-year budget, with a centrepiece $12bn blitz on the state’s health system. Titled “putting patients first”, the budget outlines the Andrews government’s plan for repairing the state’s overburdened health sector and clearing deferred care that has built up over the pandemic. Here is a breakdown of key announcements in the budget, announced by the treasurer, Tim Pallas, on Tuesday. The government has responded to the state’s health crisis with an injection of $12bn in new funding, including hiring up to 7,000 new healthcare workers, bolstering the paramedic service and improving infrastructure. The government will inject $4.2bn into the state’s pandemic response, including $1.1bn on free rapid antigen tests for schools, Victorians with a disability and other vulnerable cohorts, and $522m to help hospitals treat Covid. There’s a further $248m for personal protective equipment and $258m to boost vaccination rates and expand the booster program. The government has previously announced a $1.5bn investment to help clear the state’s backlog of deferred elective surgery procedures. The latest figures, released on Saturday, revealed more than 89,000 Victorians were on the waitlist. Victoria will also recruit 2,000 foreign healthcare workers to help fill critical workforce shortages, with a $564.8m investment in the next financial year. And to address ambulance ramping and lengthy wait times, the government will spend $333m on almost 400 new staff for the triple zero call service and a further $124m on an additional 90 paramedics. The “better at home” program, which helps more Victorians receive healthcare in their homes, will be extended with a $698m funding boost. To continue delivering the recommendations of the royal commission into Victoria’s mental health system, the state government is setting aside $1.3bn for reforms. And it will spend $218m to establish 82 new facility beds across the state and $196m to replace and expand the mental health facility at Goulburn Valley Health in Shepparton. The Andrews government will build 13 new schools across the state as part of a $1.8bn spend on school infrastructure. The commitment includes $560m to upgrade a further 65 schools, including 35 for students with special needs. The state will also invest $779m to recruit about 900 new teachers, to give the sector more time to prepare and focus on lesson planning. A previously announced, a $277.5m package will streamline the state’s two secondary school certificates – the Victoria Certificate of Education and the Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning – from next year to help improve access to careers in trades. Early childhood is not a big ticket item but the budget includes $131m to continue four-year-old kindergarten and $15m for delivering kinder kits to kids starting three-year-old kindergarten in 2023 and 2024. The state’s police union had urged the government to invest in recruiting an additional 1,500 additional police officers for the beat within four years, warning that lengthy ambulance response times could be mirrored in the service. The budget’s investment of $342m to recruit 502 extra police officers and 50 protective services officers over two years falls short of the union’s plea. Victoria is set to host the 2026 Commonwealth Games, across four regional hubs in Ballarat, Bendigo, Geelong and Gippsland. The government has outlined a $2.6bn spend for the games, but provided no breakdown on those investments in the budget papers. The government is undertaking further scoping of potential competition sites. While the opening ceremony will be held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the Games will be a decentralised event showcasing regional Victoria. The government estimates it will generate $3bn for the state’s economy. As unveiled on Monday, every Victorian household will be eligible to receive a one-off $250 payment to help ease financial pressure from energy bills. To be eligible for the rebate from 1 July, households must compare their energy deals on the government’s independent price comparison website to search for the cheapest energy deal. The government estimates seven out of ten households will save an average of $330 a year in bills by using the comparison site. The bonus will cost the state $250m. The budget sets aside $383m for new transport infrastructure under Victoria’s “big build”, with funding for level crossing removals, train timetable service upgrades and train station upgrades. A $780 million package will deliver road maintenance works across metropolitan and regional Victoria – an issue that has been one of the Coalition’s attack lines against the government. The Andrews government previously announced $158m to make train stations and tram stops more accessible. Victoria’s regional rail network – V Line – will receive a $248m investment to improve reliability and efficiency. A further $24m will provide maintenance works for the West Gate Bridge. The government will invest $1bn in low-interest loans and government guarantees for the community housing sector, which the government estimates will deliver 6,000 new social and affordable houses. The budget pledges $215m to environment initiatives, including $57m to improve efficiency of the state’s water supply and $10m for Great Ocean Road reform to protect the region from erosion.",News/Australia news,"Victoria state budget 2022 at a glance: health, education and police in focus",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/03/victoria-state-budget-at-a-glance
