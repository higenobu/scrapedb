Elon Musk's sway over the price of dogecoin continues following a Tuesday tweet from the world's richest person. Musk tweeted Tuesday morning that McDonald's should accept the meme-crypto token as a form of payment, and if they did he would eat a happy meal on TV. ""I will eat a happy meal on tv if @McDonalds accepts Dogecoin,"" Musk tweeted. Right after the tweet, the price of dogecoin surged as much as 8% to $0.1445, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The 10th most valuable cryptocurrency, worth about $18.5 billion, has since pared some of its gains. Musk's Tesla accepts dogecoin as a form of payment for some of its merchandise, and temporarily accepted bitcoin as a form of payment for its vehicles last year. Musk's tweet comes a day after McDonald's started to interact with the crypto community via Twitter. The fast-food giant tweeted ""how are you doing people who run crypto twitter accounts"" amid a sharp sell-off in the crypto market on Monday. Flipping burgers at McDonald's is an often-said joke among the crypto community during periods of downside volatility. Over the weekend, El Salvador president Nayib Bukele tweeted a photoshopped picture of him wearing a McDonald's uniform as bitcoin plummeted below $40,000. In response to a meme tweeted by Binance on Monday, McDonald's responded, ""wagmi friend,"" short for we are gonna make it.

1/26/2022,"A man from North Carolina, Jake Ross, was sentenced to 55 years in prison for paying a mother in the Philippines to sexually abuse her children over livestream.

The 47-year-old man from McDowell County received the longest sentence ever given in a child pornography case by the federal courts in the Asheville division of the Western District of North Carolina, reported the Charlotte Observer.

The Chief U.S. District Judge Martin Reidinger also added a lifetime of court supervision if Ross were to outlive his sentence. U.S. lawyer Dena King stated Ross’ punishment “reflects the depravity of his actions.”

Ross was arrested in July 2020 for his involvement as a dealer in “webcam sex tourism,” wherein “pornography from mostly from developing countries is live-streamed on social media platforms around the globe,” according to prosecutors.

According to the court documents reported on by the Observer, federal investigators found 28 pornographic screenshots from Ross’ WhatsApp video chats with the Filipino mother on his phone. Screen grabs of other livestreamed sex abuse of children were also uncovered from Ross’ Google accounts.

“These types of crimes that prey on our children sicken me,” King said.

 According to the global anti-child exploitation network ECPAT International, an estimated 60,000 to 100,000 Filipino children, typically impoverished girls aged 14 to 17, are trafficked each year in the Philippines. The country was described as “the global epicentre of the live-stream sexual abuse trade” by UNICEF in 2016.

The Department of Justice Office of Cybercrime also reported a 264.63% increase in online sexual exploitation of children after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in the Philippines in 2020, according to The Philippine Star.

1/26/2022,"Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) has come under fire from Hill Democrats for his leadership style, Politico reported Tuesday. His failure to reach a compromise with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) to pass the Build Back Better bill and his decision to force a vote on President Biden's already doomed voting rights agenda, several Democratic staffers told Politico, highlighted divisions in the party at a time when Democrats are in danger of losing their already razor-thin majority. ""Leadership 101 is even if you don't get someone today, you're going to need them tomorrow,"" one senior House Democratic aide told Politico. ""The level of malpractice is stunning. BBB is a once-in-a-10-year opportunity, and we f--ked it up."" Schumer turned Sens. Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) into scapegoats, staffers argued, subjecting his fellow Democrats the ire that ought to have been directed toward Republicans. On Jan. 18, Schumer refused to rule out supporting primary challengers to Manchin and Sinema, Business Insider reported. Manchin represents a deeply conservative state and is far likelier to be replaced by a hard-right Republican than by a progressive Democrat. Sinema, who was censured by Arizona Democratic Party leadership over the weekend, became the first Democratic Senator from Arizona since 1995 by running as a moderate. Politico points out that Schumer's willingness to consider turning on members of his own caucus stands in sharp contrast to the leadership styles of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). According to Politico, Pelosi has ""argued numerous times that the party should lay off Manchin and Sinema, defending the pair in a press conference last week just after Schumer refused to disavow primary challenges to the two."" Likewise, McConnell ""has not only tried to avoid allowing votes that would divide his conference, but also defended Republican moderates"" like Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Mitt Romney (R-Utah) ""from attacks from the right.""

1/26/2022,"It was another especially awful day inside the COVID-19 unit at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston. Another patient was dying from the coronavirus, and now another health care worker had to make the dreaded call. Alan Hawes, a registered nurse who made the leap into nursing in 2011 after more than two decades working as a newspaper photojournalist, clutched his camera as the inevitable came into focus. He watched from across the room last fall as his colleague in the medical intensive care unit, Andrea Crain, picked up the phone and told a patient’s wife that she needed to get to the hospital. Her husband was dying from COVID-19, and there was nothing more they could do. She needed to come quickly. She needed to come say goodbye. This is the devastating reality of the coronavirus pandemic in South Carolina. Hawes said he just wanted the public to be able to see it. On Tuesday morning, both Hawes and his photographs from inside MUSC’s COVID unit made their national TV debut in a story that aired on “CBS Mornings.” “This whole pandemic affects all of the medical workers that work in these conditions and it’s not just, you know, about the PPE (personal protective equipment) and the high patient load, but it’s the emotional load that we carry as well,” said 52-year-old Hawes. “I want the world to see.” After Crain hung up the phone that day, she burst into tears. Hawes had watched the entire scene unfold and captured the moment when his colleague broke down at the nurse’s station. She wept for Joel Croxton, a 72-year-old patient who was fully vaccinated and boosted but still succumbed to the virus on Sept. 14. Crain had been calling his wife, Sandy. “That day, she told me she was so tired of seeing all this death,” Hawes said. The photograph of the weeping nurse is just one of the images Hawes has taken since he began documenting the human toll of the coronavirus. But it is his vantage point from inside the hospital that gives the public a rare glimpse into how the coronavirus pandemic is impacting patients, the people who love them and the people who are trying to save their lives. “Nurses are broken right now, emotionally,” Hawes told CBS News correspondent David Begnaud. “Are you?” he asked. “I feel like I am, yes,” Hawes responded. Before the segment aired, Hawes told The State newspaper he had hoped that these photos and this story on a national news network would save some lives. “And I hope that they don’t cause pain,” Hawes said, as he thought about the family members who might see images of their loved ones broadcast across the country. “But if I can get the word out and hopefully save some lives with these pictures, then that will cause a lot less pain.” He thinks back to 72-year-old Croxton, the patient who Hawes said did everything right. He got vaccinated. He got his booster shot. And Croxton was also one of the first patients to sign a waiver and participate in this photo project. “He just had a weakened immune system. So someone had to have given it to him. You don’t just get COVID from living, so at some point it was transmitted to him,” Hawes said. In one of the photos Hawes took, Croxton is sitting in a hospital bed with a BiPap mask across his face to help him breathe. But Hawes can’t forget his eyes. “He’s just looking into the camera. He just looks scared to me, and it’s almost like he knows there’s nothing he can do,” Hawes said. “He’s just looking into the camera like, ‘Help me.’ But there was nothing we could do. We knew he wasn’t going to make it.” A few days later, Croxton died. His wife made it in time to say goodbye, to hold his hand, to pray with him with a hospital chaplain over an iPad being held by his nurse. “That was a really hard picture for me to look at,” Hawes said, his voice catching in his throat. Hawes said it took a year and a half to convince the hospital to greenlight the photography project. He told CBS News that they finally said “yes” when he sent his request with the subject line “Public Service Project.” “His images showcase the harsh reality of COVID-19, and it is a privilege for Hawes to represent MUSC to a national audience,” said Carter Coyle, a hospital spokesperson. But the images have also been a morale boost, too. Unlike his photojournalism days, Hawes said family members, patients and his fellow health care workers are grateful when they see him snapping pictures in the intensive care unit. “Thank God someone’s here to show what’s going on,” people have told Hawes on multiple occasions. The photo project, like the pandemic itself, is far from over. With the omicron variant sending more patients back to hospital intensive care units and emergency rooms, Hawes said he has picked up his camera again. As of Monday, the number of COVID-19 inpatient hospitalizations at MUSC’s downtown Charleston campus was 161. On Dec. 21, there were just 13 inpatient hospitalizations for COVID. But Hawes said he will be there, documenting whatever comes next.",U.S./The State,‘I want the world to see.’ How a SC nurse showed the nation the COVID crisis up close,https://news.yahoo.com/want-world-see-sc-nurse-150455189.html
1/26/2022,"A Pensacola man is still reeling several days after he lost the love of his life in a fire that destroyed the couple's humble campsite where they had been living. Craig Heathcoe, 55, said he tried to save his girlfriend, Angela Meeks, from the flames after a small portable heater accidentally caught their camping tent on fire last week. Meeks, 53, who had trouble walking unassisted due to recent strokes, succumbed to her burn wounds Wednesday night before paramedics arrived to the homeless camp where she and Heathcoe had been living together as a couple for almost a year. The fire: Woman dies in fire at Escambia encampment, highlights dangers for homeless population Related: Pensacola sets Jan. 31 deadline for people to leave I-110 homeless encampment Heathcoe himself was badly burned while trying to pull Meeks out of their tent’s boiling nylon, and less than a week removed from the tragedy, he’s still living in the woods and in pain. The skin up and down the right side of his body is raw and stings when an over-the-counter burn cream is applied. But the physical pain, Heathcoe said, pales in intensity compared to the hurt in his heart. “I prayed for her for 54 years until I found her, but then I only got to spend one year with her,” he said about his lost love, Angie. Heathcoe is heartbroken, and the ache of it is consuming. “She loved me every day. She loved me. And she truly loved me, not like all those other damn women who I’ve had in my past,” he said. “Angie loved me, and I loved her.” He said that she loved him regardless of his past and current situation. To her, it hadn’t mattered that he was homeless, lived in the woods in a tent and had spent the better part of the past decade rambling his way across the continental U.S. jobless. On cold and desperate nights in the woods when they were huddled together, Meeks made Heathcoe feel like he was still a special person with a place in the world — by her side. “Yes, I loved her with all my heart, bro — all my heart,” Heathcoe said. Heathcoe and Meeks’ tent was set up next to a tent shared by two brothers on the night of the fire in the area of the 4200 block of North Palafox and Hickory streets. Annual survey: Volunteers station at homeless camps, soup kitchens for annual point-in-time survey Heathcoe was seated outside talking to his two neighbors at about 7 p.m. Meeks was asleep on the couple's bed inside of the tent, lying next a small portal heater positioned inside the tent to keep her warm. “It happened so quick. I couldn’t really tell you what happened. It happened so quick. I’ve never really seen nothing go up that quick in my life,” Heathcoe said. He didn’t see what exactly happened inside the tent. All he knows is that one second everything was fine and the next his home was ablaze. Meeks couldn’t get out on her own because of her disability, and Heathcoe rushed to try to pull her out, in the process suffering burns. ""All over the right side of my body, my face, my arm, all over the right side of my body I’m burned pretty good,” he said. “I’m guessing third-degree because, my knuckle, it burned the hide off my knuckle.” One of the two brothers living in the text next door to Heathcoe and Meeks called 911, and Escambia County Fire Rescue was dispatched to the scene. “It went up so fast, man,” Heathcoe remembered. Heathcoe said he and Meeks met at the beginning of 2021 at a Loaves and Fishes organization in Biloxi, Mississippi, and instantly fell in love. They liked everything about each other, and in the early days of their relationship, the pair spent hours just talking and chatting, chatting about anything and everything. “She was just a good woman. She never smoked a cigarette, never drank a drop of alcohol in her life, never done no drugs, never done none of all that,” he said. “She was just a damn good woman.” Meeks had already suffered multiple recent strokes before Heathcoe met her, he said. She was paralyzed on the right side of her body, used a wheelchair and Heathcoe became her caretaker. They moved to Pensacola together looking for a better life last February. “We spent all our holidays together for the last freaking year, and every holiday was special to her — Valentine's, Christmas, Thanksgiving. She loved holidays,” he said. After the fire, Heathcoe was transported to the hospital but discharged after a single night. He moved into the neighboring tent occupied by the two brothers who had lived next to him and Meeks. Heathcoe said that Walter Arrington, the homeless health care navigator for Community Health Northwest Florida, has been checking in on him regularly since the fire. While Arrington could not comment on what help if any he was providing Heathcoe as he is not permitted to speak about patients or potential patients, he said ""the mission of Community Health, us being a federally qualified health care facility, is making sure that we are bringing health care to underserved populations."" Michael Kimberl, director of the Alfred-Washburn Center, said that his organization has been supplying Heathcoe with necessary supplies since the accident. Anyone who would like to make a donation to help Heathcoe and the area’s other homeless people may do so by contacting the Alfred-Washburn Center.

1/26/2022,"Sen. Joe Manchin is reportedly furious with the White House chief of staff Ron Klain. The Washington Post reported that Manchin feels it's up to Klain to repair the rift. Manchin's relationship with the White House continues to be closely watched. Sen. Joe Manchin reportedly remains displeased with the White House's handling of his opposition to President Joe Biden's social-spending and climate plan, The Washington Post reported. Manchin blames Ron Klain, the White House chief of staff, for the struggles between Washington's two Joes. ""Manchin has told allies that he believes Klain has pushed Biden to embrace a more liberal policy agenda, adding that Klain must repair the relationship with him if the chief of staff is to be involved in future negotiations,"" The Post wrote in an in-depth review of Klain's first year in the White House. Manchin previously vented that he was at his ""wit's end"" with Biden's staff, a frustration he mentioned when he told Fox News in December that he could not support Biden's sweeping Build Back Better Plan. Steve Clemons, a close Manchin confidant, later wrote that the senator was particularly upset over a White House statement that singled him out after an earlier setback in negotiations over Biden's plan. With Democrats clutching to razor-thin majorities, Manchin's relationship with the White House is of the utmost importance to Biden's agenda. ""Given the protests that Manchin's family has experienced at his home, which is a boat in Washington Harbor — with folks harassing him, his wife and grandson by kayak around his boat and the gate to the marina — I knew this presidential statement was personalizing the game. It put his family at risk, in my view,"" Clemons wrote in The Hill. Klain is a longtime Biden hand, who first worked for the president in the late 1980s when Biden was a senator. Klain, per The Post, had a role in drafting the White House's blistering statement after Manchin announced his definitive opposition to Build Back Better. A spokesperson for Manchin did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Other unnamed sources told The Post that Klain has rubbed other top Democrats the wrong way. Some Republicans have taken to suggesting Klain is the real president or has power akin to a prime minister. In recent years, White House chiefs of staff typically have not lasted long. President Trump went through four either acting or permanent chiefs in his single term. President Obama churned through five in eight years. ""It is a grinding job, there's no question about it,"" Klain told The Post. ""It takes a lot of stamina to do it. So we'll see how long it lasts.""
