3/27/2022,"Openly acknowledged or not, regime change in Moscow – meaning the overthrow of Vladimir Putin – must be the western democracies’ ultimate objective as they help to thwart his conquest of Ukraine. Pursuing imperial fantasies, a tsar-like Putin has gone too far this time. Now he’s got to go. Urgently required: a new Russian revolution to topple the tyrant, led from within and assisted from without. The idea of Putin remaining in power, even if a Ukraine settlement is eventually patched together, is both impractical and obscene. By his inhuman actions, Russia’s dictator has placed himself beyond the pale. He’s a menace to universal order, an affront to common decency. He simply cannot be trusted. Despite resounding international condemnation, the damaging impact of western sanctions on Russia’s people, the resulting threat to global food and energy supplies, and daily evidence that his ill-led armed forces are in deep trouble, Putin appears determined to fight on, even to escalate. Last week’s disappointing Nato summit will have done little to dissuade him. US president Joe Biden warns this blind fanaticism could bring on a death struggle, leading to Russian use of chemical, biological or even battlefield nuclear weapons. The Kremlin does not rule it out. Such crude blackmail is no basis for any kind of sane relationship. Washington has now formally accused Russia of war crimes, for which Putin bears command responsibility, and vowed to bring him to justice. The UN’s highest court has ordered him to stop. Biden deems him a “war criminal” and a “pure thug”. Who, in their hearts, honestly disagrees? Even his Chinese chums look askance. For as long as he holds power, Putin will pose a potentially existential threat to the security of Europe and the wider world. His contempt for human life, rights, international law and the UN charter disqualify him from any future leadership role. For who can doubt the Ukraine war would halt if he were unseated? There will be no peace while Putin’s around. He’s unfit. He’s an outlaw. He’s a second Bashar al-Assad. He must fall. Logically, practically and morally speaking, the US and its allies have no alternative but to actively seek his overthrow. They cannot directly intervene in Russia. But they can and should make it plain to Russia’s elites and wider public that Putin is a liability, a deadweight and a danger, primarily to them – and that the west will back them if they move against him. People often say revolution will never happen. But they said that about Nicolae Ceaușescu, Erich Honecker, Hosni Mubarak, Ferdinand Marcos, Anastasio Somoza,the Shah of Iran – and Tsar Nicholas II. So maybe they’re wrong about Putin too. There’s good reason to believe all those billionaire oligarchs, state industry bosses, sycophantic Duma politicians, braided generals and Oblomov-like bureaucrats who have done well under Putin are having second thoughts now as sanctions bite, assets freeze, foreign travel halts, houses and yachts are seized, and the rouble crashes. Its governing class has much to lose as Russia hurtles into recession and isolation – and it’s showing. Bypassed Kremlin insiders and FSB spooks are reportedly seething with anger. Putin’s bumbling defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, and army chief of staff have disappeared from view. A senior envoy, Anatoly Chubais, jumped ship last week. Meanwhile, Ukraine reports 1917-style desertions by Russia’s demoralised frontline troops. As for the long-suffering, much-bamboozled Russian people, no amount of regime propaganda can hide their new daily reality of food queues, rising prices, medical shortages and closed banks. Thousands have demonstrated against the invasion, braving police brutality. Thousands more young professionals – Russia’s future – are moving abroad as paranoid Putin rails against a traitorous “fifth column”. The longer the war, the higher the casualties and costs, the more public anger may be directed at Putin. The west should increase the pressure and facilitate his demolition through tighter, deeper sanctions (including, crucially, on energy exports), offensive military aid to Kyiv and expanded broadcast and social media information campaigns inside Russia. Any future leader seems most likely to come from within the Kremlin apparatus. A transitional figure could emerge in much the same way as did Putin himself in the dying days of Boris Yeltsin’s presidency. At the other end of the opposition spectrum, the always defiant Alexei Navalny is a potent rallying force. The toppling of Putin may prove a long-term aspiration or could happen very quickly. Historically, change in Russia often occurs abruptly. The hope would be for a subsequent move to free, democratic elections. Yet what happens ultimately depends on Russians themselves. To maximise the chances of success, the western powers should consider all overt and covert methods of encouraging new leadership, including political incentives, security guarantees and perhaps even a “money back” scheme for repentant oligarchs. If appeals to principle do not work, appeals to self-interest may. EU and Nato members must agree, too, that Putin is not someone they can ever do business with again. Let’s hope France and Germany get the message. Liz Truss, Britain’s foreign secretary, is concerned they may let Putin off the hook by offering a revised, Minsk-type compromise over the Ukrainians’ heads, similar to their failed Crimea initiative. Meanwhile, backsliding, fence-sitting, ostensibly pro-western governments in Israel, India, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the UAE that refuse to sanction Russia, must be firmly reminded who their real friends are – and how their interests are best served. It’s not by sucking up to a war criminal. It’s not by rationalising or minimising an unprovoked war of aggression against a sovereign democracy. It’s by doing all they can to help Russians and their friends in the west bring Putin’s murderous reign to an end. As Bolshevik revolutionaries once cried, so must Russia’s people cry again: “Peace! Land! Bread!”",Opinion/Opinion,Wanted: Russian revolution to topple tyrant.

3/27/2022,"Donald Trump’s continuing effort to bend national Republican candidates to his will and the party to do his bidding faces a test in the key state of Georgia on Saturday as the former president holds a score-settling rally there in support of candidates who could boost any future re-election agenda. Trump’s presence in the state comes 18 months after he pressured Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, to “find” enough votes to overturn Joe Biden’s victory, a conversation that is now the subject of a grand jury investigation in Atlanta. The loss, which made Trump the first Republican presidential candidate to lose the state in 28 years, continues to rankle the former president, and he has endorsed the state congressman Jody Hice in his challenge to Raffensperger. He also backed other candidates in the state against establishment Republicans, including David Perdue against the sitting governor, Brian Kemp. It follows a similar pattern in other states where Trump has held or plans to hold rallies as a way of showing support for Republican candidates who have offered him their fealty. Saturday’s rally in Commerce, 70 miles north-east of Atlanta and one of the most conservative parts of the state, is expected to feature Herschel Walker, a former football player running for the US Senate; Perdue; and the congressional candidate Vernon Jones, a former Democratic state representative who began calling himself the “Black Donald Trump” after switching parties. But Trump is playing a high-stakes game and his candidates’ success in Georgia’s May primaries is far from guaranteed. Walker is slightly ahead of the Democratic senator Raphael Warnock in RealClearPolitics polling averages, but Jones, who dropped a bid for the governorship in February, faces a crowded Republican field for the conservative 10th congressional district, which covers part of east Georgia. Trump’s pick for governor, Perdue, faces an even more complex struggle. He has struggled to raise campaign money and trails incumbent Brian Kemp by 11 points, according to a Fox News poll. Perdue has toed Trump’s false line of a “stolen” 2020 election and begun claiming that his defeat to the Democratic senator Jon Ossoff, to whom he conceded in January, was also problematic. “Most people in Georgia know that something untoward happened in November 2020,” he told the talk radio host Bryan Pritchard. “I’ll just say it, Bryan. In my election and the president’s election, they were stolen. The evidence is compelling now.” The Perdue-Kemp contest represents a personal grudge for Trump, which flared after Kemp after refused to support his bid overturn Georgia’s 2020 election result. Trump has also sought to undermine the governor by backing Patrick Witt, who supported Trump’s election challenge, against John King, who is Georgia’s first Latino statewide constitutional officer and a Kemp loyalist. Witt is running against King in the Republican primary for state insurance commissioner. But the larger question is how far Trump’s influence extends in shaping Georgia’s Republican politics. To some, the former president’s endorsement power is diminishing in the state. “He will not be a help to Trump-endorsed candidates when he comes on Saturday,” the conservative commentator Martha Zoller told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution this week. “He will be negative and backward looking – and that’s not what voters want.” Some Republican pollsters said that while Trump’s endorsement was coveted, he had diluted his influence by reaching far down the ballot or supporting late-entry candidates with little public recognition or campaign apparatus.",News/US news,Trump heads to Georgia in high-stakes bid to shape Republican primaries,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/26/donald-trump-georgia-republican-primary-rally
3/27/2022,"Shortly after its release in 2019, Dance Monkey, by the Australian artist Tones and I, became the biggest song in the world. If you passed a radio playing music, you probably heard it. Its lilting, simple piano-and-beat loop had a rapid, whiplash-inducing rise to the top. The statistics around it are so large that they blur into an immeasurable mass: YouTube views and Spotify plays are well into the billions and it is the most Shazammed song of all time. (You’d think, given its ubiquity, people wouldn’t need to Shazam it any more, but it remains in the top spot.) Tones and I had been a busker not long before Dance Monkey came out and, for her, its success was life-changing and then some. But, as is often the way with songs that become far bigger than their performer, the artist has a complicated relationship with it. “I loathe that song a lot of the time,” she told the Australian station Nova FM. “A lot of the time, I don’t want to sing it. I’m not going to write another song like it.” She was talking about working with songwriters who were aiming to recreate the magic of Dance Monkey. “I was like, I don’t wanna go there any more,” she said. Elsewhere in Australia, a presenter on morning TV asked Bryan Adams to explain the albatross around his neck, Summer of ’69. I watched the clip because, having done a fair few of them myself, I am helplessly drawn to awkward interviews: I can’t resist the painful wince of witnessing a ropey question followed by a rude answer. “I don’t want to talk about that. I want to talk about the new album, that’s why I’m here,” he said, curtly. That new album is called So Happy It Hurts. Perhaps the title is ironic. Both Tones and I and Adams are part of a long tradition. Madonna reportedly despises Like a Virgin. Radiohead didn’t play Creep for years. Michael Stipe is scathing about REM’s Shiny Happy People. Liam Gallagher says he hates Wonderwall, but then again, Gallagher strikes me as a man whose words should be taken with a fistful of salt. Kanye West wrote Gold Digger because he knew it would make money, but says he never really liked it. This complicated relationship with the hand that feeds is so common that it’s practically a pop star rite of passage. For all of the chart successes and the number ones and most-played accolades, rejecting your biggest hit is a sign you’ve really made it. Elise Loehnen, who until 2020 was Gwyneth Paltrow’s second-in-command at Goop, has revealed that when she left the “wellness” company she decided to “forswear any cleansing”, claiming that she has eaten like a teenager in the two years since. This announcement, made on Instagram, is not a rejection of personal hygiene, but an important point about the toxicity of cleanses and detoxes. “To me, it had become synonymous with dieting and restriction,” she said. “And I felt like I was not in a healthy relationship with my body, where I was always trying to punish it, bring it under control.” I remember once sitting down with someone who was on the third day of a “cleanse” – and I apologise for the quotation marks here, but this is the wellness industry, and it deserves it – who had been surviving on cayenne pepper, maple syrup and lemon juice and barely had the energy to talk. The science debunking even the idea of a detox is plentiful and widespread and I am glad to hear a prominent figure in that world explaining the problems she had with it. Even if it is a bit like Jeremy Clarkson swearing off cars. In Los Angeles, as the film world geared up for the Oscars by hoping that people would actually watch the ceremony, the director and Academy member Richard Curtis talked about the historic lack of recognition for comedic films and comic actors. Will Ferrell should have been nominated for Elf, he said. “I think it’s a real issue that comedy isn’t respected as much... but I do try and push for comedy performances whenever I can,” he added. I try to watch as many of the best picture nominees as possible each year, but this is rarely an uplifting experience. Of course it is stunningly beautiful, and brilliantly acted and directed, but it took me several run-ups before I managed to muster the enthusiasm to watch The Power of the Dog. There is a lightness to Licorice Pizza, but the only film nominated for best picture that could be considered a straightforward comedy is Don’t Look Up, a movie about the imminent end of the world. The funniest thing about it was how many heated family arguments it caused over Christmas. Insightful masterpiece or patronising, self-satisfied waffle? There were a lot of opinions. Curtis pointed out that comedy films tend to make more money and that is their reward. It’s true that there is far more critical snobbery around comedy, though there is a strong argument to be made that it’s harder to be truly funny. It is also harder to agree on what makes people laugh, because humour is simply much more divisive. The same humour/drama imbalance is just as true for novels and for television. What I’m saying, I think, is that Jackass Forever was robbed.

3/27/2022,"Sheffield Wednesday boosted their hopes of an immediate return to the Championship with an impressive 4-1 win over Cheltenham at Hillsborough. Darren Moore’s side knew victory would lift them above Sunderland and back into the top six, but the hosts made the worst possible start as Alfie May fired mid-table Cheltenham in front with four minutes on the clock. Massimo Luongo levelled from a corner just three minutes later, and the game stayed 1-1 until the break. Lee Gregory put the hosts in front for the first time in the 58th minute as he found the bottom corner from distance, and Wednesday pulled away late on. Jack Hunt volleyed home in the 83rd minute and George Byers completed the scoring four minutes later, beating his marker before firing home from close range. Plymouth missed the chance to move closer to the top two as their six-game winning run was ended by Ipswich. Sam Morsy’s close-range finish in the first half – the first goal Argyle had conceded in seven games – proved to be enough for the ninth-placed hosts, who kept their hopes of a late surge into the playoffs alive. At the other end of the table, Gillingham held on for a 2-1 victory at Accrington to move four points clear of the relegation zone. Charlie Kelman opened the scoring after Vadaine Oliver’s shot had been saved by Stanley goalkeeper Liam Isherwood, with Oliver then beating Isherwood to a high ball to double the lead. Colby Bishop scored a late consolation from the penalty spot. AFC Wimbledon stay in the bottom four after Adam May struck a superb winner for Cambridge early in the second half at Plough Lane. Doncaster are in even deeper trouble, four points from safety with six games to play, after Jayden Stockley secured a 1-0 win for Charlton at the Keepmoat Stadium. Shrewsbury continued their climb into mid-table security thanks to Daniel Udoh’s late winner at home to Lincoln. Exeter edged out lowly Stevenage at St James Park, winning 2-1 to go just four points behind leaders Forest Green, who were not in action. Sam Stubbs’ first-half double proved enough to earn victory, while Northampton stay in third after Sam Hoskins’ early goal set up a 2-0 home win over mid-table Hartlepool. James Wilson and Jamie Proctor were on target as Port Vale beat Sutton 2-0 to go fourth in the table. Newport drew 0-0 at Bradford while Bristol Rovers and Tranmere both lost by the odd goal. Kristian Dennis got the winner as Paul Simpson’s Carlisle revival continued against the Pirates, while Junior Tchamadeu’s fine stoppage-time finish earned struggling Colchester a priceless win. That late winner was bad news for Oldham, who slumped to another stoppage-time defeat at Boundary Park. Davis Keillor-Dunn had put the hosts in front but Mansfield rallied through Rhys Oates before George Lapslie’s last-minute winner. Barrow remain in the relegation mix as they lost 2-0 at Leyton Orient in Phil Brown’s first game in charge. Rock-bottom Scunthorpe look doomed to the drop, still 10 points from safety after losing 3-0 at home to Harrogate, with Will Smith’s double ending Town’s seven-game winless run. Elsewhere, Salford came from behind to beat Walsall 2-1 and Ashley Nadesan got the winner as Crawley beat Rochdale 1-0. Wrexham and Dover produced one of the games of the season on Non-League Day. The promotion-chasing hosts took a 2-0 lead, only to fall 5-2 behind against opponents who have already been relegated. Michael Gyasi struck a 12-minute hat-trick for the visitors early in the second half, but Ollie Palmer’s quick double gave Wrexham new hope at 5-4 down. Dover held on until the 91st minute when Jordan Davies levelled, and Dan Jarvis made it Wrexham 6-5 Dover with virtually the last kick of the game. “Bury me in Wales,” tweeted the co-chairman, Ryan Reynolds, after the final whistle.

3/27/2022,"Country Grammer provided Frankie Dettori with a fourth success in the Dubai World Cup at Meydan. The winning horse over the dirt was trained by Bob Baffert, who himself collected a fourth World Cup success despite controversy back home in the United States, where he is fighting a series of legal battles over Medina Spirit’s positive post-race test for banned substances when winning last year’s Kentucky Derby. Baffert has recently lost four Kentucky Derby hopefuls after owners moved them to new trainers to allow them to run in this year’s race on 7 May. The trainer of 2018 Triple Crown winner Justify is banned from his horses competing at Churchill Downs, where the Derby is held. He received that two-year ban last June but is still allowed to compete elsewhere and duly collected another World Cup to follow training the winners of the 1998, 2001 and 2017 winners on Silver Charm, Captain Steve and Arrogate respectively. Medina Spirit himself died of a heart attack while training in Santa Anita last December. Dettori won his first Dubai showpiece event aboard the great Dubai Millennium in 2000 and on Moon Ballad in 2003 and Electrocutionist in 2006. Having earlier finished in a dead heat with Japanese runner Panthalassa for the Dubai Turf, the Italian’s mount was part of a formidable American World Cup contingent headed by red-hot favourite Life Is Good. Todd Pletcher’s Breeders’ Cup Dirt Mile winner had successfully stepped up to nine furlongs in the Pegasus World Cup in January.

3/27/2022,"On the tarmac of Dubai airport, half way along its main runway, a small terminal has been doing brisk business this month. Daily flights have disgorged dozens of Russians – many among the wealthiest figures in Vladimir Putin’s inner circle. A short VIP welcome and limousine ride later, and the oligarchs are into a world that cares little about Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine or the attempts to punish Putin, and has instead willingly embraced his enablers. Perhaps more than anywhere else in the world, the oligarchs, and other cashed-up Russians are welcome in Dubai, along with their riches, which are flooding to the United Arab Emirates in unprecedented amounts – often via discreet means. The UAE has not followed western governments in using sanctions as retaliation for the invasion of Ukraine. Bankers, real estate agents, car dealerships and marinas are reporting extraordinary demand for homes, sports cars and mooring space as the influx settles in to an oil-rich monarchy that has charted its own course on Putin’s Russia and is not afraid to expose glaring tensions with the US in doing so. Transactions, from elite property sales to leases, are largely being conducted using cryptocurrencies, but some have been straight transfers from Russian financial entities linked to sanctioned tycoons, a regional intelligence source told the Observer. Such moves undermine sanctions imposed by the US and EU on the Russian leaders’ allies and are a potent lure for the next rung of Russian businessmen who fear the same fate. Real estate agents in Dubai are reporting one of the biggest bull markets ever as Russian investors snap up apartments sight unseen, either buying them outright, or paying a year’s rent in advance. “It’s been unbelievable,” said Alan Pinto, a leasing consultant at Espace Real Estate in Dubai Marina. “A radical amount of Russian investors are purchasing units. Even tenants; we’ve had a huge amount of calls. They transfer their funds via crypto. They have an intermediary who will do that for them and then the cash is passed to the landlords.” Rumours are widespread among Dubai realtors that the billionaire and ex-owner of Chelsea Football Club, Roman Abramovich, is in the market for a luxury base on the city’s coveted foreshore. One of his jets has been a regular visitor to the airbase, and a yacht linked to him has been moored in nearby Gulf waters. Abramovich’s property holdings are being scrutinised around the globe, including in the French territory of St Barts in the Caribbean, where he is a major holder of luxury homes in Gouverneur Bay, near compounds owned by other oligarchs. He is believed to have financed substantial upgrades to public facilities, including roads and car parking, winning the favour of local authorities. “It will be the same in Dubai,” said a real estate agent who has sold two luxury properties, valued up to $20m to Russian investors in the past three weeks. “They know how to deal with the local authorities and to make themselves good neighbours. “A lot of the new investors are very hush-hush,” said Pinto. “They will never purchase directly, they get companies to do it for them.” While oligarchs’ jets continue to shuttle between Moscow and Dubai, so do commercial flights. There is no sign of the money flow between the two cities slowing down and there has been little local reaction to a move earlier in March by the global financial crimes watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force, to put the UAE on its “grey” list, meaning the provenance of some money in the UAE could be considered opaque. Among bankers, power brokers and global tycoons, the UAE has long been known as a receptive environment for investment that asks few questions. A residency permit and a bank account can be obtained in 30 days following the registration of a company. Permanent residency can be purchased for the price of a luxury villa – about $1.5m. Employees of leading banks may soon be signing up. Goldman Sachs was among the first US banks to announce the closure of its Russian business. It had about 80 employees in Moscow prior to the conflict, roughly half of whom are now moving to Dubai. A small number of JP Morgan’s 160-strong Moscow workforce are also relocating, although many employees are still in Russia, unwinding operations there. It is understood the easy availability of Dubai visas has played a role in the choice to relocate. Private bank Rothschild, whose wealth management unit reportedly decided to stop accepting new Russian clients, is also said to be moving some of its Russia-based staff to the Emirates. The bank did not respond to a request for comment. The UAE government has claimed to have taken significant measures to regulate the inflow of money. Its ready acceptance of Russian wealth at a time of global scrutiny on Putin’s financial tsars may put that claim to the test. But even more open to challenge is the relationship between the UAE and Washington, as Emirati leaders edge closer towards China, which as well as being a geopolitical rival is emerging as the potential hub of an alternative financial system. The Chinese cross-border payment system, Cips, is being mooted as a replacement for Swift – a development that could change the nature of global finance and dilute the impact of sanctions on Russia. While such a move does not seem likely – at least in the short term, Emirati leaders have not been shy in showing their displeasure with US president Joe Biden, who they believe has shied away from a longstanding strategic partnership, at a time when Putin has been prepared to embrace them. The war in Yemen has widened the rift. In January, Houthi forces claimed responsibility for an apparent drone attack in Abu Dhabi that killed three people and left flames billowing from an oil storage site. “They have been particularly upset over Yemen, and the fact that they did not get a phone call from Biden after Abu Dhabi was hit by drones and rockets fitted by the Houthis,” said an expatriate in Dubai with knowledge of the government position. Julien Barnes Dacey, the head of the Middle East and North Africa programme at the European Council for Foreign Relations, said: “At face value UAE seems they think they can navigate around US sanctions but it may just be too early for them to have internalised what this western anti-Russian sanctions drive really means. “It’s hard to know how much it fits into the recent sense of Emirati hedging, and whether they are actively looking to send a message to Washington that they’re frustrated with the US position at large and are happy to go their own way moving forward.” In Dubai, bling is back. Boulevards that were silent during the peak of the pandemic are bustling with the roar of sports cars, some driven by locals, others by young Russians. Towering over them is the world’s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, which sparkles like a giant Disney castle with all manner of light shows. A Russian family are taking photographs of the building at sunset. “It will be red, blue and white soon,” one of the visitors says to his Emirati host, a reference to Russia’s tricolour flag. “I’ll arrange it,” the host replies with laughter.",News/World news,Dubai throws open the doors for the rich Russians escaping sanctions,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/26/dubai-throws-open-the-doors-for-the-rich-russians-escaping-sanctions
3/27/2022,"In 1974, knowing that he was, as he puts it, “a nervous individual” and afraid of dogs, the police put alsatians into Hugh Callaghan’s cell. They ordered them to attack him, before restraining them at the last minute. “I still have nightmares about it,” he says, now 92, sitting in the peaceful London home he shares with his partner, Adeline. There have been times, she says, when he has woken up three times a night, screaming. If he sees someone with an alsatian, he crosses the road to avoid it. This is not a tale from Lukashenko’s Belarus, but from Birmingham, England, and is one of many gruesome details of the case of the Birmingham Six, in which six men spent 16 years in prison for a crime of which they were entirely innocent. It is shocking not only for this fact, but also for the brutal methods of the police, and their decades-long efforts, with the help of some judges and sections of the media, to insist – in the face of mounting evidence to the contrary – on the men’s guilt. If you are British, it shakes any faith you might have in the country’s institutions of law and order, in which you might well have been brought up to believe. If you are under 45, you may know little of one of the worst miscarriages of justice of modern times. If you are older you may remember footage of their release, and media coverage of the case, but your grasp of the details might be hazy. You might, thanks to the misinformation of the police and some of the press, harbour some vague suspicion that they were after all a little bit guilty. For these reasons, it is important that the testimonies of Callaghan and the other victims continue to be heard. And, lest the story seemed to be over, the police recently applied for a court order against Chris Mullin, the journalist and later MP whose investigations eventually led to the acquittal of the six. The order was intended to force him to reveal the identity of one of the actual bombers, whom Mullin had interviewed on the promise of anonymity. He refused, arguing that protection of sources was essential to journalism, and without which he could not have uncovered the truth about the six. The court found in his favour last week. In 1974, Callaghan was one of many who had moved from his native Belfast to the British mainland, in search of better prospects of work. He led an ordinary life, working as a welder in a factory that made lighting. He liked going to the pub and watching Aston Villa. He lived with his wife and daughter in a small terraced council house. On 21 November, two bombs went off in the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern in the Town, two pubs in the centre of Birmingham, killing 21 people and injuring 182, the worst of many attacks in England in a sustained campaign by the IRA. Callaghan, who had been drinking in another bar nearby, was arrested at the front door of his house on the following evening and, like the rest of the six, was beaten, threatened and terrified by the police, and deprived of sleep and food until he agreed to sign a false confession. The following year he was tried along with the others, still expecting to be acquitted. “I couldn’t believe what the police did. They lied. They told things that I didn’t say.” He thought the court would believe his truth over their lies, but it didn’t. He was sent first to Winson Green prison, by chance a short distance from the factory where he used to work. “It was a hard-nut prison. I got some beatings in there from the screws. The other prisoners didn’t like you because they knew what you were in for.” He had hot tea and cans of food thrown in his face. The six were segregated from the others for their own protection. Later, though “word got around that we were innocent, then they were very nice”. What kept Callaghan going “was the music”. There “was nothing to sing about in prison but I couldn’t help it. I sang in the shower. A warden heard me and asked ‘would you join the choir?’ All the inmates took to me after that.” He sang Sweet Sixteen and White Christmas to them. Up on a charge in front of the governor, she asked him to sing Danny Boy, and he brought tears to her eyes. The Birmingham Six story was not only one of extreme police misconduct. What took it to an additional level of monstrosity were the actions of some of the judiciary, who seemed more concerned with upholding the reputation of the criminal justice system than seeking the truth. In 1980, the Master of the Rolls, Lord Denning, threw out a civil action that the six had brought against West Midlands Police. He described the possible revelation of police perjury and violence as “such an appalling vista that every sensible person would say, ‘It cannot be right that these actions should go any further.’” If the six had been hanged, he later said, “we shouldn’t have all these campaigns to get them released”. In 1987, after Mullin had produced mounting confirmation of the innocence of the six in a series of documentaries for Granada TV’s World in Action series, their case at last went back to the court of appeal. New witnesses spoke of police malpractice and the forensic scientist, whose evidence had helped convict the men, Frank Skuse, had been discredited. This wasn’t enough for the lord chief justice Lord Lane, who presided over the case: “The longer this case has gone on,” he said, “the more convinced this court has become that the verdict of the jury was correct.” The Sun crowed in support: “We would have been tempted to string ’em up years ago.” It took another appeal, after yet more evidence of their innocence had been found, finally to exonerate them. In March 1991 they walked out of the Old Bailey, Mullin in their centre, their hands aloft. “It was the best thing,” says Callaghan, “to hear that.” “That was a terrible ordeal,’’ strangers would tell Callaghan in the street, “I was sorry to hear about that.” Even then, the aspersions didn’t go away. A 1992 Sunday Telegraph headline reported “Sensational new evidence against the Six” which turned out to be valueless. In 1993, a criminal case against three of the police who investigated them was controversially dropped, on the basis that adverse publicity made a fair hearing impossible. Their leader, Det Supt George Reade, then told the Sunday Telegraph that “in our eyes their guilt is beyond doubt”, and expressed similar views in the Sun. Both newspapers, after lawyers for the six took action against them, printed apologies, although the Sun chose to run its on page three, below the daily photo of a topless model. Even years later, some mud continued to stick. “You’re one of the bad boys,” said a neighbour, when Callaghan moved into his current house a few years ago. To which it has to be said as clearly as possible: he was not and never has been a bad boy. Neither he nor any of the six had had anything to do with the crimes of which he was accused, as was proved as comprehensively and exhaustively as can be. Meanwhile, the police failed to make any progress finding the real culprits, which makes their recent court action smack of bad faith and perhaps vindictiveness. They were pursuing the 74-year-old Mullin for refusing to give them information which, if they had done their job nearly 50 years ago, or since, they could have found for themselves. The victims of their failures are not only the six but also survivors of the bombs and relatives of those killed, who have not seen the perpetrators brought to justice. It’s hard to be sure something similar couldn’t happen now. The case led to the overturning of several other miscarriage of justice cases, and significant changes to law and procedure. But the recent cases of the 700-plus post office workers wrongly prosecuted for theft, and of the police strip search of child Q, don’t inspire confidence. As for Callaghan, he’s remarkably calm after everything he has lived through, but he doesn’t forget. Recently, singing with the Irish Pensioners Choir at a St Patrick’s Day event in Trafalgar Square, he found himself flanked by policemen. He didn’t feel comfortable. “They can be so nice and pally,” he says, “but they can turn so quickly.”",News/UK news,Why the Birmingham Six’s story must not be forgotten,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/26/why-the-birmingham-six-story-must-not-be-forgotten
3/27/2022,"The family of Belly Mujinga, who died with Covid after she was allegedly spat and coughed at while working at a London station at the start of the pandemic, say they are still lacking key information nearly two years after her death. Their comments came as they marked her birthday on Saturday by adding a heart to the Covid Memorial Wall. The 47-year-old transport worker died on 5 April 2020 after an alleged assault by an unknown man at Victoria station little more than two weeks before, leaving behind her husband, Lusamba Katalay, and their daughter Ingrid, who was then 11. Lusamba Katalay, 62, said he and Ingrid, now 13, miss her greatly. “Life is not like before,” he said. He also criticised her employer, Govia Thameslink Railway, who he said has not done anything to help the case. “Now nobody tries to help the case to move forward,” he said. “I don’t know why they do this.” But he said it made him very happy to be able to celebrate his wife’s birthday, which would have been her 49th, and to commemorate her at the Covid memorial wall. “It gives me more hope,” he said. At the time, British Transport Police (BTP) interviewed a 57-year-old man in connection with the incident, but closed the case after concluding there was “no evidence to substantiate any criminal offences”. Following a public outcry, the Crown Prosecution Service later reviewed the evidence and possible lines of inquiry, but concluded there was insufficient evidence and no charges were brought. On Saturday, to mark Mujinga’s birthday, the family, MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy and campaigners from the Covid Bereavement Families Campaign and Justice for Belly Mujinga Campaign gathered at the Covid memorial wall to celebrate her life and renew their calls for justice. The family added a heart to the memorial wall with the words “Love Belly”. Speaking on behalf of the family, lawyer Lawrence Davies said: “We are seeking answers to why it was necessary for Belly to be on the station concourse and why key information was not handed over to the family.” As the two-year anniversary of her death approaches, Mujinga’s family still do not know the identity of the person behind the alleged assault or exactly what happened. While he said the family were moving forward, Davies, the CEO of Equal Justice Solicitors, said: “Finding a measure of justice would be invaluable to them … Just to know why he did it, why it happened, because it’s just inexplicable on many levels.” He said CCTV footage showed a large white man approaching Mujinga, who worked for Govia Thameslink Railway, and her colleague, then either coughing or spitting at them and shouting at them before backing off, pointing. He then stood in a queue and went on to go through the same motions again. “When you double back and do the same thing again, that can’t be involuntary, that’s got to be a conscious choice,” said Davies. “And they didn’t do anything to provoke him, so quite what it was remains to be seen.” The family is pursuing an inquest, due to take place in June, but it will only be permitted if the coroner can find expert evidence to show that Mujinga more likely than not contracted Covid at work. If the inquest is allowed to take place, they hope her alleged attacker will be named – and, if not, her lawyer plans to request the information from BTP, who he said are not releasing the name of the suspect. When she died, Davies said, she believed it was the incident that gave her Covid and wanted her husband to try to get justice. “She was 47, your average life expectancy is about 81, so she’s lost at least 34 years and left her daughter behind her and she was robbed of the opportunity of having that family life,” he said. BTP did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for comment.",News/World news,Belly Mujinga’s family still seeking answers two years after death,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/26/belly-mujinga-family-seeking-answers-two-years-after-death
3/27/2022,"The publisher of the News of the World has failed in its attempt to force a deadline on potential victims of the phone-hacking scandal to make claims against it. Rupert Murdoch’s News Group Newspapers (NGN), which published the now defunct newspaper as well as the Sun, asked for litigation to be brought to an end 15 years after the scandal broke. About 1,028 claims have already been settled, plus an additional 358 applications that were made to a compensation scheme run by parent company News International between 2011 and 2016. But NGN’s lawyers were rebuffed when they argued at a hearing in London that it is time to impose a final deadline on potential victims to file new claims against the organisation. The failed bid comes as the Sun recorded a loss of £51m last year. NGN spent £49m on legal fees and damages relating to historical phone-hacking allegations in the year to 27 June 2021. This compares with the £80m NGN spent the previous year. There could be as many as “20,000 to 25,000 potential victims of NGN’s unlawful information gathering” and there should be no cut-off date, lawyers representing a number of victims argued. David Sherborne, representing the claimant group, said NGN’s application for a final cut-off date was “misconceived”. He argued that the “vast majority of victims do not know they have a claim due to the intentionally covert nature of NGN’s unlawful information gathering and its deliberate concealment of the same”. Anthony Hudson QC, for NGN, told the court on Thursday: “We say after 15 years of litigation, the resolution and compromise of more than 1,000 claims, the enormous use of court time during that period, vast quantities of disclosure [of evidence] and the huge costs that have been incurred and paid, we suggest that now is the appropriate time to ensure that any intended claims are brought within a reasonable time and that the slow drip-feed of the evidence – which on the claimants’ approach could last many more years, possibly another decade – is brought to a conclusion.” The barrister said there have been about 45 hearings since 2016, taking up about 70 hours of court time, and that legal costs have been “exorbitant”, with total costs for the third tranche of the litigation alone reaching nearly £35m. He said allegations had been in the public domain since former News of the World journalist Clive Goodman was arrested in 2006 and that it would be “difficult for anyone living in this country to be unaware” of the phone-hacking scandal. But giving judgment on Friday, Mr Justice Fancourt said he did not agree with NGN’s submission that the majority of potential victims already know they could make a claim. The judge said: “More claims are now being brought that do not arise from an article being published. Even when claimants did have an article published about them, it is not obvious this was how the information was gathered.” He added that new claimants were still learning of potential claims after appearing as witnesses in other claimants’ cases, but said the court’s position may change in the future. The court heard that there are currently 52 claims registered, with a further 436 claims at the pre-action letter stage and 82 more “in the pipeline”.",News/Media,News of the World publisher fails in bid to end phone-hacking claims,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/26/news-of-the-world-publisher-fails-in-bid-to-end-phone-hacking-claims-rupert-murdoch
