3/3/2022,"This story has been updated with new information from the Pentagon and United Nations. Ukraine armed forces have been striking that long line of Russian troops heading to Kyiv while the Russians have used thermobaric weapons against Ukrainian cities, the head of Ukraine’s defense intelligence agency tells Military Times. “We are striking the enemy’s columns,” Brig. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov told Military Times in an exclusive interview Wednesday morning. “We burn many columns of the enemy.” The strikes, he said, are being conducted by Ukraine Su-24 and Su-25 fighter jets, artillery and missile barrages. “My intelligence officers and agents are directing and calling the strikes,” he said. Marine Lt. Col. Anton Semelroth, a Pentagon spokesman said Wednesday morning he “would not speak to intel assessments.” Speaking to reporters Wednesday afternoon on the condition of anonymity, a senior defense official said the Pentagon has indications Ukraine forces are targeting the convoy in an attempt to stymie what officials believe is Russia’s ultimate goal: to occupy Kyiv and install a puppet government. The official spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity. [Ukraine jets hit Russian column; Russia has used thermobarics, Ukraine military says] “We’ve seen indications that at times and at certain places, the convoys may have been resisted by Ukrainian forces and I think I have to leave it at that,” the official said. “But we’ve seen indications that we are in no position to refute [Ukraine claims they have hit the convoy].” Ukraine invasion live updates: March 2 The Russian troops staged around the outside of Ukraine’s capital city appear to be in a holding pattern of some kind, a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Tuesday. Formations that had been moving toward Kyiv are essentially in the same spot today as they were Monday, the official said, roughly 17 miles outside the city center. “We believe that that’s for a number of reasons,” the official said. “Obviously, the resistance that they’re facing, the fuel and sustainment problems that they’re having. We are also picking up signs that they’re having problems feeding their troops, that they’re not only running out of gas, but they are running out of food.” The Pentagon’s assessment echoes multiple reports from recent days that Russian troops are looking for fuel and sustenance as they roll toward Kyiv. There’s also the possibility, the official said, that the Russians are taking a strategic pause to regroup, possibly after a stiffer defense than anticipated from the Ukrainian armed forces. Budanov also told Military Times that the Russians have been using thermobaric weapons in the assault on Kharkiv and near Kyiv. They were fired, he said, by TOS-1M weapons systems. Thermobaric weapons produce more heat and overpressure than conventional weapons by exploding a vapor in the blast zone, according to the Journal of Military and Veterans’ Health. Such weapons create tremendous damage to the human body, according to the journal. The Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C., did not immediately return a request seeking comment on both claims by Budanov. Human Rights Watch condemned Russia’s reported used of the weapons a year earlier in Chechnya in 2000, according to The Guardian, as “a dangerous escalation” with “important humanitarian implications”. The Guardian described the weapons as effective at their “specific purpose” of “primarily destroying defensive positions.” While they would not be used to penetrate a tank, they could be a “”very destructive weapon” against an apartment complex or other building. “They are not illegal, even though their effects can be pretty horrific because of … creating a vacuum and sucking the air out of the lungs of defenders,” Marcus Hellyer, senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, told The Guardian. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. envoy to the United Nations, confirmed the Russians have used thermobaric weapons, also known as vacuum bombs. “We have seen videos of Russian forces moving exceptionally lethal weaponry into Ukraine which has no place on the battlefield,” the U.S. envoy to the U.N., Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told the General Assembly, according to The Hill. “That includes cluster munitions and vacuum bombs, which are banned under the Geneva Convention.” She echoed allegations made on Monday — by Ukraine’s Ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova to American lawmakers — that Russia was using in its attacks on Ukraine a thermobaric weapon, according to The Hill. A senior U.S. defense official on Tuesday said the Pentagon has seen weapons systems that can launch themobaric weapons inside Ukraine, but could not confirm the thermobaric weapons are actually in Ukraine or their use. Semelroth on Wednesday told Military Times there was no update to that assessment. That official on Wednesday “had nothing more to add.” Military Times Pentagon Bureau Chief Meghann Myers contributed to this report.",World/Air Force Times,"Ukraine jets hit Russian column; Russia has used thermobarics, Ukraine military says",https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-jets-hit-russian-column-131510676.html
3/3/2022,"A podcaster jokingly asked Mark Zuckerberg to complete a CAPTCHA to prove he's not a robot. The Meta CEO circled the squares that included traffic lights on a piece of paper. Zuckerberg has fielded jokes for years that he acts robotically, and he's acknowledged that he does. Meta CEO and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has long fielded online jokes that he acts like a robot, and an interviewer recently referenced them before a two-hour chat. Video: Facebook whistleblower accused the company of 'moral bankruptcy' Podcaster and computer scientist Lex Fridman published his interview with the executive on Monday, covering a wide range of topics from the metaverse and problems with social media, to his nightly routine with his two young daughters. Fridman jokingly asked Zuckerberg to complete a sort of CAPTCHA, the image puzzles users are prompted to solve in order to prove to a computer that they're human, not a robot. ""Can you circle all the traffic lights, please? Fridman asked Zuckerberg, handing him a piece of paper. The CEO appeared genuinely amused and grinned widely as he circled the correct squares. ""You actually did it,"" Fridman said with a laugh. ""That is a very impressive performance."" Some have referred to Zuckerberg as ""Zuckerborg"" for his communications skills that can sometimes come of as rehearsed or impersonal. And the internet had a field day making memes of him after he was grilled in front of Congress in 2018 over his company's handling of millions of users' data in what has become known as the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Many of the online posts compared him to the android character Data from ""Star Trek."" Even ""Saturday Night Live"" ran a parody in 2018 with cast member Alex Moffat playing a robotic Zuckerberg. For his part, Zuckerberg acknowledged his robotic cadence in a 2019 interview with Lester Holt of NBC News. The reporter asked the CEO if he was ""the best communicator for Facebook."" Zuckerberg responded: ""Historically, I've had a very hard time expressing myself. I just come across as robotic. This is one of the things that... I'm growing up, I need to get better at, in running this company.""

3/3/2022,"Several demoralized Russian troops captured in Ukraine were allowed to call home over the weekend to tell their families they were safe and profess confusion about why they were sent to war. ""Mama and Papa, I didn't want to come here. They forced me to,"" a Russian soldier said in videos purporting to show the phone calls that were taken by Ukraine's Interior Ministry and posted on YouTube. Videos and stills of captured or surrendered Russian troops also were posted on the Ukrainian Security Service's Facebook page. The posting of the videos showing captured Russian troops raised questions about whether Ukraine had violated Article 13 of the Geneva Conventions, calling for the protection of prisoners of war ""against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity."" Read Next: Biden to Spotlight Vets Health in Address to Congress, Pushing Burn Pit, Mental Health Help The captured Russian soldiers, and any Ukrainians captured by the Russians, were entitled to humane treatment and protections under the law of war and the Geneva Conventions, said Gary Solis, a Vietnam veteran, retired Marine judge advocate general and author of the book, ""The Law of Armed Conflict."" ""It's a violation"" of Geneva to post the videos, but not what would be considered a ""grave breach"" to be taken up by a war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Solis said. ""Anybody who is captured is a prisoner of war"" and must be shielded from abuse and provided medical treatment as a lawful combatant, he added. ""Clearly, the Russians who were captured were wearing uniforms."" He compared what the Ukrainians had done more to a misdemeanor than a felony, and also noted that there was a positive humanitarian aspect of the videos in showing ""proof of life"" to the families of the captured troops. The International Criminal Court in The Hague has made no mention of Ukrainian actions since Russia invaded last week, but on Monday, ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan said in a press release that he planned to begin an investigation ""as rapidly as possible"" into possible war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Russia tied to the bombing and shelling of civilian buildings. In English subtitles added to one video by Ukrainian authorities, another Russian soldier tried to explain his plight to his mother: ""Hello, hello, Mom? Hi, did you recognize me? I am in the territory of Ukraine. I've been taken captive but I'm alright."" In addition to the videos of soldiers calling home, the Interior Ministry showed off-camera interrogators questioning the troops who mostly appeared to be unharmed and speaking freely, but some had cuts and bruises on their faces. One soldier appeared under sheets in what was either an aid station or hospital bed and said ""I got here not knowing"" what the mission was, according to the Ukrainian translation. ""I didn't imagine what will happen here. There was no need to come here."" He said ""our convoy got under fire"" and now ""my legs are broken."" He had a wife and two children back in Russia, the soldier said, and ""I pray to God to recover."" A common theme among the soldiers was that they were conscripts, with little concept of why they were sent into Ukraine and-or what their mission was once they crossed the border. One Russian soldier said: ""We came here under the pretext of doing military exercises. We were not planning to make war on Ukraine. I am alive and healthy as a captive, and my message is to stop the war in Ukraine. It is nonsense; people are dying."" Ukrainian officials gave no overall figure for how many Russian troops may have been captured, but Ukraine's Interior Ministry reported Tuesday that 5,710 Russian troops had been killed since the Feb. 24 invasion began. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov declined Sunday to give numbers on how many Russian troops had been killed or captured but said more Ukrainians than Russians had been killed, Russia's Tass news agency reported. ""There are dead and wounded among our comrades,"" Konashenkov said without giving any figures, but added that Ukraine's losses were ""many times"" more than Russia's -- again without giving specifics. Although they may not be wearing uniforms, the civilians would be considered lawful combatants so long as they were wearing a sign or symbol of their allegiance, and simply carrying a weapon would qualify as such a sign, Solis said.

3/3/2022,"If an alien civilization far more advanced than anything on Earth existed thousands of years ago, would they have embedded a piece of metal inside someone’s skull? That is, at least, what this looks like. An (undoubtedly human) skull from Peru, which was donated to the Museum of Osteology in Oklahoma from a private collection, is now the object of controversy because of a mysterious metal implant. The elongated skull almost looks alien, but head-binding was a common practice in Peru and other parts of the ancient world. It has not yet been carbon dated or examined up close by any archaeologists. Whether the implant is authentic raises questions. But why is there even a gaping hole in the first place? It could the been blunt-force trauma. It could have also been trepanation. Long before ibuprofen existed, it was thought cutting an opening into the skull would relieve pressure from fluid that caused headaches. Archaeologist John Verano of Tulane University, an expert in trepanned skulls and also author of the book Holes in the Head, is not convinced the piece of metal had any medical use back then. “Forgeries have been pretty easy to recognize because they made no sense in terms of surgical treatments,” he told SYFY WIRE. ""I'm highly dubious; it is probably a cranium ‘accessorized’ to increase its value to a collector.” Photo: The Museum of Osteology Verano had previously seen skulls that could have been forgeries in a Peruvian museum. That particular museum also has a reputation for fakes. In one of these skulls that he observed, the trepanation was real based on the linear way the opening was cut, but it was then filled with gold. Remember that scene from Game of Thrones where Khal Drogo poured molten gold onto the head of a screaming Viserys? It looked as if the gold had been molten at the time the hole was plugged — and had this person been alive, it would have probably felt like Viserys’ demise. Trepanation sounds gruesome, but before there was so much as a semblance of modern medicine, it was the only headache relief that many ancient peoples could think of. If the extra fluid could ooze out, then the pressure would be relieved, but what was problematic about this was that you would still be left with a literal hole in your head. The procedure ended up being fatal for some. Others who underwent it survived, as evidenced by signs of healing in ancient trepanned skulls, but they were especially vulnerable to infection without antibiotics. “The skull does show multiple fracture lines that mark a serious blow to the head, although he survived the injury, as marked by healing of the margins of the fracture,” Verano said. ""Unfortunately, if there is a trepanation under the metal it is not visible, so it's unclear if there is in fact evidence of surgery.” Your brain is just about the last place you would want an infection. It is impossible to tell whether survivors of trepanation died from that or something else, but there was a high risk. It is possible that the owner of this skull had not undergone a trepanation at all and instead was the victim of severe head trauma. What they succumbed to is and may remain a mystery. It might have been meant for the afterlife, though that is unlikely. Verano knows of only one trepanned skull whose hole was covered with metal that was apparently a grave offering. In Holes in the Head, Verano describes a Paracas mummy from Peru’s southern coast. There had been a trepanation performed on the forehead, and the wound was covered with a thin plate of hammered gold, but the plate itself was clearly not made to be an implant. Though many archaeologists thought it was evidence that ancient Peruvians used some sort of implant to keep the skull protected, the problem is that the patient did not survive the trepanation. Meaning, if this had been cranioplasty — something it didn’t appear like — then it failed. Photo: The Museum of Osteology  ""X-rays probably won't help, because they won't penetrate the metal and show what's under it,” said Verano. ""If the metal could be somehow delicately removed it would be helpful, but this might damage the skull. An elemental analysis of the metal could be informative.” He added that he had never seen metalwork like this from ancient Peru. So is it a previously unknown innovation? Blatant forgery? Aliens? The answer is still buried in the past.     ",Science/SYFY,Is the space-age metal implant in this ancient skull for real?,https://news.yahoo.com/space-age-metal-implant-ancient-010845806.html
3/3/2022,"Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) was booed by her colleagues for heckling President Joe Biden as he spoke about Afghanistan and Iraq veterans and his late son, Beau Biden, during his State of the Union address. Biden was speaking about the effects of “burn pits” that “incinerated wastes of war — medical and hazard material, jet fuel, and more,” saying some veterans battle “a cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin. I know.” After that remark, Boebert shouted, “You put them in, 13 of them,” referencing 13 service members who died last year in a bomb attack in Kabul. Democrats booed Boebert after the outburst. Biden continued without acknowledging Boebert’s comment, mentioning his son, who died of brain cancer in 2015, by name. “I don’t know for sure if the burn pit that he lived near ... in Iraq, and earlier than that, in Kosovo, was the cause of his brain cancer, or the disease of so many of our troops, but I am committed to finding out everything we can,” he said. Boebert tweeted about the moment after the speech, claiming she “couldn’t stay silent” when she heard Biden refer to “flag-draped coffins.” Earlier in the speech, Boebert and her colleague Rep. Majorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) attempted to start a “build the wall” chant as Biden spoke about immigration, but it didn’t take off. The Daily Beast’s Matt Fuller reports someone told them to “sit down.” Boebert also made a sartorial statement during Tuesday’s event, wearing a shawl featuring the phrase “drill baby drill.” Outbursts from lawmakers during presidential addresses aren’t particularly common. In 2009, Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.) made headlines for shouting “You lie!” at President Barack Obama during a health care address in front of a joint session of Congress. The taunt was later used against him by his own constituents at campaign events in 2017. This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

3/3/2022,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexico will not impose any economic sanctions on Russia for invading Ukraine, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Tuesday. He also criticized what he called censorship of Russian state-sponsored media by social media companies. ""We are not going to take any sort of economic reprisal because we want to have good relations with all the governments in the world,"" Lopez Obrador told a news conference. Lopez Obrador's position stands in contrast to the broad international sanctions imposed on Russia for President Vladimir Putin's actions. Russia has built strong links to various governments in Latin America, especially authoritarian administrations in Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, but its ties with Mexico are seen to be limited due to the strong U.S.-Mexico relations. The Mexican and U.S. economies are deeply intertwined. But leftist leader Lopez Obrador has at times had testy relations with the United States and has criticized U.S. foreign policy. Late on Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he spoke with Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard by phone, ""reiterating the worldwide call for the withdrawal of Russia's troops from Ukraine,"" he said in a tweet. Ebrard in a separate tweet said he shared Mexico's perspective on Ukraine during the call, which he described as friendly. Ebrard last week condemned the invasion and demanded Russia end its military operations in Ukraine, marking a tougher stance than Lopez Obrador's call for dialogue. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation."" Lopez Obrador's comments on Tuesday morning came in response to a question about the interest in Mexico of Russia's second-largest oil producer Lukoil and Russian airline Aeroflot. Lukoil said on Friday it has completed its acquisition of a 50% operator interest in an offshore oil project in Mexico, part of its drive to expand its global reach. The Mexican president also criticized what he characterized as the censorship of Russian state media. ""I don't agree with the fact that media from Russia or any country is censored,"" Lopez Obrador said. Alphabet Inc's Google barred Russia's state-owned media outlet RT and other channels from receiving money for ads on their websites, apps and YouTube videos, similar to a move by Facebook after the invasion of Ukraine.

3/3/2022,"By Mari Saito and Elaine Lies TOKYO (Reuters) -Keiichi Kurogi was one of dozens of men in Japan who offered to join an ""international legion"" to fight Russian invaders after Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for volunteers. Kurogi, a 39-year-old office worker who lives in southwestern Japan, told Reuters he rang the Ukrainian embassy on Monday after seeing its plea for volunteers on Twitter. ""When I saw images of elderly men and women in Ukraine holding guns and going to the front, I felt I should go in their place,"" he said. The embassy declined Kurogi's offer to fight, telling him that he lacked the necessary military experience. As of Tuesday, 70 Japanese men - including 50 former members of Japan's Self-Defense Forces and two veterans of the French Foreign Legion - had applied to be volunteers, the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper said, quoting a Tokyo company handling the volunteers. A spokesperson for the Ukrainian Embassy acknowledged receiving calls from people ""wanting to fight for Ukraine,"" but declined to give further details. A Feb. 28 social media post from the embassy thanked Japanese for their many inquiries about volunteering but added a proviso. ""Any candidates for this must have experience in Japan's Self-Defence Forces or have undergone specialised training,"" it said. In a new post on Twitter on Wednesday, the Ukrainian embassy in Japan said it was looking for volunteers with medical, IT, communication, or firefighting experience. It was not immediately clear if the volunteer positions were remote or involved travelling to Ukraine. Japan has told its nationals to put off travel to Ukraine for any reason, a warning reiterated on Wednesday by Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno, who said he was aware of the reports about the volunteers. ""The Japanese foreign ministry has issued an evacuation advisory for all of Ukraine and we want people to stop all travel to Ukraine, regardless of the purpose of their visit,"" he told a news conference. ""We are communicating with the Ukrainian embassy in Japan and pointed out that an evacuation advisory is in place."" Japan said on Wednesday it would temporarily close its embassy in Kyiv given increasing dangers in the capital. JAPAN GIVES The war in Ukraine has stirred strong emotions in Japan, which has a post-war pacifist constitution that has been reinterpreted in recent years to allow Japan to exercise collective self-defense or aid allies under attack. Hundreds gathered for a protest against the Russian invasion last week in Tokyo, while the Ukrainian embassy said it collected $17 million in donations from some 60,000 people in Japan after it put out an online request for help. One of them was Ryoga Seki, a 23-year-old studying computer science at a graduate school in Osaka, who donated an entire month's wages from his part-time tutoring job - 100,000 yen ($868) - to Ukraine. ""There are many people here, like me, who want to do something but can't move around right now,"" he said, adding that it was his first-ever major donation and the maximum amount he could transfer at one time from his bank. As for Kurogi, he is adamant that he would volunteer again if Ukraine changed its requirements. ""I'm from a generation that does not know war at all,"" he said. ""It's not that I want to go to a war, it's more that I would rather go than see children forced to carry guns.""
