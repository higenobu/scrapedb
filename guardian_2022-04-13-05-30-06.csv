4/13/2022,"Comedian and actor Gilbert Gottfried has died at the age of 67. His family announced his death via his Twitter page after a long illness. Gottfried was known for his standup comedy and for roles in films including Aladdin and Problem Child. “In addition to being the most iconic voice in comedy, Gilbert was a wonderful husband, brother, friend and father to his two young children,” the statement read. “Although today is a sad day for all of us, please keep laughing as loud as possible in Gilbert’s honour.” A representative for the late star told TMZ that he died of a heart abnormality called ventricular tachycardia due to myotonic dystrophy type 2. Gottfried was discovered as a young standup and starred in one season of Saturday Night Live in 1980. This led to film roles, including Beverly Hills Cop II and the Problem Child series. His unmistakeable voice led to a great deal of voice work, most notably playing the parrot Iago in Aladdin, which he later referred to as his “all-time favourite job”. He was also known for the kids show Cyberchase and for voicing the duck in the Aflac commercials. His screen roles also included Ren and Stimpy, Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events, Dr Dolittle, A Million Ways to Die in the West and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. He was also known for pushing the boundaries, making risky jokes, including a controversial 9/11 joke at the roast of Hugh Hefner. He also recently weighed in on the Chris Rock/Will Smith Oscars story, tweeting a picture of himself with Rock, writing: “Which is the worst crime? Chris Rock being physically assaulted or Chris Rock telling a joke?” “I can say any bad thing about another person, but if they start making fun of the shirt I’m wearing, I go, ‘Oh come on, that’s just – it’s one thing to joke, but now you’re taking it to a really cruel area,’ he said, laughing, in a 2017 interview. “So I’m as hypocritical as anybody.” Seinfeld star Jason Alexander has paid tribute on Twitter writing: “Gilbert Gottfried made me laugh at times when laughter did not come easily. What a gift. I did not know him well but I loved what he shared with me. My best wishes and sympathy to his family.” “Gilbert Gottfried was never not funny,” comedian Dane Cook tweeted. “He was a lovely guy, always friendly & made many people happy.” Gottfried is survived by his wife, Dara Kravitz, and two children.",Arts/Culture,"Gilbert Gottfried, comedian and actor, dies aged 67",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/12/gilbert-gottfried-dies-aged-67-comedian-actor
4/13/2022,"When the US government document landed, in the early hours of Tuesday morning Dubai time, it must have felt like a haymaker exploding on Daniel Kinahan’s chin. Across 1400 taut words it revealed all the addresses, the numbers of fake passports IDs, and the alleged crimes and misdemeanours of one of the most powerful men in boxing. Then, on Tuesday morning, came another spiralling blow, with the US Department of State placing a $5m bounty on his head. Speaking in Dublin, the US ambassador to Ireland, Claire Cronin, said the reward would be provided for “information leading to the financial disruption of the Kinahans, or the arrest or conviction” of Daniel Kinahan, his father, Christopher Sr, and brother, Christopher Jr. Tackling the Kinahans “is an urgent priority for President Biden and the US government” she said. For someone used to operating in the shadows, after fleeing Ireland for the United Arab Emirates, it must have come as a hell of a blunt shock. But Kinahan’s unease should also have been mirrored by many in boxing. For years they welcomed and accommodated him as he sportswashed his reputation by establishing himself as a key figure within the sport. Yet there was always a strange duality here. With every passing year, the criminal allegations against Kinahan mounted – as far back as 2018 he was named in the Dublin high court as the head of a £1bn drugs and weapon smuggling cartel. And yet, at the same time, his power and influence in boxing only grew. He became a friend and adviser to Tyson Fury. A man people did business with. Perhaps promoters and broadcasters told themselves they had no choice given the huge stable of fighters in the MTK Global Agency that he co-founded. Perhaps Kinahan’s lack of criminal convictions – and denials of any wrongdoing – also made them think they had cover. But people such as the WBC president, Mauricio Sulaimán, who recently praised Kinahan for “improving boxers’ lives in a special way”, have no such excuses. Of course the sport was aware of Kinahan’s reputation. Boxers are not naive. However they appreciated the fact that he was generous, straight, and looked after fighters – which is often a rarity in the sport and made them ignore all the other stuff. But not even boxing will be able to jab and feint its way out facing some hard truths now. Not when the US government states bluntly that the “Kinahan Organised Crime Group smuggles deadly narcotics, including cocaine, to Europe, and is a threat to the entire licit economy through its role in international money laundering”. In a statement the US also noted: “Criminal groups like the KOCG prey on the most vulnerable in society and bring drug-related crime and violence, including murder, to the countries in which they operate.” For good measure, Kinahan is named directly too – as someone “who sources large quantities of cocaine from South America, plays an integral part in organizing the supply of drugs in Ireland, and is attempting to facilitate the importation of cocaine into the United Kingdom. Daniel Kinahan is known to have used false identity documents”. Sanctions are now in place which bar US banks and companies from doing business with Kinahan and his associates. As Gregory Gatjanis, a senior US official, put it: “Today, the Kinihans join the ranks of the Camorra and Japan’s yakuza.” Speaking at a press conference, the Garda Síochána commissioner, Drew Harris, issued a direct warning to those in sport who have ties to Kinahan. “In respect of individuals, and very prominent sporting individuals, who are obviously in some way connected with this grouping. I would say you need to look to your sport, you need to look to your fans and you need to think of your own reputation, because this is a very serious announcement,” he said. Kinahan, he said, “couldn’t “hide from justice forever”. A similar message was conveyed by the assistant commissioner, John O’Driscoll, who condemned Kinahan’s standing in the sport, saying that his influence was “destroying or attempting to destroy a sport that is so important to inner city communities”. It is a warning that has been issued multiple times before. Perhaps this time boxing will finally listen. Then again, this is boxing.",Sport/Sport,Boxing simply cannot jab and feint its way out of Daniel Kinahan problem | Sean Ingle,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/12/boxing-simply-cannot-jab-and-feint-its-way-out-of-daniel-kinahan-problem

4/13/2022,"New Zealand house prices have experienced their biggest quarterly drop in a decade, raising some hopes of a cooling market for those who have long been locked out by sky-high property prices. But the same forces that are pushing prices down – inflation, high cost of living, and rising interest rates – are also hitting prospective buyers, especially those at the bottom end of the market. After years of rocketing prices, price data from across the country is now observing some of the largest drops and slowdowns since the aftermath of the global financial crisis. Valuation company QV found the average home decreased in value by -0.6% nationally in the first quarter of the year, with the national average value now sitting at $1,046,636. The decrease, while small, comes after years of steeply rising prices, and ANZ economists say the mood among buyers has shifted dramatically – from “fear of missing out” to “I’m not paying that”. “With the massive rise in listings over the past couple of months the balance of power has shifted firmly into the hands of buyers, after such a prolonged period of it being a sellers’ market,” QV General Manager David Nagel said. ANZ economists are now projecting a 10% drop in prices over the year. While that would be easily the biggest drop in prices in the last decade, it is still far from returning New Zealand house prices to what they were even a couple of years ago – median house prices rose 31% in the year to July 2021. The biggest drops are in the country’s main centres, which Nagel said were “currently taking the brunt of the impact of rising interest rates, high living costs, and tightening bank credit.” The Real Estate Institute reported in February that median house prices in Auckland had fallen by nearly 20% since their peak in November, from $1.54mn in November to $1.25m in February. At first glance, those shifts are good news for prospective homeowners – housing affordability has long been considered a crisis in New Zealand, where houses in the largest cities cost several times the average annual income. But rising interest rates, higher cost of living and tougher lending rules – the same forces that are pushing prices down – are also keenly felt by first homebuyers, especially those on lower incomes. In 2021, coming off years of rises, many prospective buyers were desperate simply to get into the market, in case it continued to rise and the bottom rung of the ladder rose out of their reach. “There were a lot of people who had this fear of missing out … a lot of people were really trying to get in, to stretch and to make it work,” says Gemma Rasmussen of Consumer NZ, an independent non-profit that surveys consumer sentiment. Now, with banks forecasting rising interest rates and dropping prices, buyers are newly concerned about stretching beyond their means. “We’re now at a point where people have the fear of paying too much money,” Rasmussen says. “There’s a fear around interest rates going up and that starts making people a lot more cagey around purchasing. Compare that sentiment [with] three or four months ago – it was completely different.” Consumer NZ surveying found just 16% of New Zealanders thought it was a “good time to buy” in February 2022, down from 25% in October 2021. Conversely, 58% thought it was a bad time to buy, up 8 percentage points. New Zealanders were increasingly concerned that a house might not hold its value – an increasing portion believed homes would drop in value over the next year, and fewer thought it would increase. 83% overall thought the housing market was still either “overinflated” or “out of control”. A mixture of factors are driving the growing hesitancy for buyers. Some of the change is being aided by a slate of government reforms in 2021, that aimed to cool the market. Those included tougher lending rules for banks, which saw many mortgage applicants turned down for too much “discretionary spending”, and phasing out mortgage interest as a tax-deductible cost. New Zealand is also experiencing record-high inflation, and increasing anxiety over the cost of living. High inflation rates mean the banks are projecting further rises in mortgage interest rates – which could push owners who are already struggling to cover mortgage payments over the edge. “For the people who have overextended, there could be a degree of nervousness for them about now sitting with a really high mortgage and having these high cost of living costs, also knowing that they may not be able to go on and make the sale,” Rasmussen said. “Six months ago, the primary concerns for the nation, [were] around Covid-19, and in particular concern about an overinflated housing market. Now the top concern for New Zealanders is around just purely the financial cost of living. People are really finding that to be a massive strain.”",News/World news,New Zealand house prices are starting to fall – but many buyers remain locked out,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/new-zealand-house-prices-are-starting-to-fall-but-many-buyers-remain-locked-out
4/13/2022,"It had all been going so well. After his successful, surprise weekend trip to Ukraine, Boris Johnson had been enjoying his newfound status as “The Lion of Kyiv” during a few days off at Chequers. Then had come the news that the Metropolitan police had now issued more than 50 fixed penalty notices (FPN). And that’s before they had even got to work on the really serious parties. If only he had put the ruthless and forensic Christopher Geidt in charge of the investigation. Then no one would have been any the wiser about any of the parties. Not that there had been any parties. The Suspect had always been very clear about this. In as much as he had ever been very clear about anything. First he had told parliament that he had been as furious as the rest of the country that staff at No 10 could have been having parties that he knew nothing about. Then, when it had emerged he had actually attended most of the parties he knew nothing about, he had said that he hadn’t been aware that the parties were parties. Because the presence of cakes, booze, trestle tables laden with food and empties littering the flowerbeds weren’t much of a clue. Round about lunchtime, things got a whole lot worse when Johnson discovered that he was one of the crims to be given an FPN. The Suspect was no longer the Suspect. He was the Convict. It was outrageous. Just because he had passed the law forbidding everyone from meeting up during lockdown, there was no reason to imagine that he was expected to obey the rules. Those had only been for the Little People. The suckers. Narcissists like Johnson got to do as they chose. Theirs was a life governed by their own own exceptionalism. It hadn’t helped that Carrie had also been given a FPN. Wilfred and Romy would just have to get used to the fact that both their parents were criminals. And he’d have to find out if Lulu Lytle had also been fined as she would be sure to add it to her bill. As it was she deserved a £10,000 fine for crimes against interior design. Not that he would be paying hers or anybody else’s, of course. Least of all his own. That’s what David Brownlow was for. The only upside was that Rishi Sunak had also been issued with an FPN. The chancellor had been in tears when he had phoned. “What shall I do?” he sobbed. “Just pay it,” the Convict had replied. “It’s alright for you. You’ve got loads of dosh. You can afford it. And you’ll probably find a way to offset it against tax in whatever country – Mauritius, is it? – your family files their returns.” Sunak had then gone on to have a meltdown about having lied to parliament about not having been to a party. What a baby. “I was categoric about it,” he had said. Whatevs. Personally, the Convict couldn’t see what was so bad about having deliberately misled parliament. It was the sort of thing that he did the whole time and none of the Tory MPs seemed that bothered about it. He’d always found that the best way of getting out of a lie was to double down with an even bigger lie. And if that didn’t work, just keep lying until people got bored. But if Rishi wanted to make a martyr of himself – imagine the absurdity of a cabinet minister being expected to have some principles! – then he could be his guest. The chancellor could learn the hard way that Johnson had the knack of invariably dragging anyone close to him down to his level in the end. As for the Convict, he wasn’t going anywhere. Instead he would let some of his useful idiots fill the void. Thank God for Michael Fabricant and Nadine Dorries. While other Tory MPs and cabinet ministers were totally silent – it was as if the Conservative party was totally paralysed with indecision: it’s not every day your leader makes history by being the first prime minister to be found guilty of breaking his own laws. And while MPs knew he ought to resign they didn’t dare to be the first to suggest it as there were no obvious alternatives – these two alone held the fort. Micky F managed to insult every doctor and nurse by suggesting they had spent most of lockdown pissed while Nad had basically restated Boris’s divine right to do what the fuck he liked. Nadine was a trooper. Even if Boris killed someone she would find a way of making it the victim’s fault. But come 6pm the Convict was ready to record a short television clip. He was deeply apologetic, he said. Though he didn’t sound like it. Rather, as he toyed with the Toddler haircut, he seemed to blame the police for not having interpreted the law in his favour. In BorisWorld, ignorance of the law is a valid excuse, it seems. Johnson just wanted to move on. It would be wrong to resign now because of Ukraine. Though arguably the UK needed a leader with a strong moral compass more than ever these days. And it wasn’t as if the UK didn’t have a track record of replacing leaders during wartime. Not that we are at war. Johnson was markedly less comfortable when facing questions. Could everyone just forget about the fact that he had lied so many times he had forgotten what he had lied about and broken his own rules on multiple occasions, he begged. After all, he had lied in good faith because he had really, really believed his own lies. Honest. And if we could just ignore the fact he is totally untrustworthy, he would get on with not dealing with the cost of living and energy crisis. I mean, he’d only been to a party for nine minutes: it’s going down all the time. Before too long he won’t have been to it – so surely that didn’t count. Well, fine. Then what excuses would the Convict come up with when he was fined in the future for attending those parties that went on for hours and where everyone got thoroughly shitfaced. The other parties that Johnson insisted never took place. Boris shook his head. He would lie about that as and when the need arose.",News/Politics,"The Suspect becomes the Convict, but the ‘Lion of Kyiv’ is sure to keep lying | John Crace",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/12/boris-johnson-suspect-becomes-convict-but-lion-kyiv-sure-keep-lying-fixed-penalty-notice-party
