1/26/2022,"“Cold,” one news outlet reported of the young woman’s expression. “Frosty,” said another. “Visibly uncomfortable,” ran a subheading, describing the manner that affected her obliged pose beside the man – hung back, unsmiling, eyes hooded with mistrust. Yes, the scene described was of outgoing Australian of the Year, survivor advocate Grace Tame, obliged into a photo event with prime minister Scott Morrison. The occasion was a formal morning tea to commemorate the end of Tame’s eventful year in the AOTY role.  “Tense,” explained the copy under the published photographs. Twitter, of course, is under no such expectation of equanimity or politeness as old mastheads. “Iconic behaviour,” said Brisbane artist @nordacious of the resulting photograph. “Dear @TamePunk, I do believe you have unlocked a new level of legendary status today,” echoed trade union leader @SallyMcManus. “Fuckin Lolllllllll,” wrote performer @ChristieWhelan. Tame herself did not make a comment at the event. There was no ruckus and she did shake the prime minister’s hand – yet one imagines the prime ministerial advisory circle need only have seen the look in Tame’s eyes to know the damage was done. Never has Australia had a prime ministership so self-conscious of image-based branding. Morrison’s most intimate encounters with meal preparation, poultry housing and even his own pants are so relentlessly thrust into the national consciousness that one longs to de-invent photography. You can understand the political energy for an aggressive visual strategy. It was footage of another young woman’s refusal to demur to the PM’s authority that dealt Morrison’s “daggy dad” image such damage some deadly fires and a whole killer pandemic ago. Remember fire-ravaged Cobargo? The prime ministerial press office would prefer you didn’t, and would you prefer you to look at this curry … these Christmas lights … or barre. The image of the reticent Tame on Tuesday was so reminiscent of that earlier PR disaster, it was with unsurprising alacrity Liberal MPs and conservative media spruikers leapt into their attempts to discredit her. Liberal senator James McGrath chose to scold her as “childish” and dared her to hand back her honours. Peter van Onselen decided she was “ungracious and rude”. Sorry, boys. Live by the photo op, die by the photo op. And Grace Tame owes Scott Morrison nothing. This was the Scott Morrison who told the march of sexual violence survivors and their allies who Tame accompanied to Parliament House that the women were lucky to have not been “met with bullets”. The Scott Morrison who ignored key recommendations in the Respect@Work report, the Morrison who did not demote the minister who called alleged rape victim Brittany Higgins “a lying cow”. This is the Scott Morrison who elevated to assistant minister for women one Amanda Stoker – after Stoker had promoted men’s rights activist Bettina Arndt, who herself had platformed the man who raped Tame as a child. The Scott Morrison who responded to Tame’s speech at last year’s Australia Day awards ceremony with the remark, “Well, gee, I bet it felt good to get that out.” Morrison, a world leader and adult man, who infamously had to have it explained to him by his wife why sexual violence was bad. Yet the prime minister’s talent for image manipulation, media management and blame shifting has repeatedly saved his political skin. One suspects a thousand monkeys on a thousand typewriters in the backrooms of the prime minister’s office are already drafting the copy for the PM to place the blame for Tuesday’s Grace Tame incident on the Victorian Labor premier, Daniel Andrews. Truly, it may have worked a week ago. But a week ago Morrison had not yet suggested that children should drive forklifts. That announcement so profoundly revealed his disconnection from the electorate that, like teeth ripping into a raw onion skin, the excuses and obfuscations layered over his failures have been suddenly ripped away. It is a rule of human behaviour that to gain advantage over an opponent you evaluate how the source of their strength may be exploited as a weakness. And it is a truth universally acknowledged that leaders who coat themselves with Teflon can rarely keep a firm grasp on any details. Nothing in Morrison’s political behaviour or public comments would suggest he has been paying the kind of attention to Tame’s work that he really should. As an advocate and champion for the survivors of sexual violence, Grace Tame has spent a long year explaining how power works, from the perspective of someone who learned so cruelly and unfairly – and so young – what it is like to have absolutely none. On Tuesday, Grace Tame demonstrated in a single photo shoot an understanding of power that goes deeper than even a sitting prime minister’s. What a warrior.

1/26/2022,"Gains from a UK trade deal with India could be on a par with those from an agreement with the US but risks exposing the economy to tougher competition, a report says. The Resolution Foundation thinktank said successful talks between London and New Delhi had the potential to gain “first-mover” advantage in India and replicate the success of German manufacturing exporters to China.  But the report noted there was a risk of Britain’s business services firms – one of the economy’s strongest sectors – being undercut by lower-cost Indian rivals in a repeat of the hollowing out of US manufacturing by Chinese competition. India has traditionally been one of the toughest markets to break into, but is forecast to become the world’s biggest importer by 2050. Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the international trade secretary, opened talks with India’s minister of commerce and industry, Piyush Goyal, earlier this month. The move is part of a pivot towards trade with Asia following Britain’s departure from the EU and slow progress in talks with Washington. The UK is seeking to become a member of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) – an 11-nation group that includes Japan, Chile, Australia, Canada and Singapore. Sophie Hale, principal economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “While much of the focus has concentrated on becoming the first European country to join the huge CPTPP region, the far bigger potential economic gains and risks lie in more trade with the huge, rapidly growing, but still relatively closed Indian economy. “Trade liberalisation with India is expected to boost UK manufacturing in the short term, but could also benefit business services, where UK firms already enjoy a competitive advantage, and where demand is set to soar.” Hale’s report said UK firms exporting to India currently face far higher tariffs (19%, on average) than they do to the US (2%), providing far more scope for trade liberalisation. Securing a free trade agreement with India could also give UK firms a first-mover competitive advantage over exporting firms in the US and EU, which don’t have preferential access to the Indian economy. India is forecast to become the world’s third-largest import market by 2050, while its demand for business, telecommunications and computer services – sectors where UK export firms already perform well – is expected to treble over the course of the 2020s. “But India is changing as well as growing, so any trade deal means accepting uncertainty about the competition that will face UK firms, as the price for access to a fast-expanding market,” Hale said. The report noted India had a comparative advantage in the export of business services – especially the high-end business services sector clustered in London and the south-east.",News/Business,UK could gain ‘first-mover’ advantage with India trade deal,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/26/uk-could-gain-first-mover-advantage-with-india-trade-deal
1/26/2022,"The UK advertising watchdog has banned a high-profile marketing campaign by Swedish alt-milk brand Oatly after ruling its green claims were misleading. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) launched an investigation into the campaign after receiving 109 complaints from members of the public and the campaign group A Greener World.  In one national newspaper ad the company, which attracted investment from Blackstone, Oprah Winfrey and Jay-Z last year ahead of floating on the US stock market in May, claimed “climate experts say cutting dairy and meat products from our diets is the single biggest lifestyle change we can make to reduce our environmental impact”. The ASA said consumers would understand the claim to be a “definitive, objective claim that was based on scientific consensus,” when instead it was the opinion of one climate expert. Oatly maintained that following a vegan diet would reduce a person’s environmental impact more than cutting down their flights, buying an electric car, or purchasing sustainable meat and dairy. In paid-for ads on Twitter and Facebook, Oatly claimed the “dairy and meat industries emit more CO2 than all the world’s planes, trains, cars, boats etc, combined”. However, when the ASA investigated the claim it found Oatley had “overstated” the emissions of the meat and dairy industry because the company did not take into account emissions covering the full life cycle of transport, only emissions when a vehicle is driven. Oatly said it had no plans to repeat the claim and removed posts making similar claims from its own social media channels. Furthermore, two TV ads, which featured children questioning their dads’ decision to drink cow’s milk, claimed that Oatly “generates 73% less CO2e v milk, calculated from grower to grocer”. The ASA said it expected to see the blanket claim based on evidence comparing all Oatly products and types of cow’s milk. However, it was based on a single product. “We concluded that because the evidence was not sufficient to support the claim as consumers would understand it, the ads were misleading,” said the ASA. Oatly spokesman, Tim Knight, said: “It’s clear that we could have been more specific in the way we described some of the scientific data. “We’re a science-based company and take pride in being precise, but we could have been clearer. We talk about these things a lot, because we want to make it easy for people to make an informed switch from dairy to oat drink.” Oatly is the latest big brand to be called out by the ASA after a pledge the watchdog made last September to crackdown on unsubstantiated or misleading green claims being made by firms. Last week, the watchdog banned ads run by Lipton, which is owned by drinks giant Pepsi, over misleading claims that all parts of its bottles are made from 100% recycled plastic.",News/Media,Oatly ads banned by UK watchdog over ‘misleading’ green claims,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/26/oatly-ads-banned-by-uk-watchdog-over-misleading-green-claims
1/26/2022,"Users of self-driving cars should have immunity from a wide range of motoring offences, including dangerous driving, speeding and jumping red lights, Britain’s law commissions have jointly recommended. The Law Commission for England and Wales and the Scottish Law Commission propose creation of an Automated Vehicles Act to reflect the “profound legal consequences” of self-driving cars. The person in the driving seat would no longer responsible for how the car drives; instead, the company or body that obtained authorisation for the self-driving vehicle would face regulatory sanctions if anything went wrong.  In a summary of the report, published on Wednesday, the commissions say: “While a vehicle is driving itself, we do not think that a human should be required to respond to events in the absence of a transition demand (a requirement for the driver to take control). It is unrealistic to expect someone who is not paying attention to the road to deal with (for example) a tyre blow-out or a closed road sign. Even hearing ambulance sirens will be difficult for those with a hearing impairment or listening to loud music.” The report says that there should be a clear distinction between driver support and self-driving and that a vehicle should only be classified as the latter if it is safe even when an individual is not monitoring the driving environment, the vehicle or the way that it drives. The commissions say it should be permissible for an autonomous car to create a transition demand for the driver to take control if it confronts an issue it cannot deal with but it must make the demand in a clear fashion, give the individual sufficient time to respond and be able to mitigate the risk if a human fails to take over, by at least coming to a stop. In the US, Tesla’s self-driving technology, sold under the brand names Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, have been involved in multiple crashes, including several fatalities, when neither the system nor the driver intervened. The US Department of Vehicles is reviewing Tesla’s use of the term “full self-driving”. In Britain, the commissions recommend new safeguards to stop driver assistance features from being marketed as self-driving. Public law commissioner Nicholas Paines QC said the recommendations presented “an unprecedented opportunity to promote public acceptance of automated vehicles”. Transport minister Trudy Harrison said: “The development of self-driving vehicles in the UK has the potential to revolutionise travel, making every day journeys safer, easier and greener. “This government has been encouraging development and deployment of these technologies to understand their benefits. However, we must ensure we have the right regulations in place, based upon safety and accountability, in order to build public confidence. That’s why the department funded this independent report.” Under the recommendations, which will now be considered by the respective governments, the user-in-charge of a self-driving vehicle would still retain responsibilities such as such as carrying insurance and ensuring that children wear seatbelts. Where vehicles are authorised to drive themselves without anyone in the driver seat, a licensed operator would be responsible for overseeing the journey.",News/Technology,Self-driving car users should have immunity from offences – report,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/26/self-driving-car-users-should-have-immunity-from-offences-report
1/26/2022,"For Roy Hodgson, the “easy thing would have been to disappear off into retirement”. So said Dan Ashworth in February 2019, as he reflected on Hodgson’s failed tenure as the England manager, and the view of the Football Association’s former technical director would have found broad agreement. Only not with Hodgson.  What happened with England remains the biggest stick with which to beat the 74-year-old, even if the Liverpool support might beg to differ. The quarter-final showing at Euro 2012, after Hodgson had been parachuted in at the last minute, was creditable but then came the group stage exit at the 2014 World Cup. And then came Iceland at Euro 2016. Hodgson is not the sort of man for whom the easy option appeals. And nor is he the type to embrace retirement – even at this stage of his life. It was why he jumped at the challenge to get back in at Crystal Palace in September 2017, despite the club he supported as a boy being in disarray – with no points and no goals from the opening four matches of the Premier League season. It was why, when he departed at the end of last season, head held high after giving Palace the top-flight comfort they had craved for years, he refused to rule out another comeback. And it is why we are where we are, with Hodgson having signed at Watford, eager to throw himself into another highly daunting assignment. The work has already begun 👊 pic.twitter.com/3fVW84Muay Hodgson is already the oldest person to have managed in the Premier League; he broke Sir Bobby Robson’s record when he led Palace to a 4-1 win over Leicester at the age of 71 years and 198 days. He has been out of the game for the past eight months. But those who ask why he still needs it, why he ought not simply to walk away from the remorseless mental and physical pressures, clearly do not know him. “It is a sadistic pleasure,” Hodgson told the Guardian in January 2018. “The suffering never stops – that’s the problem … if anything, it gets worse. Getting that first foot on the rung of the ladder, that’s where you find it easier to shrug off those times when your foot slips off and you have to get yourself going again. When you have been lucky enough to move up, all you see is the slide back down. You don’t see the further steps upwards. “You learn to harden yourself towards it but, the longer you are in, it isn’t something you can give up lightly. Even if you’re not winning, it is possible to derive some satisfaction from the fact you are working properly.” Watford have not won since 20 November and the manner of last Friday’s 3-0 defeat at home to lowly Norwich – the club’s seventh loss in eight league matches, the other was drawn – made the dismissal of Claudio Ranieri feel inevitable. The team looked bankrupt on every level and Hodgson will need to hit the training ground running before his first game on Saturday week – the trip to Burnley, the only club below Watford in the table. Still, few managers are hired in good times and Hodgson has been in similar situations before, particularly in the Premier League. At Fulham in December 2007 and West Brom in February 2011, he took over teams at low ebbs and in serious danger of relegation only to steer them to safety. And he would do the same at Palace. Forget Big Ron or Big Sam. It is Big Roy that a struggling club needs. At Fulham, Hodgson drove them to seventh and 12th in the following two seasons, reaching the Europa League final in the second; at West Brom, it was 10th in his one full campaign and at Palace, it was 11th, 12th, 14th and 14th. Hodgson likes to put down firm foundations and build on them but, if he has to look no further than the end of the season at Watford, then fine by him. It is all about instilling solidity and quickly, providing the platform for a little flexibility in the final third, and Hodgson has been doing this since his first managerial role at Halmstad in Sweden, in 1976. Back then, Hodgson inherited a team who had avoided relegation on goal difference the previous season and were widely tipped to go down. He changed to a back four, encouraged his players to push up, pressure the ball and also transition quickly, using long passes in behind the opposition defence. Halmstad won the league straight away. If ever a team needed tightening up, it is Watford; their defence is regularly referred to as being of Championship level. But Hodgson will get them organised in meticulous fashion, running the same session over and over, drumming home his principles of shape, structure and pattern of play. It can be monotonous for the players, even boring, and Hodgson’s teams have not always been an easy watch, which is probably why it did not work out for him during that unhappy six-month spell at Liverpool in 2010-11. Or with England. But there is a method to it and Watford are sorely in need of something. Hodgson consistently said that as long as he retained his energy and enthusiasm, he would carry on. As he prepares for his 22nd job as a manager, there is no sign of it fading.",Sport/Football,‘Big Roy’ fits the bill to give struggling Watford a chance of surviving,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/26/big-roy-fits-the-bill-to-give-struggling-watford-a-chance-of-surviving

Northern Ireland minister Conor Burns, a long-standing ally of the prime minister, told Channel 4 News on Tuesday evening that the gathering was not a “premeditated” party and that Johnson was working in the room before staff came in and presented him with a birthday cake.  “It was not a premeditated, organised party,” he said. “He was, in a sense, ambushed with a cake.” ""He was ambushed with a cake.""A Conservative MP says that a birthday celebration held in Downing Street for Boris Johnson wasn't a ""premeditated party"".Conor Burns tells @cathynewman that he supports Boris Johnson and that ""the public will ultimately judge"". pic.twitter.com/EGy0lcxXLA The MP for Bournemouth West added: “They came to his office with a cake, they sang happy birthday, he was there for 10 minutes – I don’t think most people looking at that at home would characterise that as a party.” Social media erupted with mockery at Burns’ remarks. Nigella Lawson tweeted that the term “ambushed by cake” would make the perfect title for a recipe book.

1/26/2022,"Death rates from ovarian cancer in the UK are predicted to have fallen by 17% in 2022 compared with five years ago, according to research. Researchers said the trend was mainly due to the use of oral contraceptives, a factor that also explains the difference between the UK and European Union countries, which are projected to record a drop in death rates of 7% this year. The findings were published in the journal Annals of Oncology.  “The earlier and greater use of oral contraceptives in the UK than in most EU countries for generations of women born since the 1930s has a major role in these trends,” said the lead author, Prof Carlo La Vecchia, of the University of Milan. “In Italy, Spain, Poland etc, oral contraceptives were made available considerably later, and hence the favourable trends in these countries started later and are smaller.” The research predicts 4,000 women will die from ovarian cancer in the UK in 2022. The death rate is projected to be 4.57 women per 100,000. In the 1970s, the UK had the highest death rate in Europe at nearly nine per 100,000, the researchers said, but the rate has declined ever since. “Long-term use of oral contraceptives reduces the risk of ovarian cancer by 40% in middle-aged and elderly women,” said La Vecchia. “Other factors may also be partially responsible, such as a reduced use of hormone replacement therapy.” Improvements in diagnosis and treatment may also be contributing, he added. “However, these factors are minor compared to the long-term protective effect of oral contraceptives,” he said. “We expect these favourable trends in ovarian cancer deaths to continue.” Annwen Jones, the chief executive of the charity Target Ovarian Cancer, said: “We can be cautiously optimistic about this news, which shows the protective effects of hormonal contraception against ovarian cancer. These effects are thought to occur because they limit the number of ovulations in a lifetime, which may lower the risk of cancer developing. “However, whereas ovarian cancer death rates are falling in the UK, our survival rates still lag behind, and numbers diagnosed are set to increase because of an ageing population. Eleven women still die every day in the UK and we urgently need to find better ways to detect the disease earlier and develop new treatments.” More widely, the new research predicts that death rates from the 10 most common cancers will continue to fall in the UK in 2022, although the overall numbers dying will go up because of the ageing population. There will be 176,800 deaths from cancer in the UK in 2022, the research says. This corresponds to a fall of 7% (113.2 per 100,000) in men and 6% (87.6 per 100,000) in women in the UK since 2017. The researchers warned that their predictions should be interpreted with caution and could yet be affected by the pandemic this year.",News/Society,"UK ovarian cancer death rate down 17% since 2017, study suggests",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/26/uk-ovarian-cancer-death-rate-down-17-since-2017-study-suggests
1/26/2022,"Australians could be warming to the idea of changing the date of Australia Day to recognise Indigenous peoples, or keeping 26 January but establishing a separate day for that purpose, according to the Guardian Essential poll. The latest survey of 1,028 voters finds 57% of respondents would either support changing the day or keeping the traditional date with another day to better acknowledge and respect the continuous occupation of First Nations people – which is a four-point shift from attitudes in 2021.  Australia Day is controversial because 26 January marks the day the first fleet arrived in Sydney cove in 1788 – beginning the process of Indigenous dispossession. As well as evolving community attitudes about the date, the latest Guardian Essential poll suggests a shift in mindset about the current lived reality for Indigenous Australians. The data shows fewer people think conditions have improved for Indigenous Australians during the past 10 years. In 2021, 48% of respondents said they believed things were better, but in 2022, this is down to 36%. Asked how they would be marking Australia Day, 50% of respondents said they felt the national day was just another public holiday (down from 53% who expressed that view last year), while 27% said they would be holding a celebration to mark the occasion (down from 29% in 2021). A minority of respondents (7%) said they would be working on 26 January. In the run-up to the national holiday, the Morrison government confirmed the Aboriginal flag can now be reproduced on apparel and merchandise after it secured copyright – resolving a complicated legal dispute over the use of the emblem. The government paid more than $20m to obtain the copyright to the flag and terminated commercial licenses owned by companies which had limited the reproduction of the symbol. On the eve of the Australia Day holiday, the Labor leader Anthony Albanese told the National Press Club Australia could not look to the future without also reflecting on the past, “including injustice to First Nations people”. “Until a nation acknowledges the full truth of its history, it will be burdened by its unspoken weight,” Albanese said. “We must acknowledge the wrongs, learn from them, and look for ways of healing”. Albanese said Australia needed to keep “heading down the path to become a country deeply proud of being home to the oldest continuous cultures on Earth – a nation that takes up the Uluru Statement from the Heart and its gracious, patient, call for Voice, Treaty and Truth”.",News/Australia news,Guardian Essential poll reveals growing support for changing the date of Australia Day ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/26/guardian-essential-poll-reveals-growing-support-for-changing-the-date-of-australia-day
1/26/2022,"Almost 300,000 people in the UK have aortic valve stenosis, a potentially deadly heart condition, according to the first major study to estimate its prevalence. The NHS would struggle to cope with the sheer number of people needing treatment for this over the next few years, with the number set to rise further, the researchers warned.  More than half of those with advanced forms of the disease were likely to die within five years if they did not have timely, proactive treatment, they added. Their findings were published in the specialist BMJ journal Open Heart. Aortic stenosis happens when the aortic valve, the main outflow valve of the heart, stiffens and narrows. This means it can no longer open fully, reducing or blocking blood flow from the heart into the aorta and to the rest of the body. In a significant proportion of people, the condition remains “silent”, with symptoms appearing only when it is already at an advanced stage. Given the ageing of the UK population, it is thought that there may be a large pool of as yet undiagnosed people who might benefit from life-saving treatment. The study involved researchers from NHS England, the University of Glasgow, the University of Southampton and the University of Notre Dame Australia, as well as cardiologists and surgeons in Manchester, Sheffield and Edinburgh. “To our knowledge, this is the first study to specifically estimate the treatable burden of disease associated with severe, symptomatic AS [aortic stenosis] within the UK population,” the authors wrote. “Largely driven by an ageing postwar population cohort, we estimate that close to 300,000 adults are currently living with this potentially deadly condition at any one time. Critically, such an indicative burden is far greater than the current capacity within the NHS to screen, detect, triage and treat such cases.” The researchers estimated that the overall prevalence of aortic stenosis among the over-55s in the UK in 2019 was almost 1.5%, equal to just under 300,000 people living with the potentially deadly condition at any one time. Of the total numbers with aortic stenosis, 199,000 (68%) had severe disease in 2019, according to the study. However, the 92,000 with asymptomatic disease, representing almost a third of all cases (32%), would probably not be diagnosed unless they were being proactively screened for aortic stenosis or undergoing tests for another heart problem, the researchers suggested. If someone has aortic valve disease, they may not experience any symptoms at first, according to the NHS, but the condition can eventually become more severe and cause chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting. In particularly serious cases, the condition can lead to life-threatening problems such as heart failure. If the symptoms become more severe, patients often need surgery to replace the valve. Without treatment, severe aortic valve disease is likely to get worse and may eventually be fatal. The researchers acknowledged that they had no way of verifying their estimates, advising that population data on the incidence and prevalence of aortic stenosis in the UK was inadequate and therefore their findings should be interpreted cautiously. “In conclusion, this study suggests that severe AS [aortic stenosis] is a common condition affecting many individuals within the UK population aged over 55 years,” they wrote. “Without appropriate detection and intervention, their survival prospects are likely to be poor.”",News/Society,"About 300,000 in UK have potentially deadly aortic valve condition, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/25/heart-disease-aortic-valve-stenosis-uk-prevalence-study
