1/20/2022,"CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) — The widow and two sisters of a U.S. Marine killed in Afghanistan are suing Alec Baldwin, alleging the actor exposed them to a flood of social media hatred by claiming on Instagram that one sister was an “insurrectionist” for attending former President Donald Trump's Washington, D.C., rally on Jan. 6 last year. The sister, Roice McCollum, protested peacefully and legally; was not among those who stormed the U.S. Capitol that day and, after being interviewed by the FBI, “was never detained, arrested, accused of or charged with any crime,” according to the lawsuit filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Cheyenne. The lawsuit comes as Baldwin is immersed in an ongoing investigation into the death of a cinematographer and the wounding of a director last fall after a prop gun the actor was holding on a movie set went off. Last year, Baldwin sent McCollum a $5,000 check to help the widow of her brother Marine Lance Cpl. Rylee McCollum of Jackson, who was among 13 U.S. soldiers killed in a suicide bombing Aug. 26 at the Kabul airport, according to the lawsuit. On Jan. 3 of this year, the lawsuit says, the actor privately messaged Roice McCollum on Instagram soon after she posted an almost year-old photo of the Trump rally, asking if she was the same woman who'd taken his donation. The suit says McCollum confirmed she was at the protest and told Baldwin, “Protesting is perfectly legal."" The suit says Baldwin responded by remarking that “her activities resulted in the unlawful destruction of government property, the death of a law enforcement officer, an assault on the certification of the presidential election,” and told McCollum that he'd reposted the photo to his 2.4 million Instagram followers. “Good luck,” Baldwin wrote, according to the lawsuit. “Baldwin plainly ignored Roice's denial of rioting and the assertion that she was cleared by the FBI for participating in any of the conduct Baldwin chose to falsely attribute to her via his massive following,” the lawsuit reads. Representatives for Baldwin didn’t immediately return email and phone messages Wednesday. FBI officials in Denver didn’t return email messages Wednesday asking if the lawsuit's assertions about Roice McCollum are true. Federal court records reviewed by The Associated Press did not show any criminal charges against her. After Baldwin shared the photo of the Jan. 6 protest on social media, Roice McCollum got “hundreds upon hundreds of hateful messages,"" including one telling her to “get raped and die” and that her brother “got what he deserved,” according to the lawsuit. In a post under his Instagram account, #alecbaldwininsta, Baldwin called that message “abhorrent,” and told Roice McCollum, “There are hateful things posted toward you that are wrong,” according to computer screenshots filed in the case. The lawsuit says Baldwin didn't do anything to remedy the situation, however. And by sharing the photo, he “lit the match and blew on the fire,” resulting in the hateful messages and death threats not only against Roice McCollum but also against Rylee McCollum's other sister, Cheyenne McCollum, and widow, Jiennah McCollum, it says. The lawsuit,  first reported by the Casper Star-Tribune, alleges invasion of privacy, defamation, negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress and seeks $25 million in damages. Jiennah McCollum gave birth to her late husband's daughter in September. Online fundraisers have raised around $1 million for the widow and child. On Friday, Baldwin surrendered his cellphone to authorities investigating a fatal shooting on a film set in New Mexico last fall. Baldwin’s prop revolver discharged a live round during a rehearsal, killing cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza, according to authorities. ___ Associated Press writer Jake Coyle in New York contributed to this report.",U.S./Associated Press,Alec Baldwin sued for defamation by family of slain Marine,https://news.yahoo.com/alec-baldwin-sued-defamation-family-230923110.html
1/20/2022,"Dutch Faro was hiking near Pyramid Lake north of Los Angeles recently when he caught movement in his peripheral vision, prompting him to turn around. When he did, he came face-to-face with a charging mountain lion. “When I turned around and really got a look at it, I could tell it was a … cougar,” Faro told the Sacramento Bee. With seconds to react, Faro yelled “hey” and then acted on “primal instinct.” “I went back thousands of years and just let out a caveman roar,” he told the Bee. “I’m glad it worked; I could have been in the hospital right now.” At first, he thought it might be a dog running off leash but reality set in quickly. Once he stood his ground and roared, the cougar hurried for cover. Faro told NBC Los Angeles he believes it was a mountain lion cub and he worried the mother was nearby. “People are asking me, ‘did your life flash before your eyes?’” Faro told the Bee. “I didn’t have time for my life to flash before my eyes — I had to think on my feet.” And think fast. He did the right thing in stopping and standing his round. Also on FTW Outdoors: Spearfisherman comes face-to-face with a great white shark (video) The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has several tips to help keep you safe in lion country, among them are: Do not hike, bike, or jog alone. Stay alert on trails. Avoid hiking or jogging when mountain lions are most active – dawn, dusk, and at night. Keep a close watch on small children. Off leash dogs on trails are at increased risk of becoming prey for a mountain lion. Never approach a mountain lion. Give them an escape route. DO NOT RUN. Stay calm. Running may trigger chase, catch and kill response. Do not turn your back. Face the animal, make noise and try to look bigger by waving your arms, or opening your jacket if wearing one; throw rocks or other objects. Pick up small children. Do not crouch down or bend over. Squatting puts you in a vulnerable position of appearing much like a 4-legged prey animal. Be vocal; however, speak calmly and do not use high pitched tones or high pitch screams. If a lion attacks, fight back. Research on mountain lion attacks suggests that many potential victims have fought back successfully with rocks, sticks, garden tools, even an ink pen or bare hands. Try to stay on your feet. If knocked down, try to protect head and neck.",U.S./FTW Outdoors,"Watch: Hiker turns around, sees charging cougar, has seconds to react",https://news.yahoo.com/watch-hiker-turns-around-sees-204954531.html
1/20/2022,"As Tamika Felder puts it, ""There’s never a good time to get cervical cancer."" But it happened at what felt like the worst time: She was 25 years old and had landed her dream job, working as a television producer in Washington, D.C., her whole life and all of its possibilities stretched out before her. Before her diagnosis, Felder remembers her mom telling her to get screened for cervical cancer before she aged out of her mother’s health insurance plan. But, Felder tells Yahoo Life, ""at 25, I honestly didn’t care. You’re thinking, 'I'm 25, what’s going to happen to me?' My view now is totally different."" But that wasn’t the only reason Felder put off heading to her physician for a checkup. Felder shares that she was body-shamed by her physician while in her early 20s. ""I’m not a small woman, and I was all for body positivity before body positivity was a thing,"" she shares. But during the exam, her doctor started ""poking and pushing on my abdomen and said, 'You know if you were pregnant you wouldn’t know,'"" she recalls. ""I felt so defeated and ashamed. You can tell me that I need to take care of myself and lose weight — this is not the way to do it."" Felder adds: ""It was traumatizing."" She quickly changed back into her clothes and left her doctor’s office. ""I was out the door and that was the last time I had my feet up in stirrups,"" she says. A trip to the emergency room for a boil under her arm changed that. While filling out health forms, Felder struggled to recall when her last physical and Pap test were. An ER doctor suggested that Felder get up-to-date on her screenings and recommended a health care practitioner. ""He encouraged me to schedule it immediately, especially since I had started a new job with health insurance,"" she says. That long overdue routine Pap smear revealed that Felder had cervical cancer. ""It was April 2001,"" recalls Felder, who is now 46 years old. ""I’m in this office and [the doctor] starts going over this and that, and I remember my mind trailing off. And then I heard that word. I heard her say a word that grabbed my attention. It’s like the Charlie Brown cartoon with the teacher you never see, that whamp whamp. She was saying 'carcinoma this' and you have to see a specialist.” When Felder realized she had cancer, ""I would tell you, the bottom dropped out,"" she says. ""The bottom completely dropped."" At that moment, Felder thought, ""'I'm going to die,'"" she shares. ""And I haven't truly been in love. I haven't had my heart broken. I haven’t traveled the world. I haven’t had pasta in Italy. I haven’t been to Africa on safari. I was a scared 25-year-old girl who was just starting her life and the bottom fell out because of cervical cancer."" Felder says that ""when you're diagnosed with cancer, you're thrust into this world"" of medical care. She immediately started getting second opinions from other doctors. ""I got so many second opinions because I wanted one doctor to tell me it’s all been a mistake,"" she says. “But they all said in order to survive I needed to have a radical hysterectomy immediately."" Like Felder, Tracy Jimenez had put off getting screened for cervical cancer but for a different reason: She didn’t have health insurance. However, ""I did keep going to the emergency room because of really bad back pain I was having,"" Jimenez, who was 46 years old at the time, tells Yahoo Life. ""They told me I had sciatica in my back … They didn't check me to see if I had anything below so I had no idea what was going on."" After putting up with back pain for about three years, Jimenez started experiencing pain in the back of her legs, along with fatigue, hair loss, vaginal bleeding and pain during sex. ""One night I went to the bathroom and something fleshy came out and it was not a blood clot,"" she recalls. ""I was so scared I didn't know what to do."" Jimenez went to the emergency room where a CAT scan revealed a mass. The next day, she saw a doctor who performed a gynecological exam. ""Her first words out of her mouth were, 'I'm sorry Miss Jimenez, but you have cervical cancer,"" Jimenez recalls. ""I did not know what she was talking about, and I didn't know what cervical cancer was."" Like Felder, Jimenez says the first thought in her mind was, ""'I didn't want to die.'"" Jimenez, who is now 51, says she felt scared and devastated after her cancer diagnosis. ""I left her office in tears,"" she says. ""I sat in my car and cried."" However, when Jimenez was diagnosed, she didn’t know what HPV was. ""I had never heard of HPV my whole life, and I knew very little about what cervical cancer was,"" she says. ""I was one of those people who thought that it could never happen to me. So I never really looked into what cervical cancer was because I never thought I would get cervical cancer or cancer in general."" Cervical cancer is caused by HPV (human papillomavirus), which is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ""Some people have called it the common cold of the genital tract,"" Dr. Debbie Saslow, managing director of HPV & GYN Cancer at the American Cancer Society, tells Yahoo Life. Saslow adds: ""Just about everybody who has ever had sex has had HPV. It’s unfortunate in this country there is stigma often attached to sex and how many partners you have had, particularly for women. [But] most cervical cancer cases caused by HPV are in women who have had only one partner. Yes, the risk does increase with more partners, but many have had only one partner."" There are more than 100 types of HPV and at least 14 of them are cancer-causing, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). However, two HPV types (16 and 18) in particular are responsible for 70 percent of cervical cancers and pre-cancerous cervical lesions, according to WHO. In the majority of cases, HPV goes away on its own. But when it doesn’t, the virus can cause health issues, including cancer and genital warts, depending on the HPV type. Even if you are infected with HPV, you likely wouldn’t know it. According to the CDC: ""Most people with HPV do not know they have the infection. They never develop symptoms or health problems from it."" The telltale signs of cervical cancer — such as pain during intercourse and abnormal bleeding — are more common in advanced cancer cases and ""in people who just haven’t been screened or haven’t been screened in a really long time or had an abnormal result and didn't follow up,"" says Saslow. However, if detected early, cervical cancer is one of the most successfully treatable cancers, according to ACS. First and foremost, get screened. Updated guidelines from both the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) now recommend that, starting at age 25 and through age 65, women (as well as transgender individuals with a cervix) should get the HPV test every 5 years. The HPV test, which differs from the Pap smear, checks for the virus itself to see if cells in the cervix are infected with the high-risk types of HPV. The Pap smear, on the other hand, looks for abnormal changes to cervical cells caused by HPV ""that may — if left untreated — turn into cervical cancer,"" according to the NCI. “It can also detect cervical cancer cells.” The HPV/Pap co-test combines both screening methods. The preferred screening method by both organizations is the HPV test every 5 years, while ""acceptable"" tests include the HPV/Pap co-test every 5 years or the Pap test alone every 3 years. ""Evidence shows the HPV test is more accurate than the Pap test and can be done less often; one HPV test every five years is more effective than a Pap test every three years,"" according to ACS. Along with screenings, Saslow encourages parents to get both their daughters and sons the HPV vaccine, which significantly lowers the risk of HPV-related cancers — including, notes the CDC, not only cervical cancer but also cancers of the mouth/throat and penis. In fact, the vaccine reduces the risk of cervical cancer by nearly 90 percent, according to Saslow. ""The best time to get the vaccine is between ages 9 and 12,"" says Saslow. ""If you have a kid that’s older than 12 and they didn’t have it yet, they should still get it until age 26."" The HPV vaccine requires two doses spaced six to 12 months apart. Both Felder, who had a radical hysterectomy and radiation, and Jimenez, who went through multiple rounds of radiation and chemotherapy, hope that sharing their stories will motivate women to get screened for cervical cancer and to not put off those doctor appointments. They also encourage parents to get the HPV vaccine for their children, regardless of their gender. ""I want to raise awareness because it is very necessary and not enough people know about cervical cancer or any cancer that can happen from HPV,"" says Jimenez. Felder also urges women not to ignore the signs — even subtle ones — that something might be affecting their health. ""Now that I know more about the disease, there were times I had bleeding during or after sex,"" shares Felder, who also experienced lower leg pain. ""Nothing that made me feel too alarmed. You think, 'Oh, I have bad menstrual cramps.' Now my message is, 'Your body whispers.' You have to listen and even when it doesn’t whisper you have to be proactive with your health."" Above all, Felder says: ""I want people to know that you can die of cervical cancer. And if you’re lucky enough to survive, it breaks you; it bends you. It’s with you forever. It doesn't leave you."" She adds: ""I want people to put their feet up in stirrups. I want doctors not to shame people in general because it hinders them from getting screened. I want people to vaccinate their children… I believe we could have a world without cervical cancer. And you can’t say that about any other cancer."" Felder, who founded the nonprofit organization Cervivor, which supports cervical cancer survivors, says her life is more fulfilling now — adding that her legacy ""will be the lives I've saved."" But she doesn’t sugarcoat what she’s been through — ""cancer has truly taken so much from me,"" Felder says — and stops short of calling cancer ""a gift."" ""I have a beautiful, wonderful life,"" Felder says. ""But there’s a part of me that always wonders, without cancer, what would it look like? We’re supposed to be grateful — and I am — but I wonder, what would that life look like? I know I’m lucky because I think about Laura who died in her 20s. I think about Erica who did in her 30s. I think about Lisa who died before she was 30. They ran out of time. They all ran out of time. And it could have easily been me."" January is Cervical Cancer Awareness Month and a Colorado oncologist says now is the perfect time to remind the women in your life to get their annual checkup.

1/20/2022,"By Lawrence Hurley WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected former President Donald Trump's request to block the release of White House records sought by the Democratic-led congressional panel investigating last year's deadly attack on the Capitol by a mob of his supporters. The decision means the documents, held by a federal agency that stores government and historical records, can be disclosed even as litigation over the matter continues in lower courts. Only one of the court's nine members, conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, publicly noted disagreement with the decision. Trump's request to the justices came after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Dec. 9 ruled https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-appeals-court-rejects-trumps-bid-withhold-records-panel-probing-jan-6-attack-2021-12-09 that the businessman-turned-politician had no basis to challenge President Joe Biden's decision to allow the records to be handed over to the House of Representatives select committee. Trump and his allies have waged an ongoing legal battle with the committee seeking to block access to documents and witnesses. Trump has sought to invoke a legal principle known as executive privilege, which protects the confidentially of some internal White House communications, a stance rejected by lower courts. The brief Supreme Court order noted that the weighty question of whether a former president can assert an executive privilege claim did not need to be answered to resolve the case. ""Because the court of appeals concluded that President Trump's claims would have failed even if he were the incumbent, his status as a former president necessarily made no difference to the court's decision,"" the unsigned order said. The House committee has said it needs the records to understand any role Trump may have played in fomenting the violence that unfolded on Jan. 6, 2021. His supporters stormed the Capitol in a failed bid to prevent Congress from formally certifying Biden's 2020 presidential election victory over Trump. The committee has asked the National Archives, which holds Trump's White House records, to produce visitor logs, phone records and written communications between his advisers. Biden, who took office two weeks after the riot, has determined that the records, which belong to the executive branch, should not be subject to executive privilege and that turning them over to Congress was in the best interests of the nation. Trump has argued that he can invoke executive privilege based on the fact he was president at the time even though he is no longer in office. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan on Nov. 9 rejected Trump's arguments, saying he had not acknowledged the ""deference owed"" to Biden's determination that the committee could access the records and adding: ""Presidents are not kings, and Plaintiff is not President."" The select committee is comprised https://january6th.house.gov/about/membership of seven Democrats and two Republicans. The Supreme Court's 6-3 conservative majority includes three justices appointed by Trump, but it has not always been receptive to his requests. The court last year rejected https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-trump-taxes/u-s-supreme-court-sets-the-stage-for-release-of-trump-tax-returns-idUSKBN2AM1MN his request to block disclosure of his tax records as part of a criminal investigation in New York and also turned away attempts by Trump and his allies to overturn https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump/u-s-supreme-court-swiftly-ends-trump-backed-texas-bid-to-upend-election-results-idUSKBN28L2YY the 2020 election. Shortly before the riot, Trump repeated to a crowd of his supporters his false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud, telling them to go to the Capitol and ""fight like hell"" to ""stop the steal."" Any delay by the Supreme Court in allowing the disclosure of the records could have imperiled the panel's chances of obtaining them. The committee aims to finish its work before the November congressional elections in which Trump's fellow Republicans are seeking to regain House control. Republicans opposed the panel's creation and could shut down the inquiry if they win a majority in the chamber.
