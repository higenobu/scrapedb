3/22/2022,"Ben Roberts-Smith punched a woman he was having an affair with in the face, refused to take her to hospital when she pleaded for medical help, and then took pictures of her naked while she slept, the woman has told the federal court. In an emotional two hours in the witness box, the woman, who has been anonymised before the court as Person 17, gave evidence about a tempestuous six-month relationship she had with the former SAS soldier, which she alleges was at times threatening and violent. She also gave evidence Roberts-Smith pressured her into terminating a pregnancy and threatened he was “not someone you’d want to get on the wrong side of”. She told the court several times she was scared to upset him because “I was afraid of what he might do”. Person 17 told the court Roberts-Smith pressured her to lie about him hitting her, instructing her to say she had sustained a black eye when she fell down the stairs. She said that as they talked about ending their affair, he threatened her: “As long as we’re on the same page, we’ve got nothing to worry about, but if you turn on me I will burn your house down. It might not be you that gets hurt, it might be people that you love and care about.” Roberts-Smith, a recipient of the Victoria Cross and one of Australia’s most decorated soldiers, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges portray him as committing war crimes, including murder, as well as acts of bullying and domestic violence. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies all wrongdoing. Person 17 has been subpoenaed to appear by the newspapers. The court has placed a non-publication order over the woman’s identity. She told the court she met Roberts-Smith at a charity event in October 2017 and they began seeing each other “every 10 days or so”. She said the pair communicated via Telegram, Roberts-Smith’s second “burner” phone, and a shared Gmail account to which they both held the logins so they could correspond without any electronic trace. Person 17 described the initial relationship as “fast-moving and all-consuming”. “He said to me he wished he met me 20 years earlier, before he met his wife. He said he didn’t want to stay in an unhappy marriage for the rest of his life.” “I said I thought I was falling in love with him.” But the court heard the relationship was riven by mistrust and confrontations. Person 17 said Roberts-Smith threatened her when he thought she was flirting with another man. She said he told her he was suffering from depression and was an alcoholic, drinking two to three bottles a night. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning At one stage, during an argument in early 2018 – before any media stories had been published linking Roberts-Smith to allegations of war crimes, but after the Brereton inquiry into war crimes allegations had begun – she said she asked him why he was stressed, and whether he was worried about work. “Work problems,” Roberts-Smith said, “we’re talking about fucking war crimes.” While on holidays in the UK in early 2018, Person 17 said she discovered she was pregnant. “I knew that the father was Ben, because I had not slept with anyone else,” Person 17 told the court. Person 17 said, after initially agreeing to terminate the pregnancy, she “started having second thoughts about it all”, but said she felt pressured by Roberts-Smith. “It’s not something I really believe in. He started to get angry with me, my indecision, my failure to do anything. He said ‘you need to do something about this now, if you don’t, you’ve only got a couple of weeks left, and then it will be too late. You’ve got to book something today and tell me where it is’. “He told me if I kept the baby, he would not stick around long-term,” Person 17 told the court. Person 17 gave evidence she told Roberts-Smith she had booked a termination at a clinic in suburban Brisbane. In his evidence last year, Roberts-Smith hired a private investigator to follow and film Person 17 at the clinic. Roberts-Smith said he did it because he didn’t believe she would terminate the pregnancy and he believed she was lying about the pregnancy to get him to stay in the relationship. Person 17 told the court she miscarried the pregnancy a few days before the appointment, but attended the clinic to maintain the pretence. She said that, when she saw Roberts-Smith in Brisbane, he forced her take a pregnancy test in front of him. She said that when that failed to register a result, he walked her down to a shopping centre to buy another test. But approaching an underpass leading to the shops, Person 17 said she was too scared to go with him. “I just remember feeling so afraid to even go in there with him.” Roberts-Smith ultimately bought the pregnancy test himself. Person 17 said that in early 2018, she and Roberts-Smith were at a function at Parliament House. She said that she and Roberts-Smith had been drinking at lunch and throughout the afternoon. Person 17 said she felt “quite drunk by the time we left”. She said Roberts-Smith was agitated when they left and walked ahead of her to the car park. She fell down “two or three steps”, hitting her head, and the side of her body. She was helped to the car by another person. “When I got to the car, I got into the backseat on the left-hand side, he [Roberts-Smith] got into the front. There was some discussion about whether I should be taken to hospital or a doctor, and I thought I should be. “The driver offered to take us to hospital emergency centre. Ben said no, to go back to hotel and he would look after me.” In emotional evidence she said Roberts-Smith was angry with her back at their hotel room, yelling in her face “what the fuck have you done”, saying she had been flirtatious with other men, and had exposed their affair. Person 17 said she just wanted to go to bed and that her head hurt. She told the court, Roberts-Smith responded by saying “It’s going to hurt more”, or “I’ll show you hurt”. “And he punched me with his right fist on the side of my face and left eye … I ended up lying on the bed. I just lay there still because I didn’t know what he was going to do next.” Person 17 told the court she was fully clothed when she fell on the bed, but when she woke up later in the night, she was naked. “I said ‘my head hurts and I want to go to the hospital’. “He said ‘no, you’ll be fine, I’ll look after you’.” She said she and Roberts-Smith had sex later in the night, “and afterwards he was holding me saying ‘it’s going to be OK’. And I was just saying I’m sorry and I loved him, and apologising.” Person 17 told the court in the morning Roberts-Smith showed her photos he had taken on his phone of her asleep naked, and asked her: “Do I need to keep these photos?” “I didn’t say anything,” Person 17 told the court. Later that morning, Person 17 said she and Roberts-Smith discussed what she would tell her husband and friends about the black eye she had sustained, with Roberts-Smith allegedly telling her the future of their relationship depended on what she said. “Do you remember what happened in the hotel room?” Roberts-Smith allegedly asked her. “No,” Person 17 said she replied. “Good girl. You hurt yourself when you fell over,” she said Roberts-Smith responded. Person 17 was asked in court, “Why did you say you couldn’t remember?” “I was afraid of what he might do if I didn’t say that.” On Tuesday afternoon, Person 17 began giving evidence about later arriving unannounced at the Roberts-Smith’s family home, and also said she lied to her doctor about the cause of the black eye, saying she drunkenly fell down the stairs. Person 17 will continue in the witness box Wednesday morning. Roberts-Smith was questioned on the alleged incident at the Canberra hotel during his testimony before the court last year. He denied all allegations of violence or threatening behaviour, saying the allegations were “completely false”. “The whole story is a fabrication,” he told the court. “I’ve never hit a woman. I never would hit a woman. And I certainly never hit Person 17.” Roberts-Smith said Person 17 sustained the injuries to her face and side when she fell down the stairs at Parliament House. He said he did not believe she needed to go to hospital, and he took her to the hotel room where he undressed her, put an icepack on her head, and put her to bed. He said he checked her respiratory rate and pulse and stayed awake all night checking she was OK. He denied ever taking naked photos of her, saying that was a “disgusting” allegation. Roberts-Smith has previously told the court he and his wife were separated at the time he and Person 17 began their affair. His now ex-wife told the court this was not true, that they were not separated, and he pressured her to lie. “I’ve never had any qualms with using the word affair,” Roberts-Smith told the court. The trial, before Justice Anthony Besanko, continues.",News/Australia news,‘I was afraid of what he might do’: woman tells court Ben Roberts-Smith punched her and threatened to burn down her house,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/22/i-was-afraid-of-what-he-might-do-woman-tells-court-ben-roberts-smith-punched-her-and-threatened-to-burn-down-her-house
3/22/2022,"Catriona WardViper, £14.99, pp352 Teacher Rob is trying to live a normal life, in suburban America, with her beloved daughters and husband, Irving. But it never quite works: Irving is boiling over with anger, and Callie, the couple’s elder child, likes to talk about murder at breakfast. She also likes to play, secretly, with small bones and talk to things that aren’t there. When something terrible nearly happens to Rob’s younger daughter, Annie, she blames Callie and decides she needs to take her away, back to her childhood home of Sundial, surrounded by miles of chain link fence, deep in the Mojave desert. Sundial is Catriona Ward’s fourth novel, following the excellent Rawblood and Little Eve, and the bestselling blend of thriller and horror that was The Last House on Needless Street. It is, again, terrifying, and shocking in its exploration of what humans will do to one another and the stains left by childhood trauma. Ward captures beauty and dread in the endless sand and heat of Rob’s former home, where “desert light falls over distant mountains, [and] the land grows dim, spread out like a dirty coyote pelt under the sky”, where “all that space gets in your head, makes your thoughts go crazy”. When Rob returns, she finds the “desert thoughts” that she had concealed with the trappings of everyday life – “spice racks and my daughters and herbaceous borders, cocktails with neighbours and PTA meetings” – start to spill out, and the person she had kept “walled… up, sealed… off in the dark” starts to emerge. Moving between perspectives, we see the world through the eyes of Callie, who talks to imaginary friends and wonders who she can trust; through the eyes of Rob, as she confronts the horrors of her past and tries to stop them playing out in the present, and through the eyes of Jack, too, Rob’s sister. “When people say something is ‘unthinkable’, what they usually mean is that they don’t want to think it. They are resistant to an idea,” says Rob. “But that is not what unthinkable means. I understand that now. It means to be confronted with a thought so vast, dark and monstrous that it will not fit into any known shapes in our mind.” As she slowly exposes evil, Ward wrongfoots the reader at every turn. What were Rob and Jack’s parents trying to do with their strange experiments? What, or who, is Callie seeing when she talks to her imaginary pals? How far will Rob go to keep her daughters safe, and where is the danger really coming from? Sundial is disturbing and yet ultimately moving as the bonds of love become clear. Inga SimpsonSphere, £14.99, pp352 Set in Australia, The Last Woman in the World takes place in the aftermath of pandemics and devastating fires. It’s a sad and broken place, and Rachel, Simpson’s protagonist, has taken refuge in the bush, trying to hold on to life. A knock at her door brings a mother and baby into her world, and she discovers that the region – the world, maybe – has been devastated by a mysterious wave of deaths. Initially creepy and chilling, this becomes a hell-for-leather survival race through burning countryside as Rachel attempts to find her sister. Ellery LloydMantle, £14.99, pp352 The Club is something very different: a super-glamorous locked-room (locked island, really) murder mystery. An ultra-exclusive members’ club is opening its most exclusive retreat yet, on a private island reached only by causeway, and celebrities are descending for the launch event. The luxury on offer is just what they were hoping for – until a body is discovered, floating in the sea outside the underwater restaurant. Glitzy and twisty, it’s tons of fun.

3/22/2022,"In many ways I agree with Dr Gavin Ashenden, the former cleric who has railed against exotically flavoured hot cross buns as “the work of the devil”. I am a huge enthusiast for the original; toasted so that the upper crumbs just begin to hint at carbonisation, slathered with butter and then briefly placed under the grill, to enable the cream and salt to permeate the crevices where the plump raisins lie. Such is my devotion to this treat that I am innately suspicious of any deviation from the traditional formula. This has been confirmed for me by a series of taste tests. I tasted savoury versions with cheese and Marmite (which came under particular fire from Dr Ashenden). These were fine but infinitely worse than, say, a slice of cheese on toast with marmite. I tried Heston Blumenthal’s mocha buns, too – another disappointment, as if someone had mixed old coffee granules with croissant dough. I have even tried Aldi’s hot cross bun liqueur. It was vile – the lovechild of Jägermeister and sweet, Christmassy sick. If supermarkets can’t even link the flavour of their product to seasonally appropriate vomit then what hope is there for a proper theological discussion? However, I have to confess that even as a cleric, my issues with these recent mutations stem only from problems with their flavour. Dr Ashenden’s gripe was with the form itself: that “Christians are sad that the symbolism is lost”. Yet when I looked at countless varieties of hot cross bun, from blueberry to cheddar to chocolate, what struck me about all of them was that they retained the cross in their design. Now, I would have thought that aspect was what provided them with their theological value – unless, of course, Dr Ashenden is claiming some special salvific significance of the humble raisin. Perhaps I might be accused of not taking the cross seriously, but quite the opposite is true. Hot cross buns were probably developed more as a marketing ploy by an enterprising baker than as an aid for teaching the faith, and so the idea that without a specific flavour we will suddenly forget the meaning of the cross is palpably absurd. Dr Ashenden is concerned that such changes represent a “loss of the narrative of struggle”. Yet I’m not sure the original buns necessarily had that in the first place – what they do represent are small reminders of Christianity, even in the sphere of the commercial. Surely that can be no bad thing. It’s difficult to know what will stir meditations on the life and death of Christ for someone, but it is foolish of Christians to try to shut down potential routes to the cross. The Damascene moment might be prompted by a piece of art or music or literature, or simply the way light streams through a window or rain flows into a gutter. It might even be the result of meditating on a strangely flavoured bun. Even if the symbolism of the bun is warped by different flavour, Christians believe that the symbolism of the cross cannot be. The Carthusian order of monks has as its motto: “the cross stands steady while the world turns.” Whether those turns are represented by the wars, horrors and tumults we see across the world every day, or whether they are represented by Asda putting red Leicester in them is, of course, a matter of opinion. Essential to Christian belief is the idea that the cross embraces all and that the cross conquers all. It is a symbol of torture and pain and death that changes into one of hope and joy. In the light of that leap of faith, the flavour of the dough it’s made from seems a secondary issue at best. The cross is a reminder of hope because, for Christians, it leads to the empty tomb, to the idea that life conquers death and that love conquers all. Whether accompanied by Marmite or cinnamon, reminders of that are always to be welcomed. Fergus Butler-Gallie is a clergyman and author",Opinion/Opinion,"Work of the devil? I think not.

3/22/2022,"This political drama from South Korea tells the amazing true story of a daring escape by North and South Korean diplomats from Somalia in the early 1990s as all hell breaks loose. It was South Korea’s entry for best international feature at the Oscars and has that highly polished, top-quality solid-weight feel (there are echoes here of Ben Affleck’s best picture winning Argo). What makes it worth the price of a download is a muscle-clenchingly thrilling third act, finishing with an action movie car chase through war-zone chaos. It’s 1991. Diplomats from North and South Korea in Mogadishu have been competing for Somalia’s vote to decide whether South Korea joins the United Nations. Attempts by South Korean ambassador Han (Kim Yoon-seok) to woo Somali dictator Mohamed Siad Barre have been repeatedly foiled by his opposite number at the North Korean embassy, wily veteran Rim (Huh Joon-ho). Then Barre is overthrown, the capital descends into anarchy, and the North Koreans come knocking at the South Koreans’ door for sanctuary. An incident as they walk through the capital’s streets confirms something I’ve heard war reporters say: that nothing is scarier than a small child with a loaded gun. There’s some unexpected humour at the South Korean embassy, like the uncomfortable silence around the dinner table as the North Koreans nervously fiddle with their chopsticks. South Korean ambassador Han clicks what’s happening and swaps plates: the North Koreans are scared of being poisoned by their enemies. This is a decent, intelligent, well-acted film if a little uninspired until that third act, which packs an almighty punch: staff from both embassies travelling in a convoy of cars through a terrifyingly believable conflict zone: guns firing, Molotov cocktails flying. It’s a shame though that there’s not more curiosity about the Somalian characters, who are to a man (and this a film about men) completely one-dimensional.  Escape from Mogadishu is released on 25 March in cinemas.",Arts/Film,Escape from Mogadishu review – Koreans bolt through Somali war-zone chaos,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/22/escape-from-mogadishu-review-koreans-bolt-through-somali-war-zone-chaos
3/22/2022,"Although Blaise Matuidi’s time in MLS with Inter Miami did not provide the desired results on the pitch, his spell in Florida has helped inspire his next step. Matuidi has had an interest in business for a number of years, investing in various tech startups, including alongside NBA star LeBron James. “When I see athletes here in the United States, I think they have something different to European athletes and the difference is that they know about business. They are experts in their own field but they are also very focused in making other things in life, especially business,” says the Frenchman. “I think in Europe our goals are in sport and we are focused on that. I think there are few players that are open-minded but a lot are focused only on the sport. I understand that, as we are born like that. In the academy, people say: ‘I have to be focused only on football’. Here in the United States, it is something different as when sportspeople go to university they go with engineers, people who work with electrics, and they are all together. In Europe when we go to academies, we are only players. I think it is a big difference and that’s when we create Origins.” Origins is planned as a tech investment fund for athletes, including Matuidi’s fellow World Cup winners N’Golo Kante and Olivier Giroud. The athletes aim to pool their financial clout and social media influence to help grow new companies. Matuidi wants to show players they can look outside of sports for opportunities and show they are more than just athletes. Inter Miami co-owner David Beckham is a prime example of a footballer who has moved into the business world. When Matuidi was looking for a new challenge, it was his former Paris Saint-Germain teammate’s new venture, Inter Miami, that came calling for his services, persuading him to leave Europe for the club’s inaugural MLS season in 2020. Matuidi was left off the team’s roster for the 2022 season, despite having a year remaining on his contract, leaving him more time to focus on his business interests. “I played with David in the past at Paris Saint-Germain, not for too long but it was a good time,” Matuidi says. “I was happy because he had had this experience and he helped Paris Saint-Germain a lot. When I heard Inter Miami was interested in signing me, David was a big part of my thinking, so I was happy to join his team because he is an example with his experience, what he did in his great career and now as an owner for me is something special. “Our relationship is good and he’s a good guy, and he wants his team to win. When he says things, he does it. I have big respect for him. He doesn’t speak to the players a lot but when he does you understand his goal and where he wants to go.” Getting Matuidi to move to the MLS at the age of 32 was a coup for Inter Miami in their infancy, especially as he could have stayed in the relative comfort of Europe. “For me it was a new challenge. In Europe I played a lot of games, I won a lot of titles [three with Juventus and four with PSG] and was thinking that I needed something new for me and my family,” he says. “I decided to move on because my family was my first thought, and then the challenge. I know MLS is not like Europe, not in terms of quality, but as in Europe there are more big clubs but for me it was something I wanted to do with this new challenge.” Inter Miami are managed by another former teammate of Beckham’s, Phil Neville. So far, his time in charge has been underwhelming: the club finished 10th and 11th in the Eastern Conference in their first two seasons, missing the playoffs on both occasions. This season has been even worse: they have lost three of their first four games, and have the worst record in the entire league. Neville’s job is under scrutiny – and Beckham may be in the awkward position of having to fire his friend – but the former England defender cannot be blamed entirely for the club’s woes. Inter Miami are in rebuilding mode after the club were fined $2m and had wage sanctions imposed after an investigation found they violated roster designation rules for Matuidi and Andres Reyes. “There are a lot of young players,” Matuidi says. “It is never easy when you are a new team, you need time and I think Inter Miami need time. It is not an easy league and you need a team with experience … If you look at Europe, a team like Manchester City before they won [the Premier League] it took time, as it did with Chelsea. When anyone plays Inter Miami, they want to beat us because we are one of the most popular teams in the league, that is why it is not easy.” In footballing terms, Matuidi’s future is uncertain. Gone are the days when Juventus paid PSG an initial €20m for his services and his ambition of moving to England is long gone. “In the past I was close to moving to the Premier League, to Arsenal, that was my dream. I played in Italy and France, and a lot of people were saying: ‘How you play, you need to move to the Premier League’. Unfortunately, I didn’t, so you never know.” Matuidi will be hoping he does not miss out on any opportunities in his other career.",Sport/Sport,Blaise Matuidi: ‘David Beckham was a big part of why I moved to MLS’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/22/blaise-matuidi-david-beckham-was-a-big-part-of-why-i-moved-to-mls
3/22/2022,"The former British foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt has called for an independent investigation into why it took six years to free Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, saying she was right to question why her release took so long to secure. Both Hunt and the former foreign minister Alistair Burt have said they would be willing to give evidence about the issues involved in securing her release. Burt has proposed there should be a foreign affairs select committee inquiry into why the payment of a historic debt was delayed. Both are understood to be anxious that the UK takes the opportunity to learn wider lessons from the negotiations – rather than allow the issues to be forgotten amid the Ukraine and cost of living crises. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a dual British-Iranian national, was held in Iran after visiting her parents with her then-22-months-old daughter, Gabriella. She was accused of plotting against the regime, linked to her work with media charities though she was not carrying out that work while in the country. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, who campaigned for six years for her release, said she was a state hostage and his wife and another prisoner, Anoosheh Ashoori, were released when the UK paid a historic £400m debt to Iran. At a press conference on Monday, Zaghari-Ratcliffe said she did not agree with her husband thanking the British government. “I mean, how many foreign secretaries does it take for someone to come home? Five? We all know … how I came home. It should have happened exactly six years ago. I should not have been in prison for six years.” In a Twitter thread on Tuesday, Hunt said: “Those criticizing Nazanin have got it so wrong. She doesn’t owe us gratitude: we owe her an explanation. “She’s absolutely right that it took too long to bring her home. I tried my best – as did other foreign secretaries – but if trying our best took six years then we must be honest and say the problem should have been solved earlier.” Hunt said it was right that “ministerial turnover may have been a factor” and said there was also “initial reluctance to pay the debt because people worried it would look like a ransom. So undoubtedly were the complications over how to pay a country that is sanctioned.” But he said it was now right that an independent investigation examined if lessons could be learned and said he would be “glad to assist”. “Such a review also needs to assess whether our current policy is sufficient to stop hostage taking in the future,” he said. “If democracies can show such impressive unity on Russian sanctions, surely we can do the same to stamp out the 19th-century practice of hostage taking? “This kind of open scrutiny as to whether we could do things better is what happens in democratic, open societies. It may be something they don’t welcome in places like Iran and Russia but it is why, ultimately, we are wiser and stronger.” Burt, a Tory MP until 2019, called for the committee to launch an inquiry into why the debt was not paid and into who – either in the governments of the UK or the US – resisted making the payment. Burt also said he repeatedly urged the government to pay the £400m, which he said was “not a ransom, but a debt owed”. Burt was Middle East minister between 2017 and 2019, and says even now he is not sure what forces were preventing the debt’s payment. It is understood that Burt at one point formed a view that the then defence secretary Gavin Williamson was opposed to the payment. Burt challenged him, leading to a row, but never received a direct response.",News/News,Zaghari-Ratcliffe: Hunt calls for inquiry into delay over Iran debt payment,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/mar/22/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-jeremy-hunt-inquiry-iran-debt-delay

While spectacular, it was not that unusual.The Sahara is the world’s biggest producer of dust, which can be blown far and wide, especially in spring when seasonal winds rake the desert. In fact, clouds of the dust can be swept across the Atlantic on the trade winds, and more than 20m tonnes reach the Amazon each year. That dust is a precious fertiliser that nourishes the rainforest with much-needed iron and phosphorus minerals. In fact, by a strange symmetry, the Saharan dust adds about the same amount of phosphorus to the Amazon each year that is flushed out to sea by flood waters.The dust also fertilises the vast numbers of microscopic phytoplankton in the Atlantic, the tiny algae that soak up huge amounts of carbon dioxide.
