4/28/2022,"One Nation has divided its support between the major parties on how-to-vote cards, directing supporters to preference Labor in at least five seats while helping the Coalition in the north Queensland seat of Leichhardt and Braddon in Tasmania. The One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, revealed the plan on Thursday, confirming retaliation against select moderate MPs for the Liberals’ decision to preference the minor party behind the Jacqui Lambie Network in Tasmania. But One Nation will benefit from Liberal-National Senate preferences in Queensland, where the major party has advised its supporters to put Hanson second. A furious Lambie rejected any suggestions her party had done a deal with the Liberals, although it is unclear how she will direct her voters in the key northern Tasmanian marginals of Bass and Braddon. Hanson confirmed she will preference against the Liberal MP Bridget Archer, who holds Bass on 0.4%, but in favour of the Liberal MP Gavin Pearce in Braddon, on 3.1%. Others on Hanson’s hit list include the Liberals Tim Wilson in Goldstein (Victoria), Trent Zimmerman in North Sydney, James Stevens in Sturt (SA) and the independent Helen Haines in Indi (Victoria), four seats in which One Nation did not field candidates at the 2019 election. Hanson told Sky News on Thursday she was “shocked and disgusted” with the Liberal party for supporting the Lambie network “without even debating and negotiating” with Lambie and also criticised the decision to preference Derryn Hinch’s Justice Party ahead of One Nation in Victoria. Hanson said she would “balance out” assistance for Labor by helping the Nationals in other seats, but failed to name any, explaining that she was “exhausted” and couldn’t remember them. “I am doing Scott Morrison’s job for him – of getting rid of left-leaning Liberals destroying the conservative party,” she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Despite reports on Wednesday suggesting One Nation could tip the scales against the Liberal MP Warren Entsch in Leichhardt, he was omitted from the list of moderates. But One Nation will also help Labor in Longman by suggesting voters put the Liberal MP, Terry Young, last. Ross Taylor, the One Nation candidate in Longman, told Guardian Australia the decision to put Labor sixth ahead of the Greens and LNP was “his call – and it’s done”. Lambie accused One Nation of “standing for nothing” and offering “insincere” support for Labor in some seats. “For all her talk about sticking up for freedom, Pauline’s spat the dummy because she wants to control what the Liberal party puts on its how-to-vote cards,” Lambie said in a statement. “Tasmanian voters decide their own preferences. Queenslanders like One Nation don’t get to decide for anybody here.” Earlier on Thursday, Morrison said preferences would be decided by “different arrangements in different states and territories” but acknowledged Hanson’s anger about Tasmania. “I know that there’s a view about what’s occurring in Tasmania, but you know what, that’s just all politics.” Morrison later told Sky News the “[Liberal] party organisation” was responsible for preferences. Other beneficiaries of Liberal Senate preferences include the Liberal Democrats and United Australia party in New South Wales, the UAP in Victoria, Bob Day in South Australia and the Australian Christians in Western Australia. Labor is committed to put One Nation last or near-last around the country. Paul Williams, a political scientist at Griffith University, said One Nation preferences were “enormously” important in Queensland as it could win up to a third of the primary vote in some regional seats, including Flynn, another Labor target. Williams said in Longman, One Nation preferences were “very significant” as it was the “lowest-hanging fruit” in Queensland, on a margin of 3.3%. But Williams warned that One Nation voters were “among the least disciplined in their preference distributions”. “It speaks to the whole ethos of One Nation to stick two fingers up to authority, to stick it up elites, they are not even going to listen to their own party … They tend to spray preferences everywhere.”",News/Australia news,One Nation directs preferences to Labor in five seats targeting ‘left-leaning Liberals’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/28/one-nation-directs-preferences-to-labor-in-five-seats-targeting-left-leaning-liberals
4/28/2022,"Liverpool’s owner, Fenway Sports Group, has opened talks about extending Jürgen Klopp’s contract beyond 2024. FSG’s president, Mike Gordon, travelled from Boston to Anfield for Wednesday’s Champions League semi-final first leg against Villarreal, where a 2-0 victory kept Liverpool on course for an unprecedented quadruple. Klopp’s agent, Marc Kosicke, was sitting a few seats away from Gordon and it is understood a contract extension for Liverpool’s figurehead manager was on their agenda. Liverpool’s owners have long hoped the 54-year-old would sign another contract with the club he has revitalised since his arrival in October 2015. They were encouraged by comments Klopp made last month, when he said he could sign a new deal at the “last minute” depending on his energy levels and enthusiasm for the job, and have moved while the manager is open to the idea. Klopp admitted he had been exhausted by last season, when multiple injuries damaged the team’s defence of the Premier League title and the pandemic forced football behind closed doors. But in early March, asked about staying beyond 2024, he said: “If I have the energy levels for it. That is important. I love what I do but I’ve said a couple of times there must be something else out there in the world, to be honest, apart from always thinking about properly skilled, good-looking, fantastically nice football players. But I really don’t think about it. “At the moment I am full of energy but we have to – I have to – make sure that is the case because I don’t want to sit around and be more tired than others and think: ‘Wow, why is everyone bothered about the things out there because I couldn’t care less?’” Liverpool’s outstanding form this season – they have won the Carabao Cup, face Chelsea in the FA Cup final, trail Manchester City by one point in the title race with five games left and are on course for a third Champions League final appearance in five seasons – has helped to re-energise Klopp. But he has also been enthused by the club’s long-term planning. The recruitment of Luis Díaz and Ibrahima Konaté has helped freshen the side, a deal is in place for Fulham’s Fabio Carvalho and there is interest in the Monaco midfielder Aurélien Tchouaméni, who is also coveted by Real Madrid. Work on the new Anfield Road stand is also well under way. There are other factors beyond Klopp’s energy levels surrounding a contract extension, however. The Liverpool manager is likely to want his trusted assistants Pepijn Lijnders and Peter Krawietz to commit their long-term futures to Anfield as well.",Sport/Football,Liverpool open talks to extend Jürgen Klopp’s contract beyond 2024,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/28/liverpool-open-talks-to-extend-jurgen-klopp-contract-beyond-2024
4/28/2022,"‘Children are not allowed on the bridge!” said Captain Picard in Star Trek: The Next Generation’s pilot episode. Nowadays, that attitude has softened, with Trek about to get its own animated series as an antidote to the smörgåsbord of F-bombs, Klingon boobs and decapitated Romulans that populate its live-action incarnations. Alongside Netflix’s Camp Cretaceous – which turns the Jurassic World franchise into a family-friendly cartoon – it’s part of a trend for creating versions of sci-fi shows for children that haven’t lost their power to shock – but won’t give kids nightmares. It’s a move that raises all sorts of questions. How scary is too scary? Who is allowed to die? And how do you stay true to the essence of a long-running franchise for grownups while reimagining it for a far younger audience? For the creators of Star Trek: Prodigy, the latter question was easy to address. They introduced a holographic version of one of Trek’s most popular characters – Voyager captain Kathryn Janeway – to help guide the group of alien kids who find themselves commanding an experimental Federation starship. For Prodigy’s writers, she was the perfect choice for a show catering to children. “She was our first female captain,” says Shawna Benson, who works on the show with her sister, Julie, “and she has a kind of Mama Grizzly protectiveness to her, especially with these kids.” Actor Kate Mulgrew, however, took a little more convincing. “I hesitated at first,” she tells me at Prodigy’s UK premiere in London. “Because Janeway was very significant to me. I thought, is this reductive? But then a lot of people said to me: ‘Are you crazy? Children will adore this, and their mothers will share it with them.’ So I called them back and said I’d love to do it.” For Mulgrew, reprising her steely captain for a young crowd means modulating her vocal performance. “I bring a sense of delight to my voice,” she says. “While the fear is real, I don’t want to scare them. I want them to understand we’re in a difficult situation, but we’re going to get out of it. Because if you go too far, children will back up.” When the creators of Camp Cretaceous were developing a kid-friendly version of the Jurassic World movies, they decided to do it by asking existential questions. “We asked ourselves, what is the DNA of the Jurassic franchise? Why do people watch these films?” says Zack Stentz, creator of Camp Cretaceous. “We decided you need those scary action beats, but you also need Spielbergian moments of awe and wonder.” Getting those scary moments right is a tricky balancing act when it comes to writing for kids. It can’t be too scary, but you also can’t go too far the other way – particularly if you’re being given input by the creator of Jurassic Park. “Everything to do with the Jurassic franchise goes to Steven Spielberg,” he says. “He’s shot down attempts to do animated shows in the past, and he only agreed this time on one condition: ‘Make it scary!’” For Stentz, this means finding new ways to present the same action we have seen at the cinema. “You keep the scariness but dial down the goriness,” he says. “People are going to get eaten, but not on camera. We play it on the reactions of the others, and you might hear a crunch. It’s very clear not everyone makes it out alive.” But there must be some red lines? After all, none of the kids end up as lunch. “So far!” Stentz laughs. I’m at least 90% sure he’s joking. In any case, children exist in their own, sometimes baffling, moral universe. A fellow parent told me her dino-obsessed five-year-old loves the Jurassic movies. “He doesn’t mind the people getting chomped,” she says. “As long as nothing bad happens to the dinosaurs.” It’s a view shared by the Camp Cretaceous writers, who take their lead from Jurassic World director Colin Trevorrow. “Colin always emphasises these aren’t monsters, they’re animals,” says Stentz. “In later seasons, the kids go from strict survival to the idea that they have a responsibility to the dinosaurs. We try to include an ecological consciousness, without hitting people over the head with it.” Prodigy takes a tamer approach. Over the past five decades, Star Trek might have included its fair share of nasty moments (particularly the terrifying alien earwigs from The Wrath of Khan that have lived rent free in my head for 30 years), but for the Benson sisters, working with Nickelodeon meant treading a fine line. “They have a very clear rule-set of what is and isn’t allowed,” says Julie. “It’s hard in a show where you’re in space and if you open a door you’re dead, but they were keen that it felt real without being too scary.” Rather than scares, morality takes a major role, with Prodigy wearing its sense of right-and-wrong on its sleeve – in finest Trek tradition. “We talked in the writers’ room about what we wanted kids to take out of each episode as a lesson,” says Shawna. “Working as a team, or being honest. They’re pretty basic tenets, but when you drill down you realise kids kind of know this stuff, but they kind of don’t.” In a move familiar to anyone brought up on classic cartoons such as He-Man and Captain Planet, every Prodigy episode is accompanied by a clip in which Mulgrew discusses its core lesson. “Those were new to us, but I think they’re wonderful,” says Julie. “They are so on the mark in terms of what we felt each episode was about.” The attempt to turn grown-up sci-fi franchises into kids’ TV series isn’t new. Back in the 1970s, a cheaply animated 24-minute cartoon rather boldly titled Star Trek continued the adventures of the original Enterprise after the live-action show’s cancellation. By the late 1980s, it seemed every movie franchise had its own kid-friendly spin-off, from The Real Ghostbusters and Ewoks to distinctly improbable retoolings of Robocop and Rambo. But now, with Prodigy, Camp Cretaceous and even a Fast and Furious spin-off, Spy Racers, it seems kid-friendly adaptations are in for a major revival. This time, though, they’re being created by people who were raised on the originals. “We were total Trek nerds growing up,” says Shawna. “I had all the episodes taped on VHS, time-stamped with the name of each episode. If you gave me a stardate, I could tell you which one it was!” “We never really had to think about how to write Star Trek for kids,” says Julie. “We just made the show we knew the eight- and 10-year-old us would have wanted.” And now, children are not just allowed on the bridge – they’re commanding it. Star Trek: Prodigy is on Nickelodeon now. Camp Cretaceous seasons 1-4 are on Netflix.",Arts/Television & radio, ‘People are going to get eaten!’ How to turn adult sci-fi into kids’ TV with bite,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/28/people-are-going-to-get-eaten-how-to-turn-adult-sci-fi-into-kids-tv-with-bite
4/28/2022,"In 2019, the Atlantic ran an opinion piece titled “The struggle for gay rights is over”. Written by the rightwing academic James Kirchick, the piece was obviously meant as a provocation, but its argument that “for those born into a form of adversity, sometimes the hardest thing to do is admitting that they’ve won” was at least considered cogent enough at the time to publish. It came towards the end of a slew of political victories for the LGBTQ+ cause. At that time, it seemed as though the US supreme court would hand down a landmark ruling immediately before Pride Weekend every couple of years. The demise of the homophobic Defense of Marriage Act in 2013 was followed by the end of the federal ban on marriage equality in 2015. Widespread acceptance of same-sex marriage rights, gay people serving in the military and the need for protections for LGBTQ+ people followed. As recently as 2020, the court, then with two Trump appointees, ruled that the 1964 Civil Rights Act protected gay, lesbian and transgender workers. For all the terrible crises of our century, LGBTQ+ people’s rights were solidly enshrined, and attitudes were shifting in line with legislation. In 1985, 89% of parents said they would be sad if they discovered their child was gay or a lesbian. By 2015, it was down to 39%. Yet in the past few months, those victories have come under threat as the US has witnessed a pronounced acceleration of anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric and legislation, fueled chiefly by misinformation about what it means to be trans and hysteria over so-called grooming. A rash of laws concerning the teaching of human sexuality in school curricula, banning trans student athletes and stripping parents of the right to help their gender-variant children obtain appropriate care have popped up in numerous red states this year. As same-sex marriage is now part of the fabric of America, conservatives have chosen to exploit Americans’ unfamiliarity with trans people and piggyback on parental anger over the perceived overreach of Covid-era school closures, conflating it with an insidious sense of “wokeness”, in the hopes of finding an electorally viable sluiceway for anti-LGBTQ+ hysteria. The most famous of these anti-LGBTQ+ laws is the piece of Florida legislation banning instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity in schools between kindergarten and third grade, the so-called “don’t say gay” law. “A state hasn’t passed a law like this in more than 20 years,” said Shannon Minter, the legal director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR) and a trans man. “Like many other people, I thought there was no way they would, because it’s so draconian and obviously unconstitutional.” Laying groundwork for a potential 2024 presidential campaign, Florida’s Trump-like governor, Ron DeSantis, has positioned the state as the last stronghold of liberty in America. The governor and his supporters have labeled as a “groomer” anyone who believes children can learn LGBTQ+ people exist, arguing that simply by talking about gay relationships to a child, you are sexualizing that child. DeSantis’ press secretary, Christina Pushaw, for example tweeted: “If you’re against the Anti-Grooming bill, you are probably a groomer or at least you don’t denounce the grooming of 4-8 year old children.” To be gay, in their view, is to be inherently sexualized, a threat to innocence in a way that straight Americans are not. Such vehemence has caught even veteran LGBTQ+ advocates by surprise. “At first, it was like 2015 again, with the bathroom bills, and I thought, ‘There’ll be a little pressure from national orgs and it’ll stop,’ but it didn’t,” says Ada Rhodes-Short, a roboticist and trans rights activist. “It started escalating and escalating.” For her, the catalyst was when Texas Republicans such as Greg Abbott and Ken Paxton, the governor and attorney general, not only banned gender-affirming medical care for trans youth but reframed their parents as child abusers, Paxton signing a 13-page legal opinion that parents or doctors who helped children transition were abusers who should be investigated by law enforcement. He was followed by Arizona’s governor, Doug Ducey, who, after barring minors from gender-affirmation treatment, wouldn’t even state for the record that trans people were real. Politicians are supported in the media by commentators like Tucker Carlson, who claimed “no one had heard of this trans thing four years ago”, or Charlie Kirk, channeling 1980s fears in saying “gays want to corrupt your children”. Newly rejuvenated, the right wing is poised to make transphobia and homophobia cornerstones of the midterms and 2024 elections, with promises to deliver “don’t say gay” legislation in states including Michigan and New York. Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, a conservative lobbying group, inveighed against the governors of Indiana and Utah for vetoing legislation banning trans women from participating in sports, calling the bills “timely, mainstream protections”. The Republican US representative Marjorie Taylor Greene vowed to introduce a federal “don’t say gay” bill if Republicans win the House this November, only to one-up herself days later by tweeting that for people to be pro-trans is to be pro-pedophilia. The dynamic is one of perpetual ratcheting-up. What began in Florida has the potential to spread nearly everywhere. Convinced that “there’s a culture shift happening and we need to be focused on survival”, Rhodes-Short and a dozen others co-founded Tear It Up. Modeled on Act Up, the organization that staged die-ins and other aggressive tactics to draw attention to the lack of funding for HIV/Aids, it is simultaneously confrontational and focused on mutual aid. “While we are under a huge attack, we can see what’s coming in November and the spring and we need to prepare for the next fight. People are running on insane nonsense, like trans people should face a firing squad,” says Rhodes-Short, referring to to Robert Foster, a former Mississippi lawmaker and gubernatorial candidate who said that anyone “advocating to put men pretending to be women in locker rooms and bathrooms with young women should receive the death penalty by firing squad”. Republican-dominated state legislatures have even begun bringing back North Carolina-style “bathroom bills” mandating that people use the facilities that correspond with the sex they were assigned at birth. “That started to supercharge this issue,” says Alejandra Caraballo, an attorney and instructor at Harvard University’s Cyberlaw Clinic. “That’s what DeSantis ran with. It’s the new tactic du jour. You saw Tucker Carlson saying that Disney supports the chemical castration and sexual grooming of children – stuff you would have heard two years ago and thought it was off the wall. Now it’s going to an audience of 4 million.” The business-friendly wing of the GOP that would quietly team up with Democrats to scuttle rabidly homophobic bills is now outnumbered, and legislators in a dozen or more states that lean even farther to right than DeSantis are taking note. Minter, the National Center for Lesbian Rights legal director, believes Florida is the test case for a renewed push for an aggressive, Christian-nationalist program. “That’s why it’s important that Disney has dramatically stepped up,” Minter says, referring to its initially uneven but increasingly vocal opposition to Florida’s new law. “The GOP is in an internal battle between the moderate, center-right legislators who have historically controlled the party and a very extreme Trumpian right wing that poses a threat not just to the Republican party but to our democracy,” he says. “We’re seeing that play out in real life. LGBTQ+ people and women and people of color are the primary targets.” The “don’t say gay” bill, Minter notes, is very similar to what’s been passed in Russia, tethering American conservatives to their authoritarian counterparts who have successfully rolled back democratic norms across eastern Europe. “There is a worldwide authoritarian resurgence and our country is not immune from that,” Minter says. “I’ve seen this movie before over the last 30 years: The right wing decided to target the LGBTQ community, whether it’s around marriage or adoption or trans kids playing sports or bathrooms,” says the California state senator Scott Wiener, who is gay. “One state does something, and then they all start proposing it.” Wiener introduced legislation to explicitly make California a refuge for families who may no longer feel that they can raise a queer or trans child in states such as Texas. “I thought it was really important to push back on the policy level, and to send a clear signal that California and other states really care about these kids,” he says. He believes that “don’t say gay” is “patently unconstitutional” but also contends that relying on the judicial system to protect human rights may no longer be a sound option. “Once the court lawlessly allowed that Texas abortion law to stay in place, that sent a powerful signal that we can’t rely on the courts,” Wiener said. “We have to rely on the political process.” But even that process has limits. Bella Blue, a burlesque dancer in New Orleans who is a pansexual, queer cis woman, homeschools a teenager whose stepfather is a trans man. Her child is “very aware” of the full spectrum of human sexuality, she says, but “he himself has not kind of landed” on a firm identity. “I guarantee you when they’re writing these bills, they’re not asking how the kids feel,” she says. “The only thing you can do is remember they’re going to turn out to be whoever they are.” The urge to legislate the diversity of human experience so it conforms with the Christian-nationalist project Minter points to seems certain to intensify. Although the confirmation of Ketanji Brown Jackson didn’t change the ideological balance of the supreme court, Republican senators’ opposition to her consisted mainly of conjuring up a nonexistent sympathy for child abuse images, tying her to the QAnon-led tropes about satanic child trafficking that seem ever closer to Republican orthodoxy. Indeed, conservatives’ messaging heading into 2024 feels like a hypercharged version of the eternal paranoia that America’s very existence is forever on the cusp of annihilation at the hands of liberals, immigrants, and LGBTQ+ people. The far-right One America Network recently called Joe Biden the “groomer-in-chief”, alleging that Democrats are now the party of perversion, gender “mutilation” and an end to human reproduction itself. This renewed movement, channeling itself through overheated rhetoric about “parents’ rights” that first gained traction during discussions of students masking up, now has the potential to undo much of the progress America has made on LGBTQ+ rights over the last 15 years.",News/US news,"After years of progress on gay rights, how did the US become so anti-LGBTQ+?",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/28/lgbtq-rights-us-dont-say-gay
4/28/2022,"Charles McCrory is haunted by a memory from his 1985 trial in which he was accused of murdering his wife, Julie Bonds, in a bloody attack at their home in Andalusia, a small town in deepest Alabama. What haunts him is the look on the jurors’ faces as they listened to the testimony of the prosecution’s star witness, a dentist named Richard Souviron. He was a founding father of a cutting-edge branch of forensic science known as bite-mark analysis, which claimed to be able to identify violent criminals by matching their unique dental patterns to the bite wounds on victims’ bodies. McCrory was expecting Souviron’s evidence to be nuanced. In his initial report, the dentist had been cautious about what could be deduced from two puncture marks found on the upper right arm of Julie’s body, saying that the injuries were insufficiently distinct to allow a positive match with the perpetrator. But that was not what he told the jury. When Souviron was asked whether the two marks were teeth marks, he said: “Yes”. Then the prosecutor asked him: “In your expert opinion, based on the evidence presented to you, were these teeth marks made by Charles McCrory?” “Yes,” the dentist replied. McCrory remembers vividly the sinking feeling he experienced in that moment, given the glaring contrast between Souviron’s initial report and what he was now saying in court. “I was in disbelief at his testimony being so different,” he recalled. “I knew it was extremely damaging to our case. You could see it in the eyes of the jurors.” McCrory shared his recollections of that critical instant in a handwritten letter he sent to the Guardian earlier this month. It was composed from an Alabama prison cell where he is serving a life sentence, still protesting his innocence, 37 years after the jury returned a guilty verdict based on that one simple word: “Yes.” McCrory’s current lawyer is Chris Fabricant. Together with co-counsel, Mark Loudon-Brown, Fabricant is representing the prisoner in an epic battle to clear his name almost four decades after he was identified as the source of those supposed teeth marks on his wife’s body. For Fabricant, this is much more than a routine criminal case. It is the latest chapter in a personal voyage that began 10 years ago, when he embarked on his exploration of the murky waters of forensic science. Fabricant is director of strategic litigation at the Innocence Project, the formidable New York-based non-profit that for 30 years has used DNA evidence to overturn hundreds of wrongful convictions. He is an authority on the perils and limitations of science as it has been applied to criminal justice. In that role, he has become one of forensic science’s most piercing critics. He has highlighted the part played by “expert witnesses” – forensic dentists, ballistics experts, FBI laboratory agents, lie detector examiners, blood stain investigators – in inadvertently putting innocent people behind bars. He has a word for it: junk science. In his new book, Junk Science and the American Criminal Justice System, Fabricant explains what he means by the term. “Junk science sounds like science,” he writes, “but there is no empirical base for the ‘expert opinion’; it is subjective speculation masquerading as science.” The world of junk science took off in the late 1960s and 70s – an era in which confidence about the ability of scientists to propel humanity to giddy new heights was unbound. If science could put a man on the moon, then surely it could do the much more mundane job of nailing violent criminals? Fabricant told the Guardian that there were problems with the new forensic science techniques from their inception. The methods did not arise out of the usual scientific method that starts with a problem, develops an hypothesis to solve it, then tests it via empirical methods. Rather, it turned the formula on its head. Start with a desired solution – banging up criminals – then work back to the science that would support it. “Most of the new theories emerged not from a scientific laboratory but from a crime scene,” Fabricant explained. “An enterprising investigator would think, ‘Maybe I could match this suspect’s teeth to the bite on this victim’s nose – that would prove the suspect is the murderer’. Then off they’d go and find an expert witness who could back the theory up.” The explosion in junk science began with forensic pathologists who, with the enthusiastic encouragement of the FBI’s legendary crime laboratory, began to invent a plethora of new forensic practices. The new generation of techniques had this in common: they all claimed to be able to identify an individual perpetrator through forensic analysis of various types of crime scene evidence. There was “hair microscopy” – the idea that a single hair retrieved from the scene of a murder could be put under the microscope and matched with high degrees of certainty to the suspect’s hair. There were lie detector tests sold under the portentous title “polygraphs”; voice spectrometry to identify a criminal through forensic deconstruction of their speech; “toolmark” analysis that sought to link marks found at a crime scene to a specific object – a pipe, perhaps, or hammer; and comparative bullet lead analysis that professed to be able to match a bullet found at the scene of a killing to the single box of bullets from which it originated. As use of the new techniques began to spread across the US, the reputation of forensic pathologists soared. They were invited to attend specialist conferences around the world, and lauded as “medical detectives”. Celebrity status wasn’t far behind. One of the earliest stars of the genre, New York’s medical examiner Dr Milton Helpern, was called “Sherlock Holmes with a microscope”. His successor, Dr Michael Baden, was given his own HBO TV series in the 1970s. Autopsy showcased a new forensic technique each week, highlighting the wonders they performed in solving gruesome and knotty crimes. Baden later went on to be involved in high-profile cases such as the OJ Simpson trial and the autopsy of Michael Brown, the unarmed Black teenager shot dead by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. Following the rise of such celebrities, it was but a step to forensic science becoming infused into the popular imagination. TV shows that had lionized vice cops and FBI special agents now began to switch their soft-focus lenses on to forensic pathologists. Forensic Files aired from 1996 to 2005. CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, a formidably popular show aired between 2000 and 2015, looked at how forensic scientists cracked the hardest criminal cases. Once this glowing view of forensics had taken hold of the small screen, it was inevitable that it would seep into the mindset of juries. “These TV shows depict an unrealistic infallibility of forensic sciences which became part of our popular culture,” Fabricant said. “Jurors walk into court believing that if it is forensic science that ties this defendant to the crime, then the likelihood of their guilt is overwhelming.” With forensic pathologists soaking up so much glamorous TV coverage, it was only a matter of time before dentists wanted in on the game. By the late 1970s, as Fabricant chronicles in his book, “forensic odontology” was starting to emerge, pioneered by a small number of individuals who were portrayed as “swashbuckling crime fighters, handsome, fit, bawdy, prone to ghoulish humor, comfortable with dead bodies, brilliant. Men’s men.” Fabricant quotes the Los Angeles Times remarking admiringly that one of those pioneers, Dr Gerald Vale, hadn’t fixed a tooth in years. “His job is to fill jail cells, not cavities,” the paper gushed. An industry newsletter said about Vale: “Instead of tracking down decay, he tracks down people!” What united the group of 12 “founding fathers” of forensic odontology was the belief that bite mark evidence could be used as a new tool up there with fingerprints, toxicology and other established methods. But to be taken seriously, the pioneers needed to establish their reputation, and for that they needed to be recognized as a scientific specialism as worthy of respect as any pathologist. They began in 1976 by forming an “odontology section” within America’s top professional forensics body, the American Academy of Forensic Sciences. Not content with playing second fiddle, they then created their own organization, the American Board of Forensic Odontology (ABFO). As icing on the cake, they granted themselves a fancy title: “diplomates”, they called themselves, signaling their specialist status as trained and authoritative experts. So when Souviron travelled the country to appear as a star expert witness in criminal cases such as McCrory’s murder trial, he did so not as Richard Souviron, dentist from Florida, but as Dr Richard Souviron, board-certified diplomate and member of the ABFO. How could a jury resist that? “This was 1985, when to fly an ‘expert’ witness in from Florida was practically unheard of,” McCrory wrote in his letter to the Guardian, referring to his own trial. “No jury, as lay people, have the ability to genuinely question a supposed expert, especially back then.” The problem was, bite mark analysis, like many of the new forensic techniques, was founded upon so much hot air. There are two stages involved in matching a wound to an individual perpetrator, and both of them are flakey. The first is categorically to confirm that the wound is caused by someone’s teeth and not by some other sharp object. The second stage is to link the alleged bite mark to the dental pattern of the suspect, by taking a mould of the suspect’s teeth and comparing it to the wound. Analysis in both those stages, contrary to the scientific method, is subjective. A study published in 2009 by New York scientists tested whether skin could accurately record the impressions left by teeth – the 3D-equivalent of a fingerprint – and found that it could not. The scientists simulated 23 identical bites on a single piece of un-embalmed cadaver skin. They discovered that the bites produced 23 entirely different marks, each one bearing little resemblance to the rest. A more detailed study in 2015, carried out by ABFO-certified forensic dentists themselves, asked 38 of their fellow “diplomates” to review photographs presented in real criminal cases where bite mark analysis had been used. Of the 100 cases they examined, the analysts reached unanimous agreement in only four. These two experiments effectively toppled the entire house of cards upon which bite mark analysis had been erected. In his book, Fabricant concludes that when forensic dentists presented juries with a “near certain” match between the marks on a victim and a suspect – as Souviron did at McCrory’s trial – all they were doing was expressing their own personal opinion. It is a paradox that it took science to overcome junk science. “Nothing else could have challenged it other than DNA evidence, because a clean DNA sample is indisputable,” Fabricant said. “DNA was like a truth serum that the justice system had never before been exposed to.” Over the years, DNA analysis has demonstrated itself to be blessed with all the qualities that junk science claims to enjoy but lacks: reliability, certainty, accuracy, indisputability. The DNA revolution was launched in 1992 when two young lawyers in New York City decided to take on the combined might of the criminal justice system just as it was getting into its mass incarceration stride. Barry Sheck and Peter Neufeld founded the Innocence Project to take on cases where crime scene evidence allowed DNA testing to be carried out. They used it to expose wrongful convictions and secure exonerations – more than 200 to date attained by the Innocence Project alone. As time passed, the group’s crack team of lawyers observed that in so many of the wrongful convictions, the prosecution had relied upon the testimony of forensic scientists. Almost half of the total of 375 exonerations that have been achieved by the Innocence Project and other groups using DNA evidence involved the misuse of forensic sciences. The dawning realization that junk science might have put a vast mountain of innocent people behind bars has inspired the Innocence Project to make a historic revision of its mission. As it approaches its 30th anniversary this year, the organization has decided to widen the net of cases that it takes on to include those where no DNA evidence is available. That’s a big change in focus. Up to now, the Innocent Project has pinpointed its energies almost exclusively on DNA. But what about people who cannot call on DNA to prove their innocence, maybe because there were insufficient crime scene materials, or maybe because such materials were destroyed post-trial? Are those people to be abandoned with little hope of ever receiving justice? “Those who can be exonerated with DNA evidence represent just the tip of the iceberg,” Christina Swarns, the executive director of the Innocence Project, told the Guardian. “Going forward, the Innocence Project will begin to accept non-DNA cases and we will approach them with the same tenacity, innovation and client-centered approach we brought to our DNA work.” This is a significant paradigm shift for an organization that put the concept of wrongful conviction on the map, both in the United States and around the world. By widening its focus to include non-DNA cases, Fabricant believes it will herald “a new era of innocence litigation that will involve undoing the legacy of junk science”. Which prompts the question: how many innocent people are out there? “I shudder to think,” Fabricant said. “There are 2.3 million people incarcerated in this country. Even if the wrongful conviction rate were 1% , and that’s conservative, you are looking at tens of thousands of people.” Fabricant is convinced that McCrory, who is now 62, is one of them. “Mr McCrory is obviously innocent, and he would be out right now if we had DNA evidence.” Julie Bonds was murdered on 31 May 1985 in her home in Andalusia, south Alabama. McCrory was not living in the house at the time – the couple had recently separated after 10 years of marriage; they had one son together. McCrory and his father discovered her body after they called on the house, worried that she was not answering the phone. She had been badly beaten, and had a deep wound to her skull. The 1985 McCrory trial was held just before DNA analysis came on stream – the first time DNA was used to convict someone was in Florida in 1987, while the first DNA exoneration followed two years later in Chicago. Because it was presumed to serve no further useful purpose, all the crime scene materials collected in the Bonds murder investigation were destroyed – a routine event in pre-DNA days. That left no biological samples to test once DNA was commonplace. Detectives investigating the Bonds murder actually found hairs clutched in the hand of McCrory’s murdered wife that conventional examinations conducted at the time ruled out as having come from him. But the hairs, along with everything else, were binned. Other evidence also pointed to McCrory’s innocence. At the time of Bonds’ killing, a construction worker was being employed on a building project in the house next door. He wore a red bandana. Five weeks after Julie Bonds was murdered, that same man was arrested for breaking into a different home and raping the owner. He served 20 years in prison. At that crime scene, officers found a red bandana. Despite the inconsistencies in his case, McCrory was at a powerful disadvantage. Without the benefit of DNA to clear his name, he languished in prison for decades. Meanwhile, however, bitemark analysis was beginning to unravel. In 2009 – by which time McCrory had spent 24 years in prison – the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) released a 300-page report on the use of forensic science that sent what Fabricant called a “thunderbolt” across the criminal justice system. It was searingly critical of 13 forensic techniques that were routinely being used in criminal trials. It reserved its most scathing denunciation for bitemark analysis. The report’s authors noted that the claim that dentists could positively identify a perpetrator by matching their dental patterns to marks on victims’ bodies had never been supported by any scientific study. Indeed, “no large population studies have been conducted”. In other words, bitemark analysis was an unsubstantiated whim on the part of its inventors. The report concluded that there was “no evidence of an existing scientific basis for identifying an individual to the exclusion of all others”. The combined impact of the NAS report and DNA evidence led to a renewed focus on criminal cases where bitemark analysis had been critical to the prosecution. Scientific certainty began to crumble. Exonerations mounted up. Today, the tally of people who have been exonerated after wrongful indictment or conviction involving bitemark analysis stands at 35. They include several of Fabricant’s clients: Keith Allen Harward, exonerated in 2016 after spending 33 years in prison for a rape and murder he did not commit; Stephen Chaney, exonerated in 2019 after 28 years behind bars; Eddie Lee Howard, exonerated in 2020 – 26 years inside. They were the lucky ones. David Wayne Spence was convicted of murdering three teenagers in 1982 after his teeth were matched to bite marks on the victims’ bodies. On 3 April 1997, he was strapped to a gurney and lethal drugs injected into his veins. He went to his death insisting he was innocent. In December 2019, Souviron recanted his testimony. He had taken another look at the evidence in the case, considered it alongside the criticisms raised by the NAS report, and went on the record to say he had been wrong. “While this testimony was understood by myself and others within my field as scientifically acceptable at the time of trial, I would not give [it] today,” he said in an affidavit. “As a forensic odontologist I no longer believe the individualised teeth marks comparison testimony I offered in his case was reliable or proper. I therefore renounce that testimony.” The Guardian reached out to Souviron to ask him how he came to change his thinking so radically, but his office said he was not available. The dentist’s reversal was sweet music to McCrory’s ears. “We knew a recantation from the state’s own witness, their only forensic witness, would eviscerate their case. At that point the only fair way forward would be a new trial,” the prisoner wrote. McCrory duly petitioned for a new trial. With no forensic evidence of any sort, and with no other substantive evidence to rely upon, the state’s tank was running on empty. Even the prosecutors admitted that McCrory posed no harm to the public. In April last year, on the eve of a court hearing to determine whether a new trial should be granted, the prisoner was offered a plea deal. He could walk free, that very same day, on one condition. He had to plead guilty to his wife’s murder. He declined the deal, opting to stay in his cell. “That was an easy decision,” he wrote in his letter to the Guardian. “I did not murder her … I didn’t do it, and I’m not admitting to it.” He added: “Someone murdered Julie. Someone knows who it is. We are seeking the truth, not falsely confessing to a crime I didn’t commit.” Many people would find McCrory’s rejection of a deal that would have instantly set him free hard to comprehend. Fabricant is among them. “I can understand it in an intellectual way, but as a human being I think after 36 years I’d want to go home,” he said. McCrory still hasn’t gone home. It has now been 37 years and counting. The bitemark case against him has been thoroughly debunked, but it turns out that doesn’t matter. Junk science proves to be scarily resilient – an invasive weed that grows rampant across the country, poisoning the criminal justice system as it spreads. A few days after McCrory turned down the plea deal, an evidentiary hearing was held in front of Judge Charles Short in Andalusia, Alabama, to discuss the request for a new trial. Souviron’s recantation was presented to the court, as was the testimony of three other forensic dentists who not only confirmed that the marks on Julie Bond’s body could not be matched to the prisoner, they said that the marks were not even caused by teeth in the first place. Judge Short listened to this devastating argument, took in all the other evidence of McCrory’s innocence, then issued his ruling: there would be no new trial; McCrory would remain in prison. Fabricant was uncharacteristically lost for words when he tried to describe his reaction to the judgment. “How can that be? How can that be? It’s preposterous. We are in 2022 and a judge is refusing a new trial even when the scientist in question has recanted. He is keeping an innocent man in prison based on nothing.” Despite the knock-back, McCrory says he is keeping his spirits up. “I’m optimistic that justice will prevail,” he wrote at the end of his letter. “Every time we have run into a seemingly dead-end, a door has opened. We will not stop until we have the truth.” This will be scant comfort to McCrory, but he is not alone. Fabricant points out that bitemark analysis is still admissible in all 50 states of the union. Three of the most influential bitemark cases where marks were matched to “guilty” perpetrators have all ended in exonerations. Yet the cases retain their status as “good law” and continue to be cited as precedent in court to this day. In the wider world of junk science, not only do discredited techniques continue to be used, but new techniques keep popping up. Fabricant rattles off three examples of forensic innovations that are beginning to ring alarm bells. There’s forensic podiatry, where foot doctors claim they can identify a perpetrator from their gait; cadaver dogs which are supposedly able to sniff out the presence of a human corps even years after the body may have been present; and ShotSpotter, an audio system that purports to be able to isolate the sound of gun shots from other noise in urban areas. If that all sounds depressingly familiar, that’s because it is. “Our goal in the Innocence Project is to go out of business – we aspire to become unnecessary,” Fabricant said. “It appears we are going to be around for a very long time to come.”",News/US news,"A bite mark, a forensic dentist, a murder: how junk science ruins innocent lives ",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/28/forensics-bite-mark-junk-science-charles-mccrory-chris-fabricant
4/28/2022,"There will be at least 15,000 instances of viruses leaping between species over the next 50 years, with the climate crisis helping fuel a “potentially devastating” spread of disease that will imperil animals and people and risk further pandemics, researchers have warned. As the planet heats up, many animal species will be forced to move into new areas to find suitable conditions. They will bring their parasites and pathogens with them, causing them to spread between species that haven’t interacted before. This will heighten the risk of what is called ‘zoonotic spillover’, where viruses transfer from animals to people, potentially triggering another pandemic of the magnitude of Covid-19. “As the world changes, the face of disease will change too,” said Gregory Albery, an expert in disease ecology at Georgetown University and co-author of the paper, published in Nature. “This work provides more incontrovertible evidence that the coming decades will not only be hotter, but sicker. “We have demonstrated a novel and potentially devastating mechanism for disease emergence that could threaten the health of animals in the future and will likely have ramifications for us, too.” Albery said that climate change is “shaking ecosystems to their core” and causing interactions between species that are already likely to be spreading viruses. He said that even drastic action to address global heating now won’t be enough to halt the risk of spillover events. “This is happing, it’s not preventable even in the best case climate change scenarios and we need to put measures in place to build health infrastructure to protect animal and human populations,” he said. The research paper states that at least 10,000 types of virus capable of infecting humans are circulating “silently” in wild animal populations. Until relatively recently, such crossover infections were unusual but as more habitat has been destroyed for agriculture and urban expansion, more people have come into contact with infected animals. Climate change is exacerbating this problem by helping circulate disease between species that previously did not encounter each other. The study forecast the geographic range shifts of 3,139 mammal species due to climatic and land use changes until 2070 and found that even under a relatively low level of global heating there will be at least 15,000 cross-species transmission events of one or more viruses during this time. Bats will account for the majority of this disease spread because of their ability to travel large distances. An infected bat in Wuhan in China is a suspected cause of the start of the Covid pandemic and previous research has estimated there are about 3,200 strains of coronaviruses already moving among bat populations. The risk of climate-driven disease is not a future one, the new research warns. “Surprisingly, we find that this ecological transition may already be under way, and holding warming under 2C within the century will not reduce future viral sharing,” the paper states. Much of the disease risk is set to center upon high elevation areas in Africa and Asia, although a lack of monitoring is set make it difficult to track the progress of certain viruses. “There is this monumental and mostly unobserved change happening within ecosystems,” said Colin Carlson, another co-author of the research. “We aren’t keeping an eye on them and it makes pandemic risk everyone’s problem. Climate change is creating innumerable hotspots for zoonotic risk right in our backyard. We have to build health systems that are ready for that.” Experts not involved in the research said the study highlighted the urgent need to improve processes designed to prevent future pandemics, as well as to phase out the use of the fossil fuels that are causing the climate crisis. “The findings underscore that we must, absolutely must, prevent pathogen spillover,” said Aaron Bernstein, interim director of the center for climate, health, and the global environment at Harvard University. “Vaccines, drugs and tests are essential but without major investments in primary pandemic prevention, namely habitat conservation, strictly regulating wildlife trade, and improved livestock biosecurity, as examples, we will find ourselves in a world where only the rich are able to endure ever more likely infectious disease outbreaks.” Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, a nonprofit that works on pandemic prevention, said that while human interference in landscapes has been understood as a disease risk for a while, the new research represents a “critical step forward” in the understanding of how climate change will fuel the spread of viruses. “What’s even more concerning is that we may already be in this process – something I didn’t expect and a real wake-up call for public health,” he said. “In fact, if you think about the likely impacts of climate change, if pandemic diseases are one of them, we’re talking trillions of dollars of potential impact. “This hidden cost of climate change is finally illuminated, and the vision this paper shows us is a very ugly future for wildlife and for people.”",News/Environment,‘Potentially devastating’: Climate crisis may fuel future pandemics,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/28/climate-crisis-future-pandemics-zoonotic-spillover
4/28/2022,"For the 2005 film Everything Is Illuminated, the Ukrainian-born Gypsy punk rocker Eugene Hütz returned to his home country to play Alex, a hip-hop-loving, liberty-taking tourist guide for American Jews. The musician’s own life couldn’t be more different – as the frontman for raucous, multicultural band Gogol Bordello, he has been a longtime fixture on the arts scene of the Lower East Side in New York and toured with Madonna. But now, as the world watches Ukraine defend itself against Russia, Hütz finds himself taking on the role of a real-life guide to Ukrainian culture for westerners who have previously shown little interest. “One of the things that I’m trying to debunk is that I’m some first guy from behind the iron curtain that got into western pop culture,” says the 49-year-old. “Tommy Ramone, who started the Ramones, escaped with his family from Budapest when Russian tanks rolled in there in 1956. He was a political refugee from the east bloc because of communist invasion.” The late Ivan Král, who collaborated with Patti Smith, Iggy Pop and David Bowie, “was born and raised in Prague and emigrated [to the US] when Russian tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia. People like that, in the very fabric of punk rock, their underdog energy was coming from a real place.” Hütz has rushed down from a recording session on his roof to talk to me on a video call. “I was trying to find something less bouncy, sound-wise,” he says of the Ukrainian charity song he has created with the Primus frontman, Les Claypool, Sean Lennon and the Police drummer, Stewart Copeland, joined by Hütz’s bandmate Sergey Ryabtsev on violin and Billy Strings on guitar. Man With the Iron Balls is a paean to Volodymyr Zelenskiy. This is just one element of his non-stop activity in support of Ukraine since Russia invaded on 24 February, which includes a Gogol Bordello world tour starting in the US on 4 May. It will rip through Europe, ending with a final date listed, defiantly, as the UPark festival in Kyiv on 15 July. He props his phone up, sits back against a wall of white fitted wardrobes and takes a meditative deep breath through his nose. “A lot of my friends from punk and hardcore bands had songs for Ukraine three days into the war,” he says. Among the first to get in touch was “Jello Biafra from Dead Kennedys. Patti Smith was very supportive – we started a wave of fundraisers pretty much right away. So much respect to legit people like Pink Floyd: Dave Gilmour just put out a song. But, as always, it’s punk and hardcore that’s way ahead of the others on issues like that.” The Gogol Bordello experience isn’t what you would call hardcore punk. “That’s why I came up with this term ‘joy core’,” says Hütz. He sums this up as a “flamboyant zest” for life. His first fundraising event in New York, starring Smith, along with Suzanne Vega and Craig Finn of the Hold Steady, raised $130,000 (£103,000): $50,000 came from Lennon and Yoko Ono, who had wanted to attend but couldn’t. Smith and Hütz dueted on the Ukrainian national anthem. Hütz grew up in Kyiv and says his family is a mix of Ukrainian, Romany and Lithuanian, so “all my grandparents spoke very rootical [sic] Ukrainian”. Growing up in the Soviet Union, he had to speak Russian, too. “Especially in the capital,” he says, “the Russification was very aggressive. The majority of schools were Russian, with some classes of Ukrainian literature and language, just to keep people pacified so they didn’t totally freak out and start picking up cobblestones and looting government buildings.” But people who spoke Russian or had Russian last names, he says, were rewarded. “They would give them better apartments and better jobs.” In a coded way, he says, teachers were able to “convey that this territory is occupied by emphasising Ukrainian pronunciation of towns, and original costumes and original ways of Ukrainian culture, holidays like Ivana-Kupala [an ancient gathering in honour of Slavic sun gods]. You know, just threading, threading, threading them into our knowledge. There was a part of the population that was pretty bleached out and Sovietised, no doubt. Luckily, I was not from a family that had any illusions about it.” He says he lived first in central Kyiv, and then moved to the outskirts, in a place he compares to the Bronx. “Industrial and just sand and cement blocks – not particularly prestigious, very working class. That’s where punk rock flourished.” By 13, he was writing for fanzines and loading other bands’ equipment and “helping organise stuff” on the punk rock scene. People often ask whether it was a big culture shock when he moved to the US in 1990, aged 17. “What culture shock?” he says. “I basically went from lugging a kick drum on my back up the stairs in Ukraine, to lugging a kick drum down the stairs into the basement here. Punk rock is a kind of a cultural corridor.” Hütz’s family were able to cross the iron curtain, he says, “thanks to Gorbachev – another awesome Ukrainian [his mother was Ukrainian] – who basically debunked the entire false history of the Soviet Union and kind of made it go away … We had enough reasons, as a family with continuous Soviet abuse, to qualify as political refugees.” His father, who was also in a band, was seen as provocative, “a notorious anti-Soviet guy on the block, who always listened to BBC radio and spoke English and listened to rock’n’roll, and was constantly under suspicion that he was some kind of spy. And that can really reflect on your level of life and not being able to really get anywhere.” Hütz and his parents left Ukraine in 1989 with whatever they could carry in their hands – a few heirlooms, his tapes of Ukrainian punk bands and a brown leather jacket – and lived in refugee camps in Poland, Hungary, Austria and Italy before making it to the US. What does he most remember from that time? “It’s a PTSD kind of thing,” he says. “Time goes on, but I can easily get into that frame of mind. Because it’s the kind of experience that is 100% trauma. But I’m not saying it here for whining reasons.” For him, it’s an illustration of the Ukrainian spirit. “We know how to turn just about any kind of suffering or injustice into a source of strength. What you’re witnessing right now – the heroism of Ukrainian people, the heroism of the president, who just totally rose to the occasion, is mindblowing to the world. It’s more known to Ukrainians themselves – something that we always can count on.” It’s this resilience that he drew on to keep his underground punk band going for so long, as they toured constantly. He says that, before Gogol Bordello became more widely noticed in 2005, after their fourth album, Gypsy Punks: Underdog World Strike, was released, “the band had been around for almost nine years, with 10 people in a van, sleeping on the floor in one room”. The move to the relative comforts that come with international recognition made him realise “all the levels where Ukrainian people can go without comfort, which are unthinkable for people in the west: the minute they don’t get the right kind of cream into their coffee, they’re like flipping out. It’s amusing.” Not that it’s not “awesome that life here is so tremendously comfortable. That’s a real relief in a lot of ways.” But that’s no excuse to ignore suffering elsewhere. “I don’t care if you grew up with an iPhone implanted in your brain … people get so lost in ’conspiranoia’, where they can’t see straight, even with the situation in Ukraine, which is the fight of Ukrainian people against the oppressor that’s been going on for hundreds of years.” Even intelligent people, he says, “fall into confusion … People fall for the most moronic notions like, oh yeah, of course the US is behind it. Dude, do you understand how America-centric that idea is?” Hütz visits Ukraine often, witnessing its shift since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. It, along with other former Soviet countries, has been reclaiming and celebrating its own culture. “A lot of the things that were branded by Moscow as supposedly Russian are not Russian at all, but usually a cultural theft from a more culturally developed neighbouring country, like Georgia, or Poland, or Finland.” Even Russian dolls, he says, were repurposed from Japan. “As far as literature goes,” he continues, “Gogol is a Ukrainian writer. Which is why I took the name for the band, to keep telling the story. Chekhov was born in Ukraine. Mikhail Bulgakov, who wrote The Master and Margarita, he’s from Kyiv.” And in the world of painting, “Kazimir Malevich is always called Russian – he was a Ukrainian Polish guy who identified as a Ukrainian Polish guy. The list goes on.” Food comes next. “People go: ‘Oh, I want to get some borsch.’ You want to get some borsch? Go and get it in a Ukrainian restaurant. That’s where it came from.” And don’t even get him started on dance. “All the supposedly Russian dancing that everybody loves,” he says, “with people doing acrobatic, unbelievable things very high up in the air, wearing red pants? That’s an old Ukrainian fitness programme from the middle ages. That’s Cossack dancing, because that was their way of staying fit, appropriated and stolen by Moscow and branded as some kind of Russian accomplishment. But we’ve already taken that back, firmly.” Even Russia’s favourite folk song, Black Eyes, is, he says, “a song written by a Ukrainian poet on a German melody”. Music has played a role in the current crisis, in raising money abroad and on the frontline. Westerners have told Hütz they “can’t really process how come there’s so much TikTok, YouTube and Instagram clips from the frontline of people in the trenches with instruments, making music and singing and letting the steam out. They almost find it to be baffling, but that’s not baffling at all if you’re Ukrainian – this is how we do it.” In historical Ukrainian paintings, he says, “you will find scenes where a Cossack is sitting with a sword and a musical instrument across his shoulders”. Hütz recently posted a video of a group of women, in matching embroidered deep red costumes, singing the story of the current Russian invasion. They’re part of a long tradition of Ukrainian women choirs singing storytelling ballads. A translation he posted with this clip includes the lines: “And armoured personnel carriers were in flames / The Muscovites stood nearby / They were in complete stupor / Burning bastards were in flames.” “That one was a 300- to 400-year-old melody,” he says. “Truly archetypal and ancient in the manner of delivery. But very modern in the events described, and using modern slang.” The women look so well put together that I assume they were far from the frontline, but Hütz looks at me like I’m crazy. “They’re in Kyiv. My whole family is in Kyiv right now.” He’s in touch with his relatives on a daily basis and says the bolstering effects of international solidarity should not be underestimated. “When people are driving around rural Ukraine with their children, armed and trying to get to the safe place, or if they’re in the trenches fighting, people are prone to feel fractured and disconnected and forlorn. Any bit of information that, hey, out there somewhere in the UK, there is a concert going on in support of us; in France, people right now are by the embassy demanding support; that there are real people in real time doing something, it still means a lot.” Does it feel like the first time the world has ever been behind Ukraine? “I mean, it’s never been behind Ukraine. It totally failed to be behind Ukraine in 2014. Same thing happened – it’s not like it’s a new thing.” He believes the current crisis could have been averted if the world had risen to the occasion back then. Even in the music world, he says, “a lot of older supposed freedom fighters, who are the first ones to sing the songs of freedom when nothing’s going on and it’s all peachy – a lot of those people are the biggest fakes in the world, milking the naivety of the coolest audiences. The freedom-fighting image sells well when there’s nothing to fight for. Once it’s really time to step up, you’re gonna need a really big torch to find them.” Not that Hütz himself originally set out to educate the world about eastern Europe. “Believe me, that’s not really my thing,” he says. “And, truth be told, Ukrainians are pretty humble. Which is probably why things were easily hijacked from them for so long. We’re like, well, we’re rich in culture, so it ain’t gonna hurt us.” Gogol Bordello’s Solidaritine world tour starts on 4 May, with part of the proceeds going to Ukraine",Arts/Music,‘We Ukrainians know how to turn suffering into strength’: Gogol Bordello’s Eugene Hütz on his musical resistance ,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/28/gogol-bordello-eugene-hutz-russian-cultural-thefts-ukraine-punk-soviet-musicians
4/28/2022,"Labourers at the one of the world’s largest egg factories arrived at the plant in Rembrandt, Iowa, early one morning in March to discover they were about to work themselves out of a job. As they gathered at the huge barns housing stacks of caged hens, the workers were told to forget about their usual routine of collecting eggs and feeding the birds. Overnight, the factory had begun slaughtering more than 5 million chickens using a gruesome killing method after detecting a single case of avian influenza. Even supervisors were assigned to the arduous task of dragging dead hens out of packed cages as Rembrandt Enterprises raced to contain the spread of the virus amid the largest bird flu outbreak in the US in seven years. The culling has been repeated at chicken and turkey farms across Iowa and 28 other states from Maine to Utah. More than 22 million birds have been killed in an attempt to contain the outbreak – the majority in Iowa, the US’s biggest producer of eggs. The slaughter of 5.3 million hens at Rembrandt is the largest culling at any factory farm in the country. Workers spent nearly a month pulling the dead poultry from the cages and dumping them in carts before they were piled high in nearby fields and then buried in huge pits. The killing over, about 250 people were summarily thrown out of work with just a few dozen skeleton staff remaining. In the weeks that followed, animal rights protesters targeted Rembrandt’s billionaire owner, Glen Taylor, over the culling, including disrupting games played by a professional basketball team he owns, the Minnesota Timberwolves. But few voices have been raised in support of Rembrandt’s workers, some of them undocumented migrants. Others fired from the plant contrast the seriousness with which the bird flu outbreak has been taken by Rembrandt’s management to what they describe as the company’s lax approach to the threat to workers from Covid-19 as it swept through factory farms and slaughterhouses in Iowa and elsewhere. “So right now everybody’s worried about the chickens,” said Oscar Garcia, a former supervisor at the plant. “We get it, it was really inhumane the way they killed them. But chickens are chickens, right? People worked in those barns pulling out dead birds in terrible conditions, faeces everywhere, doing 12 or 14 hour days. They couldn’t protest because then they’d be fired and lose their redundancy pay. Then they’re thrown out of work and no one speaks for them.” Outside criticism of Rembrandt has focused on the method of killing. Chicken farms have previously slaughtered hens en masse by suffocating them with foam or pumping barns full of carbon dioxide, methods that have been criticized as inhumane. But Tom Cullen of the Iowa paper the Storm Lake Times revealed that birds at Rembrandt were culled using a system known as Ventilation Shutdown Plus (VSD+) in which air is closed off to the barns and heat pumped in until the temperature rises above 104F (40C). “They cooked those birds alive,” said one of the Rembrandt workers involved in the culling. An animal rights group, Animal Outlook, used freedom of information laws to obtain records of experiments at North Carolina State University that show that VSD+ causes “extreme suffering” to the hens as they “writhe, gasp, pant, stagger and even throw themselves against the walls of their confinement in a desperate attempt to escape”. “Eventually the birds collapse and, finally, die from heat and suffocation,” the group said. Members of another group, Direct Action Everywhere, have disrupted Timberwolves games in recent weeks wearing T-shirts proclaiming “Glen Taylor Roasts Animals Alive”. James Roth, director of the Center for Food Security and Public Health at Iowa state university’s college of veterinary medicine and an adviser to the federal government on biosecurity, acknowledged that VSD+ causes more suffering than other forms of culling but said it is the most efficient means of containing the spread of bird flu because it is relatively swift. “Nobody wants to see it used but sometimes it is as a last resort. The rationale is if the influenza virus spreads so fast that it’ll go through a poultry house really rapidly, all of those birds produce massive amounts of virus in the air. Then you have a big plume of virus coming from that house that spreads to other poultry houses. It’s critical to get the birds euthanised before that virus becomes a huge plume of virus to spread,” he said. Roth said that the authorities appear to have learned important lessons from 2015, when a bird flu outbreak resulted in what the US agriculture department calls “the largest poultry health disaster in US history”, with the slaughter of about 50 million chickens and turkeys. This time federal regulators moved quickly to contain the outbreak by shutting down the movement of workers between poultry flocks, a significant cause of the spread of avian flu in 2015. But Roth said this year the virus appears to have arrived in the US carried by waterfowl from Europe and to be better adapted to be spread by wild birds, which are harder to contain. That prompted the USDA to press for a swift culling at infected poultry farms. On 17 March, Rembrandt notified its supervisors that avian flu had been detected on the site. “They sent out email at 10.30pm letting us know they had a confirmed case,” said a former Rembrandt worker who was obliged to sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to receive redundancy payments. When the worker arrived the next day he discovered the company had already begun slaughtering millions of chickens. “Once they’re dead, we had to take them out by hand one by one, put them in a wheelbarrow. That’s really intense manual labour. They are not very big cages. Twelve chickens are crammed in there. Awful conditions,” he said. “After it was over, we were told to attend a meeting. We walked in. There was a big stack of yellow envelopes. That’s like showing a knife to a chicken. You know what’s going to happen next. We worked ourselves out of a job. I saw people who had years and years of experience just being let go. It was totally unexpected.” Some workers thought the layoff might be temporary, as it was during the 2015 outbreak. But they were given redundancy payments and told to find other jobs, suggesting the move was permanent and raising questions about the future of the plant. Some of the skilled former workers have had little trouble finding another job. Others have struggled. “I’m just rushing to find a job in order to support my family,” said a former Rembrandt employee with several years at the company. Those struggling include undocumented workers who, Garcia said, were hired indirectly through third-party contractors. In February, the Storm Lake Times reported that a lawsuit by the family of a Guatemalan migrant worker who was crushed to death when cages collapsed on him revealed that he had been working under a false name through a subcontractor. Garcia also contrasted the seriousness with which Rembrandt took bird flu to the company’s handling of Covid-19 as it surged in Iowa, particularly among labourers working close together on factory farms and in slaughterhouses. He said Rembrandt appeared to care more about avian flu outbreaks than Covid. He criticised the management for failing to require workers to wear a mask or to be vaccinated. “They actually liked the fact that we didn’t require our employees to get vaccinated because they were hoping we would get employees from the surrounding areas that were requiring their employees to get vaccinated. They’re using it almost as a recruitment tool,” he said. Other workers said that when they contracted Covid, they were obliged to use the days off they had earned as holidays instead of being given sick days. “It’s a company that makes millions of dollars. I guess I shouldn’t be surprised that it doesn’t care about people,” said Garcia.

4/28/2022,"Over the past several years, farm workers have held protests and hunger strikes on college campuses, outside of corporate headquarters, at annual shareholders meetings, and in cities around the US, and called for a public boycott to demand the fast food corporate chain Wendy’s join the Fair Food Program. The Fair Food Program was launched in 2011 by the Coalition of Immokalee Workers in Florida out of the group’s Campaign for Fair Food, to ensure workers are involved in enforcing, monitoring, and designing programs to protect workers in their workplaces through the food supply chain, relying on partnerships between workers, growers, and retail buyers to raise wages and adhere to workplace standards. Wendy’s main competitors, Burger King, McDonald’s, Subway, Chipotle, and Yum Brands which operates Taco Bell and KFC, all joined the Fair Food Program at least a decade ago. The campaign to pressure Wendy’s to join the program has seen a resurgence as several high-profile cases of what has been called modern day slavery on farms in the US and Mexico have demonstrated the need for corporations to assume responsibility for these abuses within their supply chains. On 2 April, farm workers held a five-mile protest march in Palm Beach, Florida, where Wendy’s billionaire majority shareholder and prolific Trump fundraiser Nelson Peltz owns a beachfront mansion worth over $123m and his asset management firm, Trian Partners, recently acquired an office building for $23m, to demand Wendy’s join the Fair Food Program and end modern slavery in farm fields. “We’ve spent over seven years calling on Wendy’s to join this program that every single one of their competitors has been a part of for a decade, and their response to date has been to refuse to commit to join the program and ignore the voices of farmworkers,” said Cruz Salucio, a farm worker in Florida and staffer with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW). “Farm workers marched with the simple question for Wendy’s. And that question is, ‘can you guarantee there isn’t slavery in your supply chain?’ Unfortunately, because there’s no transparency, we haven’t been able to be sure that is not the case.” Farm workers are planning a rally on 12 May in New York City outside of Trian Partners midtown Manhattan office as part of the Wendy’s Boycott campaign ahead of the company’s annual shareholder meeting. Salucio explained most consumers don’t know where the produce they purchase at supermarkets or used at restaurants is sourced from and what working conditions workers experienced to get food products to their table, citing the Fair Food Program as a solution to change abusive practices in major corporations’ supply chains. “Farmworkers across the country and outside of the Fair Food Program continue to be vulnerable to many abuses including heat stress, physical violence and health and safety risks. Without enforcement and monitoring, these abuses will continue to flourish,” added Salucio. In 2021, a shareholder proposal was filed in support of the Fair Food Program, demanding Wendy’s provide evidence to the extent the company protects human rights within its supply chain, which was passed with over 95% of shareholders voting in favor. Eli Kasargod-Staub, executive director and co-founder of Majority Action, a non-profit shareholder advocacy group, argued Wendy’s response since the proposal passed last year has been inadequate. “They simply failed to respond to a number of very specific things that the proposal calls on them to do and there were even more substantive non-responses when it comes to actually taking responsibility for addressing the risks in their supply chain,” said Kasargod-Staub. “Wendy’s is very much an outlier among its peers in terms of how they engage in this really critical question of human rights risks in the agricultural supply chain, and that has really heightened shareholder concerns.” Ahead of Wendy’s annual shareholder meeting in May shareholders are once again pressuring Wendy’s to join the Fair Food Program. A spokesperson for Wendy’s dismissed criticisms of refusing to join the Fair Food Program. “Wendy’s does not participate in the Fair Food Program because there is no nexus between the program and our supply chain,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “Since 2019, Wendy’s has sourced our North American tomato supply exclusively from indoor, hydroponic greenhouse farms, while the Fair Food Program predominantly operates in outdoor, conventional tomato growing environments. Further, Wendy’s has an established Supplier Code of Conduct that applies to significant suppliers of The Wendy’s Company and our North America restaurant system, and we also require third-party reviews related to the human rights and labor practices for suppliers of certain hand-harvested, whole, fresh produce such as tomatoes.” CIW criticized Wendy’s explanation, citing they could either switch supplies to those used in the Fair Food Program or bring their current supplies into the program. They also criticized Wendy’s audits as voluntary and inadequate due to lack of input from workers and a lack of record of enforcement. “Customs and Border Protection have gone on the record to say social audits don’t work and the Fair Food Program does,” the coalition said in a statement. “Buying preferentially from growers who meet the highest human rights standards is how the program works to end modern-day in the fields, and that’s what the rest of the fast-food industry did when they joined a decade ago: condition purchases on fair food program participation.”",News/Environment,Why Wendy’s is the source of unrest among US farm workers,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/28/us-farm-wendys-fair-food-program
4/28/2022,"The consumer goods firm Unilever has said “unprecedented cost inflation” lies ahead as Russia’s war on Ukraine has added to a surge in energy and ingredient costs, suggesting that shoppers are likely to pay more for well-known brands. The company, which makes goods ranging from Dove soap to Magnum ice-cream and Marmite, said on Thursday it expected its costs to rise by €2.7bn (£2.3bn) in the second half of 2022, after an already steep increase of €2.1bn expected for the first half. The increased costs forecast comes as companies grapple with the inflationary pressures that built as the global economy rapidly recovered from the shock of coronavirus pandemic lockdowns and central banks cut interest rates. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has added to the mix by pushing up energy prices. Unilever has been directly affected by the invasion. The company has been forced to stop all operations in Ukraine and last month suspended all imports and exports of products into and out of Russia as well as all advertising spending in the country. Unilever had initially remained silent on whether it planned to pull out, and has been criticised by Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, for continuing to run operations in Russia. Whitbread, the owner of the Premier Inn hotel chain and some restaurant brands, also on Thursday warned of faster cost increases of between 8% and 9% annually because of the impact of the war in Ukraine on energy and food prices. However, Whitbread also felt confident enough in its prospects to restore its dividend to investors, more than two years after it paused payouts as hotels were forced to close. It said its profits would be partly protected by its “pricing power”, suggesting its executives think they can pass costs on to consumers. Unilever has also passed on higher costs to consumers. It reported underlying sales growth of 7.3% in the first three months of 2022 thanks to steep price increases, even as the volume of sales dropped by 1%. Alan Jope, Unilever’s chief executive, said it was a “very challenging input cost environment” but said it was a “solid quarter of sales growth” led by more expensive beauty products and nutritional supplements. “This performance was delivered against the backdrop of significant rises in input costs that have further accelerated through the first three months of the year, and the human tragedy of the war in Ukraine,” Jope said. Unilever said it would defend its profit margins through pricing among other tactics.",News/Business,"Unprecedented inflation ahead as Russia-Ukraine war adds to costs, says Unilever",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/28/unprecedented-inflation-ahead-as-ukraine-crisis-adds-to-costs-says-unilever

West CorkTrue crime – in both television and podcast form – has a fine line to tread in moral terms, especially when dealing with the brutal and high-profile murder of a woman. But voyeuristicor gratuitous are not adjectives you could ever apply to West Cork, an investigation by British documentarian Jennifer Forde and her journalist husband Sam Bungey into the 1996 killing of French television producer Sophie Toscan du Plantier in a remote part of Ireland. Impeccably researched and scrupulously even-handed, the 13-part series features hours of in-depth interviews with practically everyone involved in the case – including the self-mythologising prime suspect. Mystery ShowNot all investigations are disturbing or dark: this series from This American Life contributor (and, more recently, a writer on offbeat comedy-drama Search Party) Starlee Kine only ran for six episodes in 2015, but its host’s optimism, idiosyncrasy and sterling detective work means it’s become a podcast classic. Shot through with Kine’s distinctive humour, the show takes on a series of amusing conundrums – a disappearing video store; an astonishingly intricate belt buckle found on the street; Jake Gyllenhaal’s seemingly changing height – and actually gets some answers. Really, though, it’s Kine’s ability to connect with the strangers she encounters that makes Mystery Show such a profound, life-affirming joy.

4/28/2022,"Gasoline prices at the pump have surged, reaching a US national average of $4.34 on 21 March, and remain more than 70% greater than at this time last year. At the same time, global supplies of oil have actually increased, including from Russia, even amid the war in Ukraine. So if high prices are not being driven by scarcity, what’s going on? Experts are warning that little-publicized energy traders, most of whom work for the world’s largest oil companies, banks and privately held trading houses, are partly to blame. The amount of trades – and the profits associated with them – have been skyrocketing, reaching record highs in 2021 and 2022. This inadequately regulated activity is hitting Americans’ pockets and represents a “market emergency”, according to Michael Greenberger, a former US government trading regulator. “My instinct tells me that a very careful analysis of this market would show that the price is not reflective of supply chain problems, that there’s just too much leeway for the big banks and the big producers to manipulate if no one is looking and watching what they’re doing,” says Greenberger, the former division director of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the main regulator of US energy markets. “Nobody with power is looking at what they’re doing,” he says. “There’s no cop on the beat.” Veteran oil analyst Philip K Verleger has warned that supply and demand “fundamentals have been rendered almost irrelevant” for oil prices, a key determinant of the price of gasoline at the pump. He has pointed to a dramatic rise in speculation driven by AIs rapidly buying and selling massive energy bets based on minor or even nonexistent changes to real-world supplies. “Under these circumstances, a change in [supply and demand] fundamentals that might have moved prices by 50¢ or $1” will cause a change of as much as $10 a barrel of oil, he has written. Overall, global oil production is nearly 5m more barrels a day greater in 2022 than in 2021, yet US politicians on both sides of the aisle have called for even more drilling. Oil exports from Russia into the global market have not been slowed by either the war or sanctions. Instead, they’re rising and are expected to end April higher than at any time since before the Covid pandemic, according to research firm Kpler. “Crude is getting loaded on vessels and getting shipped. Which I think is the story right now,” Reid L’Anson, senior commodity economist at Kpler, told The Guardian. There are certainly other factors putting upward pressure on prices, including fears that Russian supply could decline in the future. But the price of oil, natural gas, and other vital fossil fuel commodities are today primarily set by energy traders, whose actions are stoking rising prices and volatility. Little physical oil actually changes hands with such trades, which take place on two main exchanges in the US, CME Group and the Intercontinental Exchange. Instead the trade is in futures contracts, a commitment to purchase a set amount of oil in the future for a price agreed in the present. But because the virtual trading has come to dwarf the physical trade, it now determines the price of oil. Greenberger estimates that “something like 13 times the physical amount of oil is traded” via these purely financial contracts. And commercial trades – those based on the actual use of oil – have been pushed out, he says, replaced almost entirely by speculators looking to make a quick buck, which is in turn increasing excessive speculation and volatility. According to data provided to the Guardian by CME Group, the amount of crude oil futures contracts traded daily on its platform rose in 2022 over 2021, and is nearly double that of a decade ago. Rising prices and volatility have been on display since the day before Russian troops went to war against Ukraine, when the price of a barrel of oil was $90. Since the invasion, despite no change in supply, it has vaulted to a $124, fallen to $95, shot back up to $114, before sliding down to $103 a barrel today – over 60% higher than the price one year ago. All the major oil companies, leading US banks, and lesser known private trading houses led by Vitol, Trafigura, Mercuria, and Glencore, are involved in speculative energy trading. Some have even been found guilty of illegal trading over the years. But determining their exact level of involvement is not easy, as there are few reporting requirements allowing the public into this largely opaque world. In a 2020 earnings call with analysts, Shell CEO Ben van Beurden called Shell’s trading “core to the success of our company, it actually makes the magic in many cases”. Shell typically earns as much as $4bn annually from this trading. “We’re seeing just massive volatility, in terms of trading activity, in terms of pricing, where you’ve got big bounces between prices, and so something is wrong,” says Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s Energy Program, a non-profit consumer advocacy organization. Slocum, who also serves on the Energy and Environmental Markets Advisory Committee to the CFTC, calls for greater regulation and transparency into a broken system where “speculators are allowed to reign free”. The CFTC itself was weakened by Trump and crippled by vacancies under Biden, who left the majority of commission seats empty until late last month. Slocum argues that the federal government has ceded too much authority to the futures exchanges. With profits based on volume of trades, they have little incentive to reign in traders, including excessive speculation, he alleges. Asked to respond to these allegations, both CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange declined to comment. There are signs that policymakers are starting to take note. Democratic senators Maria Cantwell and Amy Klobuchar led a commerce committee hearing earlier this month on potential manipulation in petroleum markets. Congressman Ro Khanna told the Guardian that he supports reforms to curb excessive speculation and step up enforcement with an ultimate goal of shifting to renewable energy. Tyson Slocum agrees. Constant volatility and rising oil and natural gas prices at the hands of energy traders bring vast profits for a few, but hardship for most. It’s “a wake up call that we need to aggressively get off of fossil fuels”, he says. “What’s going on in the [futures] markets is actually not constructive or useful for a clean energy transition.”",News/Environment,Why are gas prices so high?
