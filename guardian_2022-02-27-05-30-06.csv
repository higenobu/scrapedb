2/27/2022,"A road worker has died after a car police were chasing crashed into his vehicle on the M6. Staffordshire police said the man who was killed was in his 40s and was the driver and sole occupant of what they described as a “highways vehicle”. It had been stationary and in a cordoned-off roadworks area of the carriageway when the crash happened on Saturday morning. A 27-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and remains in police custody. According to the Staffordshire police, officers had been trying to stop an Audi – which they believed had been involved in an incident within the West Midlands area – shortly after 5am on the M6 northbound between junctions 14 and 15 when the car collided with the Highways vehicle. Police said the man in the stationary vehicle was pronounced dead by paramedics a short time later. His next of kin have been informed and are being supported by specially trained officers. Staffordshire police said the incident has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) owing to the police activity prior to the collision. An IOPC spokesperson said: “We have begun an independent investigation into police actions prior to a fatal traffic collision on the M6 northbound between junction 14 and 15 this morning (Saturday). “An Audi car being pursued by police from the Central Motorway Patrol Group collided with a stationary highways vehicle in a cordoned off roadworks area of the carriageway at 5.14 am. “The occupant in the stationary vehicle sadly died at the scene. Initial police information indicates that the Audi driver had failed to stop for police around 10 minutes earlier. “We were notified of the incident by Staffordshire police and sent investigators to the scene and to the police post-incident procedures this morning to begin our inquiries.” A National Highways spokesperson said: “At National Highways we want everyone to get home safe and well. Tragically this morning this couldn’t happen for one of our road workers who was working on the M6 improvement scheme. Our thoughts remain with their family, friends and colleagues during this difficult time.” Staffordshire police has been contacted for an update.",News/UK news,Road worker dies on M6 following police car chase,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/26/road-worker-dies-on-m6-following-police-car-chase
2/27/2022,"And you shall know us by the trail of sponsors. The League Cup has always been a bird-on-a-wire kind of thing. Every year this fond old springtime ritual is menaced and marginalised and threatened with ever more imminent extinction, but still people keep turning up in February and March asking where the party is. The title branding tells a story of that picaresque progress. In the space of 40 years, English football’s second-string domestic cup has gone from the quiet gravitas of being named after the entire Football League, through Coca-Cola, beer, electrical goods and the generic liquid “milk” into a holding pattern of insurance and financial products and now on to its current iteration as the global face of Thailand’s second-most popular energy drink. And still it marches on, enduringly popular with the people who actually go to watch and a genuinely mouthwatering prospect as Chelsea and Liverpool prepare to meet at Wembley on Sunday afternoon. This time around the headline branding looks spot-on. A perfect fit for a fizzy, colourful, fun kind of day, a little left-field but with its own peppy sense of fun; not to mention, on this occasion, a little caffeinated ignition. Not least for Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool, a great club team still in the process of writing their own story as a great club team, who really could do with winning this one. Liverpool won this competition four years in a row from 1981 to 1984 and, filtered though those grainy, glorious tight-shorted years of triumph, it feels like the touchtone for any great Liverpool winning era. Is this one yet? It is a deliberately provocative question. But there is a kind of disjunction here. Klopp has created a thrillingly well-grooved elite team. But the hard fact remains. Liverpool have won two trophies – the two biggest ones – in the past decade. Should Chelsea win Thomas Tuchel will have lifted as many trophies in his single year in west London as Klopp has in six at Liverpool. This is, of course, an unfair comparison. A Carabao Cup is some way short of a first Premier League title in two decades. Tuchel started with the levels set vertiginously high, with no bar on squad depth and financial resources, whereas Klopp has built an era at Liverpool from a low base, building an entire way of playing, an energy, a sense of connection. But the fact remains Sunday will be his first domestic cup final since defeat by Manchester City in this competition in his first season. This is what Klopp is missing, for all his headline successes; a sense of rolling background glory, the knockout cups, the days out, the annual pageantry of the great winning teams. Klopp stands alongside Pep Guardiola as the greatest Premier League coach of his era when it comes to vibes, uplift, team-building, the energising of an entire club. The next three months will offer the chance to balance the ledger. As things stand Liverpool have a chance to win four trophies this season. That sounds fanciful. It almost certainly won’t happen. And yet … there are a maximum of 23 games remaining in Liverpool’s season: Twenty-three games to win them all. Or at least to get as close as possible. That still sounds like a lot of games. But look back and the past 23 have brought one defeat and 18 wins including the current run of nine in a row. Repeat that run from this point, just keep on keeping on, and they can win all four trophies. It is, of course, not that easy. Sustaining that level over 23 games is normal elite team behaviour. Stretching it to 46 across a run of high stakes do-or-die affairs would be truly rare. Plus, the opposition also have a say. The past 23 games have brought Burnley, Cardiff, Brentford, Norwich, Shrewsbury and Everton. The next 23? Well, here comes everyone. In the way from here are Chelsea, West Ham, Arsenal, Manchester United, Manchester City, Tottenham and, on the final day of the league season, Wolves, plus some combination of Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid, Atlético Madrid, Bayern Munich and Juventus in the Champions League. This is a genuine, high-stakes, brilliantly fun-looking path towards some kind of glory, a moment not to blink or look down. It starts with a Carabao Cup final that could fulfil two complementary needs: a shot of nitroglycerine for the season’s run-in; plus a little glory-padding, some ballast to back up an already distinct and identifiable era. Klopp does have a thing with domestic cups. Mainly, he’s won one of them, the DFB-Pokal 10 years ago with Borussia Dortmund. Tuchel has three. Guardiola has nine. Brendan Rodgers has six. There is no obvious logic to this, other than the fact Klopp has tended to manage teams with more trimmed-back squads. Dortmund had to compete with the superior playing riches of Bayern. Liverpool have been about intense focus, pared-back strengths, a settled first XI. And it is here that promises a fascinating contrast of styles. There is a tendency to lump Tuchel and Klopp together: angular, articulate Germans who trod the same early club football path, a bit of Ralf Rangnick stuff, a sense of pressing, choreographed intensity, tracksuit-clad rage, a hat, ankle-fit tracksuit trousers. In reality, Klopp and Tuchel never met at Mainz or Dortmund. These were genuine successions, one out, one in. They’ve had dinner now and then, met at functions, but are “not super-close”, in Tuchel’s words. And they are quite different in their net tactical effect. Tuchel wants control. Klopp wants to create energy, to overload and overwhelm. Tuchel fixates on certain areas, obsessing over the timing and execution of turnovers in a clearly defined band of space in the opponent’s half. Klopp wants to run you into the ground. Tuchel is a tactical omnivore, varying his method to his resources. Klopp has a system. If you can’t live with it he’ll find someone who can. The key battles will play out on these lines. Liverpool’s strengths are obvious. Chelsea’s task is to shut down Mohamed Salah’s influence, to mitigate a potential mismatch with Marcos Alonso on the left flank. Tuchel must also contemplate once again the fall of Rom. Kai Havertz offers more and is a better footballer, better suited to Tuchel’s system. But Romelu Lukaku is a £90m centre-forward with a goal record light years beyond anyone else in his squad and this final is likely to be decided on very small margins. Whatever the result the beleaguered old League Cup – still a fan’s favourite for what that’s worth (very little) – will struggle on into another year. This is a delicious-looking final. For Klopp, and Liverpool, its effects could be profound.",Sport/Football,Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool are a great team with a need for more trophies | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/26/jurgen-klopps-liverpool-are-a-great-team-with-a-need-for-more-trophies
2/27/2022,"The temptation when Bruno Lage was appointed by Wolves was to assume it would just be more of the same: another Portuguese manager, another Jorge Mendes client, at a club with a strong Portuguese core. If managers from the German school of hard-pressing are the most modish appointment for an aspirational modern club, Portugal’s disciples of Vítor Frade and periodisation are not far behind. While Lage is very much of that school – to the extent that in 2012, despite being a youth coach at Benfica at the time, he co-authored a report with the former Sheffield Wednesday and Swansea coach Carlos Carvalhal on the latter’s implementation of periodisation at Besiktas – this has been a season of change at Wolves. The result is that, even after defeat at Arsenal on Thursday, Wolves go into Sunday’s game at West Ham with four more points than they have had at this stage of a Premier League season. Even if they do not finish in the top four, a club that had seemed to be stagnating have been reenergised and have a good chance of their best finish since coming fifth in 1972-73. Lage’s report on Besiktas, Soccer: Developing a Know-How, starts in the language familiar to anybody acquainted with Frade’s work, rejecting the “reductionism” of Cartesianism and those thinkers who “having an object of study … separate its various components and attempt carefully to study each one with the goal of understanding each component better”. In football, that means separating the game into four basic components: tactical, technical, physical and psychological. “In Tactical Periodisation,” the report explains, “the understanding of the tactical is different – it’s a dimension that assumes the coordination of the whole process involving with it all other dimensions that assume equal importance. It demonstrates itself in a specific form depending on the choice of exercises so to model our style of playing. Basically, speaking of this dimension is to assume as a team culture that brings out a specific style of play, that is, the creation of a dynamic collective identity that has individuals’ intents but related to the collective idea.” It’s little different to the theories José Mourinho used to espouse in the days when he still talked about football and we’ve heard similar from various Frade-inspired coaches. It explains why, when Wolves had a run of eight games in November and December when they scored two goals, Lage was relatively unruffled. For him, it was not as simple as the defence working and the attack being blunt; the whole was good and therefore the goals would come. Yet there had been a sense over the past couple of seasons that periodisation had had its day. It is a long time since Mourinho felt fresh. Nuno Espírito Santo went into decline at Wolves. Marco Silva disappointed at Everton. Carvalhal is at Braga. Leonardo Jardim has just left Al Hilal. Vítor Pereira, after being relegated with 1860 Munich, moved to China and, after being drummed out of Everton before he had been given the job, has just been named manager of Corinthians. Having won Euro 2016 with Portugal, the caution of Fernando Santos looks as though it may be restricting an emerging generation. It is not entirely clear whether André Villas-Boas is a resting football manager or a resting rally driver. But periodisation is a broad church: it describes a general method rather a specific style of play. There is no reason why a basic sense of the interconnectedness of things – which is certainly not unique to the Portuguese school – should necessarily result in the sort of stifling football that managers such as Mourinho, Santos and even Carlos Queiroz tend to produce. Lage spent a long time as an assistant at various smaller Portuguese clubs before eight years in the youth department at Benfica. After a stint in Dubai, he worked as Carvalhal’s assistant at Sheffield Wednesday and Swansea. His experience is broad-based. In his season and a half as head coach at Benfica, his side were notably attacking, averaging 2.38 goals per game. Initially, he seemed to be attempting something similar at Wolves and the story of the early part of their season was of promising performances that didn’t quite produce the results they deserved. Lage instituted a more reactive approach, more akin to how Wolves had played at their best under Nuno. José Sá has proved an upgrade on Rui Patrício, while the emergence of Max Kilman has meant that, even in the absence of Willy Boly, the back three has been solid. Lage, who spent much of his career scouting opponents, had a video analysis room installed and the benefits of that have been seen in the more targeted pressing which yielded both goals against Tottenham (the free-kick that led to the first came from possession being won high) and the goal at Arsenal. Wolves have also become more conservative with the ball. No side in the Premier League crosses less often than Wolves; they had been sixth in that metric last season, albeit it many of them were delivered by Adama Traoré, now on loan at Barcelona. They hold possession better, which increases the importance of Rúben Neves. As Tottenham, having gone 2-0 down, showed in the final hour two weeks ago, if you shut him down you can disrupt Wolves but, more generally, that change has given Wolves more control and should make them less dependent on Raúl Jiménez. Ideally, they need a little more creativity in that front three. Hwang Hee-chan has shown his promise and Pedro Neto is returning after 10 months out with a fractured patella, but Wolves might have hoped for a little more from Daniel Podence or Trincão. Only Burnley and Norwich have scored fewer goals in the Premier League this season, but there is reason to expect that to improve, at least to an extent, without major tactical changes. The dream of a top-four finish probably is now beginning to fade, but that can not reasonably be seen as failure. Wolves have the 14th-highest wage bill in the Premier League; they will comfortably outperform that this season. Lage’s tweaks, his version of periodisation, have led to distinct improvement.",Sport/Football,Bruno Lage finds right connections at Wolves to shrug off Portuguese struggles | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/26/bruno-lage-finds-right-connections-at-wolves-to-shrug-off-portuguese-struggles
2/27/2022,"Manchester City have had more emphatic wins but should they retain their Premier League crown the eventual verdict may be that few were more valuable than this. With 10 minutes to go, stalemate beckoned as Everton looked unbending in their resistance. The momentum seemed to be swinging towards Merseyside, and Liverpool, in the title race. Then Phil Foden pounced on Everton’s one defensive error and City’s lead stretched to six points. Frank Lampard’s season in the City midfield was the coda to 13 years at Chelsea and during a brief managerial career he had already shown a defiance towards former employers. City’s defeat to his Chelsea in June 2020 ended their reign as champions, something the red half of Merseyside savoured. As Everton began hovering perilously above the relegation zone, their obduracy stemmed from necessity. While there were hints of urgency, with Goodison roused when Everton snapped into challenges, they were otherwise content to let City have possession. Everton had numbers behind the ball. Deprived of Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who has a calf injury, Lampard recalled a fit-again Abdoulaye Doucouré to bolster his midfield but his choice of 4-3-3 meant he has started with three formations in his five-match reign. The latest at least promised solidity. Everton began in disciplined fashion, getting bodies around the edge of their area as neither goalkeeper was required for 29 minutes. Then Kevin De Bruyne tried his luck from distance and Jordan Pickford held his shot. Everton’s counterattacks tended to stem from the direct running of Anthony Gordon, who showed the fearlessness to take on City. Perhaps the winger was encouraged by the sight of a makeshift right-back, with John Stones preferred to Kyle Walker. Gordon ended the first half by whipping a free-kick on to the roof of the net, with Ederson relieved it had gone over. The surprise was that when a break on their left resulted in a shot a section of the Everton support thought had gone in, it didn’t come from him. Otherwise occupied by Foden, Jonjoe Kenny surged forwards to meet Allan’s pass and unleash an effort that nestled in the side-netting. A second chance followed in quick succession, Alex Iwobi supplying a first-time pass and Richarlison a snap-shot that Ederson stopped. Pep Guardiola had rearranged his forward line in a quest to find them space. Bernardo Silva had begun as the false nine. Relocated to the right, he cut in and shot but at Pickford. Arguably, however, their first-half impotence stemmed more from De Bruyne and Ilkay Gündogan’s inability to create anything of note as Allan felt the dominant figure in midfield. City began the second half probing for an opening. As they played at a greater pace, they got Silva more involved in the game and he started to embark on meandering but menacing runs infield. When he bent a low pass into the path of the other winger, Foden drilled a shot that Pickford parried. He had looked the brightest of City’s front three before the interval and carried on where he left off. As De Bruyne also spent more time on the right flank, it looked as though City were targeting Kenny. The third member of their right-sided trio looked the least likely to provide the breakthrough and Stones is scarcely renowned for his long-range shooting, but Pickford had to push his 20-yard effort over the bar. As City’s pressure became relentless, Pickford was required to excel. A brilliant double save from De Bruyne and Silva, picking himself off the turf to turn the Portuguese’s follow-up away, presumably impressed the watching Gareth Southgate. Foden inadvertently helped preserve parity, too, heading over when he should have scored from De Bruyne’s cross. Guardiola summoned Gabriel Jesus and Riyad Mahrez and gave Silva a third position of the evening as he dropped into midfield. It proved a case of third time lucky. The Portuguese’s low cross from the left was unconvincing, but Mason Holgate deflected into the path of his central-defensive partner, Michael Keane took a swing at thin air and a predatory Foden poked a shot past Pickford. That was not quite the end of it. The ball bounced up on to Rodri’s arm and, during a VAR review, Richarlison took up residence on the penalty spot, so convinced was he of the forthcoming verdict. Instead, no penalty was awarded, courtesy of an offside in the build-up, and City survived.",Sport/Football,Foden pounces on error to give Manchester City win at Everton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/26/everton-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report
