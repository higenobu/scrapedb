3/15/2022,"Ben Roberts-Smith machine-gunned an Afghan prisoner to death as an “exhibition execution”, a comrade has told the federal court during cross-examination. “He wanted people to see he was going to kill someone out there in front of everyone,” the former SAS soldier, anonymised before court as Person 24, testified during a combative, and at times emotional, second day in the witness box. Roberts-Smith is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over reports he alleges portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies all wrongdoing. Person 24 told the court on Monday that he witnessed Roberts-Smith carry an Afghan man – whom he later discovered had a prosthetic left leg – outside of a village compound being raided by Australian troops. “Mr Roberts-Smith walked out of the compound … at this stage he was holding a man in his hand, it appeared he [the man] had come off the ground, he was being held by his pants or back of the shirt. “He [Roberts-Smith] marched about 15 metres directly out – he dropped the man on to the ground – and immediately put a machine-gun burst into his back.” Person 24 said the machine-gun burst was “eight to 10 rounds” and told the court he said to a comrade standing next to him, “did we just witness an execution?”. The compound, codenamed Whiskey 108, was being “cleared” by Australian SAS troops, in the village of Kakarak, in Afghanistan’s southern Uruzgan province, in the late afternoon of 12 April 2009. Person 24 is the third Australian soldier to give similar – though not identical – evidence they saw an Australian soldier shoot the man with the prosthetic leg outside Whiskey 108, and the second witness to identify Roberts-Smith as the soldier allegedly responsible. He told the court he saw the soldier side-on from a distance of 20 metres, and while he did not see his face, he identified Roberts-Smith by his size, gait and “physical demeanour”. Other soldiers have given evidence they saw a man with a prosthetic leg, who was discovered hiding in a secret tunnel inside the compound, taken into the custody of Australian troops before being “marched off” by Roberts-Smith. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Roberts-Smith does not dispute he shot and killed the man with the prosthetic leg but says the man was legitimately engaged in battle. Roberts-Smith was extensively questioned about the Whiskey 108 mission when he gave evidence in this trial last year: he said he saw the man carrying a weapon and running, and killed him in accordance with troops’ rules of engagement. “He had his hand over the top of the weapon, because he was carrying it down next to his body like that … hunched over, as in, running like that with his shoulders down.” The dead man’s prosthetic leg was souvenired by another soldier and taken back to the Australian base in Tarin Kowt and used as a macabre celebratory drinking vessel at the SAS troops’ unofficial bar, the Fat Ladies Arms. The court has been shown photographs of soldiers drinking from the leg. Roberts-Smith was not pictured drinking from the leg and denies doing so. On Tuesday, Person 24, subpoenaed by the newspapers, was cross-examined over the truth of his evidence, and his motivation for giving it. He told the court, “I’m compelled here to tell the truth”, and that he didn’t believe Roberts-Smith was trying to hide his killing of the man with the prosthetic leg. “I think it was an exhibition execution,” he told the court. “He wanted people to see he was going to kill someone out there in front of everyone.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app Person 24 has told the court he resented being forced to give evidence against Roberts-Smith. On Monday he said he “didn’t agree with the agenda” of a faction within the SAS that sought to destroy Roberts-Smith’s reputation and decorated service record. “I still don’t agree with the fact BRS [Roberts-Smith] is here, under extreme duress, for killing bad dudes we went there to kill.” On Tuesday, he broke down as he was repeatedly questioned about the truth of his evidence. Arthur Moses SC, acting for Roberts-Smith, repeatedly put it to him he had fabricated his evidence and had come to court to “tell a story”. “I am not telling any lies, your honour,” he told the court. “I am not making this up. I don’t want to be here, I’m here because I was subpoenaed. “I find it extremely difficult to stomach that having to give evidence against that man in the corner,” referencing Roberts-Smith, who has watched the trial from the same corner seat every day. Moses again put it to Person 24 that he was lying and had confected his evidence before the court. “You can put whatever you like to me,” Person 24 said. “I’m just giving my evidence, I just saw it happen on the ground. “I know it’s your job to discredit me,” he said to Moses. The court also heard evidence about the alleged “blooding” of a new soldier in the regiment – anonymised before court as Person 4. “‘Blooding’ refers to initiating a person in the practice of killing, or giving them the taste for killing,” the newspapers’ defence states. The newspapers allege and another witness has previously told the court that Person 4, then on his first tour, was ordered to summarily execute a captive elderly Afghan man at Whiskey 108 on the orders of Roberts-Smith. Person 4 gave evidence earlier in this trial, but objected to answering questions about his actions at Whiskey 108 on grounds of self-incrimination. Justice Anthony Besanko did not compel him to answer. Person 24 said Person 4 was a friend, and “a great person”. “And to see how his life has been turned upside down by the time that he spent in the regiment and the people that he spent it with, I find heartbreaking.” Person 24 has said a senior member of the patrol, identified as Person 5, said before the Whiskey 108 mission that they were going to “blood the rookie”. Person 24 said he understood that to mean Person 4 would be put in a position where he would kill somebody.

3/15/2022,"An employee on Russia’s state Channel One television has interrupted the channel’s main news programme with an extraordinary protest against Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor at Channel One, burst on to the set of the live broadcast of the nightly news on Monday evening, shouting: “Stop the war. No to war.” She also held a sign saying: “Don’t believe the propaganda. They’re lying to you here.” It was signed in English: “Russians against the war.” The news anchor continued to read from her teleprompter speaking louder in an attempt to drown out Ovsyannikova, but her protest could be seen and heard for several seconds before the channel switched to a recorded segment. Ovsyannikova also released a pre-recorded video via the OVD-Info human rights group in which she expressed her shame at working for Channel One and spreading “Kremlin propaganda.” “Regrettably, for a number of years, I worked on Channel One and worked on Kremlin propaganda, I am very ashamed of this right now. Ashamed that I was allowed to tell lies from the television screen. Ashamed that I allowed the zombification of the Russian people. We were silent in 2014 when this was just beginning. We did not go out to protest when the Kremlin poisoned [opposition leader Alexei] Navalny,” she said. “We are just silently watching this anti-human regime. And now the whole world has turned away from us and the next 10 generations won’t be able to clean themselves from the shame of this fratricidal war.” Wearing a necklace in the blue and yellow of the Ukrainian flag, Ovsyannikova said in her video statement that her father is Ukrainian and her mother is Russian. “What is happening in Ukraine is a crime and Russia is the aggressor,” she said. “The responsibility of this aggression lies on the shoulders of only one person: Vladimir Putin.” She urged fellow Russians to join anti-war protests in order to bring an end to the conflict. “Only we have the power to stop all this madness. Go to the protests. Don’t be afraid of anything. They can’t imprison us all.” The protest was welcomed by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. In a video address on Monday night he said: “I’m thankful to those Russians who don’t stop trying to deliver the truth, who are fighting against disinformation and tell real facts to their friends and families, and personally to that woman who went in the studio of Channel One with an anti-war poster.” OVD-Info said that Ovsyannikova was arrested shortly after her protest and was being held at the Ostankino television centre. Pavel Chikov, head of of the Agora human rights group, later said Ovsyannikova had been arrested and taken to a Moscow police station. She could face prison time under a newly introduced Russian legislation that criminalised spreading so-called “fake news” about the Russian military. Those found guilty under the law could face up to 15 years in jail. Ovsyannikova could also face legal consequences for encouraging “civil unrest” by telling Russians to protest. In a statement published by the state news agency TASS, Channel One said that “an incident took place with an extraneous woman in shot. An internal check is being carried out.” A law enforcement source told TASS that Ovsyannikova could be charged under legislation banning public acts that aim to “discredit the use of Russia’s armed forces.” Her statement marks the first time that an employee from Russian state media has publicly denounced the war as the country continues its crackdown on anti-war dissent. So strict is the current wave 0f censorship that other news programmes blurred out the message on Ovsyannikova’s sign in their own reports on the incident. Since the start of the war, Russia has launched an unprecedented crackdown on protestors, independent news outlets and foreign social media networks. Nearly 15,000 people, including children and elderly people have been detained for protesting against the war. More than two dozen Russian media outlets have been blocked by the country’s media regulator or have chosen to cease operations. The widely used social media platforms Facebook and Instagram have also been banned. State TV meanwhile, remains the main source of news for many millions of Russians, and closely follows the Kremlin line. Within hours of her protest, more than 40,000 people had so far left comments on Ovsyannikova’s Facebook page, with many praising her for her taking a stand. “You are a hero. Thank you so much,” one comment read. Videos of the incident quickly racked up thousands of views. “Wow, that girl is cool,” tweeted Kira Yarmysh, the spokesperson for the jailed opposition leader, Alexei Navalny. Edgars Rinkēvičs, Latvia’s foreign minister, said on Twitter: “While there are brave people like Maria #Ovsyanikova, a producer at Russia’s Channel 1, protesting against the Russia’s war and propaganda tonight or protesters on the streets #Russia still has a chance for better future.”",News/World news,‘They’re lying to you’: Russian TV employee interrupts news broadcast,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/russian-tv-employee-interrupts-news-broadcast-marina-ovsyannikova
