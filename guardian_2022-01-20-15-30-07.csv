1/20/2022,"The story of a Tongan man washed away by the tsunami and who drifted and swam between islands for more than 24 hours has become one of the first to emerge from the island nation, five days after the disaster cut off communications between it and the rest of the world. Lisala Folau, a retired disabled carpenter, told Tongan radio station Broadcom FM that he swam and floated from his island of Atata via two other uninhabited islands to eventually reach the main island of Tongatapu, a total distance of around 13 kilometres.  A transcript of his Thursday interview was translated and shared by a senior editor at the radio station, George Lavaka, on Facebook. Folau said he had been painting his home on Saturday when he was alerted about the tsunami. “My elder brother and a nephew came to my assistance, this time the wave has gone through our lounge, we moved to another part of the house when a bigger wave, this wave I would estimate was about not less than six metres, [arrived].” “Bear in mind that I am disabled. I can’t walk properly … and when I can, I believe a baby can walk faster than I,” he added. “We hid to the eastern side of the house, the waves were coming from the west so we escaped that wave.” He said they climbed a tree with his niece while his brother ran to seek help. When there was a lull in the waves, they climbed down but just then a larger wave hit. “When the wave break on land just below us, my niece Elisiva and I had nothing to hold onto and we were swept out to sea. This was 7pm,” Folau said. “We floated at sea, just calling out to each other. It was dark and we could not see each other. Very soon I could not her my niece calling anymore but I could hear my son calling.” Folau said that in that moment, he decided not to answer his son, for fear that he would risk his life to save him. “The truth is no son can abandon his father. But for me, as a father I kept my silence for if I answered him he would jump in and try to rescue me. But I understand the tough situation and I thought if the worst comes and it is only me.” Folau said he figured that if he clung to a tree trunk, his family would at least be able to find his body if he died. “I floated and was grounded to the east of the island of Toketoke.” Folau said at one point on Sunday morning he saw a police patrol boat heading to Atata island. “I grabbed a rag and waved but the boat did not see me. It then was returning to Tonga and I waved again but perhaps they did not see me.” He then tried to get to the island of Polo’a, setting off at about 10am and landing at around 6pm on Sunday. “I called and yelled for help but there was no one there. My mind was now on my niece that we were washed away together and now I have survived.” Folau said he then focused on his next move. “I was now strong-minded that I could make it to mui’i Sopu.” Sopu is on the western edge of the capital Nuku’alofa, on the main island of Tongatapu. “I was thinking about my sister at Hofoa who is suffering with diabetes and my youngest daughter [who] has heart problems. All this was racing through my mind.” At around 9pm, Folau said he staggered towards a house in Sopu, eventually arriving at the end of a tar sealed public road and was picked up by a passing vehicle and taken to the driver’s home. The Guardian has not been able to establish what happened to Folau’s son and the niece he was with in Atata. However only three people have been confirmed to have died following the tsunami, none from Atata. Another son, Talivakaola Folau took to Facebook to express his gratitude: “A story I’ll never forget in my life … While talking with family in Tonga my tears continued to fall when I think of my Dad swimming around in the ocean after the tsunami hit … My heart is broken imagining you drinking in the seawater Dad, but you’re a strong-willed man.” The story has gone viral on social media since it was first shared by Tongan journalist Marian Kupu. According to Erika Radewagen, an Olympic level swimming official from the Pacific, Folau’s survival story is impressive. “It is absolutely amazing, given that he was fleeing a catastrophic event, to be under that kind of pressure, mentally and with additional physical pressure of fleeing in the dark.” “Even very experienced swimmers have physical boundaries and set parameters, but it takes a different mindset to take do what he did. It’s not like he fell off a boat, he was escaping an erupting volcano, swept away by tsunami. There are more physical obstacles, such as ash, debris, waves and other factors that would have made his swim a lot more challenging.”",News/World news,‘Absolutely amazing’: Tongan man swept away by tsunami stayed afloat for 24 hours ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/20/tonga-tsunami-man-afloat-24-hours
1/20/2022,"Scott Morrison has abandoned a proposal to allow children to drive forklifts after it was rejected by states and territories and criticised as a dangerous “brain fart” by unions. As reported by Guardian Australia, the prime minister took the idea to Thursday’s national cabinet meeting with state and territory leaders, as part of a package of measures to tackle staff shortages caused by the Omicron wave crippling supply chains.  But the plan was unanimously rejected by the states and territories, the ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, said in a statement. Morrison said on Wednesday that “there are changes that we need to make around the age of forklift drivers, to get quite specific,” to help reduce regulations and increase labour supply. On Thursday, Morrison said that national cabinet had “agreed to proceed no further with the issue of 16-year-old forklift drivers”. “We had a good discussion about that today and it is not something we believe, collectively … we should be pursuing at this time,” he said. States appear to have been blindsided by the proposal, with a spokesperson for Queensland’s minister for industrial relations, Grace Grace, revealing Morrison had not raised it with either the minister or the department. Staff in the office of Victoria’s minister for workplace safety, Ingrid Stitt, were also unable to find evidence of communications from the commonwealth on the issue. Due to the dangers of operating a forklift, in Victoria, NSW and Queensland driving one requires a special “high risk work” licence only available to people 18 and over. Spokespeople for Grace, Stitt and NSW’s minister responsible for workplace safety, Victor Dominello, told Guardian Australia they had no plans to allow minors to drive forklifts. “Forklifts can be extremely dangerous machines to operate and we have no plans to lower the age at which a high risk work licence can be obtained,” Stitt’s spokesperson said. “We take workplace safety seriously and understand that large technical machinery requires highly skilled operators with specialist knowledge and training to operate.” In Victoria alone, since 2019 eight people have been killed at work in incidents involving forklifts and state regulator WorkSafe has accepted 419 claims for injuries caused by the machines. The assistant secretary of the Queensland branch of the CFMEU, Jade Ingham, said the backflip on forklifts came after Morrison had failed on vaccines, rapid antigen tests and support for vulnerable workers. Ingham accused Morrison of wanting to use “child labour to fill the gaps on the frontline”. “What next? A return to children leading pit ponies into coalmines and sweeping chimneys?” he said. “If ever there was any doubt that the Morrison Liberals view workers as nothing more than an expendable commodity to be used and discarded, this desperate brain fart should make clear their utter contempt for workers’ health and safety.” Godfrey Moase, an executive director at the United Workers Union, said the age limit should not be lowered because forklifts were dangerous machines that needed to be treated with respect. He said in his career as an organiser he had been involved with the aftermath of two forklift fatalities. Morrison’s proposal “reflects an idea that workers should be kind of seen and not heard” and that “we need to lower protections,” he said. “[But] it’s those health and safety [laws] that have got us through and will get us through if we start treating people with proper respect and dignity in the workplace.” Federal Labor’s industrial relations spokesperson, Tony Burke, described the idea as a “ridiculous proposal” and a “dangerous thought bubble from a desperate prime minister who has run out of ideas”. He said warehouse and distribution workers who had put in long hours and worked in insecure conditions were “heroes of this pandemic”. “They should be rewarded with secure jobs, not dangerous workplaces,” Burke said. Online, the proposal was met with both horror and hilarity. Tim Lyons, a former union official who conducted a review for the Queensland government that resulted in it introducing industrial manslaughter laws in 2017, said that “letting kids whizz around on forklifts is insane”. “They are not dodgem cars,” he said in a Twitter post. “The kids are very likely to kill or injure themselves or someone else.” I worked in warehouses at Uni. Had a forklift licence. I organized in warehouses for more than a decade. Letting kids whizz around on forklifts is insane. They are not dodgem cars. The kids are very likely to kill or injure themselves or someone else. pic.twitter.com/bU6ZKwTM8s Shirley Jackson, of left-of-centre thinktank Per Capita, said he was “baffled” by the announcement. As a former warehouse worker, I am truely baffled by Morrison’s forklift announcement. I’ve know adults who were dangerous behind the wheel of a forkie, let alone young people.Makes me wonder what they’re trying to distract us from, with this ridiculous announcement. Satirists and cartoonists complained that the announcement rendered their crafts superfluous, with satirical website the Chaser choosing to reprint Guardian Australia’s original post on the idea rather than attempt a joke.

1/20/2022,"Back in 1856, the American naturalist Henry David Thoreau remarked of snowflakes: “How full of the creative genius is the air in which these are generated! I should hardly admire more if real stars fell and lodged on my coat.” The six-sided snowflakes described by Thoreau are one of the many shapes that snowflakes can take on, and now a citizen science project called Snowflake ID is using people’s powers of observation to help train a specially designed camera to classify the different types of snowflake that fall.  The aim of the project, run by Tim Garrett and his colleagues at the University of Utah, is not just to catalogue snowflakes, but to use this information to improve weather forecasts. For example, if forecasters know that clouds are amassing small hail-like pellets called graupel, then they can expect a faster accumulation of snow on the ground than if fluffy clusters of traditional snowflakes are gathering. Such information helps to inform decisions about which roads need to be cleared, or where the avalanche risk is high. Meanwhile, studying the shape, size and density of snowflakes falling to the ground provides information about the type of cloud cover above, enabling scientists to monitor our changing climate.",News/World news,How classifying snowflakes could help forecast weather,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/20/how-classifying-snowflakes-could-help-forecast-weather
1/20/2022,"If the world of Call of Duty seems fraught enough when you are playing it, try being in it. That could be the consequence of Microsoft’s proposed $68.7bn (£50.4bn) acquisition of Activision Blizzard, the video games maker behind the shoot ’em up franchise. Announcing the deal, Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, said that gaming would “play a key role in the development of metaverse platforms”. The metaverse is a catch-all term for an immersive experience that blends the physical and digital worlds through a mixture of virtual and augmented reality. This concept is years away from being fully realised, but it is envisaged that participants – using digital representations of themselves, or avatars – will access it through a virtual reality headset, or augmented reality (AR) glasses that put a digital layer over what they see in the real world. In the metaverse they can socialise with friends, carry out their job – or take part in a video game.  John Egan, chief executive of market intelligence firm L’Atelier BNP Paribas, says that with the Activision deal Microsoft has made it “very clear” that gaming will be at the centre of how metaverse concepts work. And it is not just using the games, but also deploying the creative and technical talent behind them to build virtual worlds. “Imagine Call of Duty. You’d be dropped into a Battle Royale-like environment, on to a planet like the way Fortnite is now, though bigger by a factor of several thousand. You’ve got an entire planet, so your experience can go on for weeks at a time.” Egan adds that Call of Duty would work in what he calls a “digi-physical” environment, where AR comes in to play and the game is superimposed on participants’ glasses, or even contact lenses. “Microsoft could create virtual layers over existing urban infrastructure, within which people can use mixed reality lenses, like glasses or contact lenses, to interact with each other. So imagine something like a skateboard park that becomes a Call of Duty arena. And people use their phones as a gun, and they’ve got their glassware on as the mixed reality infrastructure to do that interaction.” Of course, not every metaverse world will be like Call of Duty – and not everyone would want to go anywhere near it. Egan says Activision games such as Crash Bandicoot, featuring the antics of an anthropomorphic marsupial, offer a more family-friendly alternative. Analysts have also pointed to the fact that Activision will immediately bolster Microsoft’s gaming business – it owns the Xbox platform and the Minecraft and Halo franchises – regardless of its metaverse plans. The Bill Gates-founded company will gain access to 390 million monthly users, adding to its Game Pass subscription service, which already has 25 million users. Dan Ives, a managing director at the US investment firm Wedbush Securities, describes Microsoft’s metaverse vision for the deal as “the cherry on top of the sundae”. “We believe for Microsoft this was the right deal at the right time to boost its gaming strategy and streaming ambitions. Nadella recognised Microsoft’s consumer business needed a shot in the arm,” he says. The agreed deal would also need to get past US regulators, who served notice on Tuesday that the tech industry would face a tougher regime. Lina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission, the US competition watchdog, and Jonathan Kanter, head of antitrust at the department of justice, announced a review of merger guidelines – with tech among their areas of concern. Kanter said: “We need to understand why so many industries have too few competitors.” It could be argued that this is a “vertical” deal between two businesses that do not compete directly: Microsoft’s Xbox platform and Activision’s games. But regulators are likely to look at whether Microsoft could shut off Activision titles from rival platforms such as PlayStation. Microsoft said on Tuesday it did not intend to “pull communities away” from PlayStation. Rebecca Allensworth, professor of law at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, says Khan and Kanter’s review signals a toughening of the environment for tech. “Generally, there is a lot of muscle right now behind antitrust enforcement in tech,” she says. “Changing the merger guidelines to be harsher against tech mergers is a part of that. The comments on Tuesday highlighted the idea that the guidelines need to be able to recognise competitive harm from mergers that are vertical or mixed vertical. That’s the merger between Activision and Microsoft.” Nonetheless, she says that it is “still very hard to challenge vertical mergers” and the deal may go through. However, L’Atelier’s Egan added that even if the deal got past the FTC and justice department, there was also the question of integration. On Monday Activision said it had fired or pushed out more than three dozen employees and disciplined another 40 since July, to address allegations of sexual harassment and other misconduct at the company, which has nearly 10,000 employees to Microsoft’s 190,000. “Microsoft has an extraordinarily high level of employee satisfaction,” says Egan. “It’s a really good company. You wonder if one of the biggest threats of this is Microsoft kind of letting the wolf in the door. How are Microsoft going to assimilate an organisation with a culture that is beset by issues to do with misogyny, diversity and harassment over the last number of years which they have failed utterly to remedy? How are Microsoft going to resolve that?” Should the deal go through, Microsoft will have real-world concerns too.",News/Technology,Microsoft’s Activision merger faces real-world barriers to metaverse mission,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/20/microsofts-activision-merger-faces-real-world-barriers-to-metaverse-mission
1/20/2022,"Christian Wakeford said he was elected as a centrist and remains a centrist after his defection to the Labour party, amid calls in his Bury South constituency for a byelection. Wakeford, who supported a backbench bill in 2020 that called for any MP who switches parties to face a recall petition, said it’s “quite clear” his former party would lose the seat at a byelection.  “I think it was quite clear that even the prime minister wasn’t calling for a byelection today, and I think it’s been quite clear that they know they’d lose”, he told broadcasters. However, in Prestwich town centre, voters from across the political spectrum would like to see that belief tested at the polls, a view also endorsed by Jamie Driscoll, Labour’s mayor in the North of Tyne. In a letter to Boris Johnson released on Wednesday afternoon, Wakeford said he believed “the policies of the Conservative government that you lead are doing nothing to help the people of my constituency and indeed are only making the struggles they face on a daily basis worse”. Sham Raja, chair of North Manchester’s Conservative Association, said he had been watching PMQs when Wakeford crossed the floor to sit with Keir Starmer’s party. The MP, elected in 2019, made his shock announcement just minutes before. Raja found the defection “completely disgraceful”, calling for a byelection to see if Wakeford would still win under a “Labour banner”. “We won several seats in Greater Manchester because of Boris Johnson, because of Brexit and because of the Conservative party, and they should be grateful.” Pamela McArdle, 73, who has voted Conservative for decades but had not had a local Tory MP since 1997, said she was “cross” with Wakeford, who said that the prime minister “is running out of road and he is running out of brass neck to hide behind”. “Boris Johnson is one person,” McArdle added. “You don’t walk away because you disagree with them.” Rachel Hopkins, who normally supports Labour, echoed calls for a byelection. “It would be a better outcome than somebody changing colours in such an extreme way. If he was going to the Lib Dems, it would be a bit more credible, but going from Tory to Labour feels a bit ridiculous. I don’t really buy it”. Molly Griffiths, a 29-year-old staff nurse, welcomed the news as she enjoyed a pint in the sun. “I’m very Labour, so it’s good news. But it’s not a good look in the way that one day he wanted the vote of no confidence for Conservatives and then the next he changed to Labour. Is he still going to hold the same Conservative views?” Wakeford referenced issues such as free school meals, cuts to universal credit and the cost-of-living crisis, as well as scandals related Dominic Cummings and Owen Paterson, that had led to his decision. The MP, who worked in the insurance industry and as a local councillor before his election, said the decision had taken “a lot of soul searching” after “many sleepless nights”. “This is something that has taken many months to come to and it’s not been an easy decision, if anything it’s been the most difficult decision I have ever had to make. But I do think it’s the right decision for me, I think it’s the right decision for Bury South.” Claire Richards, 35, who said Wakeford had helped her with a problem, agreed it was a good move for the area. “I’d vote for him whatever. He seemed a good guy”. Although greeted with cheers from the Labour benches in Westminster, and a “warm welcome” from Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham, a local Labour party source said the news had not “gone down well with local members. None of them voted for him to be the MP, so it will be hard to now embrace him as one of our own. This might be positive news nationally but locally it is not going to end well.” “He was worried about his P45, wasn’t he?”, said Lol Grant, 51, in reference to Wakeford’s wafer-thin majority of 402 votes. Grant, who works with children with special educational needs, was particularly aggrieved after Wakeford voted against placing a legal duty on water companies not to pump sewage into rivers. “Now he’s behaving like that shit that he voted to allow flow in our pipes and he’s flowing out from one side of the chamber to the other.”",News/UK news,‘It feels a bit ridiculous’: Bury South on Christian Wakeford’s defection to Labour,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/20/it-feels-a-bit-ridiculous-bury-south-on-christian-wakefords-defection-to-labour
1/20/2022,"Schools are using “misleading and biased” information materials funded by the alcohol industry to educate pupils as young as nine about drinking, according to a study. Teachers in thousands of UK schools employ lesson plans, factsheets and films produced by bodies with close ties to the drinks trade even though they “portray alcohol as a normal consumer product to impressionable young minds”, the researchers found.  The materials are intended to deter young people from underage drinking, but they are potentially harmful because they downplay the harms drink can cause and seek to “blame-shift” responsibility for problems from manufacturers on to young people, the researchers say. Academics from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine analysed teaching materials about alcohol and its health impact put together for use in schools by three bodies: Drinkaware for Education, Smashed and Talk About Alcohol. “Alcohol industry-sponsored youth education programmes serve industry interests and promote moderate consumption while purportedly educating children about harms and influences of alcohol use,” concluded the authors, who included Dr May van Schalkwyk and Prof Mark Petticrew. “The ongoing exposure of children and young people to such conflicted and misleading materials needs urgent attention from policymakers, practitioners, teachers and parents, and resources dependent on industry support should cease being used in schools,” they added. The academics’ findings, which have been published in the medical journal PLOS ONE, are based on their analysis of materials produced by the three bodies – including worksheets, teachers’ guidance notes and PowerPoint presentations – between 2017 and 2019. They conclude: “All programmes promoted familiarisation and normalisation of alcohol as a ‘normal’ adult consumer product, which children must learn about and master how to use responsibly when older.” The materials also “employ selective presentation of harms, including misinformation about cancer.” Some misleadingly imply that only heavy or excessive drinking raises the risk of the disease, whereas research shows low levels of drinking also increases the risk of some types such as breast and mouth cancer, they say. Drinkaware for Education is an educational initiative run by the organisation Drinkaware, an industry-funded body that “aims to change the UK’s drinking habits for the better”. It produces a range of “curriculum-linked education resources aimed at teaching nine- to 14-year-olds about the harms and risks associated with alcohol” that are aimed at teachers. Smashed is a theatre-based educational programme that aims to educate school pupils about underage drinking and also supplies materials for teachers. Since 2005 it has been sponsored by Diageo, the drinks firm that makes Guinness, Smirnoff and other brands. Diageo’s website states that “Smashed Online will be made available to over 1 million students aged 12-14 across 5,500 schools in the UK”. Talk About Alcohol, which produced a teacher manual and lesson plans, is a programme run by the Alcohol Education Trust, a charity that says it “supports young people aged 11-25 in making more informed life choices through the 4,500 schools and youth organisations we support”. The Alcohol Education Trust’s donors include bodies funded by the alcohol industry, but also the national lottery and police and crime commissioners. Van Schalkwyk and Petticrew highlighted a slide in a PowerPoint presentation produced by Drinkaware for secondary schools containing the words “drinking alcohol makes you happy” beside an image of young people drinking wine as an example of “normalisation”. “The materials we analysed contribute to the alcohol industry narrative that it is people’s poor choices and a lack of control or responsibility as well as peer pressure that are to be understood as the problem, shifting blame on to individuals, in this case children and young people, and away from the inherent harmful nature of alcohol itself,” they said. Drinkaware has removed the materials analysed by the researchers from its website. A spokesperson said: “The materials included in this research are out of date and don’t reflect our current guidance. They should have been removed from our website and they now have been. We’re sorry this didn’t happen sooner.” Helena Conibear, the Alcohol Education Trust’s chief executive, accused the authors of “gross misrepresentation” and including “assertion”, “polemic” and selective quotation in their findings. “We hope our programme has played no small part in the very encouraging falls in underage drinking, drunkenness and hospital admissions over the last decade,” said Conibear. Research by University College London and the National Foundation for Education Research showed that Talk About Alcohol delays the age at which children start drinking, and it had won awards from Teach First and The King’s Fund, she added. A Diageo spokesperson said: “Since the Smashed project launched in the UK over 15 years ago, thousands of young people have explored the dangers and consequences of alcohol misuse through the programme, without reference to any specific kinds of alcohol or brands. Underage drinking has been falling in the UK over the last decade.” It stressed that studies had found that about four in five 16- to 24-year-olds in the UK either do not drink at all or stick to the chief medical officer’s guidelines on maximum consumption, and that the proportion of young people who are teetotal has risen to 23%.",News/Society,UK pupils taught about alcohol with ‘misleading’ industry-funded resources,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/20/uk-pupils-taught-about-alcohol-with-misleading-industry-funded-resources
1/20/2022,"Tens of thousands of students in England are studying for degrees at institutions that could soon be punished for low quality and poor value for money, under plans drawn up by the higher education regulator. The Office for Students (OfS) has published a consultation detailing its minimum acceptable outcomes for students, which sets thresholds for drop-out rates, course completion and graduate employment that universities and colleges will have to pass to avoid further investigation.  The consultation document from the OfS says that more than 60,000 students on full-time undergraduate courses are currently or recently enrolled at institutions in England that could fail to meet its minimum standards, as have more than 150,000 part-time undergraduates. The new regulations would mean that universities, colleges and other providers are likely to be sanctioned if fewer than 80% of students studying full-time for their first degree continue past their first year, or if fewer than 75% complete their degree, over the previous four years. Institutions could also be investigated and penalised by the OfS if fewer than 60% of their graduates go on to work in what it classifies as skilled employment. Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the OfS, said the proposals were “a landmark moment” in efforts to tackle poor quality provision in English higher education. “Many universities and colleges in England run high quality courses that deliver positive outcomes for students. The thresholds that we have proposed will not affect them. They are instead designed to target those poor quality courses and outcomes which are letting students down and don’t reflect students’ ambition and effort,” Dandridge said. The new regulations would also create a series of thresholds for part-time and some postgraduate students. The proposed thresholds are unlikely to trouble most mainstream universities in England, although some subjects such as agriculture could attract the OfS’s attention. Private or alternative providers outside the traditional university sector are most at risk of sanction, with some having high drop-out rates and low numbers of students completing their degrees. Sanctions available to the OfS include fines and restrictions on student loan eligibility for institutions that fall below any of the thresholds, including by individual subjects. The OfS said it would look closely at each case, including the use of disaggregated data by sex, ethnicity, previous eligibility for free school meals and other indicators that could influence an institution’s performance. The OfS is also proposing to resuscitate the teaching excellence framework (Tef) awards, which would be compulsory for universities and colleges that meet the thresholds. Ratings of gold, silver or bronze would be awarded by an expert panel appointed by the OfS, using “evidence submitted by universities and colleges, numerical indicators and submissions from students”. But taking a leaf out of the school inspectorate Ofsted, the Tef panel could also award a new “requires improvement” category for universities and colleges “where the panel is unable to identify excellence”. Michelle Donelan, the universities minister for England, said: “Our university system is acclaimed as world class, but there are too many pockets of poor quality. “Through this tough regulatory action, we are protecting students from being let down by these institutions, while also ensuring those delivering outstanding teaching are properly recognised.” Universities UK, representing vice-chancellors and principals, said: “Universities should also consider how courses contribute to public services such as the NHS, to business creation and skills needs in local areas, and their contribution to cultural activity and the environment. “We look forward to continuing to work closely with the OfS as we consider this consultation and the proposals.”",News/Education,OfS publishes plans to punish English universities for poor value for money,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/20/ofs-publishes-plans-to-punish-english-universities-for-poor-value-for-money
1/20/2022,"Research into the gene editing of plants in the UK will become much easier with new rules brought forward by the government that will encourage field trials and other development efforts. Ministers said cutting red tape on gene editing research would help to develop new strains of crops that need less pesticide, have less environmental impact and provide better nutrition. The new rules, introduced in the form of a statutory instrument laid in parliament on Thursday, will apply only to research, rather than allowing gene-edited crops into widespread cultivation or consumption.  It is part of a gradual approach towards gene editing by the government, after public consultation last year. The preferred direction of travel is clear, however, with ministers having repeatedly voiced support for gene editing and genetic modification as aids to modernising farming. Jo Churchill, the minister for agri-innovation and climate adaptation, said: “New genetic technologies could help us tackle some of the biggest challenges of our age, around food security, climate change and biodiversity loss. Now we have the freedom and opportunity to foster innovation, to improve the environment, and help us grow plants that are stronger and more resilient to climate change.” Field trials will still require notification to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and any future crops or foods would be subject to separate authorisation requirements, as at present. The new rules apply only to gene editing, the process of working on a plant’s existing genome, to speed up what could be achieved through natural selection, rather than genetic modification, which can include importing genes from other species. The government cited sugar beet that is resistant to common viruses, wheat strains that contain less of a possible carcinogen and are adapted to the climate crisis, and tomatoes resistant to mildew, as promising areas of research for UK scientists. Campaigners have expressed concern that the government’s moves over the past year, since Brexit made it possible for the UK to ditch some of the EU’s strict rules on GM, may be the prelude to much greater use of gene editing and GM. Pat Thomas, the director of Beyond GM, a pressure group, said: “Today’s announcement is a sop to the biotech research establishment that doesn’t really address the most significant hurdles that developers need to face, which are that farmers don’t really want to grow genetically engineered crops and citizens don’t want to eat them.” She added: “There’s a lot of techno-optimism about what kind of gene-edited foods might materialise one day. But none of the crops Defra is talking about is close to coming to market. After 35 years of use, genetically engineered crops have not delivered much in terms of real value and they have largely been a distraction from more meaningful discussions about what kind of food system we want and need to transition to.” Scientists welcomed the rule changes. Prof Nick Talbot, the executive director of the Sainsbury Laboratory, in Norwich, said: “We can achieve the outcomes of plant breeding – which has been so successful in controlling diseases and improving yields – but in a much more precise manner … to produce nutritious crops requiring much lower fertiliser inputs and with greater resilience. We need innovation to help us escape from the chemical treadmill of current agriculture. In the face of the climate emergency, doing nothing is no longer an option.”",News/Science,UK moves closer to allowing gene editing of crops by allowing more research,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/20/uk-moves-closer-to-allowing-gene-editing-of-crops-by-allowing-more-research
1/20/2022,"In her first press conference of the year, held outside in the central North Island sun, prime minister Jacinda Ardern was almost drowned out by a wave of cicada calls. The clamour is synonymous with New Zealand summertime, a reminder that the country had managed to snatch a long, hot, largely unrestricted holiday season from the mouth of a late-2021 Delta outbreak.  But as New Zealanders trickle back from vacation to their homes and workplaces, they do so with the knowledge that respite will probably be fleeting. “Omicron is knocking at our door now,” Ardern told reporters over the buzz. “We won’t stop Omicron, but we can try and slow it down.” At least three cases of the new variant have been confirmed among border workers and their contacts in Auckland, and there are fears it made have already spread into the wider community. For now, New Zealand is one of a very small handful of countries keeping Omicron at bay. That path is an increasingly lonely one – very few medium-sized economies have stayed dedicated to Covid-zero or heavy-duty suppression. China, the notable exception, faces increasing questions over how sustainable its elimination strategy is. While Beijing remains fiercely committed to that path, however, New Zealand’s leader is now resigned to battle Omicron, describing its transmission across the country as a matter of “when, not if”. “Omicron is in every corner of the world at the moment. And we also know that there will be other variants. And we know that we will experience in New Zealand cases at a level that we haven’t experienced before,” Ardern said. In the meantime, the country will turn to its tried and tested strategy: delay. This has been a central tactic to New Zealand’s Covid game plan. The country had some advantages from the first days of the pandemic: physical isolation and distance bought it time to observe the damage inflicted on overseas health systems, and to respond by closing its borders and moving to wipe out the disease in-country. Over and over again, Ardern’s government chose to sustain that initial advantage – opting for conservatism in the face of Covid, watching other countries’ trajectories, buying time to build vaccination rates. Epidemiologist and public health prof Michael Baker says New Zealand’s “strategic advantage is that we can delay the inevitable.” “The turn of phrase ‘delaying the inevitable’ [makes it sound] as though: why bother? But I would say delaying the inevitable is an extremely good idea with Covid-19,” he says. In the face of the highly-transmissible variant, however, questions linger about what New Zealand’s future will look like when widespread infections finally arrive - and whether it has used its hard-won time to adequately prepare for the coming wave. While vaccination rates are high – about 94% of the adult population is now double-vaccinated and children aged 5-12 this month began receiving their jabs this month – the country’s health system is small and vulnerable to overwhelm, especially outside major cities. A government report on preparedness for Omicron, leaked to Māori Television this week, highlighted concerns that intensive care beds were severely limited, with just one-third, or 108 ICU beds currently free. In several of the country’s 20 district health boards, there was no ICU care available. Even if initial evidence holds and Omicron is a ‘milder’ variant, the speed at which it spreads could still quickly overwhelm New Zealand’s health system, Baker said. “As everyone points out, even a small proportion of a big number is still a big number,” he says. While Ardern has said that an outbreak Omicron would not trigger a lockdown, Baker says they may be necessary to tamp down widespread transmission. “That’s really the essence of mitigation and flattening the peak – is to say well, for all countries, their ability to look after very sick people is always going to be limited.” Epidemiologist Dr Jennifer Summers said via Science Media Centre that there were “concerning gaps in New Zealand’s preparation for delaying and managing an Omicron outbreak” and Ardern ruling out lockdowns was “worrying”. “The health system will be under further immense pressure once Omicron enters the community ... ruling out potential public health measures that could be used to minimise the impact of Omicron is short-sighted,” she said. From the opposition, the government has faced criticism that it has squandered its window of opportunity by failing to roll out widespread access to rapid testing, make large-enough increases to hospital capacity, or outline clear plans for mask use or ventilation in schools or workplaces. In the face of Omicron, opposition leader Christopher Luxon said, the government was “embarking on a second year of Covid complacency: a lack of urgency, a lack of a plan, and making things up as they go”. Even as the country fights to buy itself a few more weeks, its remaining Omicron-free days may be limited. Soon, delay won’t be available as a tactic, Baker said, “given how rapidly Omicron will arrive and spread. That’s if it’s not spreading already - which it could be.”",News/World news,"As Omicron rages around the world, Ardern deploys an old tactic - delay",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/20/as-omicron-rages-around-the-world-ardern-deploys-an-old-tactic-delay
1/20/2022,"The national aged care regulator has intervened in a south-west Sydney nursing home at the centre of a Covid outbreak after finding it failed to meet quality standards relating to infection control and effective management of the outbreak. On 6 January, Guardian Australia reported on a major outbreak at the Bupa Clemton Park facility that saw more than 60 residents and staff become infected with Covid-19, and one fully vaccinated person in palliative care die.  After the report the aged care quality and safety commission formally intervened, ordering the facility to stop new admissions for six months for failing to meet compliance standards of the Aged Care Act. The facility has also been ordered to appoint interim nursing management. A letter provided to Guardian Australia and distributed to friends and relatives of residents on Wednesday confirmed regulatory action had been taken on 11 January in relation to the ongoing outbreak at the facility. “Bupa Clemton Park will not receive payment from the Australian government for new consumers until 11 July 2022,” the letter from national director of aged care compliance, Elsy Brammesan said. “Limiting the number of consumers who can be accepted by the service helps them focus on fixing the problems for current consumers. “The ongoing operation of Bupa Clemton Park continues to be the responsibility of Bupa Aged Care Australia Pty Ltd, and the above action is not expected to change that arrangement. “The commission will continue to visit the service to monitor their progress in fixing the issues against the quality standards.” Dimitrios Kapeleris’s father is a resident of Bupa Clemton Park who acquired Covid-19 early in the outbreak. While his father was asymptomatic during his infectious period, Kapeleris said he had since stopped eating and was highly agitated after a month confined to his room. “It’s concerning that they still haven’t got things right this late into the outbreak,” Kapeleris said. “Given 52 residents have been infected and upwards of 40 staff – wearing full PPE – there’s something amiss in infection control procedures, there’s something seriously wrong.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Asked whether Kapeleris felt more comfortable with his father being housed at the nursing home now the commission has intervened, he said simply “no”. “It raises questions,” he said. “Why have they intervened? What aren’t they doing properly and why aren’t they doing it properly? We don’t have that information yet. “It’s disheartening, it’s heartbreaking, it’s demoralising for us to watch our parents and knowing this is indefinite for them.” Kapeleris previously warned staff about taking adequate precautions in relation to air filtration and ventilation, which were agreed to a week after Guardian Australia’s article was published. “They finally got the filters to ensure clean indoor air but it took a lot of effort on my part to get them to move,” he said. “I was just surprised they weren’t doing this of their own accord.” Kapeleris said while communication also improved later in the outbreak, Covid-19 updates still missed “basic details, such as only reporting active cases not total cases, and not providing specific breakdowns of where cases were occurring. “I don’t know in my dad’s section how many cases they have now,” Kapeleris said. “I ask for that information and still don’t get it.” According to the latest update, about 26 residents had tested positive in his father’s section of 36 people. Overall, 51 residents had been infected with the virus, as well as 44 staff. There were eight Covid-positive residents remaining in the facility with no active infections among employees. “It makes you think ‘why are they holding on to this information?’,” he said. “If they don’t have a handle on what they’re doing wrong and they’re not doing enough to address it, there’s no end in sight.” A Bupa spokesperson said they were “disappointed” by the decision but the facility was cooperating with the commission to manage the outbreak. The spokesperson said an external nurse adviser had been brought in to assist the facility for the next six months to address the commission’s concerns, and further education and training were required among all staff. In addition, the nursing home is required to participate in regular teleconferences and provide reports to the commission as part of progress monitoring towards compliance and ending of the Covid-19 outbreak. “Dealing with the pandemic over the past 21 months has created extraordinary difficulty and worry for our residents, their families, and our employees. We apologise to them for the additional distress this will cause,” the spokesperson said. “We’re closely examining how the commission reached its decision. “We’ll also work closely with the commission to understand how we can once again reach full compliance at Bupa Clemton Park, which is what our residents and their families rightly expect and deserve.” Four weeks into isolating, Kapeleris said he would just be grateful for his father to be able to leave his room. “To go to the outdoor terrace … my dad used to go out there with his friend and tend to the plants, and water them,” he said. “Visiting will be great, but the first step is to get them into the fresh air, to interact with other residents. I’m worried about my dad … they’ve put him on liquid supplements. He’s lost three kilos in a week and a half.”",News/Australia news,"‘It’s heartbreaking, it’s demoralising’: regulator intervenes at Sydney aged care home over Covid infections ",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/20/its-heartbreaking-its-demoralising-regulator-intervenes-at-sydney-aged-care-home-over-covid-infections
1/20/2022,"The steep way up the former incline railway, on the north side of Kit Hill, is edged with yellow gorse, stunted trees and lumps of granite, shrouded in emerald moss and polypody ferns. Near the top of the hill, which dominates the valley, discarded blocks lie where they have been tipped downslope. The derelict quarry closed in 1955 after providing finished granite for parapets, embankments, lighthouses and monuments. At its busiest, between the two world wars, almost 100 men worked there, blasting, cutting, shaping, polishing and loading up stones for lowering towards the junction with the single track railway, which then curved towards Gunnislake and the viaduct at Calstock to link with the upcountry network. Granite ledges, crevices and wet hollows now host lichens, mosses, ferns, cotoneaster shrubs and willow, with pondweed in the standing water.  On this gloomy Sunday, two hardy swimmers emerge from the deep, black water below the sheer quarry face – 20 minutes immersion in a temperature of 6C (according to the swimmers). Other visitors to this popular country park walk briskly with their dogs, or more slowly with children, following signed tracks or standing a while, peering at the expanse of dingy landscape across the Inny Valley and into Devon, on the other side of the meandering Tamar. Patches of wan brightness shine out, briefly lighting new houses on the edge of distant Launceston, and emphasising the unseasonally lush greens of nearer stock-free pastures on the Duchy College farm. Narrow paths, strewn with rotting oak leaves, lead down the sheltered side of the hill, wending across wet and uneven ground where turf, brambles, whortleberry and swathes of brown bracken disguise the splitting pits where moorstone was broken up by hand, and early stream-works for tin ore. A jumble of overgrown clitter (rough stone) helps to protect the maturing woodland of thorn, oak, ash, rowan and holly; perhaps cuckoos and warblers will return in the spring. On the edge of the open land, beside the former track bed of the railway that terminated at Kelly Bray, the elusive sun reappears, peeping above the summit of the shadowy hillside, once the workplace of miners and quarry workers.
