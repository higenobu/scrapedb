2/12/2022,"In Australia, a federal scheme introduced at the end of January allows pensioners and concession card holders to access up to 10 free rapid antigen tests over three months through their chemist. But the scheme got off to a difficult start, with supply issues hampering attempts to procure the tests. In January the competition regulator raised concerns that rapid antigen tests often cost between A$20 and A$30 (£15-£20) per test and sometimes more than A$70 a test through smaller retail outlets, despite wholesale costs ranging from A$3.95 to A$11.45. In Belgium the price of an antigen self-test sold in pharmacies is around €6-€8 (£5-£7), more expensive than in neighbouring countries, such as France and the Netherlands, although they are available in Belgian supermarkets for about €3. Prices have come down and are expected to fall further: one big pharmacy chain announced this week they had begun selling tests for €1.99. While a PCR test, which costs about €41, is free for people with symptoms, or may be reimbursed by health insurance, self-tests usually have to be funded by individuals. The Belgian consumer association Test-Achats/Test Aankoop estimated this week that a family of four could spend €250 a month on Covid tests, hand sanitiser and face masks.  Self-administered tests in France cost between €4 and €5 in pharmacies and about €1.25 in supermarket multipacks. Lateral flow tests and PCR tests administered in pharmacies, laboratories and testing centres (both of which give you a result with a QR code allowing you to travel, for example) are free for all who are registered with the French healthcare system and fully vaccinated. People who are not in the system (tourists, for example) and those who are not fully vaccinated pay about €25 for a lateral flow and up to €45 for a PCR. Germany abolished its system of free rapid coronavirus testing – used by Germans to get into venues such as theatres and football stadiums – in October. Unvaccinated people – except for pregnant women, children, or those advised against getting a vaccine on medical grounds – had to pay for the tests. The hope was that people would no longer rely on the test system as a way of avoiding getting a vaccine. However, a month later, free tests were reintroduced as authorities struggled to curb rapidly rising infection rates. In South Africa rapid antigen tests sell for 380 ZAR (£18.50), and PCR tests double that. Testing regimes vary across Spain’s 17 self-governing regions. In the Madrid region, the government has so far distributed 5m free antigen tests that can be picked up from pharmacies in and around the capital. In mid-January, the Spanish government capped the price of antigen tests on sale in pharmacies at €2.94. Before the cap was introduced, test kits had been selling for about €10 and were not always available. In Thailand, antigen test kits are sold online, in convenience stores and pharmacies, with prices starting at about 50 baht (£1.13). The government has also started selling antigen tests for 35 baht (79p) at eight locations in Bangkok and online. If you want to travel to a tourist destination, you may be required to take a test before entering, and this can be more expensive. The cost of PCR tests ranges from 1,300 baht in some areas to as much as 4,500 baht. In the US, the cost and access to rapid antigen and PCR testing varies considerably depending on where you live and what health insurance you have, if any. A rapid antigen test can cost about $15 (£11) in a pharmacy or supermarket, but since January there has been a large increase in free testing sites across the country, as well as millions of test kits for schools. PCR tests are available at private clinics, costing $100 or more, but you can also get them free from some hospitals and clinics, though access is very variable. Since 15 January, private health insurance companies have been required to cover the costs of up to eight rapid home tests. For the 28 million or so without health insurance, the Biden administration said it would buy a billion free tests, which people could request online or at local health clinics and pharmacies, though it’s unclear how many have been secured and distributed so far.

2/12/2022,"The Treasury is pushing for most free Covid testing to end as soon as next month to save billions despite warnings from public health experts and scientists. Several sources told the Guardian that Rishi Sunak’s department wants to end most PCR testing for people with Covid symptoms, possibly by the end of March. The exception would be those in hospitals, high-risk settings and for the 1.3m extremely vulnerable people who are eligible for antivirals if they contract Covid.  Under the plans, everyone else with symptoms would be either given some free lateral flow tests or no testing at all. A third option would be restricting the offer of lateral flows to symptomatic people over 50 and the clinically vulnerable. The advice for people without symptoms to take routine lateral flow tests is expected to be scrapped entirely. In Europe, PCR tests can cost more than £30 each while some in the US are double that price. Rapid tests cost £5 to £10 in many countries. It is understood the Treasury has been pushing for the lowest cost options of ending as much testing as possible amid concerns about the huge price tag for mass community testing, which has run into many billions throughout the pandemic. However, the UK Health and Security Agency has been urging caution within the government and has been pushing to keep existing testing arrangements in place until at least 1 April. One source said the Treasury had even questioned at one point whether PCR testing was still necessary for the immunosuppressed, who are eligible for antivirals if they test positive, although this was denied by the government. It comes after Boris Johnson announced plans this week for an end to mandatory isolation for those who test positive for Covid in England, as some Tory MPs push for him to declare the pandemic over and get on with “living with the virus”. At the time, he said free Covid testing would continue for now. The changes are expected to be outlined in a document called Living Safely With Covid, which is due to be published on 21 February. One date mooted for the testing changes is 24 March, to coincide with what will be the two year anniversary of the first lockdown. A second source also said the government was planning to press ahead with removing almost all PCR testing, apart from for the 1.3 million most at risk, and move lateral flow tests mostly to a paid service. The testing regime is also likely to be moved to a home delivery service only, with walk-in centres closed across the country. The health source said public health leaders were “blindsided” when briefed about some of the likely changes by the UK Health and Security Agency chief, Jenny Harries. The dismantling of the testing system will mean many people will have no idea whether or not their symptoms are Covid. In advice to government this week, Sage scientists said that removing access to free testing would make it harder for people to take precautionary actions and increase anxiety among clinically vulnerable groups. The scientists added that the removal of free and accessible testing may be “taken as a signal” that they should continue to attend workplaces or social gatherings while showing Covid-19 symptoms, because these would become conflated with symptoms of other respiratory illnesses such as influenza. There are also concerns among senior scientists leading the genomic surveillance effort in England that a drastic reduction in PCR testing will harm the effort to pick up on new variants. Asked about the proposals to end most free community Covid testing, a government spokesperson said: “We will set out more detail in the plan for living with Covid, but there are no plans to stop free tests when regulations expire.” The date for the expiry of Covid isolation requirements has been brought forward by a month to late February. Another government spokesperson from the Department of Health and Social Care said: “Everyone can continue to get free tests and we are continuing to encourage people to use rapid tests when they need them. Record numbers of tests are being delivered to pharmacies, homes and those who need them. Testing continues to play an important role in helping people live their day to day lives, keep businesses running and keep young people in school.” At the same time, the government is understood to be considering whether to scale back, or even scrap, the UK’s “gold standard” Covid surveillance survey, run by the Office for National Statistics and which is currently funded until April. It is understood that UKHSA has recommended to government that the survey should continue for at least another year. A decision is expected in the coming days. Prof Tim Peto, professor of medicine at Oxford University who is involved in the ONS survey, said that as restrictions were stepped down surveillance was a crucial insurance policy, ensuring that threats from any future high risk variants would be promptly identified. “How big a survey you need is a judgment call,” he said. “It’s a bit like deciding how many nuclear bunkers or flood defences you need.” Given that almost all domestic restrictions will be stood down at the end of February, Peto argues that the ONS survey should be maintained in its current form for at least six months. “After six months, if nothing awful has happened, you can take another look,” he said. On the issue of surveillance for variants, a government spokesperson said: “The UK is committed to maintaining a world-leading surveillance capability as we track the development and impact of Covid-19, including potential new variants of concern.”",News/World news,UK Treasury pushes to end most free Covid testing despite experts’ warnings,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/11/uk-treasury-pushes-to-end-most-free-covid-testing-despite-experts-warnings
2/12/2022,"It’s happened. Australia’s globally famous animal, the koala, is officially listed as endangered – a decision both long expected and completely preventable. It’s important to say this upfront.  Our national list of threatened species is updated regularly. New plants, animals and habitats are added, upgraded, sometimes downgraded, depending on the conservation urgency. Most of the time this happens quietly. But when the animal is the koala, people notice and it can prompt the question: how did we get here? Writing about the environment, I’ve got used to hearing the refrain that extinction is a choice. Or rather it’s a thousand choices – small and large – that lead to cumulative impacts of the kind we have seen this week. The koala populations of Queensland, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, first listed under national law as vulnerable in 2012, have suffered further decline and must now be considered endangered, a rung closer to extinction. This is the right decision by the environment minister, Sussan Ley. It’s based on independent scientific advice and follows years of agitation by environment and community groups about the species’ plight. That plight gained fresh urgency in the aftermath of an unprecedented fire disaster that tore through habitat already under pressure from mining, property development, roads and agriculture. The Australian Conservation Foundation calculated this week that in the 10 years since the former environment minister Tony Burke listed the koala as vulnerable, federal governments alone have approved 25,000 hectares of clearing of koala habitat. One development, Pembroke’s Olive Downs coking coal mine near Moranbah in Queensland, was approved in 2020 for almost 6,000 hectares of clearing. In July last year, the resources minister, Keith Pitt, announced that same project would receive a $175m loan from the government’s northern Australia infrastructure facility for its first stage. It’s a sum worth considering next to the $50m the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced for koala protection only two weeks ago. In the 10 years in which we have known a much-loved species is in trouble, Australian governments of all levels have neglected their responsibility to do something about it. A species recovery plan was delivered to Ley at the end of last year. She plans to adopt it, but it was identified as a necessity a decade ago. We’ve had five other environment ministers in that time, any one of whom could have made it a priority.

In both Queensland and NSW, clearing of habitat continues to increase. Right now, clearing of connecting habitat for southern Sydney’s koala population is occurring for a housing development near Campbelltown. And there has been no thorough response to the recommendations of Graeme Samuel’s review of national environment laws, which found successive governments have failed to protect Australia’s wildlife. The stronger national listing for the koala is recognition of that failure. It’s also an opportunity to do better. This can be turned around and governments know what the solutions are, starting with a commitment to taking the protection of important habitat and nature corridors seriously. If it can’t be done for the koala, then what hope is there for the almost 2,000 other species and habitats on the threatened list?",News/Australia news,We know how to save the endangered koala – it starts with protecting habitat,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/12/we-know-how-to-save-the-endangered-koala-it-starts-with-protecting-habitat
2/12/2022,"In March 2021, a 16-year-old student and an octogenarian nun walked into the federal court in Melbourne for the hearing of a defining case in Australian climate litigation. The lawsuit brought by Anj Sharma, along with seven other teenagers, and Sister Brigid Arthur, is part of a growing trend among climate activists and environment organisations raising climate issues in the courtroom, amid a lack of action by the federal government.  It is also consistent with a trend around the globe, with high-profile cases internationally against the likes of oil company Shell and the Dutch government. Australia now sits second on a climate litigation league table, behind only the United States. As the legal year begins, Guardian Australia outlines the major climate cases likely to make headlines in the months ahead. Environment Minister v SharmaThe devastating impact of the impending climate crisis “will largely be inflicted by the inaction of this generation of adults, in what might fairly be described as the greatest inter-generational injustice ever inflicted,” wrote Justice Mordecai Bromberg last May. With that hard-hitting truth, the federal court judge held that the environment minister, Sussan Ley, owed Australian children a duty of care to mitigate the impact of climate change, which was relevant as she considered approving a major coal mine expansion. Sharma, the lawsuit brought by Anj Sharma, seven other teenagers, and Sister Brigid Arthur, is the most seismic climate judgment in Australia to date. Unsurprisingly, the environment minister appealed. While the first-instance case focused on the application of orthodox legal principles to a changing world, the federal government upped the stakes in the full federal court last October, arguing that the political nature of the case made it unsuited for judicial resolution. The decision is due soon; whatever the outcome, it is likely destined for the high court. Sharma is immensely significant because, grounded in common law negligence rather than administrative law, it cannot be easily overwritten by legislation. If the case holds on appeal, expect similar challenges – both to government decision-making and private sector emitters. Pabai v Commonwealth Similar issues are being argued in Pabai, on an even larger scale, in a case brought by two Torres Strait Islanders. They argue that the federal government as a whole is acting negligently in failing to save the Torres Strait Islands from rising sea levels. The plaintiffs point to the Torres Strait treaty (with Papua New Guinea), native title law and other government initiatives in the region to underscore the duty of care they believe is owed. Failure to act, the pair’s lawyers argue, “will have severe impacts on Torres Strait Islanders, including, injury, disease, and death, rendering some of the islands uninhabitable and displacing Torres Strait Islanders, causing them to become climate refugees”. The federal court case is listed for a case management conference in March. There has been some discussion about taking evidence in the Torres Strait, which means that a quick resolution is unlikely; at the earliest, a judgment might be delivered by the end of the year. Youth Verdict v Waratah Coal In other countries, much successful climate litigation has been focused on human rights obligations. Yet in Australia, in the absence of constitutionally-entrenched rights or a federal charter of rights, such cases have failed to get off the ground. Until now. After Queensland enacted its Human Rights Act in 2019, a coalition of young Queenslanders – Youth Verdict – challenged Clive Palmer’s proposed Galilee basin coal mine. They are arguing that the mine, which would dig up 40 megatonnes of thermal coal each year, violates their right to life, Indigenous cultural rights, rights of children and the right to freedom from discrimination. In late 2020, the group’s claim survived its first test – a preliminary application by Palmer’s company to prevent Youth Verdict relying on human rights grounds in challenging the proposed mine. The relevance of human rights to the mine proposal will be considered in more detail in the coming months. Australasian Centre for Corporation Responsibility v Santos Are major emitters misleading investors when they claim to have a “credible and clear plan” to achieve “net zero” in the coming decades, in the (alleged) absence of such an achievable plan? Is it unlawful to call natural gas “clean energy”, given it is a fossil fuel? These are among the questions to be argued between energy major Santos and shareholder group the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, in a world-first test case filed last year in the federal court. If the ACCR is successful, Australian companies will have to be much more careful in communicating on climate issues, lest they be in breach of corporate and consumer law. The parties are currently undertaking discovery, with the case expected to be heard mid-year. O’Donnell v Commonwealth In another world-first case, a Victorian law student is suing the federal government. Katta O’Donnell alleges the government is misleading investors, and therefore breaching corporate law, by failing to adequately disclose climate risks when issuing long-term sovereign bonds. Last year, the government tried to have the case thrown out, but lost – with Justice Bernard Murphy holding that the plaintiff had set out an arguable case and should be permitted access to government documents to refine her claim. The case will be heard late this year. If the law student wins, O’Donnell could have a major impact globally on the way governments disclose climate risk in financial settings. The first climate case in Australia was brought in 1994, when Greenpeace challenged the construction of a coal-fired power station. In the subsequent decades, most climate litigation has been grounded in administrative law – challenging government decision-making that insufficiently mitigated or entirely ignored climate impact. It is only in recent years that improved science and continuing government and corporate inaction has prompted more creative climate lawyering, using tort law, corporate law, human rights law and beyond. That trend is set to continue. Last year, significant climate litigation cases were filed almost monthly; even more are anticipated this year. “As a nation, we are starting to wake up to how exposed we are to the risks of climate change,” David Barnden, who has masterminded several recent climate cases, previously told Guardian Australia. “The law will respond to that.”",News/Environment,Environment activists in Australia bring the climate crisis to the courtroom | Kieran Pender,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/12/the-environmental-activists-bringing-the-climate-crisis-to-the-courtroom
2/12/2022,"True love may cost a little more this Valentine’s Day with the global supply chain crisis hitting the flower industry and forcing up the cost of a single – albeit pimped up – rose to as much as $70. The Flower Industry Australia chief executive, Anna Jabour, said there had been issues with rose supply for a while now, but this Valentine’s Day was seeing prices in excess of double what roses would normally cost.  “As countries shut down, supply chains shut down, and it did make it harder for flowers to come in,” she said. “But this particular Valentine’s Day, florists have been hit by crazy prices.” Jabour said Ecuadorian roses – a popular import – had been particularly expensive, with prices of up to $140 a dozen for wholesale, which could rise as Valentine’s Day drew closer. Up to 90% of roses are now imported into Australia, which Jabour said would make it increasingly difficult for florists and major supermarkets who relied on imports to price their bouquets reasonably. “Roses have been one of the particular varieties that have wiped out local growers because of cheap labour costs and how cheap they bring them in,” she said. Online florist Mr Roses was offering a box of six imported roses for $99 – not including shipping or vase – while Melbourne-based flower delivery service The Little Market Bunch was charging $68.95 for a single red rose in a box, adorned with a small cutting of baby’s breath (shipping excluded). Leading floral retailer Roses Only was charging $74.95 for a single long-stemmed red rose, nestled in tissue paper and presented in a box complete with chocolates. Jabour said as imported prices rose, the pandemic had seen a greater push towards supporting local and heightened demand for Australian-grown product, which was generally priced more reasonably. “We’ve seen a lot of people asking where flowers are from and demand locally grown flowers,” she said. “The difficulty lies in how much supply there is in the local market. “We encourage everyone to embrace the romance of all fresh Australian grown flowers this Valentine’s Day like beautiful lisianthus, dahlias, lilies, chrysanthemums and the heart shaped anthurium.” It comes as the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission urges consumers to ask where their flowers have been sourced amid reports some large national suppliers are misleading customers their products are local. It has launched an investigation into the operations of online order gatherers – that either create floral arrangements in large distribution centres or outsource purchases. ACCC deputy chair Delia Rickard said consumers were often willing to pay “premium prices” at local florists in the hope for fresh flowers and didn’t know they were cut days earlier and treated with chemicals before being imported. Jan Claire runs C the Market tours of flower markets in Melbourne’s north. Victoria accounts for about half of products grown nationally. “Since Covid, with the government imposed shutdowns, every grower lost a lot of money with snap closures just when flowers were ready for the market,” she said. Claire said freight charges had “skyrocketed” on imports. “There’ll always be flowers, but fewer numbers has affected the price,” she said. “And the general public is oblivious as to whether what they’re buying is local or imported.” There is a push in the flower industry for original labelling to be introduced on products to give consumers greater awareness of where their product has originated. “If the public was aware how many flowers they’re buying are imported there might be a shift – at the moment they’re oblivious,” Claire said. “If people want red roses for Valentines they’ll probably end up with imported, because the local ones have been pre-ordered and snapped up.” Sean Cook has just had to turn to imports himself. A floral designer for weddings and events at Mr Cook, based in Sydney, he said the shortages hitting the market were “really drastic” at the beginning of the pandemic, and while things slowly improved, prices were pushed up. “A lot of flowers at the market are imported, especially during winter,” he said. “All orchids, big Colombian roses, we try to use local when possible but sometimes you just can’t. “In the beginning hardly anything was coming in. Now everything at market is at least 30% more for imported products, which has led local producers to put their prices up too. “It’s crazy, when you tell people what flowers cost they’re like ‘is that the market price?’” Cook said that, for larger orders, many growers just “didn’t take it on” any more, making Valentine’s Day “the perfect storm”.",News/Australia news,All out of love: Valentine’s Day flower prices surge as supply chain crisis hits,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/12/all-out-of-love-valentines-day-flower-prices-surge-as-supply-chain-crisis-hits
2/12/2022,"Quinn Clements, 16, is gender fluid. The pronouns they use can change but they prefer they/them. In year 10 they came out at their all-girls religious school in Melbourne.  “Obviously that was quite nerve-racking. It’s a lot to be at a single-sex school, and to be like I’m not the gender I’m supposed to be while here,” they say. Mentone Girls grammar is a Christian school in Melbourne’s south. Under the Coalition’s proposed religious discrimination bill, Quinn’s teachers would have had the ability to expel them from the school. “I go to a religious school that is supported by the church, and I think I am really lucky to have that support in that environment,” Quinn says. “I thought we moved past hating gay and trans people. I hoped that wasn’t a thing in Australia any more but it so obviously is.” At Mentone, Quinn is accepted for who they are. They have set up weekly meetings for LGBTQ+ students to raise issues, support each other and just hang out. A teacher joins them to help liaise on any changes they want made. They run events, have pushed for sex-ed to not just be “putting condoms on bananas” and wider recognition of chosen names, instead of “dead names” – birth names. On Wednesday night the government suffered a major defeat when five of its members crossed the floor to vote with Labor on amendments to the religious discrimination law, protecting trans children from being expelled because of their identity. The Coalition will now push for a Senate inquiry into the bill, avoiding a vote in the upper house on the legislation before the election. Before the vote attorney general, Michaelia Cash, suggested preventing religious, single-sex schools from discriminating against trans students could lead to complications over bathrooms and uniforms and risk their whole ethos. “Matters such as uniforms, bathrooms, as well as the wishes of other parents to send their children to a single-sex school would need to be addressed,” she says. In Mentone, the LGBTQ+ group is now advocating to have the “female” on bathroom stalls removed, so those who don’t identify that way feel more comfortable. Quinn says the fact a lot of the debate goes back to bathrooms, and if people with different genitals should be allowed in the same one, misses a key point. “Trans people don’t go into bathrooms looking to do anything harmful. They go to pee,” they says. “[The stalls] are private already. People need to stop thinking all trans people are predators. I’m just trying to live my life. I just need to go to the bathroom, I’m not on the hunt.” For many LGBTQ+ students, school is already not the safest place. In June last year, a survey of more than 2,370 Australian high school students who identify as gender diverse and sexuality diverse was conducted by Western Sydney University. It revealed 93% of students had heard homophobic language at school, and of those 37% heard it “almost every day”. A lot of the time teachers did nothing to stop it, the students said, with only 6% of students surveyed saying adults “always” intervened. Some of the case studies were alarming – one student explained that another had thrown an apple at his head after telling him the classroom was for “normal straight people only”, another said her peers used the word “faggot” frequently and teachers never intervened. But when LGBTQ+ students attended schools that were proudly supportive of them they had higher rates of wellbeing, which lead to better academic prospects – with significantly more saying they would attend university. Timothy Simpson, a teacher at Fitzroy high school in Melbourne’s inner north says there is a correlation between how comfortable students feel at school, and how well they do in life. “Kids feel a sense of shame if they’re in an environment where they’re told who they are and how they feel about themselves is not OK,” Simpson says. “That sense of shame, they grow up with that, and it’s a real challenge for a lot of the queer community across the world.” Part of Fitzroy high’s ethos is equality – teachers respect the student’s identities, use proper pronouns, a pride club meets every week and Simpson has even started an elective subject on queer history. “Identity is really important when they move into high school and then adulthood. We try to show them that identity is valued,” he says. ​Riley Christiansen is in year 12 at Doonside Technology high school in Sydney’s west. In 2017 she decided to come out as trans to a teacher in a letter. “I initially had an assignment to write a letter, telling them about my personal life and I decided to come out,” she says. “I felt comfortable around them. I didn’t know they were queer. I said I would like to be out.” The teacher, who was also trans, set up All Sorts – a group for LGBTQ+ students to meet weekly. Riley says the group grew her confidence and was integral to helping her feel supported. “It’s basically a queer safe space,” she says. “The school community is extremely supportive. There is that safe space and opportunity to come to school and feel comfortable, be an individual and know you can thrive.” The teacher who helps run the group now, Connie Tomagra, says she sees students change in a really positive way – knowing themselves and being proud of their differences. “It’s been a really inspiring thing,” she says. “Throughout this time I’ve seen Riley grow into her confidence and become an amazing leader.” In 2010, the Victorian government established the Safe Schools program to ensure schools were safe places for all students. The program expanded nationwide in 2013 before finding itself at the centre of a national controversy, with Nationals MP George Christensen claiming the program worked like a “pedophile grooming a victim”. The Coalition government subsequently stopped funding the program, but schools in Victoria have continued to be supported by the state program. The principal of Swinburne secondary college, Daryl Bennett, has ensured his school has strong links to Safe Schools and other LGBTQ+ organisations such as Minus18. Students walk in Pride every year and across their hallways are posters explaining it’s OK to be who you are. Bennett says he doesn’t know how many trans kids are in the cohort because “we don’t see them as different, they’re just another student, another kid in our community.” Surveys they’ve done show their student body is highly connected to their education, and there are radically low rates of bullying. The proof of how tolerance of diversity equals better life outcomes is in the pudding, Bennett says. “At the end of our valedictory evening we have parents come up and say our students wouldn’t have completed high school, they wouldn’t be going to uni, they wouldn’t be happy, or they’re happier now than they have ever been.” Victoria’s minister for education, James Merlino, says the state had started and kept the program because it worked. “We’ve taken action in Victoria to make sure that in our schools, equality is not negotiable,” he says. “It’s disgraceful that we’re here again debating the right for children to feel equal, safe and valued at school – in Victoria, there is absolutely no place for discrimination in our schools.”",News/Australia news,‘Equality is not negotiable’: the schools embracing gender diversity,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/12/equality-is-not-negotiable-the-schools-embracing-gender-diversity
2/12/2022,"The company behind Australia’s offshore processing regime on Nauru made a $101m profit last financial year – more than $500,000 for each of the fewer than 200 people held on the island. Rard No 3, the holding company for Canstruct International, which has the government contract to run the Nauru offshore processing centre, has more than $340m in cash and investments, according to its most recent accounts filed with the corporate regulator.  When Canstruct International was initially awarded the Nauru contract in 2017 the company had $8 in assets. Its only significant contract is with the federal government to provide “garrison and welfare services” for refugees and asylum seekers held by Australia on the Pacific island. The construction revenue Rard No 3 earned in 2020-21 – $333m – was commensurate with Canstruct International’s Nauru contracts for the period. The company signed two contract extensions worth $303m during the financial year, with other extensions worth hundreds of millions in preceding and future years. Rard No 3 now holds $236m in financial investments and owns three investment properties worth more than $14m. The company also reaped $6m in interest and dividends from its investment portfolio. It made an after-tax profit of $69.5m in 2018-19 and $101m in 2019-20 and again in 2020-21. The number of refugees and asylum seekers held by Australia on Nauru diminished steadily over the course of 2020-21, from 185 to 108 by the end of the financial year. There are currently 115 people held by Australia on the island, with the transfer of people from the offshore regime on PNG to Nauru, and the departure of some refugees for America. It currently costs the Australian taxpayer more than $4m each year to hold a single refugee or asylum seeker on Nauru, or nearly $12,000 a day, according to government figures. In its latest report, filed late to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the company did not comment on its future on Nauru. The Australian government has committed to an “enduring” offshore processing regime on the island but intends to hand control of the centre over to the Nauru government at some point. Canstruct International’s most recent extension was to the end of June this year. “Likely developments in the operation of the group and the expected results of those operations in future financial years have not been included in this report as the inclusion of such information is likely to result in unreasonable prejudice to the group,” the company stated. “Although it is expected that there will be changes to the company’s activities in the near future, it is still unclear as to the extent of the changes predicted.” The directors of Rard No 3 are four members of the Murphy family – the founding director of the Canstruct group of companies, Robin Murphy, and his three sons, Adrian, Rory and Daniel. The Canstruct group, or entities associated with it, have made 11 donations to the Liberal National party in Queensland. The company has previously strenuously denied any link between political donations and the awarding of any contracts. Canstruct International’s Nauru contract has attracted significant parliamentary interest and repeated questioning in the Senate. The October 2017 “letter of intent” awarded to Canstruct International was worth $8m. But a government-ordered financial strength test, conducted by KPMG, to test the company’s fitness for the contract, was erroneously conducted on a different company. KPMG reported its pre-contract financial strength assessment was conducted on Canstruct International Pty Ltd – but the government, after twice having to correct its evidence to the Senate, has since confirmed the assessment was actually undertaken on Canstruct Pty Ltd, a company also controlled by the Murphy family, but with which it had no financial relationship. Less than a month after the letter of intent was signed, the company won a $385m contract awarded by limited tender. Since then, government figures show eight further non-competitive amendments to the contract, raising the total cost to $1.82bn. The most recent contract extension was in January, to 22 June, for $218.5m.

2/12/2022,"Mirabai Nicholson-McKellar tested positive for Covid-19 the same month the World Health Organization officially declared a global pandemic. She had just returned to Australia from Berlin, where she had been working as a film-maker and beekeeper. She had nerve pain and headaches, and lost her sense of smell and taste, but felt relieved to have “escaped with what they were saying was a very mild case of Covid”.  But other symptoms developed later: “lightning bolt headaches that would feel like my brain was splitting in two”, sinus pain, nausea, diarrhoea, chest pain, breathing difficulties. “I thought I was going mad,” she says. Almost two years later, the effects of the virus still linger. “I still experience crippling fatigue. I have issues with sleep and brain cognition and memory,” she says. “I can’t think straight, I can’t remember things.” It has left her unable to work. “Having Covid has completely changed my life,” says Nicholson-McKellar, who is in her 30s and now lives near Byron Bay. “For the last almost two years I’ve been living in a caravan on my brother’s property because I can’t afford to pay rent. “I’ve had different doctors that have been great and … supportive, and I’ve had other interactions with people who have listened very sympathetically to all my symptoms, and basically fobbed them off as anxiety,” she says. She is frustrated by what she sees as a binary characterisation of Covid: perceptions that it is either like “a mild flu, or you end up in hospital and you might die”. “What about the rest of us that get mild to moderate Covid, we manage to stay at home, but we never seem to recover?” Public health experts have warned that Australia is flying blind when it comes to accurately assessing the scale of long Covid, with some estimating there may be 10,000 cases of the syndrome in the country by the end of the year. Over the last two years researchers have gained a clearer picture of what causes long Covid and the myriad effects it has on the body. In October the WHO formalised a clinical definition of the condition: it usually begins three months after symptomatic Covid-19 infection, lasts for at least two months and can’t be explained by an alternative diagnosis. The research community has known for some time that the syndrome, also known as PASC – post-acute sequelae of Covid-19 – can affect nearly every organ system, says Dr Ziyad Al-Aly, director of clinical epidemiology and assistant professor at the School of Medicine at Washington University in St Louis in the US. One theory for what causes long Covid is that the virus lingers in reservoirs in the body, triggering a chronic inflammatory response. Another is that the virus causes the immune system to misfire and attack the body, with similarities to an autoimmune condition. More than 200 symptoms of long Covid have been identified to date, including, most commonly, fatigue and brain fog. Symptoms can vary widely: heart palpitations, blurred vision, tinnitus, tremors, sexual dysfunction. “The idea that viruses can have long-term ramifications isn’t really new. We have decided over the past 100 years not to pay attention to it,” Al-Aly says, citing a lack of funding for research into other post-viral conditions such as ME/CFS – chronic fatigue syndrome, also known as ​​myalgic encephalomyelitis. In both ME/CFS and long Covid, symptoms are wide-ranging and often subjective, which makes them difficult to understand and can predispose people to scepticism, says Dr Elisha Josev at the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute. Josev, who has studied ME/CFS in adolescents, says overlapping symptoms include cognitive difficulties, unrelenting fatigue and post-exertional malaise – in which symptoms are severely worsened by even minor activity. “They really do bear a striking resemblance to each other,” she says. While progress has been made since the beginning of the pandemic, a lack of recognition of long Covid and clinicians telling patients “it’s all in your head” still occurs, Al-Aly says. New research co-authored by Al-Aly, published this week in Nature Medicine, compared cardiovascular outcomes in 153,760 Americans who have had Covid with more than 11 million people who haven’t. More than 30 days after infection, people who’d had Covid were at higher risk of conditions including heart attack, stroke, heart failure, myocarditis and pericarditis – even when the initial infection was mild or asymptomatic. “The evidence is absolutely, compellingly clear,” Al-Aly says. “These are manageable conditions … but they’re certainly not curable conditions,” he says. “It’s very clear to me now that there are a bunch of long-haulers who will bear the scars of this pandemic for a lifetime. “Everyone is so obsessed with counting the acute issues … the number of Covid cases, hospitalisations, deaths in the first 30 days,” Al-Aly says. “That’s really the tip of the iceberg.” Olivia, a Melbourne woman in her early 30s, has been trying to get medical help for her long Covid for 18 months. She was admitted to hospital at the beginning of 2020 with cardiac and respiratory distress, but fatigue and brain fog are now what trouble her. “I used to do extreme sports multiple times a week, and now it’s once a fortnight or once a month, and then I have to recover [afterwards],” she says. “Before I had Covid, I ran my own business as well as my full-time job,” she says. Afterwards, it became exhausting to look at screens, and she began to misspell or use incorrect words in emails. “I can’t read or write long bits of text … It’s like I’d developed dyslexia.” She was later made redundant. Olivia has recently been referred to a brain clinic at a Melbourne hospital and is set to begin rehabilitation soon. “I would have liked to get help earlier,” she says. “I don’t want to be in this position. I could have been getting rehab a year ago.” Long Covid needs to be taken seriously, says Dr Karen Price, president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. “GPs are under enormous pressure right now. We are caring for Covid-19 positive patients in the community and managing long Covid as well as the vaccine rollout, on top of our day-to-day care and catchup care from patients who delayed or avoided healthcare during the pandemic,” she says. “The RACGP has developed guidelines to support GPs caring for patients experiencing long Covid, which include information on the mental health impacts of the acute illness and acknowledging and validating the patient’s experiences.” The wide variety of long Covid’s effects can make it difficult to manage, with no single drug that can definitively treat the condition. Rehabilitation may require the input of many different health professions, says Scott Willis, national president of the Australian Physiotherapy Association. Willis has a unique experience of the syndrome, both treating patients with long Covid and having had it himself. He contracted the virus in April 2020 from a hospital in Tasmania. Prior to infection he swam 3km four times a week and also ran and cycled. “It’s been quite a frustrating 18 months,” he says. Although he has been able to return to physical activity, he has never regained his pre-Covid fitness level. “I’ve been to exhaustion point with fitness, but Covid exhaustion – it’s completely different,” he says. “It’s like your whole body shuts down, there’s no power in your legs, no power in your arms.” Willis has been able to identify what triggers his long Covid symptoms and avoid overexerting himself to the point of extreme fatigue. He has taken a similar approach while working with long Covid patients at Coastal Physiotherapy, the practice he co-directs. “What we try and get them to do is a lot of intermittent activities so that they don’t get to a threshold that takes them into an acute flareup,” he says. Willis is calling for better follow-up of Covid patients in Australia. “There has got to be some communication between the acute setting in hospitals and primary healthcare,” he says. Willis says the federal government should introduce dedicated items on the Medicare Benefits Schedule for the treatment of long Covid. “If you go to a GP and you’ve got long Covid, it’s just billed under Medicare as normal. There’s no tracking or tracing of those people. “They might need some psychology, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, social work. They might need some medical intervention because of a heart condition,” he says. “These types of things need to be more integrated.” On good days Nicholson-McKellar tries to appreciate the slower pace of her new life, tending to her garden and bees. On bad days, when her symptoms flare up, she grieves the life she once had. “I keep being told, ‘Oh, you will eventually recover’, but we don’t actually know that,” she says. “An incredibly challenging part of this illness is … not knowing if this is now the way my life will be forever.” A doctor has prescribed her with medications that have alleviated some of her symptoms and improved her quality of life. “I feel supported,” she says. “I know that at this point that is a holding pattern, to hope that there are some treatments that come out of new research that will actually help me recover rather than just help me cope.”",News/Society,‘We never seem to recover’: the Australians grappling with long Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/12/we-never-seem-to-recover-the-australians-grappling-with-long-covid
2/12/2022,"The far right “trucker convoy” that has paralysed Ottawa might be singularly shocking, but what disturbs the most is it’s not unique. “Freedom” protests similar in form and simultaneously nebulous in broadly anti-vax/anti-mandate political goals have materialised in Britain, France and New Zealand. A convoy claiming to originate from across Europe is making its way towards Brussels. An ongoing gathering that locals alternately describe as “Spring Break for QAnon” or “Camp Covid” is encamped outside Australian Parliament House in Canberra.  Across these countries, protestors appear as a wild herd of “sovcit”, anti-vaxxer, QAnonner and more nefarious fellow travellers, alongside some more ordinary people. Sometimes it’s hard to tell whether social media content about these events has been gathered by extremism monitors, or comedians. Participants unwilling to be injected with a free vaccine safely used on hundreds of millions of people further advise each other that drinking one’s own wee is curative and somehow “camel urine deals with cancer”. Monitors observe attendees costumed as paramedics, pilots and deceased Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. Someone really wears a tinfoil hat. In New Zealand, the monitors themselves hijacked the Telegram and Zello channels the protestors use to organise. They’ve sown chaos and crammed the convoy’s Spotify playlist with songs like Redneck Piece of White Trash, Why Don’t You Get a Job and Dumb Fuck. In Canada, protestors have used their vehicles to blockade entire Ottawa neighbourhoods, erecting jumping castles and even saunas. Participants stiffly stage ceremonies to anoint one another faux powers of police. Amid the carnival of crank it all reads like character-based black comedy … but this investment in a parallel reality is not satire. It’s not performance. It’s complete. It’s terrifying. Wherever this “freedom movement” manifests, a similar cast of characters emerges. Light-in-the-eyes zealots holler conspiracy theories. Grifters solicit to camera like a roll of tabloid clickbait. Burly, closed-mouth types appear to be handling secretive logistics. Around them are impassioned, often inarticulate – and poorly-costumed – clowns. Don’t let the ridiculousness distract from the threat. I spent a year undercover in the broadly QAnon movement researching a book; I understand well why democratic citizens may struggle to take seriously the crossed streams of alien lizard aficionados, drink-your-own-wee health enthusiasts and those people who believe democrats eat children’s faces. Even while besieged in his capital and struggling to contain the protests, Canadian PM Justin Trudeau hasn’t yet called in the army; he’s made the point that in more than 80%-vaxxed Canada, those protesting vaccine mandates are indeed a “fringe” – the truckers aren’t backed by their unions, more than 90% of their industry is vaccinated. The tomfoolery in Canberra could not be considered a representative movement of Australians either. Like New Zealanders and the Europeans, we’re a country with a high vaccination rate too. But the relevant historical lesson is that the threat to democracy doesn’t come from the proportion of the people these groups can claim to represent. It’s about the size of the damage they are willing to do. Writing off Canberra’s buffoon insurgency just as a loud thing blocking the carpark is a mistake. What was learned from last year’s United States Capitol attack of 6 January and Melbourne’s violent anti-lockdown protests was that people don’t have to be able to comprehend the politics of the movement they’re in to be weaponised by them. The swastikas, confederate flags and other sly hate symbols that appeared at protests go wilfully unheeded by the wellness-influenced anti-vaxxers and others literally marching beside them. William Saletan recently made the frightening point that those Americans who have become the greatest threat to their republic are those who’ve been convinced by propaganda lies that they’re saving it. Canadian researchers claim what’s now happening in Ottowa is both driven by the cultural narratives of the American right and simultaneously serving a propaganda function as a proxy battlefront for it. The “trucker protest” has been sustained by American money pouring into it by the millions. The likes of Ted Cruz and Donald Trump are making positive talking points of the actions as “standing up for freedom”, perpetuating the same kind of myths Cruz and others made last year insisting pro-vax Australia had descended into some sort of totalitarian dictatorship. Different countries’ protests may claim they’re just “inspired” by one another, but a chilling tactical similarity to the protests suggests a deeper level of international coordination. Last year, the Logically group revealed Melbourne’s protests occurred among worldwide action devised and organised by extremists from Germany. Supposedly local organisers in Canada and Australia have been tracked to foreign servers, operating hacked accounts. Observe now how the same behaviours – from shared language, icons and slogans to their direct organising tactics on the ground – are common across the protests. Note that their political targets are consistently the apparatus of democratic government itself. The street-level participants of these protests don’t have to be slick, admirable or coherent to be useful to this movement – just credulous, unquestioning and willing to be mobilised. Where the protest presence grows, so do arson attacks and warnings of escalating violence. The Museum of Australian Democracy was recently set on fire; it’s time to face we are in the era of Brownshirts Without Borders. Unless we can formulate international tactics for dealing with them, it’s not just Ottawa that’s under siege. It’s democracy in the west.",Opinion/Opinion,The global ‘freedom movement’ is a carnival of crank and conspiracy – and very dangerous | Van Badham,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/12/the-global-freedom-movement-is-a-carnival-of-crank-and-conspiracy-and-very-dangerous
2/12/2022,"Last Sunday, amid jubilant scenes at the Pier Luigi Penzo Stadium, Napoli scored a 100th-minute goal to seal a 2-0 win over Venezia, cutting Internazionale’s lead in Serie A to a single point. The following morning, tickets for their next game – a potential title showdown at home to Inter – went on general sale. Almost immediately, Napoli’s ticket website began to gasp under the sheer volume of traffic. Disgruntled fans complained to the club after spending hours refreshing and rebooting the page, sitting in virtual queues of about 15,000. The stadium box office was a similar story, as restive queues stretched out of the club shop – although, this being Naples, the word “queue” demands a certain imaginative latitude on the reader’s part – and on to the street. The head of Napoli’s official ticket platform fiercely rejected suggestions of a technical problem, instead blaming fans for attempting to purchase tickets despite not possessing the required documentation.  Anger out of elation; expectation stalked by disappointment and resentment; an orderly process slowly and inexorably crumbling into chaos: as it turned out, this felt like a pretty fitting buildup to Napoli’s biggest game of the season, a fixture that could make or break their campaign to win a first league championship in 32 years. This is, after all, a club with their own particular set of neuroses, foremost of which is a belief that nothing good ever came without a few complications. “Vietato parlare di scudetto,” the club’s owner, Aurelio De Laurentiis, said last weekend. “It is forbidden to talk about the championship.” And when you have been burned as many times as Napoli, perhaps a certain superstition is inevitable. Four times in the past nine seasons they have finished runners-up to Juventus. In 2018, Maurizio Sarri’s team finished with 91 points, a total high enough to have won 24 of the past 27 Serie A titles. It was one of the greatest seasons in the club’s history. It didn’t matter, because Juventus got 95. But Juve are not in the picture this time, even if they are close enough in fourth to be an outside threat. Instead the pace is being set by Inter, Napoli and Milan, all within a point of one other at the top. Beat Inter on Saturday evening and Napoli would go two points clear, having played a game more but with all the momentum on their side. The dream is real. But invoking it – actually confronting the possibility that they could achieve what no Napoli side have managed without Diego Maradona – feels almost as significant an obstacle as the title itself. For now Napoli are underdogs, which suits them fine. “Inter is still the team with the greatest potential,” their manager, Luciano Spalletti, insists, and when it comes to experience and finance and trophy-winning pedigree, it’s hard to argue. For all the strides Napoli have made off the pitch, they have only the fifth-highest wage bill in Serie A, after Juventus, the two Milan clubs and Roma. This season, like most seasons, a Champions League place was probably the limit of their ambitions. Then came a spectacular autumn in which Napoli won their first eight games and as of mid-November were the last unbeaten club in Europe’s big five leagues. But as happened 12 months earlier, Napoli’s form dipped just as the fixtures began to pile up. By the time they lost 1-0 at home to Spezia just before Christmas – their third defeat in four – they were seven points behind Inter. With a litany of injuries and the Africa Cup of Nations claiming the midfielder André-Frank Zambo Anguissa (who you may know from his Fulham days) and centre-half Kalidou Koulibaly (who you may know from every transfer gossip column since 2015), Napoli appeared destined for another season of nearly but not quite. But quietly over the past few years, first under Gennaro Gattuso, then Spalletti, Napoli have been building something: a squad high on technical ability and defensive solidity, based around a stable core. The skeleton of the side – Koulibaly and Mário Rui in defence, Dries Mertens, Lorenzo Insigne, Piotr Zielinski and Fabián Ruiz in the final third – has been in place for three or four years. A shrewd recruitment policy has often involved sourcing players overlooked by bigger clubs – Inter’s Matteo Politano, Arsenal’s David Ospina, Manchester United’s Axel Tuanzebe, who has joined on loan. But perhaps the biggest signing of all was also Napoli’s biggest gamble. Victor Osimhen joined from Lille in the summer of 2020 for about €70m. A talented but largely untested striker who cost about double Napoli’s previous transfer record – in the middle of a pandemic – it was a decision that could have gone badly wrong. In his injury-plagued first six months at Napoli, he scored two goals, earned one red card and contracted Covid after returning to Nigeria for a birthday party. One pundit described him as the biggest failure in Serie A. But when Osimhen finally came good, he changed everything. Quick over the ground, sharp in the penalty area and dominant in the air, with a high defensive work rate and a deadly shot, Osimhen was in many ways the missing piece of the puzzle: the deadly centre-forward Napoli had been missing since the sale of Gonzalo Higuaín in 2016. Spalletti’s team are more patient and possession-based, a machine “built to win every game” as he puts it, and Osimhen’s ability to fashion goals out of almost nothing has been a large part of their success. In this and other respects, this Napoli side feel strikingly different to their predecessors. Naples, the city and the club, has long enjoyed a reputation for glorious chaos, chaotic glory, dysfunction pursued by triumph pursued by disaster, a cycle of romance and inevitable failure. Nobody embodied this better than Maradona, who in seven unruly years restored pride to the city, won the only two league titles in Napoli’s history, and left in disgrace and ruin. By contrast, this is a Napoli side built on control and composure, with a professional outlook and the best defensive record in the division (and not even Maradona’s sides could claim that). Maradona is dead, and what used to be the Stadio San Paolo now bears his name. The era and the energy he embodied have never felt more like ancient history, a relic to venerate while the present generation tries to build something new. They still yearn for glory as deeply as they ever did. But not, you feel, for the same reasons they did. The stadium will be half-full owing to Covid restrictions. Even if Napoli win, Inter will have that game in hand and a more favourable fixture list. There are plenty of twists to come in Europe’s most exciting title race. But Napoli have the form and the home advantage. Technically and tactically, they’re good enough. Saturday may just tell us whether they genuinely believe it.",Sport/Football,Buoyant Napoli face ultimate test in title push that dare not speak its name | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/11/napoli-inter-serie-a-title-push-maradona
2/12/2022,"“Where are you going to sit?” a burly rodeo master asks young girl Molly, gesturing towards a group of Aboriginal townspeople: “On our side, or with the animals?” The line draws a palpable wince from the audience but would not be misplaced in 1969, when new Australian musical Panawathi Girl is set: just two years after a landmark referendum gave the federal government the power to make laws for Aboriginal people.  These clandestine segregation practices, and the broader legacy of racist policy in Australia, are playfully explored in the Indigenous-led show, which had its world premiere at Perth festival on Thursday. Unfolding in the Western Australian outback, the self-described “big Black musical” captures the exuberance and progressivism of the late 1960s, combining deceptively jolly humour and song to explore the changing face of Australia at a time of great political transformation. Written by David Milroy – the multi-award winning playwright behind Waltzing the Wilarra – Panawathi Girl is Yirra Yaakin Theatre Company’s largest stage production to date presented on Western Australia’s grandest stage, His Majesty’s Theatre. With an all-WA cast directed by Eva Grace Mullaley, it continues a string of nationally acclaimed Perth festival productions including The Sum of Us and the all-Noongar-language Shakespeare adaptation, Hecate. Translating to “dream girl” in Milroy’s mother’s Palyku language, Panawathi Girl follows the story of Molly Panawathi Chubb (played by newcomer Lila McGuire) as she ventures from Perth, where she has been studying politics, to her hometown, Chubb Springs, to reconnect with her mob. Molly reunites with her father, Chubb (Peter Docker), a rough and tumble white country bloke who is incensed by his daughter’s progressive views – reflecting the changing political tides of the era and the widening chasm between urban and rural Australia. Molly, whose mother is Indigenous, is between two worlds, not quite fitting in at either camp and having her pleas for an end to segregation sharply rebuffed. But it’s the rejection of the Black community that cuts the deepest. Heading into her second year of Waapa’s bachelor of acting course, McGuire, a Whadjuk and Wardandi Noongar woman, is audibly nervous at the premiere’s opening, but settles in as the production progresses, delivering her dialogue with sass and aplomb and showcasing a flawless vocal tone that shines in numbers such as Shadow in the Dark. Milroy’s comedic chops shine with the characters of Gough and Gorton: caricatures of Gough Whitlam (Luke Hewitt) and John Gorton (Geoff Kelso) on the 1969 federal election trail. In Long White Sock, the big-noting pair march triumphantly around the stage singing about giving our history a hysterectomy and soaking it in bleach, and on the campaign trail in Chubb Springs, Gorton announces he’ll fix Sydney’s traffic congestion – poking fun at the disconnection between Canberra and regional Australia. Following the Panawathi Girl to Chubb Springs is the lovesick Ron (Chris Isaacs) and his friends Beth (Grace Chow) and JoJo (Manuao TeAotonga). This high-spirited trio are a giddy delight to watch – owing, in part, to the space cakes they consume en route – each in their own way exemplifying the struggles of young people in the 60s, in particular Ron’s dread about being conscripted to Vietnam and JoJo’s exploration of his queer identity at a time when homosexuality was a criminal act. Perhaps the finest moment comes when Pansy (Angelica Lockyer), Billy (Wimiya Woodley) and Ada (Teresa Rose) come together to perform The Fire Is Burning, a soulful ballad sung partly in language. Delivered with honesty and open-heartedness, it has the audience in full rapture, and Pansy’s solo is breathtaking. Bruce McKinven’s elegant set design takes audiences to the sweeping north-west landscapes of WA, with a glowing Pilbara moon, the facades of quaint clapboard houses and an expansive cyclorama depicting the region’s fire-engine red sunsets and cloudy-blue skies. Look carefully and you’ll spot Milroy himself, performing in the five-piece band led by music director Wayne Freer and featuring Grammy award-winner Lucky Oceans; an intimate stage set-up that feels a bit like a knee-slapping country pub band. There are, however, some missteps. The singing in some parts feels a little wobbly, muted even, perhaps owing to some early season jitters that will be ironed out. The storyline around Molly and her mother was left wanting too; perhaps in opening that up, the production could have offered a moment for some deeper reflections on the cultural and spiritual trauma that has left First Nations people “standing in the doorway for too long”. It could also have balanced out the saccharine numbers that at times feel more Oklahoma than regional WA. But then again, hitting audiences over the head with a dark and dour message isn’t Milroy’s style. Brimming with heart and humour, Panawathi Girl is a wildly entertaining glimpse into an era of great optimism and change, prompting us to consider how far, or how little, we’ve come in the last 50 years.

2/12/2022,"The Coalition has weaponised climate change at every election since Tony Abbott took the Liberal party leadership. Weaponising doesn’t have to involve lying, but when it comes to climate policy, there’s been truckloads of bullshit as well. Unsurprising, then, that Scott Morrison – in between the rebellion of Liberal moderates on Thursday morning and a damaging cabinet leak in the afternoon – returned to the climate policy fray during question time. Hello darkness, my old friend.  Morrison was asked why he wouldn’t back Labor’s 43% medium-term emissions reduction target given that the assistant minister for emissions reduction, Tim Wilson, had said the former combatants were “more close than we’ve ever been before and all broadly swimming in the same direction”. In response to this apparent provocation – the prospect of an end to a decade of bollocks – the prime minister extracted a dusty Abbott onesie from an invisible wardrobe and promptly zipped up. “Because Labor policies put up electricity prices,” Morrison declared. “Because Labor policies on emissions reduction close down manufacturing, close down the resources industry, take away people’s livelihoods. “They adopt targets that they can’t achieve by simply pursuing technology targets, and they have to pursue it by putting up the cost of electricity on households and businesses and drive people out of jobs. That’s why we don’t adopt the Labor party’s policies.” Hmm, yes, well. Couple of things. Last time I checked, Australia’s resources giants remained global behemoths, which are actively planning a transition to a net zero international trading environment, and local manufacturing was still happening. As for electricity costs, the Reputex modelling underpinning Labor’s policy suggests electricity prices will be lower as a consequence of a commitment to build more transmission infrastructure. That modelling says residential customers are estimated to save $50/Mwh by 2025 and $69/Mwh by 2030, with an annual electricity bill for an average household projected to be $275 lower by 2025 and $378 lower by 2030. For completeness, I need to be clear that some energy experts have queried some of the Reputex assumptions. But thus far at least, the critiques I’ve seen have been queries rather than demolitions. In any case, Abbott-onesie Morrison was completely transparent about who he was speaking to on Thursday. “So, if you’re living up there in the Hunter, if you’re living in La Trobe, if you’re up there in the Northern Territory or in the resources industry in Western Australia, if the Labor party seeks to form a government after this election, they’ll be doing it with the Greens, and they’ll be putting up your electricity prices, and they’ll be selling out the blue collar jobs of this country.” Hopefully the voters of Goldstein, Wentworth, and North Sydney weren’t tuned in at that point because that would be awkward. The point of me starting here this weekend isn’t to state the obvious. If you’ve been following politics, you’ll already know that Morrison is now for and against climate action depending on which constituency he’s spamming. The point of the anecdote is to issue a general public service announcement. The desperation on show during this past parliamentary week tells us we’ve entered the “whatever it takes” zone of pre-campaign campaigning. Folks, it is time to strap in, because when it comes weaponisation and outright lying, over the next few months, we are going to breach mach 3. Morrison’s sole political objective at the moment, apart from avoiding being incinerated either accidentally or deliberately in an internal government bin fire, is to pivot out of the pandemic, which is no longer an automatic political winner for him, and into Big Daddy Will Keep You Safe From All The Scary Things – Scary (and Suspect) Labor Most Of All. During the same question time where Abbott-onesie Morrison was dusting off the greatest hits of the climate wars, Peter Dutton, in hot pursuit of some version of a khaki election, was also back to the future on national security. The defence minister said Labor wanted to pretend there was no difference between the two parties “when it comes to defending our nation in the next decade and the decade beyond” but that “nothing could be further from the truth”. Before anyone could take the pantomime cue and boo or hiss, Dutton went full Manchurian candidate. “We now see evidence that the Chinese Communist party has also made a decision about who they’re going to back in the next federal election … and that is open and obvious,” he said. “That’s open. That is obvious. And they have picked this bloke, the leader of the opposition, as their candidate.” Right at that moment, I remembered a senior Liberal strategist telling me after a hyperbolic outburst from Dutton about asylum seekers and terrorism during the 2016 election (when the campaign theme was supposed to be there’s never been a more exciting time): “Look, Dutton is a dickhead, but he’s our dickhead.” I’m not sure why that particular memory surfaced during question time on Thursday, but in any case I digress. The times really are very serious, both domestically, and geopolitically. Australia sits in a dangerous region where escalating militarisation narrows the scope for transactional pragmatism between neighbours with different values and political systems. Foreign interference is a serious problem imperilling democracies. All democratic institutions are vulnerable. This is the reality we face. In his threat assessment speech on Wednesday evening, the Asio boss, Mike Burgess, said the domestic spy agency had “recently detected and disrupted a foreign interference plot” in the run-up to “an election in Australia”. The risks are not hypothetical, or invented. It’s also fair to say Beijing will take an interest in the outcome of the looming Australian election, and may initiate covert action with a view to furthering what it perceives as its interests. Australia’s position on China has hardened significantly in recent years, reflecting both strenuous advocacy by intelligence agencies, and the darkening strategic environment. China will be wondering right now whether or not a change in government in Canberra could precipitate a thaw in the bilateral relationship. You would wonder about that if you were Xi Jinping. But wondering about that doesn’t mean you’ve picked a candidate. Old fashioned, I know, but nuances are generally what separate verifiable facts from florid partisan invention. Staying in the realm of facts as opposed to the exigencies of crude partisanship, Anthony Albanese, and Bill Shorten before him, are regarded well by Canberra’s security hawks. There’s a view that the two most recent Labor leaders have a more realistic appraisal of the threat an increasingly autocratic China poses to Australia’s sovereignty than Abbott had when he came to office nearly a decade ago (and by realistic, read hawkish). To be fair to Abbott, events have shifted significantly in the past decade, but you get the point. Albanese is regarded as professional and switched on. Given the seriousness of the times, given there are higher stakes in play than the LNP’s primary vote in a few months time, it would be reassuring if Australia had a defence minister who could get a grip. I suspect Dutton is too blunt an instrument to appreciate irony, but there is a fundamental irony about a defence minister hyperventilating about risk when that very same defence minister demonstrates a measurable appetite for partisan recklessness. One last point. Obviously Dutton has a lot of rusted-on supporters in the Coalition. But when it comes to extended auditions for the top job – whenever there might be a vacancy – I’m confident some of the defence minister’s more measured Liberal colleagues also preferred the Dutton who thought he might smile more to the Dutton limbering up for full le Carré. If the Liberals are to hold on to the government benches, the party will actually need some votes south of the Tweed.",News/Australia news,"At the prospect of ending a decade of climate bollocks, the PM donned a dusty Abbott onesie and zipped up | Katharine Murphy",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/12/at-the-prospect-of-ending-a-decade-of-climate-bollocks-the-pm-donned-a-dusty-abbott-onesie-and-zipped-up
2/12/2022,"As house prices soar to record levels across capital cities, an increasing number of younger Australians are giving up on the hope of owning a house with a backyard. Raising a family in an apartment is fast becoming the new, compact Australian dream. However, the boom in apartment construction in recent decades – led largely by investors buying off the plan – has brought with it design and quality problems that in many cases have turned the scaled-down dream home into a cramped, unliveable nightmare.  Horror stories of structurally defective blocks such as the Opal Tower at Sydney Olympic Park and legal battles over responsibility have made headlines in recent years. But it need not be that way. Planning in overseas cities, and in some in Australia, is encompassing more liveable regulations that cater to the people who want to live in the apartments they buy, not rent them out. So how do planners, architects and builders make the new Australian dream more appealing? The prevalence of apartments in the Australian housing market had been growing even before the gulf between unit and detached house prices radically widened. At the 2016 census, there was one occupied apartment for every five separate houses – up from one for every seven in 1991. While apartment living boasts its own lifestyle benefits, experts point to the astronomical rise in house prices as the dominant force driving Australians into apartments. In Sydney, the median house price has skyrocketed, more than doubling from $533,000 in December 2011 to $1.22m in September 2021, while the median price of apartments rose from $460,000 to $790,000 over the same period. The types of apartments available to Australians have changed considerably, with high-rise blocks becoming a proven profit maker for developers. In 1996, 18% of Australia’s occupied apartments were in buildings of four or more storeys, but by 2016, more than 38% of the 463,000 occupied apartments in the country were in high rise. The 2021 census is likely to reveal an even higher figure. State governments have struggled to regulate standards amid this explosion in apartment building. Apartment design standards in NSW, known as SEPP65 and introduced in the early 2000s, are acknowledged as an early gold standard for mandating minimum room sizes and light sources. On the flip side, some experts say the prescriptive rules have contributed to an unimaginative template-style generation of high rises. But Victoria’s late adoption of similar standards, in 2017, allowed an earlier a wave of apartments to be built with an average size of 44 square metres and reliance on “borrowed light” in bedrooms – where the only window is internal. A parliamentary inquiry into apartment design standards is now under way in Victoria. The Labor MP Sarah Connolly, who is chairing the committee, is conscious of the need to ensure a better minimum standard. “There’s a lot of people choosing to live in apartments to be their home and people should feel really proud of the home they live in,” she says. “There are simple things, the way in which showers in a lot of apartments can’t fit a baby bathtub inside, which is just crucial … and proper lighting can really affect your mental health.” Connolly says a common theme that has emerged in the inquiry is the structure of the market. “A huge proportion of people buying off the plan are investors, people who will never live there, so they’re not really thinking about the lifestyle in these apartments. “Are they thinking about if they can bathe their baby in the shower?” she says. Prof Ralph Horne, the associate deputy vice-chancellor of RMIT’s College of Design and Social Context, says the engineering of many modern apartment buildings means substantial renovations are structurally impossible – unlike art deco blocks and smaller apartment buildings from previous decades built with the foresight to allow renovations. “Once these blocks are built we’re stuck with them,” he says. Horne has studied apartment living across Melbourne, Perth, London and Barcelona, which included interviewing 250 families living in high rises. He says the design of apartments in Europe makes them more attractive for residents. “There is a possibility of knowing your neighbours above, below and to the side. But in apartments in Melbourne, many of the apartments that share balconies or other shared light sources block them out for privacy reasons, because that sense of privacy isn’t addressed in the design.” Horne found poor use of space was a common design flaw in Australian apartments. “We came across kitchens where there was no room to put recycling, and where people had to keep food in the dishwasher, because there was nowhere else… “Although bedrooms may meet size guidelines, you find that you can’t get a double bed into some and still have enough room to move around. The design of some of these bedrooms makes them unusable spaces.” Horne argues overseas investors are being ripped off when they buy off the plan in some of the worst “vertical slums”, noting some apartments have decreased in value in recent years. Dr Tom Alves, head of development at the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute, says the fact that most apartments in Australia are owned by foreign investors and occupied by renters perpetuates the lack of attention to sympathetic design. “How do you get that consumer influence into the standards? That’s the question.” Alves points to developments such as Nightingale – not-for-profit sustainable projects that focus on shared living spaces, and sell only to people who plan to live there, never to investors. The model saves costs by bypassing real estate agencies and not spending on marketing – considerable drivers of costs for other high-rise developments. However, in Australia, developers have deeper pockets than owner-occupier groups to buy land. Alves points to better practices in cities overseas, such as Berlin, where the local government will reserve some areas for such owner-occupier models to buy and develop land for apartments. “Where the state has the capacity to dictate those terms, it’s helpful,” he says. Natalia Krysiak, an associate at architectural firm Hayball and the founder of Cities for Play, believes a big part of the challenge is “dismantling” the ideal of owning a detached house. “There’s this refrain in Australia of owning a home on a quarter-acre block but the reality is that’s already unachievable for many families. But it’s not just for affordability, it’s also because increasingly families have a desire to live in walkable suburbs close to amenity, in built-up areas, over suburbs. You only get that shared amenity with critical density.” Krysiak, who examined family living in apartments for her Churchill Fellowship, says more than 25% of apartments in Sydney are occupied by families, but “there’s still a perception apartments are a transitional housing before buying a family home”. “That mental regulatory transition hasn’t happened yet in Australia, and there’s this assumption that families with children don’t belong in apartments”. Krysiak says this has meant apartments are often not designed with families in mind, and when families do move into them, it has profound implications. “Parents might decide on having fewer children. It has an effect on parenting styles, like how much noise their child can make, or whether they can play outside, which has an effect on a child’s development.” She says family-friendly apartment designs are more common overseas, noting that in London and Toronto outdoor play space requirements are mandated. “Nowhere in Australia do we have that mandated.” “A lot of the problem in Australia is about strata rules, owners start voting against children being able to play in common outdoor areas. You can effectively ban a child from playing on property. “[Where] kids can have that communal space to play, parents can talk to each other, all of a sudden you have a community. “Allowing people to have ownership of outdoor spaces to hang up washing, leave their scooters or pram in the hallway, these things are not problems in detached dwellings.” Inês Ferreira Vaz de Sousa and Joseph Littlefield are among the growing generation of Australians who see their future in an apartment. After the birth of their son Oshy in 2020, the Sydney couple knew they had outgrown share house living, so began looking for an apartment to buy. Working in the arts industry, the pair believed a house would be financially out of reach. “The appeal of a backyard is amazing for me – when we were living in a share house, being able to take my coffee and sit in my garden in my dressing gown was really nice … But we wouldn’t have gotten into the property market any other way,” De Sousa says. Littlefield, who grew up in a townhouse as a child and had access to private outdoor spaces, says “a part of me wishes I could provide that for Oshy”. “But I have to accept [Sydney] is a different city now to the one my parents’ generation lived in.” As they searched for suitable apartments across Sydney’s inner west – where they had lived for years and had built a lifestyle – they kept an open mind about the age and style of unit. They were aware of defects in blocks such as the Opal Tower, but found many of the available apartments were in newer buildings. As they began inspections, they grew weary of newer, taller buildings. “We did look at some of the newer buildings, but when we dug a little deeper, they all had defects. They looked beautiful as apartments, but when you step back and notice five or six in the same building are being sold at the same time, and find out it’s a property developer owner suddenly having a fire sale, you realise ‘oh, there’s water damage between levels’.” The couple ultimately opted for a two-bedroom apartment in a white brick block in Dulwich Hill, built in the late 70s. There are just 12 apartments in the complex, which is split across two buildings. A big draw card was their fellow residents, many of whom were at a similar stage of life. In contrast to some of the more restrictive strata attitudes observed by Krysiak, De Sousa has found fellow owners receptive to converting their shared spaces and driveways into child-friendly play spaces. “I asked if it bothers them that Oshy is riding his bike up and down the driveway, and they said no, we love that, and joked that we’d have to put up with it when they start families. So now we are talking about building a treehouse.” De Sousa is cognisant of the drawbacks of living in a smaller apartment. But she is aware that the size of the apartment makes it difficult to consider having a second child. “It’s not that we couldn’t survive in a small space with two children, it’s just that there’s no security in our careers. If I won the lotto I’d get pregnant tomorrow”.",News/Australia news,Australian families are giving up on the suburban dream – but are new apartments up to the job? ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/12/australian-families-are-giving-up-on-the-suburban-dream-but-are-new-apartments-up-to-the-job
2/12/2022,"After almost 11 years of Coalition dominance in New South Wales, could Labor be about to mount its comeback? Saturday’s byelections in four New South Wales state electorates are likely to have wide-ranging impacts.  The worst case scenario for the premier, Dominic Perrottet, would see the state government lose its stable majority in the lower house of parliament. More likely, though, is that these byelections could set the tone for next year’s state election. The Coalition is set to become the longest-serving conservative government in modern NSW history in March, when it exceeds the 11 years it spent in power from 1965 until 1976. Only one government in the last half century has lasted more than 12 years – the last Labor government, which served from 1995-2011. Winning a fourth election is historically difficult, and Saturday’s byelections will provide valuable insights into whether the Coalition is beginning to be weighed down by history. All four byelections were triggered by the resignations of senior members of the parliament: former premier Gladys Berejiklian in the seat of Willoughby on Sydney’s north shore; former deputy premier and Nationals leader John Barilaro, from his south-eastern seat of Monaro; former transport minister Andrew Constance from his south-eastern seat of Bega; former Labor leader Jodi McKay from her inner western Sydney electorate of Strathfield. With both the government and opposition changing leaders in the past year, we don’t have much polling data to guide how Perrottet and Labor’s Chris Minns are performing, so these byelections are their first major tests. Labor is challenging the government in two of their seats: the neighbouring electorates of Bega and Monaro. Bega covers the southern NSW coast from Batemans Bay to the Victorian border, while Monaro covers inland areas between Canberra and the border, including Queanbeyan and the Snowy Mountains. Both seats are currently on healthy margins, but Monaro was Labor-held from 2003 to 2011, and Barilaro only held the seat by small margins in 2011 and 2015, before building up an 11.6% margin in 2019. Bega has been held by the Liberal party continuously since its creation in 1988, but was a marginal Liberal seat during the last Labor government, and Constance’s margin was whittled down to 6.9% in 2019. Both seats had prominent local members who were perceived to have strong personal votes, and their absence could provide an opening for Labor to win either seat. Win or lose, if Labor can gain large swings in both seats it will be seen as a strong result, with implications for the March 2023 state election. Minns will be evaluated more seriously as a potential premier, and there will be an expectation that Labor can win. For the government, the loss of either seat would make its position more precarious in the Legislative Assembly, although it should be able to serve out the remainder of this term. The government now holds 46 of the 93 seats, including those up for election tomorrow, plus two ex-Liberal independents who reliably vote with the government. The loss of two seats would see their working majority lost, although they would have a number of options on the crossbench to find the missing vote when needed. Labor is also defending the electorate of Strathfield, where McKay’s resignation opened up a seat that Labor lost in 2011 before regaining in 2015. Labor holds Strathfield by just 5%, and is facing a challenge from the Liberal party. If Labor is in a stronger position in New South Wales you’d expect them to comfortably win here, but the seat is marginal and both parties are taking it seriously. Labor is also facing a challenge from former Sydney Morning Herald columnist Elizabeth Farrelly, who was briefly a Labor member before resigning to contest the seat as an independent. Farrelly is not recommending preferences to Labor despite her recent political history, and may peel votes off both major parties. Willoughby would traditionally be considered a safe Liberal seat, and Labor is sitting out this contest accordingly. Independents have been popping up all over northern Sydney recently to contest the upcoming federal election, and there is an independent candidate running a similar campaign in Willoughby. This seat will most likely stay in Liberal hands, but it will be worth watching. In the absence of detailed polling, these results will likely shape public perceptions of how next year’s state election is likely to turn out. If Labor wins Bega or Monaro, the Coalition government will look shaky and be in a weak position heading in to next year. If Labor gains substantial swings but does not gain seats, it will still suggest that the next election will be competitive and that either side could win. Beyond perceptions, a change in any of these seats will have a practical impact on the next election. Labor needs to gain 10 seats to win a majority – a gain in Bega or Monaro reduces the task for next March. The Coalition won 48 seats in 2019 and lost a seat to a redistribution. They need to hold all the seats they now hold to regain a majority. Losing Bega or Monaro means they need to make gains to win a majority. Don’t expect a result to be called quickly, however. The NSW electoral commission has taken the unprecedented step of sending postal ballots to every voter. This appears to have reduced the traditional late surge in pre-poll voting and may well slow down the calling of the results, with postal votes not due to be counted until next week.

2/12/2022,"If you’re anything like me, you probably have a bunch of hard drives sitting at the back of a seldom-used drawer somewhere in your home. They likely contain an assortment of photos and videos, important (and not-so-important) documents, old laptop back-ups, and music, TV and movie files. Maybe you intend to sort through them, keeping the good stuff and discarding the chaff. But perhaps that exercise feels a bit boring and overwhelming, so it keeps being relegated to the endless tomorrow.  You may feel comfortable that your data is safe on those hard drives until you get around to them, but if it’s been years since you last pulled them out, time may be passing faster than you think. Unlike film, records, cassettes and CDs, hard drives have a lifespan of only three to five years – maybe 10 at the most – so it’s probably time to think about how to preserve that data over the long run. Data storage has changed a lot in the past decade, so I asked for advice from Mohiuddin Ahmed, a lecturer in computing and security at Edith Cowan University, and Adnene Guabtni, a senior research engineer at CSIRO’s Data61. Here’s what they told me. Ahmed says the best storage option depends on your definition and usage of personal data. For example, he doesn’t consider documents such as passports, licences and health records “personal” because the government and various organisations already hold copies of them. What he does consider personal are family photos. If you’re only storing documents, you will need a lot less space than you do for media files and you should tailor your solutions accordingly. “When I got my first computer my dad bought me a 20MB hard disk drive,” Ahmed says. “But now I have to use at least two 10TB hard drives, because we are seeing an explosion of data. “If you’re someone who likes to shoot a lot of photos, videos and whatnot, then yes, probably every 10 years, you’ll have to buy a bigger drive.” Ten years ago hard disk drives (HDDs) were the state-of-the-art technology. Since then, costs have dropped and capacity has increased, meaning they are still a solid option. But while they are still widely used, solid state drives (SSDs) are more robust, quicker to transfer data, last longer – and are correspondingly more expensive. HDDs have spinning disks, where data is stored magnetically. “Obviously, anything that has mechanical components can fail – the disk can be scratched if it has a bump, anything can impact it,” Guabtni says. “Plus, anything magnetic is not going to last forever. [SSDs] don’t use magnetic disks, there are no rotating parts. Instead [the data] is written on electronic components, which makes it a bit more robust.” For Ahmed, this is where your data strategy comes back into play. If you have large files you are constantly transferring, speed is going to be an issue and the extra cost will be worth it. “My two cents is to go for the expensive solid state drive now because in the end it will last longer, and you’ll have a faster response time and be more secure.” But regardless of whether you choose HDD or SSD, both have a limited life. Cloud storage is now ubiquitous and you can usually find some level of free storage with services such as Google, Apple, Dropbox and so on. But at some point you will reach the limit of the free tier and will have to pay – usually an ongoing cost. Again, how much you pay will depend on the size of your data. Of course, cloud providers also store data on drives but, as Guabtni points out, the difference is they typically rely on a very well-secured data centre where the environment is stable, the hardware is upgraded and constantly maintained, and your data is replicated multiple times making it harder to lose. Then the only concern is privacy. “If you use cloud services to store your personal data and you set your password as 123456, that’s worse than storing it on hard disk drives,” Ahmed says. “You have to use strong passwords and multifactor authentication if you really want to save your personal data in the cloud. “But when it is hacked, when the systems are compromised, you can’t really get back your private data. So there are pros and cons with each of those.” Again, Ahmed says it comes down to what you want to do with your data. “Are you trying to be secure, or are you trying to be more flexible and more computationally efficient with your data?” “I know this is going to be tedious,” Ahmed says. “But if you really care about your data you should always have at least two backups – at least two. So basically, you plug into your computer and copy to two drives rather than one.” To be extra safe, you should store your backups in different locations if you can. I have a friend who had his backup hard drive stolen along with his laptop, leading to the upsetting loss of years’ worth of photos. Fires and floods can lead to the same outcome. If you’re really serious about data hygiene, you could follow the example of Ahmed, who each week checks the data stored in his various cloud services and transfers the essentials to at least two backup drives. “Who knows what might get damaged?” he says. “If you have a toddler in your house, anything can happen.”",News/Technology,Most hard drives have a lifespan of three to five years.

2/12/2022,"The Foreign Office has issued new guidance advising British citizens in Ukraine to leave now while commercial means are still available, amid increasing concern of an invasion by Russia. On Thursday Biden urged all US citizens to leave, saying “things could go crazy very quickly”.  The US president also announced emergency military plans to airlift Americans who had fled Ukraine into Poland, in an effort to avoid the kind of evacuation fiasco that occurred in Kabul last summer. British sources said the UK was not preparing an emergency airlift as there were ample commercial flights operating daily and the land border with Poland was open. It is thought the number of British citizens in Ukraine is in the low thousands. Many have strong ties there and are unlikely to leave. The Foreign Office said in a statement: “The safety and security of British nationals is our top priority, which is why we have updated our travel advice. We urge British nationals in Ukraine to leave now via commercial means while they remain available.” It added that it urged “those British people who choose to remain in Ukraine [to] keep their departure plans under constant review, and ensure their travel documents are up to date”. It also warned: “British nationals should not expect consular support or help with evacuating in the event of a Russian military incursion.” The UK is likely to reduce the size of its embassy staffing for a second time. It already advises British citizens against any travel to two Russian-backed regions, Donetsk and Luhansk, in the east of the country. It comes as UK government sources said the Foreign Office was preparing to launch a crisis team to deal with escalating tensions in Ukraine. Keen to avoid a repeat of the chaotic response to Afghanistan’s takeover by the Taliban, FCDO officials are understood to be revising plans for how to respond if war breaks out in eastern Europe. Multiple sources said the FCDO was preparing to launch a gold/silver/bronze structure that could be ready within days to tackle major incidents. The chain of command is employed in crisis situations, such as the evacuation from Kabul and repatriations when the Covid pandemic began, and would mean civil servants are designated strategic, tactical and operational roles. The FCDO said it was not in crisis mode and the gold/silver/bronze structure had not yet been set up. A spokesperson said: “The emerging situation in and around Ukraine is a top priority for the FCDO and, as everyone would expect, we have robust contingency plans in place to respond to any developments.” On Thursday, Boris Johnson told a group of western countries and Nato in a virtual meeting that “he feared for the security of Europe in the current circumstances”. The prime minister said that “allies needed to continue with efforts to reinforce and support the eastern frontiers of Nato”. UK officials insisted the government was not acting on a specific piece of new intelligence suggesting a Russian invasion was imminent, or because the US had acted so decisively. Officials said the UK travel advice had been kept under constant review and was issued independently of any other country. But the British government has said the Russian military exercises under way in Belarus, put alongside the Russian naval manoeuvres in the Black Sea, represent potentially the riskiest moment since the crisis began. The UK, like other European powers, has been under conflicting pressures since the Kyiv government indicated it would like western politicians to tone down the sense of imminent conflict, as it was damaging the Ukrainian economy. Germany and France have been less ready to predict an imminent Russian invasion, even though they are receiving the same intelligence as the UK and US. The UK stressed that numerous diplomatic avenues to head off conflict were still open, despite the tensions at a meeting between the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, on Thursday. On Thursday diplomatic talks in Berlin involving Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France, designed to promote a degree of autonomy for the Russia-supporting eastern provinces in Ukraine, broke up with no agreement after eight hours. It is expected that the four countries will hold further talks next month. Separately, papers are still being exchanged between the US, Nato and Russia about Moscow’s broader demand for a change in the European security architecture.",News/UK news,Foreign Office tells Britons in Ukraine to leave country now,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/11/foreign-office-urges-uk-citizens-ukraine-leave-as-soon-as-possible
2/12/2022,"Russia’s defence minister has described levels of cooperation with Britain as “close to zero” and in danger of going into “negative” territory as he received the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, in Moscow for talks meant to de-escalate tensions with the west. Sergei Shoigu began his meeting with Wallace by attacking the UK’s deliveries of lethal arms and military trainers to Ukraine, which Wallace claims would only be useful for defence in case of a potential invasion.  “I would like to see the reason why the United Kingdom is sending special forces to Ukraine and until when [they] will be there,” Shoigu said. The talks on Friday marked a second round of British-Russian diplomacy following the foreign secretary Liz Truss’ meeting with her Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, who complained that the talks resembled a discussion of the “mute with the deaf”. By contrast, Wallace sought to emphasise the professional nature of Friday’s meeting with Shoigu, where he warned Russia about the “tragic” consequences of an offensive in Ukraine and said he had received Moscow’s assurances that it was not planning to launch an invasion. “Shoigu is a professional and very experienced minister,” Wallace said following the “frank and constructive” talks. “When they say they aren’t going to invade Ukraine we take it seriously but look at the actions that accompany it.” Wallace said he had not seen signs yet of a de-escalation by the Kremlin, pointing to Russia’s deployment of more than half of its offensive military forces near the border and saying the country is in position to launch a large offensive into Ukraine if it decides to. But he also said he sought to “address some of the issues raised in Russia’s draft treaty”, a document published by its foreign ministry that includes demands that Nato remove its infrastructure from eastern Europe and publicly pledge not to admit Ukraine into the military alliance. “We can try and move on to where we can resolve our issues together through diplomacy, through other actions, and through confidence-building measures,” he said he told Shoigu during meeting. Asked to evaluate the level of relations following the meeting, Wallace said they were “above zero”. Wallace also defended British deliveries of arms, including antitank missiles to Ukraine, saying they were useful only for defensive purposes and that British military trainers would return to the UK “pretty soon”. Wallace and Shoigu were pictured shaking hands under a portrait of allied military leaders following the taking of the Reichstag in 1945. The two men also exchanged gifts. Wallace received a plaque from an Arctic convoy ship and Shoigu a ceremonial sword. Western intelligence agencies increasingly believe that Vladimir Putin has now put in place enough troops to attempt an invasion, a sentiment reflected in warnings in the last 24 hours from both Joe Biden and Boris Johnson. Nevertheless, they continue to believe no final decision by the Russian leader has been made. A number of invasion scenarios are considered possible, but there is a prevailing belief that any military intervention ordered by Putin would be designed to achieve regime change in Kyiv. That could see a lightning attack, aimed at encircling the capital, with the intention of forcing the collapse of Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s government, and trying to install a pro-Russian regime without urban warfare. Johnson emphasised on Thursday that any invasion would amount to a massive miscalculation by Putin because Ukraine would “fight and they will resist very strongly”. Any belief in the Kremlin that a Russian intervention would be welcome by anything other than a tiny minority was mistaken, British ministers said. On Thursday, representatives of Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany met in Berlin, to try to hash out a roadmap towards implementing the Minsk accords, signed in 2015 to bring an end to the active phase of conflict. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has made resurrecting the Minsk deal the key plank of his diplomatic attempts to avoid Russian military action and he pushed the idea during his visits to Moscow and Kyiv earlier this week. While Zelenskiy has publicly backed the accord, in private Ukrainian officials say fulfilling it would be politically impossible given public opinion in Ukraine, and would give Moscow a permanent say in the country’s politics. After nine hours of talks, the sides broke up close to midnight having failed to sign any kind of joint document, merely agreeing to keep dialogue going. Russia’s representative at the talks, Dmitry Kozak, said the “key disagreement” was that Kyiv refused to open direct negotiations with representatives of the breakaway territories. Ukraine believes that doing so would legitimise what are in effect Russian puppet regimes. Kozak accused Kyiv of sabotaging the talks. “A negative result is still a result, we now have full clarity about what the statements of different politicians about adhering to the Minsk agreements mean,” Kozak said on Friday.",News/World news,"Cooperation between UK and Russia ‘close to zero’, Wallace told by Kremlin",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/11/cooperation-between-uk-and-russia-close-to-zero-wallace-told-by-kremlin
2/12/2022,"Dame Cressida Dick had barely departed as boss of Britain’s largest police force before Downing Street was making veiled threats that her successor ought to go easy on Boris Johnson in Scotland Yard’s “partygate” investigation. On Friday, No 10 let it be known that the Metropolitan police would need to be “very certain” that the prime minister breached lockdown rules before issuing him with a fixed penalty notice – a fine that would probably trigger a vote of confidence in Mr Johnson’s leadership. “There is inevitably a degree of discretion here,” a senior ally of the prime minister told the Times. “If [Mr Johnson] does get one it would be odd if the discretionary action of the police determines the future of the country.” Anyone seeking to be the next Met police commissioner would have got the message: this is politics, use your “discretion” and keep your nose out of it.  It is Mr Johnson who should stay out of the appointment process entirely, as he is the subject of a Met investigation. Britain’s model of “policing by consent” is based on the idea that the police maintain an impartial rule of law independent of governments or parties. To ensure that the next Met police chief can command public confidence, there are a number of steps that should be taken. First, there should be a shortlist of candidates published so that ministers cannot parachute a surprise political ally into the job. After he or she is installed in Scotland Yard, MPs and the Greater London Assembly must be allowed to quiz the new Met chief and be satisfied that the partygate investigation remains a priority, free from political meddling. If an interim commissioner takes over, then they too must be able to give the public assurance that this is the case. The new Met chief will be appointed by Priti Patel, Mr Johnson’s home secretary, after consulting the Labour mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. Whoever it is must have the backing of both. Dame Cressida seems to have jumped before she was pushed. She appeared unable to produce a plan that satisfied Mr Khan’s insistence that the Met tackle a racist, misogynistic and homophobic culture and recover the trust of Londoners. Ms Patel, who last year lost the confidence of rank-and-file officers over pay restraint, says she wants someone to tackle violent crime. Dame Cressida appeared to have the support of Mr Johnson. Last year the official report into the Daniel Morgan murder had accused the Met boss of being personally obstructive and her force of being institutionally corrupt. Despite such a finding, the commissioner received Mr Johnson’s endorsement last October for a two-year extension to her time in office. She seemed untouchable during the weeks when she refused to investigate reports of parties in Downing Street in the middle of the pandemic lockdowns. Police now say this was because nobody admitted to taking part. The writing may have been on the wall for Dame Cressida when the Met announced an inquiry into partygate last month – though officers insisted the full report into the parties by Sue Gray, a civil servant, would not be published until their work was over. The prime minister’s calculation now seems to be that if he can dodge a penalty notice, he can ride out the storm of public anger over there being one rule for him and another for everyone else. Mr Johnson no doubt thinks that even if the full Gray report is published – and makes it obvious that he ought to have been fined – the moment of danger would have passed. However, for the new Met chief it would have only just begun.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Boris Johnson and the police: stop meddling in partygate | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/11/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnson-and-the-police-stop-meddling-in-partygate
2/12/2022,"The line is there to be crossed in this engrossing, unnerving but unexpectedly sympathetic drama of family dysfunction from French-Swiss film-maker Ursula Meier who made her memorable debut back in 2008 with the eco-parable Home, starring a particularly intransigent Isabelle Huppert. Meier has a knack of creating overwhelming mothers: Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi is on very imperious and distrait form as Christina, a former classical concert pianist who abandoned her career for her family and never let her three daughters forget it – finally becoming a demanding music teacher who also appears to have taken her oldest child as a pupil. This is Margaret (Stéphanie Blanchoud) who is a talented pop musician, singer and guitarist with a thriving local following. Maybe Margaret owes some of her success to her impossible mother and maybe she doesn’t. But her explosive temper is worsened by any contact with her mum and the film begins with a spectacular, violent fight in slo-mo in front of her aghast sisters Louise (India Hair) and Marion (Elli Spagnolo), accompanied by some of the tasteful classical music that has helped drive Margaret over the edge. It’s caused by … what? Everything and nothing. It’s been building her whole life. But Margaret gives her mother a slap to the side of the head which gives Christina tinnitus – what she describes as a continuous high B-flat in her head.  Nobody’s pressing charges but Margaret is served with a restraining order: she cannot go within 100 metres of her mother, a restriction which Marion enforces by solemnly painting a blue line around their property. So Christine, tormented by her pain and her toxic anger, haunts this line, this limit of her behaviour, even bringing out her electric guitar so that she can help Marion practise her solo singing. (She too has inherited her mother’s musical talent.) All of these characters start the film as hardly more than caricature; people in the shadow of this strange and rather shocking act of violence. But as Margaret’s cuts and bruises fade so does the emotional temperature, and the three women emerge as fully rounded and even rather likable people. Even Christina, once she has got rid of the baby grand piano that dominated the family living room, becomes a bit easier to live with. It could be that La Ligne will become part of that distinct film tradition – alongside movies such as Bob Rafelson’s Five Easy Pieces, James Toback’s Fingers and Michael Haneke’s The Piano Teacher – which is about the cost of seriously studying music, about the pain that is a toxic, unacknowledged byproduct. It also has very good performances from Blanchoud and Bruni-Tedeschi.  La Ligne (The Line) screened at the Berlin film festival.",Arts/Film,La Ligne (The Line) review – bruising family drama with likeable outcome,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/11/la-ligne-the-line-review-bruising-ursula-meier
