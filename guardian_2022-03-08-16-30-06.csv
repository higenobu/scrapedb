3/8/2022,"It’s my first walk after Covid. Here in Scotland, we still have to self-isolate for 10 days, and because I live with a GP husband and a lodger, that meant sticking to a couple of rooms and only sneaking down to the kitchen with mask and disinfectant spray when they were out. I even stopped patting the dog. On my last walk before my positive test, the strath was deep in snow, every tree cloaked in white, the forest silent. Now that I’m out again, the world is transformed. Scraps of snow still linger on the hills, but the valley is clear. Today the sun beams from its pale-blue sky and the cohorts of clouds look too lazy to do very much. Though still only 5C, the air feels fresh and light on my housebound skin. I never lost my sense of smell, so I bask in the fragrances of soil and trees again, of the earth opening. Most of the forest near me is deciduous; the aspens, birches and oaks hold all their new life in tight fists, skeleton limbs stark against the sky. But the birds! The difference in a fortnight is striking, as though they all found their voices when I lost mine. The tracery of branches quivers with them, flitting and bobbing, twittering, calling, piping and singing. Here are all the tits, tiny but insistent, the chaffinches with their downward tumble of notes, the corvids still quarrelling and ruffling feathers, and a lovely mistle thrush, singing its heart out. Doves flute, gulls carry the sea in their cries and a high buzzard pierces the blue. Somewhere, a hidden woodpecker drums along. Down at the marsh, the water’s edge is fringed with delicate ice patterns, suspended in the rushes just above the surface. Beyond, a half-frozen slush melts back to water and further still, two swans are feeding, their long necks slipping down into the dark and rising again in graceful curves. All of it catches the sunlight – the ice and water, the wet grass, the swan feathers – and tosses it back, shining. I am blessed beyond measure to have come through Covid so easily, to be alive and free in a time of troubles, to hear the world sing on a day like this. Praise be.

3/8/2022,"Christine Turner remembers one of the first lynching postcards she ever saw – but it wasn’t the horrific burnt corpse of Will Stanley in Temple, Texas, in 1915 depicted on the front that stayed with her most. It was the chilling note handwritten on the back: “This is the barbecue we had last night,” it reads, ending with the sign-off, “your son, Joe”. “That was the thing that was seared in my mind and that I’ll never forget,” says the Brooklyn-based film-maker. “There was such a casual nature about the postcard. This young man was sharing with his parents something that he took part in that he was proud of. It’s that sense that this is almost a normal activity to partake in that was most disturbing.” Turner’s documentary short Lynching Postcards: Token of a Great Day uncovers a sobering trove of 19th- and 20th-century souvenir postcards commemorating lynchings of African Americans, exposing yet another little-known facet of the vile, ongoing history of racism in America. More than 4,400 racial-terror lynchings occurred in the US between Reconstruction and the second world war, according to the Equal Justice Initiative, and as the film demonstrates, many were staged by white mobs as public events akin to carnivals or picnics. The film, released late last year and shortlisted for this year’s best documentary short Oscar, is a timely one: just last week the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a historic bill that would make lynching a hate crime punishable by up to 30 years in prison. The passage of the bill – named for Emmett Till, the Black 14-year-old who in 1955 was murdered in Mississippi – followed more than a century of stalled attempts. Turner, who began work on the short following the 2020 murder of George Floyd, had come across the postcards first around the release of James Allen’s 1999 book Without Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in America and later while working as an archival researcher on documentaries like Amend, released by Netflix last year. “I’m interested in telling unexpected or lesser- and under-explored stories of the past and the present,” says Turner, who also directed 2013’s Homegoings, an acclaimed feature about African American funeral traditions. “I knew that this would make for a really powerful story and be something a lot of people wouldn’t be familiar with.” Lynching Postcards, in its depiction of violence, treads the delicate line between unflinching and gratuitous, and Turner admits it’s a challenging watch, albeit a necessary one: “It’s not a feelgood movie. The images are so difficult to look at, but in order to understand the present moment, we have to grapple with our history, and we have to confront the ugly parts.” It’s undoubtedly a dark topic, but Turner was determined to also tell a story of Black resistance: Black activists like those at the NAACP used the postcards to mount an awareness campaign showing the horrors of lynching to the world. “I didn’t want to simply make another film about black victimization,” she says firmly. “Anti-lynching activists subverted the postcards’ original intent, transforming and utilizing them as evidence to end the practice of lynching. Those stories of black resistance often get lost in our history.” Photography has long been a powerful tool for exposing injustice, she adds; think of Emmett Till, the images from whose funeral sparked the civil rights movement, up through Eric Garner in more recent times. The process of viewing dozens of harrowing postcards – many drawn from the collections of Atlanta’s National Center for Civil and Human Rights as well as the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture – was no easy task. “I should have probably been meditating or something,” Turner laughs. She relied on discussions with colleagues and friends “that helped remind myself why I was doing it in those challenging, all-consuming moments”. (And as a mother of a two-year-old, she made a point to keep him away from the disturbing images on her desk.) The subject of lynching has received more attention in recent years, with the 2018 opening of the National Memorial for Peace and Justice and Howardena Pindell’s 2020 video Rope/Fire/Water. But Turner declines to say that it’s having a cultural moment: “The question is which people are more receptive to hearing these stories,” she says. “As a result of our national reckoning on race, many people are more open to receiving these histories than they otherwise would have been. But we’ve yet to pass a federal anti-lynching bill, and there is still a huge movement to erase our history altogether with this attack on critical race theory. It’s one step forward, two steps back.” But the film-maker emphasizes the parallels between the story of Lynching Postcards and the murder of Ahmaud Arbery, for example. “There are many what people refer to as modern-day lynchings that may cause some people to take our history of lynching more seriously,” she says. In terms of audience reactions, “a lot of people are horrified by the imagery and completely unfamiliar with the story and say that they can’t believe that this happened,” Turner says. “And they’re referring to not just the postcards but the public-spectacle aspect of so many of these lynchings. We tend to think that these lynchings are more private affairs or spontaneous events where a group of men runs into the woods. These were planned events, with food and concessions. You bring your kids and maybe travel from afar to attend. And that’s surprising to people.” While many Black viewers have told Turner they weren’t aware of these objects, others may know them all too well. “The postcards were mementoes and prideful souvenirs for white people, but they also served as a message, a warning sign, to Black people. They were a proclamation, a way to reinforce white supremacy and keep Black people in their place. So Black people who lived in these communities where lynchings had taken place and where these postcards were created would be well aware of the history.” Ultimately she hopes the film prompts reflection on the country’s history, echoing the film’s final, chilling words taken from the postcard of someone who attended a lynching and asked the recipient’s opinion of it: “I don’t care, do you?” “That was me speaking to the audience,” Turner says. “I’m throwing that question back at viewers.” Lynching Postcards: Token of a Great Day screens for free at Film Forum in New York City on 8 March (followed by a Q&A with the director) and is available to stream on Paramount+",Arts/Film,Lynching Postcards: a harrowing documentary about confronting history,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/08/lynching-postcards-a-harrowing-documentary-about-confronting-history
3/8/2022,"On Wednesday, my therapist set me a task: to record every time I logged on to Twitter, what I posted, and how I felt in the process. This embarrassing piece of homework was in response to an impassioned rant I’d embarked on, during our session. “Everyone just keeps trumpeting their opinions like they know anything,” I said, pausing before admitting that my anger was also drawn from frustration at my own posting behaviour. “Why can’t I stop wading in?” It’s a question I think many will be asking themselves. As Russian tanks began to roll across Ukrainian borders, so too began the real-time reactions. It was to be expected; for the roughly 53 million social media users in the UK, it is hardly unfamiliar in 2022 to see reality filtered through Twitter timelines and Instagram feeds. Despite what some have claimed, the conflict is not even close to being the “first social media war” . But it is the first of this scale on the back doorstep of the west. For many millions in the UK, the war feels closer to home, both in terms of geography and the online spaces they inhabit, a fact disappointingly evidenced by broadcasters drawing oafish comparisons between the shock of combat in “civilised” Europe v conflicts in the “developing world”. This has played out online in an onslaught of opinions and infographics. Surreal moments of well-meaning intervention have occurred, such as popstar Dua Lipa entreating her nearly 80 million Instagram followers to donate to the Ukrainian army. Elsewhere, social media users have held forth on everything from whether nuclear weapons would totally or partly destroy the human race, to the role of astrology in current events. On social media, to be silent is to be found wanting. Despite the different registers of specific platforms (Instagram, for example, is all earnest “awareness”, whereas TikTok is laced with a frenetic, theatre-kid energy), all of them depend on compelling users to actively produce and engage with content. In times of crisis, this demand – baked into code in order to ensure profit for tech bosses – has found itself expressed as a moral obligation. In the case of Ukraine, to visibly engage and express solidarity is viewed as akin to enacting it through practical, tangible action. We are not looking away. We are analysing, boosting and amplifying. We are posting through it. In times of shared distress, people have always coalesced to engage in a collective exercise in sense-making. But the problem is, the online spaces where we gather now are not ones that encourage measured conversations, or the admission that we know little, or maybe nothing at all. Instead, social media platforms are built around the cult of the individual, where knowledge is always delivered in a tone of utmost authority. Counter-knowledge is proffered combatively. The picture in Ukraine doesn’t seem much clearer, but the chatter of social media is a cacophony. People want to be plugged in: this week’s huge jump in viewership for BBC “heavyweight” political offerings such as Newsnight demonstrate that. But many of us have also become conditioned to post our thought processes, analysis and reactions as a stream of consciousness, on platforms where everything – technically – is treated with the same import and weight. Often in these spaces, the overwhelming nature of the information we are bombarded with flattens into a focus on smaller, more accessible details, resulting in pedantic debates about military capacity and so on. There’s a tendency to view the conflict through the lens of our pre-existing disputes (see: bizarre claims about the west’s failure to confront Russia being caused in part because it has been distracted by pronouns). In the cold light of day, all this seems monumentally narrow and grubby. It’s not that these social feeds haven’t resulted in materially useful outcomes. The mobilisation of global Black communities, led by Black British women, not only alerted the general public to horrific racism being faced by Black and Brown students attempting to flee Ukraine, but also provided practical financial support for those who remain trapped. Verified donation schemes have been able to tap into ready-made audiences, primed and eager to help. Slowly, mass outrage at brazen government refusal to aid refugees from the region is chipping away at the Home Office’s determination not to waive visa recommendations. When social media meets specific organisational goals that can be translated into practical action, then we see worthwhile results. Too often, however, that truth is forgotten or pushed aside in the heady rush to post our way out of powerlessness. Isn’t that it? What is happening in Ukraine – as is what is happening in the likes of Palestine and Tigray, and all the regions where conflict rages – exposes our individual helplessness. It is a shock to be reminded of your own personal impotence in the face of geopolitical forces. Turning to the internet, where your voice echoes loudly once more, and a reshare is trumpeted as a quick solution to the distress, is a balm. But it’s a fleeting feeling of catharsis. Closing Twitter after a long day of sharing opinions leaves me spent, and often angry, but no closer to feeling as if I’ve made any real difference. The solution is, of course, one that’s existed for aeons: engage in the unshowy, sustainable work of collective organising. Pulling together donations for refugees. Fundraising. Mounting further pressure on the Home Office to immediately waive visa requirements. None of that precludes posting on social media, especially if you really do know what you’re talking about. But I’m not convinced that many of us do, to be honest. It’s a lesson in humility and forgoing the short-lived fix. I think the annals of history can survive this round without my take.

I’d have to check with Alice Aldridge and her engineering degree to get this right, but as applied to her own situation, I’d say that this broadly translates as: if things seem to be going pretty well, it’s only a matter of time before the gods of Ambridge retaliate with equal and opposite disaster. Just when she was six months sober and coping nicely with baby Martha, her ex, Chris, and her best friend, Amy, had a one-night stand – heralded by the immortal morning-after line, “Can you pass my bra?” When Alice finds out, she’ll relapse, mark my words, and the divorce will get ugly, and it’ll go to court, and Chris will get a massive chunk of Home Farm, and the Fall of the House of Aldridge will be complete. Oh Alice. You should leave Ambridge. Still, one should be careful what one wishes for. Phoebe’s off, having got herself a job in the Highlands, something to do with microalgae.

3/8/2022,"Iread this book, which is a thoughtful critique but ultimately a stalwart defence of liberalism, as Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, and it felt urgent and timely. Vladimir Putin, as Francis Fukuyama reminds us, has declared liberal democracy “obsolete”. His is not an uncommon opinion, even in liberal democracies. Thirty years ago, following the inglorious collapse of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact, Fukuyama gained international recognition for his book entitled The End of History and the Last Man. It argued that liberal democracy was essentially “the end point of mankind’s ideological evolution”. As events such as 9/11, the Afghan and Iraq wars and the 2008 financial crisis took their toll on liberalism’s self-confidence, Fukuyama’s work was denounced as the height of Hegelian hubris. He was seen as a naive believer in the inevitability of a western-defined idea of progress, and as someone who was blind to liberal democracy’s failings. In some respects, the criticisms were unfair, or at least aimed at arguments he never made. But there seems little doubt that Fukuyama has had to eat rather a lot of humble pie. As he writes: “It’s clear liberalism has been in retreat in recent years.”In that time, Fukuyama has backed away from the American neoconservative agenda that he had initially supported, and has watched as authoritarian leaders such as Putin, China’s Xi and Turkey’s Erdoğan laid claim to the world stage. He cites sobering statistics that political rights and civil liberties have been falling for the past 15 years around the world, having risen for the previous three and a half decades. On top of all that, rightwing populists and leftwing progressives have made significant inroads into western politics. Following Donald Trump’s attack on democracy, and Britain’s rejection of European-style liberalism, the US and UK still adhere to liberal democracy, but it’s not exactly a political and economic system in which its beneficiaries feel much pride. The first difficulty when it comes to rousing the liberal spirit is that liberalism is famously difficult to define. It has become one of those words that mean different things to different political groupings. A vital strength of this slim, elegant book is that it is crystalline in its definitions, even while acknowledging the complexities of practice. Although liberalism is under attack from both left and right, it is from the left that the more serious intellectual challenge comes. Fukuyama recognises this fact and attempts to address the left’s criticism. Essentially a system that is founded on the principle of equality of individual rights, law and freedom has evolved rather conspicuous inequalities in each of those realms. The most glaring are the economic inequalities that have grown in the west, particularly in the US and UK, over the past 40 years. Fukuyama attributes these to “neoliberalism”, the belief in unfettered markets as the means of delivering the goal of consumer welfare. But, Fukuyama contends, this is a distortion of liberalism, which has a much larger social remit than simply economic efficiency. It’s not just a question of regulating and limiting big business – although Fukuyama argues for both – but of appreciating the social capital that attains from redistribution and narrowing of inequalities. At times the former adviser to the Reagan administration can sound like a Scandinavian social democrat. Almost. Nonetheless the postmodern left maintain that inequalities and injustice are not a malfunction of liberalism but instead a manifestation of structural power built in at a foundational level. His exegesis of critical theory from Marcuse through to Foucault, and how it has been widely adopted as a tool of sociopolitical analysis, is a brilliantly acute summary of the way some aspects of liberal thought have consumed themselves. The pursuit of individual autonomy or “self-actualisation”, for example, has become mired in an identity politics that subsumes the individual into rigidly defined groupings based on ethnicity, gender or sexuality. In a way, argues Fukuyama, this is a necessary step to address structural inequalities and counteract the misplaced notion that the individual is the only unit of social importance. Taken to its extreme, however, this kind of analysis offers no liberation, but the revelation of ever deeper layers of oppression, in which individual thought is an illusion, and all intellectual interaction is subject to the power dynamics of group hierarchies. Everything, by way of this understanding, including empirical science, becomes a social construct designed to benefit the powerful. As Fukuyama notes, it’s a form of conspiratorial thinking that has been duly adopted by the right, who saw measures enacted during the pandemic – mask wearing, vaccination and social-distancing – as signs of a hidden power elite. Although he outlines some familiar complaints about social media monopolies and their baleful effect on political discourse, the overall sense you gain from this book is that liberalism is in crisis because of the complacency that set in with its successes. Liberal democracy has delivered on many fronts, but with each step forward it left many constituencies behind. Its opponents like to speak of the “Tina” – there is no alternative – way of thinking as a liberal democratic shibboleth that must be exposed. And so it must. There are alternatives – as the likes of Putin, Xi and their imitators conspicuously demonstrate. They’re just not good ones. However, liberalism cannot afford to rely on the flaws of its antagonists. It needs to refresh, re-evaluate and rethink. This book does not supply all, or enough, of the answers. But it’s a good place to start with asking the essential questions.  Liberalism and Its Discontents by Francis Fukuyama is published by Profile (£16.99).

3/8/2022,"The juror in Ghislaine Maxwell’s trial who apparently did not disclose childhood sexual abuse during jury selection is scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday morning for public questioning. Juror no 50, whose name is Scotty David, might receive immunity, which would require that he answer Judge Alison Nathan’s questions about his failure to disclose said abuse. Maxwell was convicted on 29 December of sex-trafficking and related charges for procuring girls – some aged just 14 – for the late financier Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse. Maxwell has maintained her innocence. Epstein, a convicted sex offender who once counted global elites such as Britain’s Prince Andrew among his associates, was arrested in July 2019 for sex trafficking. He killed himself in a New York City federal jail about one month after his arrest. Maxwell’s conviction was thrown into potential disarray days after her trial concluded. David claimed in post-trial media interviews that he had been sexually abused as a child and said that he told other jurors about this abuse, which helped them see things from a victim’s perspective. David’s comments prompted controversy as potential jurors completed questionnaires during the screening process, which directly asked about past abuse. One questions stated: “Have you or a friend ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?” Following David’s comments in the media, prosecutors asked Nathan for an inquiry into his statements. Maxwell’s lawyers quickly joined in asking for such an inquiry and have since been pushing for a mistrial, arguing that David’s failure to disclose past abuse deprived her of a fair, impartial jury. David’s completed questionnaire was released during legal exchanges on this controversy. The document revealed that he had marked the no box in response to the abuse query. While it is unlikely that Maxwell will be retried, the fact remains that it is a possibility. Veteran attorneys told the Guardian that would hinge on David’s explanation for his failure to disclose. An accidental omission poses less of a potential for retrial. However, if David intentionally withheld that information, the possibility is higher.",News/US news,Juror at centre of Ghislaine Maxwell trial controversy to go before judge,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/08/juror-ghislaine-maxwell-trial-judge-court-hearing

3/8/2022,"It’s International Women’s Day, so of course I find myself reflecting not on the plight of women, but on what I was up to on all previous IWDs. In the 90s, we celebrated it in pubs, because whether or not real women drank pints was one of feminism’s critical questions back then. I’m not kidding. It’s not even a stupid question – but we can talk about why not some other time. Most of the 00s was lost to arguing on social media about why there wasn’t an International Men’s Day (ignoring the boring reality that it’s on 19 November), or whether that was every other day of the year. Then, on what has lodged in my memory as aeons before the pandemic, but was actually the blink of an eye ahead of the first lockdown, I went to Berlin for a panel discussion about what a feminist Europe would look like. The question made me miserable. We had been wading through the toxic sludge of Brexit for nearly four years, and we had just elected a government of rightwing shysters. Even if we did come up with a blueprint for an international feminist utopia, Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage would between them probably find a way to yank the UK out of it. Plus, you almost never see a new idea spawned during a panel discussion in real time. You would be more likely to see a scientific breakthrough on Ready Steady Cook. That was my prejudice; turned out that was just because most panels don’t contain enough feminists. So anyway, I can’t remember whose idea this was, between Saboura Naqshband, an academic and co-founder of the Berlin Muslim Feminists Collective, Daphne Büllesbach, vice-president of European Alternatives Berlin, or Prune Antoine, editor-in-chief of Sisters of Europe. All I can say for certain is that it wasn’t my idea. I’d arrived with nothing in my head besides goodwill and the aforesaid misery. It sounds pretty simple in retrospect. There were four basic questions. What were the origins of the women’s movement? Universal suffrage. What was its international evolution? As women’s voting rights were established, it became a Peace, Land and Bread movement, and still has the campaign against poverty and conflict at its core. What are the pressing issues now? Still poverty and conflict, the displacements they both cause, plus the democratic deficits that land us with the authoritarian governments that create them. How could we loop all that together? With a new suffrage movement for the 21st century, except not for women – many of us, I can’t help but notice, already have voting rights – but for migrants. Everyone had an example of the transformative impact it would have in various elections, if migrants were granted the vote. The Munich mayorals were just around the corner, there was something afoot in Barcelona … I wasn’t really listening because, yet again, I’d disappeared down the rabbit hole of our own referendum. What would have happened if the three 3 million EU migrants living in the UK had been able to vote in 2016? We wouldn’t be in this mess. What would happen to immigration policy – indeed, the very language around migration – if immigrants were recast as people whose votes you wanted? It might be humane. What would have happened in the 2019 general election if the long-term UK residents whose lives were about to be upended by some blowhard promising to “get Brexit done” had had a say in the matter? He wouldn’t now be prime minister. But these sad counterfactuals weren’t really the point. It’s just morals, innit? There isn’t really a defensible civic agenda in which some people’s voices are, in perpetuity, more important than others’. Feminism was mobilised in the crucible of this understanding; if your destination is equality and justice, your route is democracy, as much of it as you can lay your hands on. You’ll notice something counterintuitive about the plan, I’m sure. The idea wasn’t “votes for migrant women” but “votes for all migrants”.

3/8/2022,"One squally day or stormy night about 1,700 years ago, a boat carrying hundreds of amphorae of wine, olives, oil and garum – the fermented fish sauce that so delighted the ancient palate – came to grief during a stopover in Mallorca. The merchant vessel, probably at anchor in the Bay of Palma while en route from south-west Spain to Italy, was quickly swallowed by the waves and buried in the sands of the shallow seabed. Until last month, its miraculously preserved treasures had lain untouched, despite sitting just 2 metres beneath the bellies of the countless tourists who swim off one of the busiest beaches in the Balearics. Now, however, the boat – known as the Ses Fontanelles wreck – is giving up its archaeological, historical and gastronomic secrets. A recovery operation overseen by the island’s governing body, the Consell de Mallorca, and involving experts from three Spanish universities in the Balearics, Barcelona and Cádiz, has retrieved about 300 amphorae as well as other objects that offer priceless insights into the Mediterranean of the fourth century AD and the crew’s daily lives. In addition to the clay jars – which still bear their painted inscriptions or tituli picti – archaeologists have found a leather shoe, a rope shoe, a cooking pot, an oil lamp and only the fourth Roman carpenter’s drill recovered from the region. The boat, which is 12 metres long and between 5 and 6 metres wide, emerged three years ago after a summer storm churned up the waters of the bay. Its appearance confirmed anecdotal reports from divers dating back to the 1950s, and prompted the Consell de Mallorca to take action. After running an emergency intervention, the consell put together a team of archaeologists and marine experts to undertake the three-year Arqueomallornauta project. “The aim is to preserve everything there and all the information it contains, and that couldn’t be done in a single emergency intervention,” says Jaume Cardell, the consell’s head of archaeology. “That’s where the project Arqueomallornauta comes in: it’s about recovering and preserving both the wreck and its historical cargo. This isn’t just about Mallorca; in the whole western Mediterranean, there are very few wrecks with such a singular cargo.” Although the team is now looking at how best to recover the hull of the wreck, which lies just 50 metres off the beach, those who brought up the cargo in an operation that ran from November 2021 to mid-February are still a little breathless over what they have found. None of the team had expected the sands of the bay to have done such a spectacular job of sealing the wreck off from oxygen and preserving its organic materials. “Things have been so perfectly preserved that we have found bits of textile, a leather shoe and an espadrille,” says Dr Miguel Ángel Cau, an archaeologist at the University of Barcelona. “The most surprising thing about the boat is just how well preserved it is – even the wood of the hull … It’s wood that you can knock – like it’s from yesterday.” The team, who established that the boat set sail from Spain’s Cartagena region by analysing the minerals in the amphorae’s clay, say it is hard to overstate the significance of the find. “It’s important in terms of naval architecture because there are very few ancient boats that are as well preserved as this one,” says Dr Darío Bernal-Casasola, an archaeologist at the University of Cádiz. “There are no complete Roman boats in Spain.” What’s more, he adds, the amphorae represent an improbable subaquatic archaeological hat-trick: “It’s incredibly difficult – almost impossible – to find whole amphorae that bear inscriptions, and also still have the remains of their contents. The state of conservation here is just amazing. And you have got all this in just 2 metres of water where millions of people have swum.” For Enrique García Riaza, a historian at the University of the Balearic Islands, the wreck highlights the commercial and strategic importance of the Balearic archipelago during the Roman empire. “The islands weren’t cut off – on the contrary, they were a fundamental staging post on routes from the Iberian peninsula and the Italic peninsula,” he says. “In Roman times, the cities of the Balearic archipelago had political elites who were also very well connected to the main Roman cities of the Mediterranean coast, such as Cartagena and Tarragona.” The team has found no trace of the boat’s crew apart from their belongings, suggesting perhaps they made it to the shore or were swept away from the wreck by the waves. What they left behind, however, is intriguing. Cau points to the oil lamp, which bears an obviously pagan symbol of the moon goddess Diana, and to the Christian signs that appear on the seals of some of the amphorae. “The crew were probably pagan, but some of the merchandise they were carrying has Christian symbols,” he says. “You have to be careful about how you interpret that – that cargo could have been from an ecclesiastical authority – but you have that coexistence between the pagan and the Christian. “That may tell us a bit about the daily lives for the crew. They might have said, ‘Look, I’m a sailor and I believe what I believe, but if you want me to carry a Christian cargo, I’m OK with that if the money’s good.’” With the recovery phase complete and the cataloguing under way, thoughts are now turning to putting the entire find on show. “The idea is to recover the hull, and we are in touch with both national and international experts to make sure it’s properly recovered,” says Cardell. “The boat needs to be exhibited and people need to see it. At the end of the day, we do archaeology for everyone and not just for the scientists.” A few weeks after the wreck’s cargo was touched by human hands for the first time in almost two millennia, the archaeologists remain buoyant. “This is one of those finds when you are just laughing all the time because you can’t believe it,” says Cau. “This is the sort of thing that happens to you once in an academic lifetime. We will never find anything like this again and that’s what makes it so special.”",News/Science,"Roman boat that sank in Mediterranean 1,700 years ago gives up its treasures",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/08/roman-boat-that-sank-in-mediterranean-1700-years-ago-gives-up-its-treasures

3/8/2022,"Where do women in the UK find themselves on International Women’s Day in 2022? In truth: more fearful about their safety, more anxious about their economic futures and wondering if the monumental gains made in gender equality over the last decades are at risk. But they are also louder and more determined than ever. It is impossible to reflect on the last 12 months without focusing on the seismic revolution of understanding of male violence against women and girls (VAWG). Research from Rosa, a grant-making charity for frontline women’s organisations, reveals that 89% of the 320 organisations they surveyed think public understanding of the problem has transformed since the murder of Sarah Everard one year ago. The past year has also seen a rupturing of the trust between women and the state agencies that pledge to protect them. At a vigil to honour Everard in Clapham Common, which police had tried and failed to prevent by threatening to heavily fine organisers, women who had come to mourn were instead forcibly removed. What trust was left took a further blow with the prosecution of two officers who shared pictures of the murdered sisters Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman, the exposure of vile sexist and racist Whatapp messages shared between officers based at London’s Charing Cross police station, and ongoing reports of officers accused of domestic abuse going unpunished, or worse uninvestigated. Speaking to the Guardian on Monday, the new national police lead on VAWG, Maggie Blyth, promised change – a prioritisation of crimes against women and a crackdown on men within the ranks of the police who abuse their power. There is a moment of opportunity, she insisted, and it is too important to waste. There is hope. At the grassroots level, councils like Greenwich, where Sabina Nessa was murdered, are helping fund plays about sexism and toxic masculinity, local youth rugby clubs are asking how they can help prevent violence against women, an outpouring of grief after the murder of Everard raised more than half a million pounds that will be distributed to small charities working at the vanguard of tackling misogyny and male violence. On the national stage, the UK government and the mayors of London and Manchester have launched a communications campaign focusing on stopping perpetrators of sexual harassment and violence. The government, the National Police Chiefs’ Council and the College of Policing have agreed to implement all the recommendations made by a damning inspection by the policing watchdog, leading to Blyth’s appointment and the upgrading of VAWG to the same strategic footing as terrorism. The challenge now will be keeping the issue in the spotlight as the horror at what happened to Everard – exposed in the trial of her killer Wayne Couzens – moves further into the past. More than a 125 women have died since International Women’s Day last year, according to the Femicide Census, which notes that a woman is killed by a man every three days. The work of ending men’s violence towards women and girls will be arduous and painstaking. It is – as many who have worked in the sector for decades can attest – the work of a lifetime. But, for now at least, the wail of anger and anguish that crescendoed after the murder of Everard continues to echo through society. Women have found their voice, and they are determined to be heard.",News/World news,Women still fear for their safety but are louder and more determined than ever,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/women-still-fear-for-their-safety-but-are-louder-and-more-determined-than-ever
3/8/2022,"Sergey Korenev was running out of time. He watched his daughter Anna, 11, practice skateboarding in a park on a rainy Thursday night outside Portland, Oregon. His midnight flight will board in a few hours that will begin a long journey to the war in Ukraine. Sergey still has to pack, but he doesn’t hurry her. Sergey, 44, has been bringing Anna here to the park for a month and each time she gets better. He watched her roll down a small hill towards him. “Come on, come on, come on …” Sergey said in Russian, smiling at the progress she’s making. Sergey’s eldest daughter Maria, 17, was standing next to him with her hoodie pulled up. She doesn’t look at her phone, even when Anna walks back up the hill and it turn quiet between her and her father. Sergey’s mother is alone in her home outside Kyiv, hiding from shelling. Sergey wants to go home to rescue her, take her to Poland and then stay and fight. Since the start of the Russian build up Sergey has been fixated on news, worried. On the night of the invasion Valentina Korenev, his ex-wife, texted him. He had already made his decision: he was going back to Ukraine. “I’ve been monitoring the situation since last fall, like everybody,” Sergey said through a translator, his brother Alex Korenev. “But when it became a total invasion, I felt like I needed to do something. I could not watch it from afar.” Sergey is one of about 66,000 Ukrainians returning home to help fight the Russian invasion following President Volodymyr’s Zelenskiy’s call for s Ukrainians abroad return to the homeland to fight the Russias. Korenev, whose family is Jewish, is one Ukrainian in the US answering the call. Later that Thursday night in his apartment in Vancouver, Washington, Sergey laid his gear on a sofa. Laptop, headphones, gloves, new boots he still has to break in, a bag of insulin for his type 2 diabetes. He’s trying to get familiar with where all the pockets are in his new military-style backpack. He doesn’t carry much, but he takes care of what he does have. His Ukrainian passport isn’t bent or worn. Only the stamps inside it give away how much it’s seen. He folds a scarf of Dynamo Kyiv soccer club into his bag. He opens a pouch with keys to his mothers home in Kyiv, checking to see if they are still there. He zips up the pouch and places it in his bag. “A lot of my friends are volunteers, in the territorial defense force. I can help them, because I know them, I told them I can bring what you need when you need it. So I’ve gotten a list of supplies of what they need,” he said. Sergey sticks a small Ukrainian flag on the outside of the backpack. On a shelf obscured by a small television is a framed award, that he’s not packing, from the Ukrainian special forces recognizing him for his work with veterans. “He is a huge patriot of Ukraine,” said his brother Alex, who has lived in Vancouver, Washington, for 11 years. “He’s going there because he feels that he’s country is under assault and wants to help his brothers in arms.” Alex said his brother felt the need to help in some way after he saw his friends killed in the Maiden revolution in 2013. When fighting broke out in the eastern region of Donetsk in 2014, Sergey and Valentina, an interior designer, started a foundation to help those fighting. They lobbied companies to donate construction materials that they could use to fix apartments. If a father or a son was killed in action, leaving behind a family with a roof to replace and plumbing to fix, they would do it for free. If a veteran returned from the war without meaning and purpose, with just a hammer or a paint brush, Sergey and Valentina would find them one. They even helped the nascent Ukrainian military, as at the time a special forces unit was relocated to a barracks with bare walls. “They made it livable with windows, doors, put floor in, paint it, and put some chairs and furniture,” said Alex. But, by immigrating to the US, he and Valentina had been trying to give their daughters a shot at a better life, at more opportunity. “They wanted to try a better life, they have two young daughters and they thought it’s gonna be good for them to grow here and get good education,” said Alex. “They just won the lottery green card, if you win the lottery you use it.” Sergey has been embracing life in America’s Pacific north-west. “He’s been exploring the craft beer landscape, he’s been buying every time something new, a couple of cans and making photos and archiving it all,” said Alex. Sergey speaks Russian at home and is still learning English. He’s taken gig economy jobs that let him work while still learning the language, driving for Uber and Doordash. “Since he’s been doing DoorDash he’s been exposed to a lot of different cuisine. For example, he’s been taking Mediterranean stuff home, Chick-fil-A and a lot of pizza,” Alex said. Korenev is leaving home tonight on a mission with three objectives. First he’s taking $9,000 in donations from Ukrainian community in Oregon. He’s flying to New York on to pick up some more donations from friends in the Ukrainian community there. Then he’s flying to Warsaw, Poland, to cross the border over land. His second objective is to get to Kyiv as fast as possible to find his mother and get her to safety. He hopes to get her out of the country. His final objective is to help win a war. “I’m going there to help my friends, they are my brothers in arms,” Sergey said. One of his final acts with his family was to drop off his Mercedes SUV at his ex-wife’s home and to say goodbye. Valentina had a gift waiting for him: a new pair of boots. He was surprised. He tried them on and then went to his bag and gave Maria the receipt for his other pair, with instructions to return them and keep the money. His ex-wife is scared for him but supports his decision. “I think it’s the right thing to do,” Valentina said. “I and our children are very worried, of course, but Ii agreed to help in any way I can. If I need to come, I will come to Ukraine. But for now, I can do more good from here.” Near midnight, at Portland international airport, Sergey walks with his daughters and brother towards security. He takes out the dollars in his wallet and hands them to Anna to keep. He sets his bag down and picks Anna up, holding her in the air. A couple try to get past Sergey’s group and stop. One of them points to the Ukrainian flag sticking out of his bag, aware of what’s happening, and they both back away for a moment to watch Sergey say goodbye to his family. Maria holds her younger sister, after their father has left, letting her cry in her arms. When asked about how she feels about her dad leaving to join the war effort, Maria has a simple answer: “Scared? No, I’m proud.”",News/US news,‘I can help them’: one man’s journey from Portland to Ukraine’s frontlines,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/08/portland-to-ukraine-frontlines-russia-invasion
3/8/2022,"Last summer, Katelyn Samples posted a picture of her youngest son, Locklan Samples, to Instagram. Then a stranger sent her a message. It asked if her then 10-month-old son had been diagnosed with uncombable hair syndrome. The 33-year-old mother from Roswell, Georgia, was worried. “At first, you see ‘syndrome’ and you’re like, ‘Oh my gosh,’ like, is something wrong with my baby? Is he in pain or something?” she told ABC’s Good Morning America. Samples began searching on Google and called her paediatrician. The doctor told her they had never heard of the syndrome, but referred her to a paediatric dermatologist at Emory Healthcare, in Atlanta. There, Locklan was diagnosed with uncombable hair syndrome, or UHS. A rare genetic disorder of the hair shaft, UHS is characterised by disorderly silvery-blond or straw-colored hair. The hair, which stands out from the scalp, cannot be combed flat. The syndrome commonly shows up in children between three and 12. “When you look under the microscope, you can see that instead of having hairs that are cylinder shape … the shaft of the hair is actually more in a triangular shape,” Dr Carol Cheng, a paediatric dermatologist at UCLA Health, told ABC. “Within the triangle, there [are] these little grooves that go up and down the long axis of the hair shaft, so that’s why it makes it really uncombable.” Scientists know of only about 100 cases and according to the National Institutes of Health there is currently no definitive treatment. However, the condition typically improves or resolves itself once puberty begins. Samples said her son’s hair has a “crimp” in it, adding: “It can get matted easily. It is very fragile … It can get tangled and I do have to be careful. That would be an example of a time I actually would wash it because I very rarely wash his hair. Just doesn’t need to be. It doesn’t really get greasy.” In her initial research, Samples noticed that information was scarce. However, she soon found a Facebook group created solely for those with experience of UHS. The group exchanges information on hairstyles, products and care. “That has been extremely helpful … it’s been comforting,” Samples told the Washington Post. The only possible symptom Locklan has been experiencing is “extremely sensitive skin”, Samples said, adding that other parents in the Facebook group noticed this in their kids. Sometimes, she said, children with UHS can overheat. After Locklan’s diagnosis, Samples followed her husband’s advice and launched @uncombable_locks, an Instagram account featuring pictures of Locklan and his hair. Seven months later, users have thrown their support behind Locklan. One wrote: “I love him so much!!! I would love to see all the other kids in a pic together that have UHS.” Another user wrote: “Loving his fuzz top and mullet in the back. Shall we just say he’s rocker chic?” Samples describes the attention as “filled with joy and extremely kind”. People sometimes ask to take pictures with Locklan, she said, adding that she does not mind “as long as the baby is happy and vibing with it”.",News/US news,US boy with uncombable hair syndrome becomes Instagram hit,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/08/uncombable-hair-syndrom-instagram-locklan-samples
3/8/2022,"For many women and girls, the ability to buy a sports bra is taken for granted. The very concept of feeling discomfort while exercising is alien to a lot of us, who have the money needed to buy one and time to have it correctly fitted. In the age of active wear, some even have a few. But for many other young women, a sports bra is a luxury they cannot afford on top of basic living expenses. The result is often that they simply do not play sport. In 2018, New Yorker Sarah Dwyer-Shick sought to change this, starting The Sports Bra Project to facilitate the donation of new sports bras from companies and individuals to give to those facing barriers to participation which can, on the surface, be remedied. The American project has so far channelled more than 7,000 donated bras to 55 organisations across 26 countries. Now it is coming to Australia, after Women Sport Australia on Tuesday announced it has partnered with The Sports Bra Project to source local bras it can provide to local communities, particularly remote Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory and also those affected by the floods in Queensland and New South Wales. “A sports bra is obviously a piece of equipment that is unique to girls and women, and if you don’t have the right support there you’re not going to want to play sport,” said Women Sport Australia president Gen Dohrmann, who is also chief executive of Table Tennis Victoria and a dance teacher. “I work in different sports in Melbourne and everyone has access to sports bras, but I think there’s definitely lots of remote communities around Australia where that definitely wouldn’t be the case. “It’s targeting those women and girls who aren’t already playing sport because they have to spend their pay cheque on food and shelter and bills. “To be able to bring some of this initiative where people are donating new sports bras to be able to get out to remote Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory and potentially at the moment those affected by floods. That’s where we’ll be concentrating our efforts.” The process operates via the website, where individuals and companies can donate independently or as part of an organised drive, and where individuals, communities and sporting clubs can register to become a recipient. Dohrmann said Women Sport Australia then conduct due diligence to ensure resources are distributed where they are most needed. The initiative has already been tested at local fundraisers and talks are under way with bra manufacturers, including Under Armour, who may donate some of its unused stock to the cause. Another is Brava Lingerie which specialises in plus-sized busts ranging from D to K cup sizes. “We want to make sure we’re not just getting 10B bras donated,” Dohrmann said. “We ask people to donate the size of bra that you wear so we get a real range of sizes.” The project is also set to receive some of the bras produced for the Australian athletes who competed at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Among the supporters is Australian Paralympic gold medallist, Madison de Rozario. “The Sports Bra Project is such a practical way to give support to women and girls who want to participate in sport but can’t always get access to the right gear,” she said. “We know that physical activity plays a significant role in improving health, building stronger communities and giving people a purpose.” Inspiration for the original Sports Bra Project began in Africa, where Dwyer-Shick, a long-time football coach with expertise in youth development and increasing access to sports for girls and women, gifted sports bras to young players in rural Namibia. She discovered that many members of the Namibian National Women’s football team had never owned this basic piece of equipment, and that the problem was not requested to this one country. Dohrmann said sport should not be considered a luxury for any young woman. “We just want to make sure if they can feel more confident in getting out for a run or going down to the local playground and doing some exercises or the local basketball court,” she said. “If they actually have a sports bra that’s going to open up a door for them.”",Sport/Sport,Not a luxury: campaign launched to provide sports bras and remove participation barriers,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/08/not-a-luxury-campaign-launched-to-provide-sports-bras-and-remove-participation-barriers
3/8/2022,"Sri Lanka is in mourning after the death of the country’s most sacred elephant, who is to be given a state funeral and his remains to be preserved and stuffed “for future generations” on orders of the president. Nadungamuwa Vijaya Raja, popularly known as Raja, was considered to be the largest tamed elephant in Asia and as a young calf he had been among those “chosen” as the elite elephants who carried sacred Buddhist relics during an annual parade in Sri Lanka. After news of his death aged 68, hundreds of mourners travelled to see his body at his residence on the outskirts of Colombo, which was covered in a white shroud and adorned with flowers. Born in the Indian city of Mysore in 1953, according to folklore, Raja was one of two elephant calves gifted by the king of Mysore to a Sri Lankan physician monk to thank him for curing one of king’s relatives of an illness. For over a decade, Raja’s sacred role had been to carry the casket containing the holy tooth relic of lord Buddha during the annual procession of Esala, an important religious pageant for the country’s Buddhist majority which takes place in July during the full moon in the city of Kandy. According to tradition, only certain elephants with very specific physical traits can be selected for this holy role. They have to be have a flat back, specially curved tusks and when they stand all seven points of the elephant– their four legs, trunk, penis and tail – must all touch the ground. Raja was considered so important that when he travelled he had his own security detail, and a military unit was deployed when he made his annual 90km walk from his residence to the city of Kandy, where the Temple of the Sacred Tooth relic is located and the religious procession takes place. President Gotabaya Rajapksa declared Raja to be a “national treasure” and said that after the Buddhist last rites had been performed on the elephant, his cadaver would be handed over to taxidermists who would stuff it for posterity. He will be given full state honours for his funeral. He would not be the first sacred elephant to be given such treatment in death. His predecessor, also known as Raja, was also stuffed and preserved after he died aged 75 and now sits within his own museum in the Temple of the Sacred Tooth relic in Sri Lanka.",News/World news,Sri Lanka to hold state funeral for beloved sacred elephant Raja,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/sri-lanka-to-hold-state-funeral-for-beloved-sacred-elephant-raja
3/8/2022,"Hello, it is Tuesday morning and time for the briefing with me, Warren Murray. Millions of people are on the move across Ukraine in Europe’s biggest refugee crisis since the second world war. And it is only just beginning, writes Luke Harding from alongside a vast caravan of vehicles waiting to get into Poland, where a million have already arrived. “Putin’s soldiers are killing civilians and shelling cities. They destroy everything. Look at Mariupol,” says Lena, travelling in a three-car family convoy. “We heard the explosions. Seven of them. It was terrible,” she said. The number of Ukrainian refugees granted visas to come to the UK under the new family scheme has risen from about 50 to 300, the government has announced, leading Labour to criticise the “shockingly low” figure. On the battlefront inside Ukraine it is being reported that a senior Russian officer, Maj Gen Vitaly Gerasimov, chief of staff of the 41st army, has been killed outside Kharkiv, along with other senior officers, in a significant blow to Russian morale. Ukrainian military intelligence released what it said was a conversation between two Russian FSB officers discussing Gerasimov’s death. The investigative agency Bellingcat said the call was intercepted partly because the Russians’ secure communications had failed, forcing them to use normal mobile phones. Overnight, Moscow has stoked fears of an energy war by threatening to close Nord Stream 1, the major gas pipeline to Germany, after the US pushed its European allies to consider banning Russian oil imports. On Russian state TV, deputy PM Alexander Novak said that since Germany had halted certification of the new Nord Stream 2 joint venture, “we have every right to take a matching decision and impose an embargo on gas pumping through the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline”. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has meanwhile made an impassioned address vowing to stay in Ukraine until the war is won. Zelenskiy is due to speak to British MPs by video link today. His government rejected an offer from Moscow to create “humanitarian corridors” for civilians after it emerged that most of the supposedly safe routes led directly to Russia or Belarus. Coverage of Vladimir Putin’s catastrophic war on Ukraine continues at our live blog. ‘Halt this tax rise’ – Labour will today spring a snap vote on cancelling the increase in national insurance contributions (NICs), warning it will cost the average private sector worker £410 a year. It comes after the Office for Budget Responsibility found that in addition to the NICs rise directly levied on employees, 80% of the equivalent increase in employers’ contributions would be “passed through to workers via lower nominal wages”. There is also growing unease among Tories amid the cost of living crisis: Jacob Rees-Mogg is one of the Conservatives who have called for the rise to be delayed. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said: “The Conservatives are trapping us in a high-tax, low-growth cycle. They must get behind Labour’s motion tomorrow and halt this tax rise before it’s too late.” ‘Economic warfare bill’ – Oligarchs or kleptocrats who try to sell off property in order to avoid it being listed in a new public register may be forced to declare their details upon sale, after ministers promised to toughen up the economic crime bill which was rushed through the Commons on Monday in response to Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. It targets criminals and those – such as Russian oligarchs – who might be seeking to shelter illicitly acquired money, particularly through property purchases. The former cabinet minister David Davis said it was not a “perfectly crafted bill” and was initially designed for a different purpose but had become an “economic warfare bill – a war that liberal democracies cannot afford to lose”. Female artists show their faces – The National Portrait Gallery has acquired five self-portraits by female artists as part of a three-year project to enhance its representation of women. The gallery, which is closed for refurbishment, said the works highlighted stories of women who have helped shape British culture. They include the first painted self-portrait by a black female artist in the gallery’s collection. Everlyn Nicodemus’s Självporträtt, Åkersberga layers multiple faces in recognition of her roles as artist, writer, mother and wife. Rose Finn-Kelcey’s self-portrait, Preparatory Study for “Divided Self”, shows two images of herself engaging in conversation while sitting on a bench at Speaker’s Corner in London’s Hyde Park. Also represented are Chila Kumari Burman, Celia Paul and Susan Hillier. The acquisitions are part of a three-year project in partnership with the Chanel Culture Fund. Call for radical police overhaul – Police officers would need to hold and renew a “licence to practice” every five years and be subject to strict conditions under proposals to boost confidence in policing. An independent review chaired by Sir Michael Barber and carried out by the Police Foundation thinktank contains 56 recommendations for radical reform. There should also be national targets to improve the diversity of the police workforce, Barber says, along with the merger of back-office functions across the 43 forces of England and Wales, which Barber argues would save hundreds of millions of pounds. Police chiefs said the report was “thorough and thought-provoking”. ‘Misguided quixotism’ – Libby Purves, the former Radio 4 presenter, has criticised the BBC for editing out racially insensitive and politically incorrect jokes from archived shows like Dad’s Army, Steptoe and Son and I’m Sorry, I’ll Read That Again. Purves said in Radio Times that she had “joined the outcry” at the editing, and that while she was sure it was well intentioned there was “no obvious end to such misguided quixotism”. “Why would a world that anxiously preserves the jejune wall-scrawls of Banksy be so cavalier with its grandparents’ record? It can’t affect us now. It’s actually refreshing to be made to cringe: it shows how far we have come.” Purves has previously railed against wokeism, often called “cancel culture”, one of the many fronts to the so-called culture wars. A million and a half people have been forced to escape their homes in Ukraine. Annie Kelly and Lorenzo Tondo explain what this growing refugee crisis looks like.

Nonetheless, here is how the UK welcomed Putin’s man in Ukraine. Frank Lampard blamed individual errors rather than tactical disarray or poor attitude for Everton’s 5-0 thrashing by Tottenham after another miserable away performance from a side that last celebrated a league victory outside Goodison Park in August. Joe Root has admitted his England team have a point to prove in the Caribbean and reiterated his own belief at being the right man to lead in a Test series that could decide his fate as captain. Eddie Jones has billed Ireland as favourites for Saturday’s Six Nations showdown at Twickenham, pointing to how they are the most “cohesive” team in the world and highlighting how England’s player release agreement differs from their rivals. Nottingham Forest will host Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-finals after a 2-1 victory over Huddersfield with Sam Surridge and Ryan Yates completing their comeback win. Shane Warne achieved greatness, writes Jonathan Liew, but never pretended to be perfect, and perhaps we all loved him a little bit more because of that. And three Guardian writers have won British Sports Journalism Awards at Monday’s ceremony. Shares have fallen in Asia-Pacific trading after Wall Street logged its biggest drop in more than a year with markets jolted by another surge in oil prices. Benchmarks declined in Tokyo, Sydney, Hong Kong, Seoul and Shanghai following a 3% tumble for the S&P 500. The FTSE is showing a drop of 100 points, according to futures trading ahead of the open, while the pound is worth $1.312 and €1.207 at time of writing. “Kyiv rejects Putin offer to let people flee into Russia” – the Guardian’s front-page lead today. Also on page one: “Cultural ties fray as fear and outrage grip Odesa” – Shaun Walker writes from the city: “Nobody can quite believe that Vladimir Putin would launch an assault on a place bound to Russia by family, literary and cultural ties, a place of almost mythical resonance for many Russians.” “Pull your finger out” – the Metro amplifies calls by the ex-head of the army, Lord Dannatt, to speed up help for Ukrainian refugees (he actually said “extract the digit”, as the body copy reports). The i puts it in less colourful terms: “UK urged to help refugees”. “Shredded faces chart Putin’s strategy better than any map” – the Times’ splash is accompanied by a photograph of Yelena, 55, one of those maimed in Russian attacks on Kharkiv. “Please help us” – the Mirror features two little boys waiting in Calais for the UK to let them in. Its splash is “McShame”, about “burger giants and others” from the west still trading in Russia. The Telegraph has “Putin sets out his key demands to halt invasion” – they include Ukraine giving up Crimea and two separatist states, and changing its constitution to rule out EU or Nato membership. “Let it go!” – what the Sun is saying to Putin as it tells the story of a brave little Frozen fan sheltering in a Kyiv bunker. “New dash for gas to break Putin’s grip” – the Mail has the PM’s pledge to suck more out of the North Sea. The Financial Times says “Markets rattled by push for Russian crude ban as refugee crisis mounts”. The Guardian Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.
