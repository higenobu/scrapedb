5/4/2022,"A recent social media post from Olympic skier Eileen Gu in which she says goodbye to China after months of making it her home for the Beijing Winter Games has drawn both plaudits and criticism.

Gu, who won two gold medals and one silver medal while representing China this year, is making her way back to the U.S. to begin her studies at Stanford University. The star athlete deferred a year to participate in the Winter Games.

On April 27, she shared a post to Weibo saying, “Thank you China,” with emojis of the Chinese flag and a red heart, along with a series of photos from her time in the country.

The hashtag “Gu Ailing posts on Weibo to thank China,"" referring to Gu by her localized name, quickly became a top trending subject on the platform, CNN reported. Within two days, it garnered over 290 million views.

While many of her fans reciprocated the love, some social media users weren’t as impressed by the way she worded her thanks, accusing her of acting ""like a foreigner."" They argued that her post seemed to be her distancing herself from China, as she failed to refer to it in the same way other athletes have in the past, using the words “motherland” or “my country.”

""Ultimately she thinks of herself as an American. She only joined China temporarily,"" a top comment reportedly said.

Weibo has since limited search results for the hashtag to mostly positive comments from official accounts.

Gu, who was born and raised in the U.S., was praised in China for her choice to represent the country her mother is from. Though in doing so, Gu was also criticized by Americans for being “opportunistic,” amid strained U.S.-China relations.

Gu previously faced criticism during the Olympics after advocating for the use of VPNs to bypass the country’s social media restrictions.

5/4/2022,"Naomi Judd's cause of death has come to light. The Grammy-winning country star, known for her work as one half of the mother-daughter duo the Judds, died by suicide Saturday at 76, after struggling with mental illness for much of her life, according to PEOPLE. Multiple sources reportedly confirmed the news. A representative for Judd told EW on Tuesday that he could not confirm the cause of death and added, ""There is an ongoing investigation by law enforcement and the coroner's office, and any further information will be released by the proper authorities."" Judd's daughters Ashley and Wynonna announced her death over the weekend in a statement to the Associated Press. ""Today we sisters experienced a tragedy. We lost our beautiful mother to the disease of mental illness,"" they said. ""We are shattered. We are navigating profound grief and know that as we loved her, she was loved by her public. We are in unknown territory."" Nathan Congleton/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty Images Naomi Judd An outspoken advocate for mental health, Naomi Judd opened up about her struggles with suicidal depression in her 2016 book River of Time: My Descent into Depression and How I Emerged With Hope. She also wrote an open letter about suicide for Mental Health Awareness Week in 2018. ""To understand this issue better, we have to bring the study of suicide into mainstream neuroscience and treat the condition like every other brain disorder,"" she wrote. ""People who commit suicide are experiencing problems with mood, impulse control and aggression, all of which involve discrete circuits in the brain that regulate these aspects of human experience, but we still don't understand how these circuits go haywire in the brains of suicide victims."" Naomi and her daughter Wynonna recently reunited on stage at the CMT Music Awards, in what was their first TV performance in 20 years. They were also set to perform on a 10-date, nearly sold-out arena tour, The Final Tour, which was scheduled to begin in September. The Judds, who scored 14 No. 1 hits on the country music charts between 1983 and 1991, were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame on Sunday, and Wynonna and Ashley gave tearful speeches at the ceremony. ""I'm going to make this fast because my heart's broken, and I feel so blessed,"" Wynonna said. ""It's a very strange dynamic to be this broken and this blessed."" This article has been updated with a statement from Judd's representative.
