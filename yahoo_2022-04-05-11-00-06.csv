4/5/2022,"White House press secretary Jen Psaki slapped down Fox News reporter Peter Doocy — again — on Monday when she asked if he could name any sex education program in a Florida kindergarten that would justify the state’s new “Don’t Say Gay” law. Doocy had pressed Psaki on the Biden administration’s opposition to the highly controversial law, which bans discussion of gender identification and sexual orientation in classrooms from kindergarten through third grade. In a peculiar question, Doocy asked, “Does the White House support that kind of classroom instruction before kindergarten?” Psaki shot back: “Do you have examples of schools in Florida that are teaching kindergarteners about sex education?” “I’m just asking for the president’s opinion ...” Doocy started to respond. Psaki: “I think that’s a relevant question” because the law is nothing more than a “politically charged, harsh law that is putting parents and LGBTQ+ kids in a very difficult, heartbreaking circumstance.” She said the White House thinks the law is a reflection of “politicians in Florida propagating misinformed, hateful policies that do absolutely nothing to address the real issues.” Psaki responded that the U.S. Department of Education is weighing next steps, including possible action against the measure for violating federal civil rights law. Several LGBTQ advocacy groups and families filed a joint federal suit against the law Thursday, arguing that it is unconstitutional and has already begun to harm children and families. But the law could be far more universal than many initially imagined. The Florida law, in fact, does not mention the word “gay” in the text in a weak effort to skirt the Constitution. And since it now bans addressing gender identity and sexual orientation issues in lower grades, the law could convincingly be understood to apply to all sexual orientation and genders. A satirical letter circulating among Florida teachers suggests now referring to all students as “they” and “them” to avoid risky “gendered pronouns” like “he” and “she.” Also “Mr.” and “Mrs.” would have to be eliminated for teachers, according to the letter. Twitter wags responding to the letter also raised other issues: Will the words “boys” and “girls” have to be eliminated from school bathrooms? What happens to “female” and “male” sports teams? “If “Heather Has Two Mommies” can’t be read in the classroom, then books like “Fun With Dick and Jane” (and their presumably heterosexual parents) should also be banned, noted critics.

4/5/2022,"A Ukrainian drone unit used quad bikes and night cover to ambush Russian forces, The Guardian reported. Aerorozvidka was first set up by tech-savvy, university-educated Ukrainians. The elite unit, which flies up to 300 missions a day, is crucial to the Ukrainian campaign. Night ambushes carried out by a team of Ukrainian special forces and drone operators on quad bikes have helped turn the tide of the Russian invasion, The Guardian reported. Aerorozvidka is a specialist air-reconnaissance unit within the Ukrainian army, which has claimed to have destroyed dozens of Russian ""priority targets,"" including tanks and command trucks. The unit's commander, Lt Col Yaroslav Honchar, told The Guardian about an ambush near the Ukrainian town of Ivankiv, which helped stop a 40-mile mechanized Russian column heading to attack the capital Kyiv. Equipped with night-vision goggles, sniper rifles, and remotely detonated mines and drones, the team of about 30 Ukrainian soldiers approached Russian forces by riding on quad bikes through forests under cover of night. Some of the drones used by the unit were equipped with thermal imaging cameras, and others were capable of dropping small 1.5kg bombs. ""This one little unit in the night destroyed two or three vehicles at the head of this convoy, and after that, it was stuck. They stayed there two more nights and [destroyed] many vehicles,"" Honchar told The Guardian. After the attack, Russian forces re-strategized by breaking the column into smaller units to try and continue towards the capital. However, the same team mounted an attack on the Russians' supply depot, which stopped them from being able to advance, Honchar told The Guardian. ""It all happened because of the work of 30 people,"" Honchar told the paper. Aerorozvidka was formed in 2014 by a group of young university-educated Ukrainians and IT specialists who volunteered to design their machines to help resist Russia's invasion of Crimea and the Donbas region, according to The Guardian. It was founded by investment banker Volodymyr Kochetkov-Sukach, who was killed in action fighting Russian separatists in Donbas in 2015, the paper said. The unit integrated into the Ukrainian general staff following the success of its operations in Crimea. Now, the elite unit, which flies up to 300 missions a day, according to The Times of London, has played a key role in bolstering Ukrainian resistance against Russia. Along with the attack on the Russian convoy, Aerorozvidka claims to have helped defeat a Russian attack on Hostomel airport near Kyiv, The Guardian said. Despite the unit's apparent success, it relies upon crowdfunding and donations to get hold of much-needed components such as advanced modems and thermal imaging cameras. These US and Canada-made parts are subject to export controls that prohibit them from being sent to Ukraine, The Guardian reported. In recent weeks, supporters from around Europe have been donating drone parts and other equipment, such as 3D printers, to help build and repair devices damaged by Russian small-arms fire, per The Times. Aerorozvidka partly operates using Elon Musk's Starlink satellite system, activated in Ukraine days after Russia invaded.

4/5/2022,"Rising NASCAR star Hailie Deegan didn't participate in last week's Freedom 500 at Bradenton's (Florida) DeSoto Speedway, and now we know why. Deegan, a full-time NASCAR Truck Series driver and one of the few female drivers in the sport, posted a video to her YouTube account late Monday saying that she skipped the race in fear for her life. Deegan, who titled the video, ""Our Lives Are Being Threatened,"" said she ultimately chose to miss the race because she saw a post from a fan who lives near her race shop that threatened to kill her boyfriend, Chase Cabre. ""His official words were, not that he's going to kill Chase, but that he's going to come ... and be the last thing Chase ever sees,"" Deegan says in the 15-minute video. Deegan starts the video by explaining she missed the event because of a personal matter between her and Cabre.

""It kind of scared me a little bit, because I'd dealt with stalker situations before,"" said Deegan. ""I went home that day, looked up the guy's name on the note, and figured out that he was getting catfished by a fake Hailie Deegan account."" Catfishing, put simply, is a deceptive activity where a person creates a fictional persona or fake identity of a person on a social networking service. ""They say anything they have to to get money out of that person,"" Deegan continues in the video. Deegan later said that the fake account went on to accuse Cabre of holding her ""hostage,"" beating her and physically abusing her. ""None of that is true,"" Deegan says in the video. ""But it makes them feel a lot of anger toward Chase. Then this guy gets wrapped up in this whole deal believing Chase beats me."" Cabre, who appears in the video alongside Deegan, goes on to say that he then saw another threatening social media post later that night after dinner. Following that admission, the YouTube video then plays a 30-second clip of a sound bite from the alleged person threatening Cabre. ""At that point, someone who lives, I wouldn't say close, but not too far away from where it would be possible,"" Cabre says. ""It makes you a little worried inside. Then, Hailie said ... let's call the cops."" According to the video, local authorities then stayed with the couple 24/7. Deegan, who said she first noticed alarming posts from the alleged person late last year, said everything they posted was ""death-related."" She screenshotted the posts — ""I know you need proof when stuff like this happens,"" she says — and the authorities stayed with the two all night. ""The messages have progressively gotten worse,"" Deegan says later in the video, adding that they've been going on for over two weeks now. ""When you get tagged in pictures of guns and knives, literally by the hour ... this guy is very persistent on social media ... maybe over 100 times a day."" Deegan, who said that the couple has reached out to the person to say the account is fake, eventually admits that she is ""done"" being scared. ""I went to the extent of messaging him, literally just trying to break down the situation,"" she says. ""Dude, you're getting catfished. This isn't me, my boyfriend does not beat me. We literally do everything together — I'm on TV all the time. I'm just explaining the whole thing, trying to break it down to him, and he seemed like he was accepting it at first."" Then, Deegan continued, the person started to have second thoughts, thinking they were ""messaging the other account."" At that point, the couple says, they contacted FBI agents, NASCAR security and filed multiple police reports. ""If you are watching this video right now ... just please stop,"" Cabre says. ""I'm not threatening, I'm doing anything ... I'm just saying, it's over. It's not real. Just leave it alone."" ""It's become a nuisance in our life, because it's put everything on a halt,"" Deegan adds. ""We don't really know what to do from here.""

4/5/2022,"Mikhail Khodorkovsky told CNN that Vladimir Putin was at war ""not with Ukraine"" but with NATO. The exiled oligarch said propagandists were preparing Russians ""for an attack on NATO countries."" Khodorkovsky said Putin would prepare to invade the Baltics if he concluded he'd won in Ukraine. The exiled Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky said in an interview with CNN on Sunday that the next step in Russian President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine might be the invasion of the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. ""We must understand that, in his head, Putin is at war not with Ukraine,"" Khodorkovsky said. ""He's at war with the United States and NATO. He said this more than once."" Khodorkovsky, a former oil tycoon, was considered the wealthiest man in Russia until 2003 when, for what he says were political reasons, Putin charged him with financial crimes and imprisoned him for nine years. Since Khodorkovsky's release in 2013, he has been an outspoken critic of the Kremlin and Putin's government. ""His propagandists have already been started to prepare Russian society for an attack on NATO countries. They're constantly talking about this,"" Khodorkovsky said. ""And this is the preparation of Russian public opinion for this."" Early last month, Khodorkovsky predicted the invasion of Ukraine would end Putin's government. In his Sunday interview with Fareed Zakaria, however, he expressed concern that Putin went ""insane"" when Ukrainians resisted the invasion and that the attacks could escalate. ""I'm absolutely convinced that, if Putin decides that he has won in Ukraine, this is not going to be the last step, the last war,"" Khodorkovsky said. ""The next steps will be the Baltic countries."" Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are all members of NATO. President Joe Biden said early after Russia invaded Ukraine that the US would ""defend every inch of NATO territory,"" and he's moved American troops into the region.

4/5/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) - Military conscripts in the Russian-backed Donbas region have been sent into front-line combat against Ukrainian troops with no training, little food and water, and inadequate weapons, six people in the separatist province told Reuters. The new accounts of untrained and ill-equipped conscripts being deployed are a fresh indication of how stretched the military resources at the Kremlin's disposal are, over a month into a war that has seen Moscow's forces hobbled by logistical problems and held up by fierce Ukrainian resistance. One of the people, a student conscripted in late February, said a fellow fighter told him to prepare to repel a close-quarter attack by Ukrainian forces in southwest Donbas but ""I don't even know how to fire an automatic weapon."" The student and his unit fired back and evaded capture, but he was injured in a later battle. He did not say when the fighting took place. While some information indicating poor conditions and morale among Donbas conscripts has emerged in social media and some local media outlets, Reuters was able to assemble one of the most comprehensive pictures to date. Besides the student draftee, Reuters spoke to three wives of conscripts who have mobile phone contact with their partners, one acquaintance of a draftee, and one source close to the pro-Russian separatist leadership who is helping to organize supplies for the Donbas armed forces. Reuters verified the identity of the student, as well as the other sources and the draftees they are associated with. The news agency was unable to confirm independently the accounts of what happened to the men once they were drafted. The six sources all asked that their full names not be published, saying that they feared reprisals for speaking to foreign media. The Donbas armed forces are fighting alongside Russian soldiers but are not part of the Russian armed forces, which have different rules about which troops they send into combat. Several Donbas draftees have been issued with a rifle called a Mosin, which was developed in the late 19th century and went out of production decades ago, according to three people who saw conscripts from the separatist region using the weapon. Images shared on social media, that Reuters has not been able to verify independently, also showed Donbas fighters with Mosin rifles. The student said he was forced to drink water from a fetid pond because of lack of supplies. Two other sources in contact with draftees also told Reuters the men had to drink untreated water. Some Donbas conscripts were given the highly dangerous mission of drawing enemy fire onto themselves so other units could identify the Ukrainian positions and bomb them, according to one of the sources and video testimony from a prisoner of war published by Ukrainian forces. Asked to comment about the treatment and low morale of the Donbass draftees, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was a question for the Donetsk People's Republic (DNR), the self-proclaimed separatist entity in Donbas. The Russian defence ministry did not respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for the DNR administration, after viewing Reuters questions, said there would be no response on Friday. She did not say when the administration would reply. Messages left with a spokesman for the separatist military went unanswered. After being pushed to the front line near the port of Mariupol — scene of the heaviest fighting in the war — a group of about 135 Donbas conscripts laid down their arms and refused to fight on, according to Veronika, the partner of a conscript, who said her husband was among them. Marina, partner of another conscript, said she had been in contact with a friend who was part of the same group. ""We're refusing (to fight),"" the friend wrote in a text message to Marina, seen by Reuters. The men were kept in a basement by military commanders as punishment, Veronika and Marina said. Commanders verbally threatened them with reprisals but subsequently allowed the group out of the basement, pulled them back from the front line and billeted them in abandoned homes, Veronika said. Neither the Kremlin nor separatist authorities answered Reuters questions about the incident. CALL-UP All sides in the Ukraine war have systems of conscription, where young men are required by law to do military service. Ukraine's government has declared a general mobilisation, meaning that conscripts and reservists have been deployed to fight. Russia says it is not deploying conscripts in Ukraine, though it has acknowledged a small number were mistakenly sent to fight. The Donetsk separatist authorities announced in late February they were drafting all fighting age men for immediate deployment. Military recruitment officers appeared at workplaces around the Donetsk region and told employees to report for duty, while police ordered people in the streets to report to their local draft office, according to a Reuters reporter who was there in late February. Anyone not complying risks prosecution. Reuters could not determine how many people have been called up, nor what proportion of Donbas forces is comprised of draftees. None of the five draftees had prior military experience or training, and four of the five were given no training before they were sent into combat, according to the injured draftee, the three wives of conscripted men, and the acquaintance. ""He never served in the army,"" said one of the partners, who gave her name as Olga and lives in the town of Makeevka. ""He doesn't even really know how to hold an automatic weapon."" Two of the wives said their partners were deployed to the front line, where they saw heavy fighting. ""I'm in the war,"" read a text message, seen by Reuters, that Marina, also from Makeevka, said came from her drafted husband. Marina said she learned from messages from her husband that his unit, fighting in the Donbas region, was ordered to draw enemy fire on to themselves. Ukrainian forces on March 12 published a video showing a prisoner of war. He said his name was Ruslan Khalilov, that he was a civil servant from Donbas and that he was sent with zero training to Mariupol where his role was to draw enemy fire to facilitate the bombing of Ukrainian targets. A person in Donbas who knows Khalilov confirmed to Reuters his identity, that he was drafted and has no military training. Reuters established that the person knows Khalilov. ""SLAUGHTERHOUSE"" The student draftee who spoke to Reuters said that a day after reporting for duty he was put in a mortar unit then sent towards the fighting. ""We were taught nothing,"" he wrote to Reuters via messenger app. ""Up to that point I had only seen mortars in movies. Obviously, I didn't know how to do anything with them."" He said that before he left, his unit had been under repeated attack by Ukrainian troops. ""There were lots of casualties,"" he wrote. ""I hate the war. I don't want it, curse it. Why are they sending me into a slaughterhouse?"" All the accounts gathered by Reuters mentioned an acute shortage of supplies. The sources described little or no safe drinking water, field rations for one man being shared among several, and units having to scavenge food. ""We drank water with dead frogs in it,"" said the student conscript. ""Supplies for the soldiers right now are a disaster,"" said the source close to the Donetsk separatist leadership, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Neither the Kremlin nor the separatist authorities replied to Reuters’ questions about supplies and equipment for the draftees from Donbas. WORLD WAR TWO RIFLE The same source said some conscripts were issued with the Mosin rifle from reserve stocks that date back to the Second World War. The student conscript said he has seen fellow fighters using the rifle: ""It's like we're fighting with World War Two muskets."" A soldier in the Russian armed forces who is fighting near Mariupol told Reuters he had seen soldiers from the Donetsk separatist military carrying Mosin rifles. A video posted on social media on Tuesday by Russian military journalist Semyon Pegov showed a man who said he was a Donbas draftee brandishing a Mosin rifle. Soon after the men were drafted in late February, many of their wives, mothers, and sisters started writing petitions to the separatist leadership, to Donbas draft offices, and to the Kremlin, describing their treatment and seeking help. ""Bring us back our men,"" said one petition addressed to Russian President Vladimir Putin, seen by Reuters. The three wives of draftees who spoke to Reuters said they received no definitive answers. On March 11, about 100 women gathered outside the separatist administration’s offices in Donetsk to demand answers, in a rare public show of dissent. Two women who took part in the gathering said Alexander Malkovsky, the head of the DNR draft office, came out and told them that men aged 18 to 27 would be exempted from the draft. Reuters couldn't determine if this has been implemented, and was unable to reach Malkovsky. Two of the conscripts' wives said that since the gathering they learned from their partners that conditions had improved: some units were pulled back from the front line and allowed to sleep in abandoned homes, instead of in trenches.

4/5/2022,"Some conscripts to the Russian war effort from the Donbas region are turning on their commanders and refusing to fight on, after being handed antiquated rifles designed in the 19th century, and forced to drink from ponds littered with dead frogs. One student draftee was given an automatic weapon but no instructions on how to fire it. The student, speaking to Reuters, said he was ordered to repel an attack by Ukrainian forces, but told a reporter: “I don’t even know how to fire an automatic weapon.” ‘It’s a Sh*tshow’: Russian Troops Are Now Turning on Each Other The student said he was put in a mortar unit but was “taught nothing… Up to that point I had only seen mortars in movies. Obviously, I didn’t know how to do anything with them.” The wife of another untrained Donbas draftee told Reuters: “He doesn’t even really know how to hold an automatic weapon.” The report follows dozens of Western intelligence briefings and information shared by Ukrainian officials, which suggest that morale within the Russian forces is at breaking point and supply lines are a disaster. Last week, a Russian soldier was caught on tape lamenting the huge losses they were taking and complaining that the army was full of “morons.” “Our brigade has totally shit themselves. There are losses, many wounded,” he told his wife. “It’s unclear why we are even here,” he said. Ukraine has made advances in dozens of regions where Russian forces made initial inroads, revealing the true scale of the horror perpetrated in President Putin’s name. Reuters said that it spoke to six people for the report. In addition to the student it spoke to “three wives of conscripts who have mobile phone contact with their partners, one acquaintance of a draftee, and one source close to the pro-Russian separatist leadership who is helping to organize supplies for the Donbas armed forces.” Draftees from the separatist Donbas region are not part of the Russian army but are fighting alongside them. The overall picture that emerges from the report is of untrained and expendable conscripts providing ineffective support to their Russian counterparts. Reuters says Donbas conscripts “were given the highly dangerous mission of drawing enemy fire onto themselves so other units could identify the Ukrainian positions and bomb them.” The claim tallies with a video published by Ukraine on March 12 in which a prisoner of war, who said he was an untrained civil servant from Donbas, said he was ordered to draw enemy fire in Mariupol to give away Ukrainian positions. Reuters said that “several” of the draftees have been armed with bolt action Mosin rifles, which were first produced in the 1880s by the Russian Empire, and were the workhorse firearm of the Russian army for decades. Production ceased after World War II, however large stockpiles of the weapon survive. They were last manufactured, in small numbers, by Finland in 1973. Horrific New Details of Carnage in Ukraine Town Emerge The student conscript said: “It’s like we’re fighting with World War II muskets,” adding, “I hate the war. I don’t want it, curse it. Why are they sending me into a slaughterhouse?” In another episode that clearly illustrates weak morale, Reuters says a group of some 135 Donbas conscripts in Mariupol mutinied by putting down their weapons and refusing to continue to fight. The men were kept in a basement by their commanders before being released. The report also highlights the widely reported supply-line issues affecting the Russian war effort, with three sources saying draftees had to drink untreated water, and scavenge for food. “We drank water with dead frogs in it,” the student said, while a source described as being “close to the Donetsk separatist leadership” told Reuters: “Supplies for the soldiers right now are a disaster.” The Kremlin told Reuters that the issues raised were for the leadership of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) to answer.
