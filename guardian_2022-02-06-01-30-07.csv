2/6/2022,"The Scottish parliament has been commendably busy issuing pardons for some of the thousands of women convicted and killed during the Scottish witch trials of the 16th to 18th centuries. Scotland pursued the trials with especial vigour compared with other European countries, sentencing women (and some men) to death on charges of spell-casting, shape-shifting and fornication with Satan. Some were herbalists and healers, others mere beggars. Alongside the accounts of writer Mairi Kidd comes this tribute to the persecuted from a pair of accomplished Scottish musicians, harpist Rachel Newton (of the Shee and Spell Songs among others) and fiddler Lauren MacColl (of Salt House and chamber folk quartet Rant). It’s an appropriately haunting outing, with Newton’s spare, percussive harp complemented by MacColl’s fuller violin. The mood is largely sombre but not gloomy; the lives of the individual women in each song given dignity, with spoken word commentaries, in English and Gaelic, whispered into the mix. The effect is spectral (spooky if you like). Recorded on the island of Bernera, the album’s lightness also reflects the mists and moods of the Hebridean landscape. There are some upbeat touches for the fictional witches of Robert Burns in Tam O’Shanter, and for the legendary malevolent Gaelic being the Eachlair Ùrlar.

2/6/2022,"The financial market collapse at the start of 2020 was, on the face of it, a disaster for the world’s pension funds. The value of stocks and some bonds worth trillions of pounds plummeted as the extent and depth of the global recession caused by Covid lockdowns became clear. The UK’s biggest private pension scheme, the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), was no different: the custodian of the retirement savings of 470,000 university and college workers lost billions of pounds. At its latest valuation, actuaries came up with an alarming conclusion: the assets of USS were only worth £67bn, leaving a huge deficit of £18bn compared to the liabilities it has promised to pay out in the future.  Yet the recovery was almost as extraordinary as the decline. Central banks pumped money into the economy, and tech companies in the US recorded astonishing gains. That helped USS assets back to more than £90bn at the end of January. That recovery – and the controversial question of how the fund accounts for it – has put USS at the centre of a row that could result in university staff occupying picket lines across the country. The scheme will also be at the centre of a legal battle this month, with academics asking a court for permission to sue directors for not performing their duties. USS members come from more than 330 institutions, including the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Manchester and Birmingham. Among them are some of the country’s best economists – and they are putting their knowledge to use in the tussle with the trustees. All of which adds to the challenges faced by USS and its chief executive Bill Galvin. “Clearly it’s regrettable that employers and unions are finding it difficult to agree the way forward right now,” Galvin told the Observer, sitting in the USS offices next door to the Bank of England in the City of London, where the meeting rooms are all named after universities. The situation has been “pretty unavoidable” for the fund, he said, caught between regulatory requirements to cover the technical deficit and the subsequent increase in the value of those assets, which lowers the expectations for future returns. The employers and the trustees argue that they have no choice but to address the deficit by raising pension contributions for academics (many of whom are not particularly well paid), even at a time when the UK is grappling with a cost of living crisis. At the same time, the benefits members receive in retirement will also be cut. The University and College Union, which represents the staff, has put forward new proposals under which universities would contribute more and not cut retirement benefits, with the threat of strikes at 68 universities if talks fail. Hanging over it all is an important philosophical question on the approach to risk taken by pension funds. Ewan McGaughey, a reader in law at King’s College London, is among the claimants taking USS to court on 28 February to try to overturn a ruling that they do not have standing to sue. He argues that USS is making “absolutely indefensible assumptions” on its future returns. The academics’ case cites a USS technical paper that shows a 0% real return once inflation is taken into account. USS said it could not comment on ongoing legal proceedings. Professor Raghavendra Rau of the Cambridge Judge Business School argued that there is no precedent since at least 1900 – covering “two world wars, the great depression and the 1970s oil shock” – for such pessimism. Martin Wolf, the economic commentator at the Financial Times, has likened the USS approach to preparing for nuclear war (an observation that provoked weary laughs in USS’s offices). Yet it is not simply a case of academics on one side and the USS managers on the other. In a paper published in September, David Miles, professor of economics at Imperial College London and a former Bank of England monetary policymaker, and James Sefton, also an Imperial economics professor, argued that the risk of USS having insufficient funds to pay promised pensions was between 20% and 40%. Simon Pilcher, chief executive of USS Investment Management, is in charge of choosing the actual investments. “Sadly, one can’t project the past into the future,” he said. “Today, we think it is reasonable to expect lower returns going forward than we’ve experienced in the past, because it’s those higher returns that have driven us to these high prices.” USS’s view was that “we’re not obviously in a materially better position today”, but they were trying to be “prudent, rather than recklessly prudent”, Pilcher added – although the deficit had “shrunk” by an undisclosed amount. Galvin argues that the scheme has little choice because the Pensions Regulator (TPR) is “already slightly outside of its comfort zone” on what it will allow. “We certainly have taken the Pensions Regulator to a level where it believes that we’re taking as much risk as they believe we should,” said Galvin. “They believe, indeed, that we should be charging even slightly more, 1% to 2% more” for the employees’ pension contributions than is being proposed. The row reflects a deeper shift in who bears the risk of retirement income across the British economy. The classic pension model pools employees’ savings, paying out a defined benefit for as long as that person lives. However, rising life expectancy has made it harder for pensions to cover longer retirements, so many employers have moved to “defined contribution” pensions, which only give the benefit of whatever has been paid in (plus returns from the investments). That has shifted the risk to workers. USS is a hybrid, but will move further towards the defined contribution end if the employers and managers get their way. Galvin acknowledged it was “less generous”, but argued that “there is still a substantial amount of defined benefit”. Indeed, the 200,000 active USS members account for more than a fifth of the fewer than 1 million people in the UK who are still able to pay into defined benefit schemes. Pensions are always deeply concerned with existential matters: the more people who die early, the easier it is to meet their obligations. The climate crisis has added another dimension to this concern for the people managing the money. Now fund managers must weigh the probabilities of mass planet-wide death in a climate catastrophe, too. On this issue USS is also facing serious pressure from its highly educated members – a membership that happens to include some of the world’s leading experts on climate science. A campaign group, Divest USS, has pushed for the scheme to sell its shares in fossil fuel companies for several years. USS has tried to assuage academics’ concerns on the environment, including in a decision last month to “tilt” equities worth £5bn away from the worst polluters, cutting emissions of that part (albeit a relatively small one) of its portfolio by 30%. It has a formal target of net zero emissions from its portfolio companies by 2050 or sooner if possible. Yet Pilcher is clear that USS will not “exclude its way to net zero”, even as major counterparts such as Dutch pension fund ABP or Harvard University have done so. That suggests USS could continue to hold investments in oil companies such as BP and Shell for years to come, despite warnings from respected authorities that fossil fuel extraction needs to stop now. “Long-term capital such as ourselves needs to facilitate the change and the enormous investment that’s required for us as a country and as a globe to get to net zero,” Pilcher said. However, he argued that it would also be the “best investment strategy for our members” to “oversee the transition of businesses for the financial benefit of our members” – a nod to the uncomfortable fact that some fossil fuel businesses are likely to continue to offer financial returns for years. That argument could be tested in court. McGaughey, the claimant, said USS was “ignoring the members, ignoring the science, ignoring what is financial orthodoxy now”, that fossil fuel firms are likely to underperform broader markets. Even if USS can settle the row over the pension deficit in the next few months, those questions could dog the scheme for decades to come. One striking aspect of the Universities Superannuation Scheme’s investment approach is its enthusiastic embrace of the racy world of private equity investment. USS has direct ownership stakes in big infrastructure companies such as Heathrow Airport, the Moto motorway service stations, and Thames Water, the utility covering much of south-east England. This puts the scheme in an interesting position. While most pensions are invested in stocks and shares, USS is one of relatively few British pension managers putting the savings of low- and middle-income earners directly into private equity-style deals. Huge sections of the UK’s everyday economy, from Boots to Butlin’s, are now in private hands. Since the start of the pandemic, 1,200 companies worth more than £90bn have been acquired in private equity deals, in a shift which has seen big names such as the supermarket chain Morrisons depart the London Stock Exchange. Often, the dividends and profits of these businesses are shared only among those wealthy enough to afford the high upfront cost of investing in private equity funds. USS goes some way to redressing that imbalance. At the latest count, 28% of its assets were in private markets – including property, private equity and private fixed-income – across its vast portfolio. That includes £6.2bn of direct private equity investments (at March 2021 values) and direct loans to companies, including some from its £500m L1 Renewables arm, as well as investments in standard private equity funds run by giant firms such as TPG and CVC. Simon Pilcher, USS’s investment boss, said that he expected the proportion of private market assets to rise, potentially offering the scheme better returns. He also argues that pension funds such as USS make better owners than many private equity investors, who often extract value before selling companies on after about five years. Pension funds could, in theory, be willing to stick around for decades. Thames Water is a good example of where USS can be different, Pilcher believes. Previous owner Macquarie, the Australian investment bank, was condemned by critics during its period of ownership for allegedly aggressive value extraction, but USS is willing to make investments that will pay off slowly. Its representatives on Thames Water’s board successfully argued against paying a dividend in favour of making investments in its network or repairing leaks, Pilcher said. Spending to prevent universally reviled practices such as dumping sewage in rivers would eventually lead to better financial returns, he added. “We think of that as responsible capitalism,” he said. “We are the natural owners of an asset like that for the long term.” JJ",News/Business,Battle lines drawn over the future of UK’s biggest pension fund,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/05/battle-lines-drawn-over-the-future-of-uks-biggest-pension-fund
2/6/2022,"Two decades ago, the late and much-lamented David Bowie said something that was eerily prophetic. “Music itself,” he observed, “is going to become like running water or electricity.” His point was that in 2002 we were still carrying our music in little bottles called iPods, just as Victorian travellers in India carried bottles of drinking water because you couldn’t rely on their being a safe and sanitary public supply. Spool forward 20 years and Spotify, the Swedish audio streaming and media services provider founded in 2006 by Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon, is, in Bowie’s terms, the global music authority, providing sanitised recorded music everywhere, on demand. At the moment, it has something like 406 million active monthly users, of whom more than 180 million pay for its “premium” (advertising-free) service.  Given its dominance in the distribution of music, Spotify has inevitably been at the centre of controversies about the royalties musicians get paid for having their work streamed on the platform. In 2009, for example, it was reported that Lady Gaga’s hit song Poker Face had been streamed 1m times on Spotify, for which she received the princely royalty of $167! In May 2015, Spotify, seeing that Apple and Amazon were getting into the music streaming business, decided that it was also going to diversify into podcasts. And in May 2020 the company persuaded the popular American comedian Joe Rogan to move his podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, exclusively to Spotify in return for a reported $100m. In January this year, an episode of the Rogan show prompted an open letter signed by 270 health care professionals calling on Spotify to develop a counter-misinformation policy on the platform. The complainants especially objected to an episode that had featured Robert W Malone, a medical researcher whom Twitter had permanently suspended from its platform, citing “repeated violations of our Covid-19 misinformation policy”, together with a comment Rogan made where he stated that he believed that young, healthy people do not need a Covid-19 vaccine. At this point, Spotify experienced a sudden collision between its interests in music and podcasting. The musical superstar Neil Young gave the company an ultimatum: it could have his music or Joe Rogan’s podcast but not both. “I am doing this,” he wrote, “because Spotify is spreading fake information about vaccines, potentially causing death to those who believe the disinformation being spread by them.” Shortly afterwards, Joni Mitchell announced that she was taking the same line. Faced with these ultimatums, why did Spotify do? You only have to ask the question to know the answer. I mean to say, a hundred million bucks is a lot of money, even in the debased currency of the tech industry. And in his attempt to “manage” the controversy, Spotify’s co-founder Ek consulted the Facebook playbook. He vowed to provide “greater transparency” on the company’s content rules. And, of course, he wanted to support free speech – “while balancing it with the safety of our users”. And, just like Facebook, Spotify would henceforth be labelling content with warnings and directing users to a Covid-19 information hub with inputs from scientists and health experts. Etc, etc. There are, however, a couple of problems with this fatuous virtue-signalling. The first is what philosophers would call a category mistake – “assigning to something a quality or action which can only properly be assigned to things of another category”. Spotify is not Facebook. Whatever you might say about the latter, one thing it does not do is pay its users for what they post on its platform. Ek, on the other hand, has paid Joe Rogan $100m to broadcast from Spotify’s platform. Which makes him, I would say, a publisher and therefore someone not entitled to the legal protections enjoyed by Facebook, Twitter et al in the US. And on top of that, there is Ek’s naivety in thinking that labelling content about contentious matters is a way of doing good. From what we have learned so far about combating mis- and disinformation, labelling is as likely to boost bad stuff as it is to correct errors. So while Spotify may have succeeded in taming – or suborning – the mighty music industry, when it comes to handling political extremism and conspiracy theorists it’s clearly out of its depth.

2/6/2022,"Ilive by myself in a good place, the best sort of place a woman like me could imagine. In fact, it’s all I did imagine for years on end. I rent rather than own it, but that’s no hardship. I’ve never felt any particular angst to own property, which is just as well since I live in London, a place where I could no sooner get a mortgage than a giraffe. Owning a home has always felt more like a burden, like an end to things, to me, than it has felt like comfort. I did always dream, though, of renting somewhere beautiful and living alone there – and now I do. On the days I spend here without anyone else, I wake up at 8.30 and feed my cat. I watch her eat her disgusting, stinky food with satisfaction, glad I’m able to keep another creature beyond myself alive. I make coffee and wander about the flat a bit, wiping surfaces, washing tomato-laden pots. I go for a walk or to the gym, and then I work. I write. I send emails. I complain or speculate about everything I’m doing constantly to my friends. For lunch I blitz the vegetables in the fridge into a soup, or else walk down the road to the pub for a sandwich, and come back and work some more. I gaze adoringly at the cat. It becomes evening and I might drink a glass of wine, sometimes a bottle. I cook dinner and eat it in 13 minutes while watching MasterChef. I read for an hour. I work a bit more. Sometimes I watch a film. This is the life I have designed for myself, the life I never thought I would be so lucky as to have. Then it is time to sleep.  In my comfortable bed I read more and turn out the light and within 15 minutes I hear a jolt, a metallic clank outside in the garden. I reassure myself it’s just an animal. I try to sleep again. I drift off. Then there is the apparently unmistakable noise of the back door being jostled. I fly upward in my bed like the girl in The Exorcist, thrust into the air what feels like 2ft from pure fright, and once there and awake I keep completely still. Now, finally, it is happening. The comeuppance for my too-blessed life, for my choice to live alone. Something terrible is taking place. Another soft click from the direction of the front door. Now my entire body is flooded with adrenaline and my mouth arid. I try to recall through my panic the things I have done to mitigate the chances of an attack: the locks all double bolted, the keys taken out and placed far away so that if a person smashed through the glass they couldn’t easily open them. When I was terribly afraid one night I took a small sharp knife and hid it in a secret place accessible from where I sit in my bed. I can take it out without making much noise. There is another creak from the hallway, and I silently retrieve the blade from its hiding place and hold it in one hand and my phone in the other. I sit there like this, rigid with conviction and terror, for more than an hour. No thoughts pass through my head in this time apart from keen listening for the next noise and what direction it comes from, strategising my escape. Can I be sure they are coming from the area I think they are, or could they be coming from both sides? Is it wise to lock myself in a toilet? Am I strong and small enough to break through that window if necessary? Eventually, I accept that I am too frightened to move to check whether someone is outside my bedroom door one way or the other, and that the elapsed time means that it is unlikely they are there. I put the knife back in its place and turn on the two lamps on either side of my bed, and a podcast so that it might sound to somebody outside that there are several people in this room. I lie back down and practise some breathing exercises to try to sleep. It’s now perhaps 4am and I have lost half of my allotted rest. I am useless and angry when I wake up, aware of the absurdity of my fear and that I have allowed it, by indulging, to ruin my day. This happens two, three, sometimes four times a month. Twice as many times as that I am woken in the middle of the night with dreams that somebody is entering my window or sitting on my bed, terrors which are both more and less intense because they are unconscious, but which mean just the same that my sleep is robbed and fragmented, my body feeling as if it has been through a battle when it wakes in the morning. I have always been what could kindly be described as “nervy”. I panic inordinately, reacting with huge exaggeration to ordinary aural surprises. Sirens, shouts, my boyfriend gasping, “Oh my God!” when he looks at his phone (Spurs were down one nil). Ghost trains, even the most comically amateur, were not something I could tolerate as a child. When I hear a fox rustling in the garden or see a flash outside in the dark – the light of my own bathroom – the momentary fright I get is so ludicrously powerful, and so physically so, that the rest of the night spirals. But why? Why am I like this, so susceptible and easily overwhelmed? Do I truly believe it’s likely that a prowling man is going to break in through my window to hurt me? I read voraciously about Ted Bundy as an adolescent, the first of the iconic American monsters to catch my attention. I picked up Ann Rule’s pulpy book, The Stranger Beside Me, at a school jumble sale and pored over it with appalled titillation. Sometimes he approached his victims in daylight and in public places, car parks and beaches, but his first few were women asleep in their beds – women in basement apartments like mine. I spent the subsequent 15 years consuming true crime with unattractive compulsion. There was Unbelievable in 2019, the Netflix show based on the true story of a serial rapist who broke into apartments and attacked his victims as they slept. He lectured one woman smugly about the inadequate safety measures which had left her open to his predation. The show sparked conversation among women about their terror of solitude, the exhausting knowledge of their own perpetual vulnerability. All my life I have loved to walk alone at night. As a teenager making my first clumsy forays into pubs and partying, the walk home with my Discman was often the part I prized most. The processing and the narrativising were better than the experiences themselves. I take an admittedly thick and wrongheaded pride in the fact I feel no fear about doing this, that I don’t let tragic stories – about women attacked in circumstances like those I willingly embrace – change my behaviour. I like to think I have mostly refused to let the potential evil of the world hamper my freedom. This makes the sporadic paralysing fear which overcomes me in the safety of my own bed all the more humiliating and ridiculous. Message boards and articles describe women who keep muddy men’s boots outside their doors to intimidate intruders, who sleep with hammers under their pillows, who tell nobody that they live alone and put male names on their delivery orders. They have intricate set-ups involving bells strung up to alert them if the window is jarred. I thought I was a different sort of person to this, one able to operate within reason, according to the actual likelihood of harm rather than intangible bogeyman, but it turns out I am not. Does my submersion in true crime shows and books, in the extraordinary and rare stories of famous sadistic crimes, mean I believe they are more likely to happen to me than they are? Or is it that the knowledge of such things ever happening warps us; that they could take place even once in the history of humankind, that it is possible for a person to enjoy another’s pain to this degree? Maybe that knowledge stretches the mind to encompass more oblique danger than it can accommodate; more than logic can successfully deny. Beyond the literal, material sadistic intruders I fear when I am in my spirals, there is something bigger and more difficult to define. They suggest a mass of malevolence and ill fortune of which they constitute only one small part. In my waking life I do not believe that someone is going to break into my home as I sleep and commit acts of violence against me. In the moment, something else is taking place. It’s the feeling of all future disaster encroaching in the indifferent calm of the dark, my thoughts unfettered in the pre-dawn hours turning invariably to death. In our irony-exhausted culture it feels almost laughable to say it plainly, but I’ll say it all the same: night is when I really burrow down into the knowledge that everyone I know is going to die. Sometimes I consider them one by one, every person I love and the different ways they might go, which circumstance I could learn to bear, which ones would drive me mad. It’s a lonely and ultimately inconsolable despair to find oneself wading through in the wee hours. Perhaps it’s easier to focus on an errant creak, the possibility of intrusion. Perhaps, too, this is why the feeling of my boyfriend in bed beside me is such an efficient remedy. Not because he can fight off monsters any better than I can, no offence to his prowess, but because it is easier to disbelieve the truth of death when I can hold on to some other creature who is living and beautiful and strong, someone so bright and apparently infinite that it would surely be impossible for them to ever die. I have become worse rather than better since beginning this relationship. When I was always alone I rarely reached such high pitches of fear. I rarely noted my solitude at all; there was no other way to live. Now that there is one, now that nights alone are mostly optional, I struggle. I say goodbye to him on a Sunday evening, dread filling my chest, and I know that if I asked, then he would stay or I would go with him, and I have to forge agreements with myself not to do so. I battle as I always have done between the force of my need for others and the force of my disgust towards dependence. I suspect I will have to grapple with those competing interests for the rest of my life. I can’t accept that I need another person to do something as basic and necessary as sleep. It would be too dangerous to concede such total reliance. Instead, I push through on the nights I am alone and afraid. When sleep evades me totally I wait until dawn comes, slip on my headphones and walk out into the streets. There, no matter how early it is, I see that life exists, cyclists and bedraggled revellers and the train station coffee shop setting up. I listen to music or to a podcast about something amazing, something that happened in a place I’ve never been to but could travel to one day if I really wanted to. I am glad that wandering outside is where I feel safest and happiest, because here I’m reminded of how much I love the world and the people in it and everything I don’t know about them, and that whatever fear I feel on my own is only a kind of proof of how strong that feeling is. On these mornings I am filled with the sure knowledge of the ongoingness of things and how miraculous that really is, and that knowledge is just as real, or even more so, as the knowledge of endings which comes in the dark.

2/6/2022,"This might have passed you by, what with all the other news to savour/slog through/weep over, but Ken Bruce is now the most popular DJ in the UK. Yes, that Ken Bruce. The gently avuncular Radio 2 mid-morning veteran bagged the highest number of listeners in the latest Rajars (the official measure of radio audiences). Bruce’s station compadre, Zoe Ball, also did well: with 7.5 million listeners, she hosts the most popular breakfast show in the country. But that’s just a warm-up for the biggest radio show out there. Bruce’s 9.30am-12.00pm weekday programme is listened to by 8.7 million people, 1.2 million more than Ball; the largest audience on UK radio.  The 71-year-old has been at the helm of his show for 32 years (apart from a two-year hiatus between 1990 and 1992), so this lurch into the limelight might seem a surprise. Bruce is used to playing second fiddle to larger personalities (the much-adored Terry Wogan, bumptious Chris Evans). But times have changed, and audiences too. The 1990s rave/indie generation have got older, cast aside their cool and remembered their love of classic pop. If they’re spooked by Radio 6 Music’s recent changes, or irritated by commercial radio’s unadventurous playlist, then the non-annoying parts of Radio 2 remain. And Bruce manages not to annoy most people. Which might sound like faint praise but isn’t. “What I like about him,” says one devoted fan, “is that he doesn’t do irritating gush. He doesn’t talk over the tracks. He respects the music, you can tell.” There are other factors. The pandemic has changed morning listening habits. The peak time for radio listening (around 8am) has become less of a peak, more of a table-top that plateaus from 8am to 10.30am. Home-schooling and a lack of commute during the first, March 2020, lockdown started this trend, and radio schedules were rejigged to reflect our indoor lives. Schedules have been back to normal since autumn 2020 but listeners’ habits haven’t completely shifted. (Bruce’s show isn’t the only mid-morning affair that’s now bigger than breakfast: on LBC, for the first time ever, James O’Brien’s 10am-1pm show narrowly beat Nick Ferrari’s breakfast show listener figures.) The pandemic also highlighted listeners’ desire for warm, comfort-radio, at which Bruce excels. His rumbly Scottish tones might have some people running for the off button (“too smooth”, “too golf club”, “the precise accent of a middle class geography teacher who’s very disappointed in your efforts this year”, according to some non-lovers), but his energy is more upbeat than you might expect, his timing crisp, and many find him soothing. More: they actively respect his presenting style. “He’s a real DJ,” says long-time fan Bob Stanley, from Saint Etienne (the band like Bruce so much that they featured him on their 2017 album Home Counties). “It’s what he’s always done. Radio 2 has had a move towards celebrities being DJs for a few years now, and they can grow into the job, but this is what Ken Bruce does and he’s really good at it.” Off air, Bruce is acknowledged as a good guy: a friend who’s written jokes for Radio 2 says he’s “very up for a laugh”, and a sound engineer who worked across Radio 2 and Radio 4 for 20 years informs that he is universally liked at the BBC. On air, Bruce is noticeably good at dealing with the public, especially during Popmaster, the hugely successful pop quiz on every weekday between 10.30 and 11am. What do you mean, you don’t know Popmaster? There are spin-off books and board games. Just type #popmaster into Twitter to see how popular it is. People stop work to play along with a cup of tea, they write down their daily scores; they have family Whatsapp groups to compare results. Some of them even enter, and play live on the show against another listener, to win a DAB radio, plus a great deal of music-nerd kudos. Many don’t do as well as they’d hope. A friend tells me, with some sadness: “My average is 33, but when I went on I only got 24. I was beaten by a very difficult tie break.” The Fall’s Paul Hanley has Popmastered (he got 21). When I tell Stanley that a mutual chum has been on Popmaster twice and won both times, he is noticeably impressed. And, you know, once you’re Popmastering, you may well start listening to the whole show, and start clocking the more-out-there-than-you-might-imagine music choices (the Kursaal Flyers, Boz Scaggs, the Babys). Join the millions who are grateful he’s still there, gently Ken-ing on. As another friend says (I never knew so many mates were Ken Bruce fans before writing this): “He’s always been there. Steady, reliable, upbeat, charming, self-deprecating and never a show-off. That consistency, especially during the pandemic, means a lot to us.”",News/Media,How Radio 2 veteran Ken Bruce became a No 1 hit,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/05/how-radio-2-veteran-ken-bruce-became-a-no-1-hit
2/6/2022,"On a thrilling, boisterous Saturday afternoon it took Chelsea 105 minutes, 39 shots, 19 corners and 670 passes to finally take the lead against Plymouth. These are the kind of numbers that suggest a pasting, a hammering, fourth round FA Cup minnows hanging on by their toenails. But this was something else entirely, a 2-1 victory for Chelsea, but a day when Plymouth came to compete, played neat, disciplined, counterattacking football and really might have won this game. Deep into extra time they were spanking in shots at the Chelsea goal looking to force a shoot-out.  Chelsea’s occasional problems are clear enough, a well calibrated passing and pressing machine that seems at times to be lulling itself to sleep. But Plymouth were a great tribute to the enduring strength and professionalism of the lower tiers, and a huge credit to their manager, Steve Schumacher, who only sounds like a disciple of the Ralf Rangnick atelier, but is in reality from Liverpool. To offer some perspective, Plymouth are seventh in League One. Their record signing is £500,000, which translates into two weeks of Timo Werner in west London. As the game meandered through extra time, Chelsea had Romelu Lukaku, Kai Havertz, Werner and Hakim Ziyech on the pitch, a combined £280m of attacking talent, and all certainly standing quite near one another. Plymouth even had time to miss a penalty five minutes from the end of extra time, as Malang Sarr brought down Ryan Hardie, only for Hardie to see a poor effort well saved by Kepa Arrizabalaga. The Plymouth end was a stirring sight at the start of the day, a sizeable portion of Devon packed into the full double-decker and generating a deep surge of lunchtime noise as the players went across to wave before kick off. And the Bridge was a lovely soft sunny spring-like place at kick off, as the game began in a mild lunchtime doze. At which point something wonderful happened. There were seven minutes gone when Plymouth won a free kick out on the left touchline. The ball was swung in with good speed at a tempting angle by Jordan Houghton. Macaulay Gillesphey jumped, unmarked, to flick the ball on into the corner, unhindered either by close attention from Chelsea’s centre backs or by any real show of interest from Arrizabalaga, who stood on his line and watched when he might have come and flapped. To be fair, he probably expected a first line of defence. There was unfenced joy in the green end, a startled roar that just kept on rumbling on, bodies tumbling across the aisles. It was also an outstanding little snapshot in time for Houghton, who never quite made it on to this pitch as a senior Chelsea player, but who will now always have that moment. Plymouth continued to push forward, set up in a deep back five, but ready to overlap on the flanks when the moment presented itself. Panutche Camará had a shot blocked by Malang Sarr. It took 15 minutes for Chelsea to being to assert their possession game. “Champions of Europe, you’re having a laugh,” the Plymouth end sang. Thomas Tuchel tested positive for Covid-19 before the game. In his absence the role of angry pointing track-suited tactical rainmaker was filled by Arno Michels. Tuchel is a one-man touchline melodrama. But it would be hard to blame his absence here. Chelsea were simply vague. Half chances sort of came and went. Callum Hudson-Odoi headed on to the bar at the back post. Mateo Kovacic had already hit the woodwork after a burst through the centre. Ten minutes before half time he pinged a shot low and hard on to the foot of the post after another surge down the right, Chelsea’s most profitable route to goal. Was this going to be one of those days where people talk about One of Those Days? The pressure was always likely to bear fruit. Although, perhaps not quite like this. Once again Mason Mount found just enough space to cross. In the centre Cesar Azpilicueta conjured a craftsman’s finish, the Lee Sharp-style wrong-foot instep flick taking the ball past Mike Cooper. Chelsea set off at a sprint in the second half, forcing corners, pressing constantly around the fringes of the Plymouth goal. Hudson-Odoi continued to find space, so nimble in his movements, but so lacking in viciousness near goal. He really should have scored on 53 minutes after a lovely run, but produced a flaccid side-foot shot. There was pressure from Chelsea but little cutting edge or even anything resembling an opening. Romelu Lukaku did not particularly stand out in this company, his touch a little blunt, movement unimaginative. Ryan Hardie had a sight of goal, put through in space on the left flank, but Kepa was able to smother his finish. Hooper made a wonderful save to parry away Mount’s shot after a fine lay off from Lukaku, who often shows his best stuff taking the ball with movement around him. Otherwise Chelsea continued to weave indistinct patterns, keeping the ball, dominating the territory, racking up blocked shots and half-openings. It is often a struggle for teams that play at this tempo, where your own command of possession can become a problem to be untangled. At times what Chelsea really seem to need is a good version of Timo Werner, an attacker with all the movement, the speed, the ability to work in small spaces, but also the ability to finish ruthlessly, or indeed, at all. Werner entered the fray here with nine minutes to play. In the last minute of the game he sprang forward on to a nudged through pass and with space running out seemed to duck out of taking the shot, or even going anywhere near the ball as the cover slid across. The final whistle and the prospect of extra time brought another vast cheer from the Plymouth end, by this stage in a state of constant boisterous approval of every act on the pitch. Finally, just before half time in extra time, Chelsea found their opening. It came down the left, where Havertz found space by the touchline to pull back a low cross. Marcos Alonso had made the run inside, and had time and space to slip the ball easily past Hooper.",Sport/Football,Marcos Alonso extra-time winner saves Chelsea against battling Plymouth,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/05/chelsea-plymouth-fa-cup-match-report
2/6/2022,"As the weeks wear on following No 10’s “partygate” scandal and the number of Conservative MPs urging Boris Johnson to go continues to climb, one person has emerged as the prime minister’s most loyal defender. Nadine Dorries, undeterred by two new calls for Johnson to resign and fresh reports that police have a photograph of the PM holding a can of Estrella at his lockdown birthday party, leapt to his defence on Saturday in a series of bizarre interviews.  Among the highlights of the culture secretary’s morning airwaves blitz was an excruciatingly awkward interview with BBC Breakfast presenter Charlie Stayt, in which Dorries refused to say whether she had spoken to the prime minister recently. Speaking live from Gloucestershire, she would only reveal that she had “communicated” with Johnson. In a stilted combative exchange reminiscent of Donald Trump’s former adviser Kellyanne Conway, she reprimanded Stayt for his questioning style. Asked whether she had spoken to the prime minister recently in the past 24 hours, she said: “Why? Why are you asking me that question?” When he responded that he “would like to know”, she would only divulge that they had “communicated”. In response to a question about Johnson’s mood, she said it was “extremely positive” and revealed that “onwards is one of his favourite expressions”. When asked whether he had changed, she asked: “Changed what?” “His attitude,” said Stayt. To which Dorries responded: “To what?” On the subject of Johnson’s claims about employment numbers, she insisted that Johnson tells the truth “to the best of his knowledge” – based on advice given to him by his aides. “So did he tell the truth when he quoted that? Yes, he told the truth as it was given to him,” she said. On to BBC Radio 4’s Today where she proceeded to mix up the names of Tory MPs Martin and Matt Vickers. Asked about the 2019 intake of Red Wall MPs, she started talking about a Martin Vickers, who she said is “up in the far north of England in South Tees” and recently appeared on Channel 4 News in support of the prime minister. In fact she appeared to be talking about Matt Vickers, MP for Stockton South in the Tees Valley, who on Wednesday told the programme: “Teesside’s got a lot to be happy about.” She then moved on to Times Radio where she suggested dissenters of the prime minister were part of a remainer plot. “There are a small number of voices, whether they are people who were ardent supporters of remain, who see this as their last opportunity to reverse Brexit,” she said. Asked whether moves against Johnson were part of a “remainer plot,” she said: “That certainly is at play with a group.” Meanwhile, in an interview with Sky News, she insisted that “97%” of Tory MPs support the prime minister and that the health secretary, Sajid Javid, was “100%” behind Johnson, despite seeking to distance himself from his false claims about Keir Starmer failing to prosecute Jimmy Savile. Once again she reprimanded a journalist, telling Niall Paterson: “I’m not a random backbencher.”",News/Politics,Nadine Dorries rides the airwaves to back PM amid ‘partygate’ row,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/05/nadine-dorries-rides-the-airwaves-to-back-pm-amid-partygate-row
