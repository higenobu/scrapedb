4/26/2022,"One thing is clear in the current market conditions: it’s a time of transition. Over the past four months, the stock market has shifted from the bull run we saw in 2021 into a far more volatile state of affairs. The market dipped into correction territory in March, bounced back out in April, and now is heading down again. One result of this has been an increase in bond yields, as equities have dropped. And with the Federal Reserve embarking on a new round of interest rate hikes, that promises a move toward higher yields. Weighing in on current market conditions, Morgan Stanley chief European equity strategist Graham Secker noted, ""There’s a plausible argument that equity valuations had already derated in advance of this move and that the rise in real yields has simply recoupled the two series back together. Hence, if real yields move higher from here, equities will need to derate further.” Secker’s outlook, if taken at face value, makes it plain that investor will need to take defensive measures to protect their portfolios. Any farmer can tell you that there’s no point slamming the barn door after the horses have bolted, and the same holds true for stocks. The best time to shore up the portfolio is before the worst becomes obvious. With this in mind, we've used the TipRanks database to pinpoint two stocks that match a solid defensive profile: a Strong Buy from the analyst’s collective wisdom and a dividend yield of 7% or more. Let's take a closer look. OneMain Holdings (OMF) We’ll start with OneMain, a financial services company with a twist. OneMain focuses its efforts on the low-end retail customer segment, offering affordable loans, consumer finance, and insurance products. This is a customer base that won’t necessarily qualify for credit services from larger banking companies, due to higher risk factors and lower credit scores. OneMain, however, sees this as a lucrative potential market. The company’s revenue stream would tend to indicate that OneMain is correct in its assessment of the customer base. In the past two years, the quarterly top line has been consistently high, between $1.2 billion and $1.28 billion. The last reported quarter, 4Q21, was at the top of that range, and was up 5% year-over-year. Quarterly EPS came in at $2.38, down from $2.77 in the year-ago quarter. On the positive side, EPS came in just above the $2.35 forecast – and marked the 7th consecutive quarter that the bottom line beat the estimates. For the full year 2021, OneMain reported $9.87 in earnings per share, a strong increase from the $5.41 per share reported for the full year in 2020. Overall, management was pleased with the 4Q earnings, and expressed that confidence through a 36% increase in the quarterly common share dividend. This payment was bumped up to 95 cents per share, and was paid out in February of this year. With an annualized payment of $3.80, OneMain’s dividend yields 8%. In coverage for Wells Fargo, 5-star analyst Michael Kaye notes that recession fears have put pressure on OneMain’s stock price recently, but points to a relatively sound position for US consumers – OneMain’s key customer base – as reason for optimism on the stock. “OneMain shares (along with the consumer finance sector) have been weak on recession fears exacerbated by inflation/higher energy prices. While this certainly contributes to downside risks to the U.S. economy, our belief is that we will avoid tipping into a recession. We think the backdrop for the U.S. consumer remains solid driven in part by a strong employment picture. Thus, we think recession risk ultimately fades, and we view the current share price as a buying opportunity,” Kaye opined. In line with this comments, Kaye rates OMF stock an Overweight (i.e. Buy), with a $70 price target that indicates room for ~41% upside in the coming year. (To watch Kaye’s track record, click here) While upbeat, Kaye’s take on OneMain in certainly not an outlier – this stock has a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating, supported by 6 positive analyst reviews. The shares are priced at $46.09 and their $66.33 average price target suggests an upside of 44% for the year ahead. (See OMF stock forecast on TipRanks) Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) The second stock we’ll look at is a midstream energy company. Like the finance sector, the energy sector has long been known for offering high dividends. Enterprise Products Partners supports its own dividend with operations in the collection, transport, storage, processing, and export of hydrocarbon products, including crude oil, refined petroleum, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. High prices in the energy sector over the past year and more have supported Enterprise’s stock price; where the S&P 500 is down 12.5% year-to-date, EPD stock has gained 20% in that same time. Enterprise moved to increase its asset network recently, and in January the company announced that it had entered an agreement to acquire Navitas Midstream. This move brought more than 1,700 pipeline miles and over 1 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas processing capabilities into Enterprise’s network. The transaction cost Enterprise $3.25 billion in cash, and was completed in February. The company’s revenues have been consistently increasing, with 5 sequential gains since bottoming out in 2Q20. The last quarter reported was 4Q21, in which the top line came in at $11.65 billion, up 65% year-over-year. Quarterly EPS was 47 cents, missing the 54-cent forecast but more than tripling y/y. For the full year 2021, Enterprise reported $4.6 billion in net income, delivering an EPS of $2.10 per share. These full-year results were up significantly from the 2020 figures, with net income growing 21% and full year EPS growing 22%. Of particular interest to dividend investors, Enterprise’s free cash flow in 2021 grew y/y from $2.7 billion to $6.3 billion. This is the metric that supports the dividend, and earlier this month Enterprise declared its next common share dividend payment at 46.5 cents, payable on May 12. This payment annualizes to $1.86 and gives a yield of 7%. Enterprise has a long history, 13 years, of slowing growing its common share dividend payment. Justin Jenkins, 5-star analyst with Raymond James, is bullish on Enterprise, writing: “EPD's unique combination of asset integration, balance sheet strength, and ROIC track record remains best in class. Further, said track record is more relevant than ever in the context of the recent Navitas deal. We see EPD as arguably best positioned in midstream from a volatility vs. recovery perspective — and buybacks remain an upside lever in 2022+. Meanwhile, EPD still trades at an attractive ~7% yield and a historically discounted ~9.5x 2023E EV/EBITDA (~11.5x 5-year average).” ""With a healthy outlook and a compelling entry point,"" Jenkins rates EPD a Strong Buy along with a $30 price target. Shares could appreciate ~17%, should the analyst’s thesis play out in the coming months. (To watch Jenkins’ track record, click here) Wall Street is in broad agreement with the bull here, as evidenced by the 7 to 2 split in the recent share reviews, favoring Buys over Holds and backing a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock is selling for $25.70 and the $30.13 average target is practically the same as Jenkins' objective.

4/26/2022,"In the week ending April 21, 2022, mortgage rates rose for a seventh consecutive week. 30-year fixed rates rose by 11 basis points to 5.11%. 30-year fixed rates jumped by 28 basis points in the week prior. Year-on-year, 30-year fixed rates were up by 214 basis points. 30-year fixed rates were up by 17 basis points since November 2018’s last peak of 4.94%. There were no material stats from the US for the markets to consider in the first half of the week. The lack of stats left mortgage rates in the hands of market sentiment towards inflation and Fed monetary policy. Continued concerns over the impact of supply chain disruption on inflation drove Treasury yields higher ahead of a scheduled Fed Chair Powell speech on Thursday. The weekly average rates for new mortgages, as of April-21, 2022, were quoted by Freddie Mac to be: 30-year fixed rates increased by 11 basis points to 5.11% in the week. This time last year, rates had stood at 2.97%. The average fee remained unchanged at 0.8 points. 15-year fixed rates surged by 21 basis points to 4.38% in the week. Rates were up by 209 basis points from 2.29% a year ago. The average fee fell from 0.9 points to 0.8 points. 5-year fixed rates increased by 6 basis points to 3.75%. Rates were up by 92 basis points from 2.83% a year ago. The average fee remained unchanged at 0.3 points. According to Freddie Mac, Mortgage rates increased for a seventh consecutive week, driven by the upward trend in Treasury yields. The surge in rates has impacted demand at the traditionally busiest time of the homebuying season. Buyers who remain interested in purchasing a home may find more moderate competition. For the week ending April 15, 2022, the rates were: Average interest rates for 30-year fixed with conforming loan balances rose from 5.13% to 5.20%. Points increased from 0.63 to 0.66 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. Average 30-year fixed mortgage rates backed by FHA increased from 4.95% to 5.11%. Points rose from 0.75 to 0.90 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. Average 30-year rates for jumbo loan balances increased from 4.68% to 4.76%. Points rose from 0.37 to 0.46 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. Weekly figures released by the Mortgage Bankers Association showed that the Market Composite Index, a measure of mortgage loan application volume, decreased by 5% in the week ending April-15. The Index declined by 1% in the previous week. The Refinance Index fell by 8% and was 68% lower than the same week one year ago. In the week prior, the Index fell by 5%. The refinance share of mortgage activity decreased from 37.1% to 35.7% of total applications. In the previous week, the share fell from 40.6% to 37.1%. According to the MBA, Concerns about rapid inflation and tighter US monetary policy continued to push Treasury yields higher. Mortgage rates hit their highest level in over a decade. 30-year fixed rates have jumped 70 basis points over the past month and sit two full percentage points higher than a year ago. The upswing in rates has pushed out borrowers, causing the refinance Index to fall for a sixth consecutive week. Amidst affordability challenges and low inventory in the housing market, buyers are pulling back or delaying home purchases. From the US, core durable goods and consumer confidence figures will draw attention on Tuesday. Expect consumer confidence to have more influence on yields. While the stats will provide direction, the markets will also track crude oil prices, news updates from China on lockdown measures, and the war in Ukraine. Sentiment towards supply chain disruption remains a key consideration for inflation.

4/26/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- The S&P 500 is about to drop sharply, Morgan Stanley’s Michael J. Wilson warned, as investors struggle to find havens amid fears of a recession and aggressive tightening by the Federal Reserve.

In our experience, when that happens, it usually means the overall index is about to fall sharply with almost all stocks falling in unison.” The S&P 500 Index has slumped for three weeks in a row, sinking to the lowest level since mid-March on Friday as investors fled risk assets amid fears of rapid monetary tightening and its impact on economic growth. Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s endorsement of aggressive actions to curb inflation sent traders racing to price in half-percentage-point interest-rate increases at the bank’s next four meetings. Morgan Stanley strategists said a quickly tightening Fed is looking “right into the teeth of a slowdown” and that while defensive positioning has worked well since November, they don’t see more upside for these stocks as their valuations have swelled. At the same time, the strategists said that large-cap pharma and biotech shares’ defensive characteristics make them consistent outperformers in an environment of slowing earnings growth, decelerating PMIs and tighter monetary policy. “As the U.S. economy moves to a late cycle phase and GDP/earnings growth rates decelerate for the overall economy and market, we think Pharma/Biotech’s defensive properties will outweigh policy concern and drive relative performance higher,” they wrote.
