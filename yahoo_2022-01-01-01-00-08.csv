1/1/2022,"Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin spoke on Thursday as Russia appeared close to invading Ukraine. Putin told Biden that sanctions over Ukraine could mean a total rupture in US-Russia relations. Biden urged Putin to ease tensions but said the US would respond if Russia invades. Russian President Vladimir Putin warned President Joe Biden in a phone call on Thursday that relations between the two countries could collapse if the US imposes sanctions on Russia over its actions in Ukraine. The Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said after the call that Putin told Biden that sanctions ""could lead to a complete breakdown in ties between our countries,"" Reuters reported. ""Our president also mentioned that it would be a mistake that our descendants would see as a huge error,"" he said. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday that Biden told Putin that Russia needed to ""de-escalate tensions with Ukraine."" She said Biden warned that the US would respond if Russia presses ahead with a Ukraine invasion. ""President Biden reiterated that substantive progress in these dialogues can occur only in an environment of de-escalation,"" she said. ""He made clear that the United States and its allies and partners will respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine."" According to Axios, a senior US official said that Biden also said the US and its allies could couple sanctions with increased NATO activity in eastern member states. NATO operations in countries like Estonia and Latvia, which border Russia, have long frustrated Putin. He recently demanded that NATO leave eastern Europe altogether. The US, Ukraine, and their allies are warning that Russia appears to be preparing to invade Ukraine, its neighbor, soon. Russia has been building up troops and military equipment along the border. Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula in 2014. Russia also supports armed separatists in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. The war between Russian-backed rebels and Ukrainian troops has killed more than 13,000 people in recent years.

1/1/2022,"(Adds quotes, context) By Vladimir Soldatkin MOSCOW, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday warned his U.S. counterpart Joe Biden in a call that new Western sanctions against Moscow could rupture ties between Russia and the United States and would be a big mistake, the Kremlin said. But Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters Russia was satisfied with the phone conversation which he said centred on security guarantees that Moscow wants from the West amid a build-up of Russian forces close to the Ukrainian border. Ushakov said Biden appeared to agree that Moscow needed such guarantees and seemed serious about negotiations even if differences remained and the outline of a possible compromise was so far unclear. Russia has alarmed Western countries by massing tens of thousands of troops near its border with Ukraine in the past two months. Moscow denies planning to attack Ukraine and says it has the right to move its troops on its own soil as it sees fit. The United States has repeatedly warned Moscow it will impose devastating sanctions if Russia launches a new attack on Ukraine, a threat Ushakov said Biden had repeated on Thursday. Ushakov said Putin had told Biden that such a move could lead to a breakdown in U.S.-Russia ties. ""Our president immediately responded (to the sanctions threat) that if the West decides in this or other circumstances to impose these unprecedented sanctions which have been mentioned then that could lead to a complete breakdown in ties between our countries and cause the most serious damage to relations between Russia and the West,"" said Ushakov. ""Our president also mentioned that it would be a mistake that our descendants would see as a huge error."" Moscow, worried by what it says is the West's re-arming of Ukraine, has said it wants legally-binding guarantees from the NATO military alliance over its eastern expansion and weapons deployment. Russia is set to hold talks on the guarantees it is seeking with the U.S. in Geneva on Jan. 10, with NATO in Brussels on Jan. 12, and under the auspices of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Vienna on Jan. 13. Ushakov said Thursday's phone call had created what he called a good atmosphere ahead of those talks. Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea in 2014 and backed a pro-Russian separatist uprising that same year which saw Kyiv lose control over a swath of eastern Ukraine.
