4/21/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Thursday that Moscow was still waiting for Ukraine's response to Russia's latest written proposal in peace talks between the two sides, and questioned why Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was unaware of the document. Zelenskiy said on Wednesday he had not seen or heard about the text the Kremlin said it had sent. ""I repeat once again, as I said yesterday, our formulations, in fact the latest version, were handed to our opponents, to the Ukrainian negotiating delegation,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Peskov said the Kremlin was aware of Zelenskiy's comment, ""which also raises certain questions about why no one is reporting to President Zelenskiy about our versions of the text"". The comments from the two sides appeared to highlight both the gulf in their positions and the poor state of communication between them, eight weeks after Russia sent its troops and tanks into Ukraine and more than three weeks after they last held face-to-face talks on March 29. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on April 12 that the talks had come to a dead end. Ukraine's chief negotiator said on Tuesday it was hard to predict when they might resume because of Russia's siege of Mariupol and what he said was Moscow's desire to strengthen its position through a new military offensive. Russia says it was forced to launch its ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine, and protect Russian-speakers there from ""genocide"" - arguments denounced by Kyiv and the West as baseless pretexts for war. Moscow wants Kyiv to accept the loss of Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and of the eastern Donbas region which is now the focus of the Russian offensive. Ukraine says it will not compromise on its sovereignty and territorial integrity.

4/21/2022,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Winter storm warnings were set to start going into effect along California’s mountainous eastern spine Wednesday as a new cold front approached. The system is the latest in a series of spring storms that has followed a dry winter that left California deep in drought. Widespread rain, heavy mountain snow and periods of gusty winds were predicted to begin Wednesday afternoon and last into Friday, possibly spreading showers down into Southern California, the National Weather Service said. “This system continues to look like a very good late-season precipitation event for the region,” the Sacramento weather office wrote. Higher elevations were expected to receive at least 1 foot to 2 feet of snow. Rainfall predictions ranged up to 3 inches, with possibly higher amounts if thunderstorms develop. Winter storm warnings were scheduled to start going into effect from the Oregon border down through the southern Cascades and northern Sierra Nevada. Travelers were likely to face whiteout conditions, road closures and chain controls, forecasters said. “Any Sierra driving will be treacherous after today. It would be a good idea to delay non-essential travel until conditions improve,” the Reno, Nevada, weather office wrote. “If this isn’t possible, be sure to carry chains and winter survival supplies in your vehicle.” Wind gusts of 50 mph, and up to 80 mph across Sierra ridges, will make for difficult travel, NWS reports, with long delays and possible highway closures over mountain passes likely. “The hazardous conditions will impact the morning and evening commutes Thursday into Friday,” according to the winter storm warning. “Strong winds and heavy snow accumulations could damage tree limbs and produce power outages. ""Avoid travel if possible, (as) you could be stuck in your vehicle for many hours with conditions similar to mid-winter storms. If you must travel, prepare for long delays and carry an emergency kit with extra food, water and clothing. If you stay home, have a backup plan in case of power outages.” The Sierra Avalanche Center is also issuing a backcountry avalanche watch between Yuba Pass (Highway 49) on the north and Ebbetts Pass (Highway 4) on the south, including the greater Lake Tahoe area from 4 p.m. Wednesday through 4 p.m. Friday. “A winter storm bringing feet of new snow and strong winds may result in widespread avalanche activity in the mountains. Heavy snow loading could cause large and destructive avalanches,” according to an advisory. “Very dangerous avalanche conditions may occur. Travel in and near avalanche terrain is not recommended during HIGH avalanche danger.” This week’s more significant storm follows a smaller system that brought light snow to higher elevations Monday across the region, as well as a light storm that swept through the region last week. Upcoming system remains on track. Any Sierra driving will be treacherous after today. It would be a good idea to delay non-essential travel until conditions improve... If this isn't possible, be sure to carry chains and winter survival supplies in your vehicle. #snow #cawx #nvwx pic.twitter.com/sD5pQ02GKt — NWS Reno (@NWSReno) April 20, 2022 “Now is the time to secure loose outdoor items such as patio furniture, holiday decorations, and trash cans before winds increase which could blow these items away,” according to the Wednesday morning NWS advisory. “The best thing to do is prepare ahead of time by making sure you have extra food and water on hand, flashlights with spare batteries and/or candles in the event of a power outage.” Snow levels are forecast to lower to 6,000 feet after midnight into early Thursday morning. New precipitation between a quarter and half of an inch of rain is possible into Thursday evening. Snow levels will drop from 5,700 to 4,700 feet after midnight into early Friday, according to NWS. New snow accumulation of less than a half inch possible, with little to now snow expected at lower elevations into Friday afternoon.

4/21/2022,"A family got the scare of a lifetime when they got stuck on a roller coaster mid-ride. TikToker Morgan Scott shared footage of the chilling incident on the coaster. Scott, her son, nephew and sister-in-law were on the Tennessee Tornado coaster at Dollywood when the ride stopped in its literal tracks. The foursome was left stranded in their seats at the very height of the incline, which has a 128-foot drop at 70 mph. Auto insurance rates are increasing in 2022 — here’s how to prepare “This is not how I saw my Dollywood trip going,” Scott said. “We are literally stuck on a roller coaster in midair. It’s terrifying. No telling how long we’re going to be here, but it’s a little scary.” Scott explained that at one point, an overhead speaker claimed someone was going to retrieve them. But the “scariest part” was after that, when no one came, and the coaster “started up” again after making a loud bang. Eventually, the passengers safely got off the ride, but they didn’t receive any compensation for the inconvenience. Shop Tinashe’s show-stopping looks from her In The Know cover shoot: “Glad the ride computer stopped you on the lift hill to prevent an accident. This is normal. I’ve worked in theme parks for 10 years,” a user said. Scott replied, “I’m all for the safety, but them telling us they are coming to get us [and] then starting the ride back up was scary!” The video racked up over 3.3 million views on TikTok. Most people agreed that they would have been just as scared. “I would be freaking out. One of my biggest fears,” someone wrote. “Of all rides, the Tennessee Tornado is probably the most terrifying to be stuck on. New fear unlocked,” another said. “I would not be that chill. I’d be crying,” a person commented. Christian Cowan’s first foray into menswear lets everyone be ‘part of that fantasy’: In The Know is now available on Apple News — follow us here!
