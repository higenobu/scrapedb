1/4/2022,"Keir Starmer will launch his plan to maintain the momentum of Labour’s poll lead in the runup to the next election, accusing Boris Johnson of losing voters’ trust due to numerous sleaze scandals and treating power like a “branch of the entertainment industry”. Keen to progress from criticising the government to presenting his own team as a viable alternative, Starmer is expected to flesh out how Labour hopes to spend 2022 climbing closer to power.  In a speech in Birmingham on Tuesday morning, the Labour leader will stress the importance of security, prosperity and respect, contrasted with months of what he called incompetent and untrustworthy behaviour by the prime minister. Johnson has been blighted by fury over alleged Downing Street Christmas parties in defiance of Covid rules, his botched bid to save a disgraced MP who broke lobbying rules from suspension, and an investigation into payments covering the renovation of his Downing Street flat. Labour has spent a month ahead in the polls for the first time in a year, while the Conservatives’ fall has sparked nervousness among Johnson’s ministers and backbenchers. Starmer’s party was also put 16 points ahead in a Deltapoll survey of 57 key “red wall” constituencies in its traditional heartlands, seen as crucial to winning back the keys to Downing Street. Starmer will seek to paint himself as a patriot, saying 2022 will show off “all that the British have to be proud of” in a bid to neutralise Johnson’s rebuttals that the Labour leader should get behind the government when criticising its handling of Covid. “I don’t think you cease to be a patriot because you notice your country has flaws,” Starmer will says. “On the contrary, the reason we in this party want to correct those flaws is precisely because we are patriotic. I came into politics to make things happen, not just to talk about them. “I don’t think politics is a branch of the entertainment industry, I think it’s the serious business of getting things done. Heralding a “new phase” for the country, Starmer is expected to warn of a looming cost of living crisis, with energy bills set to rise, wages stagnant and tax rises on the horizon, with the national insurance rise coming into effect in the spring. He will also claim that many people feel unsafe on the streets and that they have to rely on “good luck” to get a quick GP appointment. Starmer will also acknowledge that a lapse in support for the Conservatives does not mean voters will automatically feel they have good reason to switch to Labour. He is set to say: “I am well aware that just because the Tories lose the public’s trust, it doesn’t mean Labour simply inherits it. Trust has to be earned. I am confident but not complacent about the task ahead.” Ahead of May’s local elections, and what Labour figures think could be the final party conference in September before the next general election, Starmer will stress that “the best still lies ahead for this country – but only if we have the courage to create a new Britain”. Johnson has been bullishly optimistic about the UK’s fortunes despite concern over whether fresh restrictions will be imposed due to the Omicron coronavirus variant. In his new year message, the prime minister insisted the country was in an “incomparably better” position than at the start of 2021.",News/Politics,Keir Starmer to unveil plan to build on Labour’s poll lead momentum,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/03/keir-starmer-to-unveil-plan-to-build-on-labours-poll-lead-momentum
1/4/2022,"Good morning to everyone except those just returning from annual leave, to whom I offer my condolences instead. This is Five Great Reads, a weekday summer story wrap that does what it says on the tin, selected by me, Guardian Australia’s canned food, candles and courtship editor, Alyx Gorman. You might be getting this as an email – but if you’re not, you could be. Just pop your details in the box below.  Usually, at this point I’d be giving you a brief summary of today’s biggest headlines before moving on to the reads. But fortunately – for me at least – my colleagues at the Morning Mail have returned to work, so I’ll gladly leave that task in their expert hands. Spoiler: a lot of not-great stuff happening. But also, some great reads. Let’s talk about them! For decades, directors have selected 2022 as a particularly ill-fated year. What can we learn from old movies, set in the present? Which directors? What movies? Richard “Soylent Green is people” Fleischer, for one. Also the original Purge film, which actually came true a year and two days earlier than expected. Best descriptive phrase: “Admirably dumb eco-spectacle.” Bonus read: What with it feeling so close to home, contemporary apocalypse films are delivering a cinematic experience that’s less spectacular and more intimate. Arnold Latu was found dead in his berth. His is one of more than a dozen cases of fisheries observers dying on the job since 2009. Notable quote: “Latu’s death is still a mystery for us,” said his longtime friend Benny Jagroop. “So if you ask what [is] the speculation around Arnold’s death, for real I have no idea.” How long will it take me to read? About three minutes. It helps! But it’s hard. Here’s a guide to getting started, from core-strengthening classes to moves you can do at home. Notable quote: “Any single treatment in low back pain is never enough by itself,” says Assoc Prof Michael Vagg, a pain medicine physician. “But exercise is a fundamental part of recovering from low back pain and managing it if it becomes persistent.” My back doesn’t hurt. Lucky you! But, if you are one of the millions of Australians living with another form of ongoing pain or illness, keep your eyes peeled. This story is part of a series How to move, and there’s more advice on exercise and chronic conditions coming. The first, which ran yesterday, tackled rheumatoid arthritis. The Go-Betweens’ Lindy Morrison on the gig she’ll never forget: Roskilde, 1987. Setting the scene: “I had bought the cookie from an ingratiating post-punk hippie. My musician mate disappears. I lean against a tent post.”I’m intrigued. How long is the read? Only two minutes or so. Why an imperfect produce box will get you eating fresher for less. But it’s a weird shape!

1/4/2022,"We’re getting to the point, surely, where television drama could be named the sixth estate. In the last year alone, we have had Deceit, probing the police ethics around the Rachel Nickell investigation, Frank Cottrell-Boyce’s Stephen, about the ongoing mishandling of the Stephen Lawrence case, Jimmy McGovern’s look at the prison system’s failures in Time, and Jack Thorne’s Help, telling, almost in real time, the story of care homes abandoned by government policy and the inhabitants left for dead as a result. All brought terrible injustices by those supposedly sworn to uphold the law and protect us – risibly old-fashioned though such phrases feel – to greater public prominence, and hopefully add to the pressure for holding to account those whose dereliction of duty at best, and corruption at worst, does society so much harm. Anne, a drama about the mother who fought through police denials and obstructions for the eventual unlawful killings verdict for the Hillsborough victims, is currently airing. And there are surely more in the works – perhaps on the murders of Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman and the two officers sent to guard the scene, who took photos and shared the images on WhatsApp, or the murder by another officer of Sarah Everard (possibly including the breaking up of a peaceful vigil for her thereafter). The thin blue line refuses to run unerringly straight. And so to Four Lives (BBC One), about the murders of four young men by serial killer and rapist Stephen Port (a fine and chilling performance by Stephen Merchant) and a police investigation so fundamentally flawed that an inquest jury recently found that it probably contributed to three of the four deaths.  The drama does a good job of making the victims – Anthony Walgate, Gabriel Kovari, Daniel Whitworth, Jack Taylor (portrayed with depth, vigour and sweetness by Tim Preston, Jakub Svec, Leo Flanagan and Paddy Rowan, respectively) – live again. It shows them with the families and friends who will come to be the ones who follow leads and pull together most of the evidence necessary for Port’s eventual conviction, giving space to their relationships, and shape to everyone’s loss when it comes. Anthony, a fashion student who occasionally worked as an escort for extra cash, is the first to cross paths with Port. He is found dead outside the man’s flat after Port himself – posing as an anonymous citizen concerned about the apparently drunk young man – calls an ambulance. Beyond that, and despite the usual great work of Sheridan Smith (as Anthony’s mother, Sarah) and others, the drama never catches fire. It is doomed perhaps by the extremity of the police failures. News reports of the inquest jury findings are compelling reads – the list of things the police did not do, chose to ignore or failed to follow up is mind-boggling. Some of the most egregious examples (in a competitive field) make it into Four Lives. The Met’s insistence that there can be no link between the deaths of four young gay men by the same means and in the same locality – two of them found in the same graveyard, one with a suicide note the family says it (contrary to police claims) never identified as being in their son’s handwriting. No testing of the bed sheet he was found on. And, above all, no full interrogation of Stephen Port after a mobile phone trace revealed he was the anonymous caller, who also owned the flat Anthony’s body lay outside and gave a variety of inconsistent statements about how he came across him. Dramatically, it leaves the main characters little more to do than shout down the phone at disinterested officers and boggle at their unwillingness to chase what seems to them and us obvious leads and suspects. There seems to have been no coverup – just a long line of people who didn’t care enough how or why these young men, these sons, these friends, these lovers died. And, presumably, there was an element of deep-seated homophobia (though you also wonder, even if we take only recent headlines as our touchstones, just for whom the police do still bestir themselves and deem worthy of justice), which is of course awful – if not exactly shocking. Very few of the tangible failings are even mentioned in the first episode and we never see any behind-the-scenes work (or lack thereof) by the police. We are limited to the investigating officers’ inability to remember how to pronounce Anthony’s name (with the ‘th’ audible) and assumptions about his lifestyle, based on his occasional escort gigs and poppers found in his flat, to infer their lack of professionalism and humanity. But this kind of drama thrives on detail, not mere gesturings towards motive and should not depend on assumptions that right-minded viewers will draw the right conclusions.",Arts/Television & radio,Four Lives review – truly damning TV about those who are meant to protect and serve,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/03/four-lives-review-stephen-merchant-chilling-stephen-port-troubling-mind-boggling-drama-police-protect-and-serve
1/4/2022,"Ispent a lot of time this past week googling “UTI” and “kidney infection”. Not because I got an enviable amount of action over the festive period but because my ailing 87-year-old dad with advanced Parkinson’s disease received the diagnosis and Mum and I were tasked with the impossible decision of sending him to an understaffed Sydney hospital riven with Covid or try to keep him alive at home ourselves. Dad fell ill at the worst possible time: just as GPs were going on holidays, pathology labs were turning off their lights for a few days, thousands of New South Wales healthcare staff were furloughed with Covid or as close contacts, and as the state’s coronavirus infections jumped 90% in 24 hours to a new daily high of 21,151.  So when, last Thursday afternoon, Dad’s GP took one look at his symptoms and cloudy, blood-speckled urine sample and declared he had a kidney infection, our hearts went into freefall. With no time before the pathology lab shut for the holidays to determine which antibiotic would best treat his infection, his doctor gave him a prescription for something generic and potent, and told my elderly Mum with no medical acumen to “monitor his pee”. “If it still looks bad in 24 hours, call an ambulance and admit him to hospital.” This was not my dad’s first brush with a misbehaving bladder – only four weeks before this he was admitted to a major Sydney hospital with a UTI where he was pumped with IV antibiotics, fluids and subjected to regular blood tests and imaging to ensure the meds were working and the infection hadn’t spread to the danger zone: his kidneys. UTIs often present differently in the elderly compared with younger people, with symptoms including vomiting, falls and major personality changes (see Logan Roy’s deranged response to a UTI in the last season of Succession). These infections can also quickly become deadly. Four weeks ago Dad received good care and was discharged in less than a week. Oh what a difference a few weeks, a new Covid variant and a mask-averse premier can make. The 24 hours after the GP’s ominous instructions were fraught. No one in the family could sleep and, as the last day of 2021 dawned, we monitored Dad’s pee like mad scientists. Friday evening rolled around and, as Sydney was gearing up for New Year’s Eve celebrations, it became apparent Dad’s urine was not improving and neither was he. So we called an ambulance. With visitors now shut out of hospitals and no phones beside patients’ beds, we feared these could be our last moments with Dad. We hastily sourced a simple mobile and tried to teach him how to use it but, having never used a computer before, let alone a touch-screen phone, he struggled to understand. His poor eyesight, his inability to control his fingers, his decimated short-term memory and the delirium from the infection made the task near-impossible, and I tried not to choke up as I repeated: “Just tap on the screen gently, don’t jab it.” The paramedics arrived and tried to put on a cheerful front. One of them was remarkably frank. He took one look at Dad, all shrivelled and gaunt in his wheelchair at the kitchen table, and said: “To be honest, I don’t want to send any geriatric to a Sydney hospital right now. Covid is everywhere – in staff and patients, and the staff shortages mean he won’t get the care he needs.” The paramedic suggested Mum and I try treating him at home, even though most GPs were closed until Tuesday, no one was answering calls on the national home doctor service line, and we had nothing but Google to guide us. He explained that because Dad had a kidney infection, he would initially be placed in the “hot room” of the hospital’s emergency department, where patients with any sort of infection, headache, diarrhoea, cold symptoms and fever were placed. AKA, the Covid room. (The “cold room”, the paramedic explained, was reserved for ailments such as broken limbs and heart attacks.) Mum and I glanced at each other, alarmed. The paramedic offered to call the triage nurse at the hospital’s emergency department to beg her not to place Dad in the room full of potential Covid patients. The nurse was sympathetic but explained it was hospital protocol. Also, given the number of patients in emergency that evening, Dad would be waiting in the hot room “for at least five hours” before he could be moved (provided he tested negative to Covid on arrival – we had performed a negative RAT test on him the day before). Dad sat there in the kitchen, not understanding what was going on, the N95 mask we had placed on him slipping off his nose and down his face. I imagined him sitting in the ED’s “hot room” with the mask half off, confused and tired and unable to sit upright in the chair or access a toilet or water. In that moment, Mum and I agreed to keep him at home. The past few days have been a nightmare. Armed with tap water, oral antibiotics, a thermometer and Google, we have monitored Dad’s every symptom or behavioural change. Sometimes he seems better; the next moment he is worse. We feel guilty that we are not giving him the care he needs, guilty for keeping him out of hospital, but also horrified as we read the news stories about overwhelmed wards and mounting Covid cases. We don’t know yet if we have done the right thing. His GP is back on Tuesday, when the pathology labs reopen. We will know then whether our decision to keep him home has kept him safe or will kill him. I wonder how many other families are in the same position right now; how many other elders, vulnerable people, everyone who thought they were invincible but are not, are making these decisions about whether to put their lives in the hands of NSW hospitals.

1/4/2022,"Tuesday marks the end of an era: BlackBerry will discontinue service on its classic smartphones. So for those still holding on to their QWERTY keyboards, be warned. In a 22 December statement, the company reminded users of the development, which will affect services for all of its devices not running on Android software, including the BlackBerry 10, 7.1 OS and earlier.  “As of this date, devices running these legacy services and software through either carrier or Wi-Fi connections will no longer reliably function, including for data, phone calls, SMS and 9-1-1 functionality,” the statement says. Boasting a physical keyboard and BBM instant messaging, the BlackBerry was once a powerplayer in the cell phone world. In the first decade of the 2000s, the devices were toted with pride by white-collar professionals and then-President Barack Obama alike. At its peak in 2009 and 2010, BlackBerry owned nearly 20% of the global smartphone market – with an even higher percentage in the US – selling more than 50m smartphones a year. But with the rise of the iPhone and Android touchscreen devices, the phone eventually fell out of style. And unless it warrants a reboot like the T-Mobile Sidekick or Motorola Razr, it seems that BlackBerry’s moment in the sun has passed. When the iPhone first launched in June 2007, it didn’t immediately overtake BlackBerry’s reign. With an elite status and user-friendly reputation, businesspeople especially, stayed loyal to the product. BlackBerry’s BBM instant messaging system also remained a user favorite feature, boasting the same cachet and ease of iMessage today. Soon, though, BlackBerry’s technology fell behind and users began to make the move away from physical keyboards. BlackBerry launched a series of poorly received devices as the iPhone leveled up and Androids became viable alternatives. After the release of the iPhone 4, Apple’s phone sales passed BlackBerry’s for good. By the time BlackBerry’s technology began to catch up, it was out of fashion. Working professionals, one of BlackBerry’s core customer bases, began to make the switch to iPhones and Androids. In September 2012, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer snubbed the devices by asking that employees transition “from BlackBerries to smartphones”. By 2016, BlackBerry announced it would outsource its product and no longer manufacture its own phones. Instead, the company made a move to pivot into software, similar to Nokia, another former cellular giant. Today, BlackBerry bills itself primarily as “an enterprise software and cybersecurity company” developing software solutions for corporations. The company still employs thousands of workers and pulled in about a billion dollars in revenue in 2020, according to Statista.",News/Technology,BlackBerry signals end of an era as it prepares to pull plug on classic phones,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/03/blackberry-discontinue-service-classic
