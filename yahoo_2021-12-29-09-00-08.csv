12/29/2021,"The scheduled parole for one of the two men convicted of killing Michael Jordan’s father in 1993 was canceled on Tuesday, according to The Associated Press. A North Carolina state panel officially canceled the planned parole for Larry Demery on Tuesday, and did not give a reason why. Demery was approved in August 2020 for the Mutual Agreement Parole Program, which is a vocational and scholastic program offered through the prison, and was scheduled to be released on Aug. 6, 2023. That was then delayed by 12 months to 2024. Convicts in North Carolina who are serving life sentences for murder are no longer eligible for parole in the state. James Jordan’s murder took place in 1993, about one year before that ruling went into effect. Though it’s not clear why the 46-year-old’s parole was canceled, North Carolina Department of Public Safety spokesperson Greg Thomas told The Associated Press that the parole program Demery was part of can be terminated if the prisoner either doesn’t follow program guidelines or violates behavior rules in prison. Per the report, Demery has had 19 infractions since 2001 at the Lincoln County, North Carolina, prison he is at — including two for “substance possession” this month. James was killed on July 23, 1993, when he was sleeping in his car in rural North Carolina. His body was found 11 days later, shortly after Michael won his third NBA title with the Chicago Bulls, in a South Carolina swamp.  Demery, along with former classmate Daniel Green, was sentenced in 1996 for killing James. Demery testified in court that he helped Green move James’ body to that swamp after he said he saw Green shoot James during a random robbery. Demery and Green were 18 at the time. Green, who has long said he’s innocent, was sentenced to life in prison plus 10 years. Demery was sentenced to life in prison plus 40 years after he pleaded guilty to first-degree murder, armed robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery. He was resentenced in 2008 after an error was found in his sentencing, which is partly why he was deemed eligible for parole.",U.S./Yahoo Sports,Scheduled parole for man convicted of killing Michael Jordan's father suddenly canceled,https://news.yahoo.com/scheduled-parole-for-man-convicted-of-killing-michael-jordan-father-suddenly-canceled-chicago-bulls-224557874.html
12/29/2021,"A Chinese model at the center of an ongoing controversy about beauty standards and Western stereotypes in China has clapped back at critics taking a jab at her “slanted eyes.”

Driving the news: The model, who goes by the professional name Cai Niang Niang, appeared in a 2019 ad for a local snack brand called Three Squirrels. Photos from that campaign recently resurfaced on Chinese social media, drawing criticism for its supposed negative portrayal of Chinese women.
 The photos show Cai holding products from the company. One of them contained portraits of Mao Zedong printed on a bowl and a cup. Critics reportedly argued that the photos were feeding into Western stereotypes about Chinese people, which, in this case, is having “slanted eyes.” Some also alleged that Three Squirrels violated advertising laws for using Mao’s images. Some specifically criticized the company for making Cai’s eyes “more slanted” with makeup. Others allegedly called Cai “ugly” and even asked her to stop modeling altogether. Despite the backlash, some encouraged tolerance in accepting diversity in appearances. “Beauty is diverse, and it may be limited and rigid if people restricted it to any particular form,” makeup blogger Wang Yifan told the state-run Global Times. Dior sparked outrage in China for a similar controversy in November. The photographer responsible for the company’s ad is also Chinese, but critics argued that it was also trying to appeal to the “Western aesthetic.” 


What the brand is saying: Three Squirrels has denied accusations that the ad intended to “smear” Chinese women. The company also stressed that Cai’s makeup was done according to her facial features, without any intention to make her look “ugly.”
 Despite its explanation, Three Squirrels was forced to apologize. “Regarding the opinion that the model does not fit the mainstream’s aesthetic taste and makes the public feel uncomfortable, we are sincerely sorry,” the company said, according to the South China Morning Post. Three Squirrels also vowed to remove web pages containing the controversial photos. However, the company did not address the allegations surrounding their use of Mao’s portraits. 


What she’s saying: Cai, who likely had no control in the making of the ad, was forced to respond to the online backlash on Sunday, claiming that it has become a case of “cyberbullying.” She questioned her critics and their authority to decide whether or not she can be Chinese.
 “Am I disqualified to be Chinese just because I have small eyes?” Cai wrote on Weibo, according to SupChina. “I was born with these eyes and they look even smaller in real life. Does that mean I can’t be a model? Have I been offensive to Chinese people since the day I was born?” Cai went on to call for an inclusive beauty standard that would welcome diversity and each person’s “unique charm.” She also pointed out that while she “totally” agrees with patriotism, “creating big problems out of normal matters has become a morbid obsession.”  Featured Images via Three Squirrels Enjoy this content?

12/29/2021,"After appearing on “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” conservative radio talk show host Jesse Kelly is now under fire for controversial comments deemed by critics as racist, sexist and homophobic.

How it started: Carlson took a swing at Adm. Christopher Grady, who was appointed vice-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Dec. 17. Carlson addressed Grady’s claim that he would “value working with the military’s gender advisors if confirmed,” according to Rolling Stone.
 

 “This guy claims to be an admiral,” the television host said of the newly appointed officer. “The question really is: Will the gender advisors [who] Christopher Grady is in favor of make our military better?” Carlson then turned to his guest, Kelly, and asked him if more gender advisers would help the U.S. military compete with its Chinese counterpart. “Oh, there’s no question, Tucker,"" Kelly replied. He then pointed out that China and Russia have developed hypersonic missiles that can “turn New York City to ash,” while Russia has satellites “that can push our satellites out of orbit and cripple our military.” “Our military, though, they’re focused on the important things,” Kelly continued. “We want to focus on climate change, and we definitely have to make sure there are enough tampons in the restrooms at the Pentagon.” “That’s kind of what they’re saying,” Carlson replied. “There’s a psychological term for this…t where there’s a massive real threat that you can’t deal with, so you scurry off and deal with imaginary threats to make yourself feel in control. That kind of feels like what we’re watching.” Kelly then said they are watching the “destruction of the U.S. military” and the death of “maybe hundreds of thousands of Americans.” 
What happened next: The host of “The Jesse Kelly Show” then shared several thoughts which targeted Asians, the LGBTQ plus community and women serving in the military.
 “We don’t need a military that’s woman-friendly, that’s gay-friendly, with all due respect to the Air Force,” he said. Kelly declared that he wants the military to be filled with “Type A men” who “want to sit on a throne of Chinese skulls.” “But we don’t have that now,” he continued. “We can’t get women off of naval vessels, that should be step one, but most are already pregnant anyway.” Although the number of women joining the U.S. military has grown throughout the years, a Government Accountability Office (GAO) study released last year discovered that “women are significantly more likely to leave the military earlier than their male counterparts,” according to Stars and Stripes. Some of the problems listed include sexism, sexual assault, and how the military approaches investigations of sexual assault. “For example, two females stated that the perpetrator was not punished, and another woman cited the lack of support from other service members as contributing to their decisions to separate from the military,” the GAO authors wrote. In a tweet posted last week, Kelly remained unapologetic for his comments, saying: “I’m the furthest thing in the world from being ‘anti-Asian.’ I’ve been a supporter of Lucy Liu for quite some time.”   I’m the furthest thing in the world from being “anti-Asian”. I’ve been a supporter of Lucy Liu for quite some time. https://t.co/71VvQUXKDY  — Jesse Kelly (@JesseKellyDC) December 23, 2021    Public reaction: Many social media users took to Twitter to call out Kelly for his comments.

12/29/2021,"A Mariposa-area child was left without his father, his last surviving parent after a post-Christmas outing to the snow ended in a fatal car accident. On Sunday, Andrew Trujillo, his girlfriend, and their respective children were on a holiday outing to see snow around the Yosemite area when a tragic accident cut his life short. Trujillo was driving the bunch outside of Yosemite National Park when he appeared to have lost control of the vehicle driving south on Highway 41. The car veered off the road and into a tree, where Trujillo suffered fatal injuries, according to California Highway Patrol Officer Jason Bettini. Family members said he was avoiding another car, which sent him off the road. Trujillo, 27, a widowed father, left behind a 2-year-old son named Drew. The toddler’s tragic loss of his father comes a little over a year after losing his mother, Stacy Tara Trujillo. Now the grieving family is looking for financial support for the child. “Baby Drew is now an orphan,” said Charles “Chuck” Stone, an uncle to Trujillo, in a Tuesday morning interview with The Bee. “We don’t even know what the future holds for him,” said Stone. “We’re all concerned about him because he’s got so much tragedy.” Relatives described Andrew Trujillo as a caring, tenderhearted person who was well-loved by all. “Andrew was a very special guy,” said John Trujillo, uncle of the deceased father, who said that Trujillo would drop what he was doing to help anyone in need of assistance. “He’s a good soul,” said John Trujillo. “He was a tremendous young man.” Trujillo also had his share of tragedy, according to his uncle, Stone. A car accident that left him with a “severely” broken leg robbed him of his dream career as a fireman. Instead, Trujillo pursued a career as a paramedic with Sierra and Mercy Ambulance companies. Then, Trujillo suffered the loss of his wife, who took her own life last September after battling postpartum depression, among other things, family members said. She was pregnant with a baby girl at the time. After the tragic loss of his wife, Trujillo was “just starting over” with his son, Drew, as well as a new girlfriend and her two children, said Stone. Trujillo’s girlfriend and her children were also in the car at the time of the accident. CHP confirmed that three children between the ages 2 to 11 were transported to Valley Children’s Hospital with “minor to major injuries.” Trujillo’s relatives said she and her children remained in the hospital Tuesday. Drew, who was in a car seat, was spared from major injuries. Drew’s paternal grandparents, Victoria and Kenneth Trujillo plan to raise the 2-year-old. “He’s got plenty of people that love him and care about him,” said John Trujillo, adding that the child has lots of cousins and family that “adore him.” “But we can ever replace mom and dad,” said the late father’s uncle. Family members said that little Drew has been asking for his dad over the past few days. When they tell him that his dad is in heaven, “he gets really upset,” said John Trujillo. For now, the grieving family is focused on supporting little Drew, as well as planning for his future. Stone’s wife, Susannah, organized a GoFundMe to raise funds for Drew’s future expenses. “We just want him to have some sort of future, which is never going to be completely normal,” said Stone. “But we’re just hoping for him to just continue on being a happy little feller.” In less than 24 hours, the GoFundMe had raised over $18,000 of the $100,000 goal as of Tuesday afternoon.",U.S./Fresno Bee,California toddler is orphaned after parents die in separate tragedies.

12/29/2021,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has ordered a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier strike group to stay in the Mediterranean Sea region rather than move on to the Middle East, amid worries about the buildup of thousands of Russian troops near the Ukraine border. A defense official said Tuesday that the change in the schedule of the USS Harry S. Truman, and the five American warships accompanying it, reflects the need for a persistent presence in Europe. It is necessary in order to reassure U.S. allies and partners in the region, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military deployment details. The U.S. and Western allies have watched as the buildup of Russian troops near the border grew to a peak of an estimated 100,000, fueling fears that Moscow was preparing to invade Ukraine. Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and shortly after threw its support behind a separatist rebellion in the country’s east. Over more than seven years, the fighting has killed over 14,000 people and devastated Ukraine’s industrial heartland, known as the Donbas. Russia has denied any intention of launching a new invasion and instead has accused Ukraine of hatching plans to try to use force to reclaim control of the territories held by Moscow-backed rebels. Ukraine has rejected that claim. The Truman strike group includes five U.S. ships —- the cruiser USS San Jacinto and the guided missile destroyers USS Cole, USS Bainbridge, USS Gravely and USS Jason Dunham. Also with them is the Royal Norwegian Navy frigate HNoMS Fridtjof Nansen. The Truman left its homeport of Norfolk, Virginia, on Dec. 1, and entered the Mediterranean Sea on Dec. 14.

12/29/2021,"The mayor of Boynton Beach, Florida, is speaking out about the death of a 13-year old boy on a dirt bike in an attempted traffic stop on Sunday. Police said the boy was driving the dirt bike recklessly when he ""went down"" on North Federal Highway. Video obtained by CBS affiliate WPEC shows the boy, Stanley Davis Jr., pulling up at a nearby Chevron gas station shortly before the incident. He goes inside to pay, wearing his helmet. Then he rides away and a police vehicle follows him down the street. Davis rides out of frame, then circles back, turning north, with the police vehicle close behind. About three blocks later, Davis was dead. According to the Florida Highway Patrol incident report, Davis was riding northbound on U.S. Highway 1 when he lost control of his dirt bike and hit the curb of the median. The impact sent him into a one-way sign in the median before landing in the road. The Boynton Beach Police Department said the police vehicle involved was not equipped with a dashcam.  ""At this point in the preliminary investigation, I have not seen any evidence or heard any witness testimony that states the officer's vehicle came in contact with the dirt bike,"" Police Chief Michael G. Gregory said at a briefing Sunday. Davis' heartbroken father, Stanley Davis Sr., described his son in an interview with the station as ""a great football player, great big brother, loving son. All-around perfect kid, never had any issues with him."" Mayor Steven B. Grant went to the scene on Sunday and spoke with community members who were both sad and angry about the boy's death. ""My statement to them was we should not blame the police department for the actions of an individual officer; however, the city and police are responsible,"" Grant said Monday in an interview with WPEC. Davis was Black, and given the city's history, the mayor said he understands why some believe race played a role in this tragedy. ""The situation that created this didn't happen just yesterday, this is an aspect of how the city has treated parts of the city for decades, even before I was mayor. So the city is trying to work with the community to get a resolution so that it's safer for everyone,"" Grant said. The police officer is on paid leave while the Florida Highway Patrol conducts its investigation. The department's pursuit policy states that an officer can only chase a suspect if they believe the person committed a forcible felony. Whether the officer violated department policy in this incident is still under investigation, WPEC reported.

12/29/2021,"TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — New Jersey's Supreme Court on Tuesday threw out the 2016 conviction of a Florida woman for killing her 5-year-old son 25 years earlier, ruling that despite the jury’s verdict, prosecutors failed to present enough evidence to prove she had purposely caused the boy’s death. It was a stunning turnaround in one of New Jersey's most infamous cold cases, which had remained unresolved for years even though Michelle Lodzinski was considered a prime suspect from the outset after she gave varying accounts of what happened on the day Timothy Wiltsey was last seen. It also means Lodzinski cannot be tried again, which would violate a prohibition on so-called “double jeopardy” or being tried twice for the same matter, her attorney Gerald Krovatin said. “This is a great day for the rule of law and for the proposition that convictions have to be based on evidence, not on speculation or emotion,” he said. “Michelle is enormously grateful to everyone who has stood by her throughout this long ordeal.” Appellate Judge Jose Fuentes — called up to the Supreme Court to serve as a tiebreaking vote after the justices split 3-3 while upholding Lodzinski’s conviction in May — cast the deciding vote in favor of acquittal Tuesday. “After reviewing the entirety of the evidence and after giving the state the benefit of all its favorable testimony and all the favorable inferences drawn from that testimony, no reasonable jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Lodzinski purposefully or knowingly caused Timothy’s death,” the court wrote in its majority decision. The prosecutor's office that tried her declined comment. Lodzinski was a single mother in central New Jersey in May 1991 when she told investigators Wiltsey had disappeared while they were at a carnival in Sayreville. She later gave conflicting accounts describing strangers she had seen who could have kidnapped the boy. Wiltsey’s body was found nearly a year later, in a marshy area near an office complex where Lodzinski had once worked. As time passed and no charges were filed, Lodzinski went on with her life and had two other children. She was living in Port St. Lucie, Florida, in 2014 when authorities in New Jersey charged her with killing Wiltsey. Investigators said a break in the case had come when Wiltsey’s former babysitters identified a blue blanket, found along with the boy’s body, as belonging to Lodzinski. During her 2016 trial and on appeal, Lodzinski’s lawyers argued that no forensic evidence tied her to the blanket and that prosecutors didn’t produce enough evidence to show Lodzinski purposely caused the boy’s death. A cause of death couldn’t be determined because Wiltsey’s body had deteriorated in the time between when he died and when the body was found. “If you can’t find a cause of death, I submit you don’t have a homicide by definition,” Krovatin told the court during arguments in October. Prosecutors, who had portrayed Lodzinski at trial as a struggling young mother who felt burdened by the boy, argued on appeal that the totality of the evidence, including her evasive answers during initial questioning, was enough to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. An appeals court agreed in 2019 when it upheld Lodzinski’s conviction. The plot thickened after a deeply split state Supreme Court ruling in May upheld the appeals court’s decision. With Chief Justice Stuart Rabner not participating, the court split 3-3, but it was enough to leave the conviction undisturbed. Writing at that time for the three dissenters, Justice Barry Albin wrote, “In the modern annals of New Jersey legal history, to my knowledge, no murder conviction has ever been upheld on such a dearth of evidence.” In a dissenting opinion as part of Tuesday's ruling, the three justices that voted to convict said, “In our view, the majority does the opposite of what our law requires.” In October, the state Supreme Court took the rare step of agreeing to rehear the case, conceding it had made a procedural mistake by ruling on an appellate court decision that had applied an incorrect legal standard. For the rehearing, the court added an appellate judge to serve as a tiebreaking vote. “Even if the evidence suggested that Timothy did not die by accident, no testimony or evidence was offered to distinguish whether Timothy died by the negligent, reckless, or purposeful or knowing acts of a person, even if that person were Lodzinski,” the majority decision read. ___ AP writer David Porter in Newark contributed to this report.",U.S./Associated Press,Woman's conviction in '91 killing of 5-year-old son tossed,https://news.yahoo.com/womans-conviction-91-killing-5-152407131.html
