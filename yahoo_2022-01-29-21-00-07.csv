1/29/2022,"Fox News’ Julie Banderas recalled misogynistic comments that were once made to her by a former male colleague. “He told me that he would only marry someone who was hot because he wants to have hot kids,” Banderas remembered on Friday’s episode of “Outnumbered.” “He wouldn’t marry a fat girl, I’m not kidding, this actually came out of the mouth of a man to me, because he wouldn’t want to have fat children,” she continued. “I’m not even joking. And the criteria was that they must be hot. There are a lot of idiots out there.” Banderas did not name the former colleague “because then he would be ruined forever,” she said in a video shared by The Daily Beast. Banderas, a mother of three, has worked at Fox News since 2005. It’s unclear if she worked for the conservative network when the comments were made by her then-coworker. The recollection came during a panel discussion condemning the similarly misogynistic comments made by Anthony Casasanta, a host on “The No Filter Podcast.” Casasanta, in a video that went viral on TikTok with more than 2.2 million views and sparked outrage worldwide, said: “If my wife lets herself go after I have kids with her, I’m going to tell her, once: ‘If you don’t get your shit together...’ I still want to be sexually attracted to my wife, my spouse, girlfriend too. ‘But if you can’t do that, I’m out.’” The podcast hosts refused to apologize, however, and claimed in a statement to news.com.au that their comments had been taken “out of context.” This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.",U.S./HuffPost,Fox News Host Recalls Ex-Colleague’s Offensive ‘Wouldn’t Marry A Fat Girl' Comments,https://news.yahoo.com/fox-news-host-recalls-ex-104824106.html
1/29/2022,"Bill Maher saved his best for last on his Friday night Real Time on HBO. After bland discussions on civil liberties, Covid-19 rules, affirmative action, and whether actual partisan combat may be brewing, he turned his guns on an unexpected target – the leftist progressives whose crazy demands have turned real life into comedy gold. Maher noted a recent statement by a Fox News commentator, who suggested he’s gearing up to run for president, which critics saw as a sign that he’s changed. “I am not,” he insisted. “I am still the same unmarried, pot-smoking libertine I always was.” The recently turned 66-year-old added, “I have many flaws, but you can’t accuse me of maturing.” More from Deadline HBO Sets 'Everyone In My Family Has Killed Someone' Limited Series Adaptation With Bruna Papandrea As EP Sundance Review: Daniel Roher Documentary Thriller 'Navalny' 'Euphoria' Hits Another Ratings Series High, 'The Gilded Age' Draws HBO's Biggest Monday Premiere Audience Since 'Chernobyl' “Let’s get this straight,” Maher said. “It’s not me who’s changed, it’s the left. A large contingent has gone mental, and I’m willing to call them out.” That willingness to keep it real, Maher said, shouldn’t make him a hero to Republicans, “where simply acknowledging reality is seen as a profile in courage.” While critics say the old Maher didn’t make fun of the left as much, he countered, “Yeah, because they didn’t give me so much to work with. The oath of office I took was to comedy.” Maher contended that it was not his fault that the party of FDR and JFK has now turned to LOL and WTF moments, where congresspeople talk of canceling rent and mortgages, canceling Lincoln and Dr. Seuss, and making Mr. Potato Head gender neutral, among other sins. “You have to inject yourself into everything,” Maher lamented of hyper-liberal woke. “This is why so many were triggered by Covid policies. They were already sick of rules.” He claimed that the average voter would agree that banks and chemical plants and drug companies need watching. “But Democrats are becoming a parody of self, making rules to make rules…making sure everything bad never happens again.” That you can never really do, he said. “It just makes everything a drag.” “Democrats no longer possess the common sense to know that not every problem can be fixed with a regulation,” he said. “Democrats have to stop thinking that what voters dream about is to be hassled.” Watch the video above. Earlier, guest Ira Glasser, former executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, talked about how that organization seems to have lost its way. He was followed by former senior director at the U.S. National Security Council and author of There Is Nothing for You Here: Finding Opportunity in the 20th Century Fiona Hill, and host of The Reason Roundtable podcast and co-host of The Fifth Column podcast Matt Welch. All seemed in agreement that the pandemic regulations have worn out their welcome, and that NATO should have been revamped when the Soviet Union fell.
