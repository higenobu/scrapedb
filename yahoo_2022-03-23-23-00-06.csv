He said ""nobody who was predicting what sanctions the West would pass could have pictured that."" Russia's foreign minister called the freezing of Russia's currency reserves in light of its invasion of Ukraine ""thievery"" and said the country did not expect that level of sanctions. Sergei Lavrov spoke to students in Moscow on Wednesday. According to The New York Times, he said about the West's freezing of Russia's central bank reserves that ""nobody who was predicting what sanctions the West would pass could have pictured that. It's just thievery."" The US and European countries were among those who froze Russian reserves. Russia has around $640 billion in foreign reserves. Russia's finance minister Anton Siluanov said earlier this month that around $300 billion — half of Russia's reserves — had been frozen. Other sanctions on Russia include the blocking the trade of luxury goods and heavy sanctions on Russian oligarchs. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov described the sanctions on oligarchs as ""state banditry"" earlier this month.

3/23/2022,"Ukraine's prosecutor-general said on Tuesday that a Russian soldier raped a Ukrainian civilian. The soldier broke into a civilian home, shot its owner, and raped his wife, Iryna Venediktova said. Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of using rape as an instrument of war. Ukraine's prosecutor-general accused Russian soldiers of killing a civilian and raping his wife after breaking into their home near Kyiv. Iryna Venediktova said in a Facebook post on Tuesday that the attack took place in Brovary, an eastern suburb of the capital. There, a Russian soldier ""broke into a private house and shot the owner,"" she wrote, describing the victim as a civilian. Venediktova said the soldier was drunken, and that he and another Russian soldier then issued threats of violence and then raped the man's wife several times. Their young child was nearby, she said. Insider was unable to verify the claims. Venediktova did not give names of anybody involved or cite evidence. It is unclear when the alleged attack took place. Russian ground forces tried to take over Brovary in an assault starting March 11, as The New York Times reported. Footage released by the Ukraine Defense Intelligence Agency on March 11 showed Ukrainian missiles causing chaos amongst a column of advancing Russian tanks at Skybyn, a village nearby. Ukrainian officials have previously accused Russian forces of raping Ukrainians as part of the invasion. On March 4, addressing a London-based think tank, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said ""we have numerous cases of, unfortunately, when Russian soldiers rape women in Ukrainian cities,"" Reuters reported. Reuters said it was unable to verify that claim. The incident described by Venediktova on Tuesday is the first to be subject to an official investigation. This came after the woman, who survived, registered a complaint, according to Ukrainian MP Inna Sovsun. A request for the soldier's detention had been filed in court, Venediktova said. Kyiv prosecutors received the information as part of intelligence on Russian movements in occupied areas, Venediktova said. Another MP, Lesia Vasylenko, accused Russia of using rape as an instrument of war. She drew a comparison to the mass rapes that followed the Soviet Red Army's 1945 victories in Germany, where historians say two million German women were raped.

3/23/2022,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on Wednesday that after delays in deliveries, further supplies of Strela missiles, which had been in the inventories of the former Communist East German army, were on the way to Ukraine. Russia's invasion of Ukraine prompted Germany to stage a historic reversal of its policy of not sending weapons to conflict zones, but the Ukrainian government has been frustrated by delays. ""I can clearly say that further Strela deliveries are on the way,"" Baerbock told the Bundestag lower house of parliament. ""We are one of the biggest weapons suppliers in this situation, it doesn't make us proud but it's what we must do to help Ukraine,"" she added. She also said that a first flight carrying Ukrainian refugees from Moldova to Germany would take place on Friday or Saturday.
