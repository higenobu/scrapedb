2/28/2022,"Ukrainians who are family members of British nationals and who want to evacuate from their home country are better placed than others trying to flee war thanks to a decision by the Home Office to relax the visa rules for this group. However, new Home Office guidance, which was updated on Sunday states these concessions are only temporary. Free for family members of British nationals who usually live in Ukraine. The definition of a family member includes a spouse or civil partner or an unmarried partner with whom the applicant has been cohabiting in a relationship for at least two years. The application process has been made more challenging because the UK visa application centre (VAC) in Kyiv is closed and all British visa services there are suspended. Family members can apply through a new, temporary location in the city of Lviv to give their biometrics, or at VACs in Poland, Romania, Hungary or Moldova. The Home Office has agreed some temporary concessions to support Ukrainian nationals currently in the UK who are unable to return when their existing visa expires. These concessions will help Ukrainian nationals in extending their stay in the UK without having to leave and reapply for a new visa from overseas. The Home Office has also introduced a temporary concession to allow Ukrainian nationals already in the UK on a visitor visa to switch into a points-based route or a family visa route. Costs £95 for up to six months. Reasons for applying for this visa include tourism, volunteering and visiting family and friends. Fleeing war is not on the list but currently this visa is the main alternative available to people who are not eligible for the family migration visa. These visas may take several weeks to process and a condition of the visa is that applicants have to give the Home Office undertakings that they plan to return home after a maximum of six months. The unpredictable nature of the war in their home country makes such this difficult. Calls are mounting from parliamentarians and NGOs to introduce humanitarian visas that would enable people fleeing the war in Ukraine to travel to the UK and claim asylum on arrival. At the moment no such visas are available.

2/28/2022,"It was with some surprise that I read the reunification of parts of one of the greatest works of classic antiquity described as a herald of “cultural cleansing” in a letter (16 February) on the question of the return of the Parthenon sculptures. The removal of 75 metres of the Parthenon’s frieze, 15 metopes and 17 pedimental figures from Athens represents at best an abuse of power by Lord Elgin, and at worst an act of vandalism and spoliation that far exceeded the bounds of the dubious permission granted to him to “take away some pieces of stone” which were “preserved in rubble” around the Parthenon. Setting legal questions aside, the Parthenon stands as one of the wonders of ancient antiquity. Crafted by Phidias, commissioned by Pericles, it stood as a celebration of the city of Athens, its democracy, and its goddess Athena. It is one integral work of art, reunifying the remaining parts of which would be an act of extraordinary reverence for and appreciation of our shared human heritage.Alf DubsLabour, House of Lords  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Cambridge Pre-U is regulated by Ofqual, and the standards for it and A-level are aligned, as reflected in the Ucas points available for each Pre-U grade. Universities are used to making fair comparisons between different qualifications, whether between A-level and Cambridge Pre-U, or between equivalent qualifications from around the world with different grade scales.

2/28/2022,"Confidential documents have revealed how the telecoms giant Ericsson is alleged to have helped pay bribes to the Islamic State terrorist group in order to continue selling its services after the militants seized control of large parts of Iraq. The leak of internal investigations at Ericsson, which also found that the firm had put its contractors at risk and allowed them to be kidnapped by the militants, is potentially damaging for the multinational. In addition to the findings about the alleged payments to IS, the investigations uncovered allegations the company was involved in corruption in at least 10 countries across four continents. That would suggest a pattern of wrongdoing by Ericsson that is far wider than what the telecoms giant publicly admitted to in 2019, when it entered into a $1bn (£750m) settlement with the US Department of Justice (DoJ). Ericsson, which is headquartered in Stockholm, employs 100,000 people and sells telecoms equipment in 180 countries. It plays a leading role in developing the next generation of 5G mobile phone technology in the UK. Two weeks ago, Ericsson’s stock price plunged by 14% when, alerted to the fact media organisations had been leaked the internal reports, it released a public statement admitting to “serious breaches of compliance rules” in Iraq between 2011 and 2019. Since then the telecoms firm has been bracing for the full disclosure of the reports, which were leaked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) which then shared them with media partners including the BBC, the Washington Post and the Guardian. The leaked documents, running to 101 pages, were produced in 2019 and 2020. They record the results of internal investigations commissioned by Ericsson into alleged corruption by the company around the world. Investigators concluded that the multinational firm was likely to have been involved in channelling bribes to IS to allow its products to be transported across parts of Iraq that were held by the terrorists. The payments were made through a slush fund run by contractors working for the Swedish multinational, according to the investigators. After questions from journalists about the leaked documents earlier this month, Ericsson appears to have sought to get ahead of a public relations crisis by publishing the statement on its website partially admitting to the investigators’ findings. In the statement, Ericsson said the investigating team had “identified payments to intermediaries and the use of alternate transport routes in connection with circumventing Iraqi customs, at a time when terrorist organisations, including Islamic State, controlled some transport routes. “Investigators could not determine the ultimate recipients of these payments. Payment schemes and cash transactions that potentially created the risk of money laundering were also identified.” The statement also conceded Ericsson employees had engaged in widespread misconduct in Iraq and committed “serious” violations of its regulations, including irregular payments and non-payment of tax, between 2011 and 2019. Ericsson said it had published the statement because it was “committed to transparency”. Nevertheless, the telecoms giant declined to answer multiple questions from the Guardian, ICIJ and other media, including about potential wrongdoing in several countries that were not mentioned in its 2019 settlement with the DoJ. Ericsson pleaded guilty to paying tens of millions of dollars in corrupt payments through slush funds between 2000 and 2016 in the settlement. The admissions related to just five countries: Djibouti, China, Vietnam, Indonesia and Kuwait. But the leaked documents list evidence of alleged corruption and wrongdoing in a further 10 countries over the past decade. They chronicle suspicious payments totalling at least $37m in Iraq, along with a range of alleged misconduct such as inflated invoices and paying officials to go on holidays to Spain and Sweden. In Lebanon, the company allegedly used a slush fund to give gifts, entertainment and hospitality to members of the government between 2010 and 2019. The total size of the slush fund appears to have been as large as $800,000. Bribes were also allegedly paid in Bahrain and Angola. Ericsson was accused in the documents of being involved in corruption during the award of a contract in South Africa, and acting fraudulently during the acquisition of a company in the US. Other alleged misconduct was identified by the investigators in Brazil, Azerbaijan, Libya and Morocco. Ericsson and the DoJ declined to comment when asked if evidence of potential wrongdoing in the further 10 countries had been disclosed to US prosecutors before they agreed the terms of the 2019 settlement. The DoJ has the right to launch a new prosecution if it believes that Ericsson had not disclosed all allegations of wrongdoing. After taking charge of Mosul in 2014, IS controlled about 40% of Iraq, financing the administration of the territory through a mixture of taxes, the sale of oil and looting until it was driven out in 2017. According to the investigators, Ericsson, which has operated in Iraq for years and sold $1.9bn worth of equipment between 2011 and 2018, received offers from firms that were prepared to transport their infrastructure through Iraq. The multinational chose a contractor that cost more money than other firms, but promised guaranteed, quicker deliveries. This premium-priced option became known as “speed way service” in contrast to “the legal way”, the documents record. According to the investigators, “the higher cost has likely been used for bribery and payments to local [militants] along transportation routes”. Improper payments were also made to customs officials to circumvent border taxes. The investigators found 18 invoices that had been paid by Ericsson to one of the suppliers to transport equipment, such as mobile phone masts, on trucks through Iraq. The payments were three times higher than the normal cost of hiring these trucks, and for one consignment, it was 20 times the usual cost. After plotting the routes on a map of Iraq, and noting that the infrastructure was delivered to areas held by IS and other militias, investigators concluded Ericsson may have engaged in “bribery or illegitimate payments” to carry out its transportation operations. “Although there is no firm interview confirmation of bribery, facilitation payment or potential illicit financing of terrorism, there is evidence of emails indicating illegal bypassing of customs and passing through IS-controlled areas in connection to transportation in Iraq,” the report said. The investigators, who questioned Ericsson employees and associates, added: “There were numerous interviews stating it was more important to do business and deliver to customers, than ensuring the transportations were conducted according to laws and regulations.” They said there was no evidence that Ericsson employees were directly involved in any payments to IS. The total size of what the investigators call “an uncontrolled slush fund” between 2016 and 2018 that was likely to have been used to fund the transportation routes is not identified in the documents. But they point out that one individual was able to embezzle $308,000 from this fund. In its statement, Ericsson said that as a result of the investigation, several employees left the company and “multiple other disciplinary and other remedial actions were taken”. It added that it stopped working with a number of firms and ensured that its employees in Iraq underwent enhanced training. The leaked documents also show how Ericsson jeopardised their contractors in Iraq in the pursuit of profits, as managers strove to continue the firm’s commercial operations even after IS took control of Mosul. According to investigators, emails showed “this persistence resulted in the kidnapping of [contractors] while doing fieldwork for Ericsson”. The investigators added that even after the kidnapping, Ericsson sought to carry on doing business in the area. One of the contractors who was kidnapped told Amir Musawy, a reporter working for the Germany TV station NDR, that he had felt pressure from Ericsson and his firm to continue working. “There were pressures on us,” he said. “Either you continue to work or the contract would be withdrawn. Ericsson put pressure on my company and my company put pressure on us as teams.” The engineer, who cannot be identified for his own safety, said he was kept under house arrest by IS for a month, during which time Ericsson staff turned off their phones and did not answer his calls for help. He was eventually let go.",News/Business,Revealed: leaked files show how Ericsson allegedly helped bribe Islamic State,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/27/revealed-leaked-files-ericsson-allegedly-helped-bribe-islamic-state
2/28/2022,"The Republican senator Tom Cotton refused four times on Sunday to condemn or even comment on Donald Trump’s repeated praise for Vladimir Putin, the Russian president who ordered the invasion of Ukraine. “If you want to know what Donald Trump thinks about Vladimir Putin or any other topic,” Cotton told ABC’s This Week, “I’d encourage you to invite him on your show. I don’t speak on behalf of other politicians. They can speak for themselves.” The former president’s views are clear. Trump has repeatedly praised Putin and though at CPAC on Saturday he condemned the invasion, he again called the Russian leader “smart”. Cotton, from Arkansas, is a military veteran and foreign policy hawk with reputed presidential ambitions from the hard Republican right. His host on ABC, George Stephanopoulos, tried repeatedly to prize comment from him. Cotton was happy to condemn Putin and praise Ukrainian bravery – and to criticise US allies in Europe. “I know that they say they sanctioned 80% of the banks in Russia,” he said. “Well, Vladimir Putin controls 100% of the banks in Russia. He can use the other 20% to continue to finance his war machine. “It’s time to remove all Russian financial institutions from the international payment system. It’s time to impose sanctions on his oil and gas exports, which he uses as his primary means of financial support.” Stephanopoulos cited Trump calling Putin “smart” and “savvy” and “say[ing] Nato and the US are dumb”, and asked: “Are you prepared to condemn that kind of rhetoric from the leader of your party?” Cotton said: “George, you heard what I had to say about Vladimir Putin. That he is a ruthless dictator who’s launched a naked, unprovoked war of aggression. “Thankfully, the Ukrainian army has anti-tank missiles that President Obama would not supply, that we did supply last time Republicans were in charge in Washington. That’s why it’s so urgent that we continue to supply those weapons to Ukraine.” Stephanopoulos asked: “Why can’t you condemn Donald Trump for those comments?” Cotton said: “George, if you want to know what Donald Trump thinks about Vladimir Putin or any other topic, I’d encourage you to invite him on your show. I don’t speak on behalf of other politicians. They can speak for themselves. “I speak on behalf of Arkansans, who I talked to this week and who are appalled at what they saw in Ukraine and they want me right now to fight in Washington to support those brave Ukrainians.” Stephanopoulos said: “You’re a senior member of the Republican party. Donald Trump is the leader of the Republican party. He said last night again, suggested that he’d be running for president. When Fox News asked him if he had a message for Vladimir Putin, he said he has no message. “Why can’t you condemn that? I feel quite confident that if … a Barack Obama or Joe Biden said something like that, you’d be first in line to criticise him.” Cotton said: “Again, George, if you want to talk to the former president about his views or his message, you can have him on your show. “My message to Vladimir Putin is quite clear. He needs to leave Ukraine unless he wants to face moms and teenagers with Molotov cocktails and grandmothers and grandfathers with AK-47s for years to come.” Stephanopoulos varied his line of attack, asking: “If Donald Trump runs again, can you support him?” But Cotton wasn’t for picking. “George,” he said, “I’m not worried about this fall’s elections right now, much less an election two years from now. I’m focused on the naked war of aggression that Vladimir Putin has launched in Ukraine right now. There’s not a moment to lose. We can worry about electoral politics down the road.” Stephanopoulos tried once more. “Former President Trump was out there talking about it last night. I simply don’t understand why you can’t condemn his praise of Vladimir Putin.” “George,” said Cotton, “again, I don’t speak on behalf of other politicians. They can all speak for themselves.” Cotton’s refusal to criticise Trump – who has few critics in Congress and retains control of the Republican party – was not unique among Republicans but it was widely noted online. Reed Galen, a former Republican strategist now part of the anti-Trump Lincoln Project, wrote: “Tom Cotton is wily, like a Fennec fox. He’ll come up, look around, listen, then skitter back into his hole until the time is right.”",News/US news,Republican Tom Cotton refuses four times to condemn Trump on Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/27/republican-tom-cotton-trump-ukraine
2/28/2022,"Lloyd and Jean Warr, who survived flash flooding in 2011, have narrowly escaped with their lives once again after being rescued from Helidon in Queensland’s Lockyer Valley. Terrifying memories of the disaster a decade ago were reawakened this week across the valley where 23 people died in 2011. Memories of the Warrs’ ordeal rushed back to the surface on Friday as they huddled together on the roof of their ute. “It was scary for Jean,” Lloyd says. “I had trouble getting her out of the window of the ute.” Despite their planning, preparation and best efforts to leave early, the couple’s lives were again at risk late last week. Lloyd spent Friday morning packing a load of clothes and essentials and tried to take them to Toowoomba but the road was blocked and he had to return home. As they became concerned about rising levels in Lockyer Creek, they decided to take their two cars to higher ground. By the time they reached the creek causeway it was obvious Jean’s car would not be able to cross so they returned it to the garage and both got in the utility vehicle. The ute stalled on the causeway as the creek was rising alarmingly quickly. Jean feared they would die but Lloyd was determined they would survive – just as he was 11 years earlier – when they were trapped in their house in dangerous swift flood waters. On that occasion, they clung to their veranda posts and rose with the water level. Once close to the roof, Jean grabbed the gutter and received an electric shock that threw her off. Lloyd managed to grab her and then took four electric shocks himself testing the gutter until it was safe to climb on to the roof and help his wife up. Once on the roof, the water continued rising until only the peak of the roof was exposed but then subsided and they climbed down. This time, Lloyd again was determined they would survive. He told his wife to climb out the window of the ute and sit on the roof. Fortunately, some residents who were out checking local creek levels saw them stranded on the causeway and called police who alerted swift water rescuers. As the couple clung to each other hoping to be rescued, the water level rose almost to the roof of the ute. Lloyd realised they could not wait for help and decided to swim back to his property to get his boat to rescue Jean himself. He didn’t make it but managed to cling to a tree until help arrived to rescue Jean from the roof of the ute and Lloyd from the tree. While authorities tell people not to attempt to drive across flooded roads – “if it’s flooded, forget it” is the mantra – the couple had to flee, given that their low-lying home was completely submerged in 2011. “We have experience that not many will talk about,” Lloyd says of the trauma they’ve suffered. After the 2011 flood, their insurance payout was enough to fix the house but not enough to move it. They could not afford the house insurance premium that had risen to $34,000 a year so found an alternative insurer. Friday’s rescue has led them both to a firm resolve to move – but finding a buyer for their house might prove difficult. The Warrs were not able to access psychological help as they worked through their trauma after the 2011 event. “We were offered psychological help but we had to go to Brisbane to get it,” Lloyd says. “I can’t drive in city traffic, so we couldn’t access the help.” He admits now that for up to five years after the 2011 flood he felt suicidal, and it was only his mates who kept him going. In the past couple of years, the couple have decided to downsize and were ready to put up the “for sale” sign. Their plans have now been interrupted by another flood and weeks to months of cleaning up. They have a message for anyone helping in the clean-up. “In the clean-up, people who helped us threw a lot of things away – like clothes and electrical goods – that could have been saved. If you are helping, wash everything that can be washed and clean everything that can be cleaned,” Lloyd says. For now the couple are staying with relatives, washing the clothes they packed in the ute, hoping the rain stops and the creek level doesn’t rise again. Six inches of water flowed through their house, leaving a thin layer of mud. Insurance assessors are due on Monday. Lockyer Valley’s mayor, Tanya Milligan, says her focus is on preserving lives. The Australian defence force has been called in to assist with helicopter rescues of travellers from stranded cars and residents from the roofs of their houses. Grantham, the centre of flooding deaths in 2011, received almost 500mm of rain at the weekend – almost five times the monthly average for February, Milligan says. More than 140 travellers and residents who have evacuated their homes are sheltering with local fire brigades and at RSL halls. The repetition of a disaster like the 2011 flash floods has been challenging, the mayor says. “When I see footage of the floods, all I see in 2011,” she says. “The footage is devastating. “It breaks my heart but we will rebuild. We just want us all to get to the other side of this flood. “I’m holding my breath. We don’t want to lose anyone. We went to lots of funerals after 2011 and we want everyone to survive.” Milligan has asked people to be patient waiting for roads to open and urged them to check the Lockyer Valley disaster dashboard for updated information. The Brisbane-Toowoomba Highway is impassable due to flooding and road damage at Glenore Grove. It is expected to take several days for the damage to be assessed and repaired.

2/28/2022,"A thinktank linked to Japanese technology giant Canon is coming under pressure to remove multiple articles from a research director that describe the climate crisis as “fake news” and compares campaigner Greta Thunberg to a communist. One Australia-based international fellow at the Canon Institute for Global Studies (CIGS), Prof Jeffrey Braithwaite, told the Guardian the claims about climate science from research director Dr Taishi Sugiyama were “not defensible”. Campaign group Action Speaks Louder, which has produced a report documenting Sugiyama’s claims, says the institute is “promoting dangerous climate delay and denial” and is demanding Canon withdraws support until the articles, which include a book aimed at school-age children, are removed. In articles on the institute’s website and in other outlets, Sugiyama, using his CIGS affiliation, says there is no climate crisis, and rejects evidence of increasing heat extremes and more intense rainfall. During November’s Glasgow climate talks, Sugiyama, who has helped write several major UN climate reports, said a speech from the Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg showed she had “turned from an environmentalist to a communist”. Sugiyama also authored a book, published this year, encouraging Japanese school children to question the science of climate change. His work is often published on conservative outlet Daily Will, and then republished on the CIGS website. Braithwaite, an internationally respected healthcare expert who is a CIGS fellow, told the Guardian he found the content from Sugiyama on the CIGS website “deeply disconcerting”. Braithwaite said he raised concerns with the institute last week. The institute viewed its role, he said, as “trying to improve the world” and, like at a university, allowed its researchers a level of freedom. “But this is so far outside the norm and is not evidence based,” he said. “It is clearly against the assembled evidence on global warming and the changing climate and its effects. It is not defensible.” Braithwaite is a leading international expert on healthcare. He said: “This does not sit comfortably with someone like me who has been actively trying to recognise and promote the science on global warming and to consider its effects on human health. We need to follow the science.” Braithwaite said he would discuss his connections with the institute at a board meeting of the International Society For Quality In Health Care, of which he is president. Dr Seita Emori, a climate scientist at Japan’s National Institute for Environmental Studies, questioned Sugiyama’s reliability as a source on climate change, saying his interpretations of data contradicted the conclusions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. “I found his arguments use typical strategies of climate sceptics – if not contrarians – all over the world,” he said. On the site of another thinktank, Sugiyama has recommended several reports translated into Japanese from the UK-based Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) – a group founded by the former UK chancellor of the exchequer Lord Nigel Lawson and known for its antagonism towards climate science, the IPCC, renewable energy and policies for governments to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions. One GWPF report promoted by Sugiyama criticised a special IPCC report that looked at the benefits of keeping global heating at 1.5C. Sugiyama was a lead author on a chapter of that report examining the global response to cutting emissions. He is currently a lead author of a chapter of a major IPCC report, due next month, on ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions around the world. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In a 2021 article reproduced on the institute’s website, Sugiyama said there was “no sign of a catastrophe” and claims of a climate crisis and emergency was “fake news” and “such things do not exist anywhere”. Sugiyama questioned why CO2 needed to be reduced, saying intense heat was “not due to global warming” but the urban heat island effect – a known and well-studied phenomena where temperatures in cities can be pushed even higher because of radiated heat from concrete and buildings and a lack of green space. In December, Sugiyama attempted to argue sea ice at the poles was not decreasing. According to a leaflet on the CIGS website, the institute was launched in 2008 to commemorate Canon’s 70th birthday. The Canon chief executive, Fujio Mitarai, is the institute’s chairman and has said it “conducts various research activities in line with Canon’s corporate philosophy of kyosei – living and working together for the common good – with the aim of contributing to global prosperity and the well-being of humankind”. James Lorenz, the executive director of Action Speaks Louder, a campaign group that is publishing a report on the material promoted by CIGS, said Canon’s brand “is being leveraged as a platform to promote dangerous climate denial to children and conduct high-level policy advocacy in favour of fossil fuels”. He said Canon needed to withdraw support for the institute until publications questioning climate change, including Sugiyama’s children’s book that is for sale at the institute, were removed from its website. Dylan Tanner, the executive director of InfluenceMap, a thinktank that analyses corporate action on climate change, told the Guardian: “While one may offer that a diversity of views is useful to debate, the papers emanating from Sugiyama on climate change are so far removed from IPCC consensus that they are likely to be viewed as deliberately propagating climate denial.” Any oversight by CIGS should have raised issues about the content, he said. “The risk is that it may thus be seen as climate stances condoned by CIGS and its leadership.” He said Canon, one of Japan’s most successful companies, faced a “real reputation risk” given its own positions on environmental sustainability. The Guardian asked Canon if it financially supported CIGS and if the company believed Sugiyama’s views were consistent with its corporate philosophy to contribute to global well-being. In a statement, the company said CIGS was a private non-profit thinktank that operated independently and was not part of its business. The statement said: “Therefore, we are not in a position to comment on the activities of the institute or individual research.” CIGS did not answer questions about how it was funded or if it reviewed materials placed on its website before publication. A statement said: “As Dr Sugiyama is studying energy and environmental issues on his own knowledge and responsibility, we are not going to answer each of your questions.” The Guardian sent questions to Sugiyama twice by email, but received no response.",News/Environment,Thinktank linked to tech giant Canon under pressure to remove ‘dangerous’ climate articles,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/27/thinktank-linked-to-tech-giant-canon-under-pressure-to-remove-dangerous-climate-articles
2/28/2022,"The last video call Michelle and Carolyn had with their dad was on Christmas Day. “Two of my daughters made bids for his attention by singing bright songs, accompanying them with actions. I joined in,” Carolyn says. “It was so much fun … he roused from his drowsiness and smiled and clapped.” Three weeks later, Apostolos Ioannis “Jack” Moulos died in aged care from Covid-19. Like so many others, his family were unable to say goodbye. “The last two years we’ve had really limited contact with Dad,” his daughter, Michelle says. “And it’s not anyone’s fault … it’s just sad.” Jack was born in 1924 in a weatherboard cottage in Singleton, a riverside town on the banks of the Hunter valley. Sixteen years earlier, his father had arrived in Australia via ship from Kythera – a small, poor Ionian island in southern Greece – with no English and little education. He was one of hundreds of Kytherians who carved a unique place in Australia’s multicultural tapestry, establishing what were then modern cafes in regional towns, known as Greek cafes. The Niagara Café , opened in Singleton by his father, would be the place Jack grew up and devoted much of his life. The Niagara was housed in an old art deco-style building, with potted palms and soda fountains. It was a cultural hub in Singleton, the place where Jack fell in love with books, jazz and classical music. At age 17, Jack signed up as a fitter and turner in the second world war. He experienced no direct conflict in the three years he served in Labuan, Malaysia, but he later told his daughters he missed books so terribly during the war he would go to the latrine just to reread old newspapers hanging as toilet paper. ‘Dad was very, very thoughtful, very introverted,” Michelle says. “He had an interest in the world … strong views that he kept to himself. He chose his words so carefully and sparingly … when he said them, they were precious.” When Jack returned from the war, he continued to help out in the shop and enrolled in university in Sydney, where he would meet his future wife, Doreen, at a debutante’s ball. Jack didn’t know this till much later, but Doreen took one look at him and thought: “I want him to father my children”. They would marry in 1951, and he did, fathering Carolyn and Michelle. The couple went on to spend 20 years “minding the cafe”, at night sleeping above the shop where Jack grew up as a child. Every day, he donned dark trousers with a leather belt, a collared white shirt and a long white apron. Customers would roll in from the Strand Cinema next door at all hours of the day and night, filling large jugs with beer from barrels in the shed or drinking an espresso served by Jack from the first machine in the Upper Hunter. When he wasn’t cooking in the kitchen or serving behind the counter, Jack developed a deep passion for photography, and constructed a darkroom at the end of the veranda above The Niagara. Later, he opened a studio where he took many portraits and wedding photos. Jack’s talent was such he became the stringer cameraman for the Upper Hunter for ABC, Channel 9 and Channel 3 news stations, when television in Australia was still in its infancy. His daughters say his light meter and his camera were like his wallet – he rarely left the house without them slung around his neck. “He was just an incredible person,” Michelle says. “When I rang to tell one of our cousins that Uncle Jack had died, he said, ‘Uncle Jack, not Uncle Jack. Oh, he was so kind and so open minded.’” In 1986, Jack and Doreen moved into a duplex six doors down from Carolyn to take care of Doreen’s mother. Carolyn and her family lived with them for almost two years on and off while their house was being renovated. She says Jack and Doreen became like second parents to her five daughters later in life. Always busy working long hours when Carolyn was a child, in his retirement Jack finally had the time to devote himself to his grandchildren. “They love him deeply,” she says. “In his last years in residential aged care, his face would light up when the great-grandchildren and their cousins visited. He loved being with them, talking to them and singing with them. They brought him joy and delight.” The deep family bond was what made it so difficult for Jack when Covid restrictions prevented his grandchildren from visiting. At age 88, Jack began to develop dementia, made hard by Doreen’s death seven years later at the beginning of the pandemic. “We found the frequent and prolonged lockdowns heart-wrenching,” Carolyn says. During restrictions, a staff member was able to facilitate video calls between residents and families, which, despite his dementia, Jack eventually warmed to. It wasn’t the same, but it was something. Then the floor went into strict lockdown after positive Covid cases were detected. Only essential staff were allowed to enter – the video calls stopped. Jack’s late stage of dementia prevented him from making phone calls unassisted. “For a man who loved and cared for his family all his life, extended periods of separation must have been so lonely,” Carolyn says. “He would ask sometimes, ‘where have you been?’ or, ‘when are you coming to see us again?’ Each time we would explain that there was a really bad flu going around and we are trying not to spread it. He’d agree we were doing the right thing. “That was no lasting comfort because his short-term memory was so poor. He was aware of time passing and that it was a long time between visits when there were lockdowns.” On 15 January, Jack passed away at Presbyterian Aged Care with Covid-19, two carers by his side. They both knew him well – they used to call him “Papou”. He was 97. Before he died, Jack was comforted by the knowledge his daughter, Michelle was on her way to see him. At 6.30am, the family had been instructed they were allowed an end-of-life visit, just three hours before he died. “She’s on her way,” the nurse told Jack. “Michelle is on her way.” Sadly, Jack passed during her drive from Milton to Sydney. “He breathed in, one breath out, and that was it,” Carolyn says. “We were glad someone was with him, because that’s what he said when we did advanced care – ‘all I want is someone holding my hand’. “We [just] wish it had been us.” Michelle says there’s a context to her father’s death – to have died at this particular time, in this particular place, that makes it so sad – so wrong. “Normally, we would have gathered with him when he first became unwell,” she wrote, after his death. “He would have had lots of visitors, and maybe Carolyn and I would have been with him at 9.17am when he died. “We would have, then, spent some days together – me at Carolyn’s house, receiving lots of different visitors of different generations for cups of tea and stories. We would have cried and laughed together.” Instead, Michelle and her daughter stood in full PPE to view Jack’s body through a glass door, while Carolyn and the rest of Sydney family were confined to their homes with Covid-19. “None of this is normal,” Michelle wrote. “Me driving three-and-a-half hours back from Sydney to my home in Milton, alone. “Sitting on my front veranda, feeling like I’d been to outer space and back, while everyone else just had a normal day.”",News/Australia news,"Pilot, cafe owner, photographer: family remembers ‘incredible’ great-grandfather who died from Covid",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/28/pilot-cafe-owner-photographer-family-remembers-incredible-great-grandfather-who-died-from-covid
2/28/2022,"What if a critically endangered bird could be given a chance at survival by protecting just 7% of Tasmanian native forests earmarked for logging? And what if the Tasmanian forestry administrators had – for different reasons – already argued that logging should be reduced by roughly that amount? That’s the case made in a proposal that ecologists and environmentalists believe could halt the steep decline of the swift parrot, a migratory species that experts say could be extinct in 10 years if no action is taken. Monitoring the world’s fastest parrot is challenging. It spends the winter in Victoria and New South Wales before nesting in different parts of Tasmania each summer, depending on where its main food source, the blue gum, is flowering. But no one disputes that swift parrot numbers have slumped. A CSIRO-published birds guide released in December puts the population at about 750, down from 2,000 roughly a decade ago. A new report released by BirdLife Australia, the Wilderness Society and the Tasmanian group the Tree Projects says the primary cause is the loss of large, hollow-bearing trees used for breeding. It cites a peer-reviewed study that found nearly a quarter of Tasmania’s southern old-growth forests were logged between 1997 and 2016 – evidence, it says, of a systemic failure by the state government to act on repeated scientific advice that protecting parrot habitat was crucial for the species to survive. Dr Jennifer Sanger, a forest ecologist with Tree Projects, says while the parrot faces other threats, including predation from sugar gliders and worsening bushfire risk due to the climate crisis, habitat loss from logging remains the “number one” issue. “Unfortunately what we’ve seen from the government is inadequate policies over the past decade that have been exacerbating the decline,” she says. “The habitat is still being logged.” The Tasmanian Liberal government says it has an answer. In late 2020 it released a policy, known as the public authority management agreement, under which it has promised to set aside 9,300 hectares of southern forests from logging. The report, On the Edge of Extinction, argues this is misleading as 69% of the newly set aside area was already excluded from logging, either due to operational constraints or parts of it already being in reserves. In reality, it says, the new policy would stop logging in only 2,900ha, and leave other areas with the mature trees the swift parrot relies on available to the forestry industry. Scientific advice to the government says all swift parrot foresting and nesting habitat on Tasmanian public land should be protected to give the species a chance. This is not a new argument but the report includes what the groups say is a new calculation of what this would mean. It says a swift parrot protection plan would require the industry to give up just 7% of the forest area on state land available for logging. It would protect 40,000ha more mature forest and 20,000ha of regrowing forest that could provide future habitat. It says this could be achieved by listening to the board of the state-owned forestry business, Sustainable Timber Tasmania, which in 2016 told the state government logging was not profitable if it had to meet a legislated quota of providing 137,000 cubic metres of sawlogs a year. It called for this to be cut to 96,000 cubic metres – a 30% cut in timber supply. The call by the industry body was rejected by the state resources minister, Guy Barnett. The Liberal state government was elected in 2014 on a platform of ending a Labor-Greens “peace deal” brokered between the industry and environmentalists after decades of conflict and expanding native forestry to support jobs in regional communities. Barnett says the existing sawlog quota could be met by selling timber for higher prices while looking for lower cost areas of forest to log. The groups behind the report say the quota should be dropped entirely, but that reducing it to the level nominated by Sustainable Timber Tasmania could be enough to stabilise parrot numbers. Sanger says it would also help other species, and retain a significant amount of carbon stored in the state’s mature wet eucalyptus forests. “In a perfect world there would be no native forest logging, but to protect the parrot they really don’t have to do much,” she says. “At the moment they are doing nothing, really.” Asked about the report last week, the Tasmanian environment minister, Roger Jaensch, said cutting the legislated sawlog quota was “not part of our thinking”. He said the government had committed $1m to implement priorities from a swift parrot recovery plan and he was getting advice from officials on how that money should be spent. “We’ve already made significant changes to harvesting arrangements in areas where there is swift parrot habitat,” Jaensch said. Suzette Weeding, a general manager with Sustainable Timber Tasmania, says the current policy is a “significant step forward” in swift parrot protection, the agency “recognises its responsibility as a land manager” and a management plan including additional measures is being developed. She suggests the industry’s economic circumstances have changed since it called for the sawlog quota to be reduced in 2016. Sustainable Timber Tasmania’s annual reports show it has posted an operating profit for the past four years. The economist John Lawrence says it would have recorded losses if not for accounting measures and government grants. Dr Eric Woehler, an ecologist and the convenor of BirdLife Tasmania, says the government and agency’s plans do not go far enough to halt the “catastrophic decrease” in parrot numbers, and the strength of the report is that it “basically aligns with what the industry has asked for”. “What it shows is that, with some strategic thinking and planning, we are in a position to ease the pressure on a critically endangered species,” he says. “It’s not rocket science.” The only thing standing in the way, according to Woehler, is “political unwillingness”. “The problem is well-known, has been for decades, and we’ve seen a weakening of protection and a business-as-usual approach to land management in the state,” he says. “It’s a recipe for the extinction of a species.”",News/Environment,‘It’s not rocket science’: how the world’s fastest parrot could be saved,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/27/swift-parrot-its-not-rocket-science-how-we-could-save-the-worlds-fastest-parrot
2/28/2022,"Gavin is a good-looking man in his early thirties who strode confidently into the consulting room. At first glance, it was hard to guess that his self-assured manner was masking a profound uncertainty and considerable psychological difficulties. But as the incongruity between his persona and his subjective sense of self was slowly revealed, it became clear that he was suffering from a profound sense of disconnection at multiple levels following a highly traumatic event. This sense of disconnection is a key characteristic of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In response to trauma, the parts of the brain responsible for our survival responses are quickly activated and override our usual processing of emotion via thought. Thus, there is a disconnection between instinctive feeling states/reactions and our cognitive processing systems. But, as Gavin’s story illustrates, trauma elicits a sense of disconnection that runs deeper than this blunt survival response. A traumatic event takes place outside us, but the effects of this have deep internal reverberations. One of the most striking of the different levels of disconnection Gavin had was the disjunct between his sense of self before and after the traumatic event. As Gavin put it shortly after we met, he had come to therapy because “I don’t know who I am any more. I used to know but now I don’t.” Dr Gabe Mate famously defines the essence of trauma as “disconnection from ourselves”, and this certainly appeared to describe Gavin’s experience. Gavin related how his life had been radically altered on the day that a man had been violently murdered in front of him and his girlfriend in a local park. He later learned that this stabbing attack had occurred as part of a gang feud. Since this incident, Gavin had been experiencing flashbacks to the event and a feeling of constant hyper-vigilance. Whereas in the past he had thought of himself as an even-tempered and balanced person, he now frequently felt jumpy and over-stimulated and had “a short fuse”. These times alternated with periods of feeling “numb and out of it”, accompanied by feelings of depression and meaninglessness. Gavin confessed “I either feel too much or too little. So, who am I? The guy who feels too much or the guy who feels too little?” Gavin described himself as tormented and conflicted as he believed that he had been cowardly in not trying to intervene in the attack. He lamented that “the image I had of myself before that day and the image I now have are poles apart.” Although his girlfriend had repeatedly assured him that there was nothing he could have done differently, he found himself unable to believe that she was not judging him. As a result, he had ended the relationship. Being with her reminded him of what had happened and how he had “failed”. He had also been increasingly avoiding his male friends out of a sense of shame and he even felt distanced from his close-knit family. There were moments when he felt so agitated and irritable that he believed that it was better to be alone. As Gavin and I unpacked his story, it became increasingly clear that he was suffering from the classic symptoms of PTSD. While the flashbacks and anxiety were troubling for him, he found the sense of disconnection even more distressing. He felt a disconcerting sense of dissociation from his body, he had become untethered from a stable sense of self, he felt alienated from a sense of continuity or predictability of life, and he was interpersonally isolated from friends, intimate relationships and family. He also felt disconnected at a spiritual and existential level, as life no longer appeared to have any meaning or purpose. Yet, at the same time, he found himself preoccupied with mortality. The difficulties Gavin was experiencing in the wake of his exposure to an acute trauma were multifaceted and complex and it was clear that a multi-pronged approach to treatment would be necessary. An important priority was to assist Gavin in altering the rapidity with which his brain was pushing him towards automatic fight, flight and freeze responses. In this regard, a therapy called eye movement desensitisation and reprogramming (EMDR) was deemed helpful. A second priority was to reconnect him with his body and to urge him to re-engage with the gym and exercise, which he had been doing before the incident. A third priority was to deal with all the psychological and interpersonal disconnections that had flowed from the event. It was recommended that he engage in psychotherapy, so that his reactions to the event could be processed and normalised and his internal conflicts and guilt addressed. Gavin went on to make good progress in therapy and to reconnect with both himself and the world. Part of the work was to help him to come to a deeper acceptance of the fragility of life and its essential unpredictability, rather than to restore him to a sense of invincibility. In some ways PTSD puts us more in touch with life’s realities and strips us of the usual veils that we draw over these in order to protect ourselves. In a paradoxical manner, if the realities unmasked by trauma can be accepted and integrated, we can be more authentically connected to life than we were before. Nietzsche famously said that a person can be measured by how much truth can be borne without diluting or muting it. To accept the truth of our own vulnerability and the unpredictability of the world is a task indeed and the working through of trauma does provide us with this opportunity.

2/28/2022,"Groundbreaking research into the long-term ramifications of concussion in sport has found chronic traumatic encephalopathy in the brains of more than half of a cohort of donors, including three under the age of 35. The Australian Sports Brain Bank on Monday reported its preliminary findings after examining the 21 brains posthumously donated by sportspeople since the centre’s inception in 2018. Of those – all of whom had played sports with risks of repetitive head injury, including 17 in football codes – 12 donors were found to have CTE lesions, while all but one exhibited some form of neurodegeneration. CTE, which can only be definitively diagnosed at autopsy, is a neurodegenerative condition linked to repeated head traumas. Symptoms experienced during life include cognitive impairment, impulsive behaviour, depression, suicidal thoughts, short-term memory loss and emotional instability. Among the group with CTE are the already-reported cases of high-profile Australian rules footballers Danny Frawley, Shane Tuck and Polly Farmer, along with two anonymous former professional rugby league players. Both Frawley and Tuck took their own lives, while Farmer had Alzheimer’s – another condition linked to head injuries. But the additional findings made by Associate Professor Michael Buckland, a neuropathologist at the Royal Prince Alfred hospital and the University of Sydney, and his brain bank colleagues, underlined the prevalence and severity of traumatic brain injury across all age groups and levels of collision-based sport. “CTE was identified in the brains of older former professionals with long playing careers, but also in younger, nonprofessional sportsmen and in recent professionals who had played under modern concussion guidelines,” wrote Buckland and his fellow researchers in the paper published by the Medical Journal of Australia. “Three donors with CTE were under 35 years of age. Six of the 12 donors with CTE and one of nine without CTE had died by suicide, suggesting CTE may be a suicide risk factor. “Screening for CTE in all deaths by suicide is probably impractical, but our finding suggests it should be undertaken if a history of repetitive head injury is known or suspected.” The conversation around the link between concussion – and subclinical concussion – and irreversible brain injury have engulfed collision-based sports globally. In Australia, class actions against the governing bodies of football codes in particular are attracting more and more present and former players, increasing the pressure on sporting institutions to act in a manner commensurate with this unfolding epidemic. The less frequently reported victims are amateur athletes, whom this research has concluded are no less at risk than their professional counterparts. The researchers acknowledged that “ascertainment bias for abnormal neuropathology was inevitable” given brain donations were motivated by either clinical diagnoses or the concerns of family members. But they also stated it was “remarkable that CTE was found in more than half of these cases”. “Moreover,” they wrote, “in half of the donor brains with CTE, it was the sole neurodegenerative pathology … our findings should encourage clinicians and policymakers to develop measures that further mitigate the risk of sport-related repetitive head injury.” Since 2018 the brain has received more than 600 donation pledges from amateur and professional sportspeople.",Sport/Sport,Concussion in sport: CTE found in more than half of sportspeople who donated brains,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/28/concussion-in-sport-cte-found-in-more-than-half-of-sportspeople-who-donated-brains
2/28/2022,"How do you get a creature feature broadcast on ABC TV, which has an average viewer age of approximately 105? You smuggle it into a show about an outback detective! I’m being slightly facetious, although this is actually the style in which the first episode of the entertaining and moreish tropical Queensland-set crime drama Troppo begins: with a perturbed-looking bloke dressed in undies getting munched on by a crocodile. A group of sightseers are on a boat steered by a tour guide with a flair for the theatrical, talking up the foul stench of a croc’s breath and how human bodies make it “reek of death.” Then the aforementioned man summons the reptile’s attention and swims towards it – making this an apparent “suicide by crocodile”. In terms of icky genre thrills and spills, the show’s creator, Yolanda Ramke, has form: she co-directed the 2017 zombie movie Cargo, starring Martin Freeman as an infected man desperately trying to find someone to look after his wee bub before he turns into a flesh-muncher. Filling a surprising gap in the outback TV detective genre, notwithstanding the excellent albeit comparatively recent Mystery Road spin-offs, this eight-part series, inspired by Candice Fox’s bestselling book Crimson Lake, is addictive in an airport novel sort of way: steeped in formula but quite appealingly written, performed and directed (by Jocelyn Moorhouse, Catherine Millar, Grant Brown and Ben Howling). At its core is an amusingly testy dynamic between the two principal characters. The tattoo-covered, shaved-headed Amanda (Nicole Chamoun) is toughness personified: lots of steely looks and attitude-filled dialogue (including “touch my shit, I break your face!”). The other is former cop Ted (US fly-in Thomas Jane, star of 2004’s The Punisher) who we meet while indulged in a bit of hard drinkin’ and is potentially suicidal – but also a decent bloke. We know that because he takes pity on an injured goose and brings it to the vet, continuing a long tradition of softening hard men by associating them with cute animals (think Tony Soprano and his ducks and John Wick and his doggo). We briefly meet the lead engineer of a deep sea mining company, Park Jong Min (Sonny Le), who pours whiskey into his laptop keyboard – causing it to malfunction (which I do from time to time, but for him it’s intentional) – then goes missing. Park’s wife, Yoon Sun (Sun Park), only hires the inexperienced Amanda, a wannabe private investigator, to track him down after Amanda assures her that she has an old gumshoe partner with more runs on the board – then wrangles assistance from Ted. The pair make a reasonably entertaining combination, Amanda testy in a “don’t have time for this” manner and Ted in the wearier way of a “been there, done that” defeatist. Intensity-wise she cranks the dial up and he turns it down – though both performances are heightened in slightly odd ways, as if from separate narrative universes. Jane does the rough blokey-bloke down under thing, with his wide brimmed hat and his gruffness, and Chamoun is the cosmopolitan type more likely to be hanging about in a laneway than a cornfield. They go snooping around, sticking their noses into places they don’t belong and narrowly escape dangerous situations – you know the drill. When we see Damien Garvey (so good at playing slippery characters) appear as the CEO of the deep sea mining company, Dellagua, we know it must be hiding some kind of jiggery-pokery. Detective stories often present vertical narratives, in the sense they build a hierarchy for characters on a lower social level (Jack Irish, for instance) to penetrate. The tour guide from the chompalicious introductory scene returns to deliver a title drop in episode two (this review encompasses the first four), discussing how it’s about time someone took an interest in his community, because “the whole place is out of whack”, with crocodiles “acting up” and people “going troppo, driven mad by the tropical heat”. It’s a shame that this heat had to be referenced rather than expressed visually: the show would have benefited from a hot, sticky look – like in These Final Hours or Phillip Noyce’s 1982 film, Heatwave – rather than its airier, lighter, even autumnal aesthetics. There’s not much originality in the writing, but the dynamic between the two bothered characters works for the aforementioned reasons and the pace has a decent ebb and flow. The tropical Queensland location allows for some fun settings and scenarios – from wildlife interactions to a man (played by Simon Lyndon, aka Jimmy Loughnan in Chopper) whose version “of an apple a day” is injecting himself with snake venom. You don’t get that in the CBD; at least not at your local chemist. Nor do you tend to see, on the ABC, outside of nature documentaries, shows with beastly predators and grisly deaths.",Arts/Television & radio,Troppo review: addictive Queensland detective drama – with crocodiles,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/28/troppo-review-addictive-queensland-detective-drama-with-crocodiles
2/28/2022,"“One-nil, to the Arsenal. One-nil, to the Arsenal.” It is perhaps unthinkable to those reared on Arsène Wenger’s Invincibles but, during the early ’90s, this was the defining ethos of the Gunners; belted out by supporters as George Graham’s side attempted to bore opponents to death before, up the other end, Ian Wright could pop up to provide a winner. These days, nobody is going to be confusing Jamie Young for David Seaman or or Léo Lacroix for Tony Adams, and we can only hope John Aloisi’s tenure in Melbourne’s west does not end in a similar fashion to Graham’s in north London. However, almost 30 years on from that chant ringing out over Highbury, A-League Men leaders Western United are performing their own little tribute to that side: riding a wave of one-goal victories to the top of the table and, potentially, league glory. A bit fitting, really, given that some recounts about Arsenal’s adoption of the chant claim it was inspired by a rendition of the Pet Shop Boys’ version of Go West at half-time during a European Cup Winners’ Cup semi-final against Paris Saint-Germain – the same song which has been a regular part of United’s rotation since they entered the competition in 2019-20. Active supporters in the ‘Western Service Crew’ have not adopted the Gunners’ mocking chant as their own just yet but, across their opening 14 games of the 2021-22 ALM season, Aloisi’s side have already equalled the record number of regular-season 1-0 wins recorded by a team in national league history. Their new bedfellows – Perth Glory’s 1999-2000 National Soccer League side – did that in a 34-game campaign. They have already better their wins total from the 2020-21 campaign and, following Sunday night’s 2-0 win over Perth, have also bettered their 2020-21 points total. To steal another Pet Shop Boys’ work, though, what has made United’s exercise in efficiency such an interesting watch (in a macro sense – their individual games, as the 1-0 scorelines suggest, can tend to drag) is that they have hardly been Very Relentless. No side has had less of the ball than United so far this season and they sit decidedly mid-table in goals scored and metrics such as shots on target per 90 minutes and expected goals per 90 minutes. But – with apologies for stating the obvious – what United can do is defend. They have conceded the equal fewest goals per game this season. And once they have a lead? Forget about it. The sustainability of this approach will be tested as the season goes on, but what is obvious watching this side going about it is that they genuinely seem to be playing for Aloisi. The former Socceroos’ striker has had his ups and downs in previous jobs but few would argue about his genuineness, ability to connect with people and the spirit he has fostered at his current club. Often in Australian football, being a ‘good bloke’ can paper over all manners of sins. But looking at United’s ability to close out games, a healthy dressing room and sense of togetherness can serve to mitigate tactical and technical limitations elsewhere – especially in the face of opposition with their own limitations. “The togetherness of the club, of the team, is massive,” Aloisi said last week. “We spent a lot of time working on that in pre-season and making sure that the players understand what we’re about as a football club, as a team, and how to instil that work ethic and working for each other. “People don’t realise in pre-season we were training on some terrible pitches, but the boys didn’t complain once. It’s not only working them hard – that’s the easy thing to do. You can run someone easily; you have to give them a reason.” Being intangible, however, vibes can be fleeting, and United’s run to the final has the potential to break any team. Aloisi and his players forced to cash cheques written by others, their lack of a proper home of their own – a subject of ongoing controversy and ill-will given that the delivery of such a stadium was the centrepiece of their acceptance into the A-Leagues – means that their coming ‘home’ fixtures will be split across Tasmania, Ballarat and Melbourne. Combine this with an average age of 30.7 thus far this season – the only ALM side to crack the 30 mark – and their run to the finals suddenly looks very taxing. The destabilising effects of this nomadic lifestyle at the tail end of the season ultimately played a key role in breaking the back of the club’s 2020-21 season and, with it Mark Rudan’s time as a coach. Time will tell if Aloisi can avoid a similar fate.",Sport/Football,Western United are slow and steady but winning the A-League Men race | Joey Lynch,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/28/western-united-are-slow-and-steady-but-winning-the-a-league-men-race
2/28/2022,"It was only after Julia Gillard invited him to review the funding of Australia’s schools in 2010 that David Gonski realised how much education had transformed his own life. “I remember sitting with Ken Boston and, I suspect, Kathryn Greiner, in a subcommittee we were planning. And it suddenly hit me – it was like a bolt out of the blue – that my father was educationally disadvantaged,” Gonski recalls almost a decade later. “I hadn’t thought that through before because my dad was a brain surgeon. And so I started to talk to my mother – my father was already dead – and it all came to me so clearly.” David Gonski’s grandparents were dirt-poor migrants from eastern Europe, who arrived in South Africa with little money and even less English. Their son, Gonski’s father, was an extremely bright child, but it was only the assistance of philanthropic scholarships that enabled him to continue studies beyond school, eventually completing a degree in medicine. When David was still a boy, his parents left South Africa for Australia, where he would rise to become one of the country’s leading businessmen, a famed networker among Sydney’s rich and powerful, and a noted patron of the arts and philanthropist in his own right. “Ultimately what happened because of that beneficence was that my father became a brain surgeon, and I had a great life,” Gonski reflects. “I had never focused on my dear dad until we started talking about this. And then I realised, actually this was the destiny of the review.” One morning in early 2011, in the course of conducting the school funding review that would bear his name, Gonski left his Point Piper home to visit two primary schools, Villawood North Public school and Sacred Heart school, in Sydney’s west. Upon arriving at the first school, he discovered the principal dealing with broken glass from a break-in the night before. As he sat waiting in the school’s reception, Gonski observed the flow of children arriving for the school day: almost all were, like his father, the children of migrants from non-English-speaking backgrounds; many were from families as poor as his father’s had been. When the principal had finished dealing with the immediate issues, he and Gonski toured the school, discussing the challenges it faced. “Most of his kids didn’t see a book outside the school,” Gonski recalls to us, his shock still apparent. “ No books!” “I asked [the principal] the question: ‘what is the relationship between the school and the parents?’ Because I was interested,” Gonski says. “‘What’s the involvement of parents?’” It was a reasonable question and yet, as soon as he asked it, Gonski realised how removed he was from the realities facing this school. The principal looked at him, smiled and said, “David, my job is to get the kids in here by 9am in the morning. Getting the parents in here at all is almost an impossibility,” adding that 40% of the student roll changed each year and his focus that year was on improving attendance. Gonski’s next destination was just down the road. He thought he would go on foot, but the principal advised him to drive. “He was just not happy [with my assuming] that it was safe for me to walk – something I’d never thought of in my own city.” It is possible to imagine Gonski driving away from the school, pondering his father’s story. How likely was it that a child of poor migrants with little English, growing up in these circumstances, would end up becoming a neurosurgeon? A growing body of evidence suggested it was increasingly improbable. Naplan (National Assessment Program – Literacy and Numeracy) results in 2009 showed that Year 9 students in hardscrabble areas of Sydney had poorer literacy and numeracy than Year 5 children in the wealthier parts of town that Gonski was more familiar with. It seemed that our schools were merely reproducing inequalities that existed outside the school gate – and sometimes making them even worse. Only a few minutes’ drive away, Sacred Heart school seemed a world away. “I saw just in that morning the difference between the way the schools were operating,” Gonski reflects, almost a decade later. “Every child was perfectly turned out in magnificent school uniforms. I was greeted by a concert, which was a short one – beautiful singing by the kids. The headmaster was in total control of his buildings. They were perfect.” This school served a quite different group of children from the school down the road. Gonski asked the principal whether he faced the truancy problems experienced at the school he had just come from. “Truancy? I’ve got a waiting list for the school! If we have truancy, I tell the parents to take their kids away.” David Gonski believed that the opportunity his father had had to transform his lot should be the birthright of every Australian child; that “differences in educational outcomes should not be the result of differences in wealth, income, power or possessions,” in the words of the report that would take his name. “Even though we were immigrants to this country, my father had a very good profession. He saved lives. I had a lovely life. Why? Because of education.” And yet that morning in 2011, visiting those two nearby schools in western Sydney, Gonski had witnessed close-up the growing divergence between the responsibilities Australian schools faced and the resources they had to meet them. The Gonski review found that in successful school systems internationally, students were able to achieve their best irrespective of their background or the school they attended. But that was less the case in Australia. The impact of family background on educational outcomes in Australia was much more pronounced than in comparable countries like Canada. And the gap in the learning outcomes between disadvantaged Australian children and their more privileged peers was growing. In response to these challenges, the Gonski report offered a seemingly compelling solution. First, identify the resourcing enjoyed by those schools where most students were achieving above-minimum national standards. Then, take that as the best guide to the necessary resourcing for a successful education and call it the baseline level of funding which all students should receive. It would also be necessary to provide additional funding loadings on top of the baseline for those children who experience disadvantages that impede their learning, and for schools in remote or rural locations, or with small student populations, that face higher costs. Thirdly, set up an architecture to continuously verify and evaluate the calculations underpinning the first two steps. Implementing Gonski’s resource standard would require a substantial national investment – a 15% increase on current expenditure. Modelling conducted by the review indicated that three-quarters of the additional spending would flow to public schools, reflecting the high levels of social disadvantage in that sector. But where disadvantaged students were enrolled in non-government schools, they too would receive additional resourcing. School funding would be needs-based and sector-blind. And yet, despite all the optimism generated by the Gonski report and the remarkable consensus that coalesced around it, the problems of Australian education have only worsened since the report was commissioned. International tests show that young Australians are getting less and less out of the education we are providing them. Underlying the headline averages, we find the same old equity story in which social disadvantage is a powerful predictor of low educational achievement. On average, kids from the poorest quarter of the population are three years of learning behind children in the top quarter. In 2010, Prime Minister Julia Gillard insisted that demography should not determine destiny, but the reality for far too many Australian children in 2022 is that it still does. Visiting those schools – Villawood North Public school and Sacred Heart school – in 2011, David Gonski witnessed the real distance between them. A decade later, something has certainly changed, but not in the way he had hoped. The two schools are now much further apart. While they are both in a low SES area, 66% of Villawood North Public school’s enrolment now falls into the most disadvantaged quarter, up from 46% in 2011. Just 30% of the Catholic school’s enrolment falls into this quarter. Given such a change, it could be expected that the funding differences between the schools would reflect the relative needs of each school’s enrolment. But that hasn’t happened. For the following seven years, government per-student funding alone to the Catholic school exceeded government funding to the poorer public school. Today, the less needy school still has a resource advantage, particularly when fee income is added to its public funding. In its configuration and implementation, the review that carried his name had failed one of these two schools visited by David Gonski. Even more important are the implications of this for student achievement. Using Naplan as a guide, the Catholic school doesn’t seem to be going backwards, but neither is it going forward. Its Year 5 reading and numeracy scores have remained largely unchanged, as has the school’s position compared with schools enrolling similar students. By contrast, the increasingly disadvantaged public school’s reading and numeracy scores have fallen. While many things have an impact on school achievement, the school’s increasing concentration of disadvantaged children, along with declining results, points to the hold that peer effects have on learning outcomes. The achievement gaps between the two schools have widened. The Gonski review, somewhat heroically, explained how Australia’s schools were funded. Achieving greater equity, it said, was critical. We weren’t there in 2011; we still aren’t there today. As far as needs-based funding goes, all we have is a greater commitment to the rhetoric.
