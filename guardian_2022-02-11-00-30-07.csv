2/11/2022,"A bitter dispute between university staff and their employers looks set to escalate after it emerged that university bosses have been advised to dock 100% of pay for staff who work to rule as part of industrial action which begins next week. More than 1 million students at 68 UK universities are to be hit by further strike action by members of the University and College Union (UCU), with up to 10 days of campus walkouts starting on Monday as part of a long-running dispute over pensions, pay and conditions.  UCU members also have a mandate to take action short of a strike including working to contract, not covering for absent colleagues, not rescheduling lectures or classes cancelled due to strike action and refusing to do voluntary activities. In the event of such action, however, the Universities and Colleges Employers’ Association has recommended that universities should withhold full pay for what it describes as “partial performance of duties”. It is up to individual institutions to decide but the UCU has warned of more strike action if universities go ahead with “punitive” deductions. Raj Jethwa, UCEA’s chief executive, told a briefing on Thursday: “[Universities] are not only entitled [to withhold full pay], we think they are compelled do so. The legal position is pretty robust, but beyond that we think the moral position of employers is robust as well.” He said students, who have already endured two years of disruption due to Covid and other factors, would suffer further as a result of the action and universities needed to protect the student experience. So far the number of universities adopting the UCEA recommendation appears to be small. According to the union six universities have threatened to withhold full pay over action short of a strike, while others are warning of deductions of 25%, 33% or 50%. The union says Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), City University of London, Manchester Metropolitan University, Newcastle University, the University of Bristol, and the University of Bradford have all threatened to withdraw 100% of pay for action short of a strike. UCU general secretary, Jo Grady, accused university bosses of trying to intimidate staff from taking lawful industrial action by withholding their wages. “This is a deeply unfair and unprofessional response from management which will only escalate and prolong these disputes. “As well as challenging partial deductions, we are also warning senior management that withholding 100% of pay is tantamount to a lock out and that staff will be within their rights to respond by calling more strike action.”",News/UK news,UK university dispute escalates over plan to dock staff pay,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/10/uk-university-strike-dispute-escalates-over-plan-to-dock-staff-pay
2/11/2022,"The chief executive of Ben & Jerry’s parent company, Unilever, has criticised the ice-cream maker’s controversial tweet about the Ukraine crisis, saying it should stay away from issues where it does not have “expertise or credibility”. The ice-cream company, which drew fire with a decision to stop selling its products in occupied Palestinian territories last year, caused a social media storm on Friday by calling on Biden to not send more troops to Europe, saying he risked “fanning the flames of war”.  Unilever boss Alan Jope was asked about the company’s reaction to the tweet during a press call about his company’s annual results on Thursday. The consumer goods giant acquired Ben & Jerry’s more than 20 years ago in a move that many predicted would dilute the counter-culture ethos of a company founded in 1970s San Francisco. But the ice-cream maker has continued to speak out on issues such as equality and the climate crisis. “It is a great brand, most of the time they get it right,” said Jope. “They have a great track record campaigning on important issues. But [on] subjects where Unilever brands don’t have expertise or credibility it is best to stay out of the debate.” You cannot simultaneously prevent and prepare for war. ⁰⁰We call on President Biden to de-escalate tensions and work for peace rather than prepare for war. ⁰⁰Sending thousands more US troops to Europe in response to Russia’s threats against Ukraine only fans the flame of war. Jope pointed out that the views held by subsidiaries are not those of the company. Unilever is unable to muzzle Ben & Jerry’s, as under the terms of its takeover in 2000 the ice-cream company has its own independent board of directors free to take their own political stance. The company’s decision to stop selling ice-cream in occupied Palestinian territories last summer was highlighted by the leading Unilever shareholder, Terry Smith, the founder of Fundsmith, as the most obvious example of what he feels is Unilever’s obsession with public image and building environmental, social and governance credentials over business performance. Jope said that Ben & Jerry’s showed strong 9% growth last year, becoming one of 13 Unilever brands to be worth 1bn-plus euros, and said that a new sales “arrangement” in Israel would come into force in 2023. He said that the Twitter posts on Israel and Ukraine were not responsible for driving ice-cream sales. “I definitely would not make a connection between those statements and sales growth,” he said. “Growth is driven much more by innovation.” Ben & Jerry’s will end sales of our ice cream in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Read our full statement: https://t.co/2mGWYGN4GA pic.twitter.com/kFeu7aXOf3 Jope also reiterated that he believes the company is on the right track in pushing sustainability and purpose across its 400 brand portfolio. “Our brands that have sustainability as part of their proposition are growing faster,” he said. “I still believe it will be absolutely critical for successful businesses of the future. It is the icing on the cake, not the cake [itself]. It comes on top of getting the basics right.” Calls from investors to consider splitting the business, and a restructure of Unilever’s business units, has raised questions of a potential sale of operations including its ice-cream and nutrition businesses. “Both are great businesses,” said Jope. “They have some of the strongest brands that can thrive within Unilever. I see a bright future ahead for both the nutrition and ice-cream businesses inside Unilever.”",News/Business,Ben & Jerry’s Ukraine tweet gets frosty reception from Unilever boss,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/10/ben-jerrys-ukraine-tweet-gets-frosty-reception-from-unilever-boss
2/11/2022,"The board of the children’s charity Kids Company founded by Camila Batmanghelidjh has been criticised by the charities watchdog for failing to properly oversee the charity – a year after she and her trustees were comprehensively exonerated of mismanagement by the high court. The long-awaited Charity Commission report made a formal finding of “mismanagement in the administration of the charity” and of operating a “high-risk business model”. It raised questions whether thousands of pounds spent by the charity on a small group of high-risk child clients was justified.  However, it said there was no basis for regulatory action against Batmanghelidjh or the trustees, and confirmed there was “no dishonesty, bad faith, or inappropriate gain in the operation of the charity”. Many of the report findings were immediately contested by Batmanghelidjh, who threatened a legal challenge to overturn what she called a “travesty” of a report and an attempt by the Charity Commission to “rewrite history”. The former trustees said they were disappointed the report had ignored a judge’s findings. The prospect of a further legal challenge raises the possibility that the long-running saga has further to run; it is nearly seven years since the charity closed, consuming millions in legal costs, thousands of media articles and hundreds of hours of parliamentary and Whitehall time. Before its closure in 2015 amid allegations of financial mismanagement and child abuse, Kids Company was well known for its high-profile work providing practical and emotional support for children affected by trauma, violence and poverty. Its supporters included Coldplay and David Cameron. The commission highlighted in the report published on Thursday shortcomings at Kids Company in a number of areas, from record-keeping to maintaining financial reserves, and failing to act quickly enough to improve the charity’s financial stability. Helen Stephenson, chief executive of the Charity Commission, said Kids Company’s sudden closure was a “significant event”, not just for those involved in and supported by the charity, but for wider society and highlighted a period of sharper scrutiny of those running charities by the media and parliament. She said: “We found that the charity’s operations and finances made the charity – and by extension its beneficiaries – more vulnerable to decisions of individual grant-makers and donors. The charity’s repeated failure to pay creditors, including its own workers and HMRC, on time, was mismanagement.” It was noticeably less critical of the charity than a 2016 MPs’ report which accused the charity of recklessness, negligence and improper spending. Batmanghelidjh and the trustees said the report was based on untruths and allegations that had been comprehensively dismissed by a court ruling more than a year ago, which found no evidence of mismanagement or wrongdoing, and praised them as a “group of highly impressive and dedicated individuals”. Batmanghelidjh said: “Its report is a travesty. It ignores clear evidence that has been submitted and it amounts to nothing more than a corrupted attempt by the Charity Commission to justify its mistaken decision to conduct an investigation in the first place. Its processes lack any rigour and are riddled with unfairness.” She added: “The report is an attempt to rewrite history. It presumptuously undermines the painstaking findings of the high court which found that neither I nor the trustees of Kids Company had committed any wrongdoing.” A statement by the former Kids Company trustees said the judge’s “findings as to the selflessness, skill, care and commitment shown by the trustees, made clear that there was no basis for concluding that there was mismanagement in the conduct of the charity’s affairs. We reject the commission’s finding to the contrary.” The trustees said the commission, by largely discounting the findings of the court that they had acted appropriately and with dedication in “exercising honest judgment in difficult circumstances”, would discourage other people from volunteering as charity trustees in future. The commission inquiry opened in August 2015, a fortnight after Kids Company went into voluntary liquidation after allegations of child abuse on sites owned by the charity. A six-month investigation by the Metropolitan police found no evidence of abuse, criminality or safeguarding failures. The court concluded the charity would have survived had it not been for the unfounded abuse allegations. Batmanghelidjh and the trustees became the target of relentless attacks in some sections of the media, including allegations it misspent charity funds providing clothes, healthcare and housing support for some of its child clients. A cross-party group of MPs accused the trustees of mismanaging the charity. In 2017, the official receiver launched legal proceedings to try to ban Batmanghelidjh and seven trustees from holding senior board roles in companies or charities, culminating in a 10-week court case in autumn 2020, and the judge’s ruling a year ago. The failed attempt cost the taxpayer £9.5m in legal costs. The commission inquiry – addressing the allegations of financial mismanagement and governance failure made at the time of the charity’s closure in 2015 and whether they “are found to be true” – was put on hold until after the court case was completed, and has taken a year to reach its conclusions. These include: The charity operated a high-risk business model, over-expanded its operations too rapidly, failed to strengthen its cashflow and failed to pay creditors and HMRC on time. It said the board was skilled but lacked specialist expertise in the field of psychotherapy. There was insufficient evidence to be sure that the charity’s expenditure of an average of £1,700 a month on a group of 25 high-needs children was justified. The trustees had the right to make these decisions, it said, but argued it could have helped more children had it reduced this spending. The charity’s reporting of the numbers of children who received its services could have been more transparent, it said. But it reported no evidence to back up allegations, made by an MPs’ committee, that Kids Company had overinflated its claim that it served 36,000 beneficiaries.",News/UK news,Kids Company criticised for failures by watchdog year after exoneration,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/10/kids-company-criticised-for-failures-by-watchdog-year-after-exoneration
2/11/2022,"Sitting in a cafe in an upmarket Moscow suburb, the former mercenary Marat Gabidullin looked a long way from the battlefields of Syria where he fought half a decade ago. Gripping his recently finished memoir, In the Same River Twice, the first published account of fighting for the secretive Russian mercenary outfit Wagner, Gabidullin said: “I wrote this because I realised it’s time for our country to face the truth: mercenaries exist.”  At 55, he’s an imposing figure, with his face and muscular arms covered in scars. “We, in Russia, prefer not to discuss our mercenaries,” he added. “It doesn’t fit the official narrative.” In 2015, Gabidullin, a Russian airborne forces veteran and former bodyguard, joined Wagner, at the time a relatively unknown mercenary group. He was soon deployed to fight in Syria alongside the Russian army supporting President Bashar al-Assad, quickly rising to command one of Wagner’s five units there. Established in 2014 to support pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, Wagner is allegedly funded by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a powerful businessman closely linked to Vladimir Putin who has faced western sanctions. From the company’s inception, it has been shrouded in mystery. On paper, the firm does not exist, with no company registration, tax returns or organisational chart to be found. Western governments and academics argue that Wagner is an unofficial foreign policy tool of the Kremlin, deployed where Russia wants to extend its influence or create upheaval. Prigozhin and Moscow have denied any knowledge of Wagner; officially, private military companies remain illegal in Russia. Representatives for Prigozhin have not responded to requests for comment. Gabidullin made no attempt to deny Wagner’s existence or its active role in Russian security interests. In contrast, he said one of his main motivations behind writing the book was to bring mercenary companies such as Wagner “out of the shadow”, highlighting their potential benefits for Russia’s foreign policy goals. “Mercenary groups are nothing to be ashamed of, they exist everywhere, but we lie about them,” he said. “We have specialised skills that a normal army lacks.” The memoir, based on events Gabidullin claims he witnessed, follows three years of Wagner’s Syrian campaign. It describes some of the mercenaries’ big battles, including two operations to liberate the ancient city of Palmyra. Scores of Wagner soldiers are believed to have fought and died in Syria since the conflict began in 2011. “The Russian army’s achievements in Syria were largely because of the mercenaries’ sacrifices. That fact is completely ignored by the military establishment and not known to the wider public,” Gabidullin complained, grumbling that “mediocre” Russian army generals received promotions based on Wagner’s successes. The memoir also describes mercenaries’ day-to-day lives, including occasional looting, and his commanders’ missteps. Gabidullin, whose hearing has suffered after years of fighting, also said he participated in the 2018 Battle of Khasham, where hundreds of Russian mercenaries were reportedly killed after US airstrikes against pro-regime forces, in what is believed to be the deadliest clash between Russia and the US since the cold war. “We should never have been there; our leadership messed up. The Americans knew exactly where we were,” he said, recalling those events. Post-Syria, Wagner’s notoriety has increased after reported operations in Central African Republic and Libya – resource-rich countries in which Russia has strategic interests. The group’s growing influence has also divided Mali and its European partners after the west African nation deployed Wagner fighters in December. And as tensions have escalated over Ukraine in recent months, Reuters reported that unnamed Russian mercenaries have been sent to separatist-controlled eastern Ukraine. Last week, the US-based Daily Beast claimed that Wagner soldiers are being moved from Africa, possibly towards Ukraine. Gabidullin said he had “vaguely heard” of mercenary deployments in Ukraine, quickly adding that a Russian invasion would be a “fatal” mistake. “I believe that war between Ukraine and Russia will be a complete disaster for Russia. Under no circumstances should this be allowed. Ukraine is our brother.” Throughout the conversation, Gabidullin looked somewhat agitated, his piercing blue eyes darting around the empty cafe. He said he worried about the consequences of publishing his book and was eager to avoid mentioning his alleged former boss, Prigozhin. “I suspect that there will be attempts by [Prigozhin] to discredit me. I am walking on a tightrope here,” he said. He first wanted to publish the memoir in 2020 but quickly withdrew his book after pressure from “certain people”. This time, however, he decided to not hold back and found a “brave” publisher in the city of Ekaterinburg. The Paris-based Michel Lafon publishing house is also planning to distribute a French version. “I thought to myself, ‘Enough, it’s time to get out of the shadows.’ I will not be dissuaded from publishing again. Because it is not just about me,” said Gabidullin. He pointed to how the ban on private military companies in Russia pressures family members of deceased mercenaries to remain quiet about their loved ones. Gabidullin hopes his book will help lift the veil of secrecy around his former profession. “This current situation does not suit many of my comrades. More importantly, it does not suit the dead mercenaries’ parents and relatives, who cannot even talk openly about how their son or brother died. They can only whisper it.” While Gabidullin’s memoir challenges the official narrative regarding the existence of mercenaries in Russia, a separate PR campaign also sprung up last year to promote the activities of groups like Wagner. Russian state television recently screened numerous patriotic action movies produced by Prigozhin-linked firms, depicting unnamed Russian “military instructors and volunteers” fighting in eastern Ukraine, Central African Republic and Mozambique – places where Wagner fighters have reportedly been active. The films, which Gabidullin dismissed as “trash”, portray heroic Russians saving local people from violent rebels. They stand in stark contrast to recent UN reports accusing Wagner operatives of raping civilians in Central African Republic or allegations that Wagner soldiers tortured and killed a prisoner in Syria. Confronted with these accusations, Gabidullin said he never saw his comrades engaged in such acts but added that such crimes were to be expected given the group’s current shadowy status. “The state puts mercenaries in a situation where they can act outside the law, and a soldier is forced to establish his own moral norms. But, of course, we should investigate that messed-up stuff.”",News/World news,‘Mercenaries have skills armies lack’: former Wagner operative opens up,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/10/marat-gabidullin-russian-mercenary-wagner
2/11/2022,"“The Republican party is having a bit of an internal squabble right now,” said Jimmy Kimmel on Wednesday evening. “The party is divided over whether the violent insurrection of January 6 was a violent insurrection or just a lively sightseeing tour of the Capitol.”  A week ago, the Republican National Committee voted to censure GOP legislators Adam Kinzinger and Liz Cheney for participating in the House inquiry into the insurrection, and in a statement called the attack “ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse”. “They’re just a group of ordinary citizens wearing bear skin and horns smearing feces on the wall of the Capitol,” Kimmel laughed. “Just ordinary citizens.” In a rebuke of his own party, the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, reaffirmed this week that the attack was “a violent insurrection” aimed at preventing the peaceful transfer of power. “Just to show you how far down the crazy hole we’ve gone, we’re now applauding Republicans who are willing to admit that what happened, happened,” Kimmel noted. “But there’s not just crazy, there’s some dumb going on, too,” he continued, pointing to deranged comments this week by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. Greene likened Congress to a gulag and said Nancy Pelosi deployed “gazpacho police”, instead of the Gestapo. “If you’ve got cold soup you’d better watch it, because Nancy Pelosi is coming for it,” said Kimmel. “These must be the soup Nazis Seinfeld warned us about so many years ago. And if the gazpacho police get ahold of you they’ll throw you right in the goulash.” Highways across the country have been separating Black and white neighborhoods at all costs since the 1950’s… even if it meant making zig zag lines like a racist Mario Kart. pic.twitter.com/LPteLsVG9x On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah looked into the racist foundations of America’s highway system, which Biden’s Build Back Better infrastructure plan seeks to address. “What you may not know is that when America first started building its highway system back in the 1950s, people were often forced to leave their homes to make room for all these fancy new roads,” Noah explained. “And guess which people were moved the most.” The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, one of the largest and most consequential infrastructure measures in American history, added 41,000 miles to the interstate system and cut through almost every major American city, displacing predominantly black and brown residents. The construction of I-94 in St Paul, Minnesota, for example, displaced one in seven of the city’s black residents. “Highway I-94 could’ve been anywhere in Minnesota, but it just happened to displace the very few black people living in Minnesota, more commonly known as the Minnesota Timberwolves,” Noah noted. “And look, don’t get me wrong: these highways had to go somewhere. I’m not saying no highways. But more often than not, that somewhere was right through a black neighborhood. “Black people are used to being displaced by gentrification, even today, but at least when that happens, they get to enjoy Shake Shack for a few months first,” he added. “These highways, on the other hand, they didn’t provide any improvement to the neighborhood. They slashed a hole through it. And whatever was left of that neighborhood just withered and died.” Highway construction not only displaced residents and permanently shut down black businesses, they also reinforced segregation at a time when new laws demanded the integration of schools. Highways in Atlanta, for example, “were laid down primarily with regard to keeping the races apart rather than keeping traffic moving efficiently”, said Professor Kevin Kruse of Princeton University. The city’s snarling traffic is in part due to design which winds around the city to cordon off black neighborhoods, rather than move cars. “Man, racism is a helluva drug,” said Noah. “Instead of designing the most efficient highway, they instead made it zigzag around the city like some kind of racist Mariokart. “Highways might not be following black people around department stores or turning them down for loans,” he concluded, “but the way that highways were built in America was inarguably racist.”",Arts/Culture,"Jimmy Kimmel: ‘We’re applauding Republicans willing to admit that what happened, happened’",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/10/jimmy-kimmel-capitol-insurrection-trevor-noah
2/11/2022,"The directors of a British firm producing tropical fish-themed coins for the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) are being threatened with prosecution by Mauritius as the net tightens around the UK’s claim to sovereignty over the Chagos Islands. The family-owned Pobjoy Mint, based in Kingswood, Surrey, has received a formal letter from Mauritius’s attorney general, Maneesh Gobin, telling its owners they are violating international law by manufacturing the currency without the correct legal permission.  The colourful coins, dated 2021, display native aquatic species and bear the Queen’s head on the obverse. They are legal tender on BIOT, struck under licence from the UK government. One of the 50p pieces features an orange and white Chagos anemonefish - as popularised in the film Finding Nemo. The problem for the mint is that the United Nations’ highest court, the international court of justice, ruled in 2019 that the UK unlawfully detached the Chagos Islands from Mauritius before it gained its independence, and must return them. The Mauritian attorney general’s letter points out that the “issuing of currency is … an exercise of sovereign rights”. By doing so for BIOT, it states, the mint is “assisting in a serious violation of international law” and breaching the criminal code of Mauritius. The maximum penalties for such an offence in Mauritius are fines of up to 5 million rupees (£84,000) and a prison term “not exceeding 10 years”. There is no extradition treaty between the UK and Mauritius. The Pobjoy Mint has been contacted for comment. The legal move comes after a similar initiative by Mauritus at the UN’s Universal Postal Union last year. The UPU recognised the validity of international court rulings against the UK and recommended that its 192 member countries “cease the registration, distribution and forwarding of any and all postage stamps issued by the territory formerly known as the ‘British Indian Ocean Territory’”. As well as providing decorations for coins, the abundant natural life in the surrounding seas could bring great potential riches for the islands through either eco-tourism or intensive commercial fishing. In 2010, the UK government created a marine protected area (MPA) around the archipelago banning all catches. The Mauritian government is drafting a similar MPA regulation for when it eventually takes control of BIOT. It is expected to permit returned Chagossians to take fish for their own subsistence. This week’s expedition by the Bleu De Nîmes, a converted former British minesweeper, is the first organised by Mauritius into the waters of the disputed archipelago. Among the Chagossians on board was Marcel Humbert, 66. He is accompanying the survey to show Mauritian officials and scientists examining the outlying Blenheim Reef where Chagossians historically fished in their outrigger sailing canoes. “We used to catch red snapper, tuna, sharks, parrot fish and kingfish,” he explained. “But always with hooks – not nets. I would love to go back and fish in the Chagos Islands. We had a great knowledge of the sea.” One crustacean with alarming, predatory capabilities is the metre-wide coconut or robber crab. It has become dominant on some islands since the Chagossians were deported and has been observed hunting and killing seabirds. “You have to be careful,” Marcel added. “Their claws are very powerful. They can cut coconuts in two.” Traditionally, land crabs were cooked in coconut milk. The oldest surviving Chagossian, now 100 and living in Mauritius, has asked for one to be brought back so she can taste the dish one last time before she dies.",News/World news,Mauritius warns UK firm over coins amid Chagos Islands dispute,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/10/mauritius-warns-uk-firm-over-coins-amid-chagos-islands-dispute
2/11/2022,"Hello and Happy Thursday, A few days ago, the US supreme court made a decision in a significant voting rights case that I find unusual and alarming.  In an emergency 5-4 ruling on Monday, the court said Alabama did not have to redraw its seven congressional districts ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. This halted a decision from just weeks previously, when a three-judge panel issued an extensive ruling telling Alabama that it did in fact need to redraw the districts because they discriminated against Black people. African Americans comprise roughly a quarter of Alabama’s voting age population, but held a majority in just one of the state’s seven districts. The panel told Alabama its new plan had to have at least two districts where Black Alabamians made up a majority or near majority. The speed with which that lower court acted caught my attention, because the decision was based on Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act (which prohibits voting discrimination based on race) – and Section 2 redistricting cases are notoriously complex and can take years to wind through the court. But the judges said the question was not a close one, and other redistricting experts agreed. “Pretty much a textbook Section 2 case,” Nicholas Stephanopoulos, a law professor at Harvard tweeted. “If this doesn’t violate Section 2, nothing does.” In short, this was a textbook example of the use of section 2 of the Voting Rights Act if there ever was one. This isn’t even close. The fact that SCOTUS took the case is ominous, plain and simple. We only have a glimpse into why the US supreme court reversed the lower court ruling. The court issued its decision on its “shadow docket” – an emergency docket in which the justices don’t have to explain their reasoning. In this case, justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, and Amy Coney Barrett offered no explanation of their thinking. The insight we do have comes from justices Brett Kavanaugh and Samuel Alito. Writing for the pair, Kavanaugh said the case actually was “not clearcut in favor of the plaintiffs”. Requiring Alabama to redraw its districts now, he said, would result in confusion for voters and hardship for the state as it prepared for elections this year. It’s hard to take that argument seriously. Alabama’s primary election is not until May 24, with mail-in ballot deadlines at the end of March. The state legislature completed the redistricting process in less than a week. Surely the state could put a new map in place with plenty of time ahead of the primary. Kavanaugh’s decision essentially tells states that even if their map is eventually found to be illegal, they can get a free pass to use it for one election. The plaintiffs in the Alabama case moved just about as quickly as they could in the case. They filed their case immediately after the maps went into effect and the lower court expedited the trial to issue a ruling four months ahead of the primary. I struggle to imagine a scenario in which they could have moved faster. Chief Justice John Roberts did not join Kavanaugh and Alito, but issued his own cryptic statement. He said that he would have required Alabama to redraw its maps, but said the law needed clarification. Many observers took that as a worrisome sign. In 2013 when the supreme court gutted a core piece of the Voting Rights Act, the section was one of the ways voting rights plaintiffs could challenge discriminatory laws. Now, Roberts is signaling he is open to narrowing the law. After the ruling, I wanted to better understand what the lack of representation would mean for Black voters in Alabama. I posed that question to Steven Reed, the mayor of Montgomery, Alabama. He pointed to the fact that all six Republicans in Alabama’s congressional delegation voted against a sweeping voting rights bill in congress. The makeup of the congressional delegation also made it more difficult to advocate for expanding health care. “When you look at other disparities in the healthcare realm, that is a need that our congressional delegation has not supported,” said Reed, a Democrat and Montgomery’s first Black mayor. “Had our congressional delegation been more diverse and had another advocate that represents the Black population, it would have had a different effect.” Sheila Tyson, a Democratic county commissioner in Jefferson county, pointed to Republican opposition to raising the minimum wage and paid leave. “We don’t have people in these seats that represent us, that’s going to represent our beliefs.”",News/US news,The supreme court’s alarming emergency ruling on Alabama’s maps,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/10/the-supreme-courts-alarming-emergency-ruling-on-alabamas-maps
2/11/2022,"Several outstanding recordings have opened up the world of Grażyna Bacewicz’s string music recently. Now Peter Jablonski adds to the momentum behind her piano music. Bacewicz was not only a renowned violinist, she was no mean pianist either – and, as with the violin, her writing for the piano is exhilarating and absolutely fitted to the instrument. In Jablonski’s selection, these qualities come across most obviously in the Ten Concert Etudes, written in 1956-67. These, especially the earliest ones of the set, take an irresistible joy in the mechanics of the piano, in the action of hammers hitting strings – they’ll appeal to fans of Kurtág, and to those who love the similarly playful Etudes by Ligeti, written three decades later. Mismatched scales and arpeggios dance up and down the keyboard, and a motoric energy underpins even the more sweeping, lyrical numbers.  By the time she wrote these – and the contrasting Two Etudes on Double Notes, which Jablonski plays with a light touch and considerable charm – Bacewicz had survived a serious car accident that ended her performing career. But in 1953 she had been able to give the premiere of her own Piano Sonata No 2, a deceptively compact three-movement work that begins in expansive yet mercurial mood, ends with a big, restless toccata and centres on a slow movement built from a hypnotic, swaying figure – Jablonski makes this music sound magical when it returns at the end of the movement. Often, such as in that finale, the rhythms of Polish folk dance are in the background of Bacewicz’s writing; sometimes they are nearer the forefront, as in the brief, cheery Concert Krakowiak, based on snippets of folk melody. Her Piano Sonata No 1, written in 1949, was published only last year, in an edition by Jablonski himself. Catching its play between high and low sonorities in the early movements and the tricksy rhythms of its finale, he is as persuasive a performer of it as he is of everything else here. Regards de Femmes from the pianist Marie-Catherine Girod (Mirare) is a nicely put-together whistle-stop survey of 17 composers. Some might already be on your radar – such as Ethel Smyth, represented gratifyingly by her Variations on an Original Theme (of an Exceedingly Dismal Nature) – but there are discoveries to be made too, including a lovely miniature by Norway’s Agathe Backer Grøndahl, two Provence-inspired pieces by Jeanne Barbillion and a minuet by Mozart’s British contemporary Maria Hester Park.",Arts/Music,Grażyna Bacewicz: Piano Music review – irresistibly joyful tunes dance on the keyboard,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/10/grazyna-bacewicz-piano-music-review-peter-jablonski-joyful-tunes
2/11/2022,"Our democracy has always been among the strongest and most settled in the world. It relies on respect for the laws made in parliament, on an independent judiciary, on acceptance of the conventions of public life, and on self-restraint by the powerful. If any of that delicate balance goes astray – as it has, as it is – our democracy is undermined. Our government is culpable, in small but important ways, of failing to honour these conventions.  Where governments fall short, candour is the best means of shoring up support. But that candour must be freely offered – not dragged out under the searchlight of inquiries. If it is not wholehearted and convincing, the loss of public trust can be swift and unforgiving. We have seen that playing out in recent weeks. Trust in politics is at a low ebb, eroded by foolish behaviour, leaving a sense of unease about how our politics is being conducted. Too often, ministers have been evasive and the truth has been optional. When they respond to legitimate questions with pre-prepared soundbites, or half-truths, or misdirection, or wild exaggeration, then respect for government and politics dies a little more. Misleading replies to questions invite disillusion. Outright lies breed contempt. In our democracy, we are able to speak truth to power. But, if democracy is to be respected, power must also speak truth to the people. And yet, in recent years, it has not been doing so. There has been cynicism about politics from the dawn of time. We are told that politicians are “all the same”, and this untruth conditions electors to condone lies as though they were the accepted currency of public life. But politicians are not “all the same”. And lies are just not acceptable. To imply otherwise is to cheapen public life, and slander the vast majority of elected politicians, who do not knowingly mislead. But some do – and their behaviour is corrosive. This tarnishes both politics and the reputation of parliament. It is a dangerous trend. If lies become commonplace, truth ceases to exist. What and whom, then, can we believe? The risk is … nothing and no one. And where are we then? Parliament is an echo chamber. Lies can become accepted as fact, which – as the Speaker has pointed out – has consequences for policy and for reputation. That is why deliberate lies to parliament have been fatal to political careers, and must always be so. If trust in the word of our leaders in parliament is lost, trust in government will be lost too. At No 10, the prime minister and officials broke lockdown laws. Brazen excuses were dreamed up. Day after day, the public was asked to believe the unbelievable. Ministers were sent out to defend the indefensible – making themselves look either gullible or foolish. Collectively, this has made the government look distinctly shifty, which has consequences that go far beyond political unpopularity. The lack of trust in the elected portion of our democracy cannot be brushed aside. Parliament has a duty to correct this. If it does not, and trust is lost at home, our politics is broken. If trust in our word is lost overseas, we may no longer be able to work effectively with friends and partners for mutual benefit – or even security. Unfortunately, that trust is being lost, and our reputation overseas has fallen because of our conduct. We are weakening our influence in the world. We should be wary. Even a casual glance at overseas opinion shows our reputation is being shredded. A nation that loses friends and allies becomes a weaker nation. And when ministers attack or blame foreign governments to gain populist support at home, we are not taken seriously. Megaphone diplomacy merely increases hostility overseas. International trust may not be easy to regain. Our way of life is built around the maintenance of law. It was unprecedented when this government broke the law by proroguing parliament, to avoid debates on Brexit that might not have gone as they wished. I had promised, in a BBC interview, that if the government attempted to muzzle parliament I would challenge their action in court. So I did, though not as swiftly as the civil rights campaigner Gina Miller. Both our challenges were upheld unanimously by the supreme court, which ruled that the government’s actions were unlawful. The prime minister said he “disagreed” with the court, and the then leader of the house accused the supreme court judges of “a constitutional coup”. The government accepted the verdict, but in bad faith. It did not apologise – nor did it mend its ways. It went on to introduce legislation giving the government the power to break international law, albeit – as one minister conceded – “in a limited but specific way”. Fortunately, the issue fell away, but it was a proposal that should never have been put forward. It cut overseas aid – which parliament had set at 0.7% of GDP – without the prior approval of parliament (although this was obtained retrospectively). And this is the government that fought a referendum to “protect the sovereignty of parliament” and the sanctity of domestic law. All of this is against the backdrop of the prime minister being investigated for several apparent breaches of the ministerial code. He chose to ignore critical reports on his ministers; rejected advice from his independent adviser on ministerial standards, who resigned; and attempted but failed to overturn a unanimous standards select committee report that condemned the behaviour of a parliamentary colleague and friend. It may be possible to find excuses for each of these lapses – and others – but all of them, taken together, tell a different tale. There have also been attempted assaults on civil rights, not all of them successful. The government briefed, but rowed back from, a serious attack on judicial review: but the intent was there and may return. It proposed legislation to allow the police to “stop and search” anyone at a protest meeting “without any cause for suspicion”. It attempted to legislate to allow the police to impose conditions on protest marches likely to be “noisy”. These are not the only examples. If the power of the state grows and the protections of the law diminish, the liberties of the individual fall. The mother of parliaments should not permit this. We British are a kindly people. When appeals are made for those in distress – at home or abroad – the good heart of our nation responds with compassion and generosity. But increasingly across the western world, populist pressure leads governments to be less generous to refugees, asylum seekers and migrants. Here in the UK, the government wishes to remove British citizenship from dual nationals, without any notice or right of appeal. It proposes serious action against criminal gangs that traffic migrants – and rightly so. But it also proposes to criminalise the migrants themselves. We should search our souls before doing this. Can it really be a crime to be frightened, homeless, desperate, destitute, fleeing from persecution or war or famine or hardship – and to cross half the world on foot and dangerous waters in an unsafe boat in the hope of finding a better life? Of course, if the numbers are too large, this creates an appalling problem for local communities. But surely, to seek sanctuary from an unbearable life cannot – morally – be treated as a crime. Yet the government’s borders bill proposes to punish asylum seekers who take an unsanctioned route with a jail sentence of up to four years. These proposals are not natural justice, and are decidedly un-British. I hope the government will reconsider. The style of the government creates its own problems. It looks for enemies where there are none. Moreover, it then chooses the wrong enemies. Most recently, it has been waging campaigns against the civil service and the BBC. In neither case is this wise or justified – or even in the government’s own interests. The civil service is the support structure to government: treating it as a hostile “blob” that seeks to undermine the government is both foolish and wrong. As for the BBC, it is a crucial part of our overseas “soft power”, and a policy of undermining it and starving it of funds is self-defeating for UK interests. Ministers should remember that both these institutions are more trusted than the government itself. They should focus their attention on reforms to improve public life. It is time to refocus on how our politics is funded. The system needs cleansing. It must never be the plaything of the rich or of pressure groups, yet no one wants our politics fully funded by the state. Certainly, I don’t. Legislation should limit funding by individuals, by companies, by trades unions, to sums that no one can reasonably claim would entitle the donor to favours, rewards or undesirable access. Donors must not be seen to sway policy through an open chequebook. For many years, travelling the world, I have been received as the lucky representative of the most stable democracy of them all. It was a position of influence built up over centuries – envied, praised and copied. Trust matters. It matters to our parliament. It matters to our country. It matters for the long-term protection and wellbeing of democracy. John Major was the prime minister of Britain from 1990 to 1997.

2/11/2022,"The European parliament is preparing to launch a committee of inquiry into the Pegasus spyware scandal after evidence emerged of government critics in Poland and Hungary being targeted with the surveillance software. The cross-party body will seek testimony from member states’ intelligence services, elected politicians and senior officials, with a previous inquiry into alleged European facilitation of CIA “black sites” providing a model.  The move is the most significant yet from Brussels since a group of media organisations including the Guardian revealed that Pegasus software was being used against journalists, activists and politicians in numerous countries across the world including in Europe. It follows the announcement from the Israeli government earlier this week that it would investigate reports of Israeli policeusing Pegasus against its own citizens. Local media reports claimed the list of targets included people involved in the corruption trial of the former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Pegasus allows an operator to take control of a target’s mobile device, access all data even from encrypted messaging apps and turn on audio or video recording. The investigation by the Guardian and 16 other media organisations had been based on forensic analysis of phones and a leaked database of 50,000 numbers, including that of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, the European Council president, Charles Michel, and other heads of state and senior government, diplomatic and military officials in 34 countries. The Israeli company that manufactures the software, NSO Group, has previously said the figure of 50,000 was “exaggerated” and that the list could not be a list of numbers “targeted by governments using Pegasus”. The analysis of phones in Europe showed that journalists, activists and lawyers in Hungary had been targeted with Pegasus. A senior Hungarian government official appeared to confirm in November that the software had been purchased by the state, but it was later denied and ministers have since declined to comment. Hungarian journalists are planning to take legal action against the state and NSO. In Poland, a senate commission saw documents in January that suggested that country’s Central Anti-Corruption Bureau (CBA) had bought Pegasus in 2017 using funds from the justice ministry. Law and Justice, the lead party in the governing coalition, has boycotted the commission in the opposition-led senate. The European parliament has only launched a committee on inquiry on a handful of occasions, and the proposal has already received the required political backing of a quarter of MEPs and the endorsement of the heads of political groups. It has been pushed by the Renew Europe political group in the parliament in which Macron’s La République En Marche MEPs sit, and is expected to be formally approved in a plenary session in Strasbourg next week. Assuming that happens, the committee is expected to sit for 12 months from April, during which it will hold public sessions and call for relevant documents and oral and written testimony. NSO Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the inquiry, but in previous answers to the Guardian it has said it could not confirm or deny whether particular countries were clients. It also insisted its tools were only meant for use against criminals and terrorists, and should not be used on dissidents, activists or journalists. The president of the Renew Europe group, Stéphane Séjourné, said: “The Pegasus scandal is not just an assault on individual freedoms. It is an attack by autocratic regimes on the essence of our European democracies. “When software developed to target terrorists is used against opposition politicians by European governments, this is very serious indeed. “The scale of the allegations show why we need a European response and this is why we have led calls for the European Parliament to launch an inquiry committee with teeth, that can consult experts and call witnesses from across Europe.” Once the committee has completed its investigation it will file a report for national governments and the European Commission. “Nothing should be off the table and no stone should be left unturned,” Séjourné said. “We don’t just want information about the scale of the scandal, we want recommendations put on the table of the European Commission and national governments, so this can never happen again.” The EU’s justice commissioner, Didier Reynders, told MEPs in September that the European Commission “totally condemned” alleged attempts by national security services to illegally access information on political opponents through their phones. He said it was already the case, as confirmed by the European court of justice, that governments could not “restrict the confidentiality and integrity of communications” except in “very strictly limited” scenarios. He also said a pending EU privacy regulation would tighten the rules further, and called for MEPs and member states to urgently agree on the details of the new law in light of the spyware scandal.",News/News,EU close to launching committee of inquiry into Pegasus spyware,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/10/eu-close-to-launching-committee-of-inquiry-into-pegasus-spyware
2/11/2022,"Downing Street has pledged to reveal if Boris Johnson is fined by police for attending any parties while Covid restrictions were in force, but the prime minister refused to rule out staying on even he is found to have broken the law. It comes after Scotland Yard announced officers were sending a questionnaire to more than 50 people believed to have attended social events in Downing Street and Whitehall despite the curbs on gatherings.  Johnson has managed to so far avoid a wave of anger among his own MPs reaching the threshold at which a no-confidence vote is called, but some backbenchers are still waiting for the outcome of the Met’s inquiry to decide whether to try to oust him. There are 54 letters of no confidence needed for a ballot to be triggered, but Johnson’s opponents want to ensure that they would then win the subsequent vote by getting 181 colleagues to vote against him. With the Commons about to go into recess for 10 days, Johnson’s spokesperson said on Thursday that he had not yet received an official communication from Scotland Yard. Asked if Downing Street would say if Johnson got a £100 fixed penalty notice, he confirmed: “We would look to confirm contact of this as relates to the prime minister given the significant public interest.” Pressed on whether Johnson considered deliberately misleading parliament to be a resigning matter, the spokesperson said: “That is an element of the ministerial code and the prime minister fully supports that.” Johnson himself refused to say whether he would resign as prime minister if he was fined by the police for breaking the law. Speaking at a press conference during a trip to Nato headquarters in Brussels, Johnson said the Met police probe “must be completed and I’m looking forward to it being completed and that’s the time to say more on that”. Asked again if he would quit or try to stay on, the prime minister repeated: “I understand, but we’re going to wait for the process to be completed.” Despite some MPs’ concerns Scotland Yard’s inquiry could drag on, the Met commissioner, Cressida Dick, confirmed questionnaires were being sent out to people believed to have been at some of the dozen events under investigation. “Some but probably not all may very well end up with a fixed penalty notice,” she told BBC Radio London. Dick added many people had been left “hugely disgusted” by reports of the parties, and suggested part of the investigation – known as Operation Hillman – involved speaking to officers who were on duty in Downing Street at the time. “It would be quite wrong for me to comment on whether anyone who works for the Met did or did not know what you describe as what’s going on, because that is part of the investigation,” she said. The Guardian revealed last week that civil servants who had given evidence to the official civil service inquiry run by Sue Gray were told the government may never know who was fined for attending parties across Whitehall in breach of Covid rules. Johnson was defended by his attorney general, Suella Braverman, in the Commons on Monday. Asked by Labour MP Rupa Huq if breaches of the ministerial code would lead to resignations, Braverman said: “I would just say that fundamental to the rule of law is also democracy. And I’m very proud to be supporting this prime minister – a prime minister who has honoured democracy by delivering Brexit.”",News/Politics,No 10 to reveal if Boris Johnson is fined over parties – but PM won’t say if he’d quit,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/10/no-10-to-reveal-if-boris-johnson-is-fined-over-parties-but-pm-wont-say-if-hed-quit
2/11/2022,"Sting has sold his back catalogue, featuring hits including Roxanne, Every Breath You Take and Englishman in New York, to Universal Music in a deal thought to be worth up to $300m (£221m). The 70-year old, who found global fame as a member of the Police in the late 1970s and early 80s before going solo, becomes the latest big name musician to cash in on a long and successful career.  While the details of the deal were not disclosed, the volume and popularity of Sting’s work makes it one of the most valuable back catalogue transactions. “It felt natural to unite everything in one trusted home,” said the musician, real name Gordon Sumner. “It is absolutely essential to me that my career’s body of work has a home where it is valued and respected. Not only to connect with longtime fans in new ways but also to introduce my songs to new audiences, musicians and generations.” The deal unites Sting’s back catalogue, which had been with rival Sony Music Publishing, and his recorded music at Universal Music Publishing, part of the world’s biggest music group, where he has been signed at various labels for his entire career. “We are honoured that by choosing Universal for his music publishing, Sting’s entire body of work as a songwriter and recording artist – from the Police to his solo work – will all be within the Universal family,” said Sir Lucian Grainge, chairman and chief executive of the Amsterdam-listed music group. “It is a responsibility we don’t take lightly.” The streaming-fuelled recovery in the music industry has resulted in a gold rush for artists with global and evergreen hits, as music companies, private equity and publicly listed firms such as Hipgnosis seek to strike deals to control song rights. In December, Bruce Springsteen sold his entire song catalogue to Sony Music in a deal worth $500m, while David Bowie’s estate struck a $250m deal with Warner Music. In 2020, Bob Dylan sold his entire catalogue of 600 songs, including Blowin’ in the Wind and Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door, to Universal for almost $400m, seting an industry benchmark for future deals.

2/11/2022,"Tuesday’s US supreme court decision, Merrill v Milligan, which upheld Alabama’s racially gerrymandered congressional map, is reminiscent of the holding in the supreme court’s 1857 Dred Scott decision: “That a Black man (woman) had no rights which the white man was bound to respect.” Even though the two cases addressed two different situations, the overall disregard of the rights of Black people in America by the highest court in the country is the same. And just as the Dred Scott decision laid the groundwork for similar rulings that led to the continuation of white political power at the expense of Black political power, so too does the Miller case lay the groundwork for ending voting rights and political power for Black people in this country and a path towards white political power at all levels of government.  Some reading this will gasp and accuse us of misusing an explosive pre-reconstruction case to make a racially charged argument. But the reality is that the conservative gang of justices, under the leadership of Chief Justice John Roberts, had already joined it’s pre-1954 brethren who had indoctrinated Jim Crow policies and the disenfranchisement of Black voters. First through the supreme court’s abolishment of section 5 of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) in the 2013 Shelby v Holder, another Alabama case, they empowered every Republican-controlled state to enact a series of voter suppression laws targeting Black people with surgical precision. Next, through the 2018 Abbot v Perez case, the court took its first stab at the second protective tool in the VRA, section 2 by ruling to keep in place a blatantly racially gerrymandered map in Texas through, what Justice Sonia Sotomayor called “a disregard of both precedent and facts at the cost of democracy”. Then again, in 2021, in the Brnovich v DNC case, the court finally took the knock out punch to the remaining power left in the VRA’s Section 2, by leaving two Arizona bills in place, which as noted by Justice Elena Kagan in her dissent, disproportionally impacted minority citizens’ right to vote”. So, Tuesday’s Merrill case is just a link in a chain of US supreme court decisions meant to end Black voting protections and political power in this country. Even though Justice Roberts did not join his usual comrades, he signaled in his dissent that he intends to shred what is left of Section 2 when the full case reaches the supreme court. Moreover, by using the court’s shadow docket, the court has shown a greater sin in operation. While the conservative gang of six argue that they are simply staying the case because of the lower court’s ruling proximity to upcoming elections and not ruling on the merits of the case, Justice Kagan, in her dissent makes it clear that “this case is one more in a disconcertingly line of case in which the Court uses its shadow docket to signal or make changes in the law”. The conservative majority inappropriately stretched the meaning of “close election” to force the usage of a preliminary injunction standard found in Purcell v Gonzalez to create this unnecessary and hurtful outcome. In using the shadow docket in this manner, the conservative gang of five is not operating as judges evaluating the constitutionality of laws in a neutral manner, but has ignored legal precedent and become a partisan weapon of the Republican party. By allowing Alabama to use its racially gerrymandered congressional map to dilute Black voting power, the Republican party will continue to send six representatives to Congress next year instead of the five that would have likely resulted from fair maps. At a time when the Republican party is openly trying to take back power in the House of Representatives, it could not afford to lose a congressional seat in Alabama, and the conservative gang of five ensured this would not happen. In this regard, the current court is continuing a trend last seen when another conservative majority essentially decided the results of the 2000 presidential election, an election in which Florida’s results were impacted by racially disproportionate challenges to voting rights on the basis of inaccurate accusations of criminal convictions. But just as history of the post reconstruction and segregation era supreme court shows the motivation and pathway of this current supreme court, history also shows the pathway to victory, and we believe the following three recommendations are critical, even if just a beginning. First, President Biden must appoint an attorney to the supreme court who has been a champion for civil and voting rights. When nominating an appointment to the Supreme Court, Lyndon B Johnson boldly chose a champion of civil rights to carry that legacy forward to the court without fear of reprisal. In doing so he was not being expedient but doing what the moment required. The moment requires President Biden to be unapologetically bold in the same manner and nominate a justice like Sherrilyn Ifill, Barbara Arnwine, Kristen Clarke or Judith Browne Dianis who all have great legal scholarship and have been defenders of democracy. Second, Democrats must expand the court. Article 3 of the US constitution does not specify how many judges are required on the supreme court. The Democrats in Congress should use their power given to them by Black voters and increase the number of judges from nine to 11. Thirdly, we must have a serious discussion around and advocate for structural solutions which extend beyond which shape a gerrymandered map takes or which entities are entrusted to create those maps. We must immediately begin to rethink what majority rule means for historically attacked racial and ethnic groups, and how do we create mechanisms that address these limitations in ways that make majority rule and this entire democracy more fair and effective. Concepts such as those advocated by civil rights giant Lani Guinier, such as proportional representation, should receive full debate. Roberts has always been hostile to such mechanisms, and in doing so is serving as an impediment not only to Black voting rights but to a more inclusive democracy that would benefit all voters. To make these recommendations a reality, Black people, other marginalized groups and allies must continue to organize at the local level, state level and national level to make clear our demands. History shows that through organizing, major court victories such as Brown v Board of Education, which ended segregation in schools, were won. In doing so, Black people in America can build political power that protects voting rights beyond an act that requires reauthorization every 20 years or so, and we can take our destinies out of the hands of people in power who still believe that a Black man – and woman – has no rights that a white man has to respect.

2/11/2022,"A historic housing association is facing a revolt from tenants who are tired of living in cramped, damp and mouldy homes that some say are damaging children’s health. Residents of Evelyn Court estate in east London are calling on the Industrial Dwellings Society (IDS) to fix their homes after years of complaints about mouldy walls, and damaged furniture and clothes. The first Lord Rothschild was among philanthropists who founded IDS in 1885.  The society built the estate of 320 flats in 1934 to ease overcrowding and offer affordable rents. But some of the flats are now overcrowded, say tenants, who include care workers, cleaners and security guards. About 120 have signed a petition demanding better conditions and improved responsiveness from their landlord, after the London Renters Union helped them to organise. They staged a protest on Wednesday outside the landlord’s offices. They complained that the landlord and its contractors usually offered only temporary fixes of washing and repainting walls and sills, which left fungus to reappear. Romaine Murray, 42, a healthcare assistant, said she had struggled with mould for over a decade and described the fungus as “a monster”. She said her eight-year-old son had breathing difficulties throughout his infancy and she had also developed breathing problems. “I feel not even an animal should live like this,” she said. “I come into the house and smell damp and mould. My clothes smell of mould. I work nine to five, I don’t depend on the government to pay my rent, and this is not liveable for a human being.” She said she felt let down by IDS. “The chairman of the board should come out and see what is happening. These are hardworking people on the estate. Our money has value. We mean something.” IDS is a community benefit society whose declared purpose is to “provide social housing for people who would not be able to afford commercial rent levels or who cannot afford to purchase outright their own homes”. The Rothschild family is understood to have ended its connection with IDS at least 20 years ago. Tenants described rents of between £600 and £800 a month for two-bedroom flats, which is less than half the market rates in the area. IDS’s latest annual report for 2020 shows a turnover of £10m and an operating surplus of more than £2m. It had cash balances of more than £1.8m and net assets of nearly £36m. Fatima, 43, a single mother of six who has lived on the estate for 19 years, has mould regrowing around her windows after recently cleaning it up. She said her 14-month-old daughter had a wheezy cough and had been diagnosed with bronchitis, and two of her sons had previously had the same diagnosis. “I give up,” she said. “IDS don’t help.” IDS said it was “incredibly sorry” to hear of residents’ concerns and it would “investigate and respond to each and every one”. It said: “The damp and mould issue is mainly due to the age and construction of the estate. While we have been proactively repairing individual cases as they were reported to us, we have been concentrating our already constrained budgets towards upgrading the fire safety features in the block, which can save lives on a large scale.” It said its spending had been restricted by loan covenants and it was “in discussions with lenders to release more money for us to use on improving our properties”. After the protest, it said: “We have now had our minds focused by our residents and vow to instil within our teams an ongoing culture of prompt and positive action towards repairs requests and complaints.” Social housing providers are facing growing pressure over unfit homes, and soaring energy prices have raised fears of worsening mould and damp problems as low-income tenants turn off heating and keep windows closed to save money. According to government figures, 13% of dwellings in the social rented sector failed to meet the decent homes standard. Last summer the government said unsafe conditions including mould and vermin exposed by ITV at housing run by the UK’s largest social landlord, Clarion, was “completely unacceptable”. Clarion apologised to residents at the Eastfields estate in south London. The Housing Ombudsman, which investigates tenants’ complaints to determine maladministration by landlords, told a House of Commons select committee that inquiries and complaints had “increased substantially”. The most common complaint was landlords’ failure to respond to requests for repairs. It said landlords were “fatalistic” about damp and mould and must stop blaming tenants’ “lifestyle choices”.",News/Society,Tenants on east London estate revolt over damp and mouldy homes,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/10/tenants-on-east-london-estate-revolt-over-damp-and-mouldy-homes
2/11/2022,"A “charming” fraudster who conned a millionaire he met on Tinder into handing him almost £150,000 has been jailed for four-and-a-half years. Richard Dexter, 38, boasted to his victim, Amrita Sebastian, that he was worth almost £7m, owned private jets, was involved in Hollywood studios and had bought a hot air balloon on a whim.  Dexter, a father-of-two from Southsea in Hampshire, told Sebastian he was on the verge of a big windfall due to investments in biopharmaceutical technology. He convinced the Middle East-based executive he needed capital for a piece of equipment and duped her into sending him £141,500 in a series of payments, even spinning her lies while she was seriously ill in hospital. Robert Bryan, prosecuting, told Portsmouth crown court: “He claimed he was a successful businessman. He alluded to his immense wealth and private jets, expensive cars, and said he had more by way of interest in his investments than a doctor’s salary.” In one message to Sebastian, Dexter said: “Hey! Most of my friends did uni and have debts and worries and all earn £40,000 to £60,000. I bought a hot air balloon yesterday just because I could.” Sebastian, who travels to the UK twice a year from Dubai, met Dexter in August 2015 and he persuaded her he needed capital to start production of a piece of scientific equipment called a bioreactor paddle. He promised Sebastian he would pay her £100,000 as interest and over the course of 15 months, she made a series of payments as large as £68,000. She began to realise Dexter was not all he made out but felt “trapped” into keep on giving him money in the hope this would protect her cash. Finally she went to the police. Dexter’s grandmother also told the court he would regularly ask her to transfer him £10 because his “card wasn’t working”. One businessman Dexter had contact with, Roy Maunder, said: “His stories came across as fanciful ... He was a liar but a likeable character, he was a charmer.” Dexter was convicted of fraud, forging patent documents and perverting the course of justice. John Lucas, defending, said Sebastian’s money went on “general every day living” and to cover debts. But it also came out in court that he had paid £15,000 to a classic car company. Lucas added: “He had debts to close friends. He got himself into a pickle and was investing Bitcoin unsuccessfully. He’s a well-educated young man who made a big error of judgment.” Dexter, who sobbed during the hearing, told the court: “I haven’t been able to put into words what I would say to [Miss Sebastian] if she was here. “[I have not] had any courage to contact her or put it onto paper, but I’m very, very sorry to the point that I think about it every day, from the minute I wake up until I go to sleep. I can’t justify what I did.” Dexter’s partner, Hayley Jones, 37, wept and told the court her boyfriend of three-and-half years was a good father. Sentencing Dexter, Judge Timothy Mousley QC said: “I’m left in no doubt that dishonesty is a feature of your character and it is profound. What you did affected [Sebastian’s] mental health and you have never spared a thought for her.” A hearing to determine how money is paid back has been set for 7 April.",News/Technology," Hampshire Tinder fraudster jailed after conning woman for £150,000 ",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/10/hampshire-tinder-fraudster-richard-dexter-jailed
2/11/2022,"Dame Cressida Dick has “absolutely no intention” of standing down, she said on Wednesday, and maintains that she has been leading the Metropolitan police “very well”. The commissioner denied she was “complacent” or “arrogant” on Thursday, insisting she had transformed the force which has been hit by a series of scandals.  Dick is under intense pressure from London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, since last week’s revelations of officers at Charing Cross police station sending a barrage of messages that were racist and Islamophobic, and bragged aboutviolence toward women. On Wednesday, he insisted Dick must produce a compelling new plan to turn Scotland Yard around. Otherwise, he will publicly declare he has lost confidence in her – which government sources say should lead to her resignation. Dick used a phone-in show on BBC London to launch what could be either her fightback or a swan song for her tenure, which has been dogged by scandals and controversy since she started the role in 2017. She said: “I have absolutely no intention of going and I believe that I am, and have been actually for the last five years, leading a real transformation in the Met. “We have a service now, which is I’m absolutely certain, more professional, fairer, more transparent, more accountable, and closer to its communities and more effective in, for example, reducing violent crime, which has been going down year on year on year in almost every category.” She added: “I have been leading the Met very well.” She claimed she had sent the mayor the plan he wanted last Friday, with Khan launching a barrage of criticism in media interviews days after. City Hall said he was studying the letter and expected to hear more at their next meeting, which is expected within days. Dick also claimed Khan had expressed glowing confidence in the Met just a few weeks ago. Crucially, she accepted she needed the confidence of both the home secretary and London mayor to continue. “My role depends absolutely on those two role holders, the mayor of London and the home secretary … having trust and confidence in me,” she said. “They extended my contract just a few months ago. I sat at a meeting with them just three weeks ago at which the mayor said he had never had more confidence in the Met’s ability to deliver.” She added: “My ability to do a good job depends on having an effective working relationship and a trusting relationship with them.” The mayor of London is also the police and crime commissioner for the capital. The home secretary appoints the commissioner and has to have due regard for the mayor’s views. Dick said she was “laying down the law” to the Met, telling officers “enough is enough” and that those with discriminatory attitudes should leave. She assured whistleblowers they were safe to report wrongdoing without fear of reprisal. “We’ve got a problem of too much very bad behaviour and I’m determined with my team to sort that out,” she said. She added: “I think about my leadership all the time. I am not an arrogant person, I do adapt, I do change. I have absolutely done my very, very, very best and I will continue to do so until the day I finish as commissioner.” Dick’s five-year term finishes in April and she is then scheduled to start a two-year extension, granted by the home secretary and agreed by Khan last September. Dick said the revelations about hate messages at Charing Cross between 2016 and 2018 angered her. Nine of those investigated are still in the Met and two were promoted, one of whom, Dick said, had no finding of wrongdoing against them. The commissioner said: “I am seething angry about the whole thing. I’m very glad that the four individuals have left. “There is no place in the Met for sexism or racism or homophobia, for abuse [of] trust or for bullying, and in the last few days I have gone out extremely strongly to my colleagues and told them enough is enough.” Dick said a review set up under Lady Casey – after a Met officer kidnapped, raped and murdered Sarah Everard – would also help further transform the Met.",News/UK news,Cressida Dick has ‘absolutely no intention’ of resigning from Met,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/10/cressida-dick-has-absolutely-no-intention-of-resigning-from-met
