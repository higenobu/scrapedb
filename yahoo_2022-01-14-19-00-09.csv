1/14/2022,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — Attorneys for a woman who left her Alabama home to join the Islamic State terror group plan to continue fighting for her and her young son even though the Supreme Court declined to consider her lawsuit seeking to re-enter the United States, one of the lawyers said Wednesday. Hoda Muthana and her 4-year-old child, the son of a man she met while with IS, have been living in a Syrian refugee camp for nearly the entire life of the child, and it's unclear what steps might come next to argue for their admittance into the United States, said Christina Jump, who represents the woman's family. But Jump, who works with the Constitutional Law Center for Muslims in America, said attorneys are considering options. “We intend to stand by Hoda and her son and their rights to citizenship,” she said. “We do intend to keep working on her behalf.” The Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear the appeal of a lawsuit filed by relatives on behalf of Muthana, who was born in New Jersey and fled her home in suburban Birmingham in 2014 to join Islamic State, apparently after becoming radicalized online. She later decided she wanted to return to the United States, but the government determined she was not a U.S. citizen and revoked her passport while she was overseas, blocking her return. The government cited her father’s status as a diplomat from Yemen at the time of her birth in 1994. While the Supreme Court refused to consider overturning lower court rulings that said Muthana could be kept out of the country, Camp said she still believes “the Department of State does not have the authority to revoke citizenship in the manner that was done to Ms Muthana.” Both relatives and lawyers have a hard time maintaining regular contact with Muthana because she isn't allowed to have her own cellphone in the camp where she lives and internet service is spotty, said the attorney. Muthana has renounced IS and both she and her son have been threatened because of her stance, Camp said. The child's father is dead. The decision to revoke her passport was made under former President Barack Obama. The case gained widespread attention because former President Donald Trump tweeted about it, saying he had directed the secretary of state not to allow her back into the country.",U.S./Associated Press,Alabama woman who joined Islamic State stuck in refugee camp,https://news.yahoo.com/alabama-woman-joined-islamic-state-182652580.html
1/14/2022,"On The Rachel Maddow Show Thursday, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel weighed in on the bombshell news that Republicans in several states that President Biden won forged election documents in an attempt to give the election to former President Trump. Individuals in Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona and Georgia posed as electors, and gave the victory in each state to Trump. Everyone involved could face multiple charges and significant jail time, which Nessel believes could persuade some of them to talk, and could expose orchestration from the highest levels of government. “Once those individuals see that they could possibly be facing prison time, I do think we’re gonna see some people flip,” Nessel said, “and we’ll get some further information as to who orchestrated this in the first place, who told these people to do this in exactly this fashion, and I think it may go all the way to the top.” In every instance, the fraudulent documents followed almost the exact same template, leading Nessel to believe the individuals who signed those documents were just part of a bigger plan, which is why she referred the case to federal authorities. “What we have decided to do with the investigation, in light of the fact that of course we have seen, as you (Maddow) have pointed out multiple times now,” Nessel said, “various different false slate of electors from [several] different states, in what seems to be a coordinated effort between the Republican Parties in various different states, we think this is a matter that is best investigated and potentially prosecuted by the feds.” DANA NESSEL: They're the loudest who complained of election fraud. And yet, here they have committed, sensibly, the most significant case of election fraud ever in our state's history. KYLIE MAR: Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel appeared on ""The Rachel Maddow Show"" Thursday, where she spoke about the scheme in which Republicans in several states forged election documents in an attempt to give the election to former President Trump. Nestle expects authorities to be able to gather more information, as she thinks this may have been orchestrated at the highest levels of government. DANA NESSEL: Once those individuals see that they could possibly be facing prison time, I do think we're going to see some people flip, and we'll get some further information as to who orchestrated this in the first place. Who told these people to do this in exactly this fashion? And I think it may go all the way to the top. KYLIE MAR: Nessel's belief that the individuals involved were part of a bigger plan stems from the fact that in every instance, the fraudulent documents followed almost the exact same template, which is why on Thursday, she referred the case to the Department of Justice. DANA NESSEL: Various different false slate of electors from seven different states in what seems to be a coordinated effort between the Republican parties in various different states. We think this is a matter that is best investigated and potentially prosecuted by the feds. KYLIE MAR: And Nessel believes the individuals involved could be facing significant charges. DANA NESSEL: Our hope is that the federal authorities or the Department of Justice and the United States Attorney General Merrick Garland will take this in coordination with all the other information they've received and make an evaluation as to what charges these individuals might face.
