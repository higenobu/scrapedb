5/10/2022,"I am a fortysomething man in a long-term relationship – nearly 20 years – and have two children. For the past 10 years my partner has been having short-term lovers. These were clandestine, but more recently she has stopped hiding, called our relationship “open”, and currently has a lover who I do know about. But this “open relationship” can only be one-sided, because she is jealous and suspicious while I am basically not polyamorous. So why stay together? We get on, communicate well (other than the no-go zone of her other love life), rarely argue, are bonded by bringing up our children and are financially tied together. However, the years of suppressing my emotions – of jealousy, rejection, insecurity, being lied to – have left me broken. Sex (which we still occasionally do have) has become stressed: if I don’t perform enthusiastically, it will justify her seeking other lovers. Also, I am expected to remain sexually attracted to her, which gets more difficult when I know she’s been with someone else recently. We had frank talks when she offered to end her extramarital affairs and be monogamous with me – or plan how we might separate without affecting our children. We were both very upset, as we are very much still in love, and wish the sex side of our relationship wasn’t such a terrible mess. But it has occurred to me that I am emotionally and sexually broken after this past decade. If I was single again – or my partner was to become monogamous with me again – I don’t think I would be a viable person to be in a relationship with. How do I start to repair myself, inside or outside this relationship? It’s high time you set boundaries with your partner. In the past, you have been enormously accommodating – more than you really wanted to be – and that has left you with residual resentment. Underlying resentment is one of the most common causes of lowered libido, so no wonder you struggle to “perform enthusiastically”. It is highly likely that, if you stand your ground about the things that upset you – everything that gives you a sense that the unspoken contract between you is an unfair one – and ask specifically for the changes you need, you will elicit better behaviour and more appreciation, respect and even sexual interest from her. You will also feel far better about yourself. A restoration of the power balance between you should have the further effect of increasing the erotic connection between you. Then you will be in a better position to decide what you truly want and make the larger decisions.

5/10/2022,"When news leaked of the possible overturning of Roe v Wade, tweets and commentaries began circulating calling for people in the United States to learn from experiences in Argentina, Mexico, and Colombia – countries that have recently managed to decriminalize abortion – or from Chile, where it is included in the new constitutional project. This call is interesting because it reveals a new and powerful force rising from Latin America, where the right to abortion was won by a mass feminist movement in the streets. It also challenges the conventional map of progress and women’s rights. It is no longer an issue of an advanced “first world” or “global north,” while the “global south” lags behind. This is a unique political opportunity to reflect on the strategies and arguments for reproductive freedom deployed by the “green tide”, which fights for abortion rights. In Argentina, there are multiple reasons behind the expansion of the green tide and the demand for legal abortion from below. On the one hand, there is the long history of activism by the Campaign for the Right to Legal, Safe, and Free Abortion, formed 15 years ago as a nationwide network, defined by its federal character and its emphasis on participatory democracy and pluralism. On the other hand, more recently the feminist movement reached the mass scale with mobilizations for “Ni Una Menos. Vivas y libres nos queremos” (“Not One Woman Less. We want ourselves alive and free”), against the multiple and interconnected forms of gender-based violence. These were tied to the organization of the international feminist strikes that drew connections between feminized economic violence and precarity and other forms of gender-based violence. An important element for understanding the massiveness of these mobilizations was precisely the way in which the struggle for abortion was woven together with other feminist struggles. This allowed for cognitively and politically connecting the different forms of violence against women and feminized bodies as systemic violence. The violence of often deadly and costly clandestine abortion was thus connected to domestic violence, sexual harassment and the gendered pay gap in the workplace, and to the murders of female environmental and Indigenous activists in rural areas. In turn, this enabled constructing the demand for abortion in terms that go beyond a merely individual right, challenging the conception of the body as private property. The green tide flooded spaces everywhere, including schools, slums, unions, squares, and soup kitchens. Through this transversality, the body that had been put up for debate took on a collective and class dimension. This occurred because discussion about the clandestine condition of abortion directly referred to the costs that make it differentially risky according to one’s social and economic position. Those who were most harmed by the criminalization of abortion were the women and people with the capacity to gestate with the fewest economic resources, those who could not pay for safe abortions. Therefore, the right to abortion was considered inseparable from the demand that it be guaranteed in the public health care system. In turn, the demand for comprehensive sexual education in the public education curriculum allowed for deepening debates about sexualities, corporealities, relationships, and affects, displacing the question in a radical way. In this way, the broadening of the debate over abortion took place in terms of autonomy and class. Young people took leadership in the streets, with the patient support of the “pioneers” from older generations. New language became common sense, using gender-neutral terms in the highly gendered Spanish language, and specifically speaking of gestating persons, thanks to the struggle of non-binary people and trans men. The movement combined parliamentary lobbying with the autonomous practices of self-organized underground networks that had made abortion possible for many every year with massive and heterogeneous mobilizations in the street. Finally, the green tide has became an internationalist impulse mapping out struggles and legislation, bringing together a feminist agenda that goes well beyond a demand for an individual right. Understanding the relationship between unpaid and/or badly paid labour and expensive and unsafe abortions enabled a broader analysis of the forms of precarisation of our lives, modes of control in the name of the democracy of the labour market, and ecclesiastic tutelage over desire and autonomous decision-making. Furthermore, abortion has become the banner for rekindled regressive forces that articulated a true conservative counter-offensive. An internationalist perspective allows us to both map the global dimension of those reactionary forces and take inspiration and learn from struggles that have successfully linked the right to abortion to other feminist demands and attacks on collective autonomy.

5/10/2022,"West Ham’s search for a new striker has led to David Moyes identifying Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins as a key target this summer. Moyes is desperate to add more quality to his attack and the Scot is interested in Watkins, who has impressed since leaving Brentford for £28m two years ago. West Ham have explored the possibility of signing the England international and could decide to test Villa’s resolve by bidding for the 26-year-old, who has scored 11 goals for club and country this season. There has been talk that Steven Gerrard could be prepared to sell Watkins, although it is likely Villa would demand at least £50m for the forward. Watkins has made huge strides since moving to Villa Park and has a good chance of being included in England’s squad for the World Cup later this year. It is easy to see why Watkins appeals to Moyes. The former Brentford striker is a mobile, energetic presence in attack and would appear to suit West Ham’s style of play. West Ham usually operate with a lone striker and need someone who can occupy opposition defences on their own. Michail Antonio has performed that job admirably but Moyes is acutely aware of the need to provide the 32-year-old striker with more competition. Antonio, who is West Ham’s only senior striker, has only scored four goals in 2022 and has looked weary in recent months. West Ham, who hope to bounce back from the disappointment of their Europa League semi-final defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt by snatching sixth place from Manchester United, have other attacking targets. The east Londoners have not given up their slim hopes of signing Benfica’s Darwin Núñez, who is expected to join an elite European club, and could move for Armando Broja after the Chelsea forward’s loan at Southampton ends. Broja caught the eye during his appearances against West Ham earlier this season, though no negotiations over a transfer can take place until Chelsea’s ownership situation has been resolved. West Ham are also keeping track of Eddie Nketiah, who is yet to agree a new deal with Arsenal. Crystal Palace and Brighton are interested in signing Nketiah on a free transfer. The 22-year-old, who has boosted Arsenal’s top-four chances by scoring four goals in his past four games, wants regular football. Moyes will be given funds as he tries to help West Ham regularly challenge for a top-six spot. West Ham are also in the market for a centre-back and have looked at Nottingham Forest’s Joe Worrall as a potential replacement for Issa Diop, who could be allowed to leave. A move for James Tarkowski looks unlikely at the moment, with other clubs pushing harder to sign the Burnley centre-back on a free. West Ham are also looking to provide Aaron Cresswell with more competition at left-back, and want more cover for Declan Rice and Tomas Soucek in central midfield. Mark Noble is retiring at the end of the season and Alex Kral’s loan from Spartak Moscow has not been a success. Moyes tried to sign the Leeds United midfielder Kalvin Phillips in January. Andriy Yarmolenko is expected to leave West Ham this summer. Moyes will consider reinforcements in attacking midfield. He wants a left winger and has looked at Hull’s Keane Lewis-Potter.",Sport/Football,West Ham target summer move for Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/10/west-ham-target-summer-move-for-aston-villa-striker-ollie-watkins
5/10/2022,"France has said a deal on a proposed EU ban on Russian oil could be struck this week, despite opposition from the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who has compared the plans to an atomic bomb. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, is due to hold a phone call with the Hungarian leader later on Tuesday in a bid to break the deadlock. Clément Beaune, an ally of Macron and France’s Europe minister, said he thought “we could strike a deal this week”. Meanwhile, Ursula von der Leyen said there had been progress after making a last-minute dash to Budapest to discuss the plans with Orbán on Monday night. The European Commission president described the discussion as “helpful to clarify issues related to sanctions and energy security”. She added: “We made progress, but further work is needed,” promising to hold a video conference with other countries in the region to boost cooperation on oil infrastructure. EU diplomats insist all 27 member states are united behind the idea of a ban on Russian oil, with sources close to the talks describing the delay as technical rather than political. But the EU had hoped to announce the oil embargo and a new set of sanctions on influential Russians before last weekend, following Von der Leyen’s presentation of the plans at the European parliament last Wednesday. About a quarter of the EU’s oil comes from Russia, but some countries use far more. Slovakia and Hungary, landlocked countries nearly 100%-dependent on Russian oil, have been offered a delay in imposing the oil embargo until the end of 2024, to enable them to overhaul their refineries. The Czech Republic has been offered a delay until June 2024, while the full ban would come into force for the rest of the EU by the end of this year. Orbán said last week that “in its present form” the proposal was “tantamount to dropping a nuclear bomb on the Hungarian economy”. The Hungarian foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, repeated the phrase before Monday’s talks with Von der Leyen, according to Orbán’s international spokesman, Zoltán Kovács. Hungary says it needs five years and hundreds of billions of forints to convert its Százhalombatta refinery near Budapest, which can only take Russian oil. Hungarian officials say they could get oil from Croatia, but this would require their southern neighbour to boost its capacity. Orbán has also threatened to block attempts to sanction Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox church, who has described the attack on Ukraine as a “religious cleansing operation”. Speaking on Hungarian radio last week, Orbán said the Orthodox community in Hungary had written to him protesting about the cleric’s inclusion on a draft list that would mean a travel ban and asset freezes in the EU. Orbán said he opposed imposing sanctions on church leaders “because that would affect the religious freedom of communities in Hungary, which is sacrosanct”.",News/World news,Hopes for EU ban on Russian oil despite Hungary comparing plan to ‘nuclear bomb’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/10/hopes-raised-for-eu-oil-ban-on-russia-despite-hungary-comparing-plan-to-nuclear-bomb
5/10/2022,"More than 90% of neighborhoods in America’s major cities were unaffordable to the majority of local Black residents at the start of the pandemic, according to a new study on the worsening housing crisis in urban regions across the US. The National Equity Atlas, a research initiative focused on racial and economic equity, compared rents and wages in the 100 most populous American metropolitan regions in 2019 and examined whether the majority of households of different racial groups made enough income to afford median market rents in their neighborhoods. The findings, published on Tuesday and shared exclusively with the Guardian, paint a bleak picture of both severe racial inequality and a growing shortage of affordable housing in cities across the US. The authors found that: Only 7% of zip codes in the top 100 metro areas had rents that were affordable to Black residents of those cities in 2019, while 69% of zip codes were affordable to white households.  Forty-eight metro areas in the list had no zip codes at all that were affordable to Black residents. Only 16% of zip codes in the list had rents that were affordable to Latinx households. Twelve metro areas had zero zip codes with affordable rents for Latinx households, including Los Angeles, Orlando and Miami, cities with large Latinx populations. The majority of zip codes that were affordable for Black, Latinx and low-income households were classified as “low opportunity” neighborhoods, meaning they’ve long suffered from disinvestment and lack high-quality schools, clean air, parks, safe streets and good jobs, the researchers said. “Longstanding patterns of racial segregation are deepening,” said Rasheedah Phillips, co-author of the report and director of housing at PolicyLink, a research organization that co-produces the National Equity Atlas with the USC Equity Research Institute. “Low-income Black and brown households are being pushed out of their neighborhoods … and confined to the outskirts of what are otherwise prosperous cities.” The crisis was particularly acute in California, which has some of the least affordable housing in the nation and a humanitarian homelessness disaster. Ten California metro areas had no zip codes that were affordable to low-income renters or Black renters in 2019. The Riverside area, east of Los Angeles, was the only major metro region in California that had any neighborhoods affordable to low-income people. That region is one of the most polluted in the nation, and even there, only 14 zip codes were affordable in 2019, a sharp decrease from 2013. Research in LA has repeatedly found that families are living in overcrowded homes in immigrant and Latinx neighborhoods. “In California, incomes are not keeping up with rents, and we’re not building housing for people with low-incomes,” said Sarah Treuhaft, PolicyLink’s vice-president of research. America’s major cities have become increasingly unaffordable for all low-income residents in recent years. Only 8% of zip codes in the 100 metro areas were affordable for low-income households, the study found, down from 17% of zip codes in 2013. That trend played out in a majority of regions, the study concluded. Out of the 100 metro areas, 81 saw a decrease in affordability, 16 saw no change, and only three had moderate increases: Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Madison, Wisconsin; and Wichita, Kansas. All metro areas had zero zip codes affordable to very low-income households or people making less than 50% of the median income. Experts expect the crisis will only continue to grow. There are signs that the crisis has escalated since 2019, the authors noted; rents increased at sharp rates in cities across the US in 2021, and estimates show that as of April 2022, nearly 6m households were behind on rent in the US, roughly double the pre-pandemic figure. Meanwhile, Covid eviction protections are expiring across the country and America’s major cities are struggling to respond to escalating homelessness. The researchers based their analysis on housing data from the real estate site Zillow and income figures from the US Census, and looked at the changes from 2013 to 2019, the latest available data. By using median incomes and median rents to determine whether a zip code was affordable, the authors noted, the research illustrated the challenges facing households searching for available rentals, as opposed to the cost of all existing housing units in the region. Neighborhoods they deemed unaffordable still had some affordable rentals, but they were not plentiful. The authors urged local governments to protect vulnerable renters by creating permanent eviction protections and rental assistance programs. Cities should also prioritize preserving and expanding affordable housing units in gentrifying neighborhoods, so that when low-income renters are displaced from their homes, there are other options in their communities, the researchers wrote. They cited ongoing efforts in Rhode Island, Virginia and Missouri to invest federal money into housing trust funds meant to maintain and build units for low-income tenants. The report also advocated for investments to improve the quality of “low opportunity” neighborhoods, and cited local reparations programs meant to address the harms of racist housing policies. Evanston, Illinois, for example, established a “restorative housing” fund to provide Black residents with homeownership grants after decades of discriminatory zoning. Treuhaft said governments should prioritize spending Covid stimulus funds on housing. “There is an opportunity now in this moment of recovery to address these longstanding issues with targeted investments in communities that will otherwise be left behind.”",News/World news,Revealed: 93% of districts in major US cities unaffordable to Black residents,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/10/us-major-cities-unaffordable-black-residents
5/10/2022,"Millions of birds have been culled in the US after outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza or “bird flu”. The outbreaks have led zoos to temporarily close aviary exhibits and move birds away from the public. As we have reported, vets and animal advocates have called for restrictions on “cruel” methods of culling birds using extreme heat and steam. A giant leap in global food prices caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has helped three members of the super-rich Cargill family, who majority-own one of the world’s largest food companies, join the ranks of the world’s 500 richest people. Scientists have uncovered evidence that dangerous versions of superbugs can spread from pigs to humans. The discovery, made in Denmark, underlines fears that intensive use of antibiotics on farms is leading to the spread of microbes resistant to them. The Clostridioides difficile superbug infects the human gut and is resistant to all but three antibiotics in use today. An increase in the use of feedlots – as opposed to grass-fed production – in Brazilian beef production is being driven by China, according to reports. China buys about 50% of Brazil’s exported beef. Meanwhile, Uruguay’s beef production could hit record levels this year. A merino sheep named Shrekapo who grew an enormous fleece while evading capture in New Zealand is now 18.6kg lighter after its first shave. Shrekapo was spotted hiding in the rocks, and was caught later that day, carrying nearly half its bodyweight in wool. The animal had probably been roaming the hills alone for the past three winters. The UK’s free-range egg sector is on the brink of collapse because of sharply rising costs, the British Free Range Egg Producers Association has warned. In a recent poll, more than 70% of members said they would quit if price rises were not forthcoming. Meanwhile, an estimated 10% of the UK’s pig breeding herd has gone, as the National Pig Association (NPA) warned of significant gaps between the costs and pig prices. British food producers warned that perishable goods were losing their value due to congestion around the port of Dover caused by disruption to ferry services and customs operations. Fresh meat has reportedly been stranded for one to two days and possibly longer due to the current problems. One of the UK’s biggest food retailers has warned chicken could soon cost as much as beef as production costs soar. Steve Murrells, chief executive of the Co-op, said that feed costs had become a huge challenge for the poultry industry. Welfare campaigners now fear the cost of living crisis could stall the campaign to phase out the faster-growing broiler breeds associated with higher mortality, lameness and muscle disease than slower-growing breeds. A vet whistleblower has been awarded a £1.25m payout after losing her job at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) when she raised concerns over meat traceability in Northern Ireland. She had also highlighted serious breaches of animal welfare legislation within the meat supply chain, the Belfast Telegraph reported. The number of documented violations of legislation designed to reduce water pollution caused by agriculture in England has hit record levels as the rules remain largely unenforced. Last year had the highest number of recorded violations of the farming rules for water since the legislation was introduced in April 2018. An H3N8 strain of bird flu has been detected in humans for the first time, in China’s central province of Henan. The four-year-old boy infected had been in contact with chickens and crows raised at his home, according to reports from China’s National Health Commission. Northern Ireland will need to lose more than 1 million sheep and cattle to meet its new legally binding climate emissions targets. The large-scale reduction in farm animals comes after the passing of the ​​jurisdiction’s first ever climate act, requiring the farming sector to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Organic dairy, for so long the sector’s success story, is facing a crisis of confidence, with fears about whether people will keep buying organic milk, butter and cheese as food prices soar. Some UK organic farmers are being paid a milk price that is lower than the price some of their non-organic competitors get. A loophole in government regulations meant that chickens could still be called free-range even though they were no longer allowed outside because of repeated outbreaks of bird flu across the UK. The ban on birds being allowed outdoors was lifted at the beginning of May.And in the US, Charlie Hope-D’Anieri and photographer Danny Wilcox Frazier have reported on how factory pig farms are hollowing out rural communities in the state of Iowa.

5/10/2022,"Twenty-seven-year-old Birmingham-born director Sheikh Shahnawaz makes an impression with his macho low-budget debut about an undercover cop. It is a crime drama with two teaspoons of Guy Richie, a tablespoon of Line of Duty and a dollop of sentimental social-realism chucked in at end. It’s not without flaws but Shahnawaz is clearly ambitious and does well on what looks like a minuscule budget. Gurj Gill plays Danny, a Met detective recruited for an undercover operation: posing as an addict to sniff out major crack and heroin dealers. The chief constable, concerned about police corruption, keeps the job hush-hush, strictly between the two of them. (The film is jam-packed with implausibilities like this. If Danny’s job is off the books, who’s paying for it? Would a cop really go undercover as a bottom-rung addict to infiltrate a supply chain?) There is a nice chemistry between Danny and Cooks (Jason Adam), the funny, vulnerable young homeless addict he grooms to be his friend. The film then toggles between two timelines: Danny and Cooks working as dealers for gangster Imran (Nisaro Karim); and a bit later, when a fixed-up Danny has been promoted to Imran’s right-hand man. Here he is uneasy about lying to Cooks, and the film has things to say about the cost of the illicit drugs trade to addicts. Bluff is undoubtedly heartfelt but a bit of plot development might have sharpened things up – and it could do with losing 20 minutes. A drug adviser might also have been useful for the scene where Imran chops a pile of cocaine into a mountainous line that even Keith Richards in his heyday would have struggled to snort in one go.

5/10/2022,"The National Theatre in London is to stage Arthur Miller’s classic play The Crucible in a revival which its artistic director Rufus Norris says will “explore what it means to confront power in a time of political and social divide”. The Crucible will be directed by Lyndsey Turner in the National’s Olivier theatre, which has not presented Miller’s historical drama since 1990. “A revival of this story of mass panic and collective delusion seems particularly timely,” observed Norris, who said it would make for a “darkly thrilling production”. The Australian actor Brendan Cowell has been cast as farmer John Proctor. Erin Doherty, best known for portraying Princess Anne in The Crown, will play Abigail Williams whose past affair with Proctor leads her to stoke the hysteria about witchcraft that breaks out in 17th-century Salem. The scenario is used as an allegory for the anti-communist “red scare”, a political witch-hunt spearheaded by the House Un-American Activities Committee and senator Joseph McCarthy that reached boiling point in the 1950s. Doherty said that “to be working with Lyndsey Turner on this play at the National is immensely exciting and still utterly unbelievable to say out loud. I can’t begin to describe how grateful I am to get to rip open and explore a being as complex as Abigail Williams.” “The critics were not swept away,” wrote Miller of The Crucible’s first staging in 1953 but it has become one of his most frequently revived plays thanks to its potent consideration of persecution, suspicion, deception and the abuse of power. Ben Whishaw played Proctor in a Broadway production directed by Ivo van Hove in 2016 and Yaël Farber staged it at London’s Old Vic in 2014 with Richard Armitage in the role. Miller observed of his play: “I can almost tell what the political situation in a country is when the play is suddenly a hit there – it is either a warning of tyranny on the way or a reminder of tyranny just past.” The Crucible will open in the Olivier theatre in September. The following month, the National’s smaller Dorfman theatre will present The Boy With Two Hearts, the true story of an Afghan family forced to flee the Taliban and seek lifesaving health treatment in the UK. The play was produced at Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff last year and is based on the book of the same name by Hamed Amiri. It will return to Cardiff before its National run. Graeme Farrow, artistic director of Wales Millennium Centre, said: “This is a Welsh story and an Afghan story that deserves as wide an audience as possible, particularly as the number of people fleeing violence and persecution rises across the globe.” The National also announced details of a UK and Ireland tour of The Ocean at the End of the Lane, its popular 2021 adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s book.

5/10/2022,"Big meat and food conglomerates threaten to push out smaller producers of meat alternatives in the same way they have affected other food industries, according to two recent reports. Meat companies such as JBS and Cargill have invested heavily in plant-based proteins and laboratory-grown meats in recent years and bought out several smaller companies, according to a report published Tuesday by the non-profit Food & Water Watch and a March report from IPES-Food, a coalition of food systems experts. The animal meat conglomerates are joining other food giants that already control about 80% of the meat alternative market, including Kellogg’s, which owns the MorningStar Farms brand, and Conagra, which owns Gardein. “With most of these products you won’t see the parent company’s name on the label,” said Philip Howard, an associate professor at Michigan State University and lead author of the IPES-Food report. People buying meat alternative products “may not realize they’re supporting those big companies”, he added. The meat substitute market is predicted to grow rapidly, from $4.2bn in sales in 2020 to $28bn in 2025, according to IPES-Food. Much of that growth will come from the already robust plant-based meat industry, the report said, but several conglomerates have also invested hundreds of millions to develop lab-grown meat – meat produced in bioreactors without the need to slaughter animals. Both plant-based and lab-grown meat producers say their products are better for the environment than meat. Plant-based alternatives have a median carbon footprint 93% smaller than beef, according to a report from Johns Hopkins University. And German scientists have said replacing even 20% of the world’s beef consumption with microbial proteins such as Quorn could cut deforestation in half. Even as the meat industry downplays the value of fake meat, as pressure grows from climate scientists and other experts to dramatically reduce meat consumption, some big meat companies may be looking for other revenue streams. Cargill has been active in the sector, investing in lab-grown meat company Aleph Farms and creating its own plant proteins. Tyson Foods is selling plant-based meats under its Raised & Rooted brand and has invested in several plant-based and lab-grown meat companies. JBS, the world’s biggest meat company, last year bought lab-grown meat firm BioTech Foods and also Dutch plant-based meat company Vivera, which has the corporate tagline: “Life is better when you eat less meat.” “They’re covering their bases because this is an area that’s growing very quickly,” Howard said. “These companies have gotten big and powerful by using every strategy they can.” US federal regulators are doing little to stop consolidation in the alternative meat sector, said Amanda Starbuck, research director for Food & Water Watch, who added that it could end up looking similar to the beef industry, where four companies – JBS, Cargill, Tyson Foods and National Beef Packing – control 85% of the industry. “Plant-based meat brands are hardly an alternative to the current system if they continue to entrench corporate power,” concludes the Food & Water Watch report. “It shows the futility of voting with your dollar,” Starbuck said. It’s a concern echoed in the IPES-Food report, which says corporate control threatens to undermine gains from reducing reliance on animals by replicating some of the problems of the traditional meat industry, including mass-produced, monocultured ingredients and energy-consuming methods. Increases in meat alternatives could “reinforce the power relations that keep current systems in place, and fail to address the question of how systemic changes will be achieved,” notes the report. With big companies likely to consolidate control of the meat alternative industry, Howard worries the landscape will resemble the US craft beer industry. While the US has nearly 9,000 breweries, the vast majority are tiny and can’t distribute beer beyond their neighborhood bars, and alcohol conglomerates have snapped up most of the larger craft brewers. Smaller producers could find it difficult to get the grains and other plants needed for meat alternatives, said Celia Homyak, co-director of UC Berkeley’s Alternative Meats Lab. Big companies “are going to capture all of these ingredients and take them away from these smaller companies that are doing the innovation,” Homyak said. “They have the power of money and size.” But she also sees benefits in increased interest from big meat companies. Corporate investment and a smaller industry aren’t necessarily bad, Homyak said. “We need more people to be entering this space, and obviously it will shrink down because you can’t have a million players,” she said. “I’m not actually that worried about the big conglomerates coming in because it shows these larger corporations think this industry is valid.” At least 1,300 startups were producing meat alternatives as of six months ago, said Zak Weston, a senior supply chain manager with the Good Food Institute, a non-profit that advocates for fewer animal-based proteins. “There is a lot happening right now in the ecosystem, and large companies are playing a role. And we think that’s a positive,” Weston said. But some worry investment from big meat companies will stifle innovation in an industry that depends on it. The industry is better off with smaller companies without corporate ties, said Dan Staackmann, who founded Upton’s Naturals 16 years ago. The Chicago-based company, which Staackmann says has never taken outside money, sells vegan proteins in stores and restaurants around the country. “You take that money and suddenly someone’s looking over your shoulder,” he said. “I can do more with $100,000 than some of these companies can do with $100m, and I think that’s the same with a lot of entrepreneurs. You just can’t steer a large ship quickly enough in a changing market like this one.” But independence may be fleeting for many producers, said Howard, the Michigan State professor. Conglomerates have partnerships with major grocery chains and distributors, he said, so anyone looking to expand their meat alternatives beyond their neighborhood will feel pressure to sell. “It’s going to be very difficult for those small and medium-sized firms to stay in business,” Howard said. “We have economic systems that reinforce the position of the rich and powerful. Just breaking into supermarket shelves is very difficult for smaller producers.”",News/Environment,"Big meat threatens to gobble up fake meat companies, say studies",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/10/meat-alternatives-industry-threat-monopoly
5/10/2022,"When patients came to Kelly Nichols, a nurse practitioner at a clinic in Newark, Delaware, needing care for their miscarriages, Nichols often prescribed medications to help with the process. But if patients came to Nichols seeking to end a pregnancy, she was not able to prescribe them the exact same medications. “It was just purely a political block on it,” Nichols said, that had nothing to do with health or safety – medication abortions, which now account for the majority of abortions in the US, have been shown to be very safe. Instead, her patients seeking medication abortion need to schedule a second appointment with a state-certified physician at a different facility, a time-consuming and sometimes arduous process, especially for those who weren’t able to take more time off from work or travel to a different facility. But all of that is now changing. A new law allows physician assistants and advanced practice registered nurses, who are already able to prescribe many medications, to prescribe the medication for abortions as well. Democratic governor John Carney signed the legislation into law last week. The law will increase the number of providers in Delaware and make the process of getting an abortion less complicated. Medication abortion, also known as the abortion pill, can be used safely up to 10 weeks into a pregnancy. The new law is one of several ways abortion and other forms of reproductive health care are becoming more accessible in Delaware, even as restrictions and bans loom in other states across the country. Known as the First State for being the first to ratify the US constitution, Delaware was also the first in the wake of Trump’s election to codify Roe into state law in 2017, protecting the right to abortion even if the landmark supreme court decision is overturned. The 2017 law ensures access to abortion until viability, defined at 20 weeks of pregnancy in Delaware. Procedures are also permitted later if the patient’s life or health is threatened or if there’s a serious fetal anomaly. Codifying abortion protections into state law “really is the strongest protection that a state could give,” said John Culhane, professor of law at Widener University Delaware Law School. And on 1 December, the same day the court heard arguments on the 15-week abortion ban in Mississippi that could overturn Roe, the first Planned Parenthood clinic in a decade opened in Delaware’s most rural county. Delaware is one of several blue states introducing new laws and planning to increase services as the constitutional right to abortion in the US looks to be in peril. Other states looking to expand access include Vermont, New York, California and Maryland. Washington and Connecticut have also passed laws to extend protections to providers aiding in the abortions of people who travel from out of state. With the overturn of Roe, about 16 states will be able to continue providing abortion services without restriction or with minor restrictions, said Ruth Lytle-Barnaby, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Delaware, which runs the clinic where Nichols works. “Those of us that are left are going to have to absolutely gear up to be able to see a lot more people,” she said. The new law on medication prescription “opens up more access for more patients, because we will be able to expand the number of providers providing this care.” The Delaware expansions are not without opposition. Although the state reliably goes blue, the southern part is more rural and conservative. News of the new clinic in the southern town of Seaford, for instance, was greeted with protests and local restrictions before it even opened. Seaford, which describes itself as a “traditional” community, is an industrial town home to less than 8,000 people. It’s nestled in the most rural part of the state, where chickens tend to outnumber people – and Trump signs still hang, even in the state Joe Biden represented in Congress for decades. Up north, the populous New Castle county always goes deep blue, pulling the rest of the state with it. But here in Sussex county, the political map is red, and residents tend to hold more conservative views. In December, after news of the new clinic, the Seaford city council passed an ordinance requiring fetal tissue from miscarriage or abortion to be buried or cremated, a cost to be borne by patients or providers. According to Delaware law, however, fetal tissue prior to 20 weeks of gestation is not considered human remains, and a death certificate – which is required for cremation or burial – is not issued. In January, the state’s justice department took the unusual step of suing the city because of the ordinance’s conflicts with state legislation on handling fetal tissue. It would have also added prohibitive costs, opponents say. For now, this ordinance is blocked, and the Seaford clinic opened without the restrictions. Delaware’s intrastate struggles are “a microcosm of the sorts of things we can expect to see in states that continue to allow abortion access, where there’s resistance to that in certain localities”, Culhane said. Every year, Delaware state legislators introduce at least one bill to restrict reproductive health, Lytle-Barnaby said. “Even in the progressive states, we have to re-litigate this every single year.” And even in states that do not have restrictive laws on abortion, there are limits on receiving care. There may be areas with no providers for miles around, and it can be difficult for some patients to book appointments and take off work to travel within or outside the state. “Delaware has three counties, and they’re all classified as medically underserved,” said Lytle-Barnaby. The average wait time for any patient to see a new doctor is 28 days for Sussex county and 32 days for Kent county, she said. Sussex county is also growing the fastest, with a 23% increase in the past decade, Lytle-Barnaby said – and at the same time, the county has the highest rates of uninsurance and child poverty in the state. The last clinic in Sussex county, located in Rehoboth Beach, closed in 2011, and the clinic in nearby Salisbury closed in 2015. The location in Seaford was chosen, in part, to be more accessible to patients from outside the state as well, since those areas also have poor access to care and high poverty rates. Delaware is taking other steps to strengthen reproductive health. A program on contraceptives has proven a model for other states to reduce unintended pregnancies. Long-term contraceptives, like IUDs and implants, are very effective at preventing pregnancies. But it can be difficult to find providers who offer this type of birth control, and some people may not know they even exist. DelCAN, which started in 2014, helps smooth the process – training providers and making these forms of contraception easy to access and covered by insurance. Medical providers ask a simple question at health visits: “Do you want to get pregnant in the next year?” If the answer is yes, they talk about prenatal vitamins and health care. If it’s no, they talk about “set it and forget it” contraceptives that are more effective than methods like the pill or condoms. When it started, Delaware had one of the highest rates of unintended pregnancies in the nation, but that rate fell by 20% – twice as much as other states – after the introduction of the program. Abortions in Delaware also declined by 37% between 2014 and 2017, according to a Guttmacher report. States can go even further to shore up abortion rights. Delaware, for instance, still requires parental notification for patients under 16, and public funds like Medicaid can’t cover abortion except in the cases of rape, incest or danger to the patient’s life. “There are some states where Medicaid funds abortion – it’s a health service,” Lytle-Barnaby said. Expanding Medicaid to cover abortion would also help people living in poverty, Culhane said, “because a lot of the burden of these laws is going to fall on poor women”. A bill in Oregon, introduced in the wake of neighboring Idaho’s proposed restrictions, would provide $15min funding for abortion services, including for out-of-state patients. States can also pass laws protecting providers if patients travel from states where abortions are banned, as Washington and Connecticut have done. Such protections may be necessary given the likelihood of states seeking to crack down on out-of-state travel for abortions, Lytle-Barnaby and Culhane said. But amid all the politics, the health care Nichols provides is straightforward. The law now allowing her to prescribe medications for abortion will make the care she offers easier and more accessible to patients. “Management of other pregnancy complications is really pretty much using the same exact skill set and knowledge and medications as provision of medication abortion,” she said. “So it really just makes sense – it makes sense to be able to provide a continuity of care for the patients.”",News/US news,‘The strongest protection a state could give’: how Delaware is improving access to abortion,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/10/delaware-access-abortion-care
5/10/2022,"After last year’s 5,000-mile journey across Europe to draw attention to the plight of refugees, Little Amal, a giant puppet of a 10-year-old Syrian girl, has travelled to Poland to meet children who have fled the war in Ukraine. Amal became an international symbol of displacement and loss – but also of compassion and generosity – when, with a team of puppeteers and support workers, she walked from Gaziantep near the Turkish-Syrian border to Manchester between July and October. This week the 3.5-metre puppet will visit the Polish cities of Lublin and Kraków to meet Ukrainian refugee children and families who have left their homes since Russia launched its military offensive on 20 February. Amir Nizar Zuabi, the artistic director of The Walk, Amal’s trans-European journey, said: “At a time of unprecedented global change, Amal’s journeys transcend borders, politics and language to tell a new story of shared humanity – and to ensure the world doesn’t forget the millions of displaced children, each with their own potential to enhance the communities in which, as we hope, they will find refuge.” The Polish trip, which includes visiting Przemyśl, a town close to the border with Ukraine, is at the invitation of the mayors of Lublin and Kraków and the Ukrainian embassy in Poland. Amal and her crew have taken with them aid and supplies aimed at the needs of young children. Aleksander Sola, the vice-president of the Folkowisko Foundation, which is supporting the trip, said: “We hope that Amal will draw the world’s attention to the refugee crisis that Europe has not seen since the end of world war two. Amal symbolises the millions of refugees who have been forced to leave their homes.” Amal, whose name means hope in Arabic, was created by Handspring, the company that made the equine puppets in War Horse.

5/10/2022,"Good morning. The White House has dismissed Monday’s Victory Day speech by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, as “revisionist history” and said his suggestion that western aggression led to the Ukraine war was “patently absurd”. In the US, congressional Democrats have reportedly agreed to provide as soon as today a further $39.8bn in additional aid for Ukraine, exceeding president Joe Biden’s request last month for $33bn including more than $20bn in military assistance. Senate leaders were prepared to move quickly to enact the new proposal, reports said, which includes an additional $3.4bn for military aid and $3.4bn in humanitarian aid. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged the international community to take immediate steps to end a Russian blockade of his country’s ports in order to allow wheat shipments and prevent a global food crisis. The Black Sea export port of Odesa was struck by missiles on Monday. Have all Ukrainian refugees been made welcome in other countries? A warm welcome has been given to most people fleeing Putin’s war but Roma women and children are struggling to find homes. What else is happening? Here’s what we know on day 76 of the invasion. The year the world breaches for the first time the 1.5C global heating limit set by international governments is fast approaching, a forecast shows. The probability of one of the next five years surpassing the limit is now 50%, scientists led by the UK Met Office found. As recently as 2015, there was zero chance of this happening in the following five years. But this surged to 20% in 2020 and 40% in 2021. The global average temperature was 1.1C above pre-industrial levels in 2021. It is also close to certain – 93% – that by 2026 one year will be the hottest ever recorded, beating 2016, when a natural El Niño climate event supercharged temperatures. It is also near certain that the average temperature of the next five years will be higher than the past five years, as the climate crisis intensifies. “The 1.5C figure is not some random statistic. It is rather an indicator of the point at which climate impacts will become increasingly harmful for people and indeed the entire planet,” said Prof Petteri Taalas, the head of the World Meteorological Organization, which published the new report. What will happen if the temperature stays over the 1.5C global heating limit? The world’s scientists warned in 2018 that 1.5C of global heating would bring severe impacts to billions of people, including heatwaves, floods and even snowstorms. The Republican governor of Mississippi has refused to rule out attempting to ban some forms of contraception if the supreme court ruling that guarantees the right to abortion should fall. “That is not what we’re focused on at this time,” Tate Reeves said. The ruling, Roe v Wade, seems likely to be overturned this summer, after the leak of a draft supreme court decision supported by five conservatives on the nine-member court. The leak prompted celebrations among conservatives and protests among liberals, as a near-50-year battle over a key privacy right approached a decisive moment. Like other states, Mississippi has a “trigger law”, which, if Roe falls, will outlaw almost all abortions, with exceptions in cases of rape or threat to the life of the mother. The case at issue in the draft ruling, Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, originated in Mississippi. Could Roe v Wade be a ‘precursor to larger struggles’? It could be a milestone in America’s seemingly inexorable journey from United States to divided states as the likely demise of Roe v Wade could drive the biggest wedge yet between what appear to be two irreconcilable nations coexisting under one flag. The capture of a former Alabama jail official, along with a murder suspect she allegedly helped escape from custody, ended in tragedy yesterday when the jail official, Vicky White, fatally shot herself after a police chase. White, 56, was accused of fleeing with Casey White, 38, who is back in custody. Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr, the son and namesake of the late dictator, has won a landslide presidential election victory, signalling an extraordinary rehabilitation for one of the country’s most notorious political families. With more than 90% of an initial count concluded, he had almost 30 million votes. Sri Lanka has deployed thousands of troops and police to enforce a curfew after five people were killed in the worst violence in weeks of protests over an unprecedented economic crisis. Nearly 200 people were wounded as prime minister Mahinda Rajapaksa resigned, but that did little to calm public anger. A member of the World Wrestling Entertainment Hall of Fame crashed into and killed a man while driving drunk in Florida earlier this year, authorities said. Tamara Lynn “Sunny” Sytch caused the wreck that killed Julian Lasseter. A toxicology test confirmed she was more than three times over the legal limit. Andy Warhol’s 1964 silk-screen portrait of Marilyn Monroe has sold for $195m at auction, setting new records for 20th-century art and art made by an American artist. The painting sold for a hammer price of $170m. Added fees gave it a final price of $195m. The sale broke the previous record for an artwork made in the 20th century, set by Pablo Picasso’s 1955 painting Les Femmes d’Alger (Version O), which sold for $179.4m, including fees, in 2015. Many of us have a never-ending list of tasks that are work-related, but not quite work: writing up minutes from meetings, organising holiday parties, shopping for leaving gifts. Many, if not most, working women accept it as just part of the job. But taking one for the team could be holding all women back. A new book argues that “non-promotable work” is the invisible hurdle to gender equality in the workplace, with women’s time and energy being disproportionately expended on thankless tasks. The international aviation industry has failed to meet all but one of 50 of its own climate targets in the past two decades, environment campaigners say. A report commissioned by the climate charity Possible assessed every target set by the industry since 2000 and found that nearly all had been missed, revised or quietly ignored. The charity says the findings undermine a UK government plan to leave airlines to reduce their emissions through self-regulation. Belgian cartoonist Pieter De Poortere was trying to do his bit for the environment: eating less meat and diligently sorting his rubbish – glass, paper, plastics. He realised it wasn’t enough. So he put his best-known character to work, as part of an international art project, aiming to draw attention to the problem of plastic production.

5/10/2022,"Young Thug, one of the most influential and successful rappers in the US who has twice topped the Billboard album chart, has been arrested on suspicion of gang involvement, and accused of a number of other alleged offences. Twenty-seven other associates of his record label Young Stoner Life (YSL, also known as Young Slime Life) are named in the indictment, with YSL characterised as a street gang. Members are accused of a range of crimes, including murder and attempted murder, plus robbery, witness intimidation and drug dealing. In a TV interview, Young Thug’s lawyer Brian Steel said the rapper had “committed no crime whatsoever and we will fight to my last drop of blood to clear him”. Young Thug, real name Jeffery Williams, has been detained at an Atlanta jail and will appear at an initial hearing on Tuesday. He is charged with “participation in criminal street gang activity”. In the indictment document, he is also accused of threatening to kill a man at a shopping mall; renting a car that was used during the murder of a man in 2015, Donovan Thomas Jr; and intending to distribute methamphetamine – but he has not been charged with these individual offences, described as “overt acts” that furthered the broader criminal conspiracy. All 28 defendants are also charged with violating Georgia’s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (Rico) – which was passed to help bring charges against gangs and organised crime – with YSL. Another successful rapper named in the indictment is Gunna, real name Sergio Kitchens, who is indicted on a single count of violating the Rico act. He has also twice topped the US album chart, most recently in January with his album DS4Ever. Gunna has not been arrested, but a spokesperson for the district attorney’s office confirmed to the New York Times that others among the 28 defendants had been. Another YSL rapper, Yak Gotti – real name Deamonte Kendrick – is one of five accused of the murder of Donovan Thomas Jr. Three people accused of being YSL members are also accused of the attempted murder of rapper YFN Lucci, who was later stabbed in jail after he was indicted on a murder charge. Named as a victim in the 88-page indictment is Lil Wayne, whose tour bus was allegedly shot at by a YSL associate in 2015. Rap lyrics by Young Thug are mentioned in the indictment, accused of being “an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy”. Select Gunna lyrics, and even his YSL-branded jewellery, are accused of the same offence. The citing of lyrics as evidence of criminality is controversial. In January, rappers including Jay-Z, Meek Mill and Killer Mike called for a change in New York law that would prevent rap lyrics being used as evidence in criminal trials. The rappers Tekashi 6ix9ine, Tay-K and the late Drakeo the Ruler have all seen their lyrics cited during their respective trials in recent years. Celebrated for his expressive, inventively melodic flow, Young Thug is a musical figurehead in Atlanta, the city that has become arguably the centre of US rap in recent years. As well as scoring US No 1 singles with Drake and Travis Scott, he has appeared on hits with Post Malone, Migos and Megan Thee Stallion, and crossed over into the pop world in 2017 with his appearance on Camila Cabello’s US and UK No 1 hit Havana.",Arts/Music,"US rapper Young Thug arrested on gang-related charges, Gunna also indicted   ",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/10/us-rapper-young-thug-arrested-on-gang-related-charges-gunna-also-indicted
5/10/2022,"Priti Patel now has to make one of the most important decisions of her career: will she bow to heavy pressure from the United States and send a vulnerable man who has been convicted of no crime to face an indeterminate number of years in an American jail where he may experience intimidation and isolation? Her decision is imminent and all other legal avenues have been explored. This was the scenario 10 years ago in the case of Gary McKinnon, the computer hacker who, working out of his north London bedroom, trawled through the computer systems of Nasa and the US defence department in search of information about UFOs and left behind some mildly rude messages about the systems’ sloppy security. The home secretary was Theresa May, who halted extradition proceedings at the last minute. Now Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder and also a vulnerable man – who has been in Belmarsh high-security prison for three years without being convicted of any crime – is facing extradition, with the issue due to be decided this month. Once again, the home secretary has an opportunity to demonstrate, as May did, that respect for justice and humanity are much finer and more enduring qualities than appeasement. It is worth recalling the words of party leaders in support of McKinnon after Labour home secretaries – to their great shame – declined to intervene in the years after his initial arrest in 2002. Nick Clegg, then leading the Liberal Democrats in opposition, said that McKinnon “has been hung out to dry by a British government desperate to appease its American counterparts”. David Cameron, before he became prime minister, had said: “McKinnon is a vulnerable young man and I see no compassion in sending him thousands of miles away from his home and loved ones to face trial.” The current case is different in that, while McKinnon remained at liberty, Assange has been held in custody alongside murderers and terrorists after the seven years he spent in the Ecuadorian embassy, seeking political asylum. He should have been given bail long ago to be with his wife, Stella Moris, whom he married in prison in March, and their two young children; he could simply be electronically tagged and monitored. It is also different in that he faces charges under the Espionage Act which carries a potential sentence of 175 years. And yes, the US criminal justice system does actually impose such medieval sentences. Last year, at the Summit for Democracy, Joe Biden pledged to support a free press: “It’s the bedrock of democracy. It’s how the public stay informed and how governments are held accountable. Around the world, press freedom is under threat.” As it happens, it is 50 years since Daniel Ellsberg was being prosecuted under a similar law to the ones Assange faces for releasing the Pentagon Papers which exposed the lies and hypocrisies of the Vietnam war. He is one of Assange’s staunchest supporters. This week he told me that “this extradition would mean that journalists, anywhere in the world, could be extradited to the US for exposing information classified in the US”. He argues that it would also set a precedent that any reporter could be extradited to other countries for exposing information classified in those countries. Assange also has the backing of all organisations that battle on behalf of freedom of expression, from Amnesty International to Reporters Without Borders. As Julia Hall of Amnesty International puts it: “Demanding that states like the UK extradite people for publishing classified information that is in the public interest sets a dangerous precedent and must be rejected.” In March, the justice secretary, Dominic Raab, told the Daily Mail of plans for a new bill of rights: “We’ve got to be able to strengthen free speech, the liberty that guards all of our other freedoms, and stop it being whittled away surreptitiously, sometimes without us really being conscious of it.” How empty those words will be if Assange is extradited. It was, after all, thanks to WikiLeaks and Assange that the world saw the secret video of a US aircrew falsely claiming to have encountered a firefight in Baghdad and then laughing after their airstrike killed a dozen people, including two Iraqi journalists. Should our ability to see that footage be “whittled away surreptitiously”? Another Assange advocate is Janis Sharp, McKinnon’s mother, who fought so gallantly on his behalf – a battle now being made into a film. “Ten years’ loss of liberty is surely more than long enough for an extremely ill, autistic man, a whistleblower who shared information of a war crime that he felt was in the public interest to know,” she told me. “Seeing my own son Gary McKinnon suicidal and in permanent mental torment through the terror of proposed extradition, leaves me in no doubt that much-needed compassion must be brought to bear in this very lengthy tragic case.” Patel has an important choice, but it is not difficult. Extradition should be resisted. Assange should be released and allowed to resume a normal life. Anyone who seriously values freedom of expression should support his fight.

5/10/2022,"“What is the secret of Meghan Markle’s hair?” is the opening line of this sepulchral and Kraftwerkian entry by Konstrakta. She then goes on to talk about the importance of hydration, about how under-eye circles can signal liver distress, and also marvels about the autonomous nervous system. “The artist is supposed to be healthy,” is the conclusion she reaches when the first refrain starts, which then evolves into a gospel-like exclamation: “God grant us health!” It turns out that rather than having a tabloid-worthy interest in Meghan’s beauty regime, Konstrakta’s song is actually a satirical swipe at the venal world of health insurance and the cult of beauty. This ode to recycling, zero-waste initiatives and sustainable vegetarianism is, in true Eurovision fashion, offset by extreme lecherousness and sexual metaphors that an 11-year-old will find absolutely delightful: “I’m a beast instead of a killer / forget the hotdogs ‘cause my sausage is just bigger.” Melodies alternate between show tunes (complete with brass) and something vaguely akin to rapping – which is to say, given this is Eurovision, very vaguely akin indeed. Unfortunately, the fun police have said that Citi Zēni need to censor the final word of what is the most startling opening line in Eurovision history: “Instead of meat, I eat veggies and pussy.” The Turin stage direction and set design, then, could determine whether this song will rise like a camp masterpiece or be condemned to infamy – we hope there’s a cat involved. Lyrics such as “the fields are blooming but her hair is grey”, and “I’ll always find my way home, even if all roads are destroyed”, mean that Ukraine’s entry has huge resonance as the war rages. Even if Eurovision bars outright political statements, this song has the subtle gravitas of another recent Ukrainian entry, Jamala’s 2016 song 1944, which detailed the massacre of Crimean Tatars – and is a far cry from cheesy peace-themed songs such as Germany’s Ein Bisschen Frieden (A Bit of Freedom, a winner by a huge margin in 1982) and Italy’s Insieme: 1992 (Together: 1992, confusingly winning in 1990). Ever since listening to Romania’s yodelling-enhanced pop-rock in 2017, I have had a soft spot for genre crossover, and Kalush Orchestra combine rap, folk, a thumping bass line and the use of flute, all dressed in folk garb but with a tongue-in-cheek twist: spot that hot pink, hand-knitted fisherman’s hat. In 2003, DJ Bobo gave us an earworm of utmost nonsense: “What can make you move, chihuahua!” Almost 20 years later, Norwegian band Subwoolfer urge us in a similar fashion: “Before that wolf eats my grandma / give that wolf a banana!” They lay out their Red Riding Hood redux with a lupine meet-cute (“Not sure you have a name, so I will call you Keith”) before the wolf turns nasty and needs warding off with some tropical fruit. The Eurodance backing is sleek, and huge props to the costume department for the full-body leotards and wolf heads. Italy loves a good ballad duet: where else can you so freely revel in vocal prowess, pathos and overacting? In 1989, Eurovision had a taste of it with virtuoso duo Fausto Leali and Anna Oxa singing about how each wanted to physically tie the other up to avoid having their love contaminated by the outside world; now, X Factor and Sanremo veteran Mahmood and erstwhile SoundCloud rapper Blanco update the trite “love duet” formula by singing about how, in relationships, even the best intentions lead to stumbling and falling. Strong lyrics aside, they maintain enough vocal and emotional restraint to avoid veering into parody. Achille Lauro was a rapper with fondness for Matrix-like getups before becoming an unlikely muse for Gucci’s Alessandro Michele at the end of 2019. Right before the pandemic hit, he became a viral sensation when, during Italy’s Sanremo festival, he wore a plethora of glam-rock outfits (thanks to stylist Nicolò Cerioni) and toyed with a 1970s version of androgyny. In 2022, he remains far more interesting from a visual point of view than a musical one – but that’s exactly what Eurovision needs to drown out too many anthems with too many virtuoso warblers. Sigga, Beta & Elín are a sisterly trio with an established reputation in their country’s indie-pop and indie-folk scenes. The lyrics express the elation at the sense of renewal brought by the rising sun in a dark winter night, a prelude to spring – and while “it’s always darkest before the dawn” is a trite and meteorologically inaccurate trope, it’s quite nice in this corny context. The voices sound almost mystical and the melody is soothing. Indeed, it is so ethereal and twee that there’s actually something sinister, in a Midsommar way, about it, sparing this entry from being a snoozefest lullaby. This song, on the Mumfords/Lumineers axis of log-cabin strumalongs, is the musical equivalent of eating too many marshmallows from a campfire. Judging by rehearsals, Rosa Linn is staging her song in a bedroom with an all-white bed, comforter, armchair, plus walls decked in white Post-it notes, and indeed, it is about the whitest song imaginable. Fiddle, accordion and oompah make Moldova’s foot-thumping entry the ultimate crowd pleaser. I am a firm believer in the importance of some distinctly folk tunes in any Eurovision lineup, and Eurovision veterans Zdob și Zdub (sixth place in 2005, 12th place in 2011) deliver the goods by singing about a trenuleţul – a little train that goes from Chișinău to Bucharest. The lyrics are surprisingly wholesome, as they talk about the similarities and friendship between Moldova and Romania: “Both in this land and in that land we dance the hora, it’s a bliss!” Pure 80s dad rock with echoes of Meat Loaf and hints of Blondie’s One Way or Another. People might call it outdated and out of place; it could be one of this year’s most hated entries. Yet leather-clad rocking and pyro is an eternal part of Eurovision, and of course Måneskin won the contest last year with this approach, admittedly with a great deal more pomp and sexuality. Avicii meets Ennio Morricone (those whistles!) in this seemingly upbeat country romp, with a soulful verse and anthemic chorus – they preach the importance of standing tall, not losing one’s pride and holding on to the promise of the future – sung by Stefan in a versatile baritone. He is no Johnny Cash, but he manages to sing it in an entirely convincing manner. Offering a tribute to spaghetti westerns at a Eurovision hosted in Italy feels apt, and Eurovision’s Reddit nerds are calling this the dark horse of the year. Dressed like Kate Bush in Wuthering Heights, and bearing an uncanny resemblance to Lorde, Norwegian-Greek singer Amanda Georgiadi Tenfjord delivers an electro-tinged, Imogen-Heap-flavored ballad dealing with the aftermath of a relationship. As refined as the arrangement and the melody might be, the same cannot be said for the lyrics, which are prone to grandiose statements: “If we die together now, we will always have each other.” The bridge has a change of pace with a refined acoustic crescendo – but it too loses its mystique, with Tenfjord begging her former lover to “take my heart, rip it out / bring it to the other side”. Cynicism aside, this song does have great karaoke potential. A Hi-NRG banger we did not know we wanted, but that, amid that overabundance of ballads this year, we sorely need. Mixing Eurodisco and bubblegum pop at a breakneck pace that harks towards hardstyle, it is endearingly 90s-nostalgic – and thus fighting a much less desirable class of throwback, namely the 00s Snow Patrol-type ballads that once appeared on Grey’s Anatomy with dreary inevitability. This song will actually stand out and, despite lyrics that border on the nonsensical, it’s already a fan favourite, though said fans also worry about whether the live version will stand up to its studio original. Historically, Sweden has been a dominating force in Eurovision, and Cornelia Jakobs is expected to do very well: she is currently bookies’ third favourite after Ukraine and – yes, believe it – the UK. Hold Me Closer combines gritty vocals (think Taylor Swift at her saddest) with relatable lyrics and airtight production, somewhat reminiscent of the swells of Lady Gaga’s Shallow. Overall, it is a neat assembly-line number that I think is too anodyne to make a lasting impression, especially when up against the aforementioned championing of oral sex, health insurance etc. While the average millennial in lockdown was trying to master the art of sourdough, pick up a new language or half-ass a Joe Wicks workout, veteran session player Sam Ryder earned 12m TikTok followers by posting viral covers where his piercing vocal register caught the attention of Justin Bieber and others. His song, Space Man, has big astronaut boots to fill, filching celestial vibes from Elton John’s Rocket Man, the Beatles’ Across the Universe and REM’s Man on the Moon – but his strident chorus notes really hit you between the eyes. Will having a social-media-friendly entry help break a long streak of failure? It’s hard to say how much anti-Brexit sentiment has scuppered the UK and how much it’s because of a series of terrible songs – but Space Man is the best for many years.",Arts/Television & radio,"Sexy vegetables, banana-eating wolves and Meghan Markle’s hair: who to watch at Eurovision 2022",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/10/sexy-vegetables-banana-eating-wolves-and-meghan-markles-hair-who-to-watch-at-eurovision-2022
5/10/2022,"The New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, has defied criticisms of the state’s anti-corruption watchdog by the prime minister, announcing a boost in funding to the body. On Tuesday, Perrottet told parliament of the change in the way funding will be provided for the Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac), after meeting with the heads of the state’s key integrity bodies. But the premier said the new arrangements were “not completely in line” with the model requested by the Icac, which would have separated its funding from ministerial decision-making processes. The announcement came just hours after Scott Morrison defended his characterisation of the Icac as a “kangaroo court” that had “destroyed people’s reputations and careers before it’s even made a finding”. Last week Perrottet agreed that Morrison had “absolutely” gone too far in his criticisms. Perrottet indicated the Icac would receive a funding boost in next month’s budget, saying the changes would “better reflect current and future resourcing needs”. He also committed to a “re-baselining” of the agency’s budget in 2023. “I believe this strikes the right balance, I accept that it is not completely in line in terms of from the Icac’s perspective in relation to the model that they proposed,” Perrottet said on Tuesday. In recent years the Icac has been forced to ask the government for additional funding in order to hold public inquiries, a situation which leading Sydney barrister Bret Walker SC warned was potentially unlawful. “With the best will in the world, the senior public officials engaged in the dealings made necessary by the current arrangements for funding Icac cannot avoid a substantial risk of appearing to be capable of exerting, by the power of the purse string, inappropriate influence over Icac’s operations from time to time,” Walker said in advice to the Icac in 2020. Perrottet said the new funding model would “deal with the issues that they have raised substantively”. “We’ve come up with what we believe is a model for the integrity agencies that fundamentally addresses the concerns that they have raised,” he said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “We have now gone back and raised the new model with the integrity agencies and I can inform you today that the changes are that we will make, the majority of them will come into place in terms of the funding model for this year’s budget.”Funding for the state’s key integrity agencies has been a subject of contention in NSW since former watchdog chief commissioner Peter Hall told a 2019 inquiry that funding cuts proposed by the government would leave the agency with a $4m shortfall that would have an “immediate and serious” effect on its ability to fight corruption. After the comments, former premier Gladys Berejiklian tasked the Auditor General with conducting a review of the Icac’s funding model which found the independence of the body was threatened because politicians sign off on its funding. Perrottet said key integrity agencies including the Icac, the NSW Auditor General and the NSW Electoral Commission, would be exempt from efficiency dividends imposed on other government departments, and committed to “provide reasons” for variations in the agencies budgets. He outlined a new funding process for the integrity agencies that will give the treasurer responsibility for informing the agencies about funding decisions. In cases where there are any cuts to the agency’s budget, the government will “provide an explanation as to why and that will be transparent for the committee and for the public”. The Greens anti-corruption spokesperson, Jamie Parker, welcomed the funding increase, but said the government’s announcement failed the “fundamental test” set by the Icac in its request for a funding overhaul. “Decisions about funding will be more at arm’s length but they won’t be fully out of the reach of the government of the day,” he said. “The parliament should determine the commission’s funding and not the executive government. These changes don’t resolve that basic conflict of interest.”",News/Australia news,NSW government to boost funding to Icac despite Scott Morrison’s criticisms of watchdog,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/10/nsw-government-to-boost-funding-to-icac-despite-scott-morrisons-criticisms-of-watchdog
5/10/2022,"The illegal sale of donkey skins is thriving in online marketplaces, with traders openly flouting local laws, and social media multinationals such as Facebook doing little to prevent the illegal trade, according to a new investigation. Traders on Facebook are offering large quantities of donkey skins on the site, the report said, including one trader in Kenya, where the trade is effectively banned, who listed 2,000 for immediate sale. The report found large numbers of sellers in countries that have bans on the donkey skin trade, including Kenya, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Senegal and Ghana. In its report, the Donkey Sanctuary charity said traders promoted the sale of donkey skins on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Instagram. It said the algorithms used by social media companies made it easy for buyers to find sellers. An estimated 4.8 million donkeys are killed for the trade every year, according to the report, a demand partly sustained by raids on farmers who depend on the animals for their livelihoods. The trafficking feeds a rising demand for ejiao, a traditional Chinese remedy that uses donkey skins to produce a form of gelatine. Despite only 20 countries having deals to legally trade donkey skins with China, skins arrive there from more than 50 countries, says the charity. The report, published on Sunday, is the first to reveal the scale of the trade, which is entangled with organised crime syndicates, international drug trafficking and the illegal trade in endangered animals and animal parts. Investigators for the charity found 382 traders who sold donkey skins and other trafficked wildlife on e-commerce sites, some of whom also sold drugs, human hair and fake passports. The report said some traders also operated on the dark web, and many used established drug-trafficking networks to transport the hides. In cases where exporting donkey skins was legal, the report found the goods were bundled with other illegal wildlife items, or illegal drugs. It also said websites were failing to clamp down on the illegal trade, despite it being clear from listings that sellers were aware of the laws, with many promising to package the hides carefully to avoid detection. Marianne Steele, the charity’s acting CEO, said: “By cracking down on the sale of donkey skins on their platforms, e-commerce and social media [firms] will not only prevent considerable cruelty, but also help eliminate the other criminal activity that is taking place alongside it.” In an accompanying study on the link between the donkey trade and global wildlife trafficking, the University of Oxford’s Saïd Business School and Wildlife Conservation Research Unit found 15,000 items for sale on seven websites, alongside postings offering 13 endangered species. “Our work brings together concerns about wildlife conservation, animal welfare and the wellbeing of some of the world’s poorest communities, all around the unexpected focal point of donkeys,” said Dr Ewan Macdonald, postdoctoral research fellow at Saïd Business School. Macdonald said 20% of traders also sold other trafficked wildlife products, including pangolin scales and elephant ivory. Last month, campaign group Avaaz said it had documented a thriving marketplace for wildlife trafficking on Facebook, finding tiger cubs, leopards, ocelots, African grey parrots and the pygmy marmoset, the world’s smallest monkey. In response to the Avaaz report, Facebook’s parent company, Meta, questioned the validity of the study’s methodology and sample size, and said the results did not reflect the work they had done to combat wildlife trafficking, including removing content and launching strategies to discourage people from participating in the trade. “This is an adversarial space though, and the people behind this awful activity are persistent and constantly evolving their tactics to try and evade these efforts,” said a spokesperson. Meta did not respond to the claims made in the Donkey Sanctuary report about the use of its platform for the sale of donkey skins in countries where it is illegal.",News/Global development,"Illegal donkey-skin trade thriving on social networks, report reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/may/10/donkey-skin-trade-thriving-on-social-networks-report-reveals
5/10/2022,"Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged the international community to take immediate steps to end a Russian blockade of his country’s ports in order to allow wheat shipments and prevent a global food crisis. After the Black Sea port of Odesa was struck by missiles on Monday, Zelenskiy said: “For the first time in decades there is no usual movement of the merchant fleet, no usual port functioning in Odesa. Probably this has never happened in Odesa since world war two. “Without our agricultural exports, dozens of countries in different parts of the world are already on the brink of food shortages. And over time, the situation can become downright terrible … This is a direct consequence of Russian aggression, which can be overcome only together – by all Europeans, by the whole free world.” One person was killed and five injured when seven missiles hit a shopping centre and a depot in Odesa, Ukraine’s armed forces said. Air raid sirens sounded as the missiles interrupted a meeting between Charles Michel, president of the European Council, and the Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, forcing them into a bomb shelter. Michel said he saw silos full of grain, wheat and corn unable to be exported. “This badly needed food is stranded because of the Russian war and blockade of Black Sea ports, causing dramatic consequences for vulnerable countries,” he said. “We need a global response.” There was no let-up in fighting elsewhere, with Russian strikes on targets in the east and south and a renewed push by Kremlin’s forces to defeat the last Ukrainian troops holding out in a steelworks in ruined Mariupol. At least 100 civilians remained trapped in the plant, which remained under heavy Russian fire, an aide to the Mariupol mayor said on Tuesday. Full control of the city would allow Moscow to create a land bridge between the Crimean peninsula, which it annexed in 2014, and eastern regions run by pro-Russian separatists. Air raid sirens could be heard across several regions of Ukraine early on Tuesday, including in Luhansk, Kharkiv and Dnipro. The governor of Luhansk reported “very serious battles” in the frontline areas of Bilogorivka and Rubizhne. In the town of Bogodukhov, north-west of Kharkiv, four people were killed and several homes were destroyed in Russian attacks on Monday, local media quoted Kharkiv officials as saying. In the US, congressional Democrats have reportedly agreed to provide as soon as Tuesday a further $39.8bn in additional aid for Ukraine, exceeding president Joe Biden’s request last month for $33bn including more than $20bn in military assistance. Senate leaders were prepared to move quickly to enact the proposal, reports said, which includes an additional $3.4bn for military aid and $3.4bn in humanitarian aid. Biden said: “This aid has been critical to Ukraine’s success on the battlefield. We cannot allow our shipments of assistance to stop while we await further congressional action. A bill that Biden signed into law on Monday allows quicker supply of military equipment to Ukraine. Before signing the bill, the US president said “Putin’s war” was “once more bringing wanton destruction of Europe”, drawing reference to the significance of Victory Day. “It really matters,” Biden said of the bipartisan support for Ukraine. One of the bill’s chief Republican sponsors, Senator John Cornyn of Texas, said: “I’m glad America could act as the arsenal of democracy for this critical partner.” On Monday, Vladimir Putin used Victory in Europe Day – the anniversary of Germany’s unconditional surrender in 1945, and Russia’s biggest patriotic holiday – to rally his people behind the invasion. The White House dismissed the Russian president’s speech as “revisionist history” and said his suggestion that western aggression led to the Ukraine war was “patently absurd”. In another attempt to pile pressure on Russia, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said she had made “progress” on a proposed Russian oil embargo during talks with the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, one of Putin’s closest allies in Europe, who has held up EU attempts to phase out Russian oil. In other developments: The US cited “anecdotal reports” that some Russian troops in Ukraine were not obeying orders. It said “mid-grade officers at various levels, even up to the battalion level” were refusing to move forward in the Donbas offensive. The UN human rights council is due to hold a special session on Thursday to address alleged Russian human rights violations during its war in Ukraine. More than 50 countries, including Britain, Germany, Turkey and the US, backed a request by Ukraine and demanded an extraordinary meeting of the UN’s top rights body.

5/10/2022,"For decades, South Korea’s presidents have begun their terms in office by acquainting themselves with the vast premises of the Blue House. But on Tuesday, Yoon Suk-yeol became the first leader in the country’s modern history to shun the presidential residence, heading instead to a new office inside a former defence ministry building in central Seoul. Yoon, who has styled himself as the “people’s president”, caused consternation when he said he had no intention of following his predecessors into the Blue House, so named because of the colour of its roof. He said the building, located at the foot of a mountain on a site once used by the Japanese during their 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean peninsula, was a “symbol of imperial power” that would be opened to the public as a sign of his commitment to a more open and democratic presidency. Successive South Korean presidents have lived and worked there since the country became a republic in 1948. The gesture has not been well received, however. His predecessor, Moon Jae-in, criticised the move as hasty and a potential security threat, while even some of his conservative supporters questioned the decision – estimated to have cost $40m – at a time when Yoon should be focusing on the economy and North Korea. Yoon, 61, has been forced to deny that he and his wife had decided to live elsewhere on the advice of shamanistic healers, whose shady role in South Korean politics became an issue during the election campaign. Yoon said the theory had been cooked up by his political opponents to discredit him. “The Democratic party seems to be more interested in shamans than I am,” he told reporters after his election victory on 9 March, adding that he had considered several locations for his new office and residence. He had come under scrutiny over claims that spiritual advisers introduced by his wife, Kim Kun-hee, had exerted influenced over his campaign. Kim, 49, had told a YouTube channel that she was a “spiritual person” who preferred meaningful discussions with gurus to visiting nightclubs, according to the Yonhap news agency. Yoon also denied that he had frequented an anal acupuncturist. There was speculation that Yoon was determined to avoid the Blue House “curse” that had befallen several of his predecessors, including the dictator Park Chung-hee, who was assassinated in the building’s grounds in 1979, and his daughter, Park Geun-hye, who was impeached and imprisoned for corruption in 2017. As Yoon was being sworn in on Tuesday, members of the public who had drawn lots to visit the Blue House were divided over his decision. “It feels surreal,” Hwang Jin-woo, who works for a construction company, told the Guardian outside the building, whose grounds will be turned into a public park. “Since I was young, this place has been a symbol of power. Until yesterday, it was a symbol of power, but now the public can access it. I was born a few decades ago, at a time when I couldn’t even take a glimpse at this place. But suddenly it’s been given to the citizens, so it’s a little overwhelming.” Lee Jin-ok, who was visiting from Suwon, near Seoul, agreed. “I think it’s really great that it has returned to the arms of the people,” she said. “It has a lot of cultural value and I have always thought that the Blue House is one of the most beautiful buildings in Korea. I hope people will come here and enjoy themselves while learning about the history of Korea and its past presidents.” But Kim Moon-soo, an office worker, said he was not sure if the millions of dollars used to set up Yoon’s new office had been money well spent. “I think it was a bit of an act to show that he is keeping his promise from day one,” Kim said. “At the same time, I hope he keeps his other promises and takes good care of the country during these challenging times.”",News/World news,Claims of shamans and curses as South Korea’s president shuns official residence,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/10/claims-of-shamans-and-curses-as-south-koreas-president-shuns-official-residence
