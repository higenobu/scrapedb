1/1/2022,"In 2019, the UN named Finland the happiest place in the world, and Manuel Vazquez and journalist Ana Alfageme were sent by a Spanish magazine to find out why. Saunas are a big part of life there; the country has more than 2 million in residential and public settings. The pair agreed that they’d be good places to find locals to interview.  This photo was taken on a sub-zero November day, when only six hours of light can be expected. The pair had already tried out a swanky coastal sauna. “I didn’t think I’d be able to do it,” Vazquez laughs. “But it really does liberate the endorphins. It’s exhilarating.” Next, Vazquez wanted to seek out a more authentic, traditional version that used wood. He had heard of a particularly popular one in the Helsinki neighbourhood of Kallio. “In winter, the practice is to alternate between the sauna and a body of water, like a lake or the sea,” he says. “But because this sauna is in the city, patrons just go and sit on the icy street.” Vazquez was drawn to the retro neon sign, the way the red light tinted the wet ground, and the myriad details. “They create a narrative, tell a story. The empty chairs next to the men seem to be inviting you to sit with them. “I intended to shoot properly with my digital camera, but first I quickly took this on my Pixel 3, almost like a test shot. Then we went over to break the ice.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘Sauna patrons just sit on the icy street’: Manuel Vazquez’s best phone picture,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/01/sauna-patrons-sit-on-icy-street-manuel-vazquez-best-phone-picture
1/1/2022,"Trying to learn AP physics over Zoom. Cancelled standardized tests. The end of Ds and Fs. Masked proms with no slow dancing. While Covid undeniably changed the world for everyone, one place that was truly upended was high school. What started as a short break from in-person class has now affected three different school years. Some changes have been hard: hybrid schedules, masking through eight-hour days, suspended extracurriculars. But the drastic changes have also posed the question: what else could be possible? Could school be more fun, inclusive, different?  Here, six seniors across the US offer their best ideas on how high school could be better. I have cerebral palsy, and I use a wheelchair. At my school, awareness about special needs has grown. But still, some things aren’t accessible. I can get into every classroom on campus, but in some, I can only access the front right corner. At lunch, there are tables that fit my chair, but only some of them, and if my friends don’t sit at one of those, I can’t join them. Honestly, it’s kind of upsetting. I have an outgoing personality, and I like to talk to people. But most of the time, I eat lunch by myself. It’s really important for schools to be inclusive, because they can open up a whole new world for students in wheelchairs. At my school, we have a wheelchair basketball team, and when our team plays a home game, we can fill one side of the bleachers. After we were runners-up at the state championship, the mayor shut down the traffic circle in Tallmadge and gave us a police and fire escort on our way back. It made us feel happy, special and a part of the community. People recognized our accomplishments! I’m also the manager for the football team. I go out and shake hands with the other players, and hang out in the locker room. Being part of the team has been really helpful for making friends. Everyone knows me. We joke that I could be the next mayor of Tallmadge. High schools need to make sure a special needs student is part of the committee preparing for homecoming and prom. This year, I’ll be able to go to graduation because my school moved it to a football stadium with a ramp, which the old location didn’t have. My goal is to walk across it with my walker, not in my chair. Most of my classmates and teachers have only ever seen me in my chair, so their minds will be blown away when I start walking. I don’t think high schools should push college as much as they do. The college route isn’t always the right one. A lot of people don’t have the finances to pay for school and won’t be able to afford the debt. But the program I’m in, it’s free. I believe it’s going to help me with my future. I was going to a regular school my freshman and sophomore years. I thought it would be just like middle school, but I got a rude awakening. My grades weren’t the best, and I didn’t have a relationship with my teachers. I was ashamed to ask questions. One day, my mom got an email about career and technical education programs. I did my research, andapplied to the program. Now, I love school. I’m really good with hands-on things – working with tools and knowing how things work. I want to be great at my craft. That’s what I stand for. I have now learned how to braze copper pipes. I have an internship at a heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) supply store. I’ve been there about a month and a half, and I have to learn all of the parts, so I can help customers. I’m on track to graduate in the spring, and I want to join the union – Steamfitters 602. I’ll be working and going to school at night, two nights a week, 15 Saturdays per year. You go to college, you do your four years and then you graduate, but you still have to find a job. With this program, I’ll get a job like that. I’ll get a fair shot at providing for my family straight out of high school. Eventually, I want to start my own business. But right now, they’re teaching me how to do the work. There are 15 people in my class, and it feels like a family. Schools should really consider starting later and offering more flexible schedules. Students will have more downtime, and be more focused when they get to campus. I’m an extrovert, and I did not like doing online school. But I’m also self motivated, and I was able to create my own schedule, so I could do the things I like – like yoga – during the school day. I feel like I grew up a lot during that time. Having school start at 8.05am again this year was rough. I get up at 5.30, but I’m really busy, so it limited what I could get done before class. Lots of my friends sleep until the very last minute and roll out of bed and come to school without even brushing their hair. Even an extra half hour would have made the adjustment easier. Going back to school and having to ask to use the restroom also felt odd. My friends were feeling it, too. I work in an after-school program. During quarantine, a lot of kids got jobs during the day, and did school work late at night. One friend of mine works at Starbucks. His school lets him take a free period first period of the day, and he works from 4.30 until 7.30am, then goes to school I’m the child of a single mother who is an immigrant. My mom only got a middle school education, and when she came to the US, she got a job cleaning houses so I could pursue a better life. I always thought higher education wasn’t an option for me. But programs at school have made me realize it is possible. Right now, I’m one of the 10 students sharing my input and my experiences within the public school system to help create an intensive, one-year program for students at different high schools in San Francisco looking to get into Stem-focused careers called the Mission Bay Hub. We’re hoping it will offer tools and equipment that actual scientists use. I’ve told them that it’s really important to have a big open space, because many of our classrooms are cramped. When volunteers come into the hub, they should be a diverse and representative group – like us. Honestly, being part of the program feels awesome – I feel like I’m doing something positive for my younger siblings and cousins in this system. I feel like I’m creating a change in our education. Schools should allow students to meet with the principal and board members, instead of having one-minute, once a month opportunities. Last year, I started community college classes during high school. Next spring, I’ll graduate from community college three weeks before I graduate from high school, with 62 hours of college credit. The state of Oklahoma covers a lot of the tuition for concurrent enrollment students. And the Creek Nation, which I’m a member of, covered most of the rest. My mom estimates that my parents paid for the cost of a couple of books – that’s it. Everyone should have opportunity to study the same way I did. It helps students become familiar with the college application process, how to navigate the different departments at college, and the difference between high school and college classes. In high school, you’re with this same group of kids, and the teacher is pushing you to do your work. In college, it’s all on you. I have a head start on my future. I should graduate in two and a half years – and save my parents about $50,000. It prepares students for college, and is a huge self esteem booster. I look at it and think, “I did that.” A lot of kids my age don’t even know how to sew on a button. If I were going to change high school, I would make sure that students learn the basic life skills you need outside of school. Personally, I don’t know anything about cars. Something happened to my tire when I was at school, and my boyfriend and I had to call another friend to show us how to change it. So I’d make the first quarter of the class automotive – how to check your oil and your coolant, change a tire – things like that. In the second quarter, you could teach students how to cook from scratch. It’s cheaper than fast food, healthier too. And I would know. One of my three jobs is working at McDonald’s as a shift leader. I’ve been a member of a youth organization called Future Farmers of America that prepares students for careers in agriculture since I was a freshman, and it has had a huge impact on my life. Now, I know different breeds of pigs and cattle, and what they’re all for. The third quarter would focus on sewing. I only learned how to sew recently when I made masks with my grandma during the pandemic. I don’t want to have to pay a fee every time I want to get something fixed. The fourth quarter would be more about financial literacy, and setting up a savings account. My freshman year, a teacher taught us how to write a check. But here I am about to graduate, and that’s as far as I’ve gotten.",News/Education,"After three years of chaos, six US teens tell us how school could be different",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/01/us-high-school-covid-pandemic-how-to-change
1/1/2022,"I’m a literary agent and at the height of last year’s Black Lives Matter protests I was sent a list, with accompanying photographs, of the top editors working across the major publishing houses in the UK. When I read it I burst into tears. It showed a sea of almost totally white faces, some of whom had been approaching retirement when I started out as an editorial assistant 20 years earlier. The stagnation in the industry was stark and filled me with despair. Analysis of the industry since then, partly led by pressure from BLM and an open letter from the Black Writers Guild, has only further highlighted this imbalance. Two of the biggest global publishers, Penguin Random House and Hachette, revealed that just 2.7% of their staff – in both cases – are black; and the Guardian reported that you are eight times more likely to see an animal as lead character in a children’s book than a person of colour.  In a modern, multicultural nation, the whiteness of the industry matters. This summer, the bestselling author Kate Clanchy chose to rewrite her memoir after an outcry over her portrayal of minority-ethnic children. Her book, Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me, used racialised terminology such as “chocolate-coloured skin”, it referred to one student as “African Jonathon”, a Somali child as having a “narrow skull” and described another as being “so small and square and Afghan with his big nose and premature moustache”. I’ve sat in weekly new business meetings across three of the five major publishing houses week in week out for decades, invariably surrounded by all-white teams who between them not only decide what should and shouldn’t be published but also give final signoff to books before they’re printed. For me, and other people of colour in the industry, this was the moment we’ve been sounding the alarm bell about for years. The furore about Clanchy on social media left me astonished. I watched in horror as posters argued ferociously over whether it’s OK or not to comment on the shape of a black child’s skull. People raged, asking how Clanchy’s use of language could have been published. For me, the answer could be found easily in that white-dominated editors’ list, and the fact that, for years, loud and growing calls to diversify its teams have been pretty much ignored. No wonder the industry today finds itself in a complete mess on race. There is a crippling and toxic silence around everyday racism and how it manifests in the media: erasure, sidelining, stunting of careers, the sheer mental exhaustion of operating daily in a predominantly white space and the routine grind of being marginalised. A couple of years ago I left one of the major publishers and now work from my two-up two-down in Wales, supporting talent behind the scenes. I focused instead on agenting David Harewood’s memoir and its important, groundbreaking discussion of black mental health. And I worked with Lenny Henry on his first novel for children, about a black child who is able to fly – helping to address that lack of black lead characters. I empathise with Vanessa Kingori, the black chief business officer at Condé Nast, who says that when she joined Vogue at the same time as editor-in-chief Edward Enninful, their joint aspiration “was always to normalise the marginalised”. Meanwhile, I’ve observed within publishing the increasing mention and use of “sensitivity readers”. What on earth are they, you might ask. Essentially a little freelance cottage industry of marginalised folk has sprung up, post-Clanchy, to check that books aren’t racist, disablist or any other -ist before they’re sent to print. What this means is that the predominantly white editors commissioning and publishing books featuring characters from diverse backgrounds are now checking these books with readers from these backgrounds in order to ensure publication does not cause accidental offence. And backlist titles, too, are being rethought – a recent example being that of an east Asian character from David Walliams’ The World’s Worst Children. It is now published without the character Brian Wong, Who Was Never, Ever Wrong, following a complaint from a reader who had picked up on the way Brian had been illustrated, wearing glasses and with “small eyes”. But, for me, “sensitivity readers” are an inadequate, sticking-plaster solution. Why use freelancers when you could actually fully employ commissioning editors and publishers of all backgrounds? Shouldn’t there be enough diversity within the industry itself to ensure work can be properly checked for sensitivity? Given the industry seems incapable of this, perhaps it needs an independent body to advise it on equality and monitor progress. As a black, straight woman who commissioned and edited a memoir by a white, gay man (that sold more than 450,000 copies with not a sensitivity reader in sight), I’d say that we have far more in common as human beings than differences. I don’t feel like a minority: there are lots of people around the world who look like me. Sharing all of our stories with respect and sensitivity really shouldn’t be this hard.

1/1/2022,"Bold to the nth degree? Perhaps. Bonkers? Absolutely not. Dan Campbell’s squad has a lot of positives to build on heading into next season beyond the stunning win over Arizona. Detroit’s stellar offensive line returns all five starters next year. Jared Goff has settled in and should be a serviceable stopgap, allowing the Lions to spend their (probable) No 2 draft pick on a stud pass rusher or wideout. And Campbell, for all his game management flaws, has a roster that has fully bought into his culture shift. When Aaron Rodgers leaves for Denver or retires and the Bears muff their coaching hire and the Vikings underperform, the rapidly improving Lions will be ready to pounce. MJ  Canada haven’t even come close to qualifying for the World Cup since their first and only appearance back in 1986. That will change this year – they’re currently top of the Concacaf octagonal after going eight games unbeaten – owing to a glut of young stars who have developed into major contributors at European clubs, among them Champions League medal-holder Alphonso Davies (Bayern Munich), Jonathan David (Lille), Cyle Larin (Besiktas) and Tajon Buchanan (Club Brugge). As ever, so much is down to the draw. But if John Herdman’s side can manage to avoid a true group of death, look for Canada make it out of pool play and match Costa Rica’s Concacaf coming-out of eight years ago. BAG It took a few decades, but F1 finally figured out the most direct path into an American TV viewer’s heart is through soapy drama. The messier, the better. Netflix’s Drive to Survive docuseries hooked us on these foreign characters, their base desires and the frustrating obstacles in between – to the point that the idea of missing a race (let alone qualifying or a practice session) would be like watching a season of the Real Housewives without also tuning into the reunion shows. The Abu Dhabi finale had an audience of a million, and its controversial ending (I’ll say it again: Lewis Hamilton was robbed) will go down as the sport’s Who Shot JR moment. Which is to say everyone and their mother will be tuning in mid-March to see how this cliffhanger resolves. While a million viewers might not sound like much compared to the NFL, that’s about half the audience for Nascar, the US’s most-watched motorsport, and their ratings have been in free fall for years. This year’s US Grand Prix attracted more than 400,000 people to Austin for the race weekend. Next spring a second USGP race comes to the streets of Miami, maybe the most F1 American city there is. (It has the glamor, the international flavor, the speed culture and a coastline that will look sumptuous in aerial shots.) To put it in terms a new F1 might understand: Nascar might be in the lead, but F1’s following close behind and about to enter the DRS zone. To put it even more plainly: I live in Nascar country, but more and more I find myself skidding into coffee shop conversations about Hamilton’s pet bulldog Roscoe or Lando Norris’s Twitch channel. Face it, Formula 1 is on the march. The only question is how long before it pulls away from Nascar for good. AL Instead of consolidating his place at the top of the sport after his maiden US Open title in 2020, this season was the nadir of Dominic Thiem’s career. After mental burnout early in the year, he suffered a serious wrist injury in June, had a major setback in August and then his comeback timeline was recently ruined by a cold. It will take a considerable amount time for Thiem to regain his form and trademark intensity, but he will finish 2022 back amongst the best. TC The NFL adding a 17th regular-season game was always a stopping point on the way to the much-desired 18th game. Pair that with the fact the league recently announced international marketing areas for 18 teams in 26 different markets across eight countries – an announcement that was light on details but large on marketing ease – and it’s not difficult to see the eventual blueprint: an international round (or a weekly individual game) played in each of those respective markets. Asking teams to travel and forfeit a home game has always been a sticking point for the league’s international series, making it tricky to consistently send some of the league’s most popular franchises to games held in London, Mexico City or Canada. The new marketing agreement adds Australia, Brazil, China, Germany and Spain to the league’s formal international agreements. With retirement nearing for commissioner Roger Goodell, it’s easy to foresee a proposal similar to the Premier League’s infamous 39th game serving as a legacy plan. OC Unbeknownst to many sports pundits, soccer federations are responsible for building the game in all its forms, from the grassroots upward, not just paying the men’s and women’s able-bodied full-field World Cup teams. The women’s team should have settled its “equal pay” dispute years ago but persists in pushing forward in court, where its case is flawed. The men’s team has paid lip service to “equal pay”, but the federation has called its bluff by insisting upon some way to figure out how to disperse World Cup prize money that’s far greater for men than for women – to Fifa’s disgrace. (Other countries have “equal pay” by offering the teams equal percentages of World Cup prize money, a solution that would make the US women’s team laugh.) These teams will reach a point at which they can’t just play on the sympathies of the misinformed, and they’ll end up negotiating from a position of weakness. BD Compared to his peers, Adam Silver has had a relatively uncontroversial reign as NBA commissioner, however, his obsession with shortening the regular season in place of an in-season tournament feels like an all-time example of a person with power attempting to fix the unbroken. While recently leaked news suggests that opposition to the play-in tournament is lowering, it wouldn’t be at all surprising for there to be swift backlash, either from the players’ union, the owners or both. 2022 could very well bring us the most significant defeat of Silver’s tenure.

1/1/2022,"A battle is brewing in SW19. Local residents, environmental and heritage groups are preparing to launch a public relations and legal salvo against Wimbledon’s plans to develop historic Capability Brown parkland into 39 new tennis courts for the championships. The campaigners claim the All England Lawn Tennis Club’s (AELTC) designs for a new 8,000-seat show court and 38 other grass courts on a golf course next to the world-famous SW19 club breaches a covenant that prevents building on the Grade II* listed parkland.  When it bought the freehold of the golf course from Merton borough council for £5.2m in 1993, the All England club agreed to a legal covenant “preventing the use of the land otherwise than for leisure or recreation purposes or as an open space”. Despite the covenant, the All England club has submitted plans to Merton and Wandsworth councils for a 95-metre long, 28-metre high 8,000-seat “Parkland show court” on the land designed by Capability Brown for the first Earl Spencer in 1768. The club says it needs to build the new show court on the protected parkland because there is not enough space on its current site, and it urgently requires higher capacity courts to compete with the other grand slam tournaments. The club has promised the campaigners, who number in their thousands and include several prominent London lawyers, that the show court will be “a world-class building matching the beauty of its surroundings and paying tribute to the site’s rich history”. The plans, which the club said would enhance its “tennis in an English garden” image, also include 38 ground courts, several ancillary buildings and 9.4km of roads and paths. More than 1,200 people have submitted formal objections via the councils’ websites. Ahead of a planning decision expected in the spring, several local residents associations, heritage and environmental groups, and local politicians are forming a “non-political umbrella group” to begin a public and legal fight against the All England club’s plan. Chris Baker, director of the Capability Brown Society, said the plans would “destroy forever” land laid out by Brown 240 years ago. “This act of desecration will be a savage act of vandalism by the All England – who claim to have ‘heritage is in our DNA’,” Baker said. Baker said the coalition of interest groups aimed to “first fight the All England in the court of public opinion”, but has also asked lawyers to prepare for a legal battle over the status of the covenant if planning permission is granted. “The All England were good neighbours, but local opinion is fast turning against them,” Baker said. “The great majority of locals are scared to death that they are going to wreck the park. They are interested in only one thing and that is revenue and the extra income their new developments on the golf course will generate.” Thelma Fry, 96, who has lived in a block of flats overlooking the park for 30 years, said she was “devastated and heartbroken” by the proposals. “I am just one person against the endless wealth and influence of All England Tennis,” Fry said. “As I grow older, my pleasure in life is ever more dependent on the view from my window. The trees, grass and lake of Capability Brown’s landscape. I am devastated and heartbroken that it will be ruined by the All England plans. “They have assured me it will take years to build, which means that for the remainder of my life, instead of my present glorious view I will overlook a building site.” Iain Simpson, chairman of Wimbledon Park Residents Association, which represents more than 10,000 local households, accused the All England club of deceiving local people by submitting plans that breach the covenant it signed promising not to build on the land when it bought it in 1993. Simpson dug out Merton’s minutes from when the council agreed to sell the golf club land on the condition that the All England signed a covenant promising “not to use it except for leisure or recreational purposes or as an open space and not to build on it”. At the time, the then-chairman of the All England club, John Curry, said: “We completely understand and support everyone’s determination to keep the land open and we have purchased the land on that basis.” Tony Colman, leader of Merton borough council, said: “This council is resolute that the land will be retained as open space. All England has bought the land knowing this is our policy and is aware that we would not allow development of the site.” When Simpson recently wrote to Ian Hewitt, the current All England chairman, reminding him of the covenant and his predecessor’s promise, Hewitt replied that: “I am sure you can appreciate that the requirements of the club and the community have developed in the resulting 28 years and that the AELTC has needed to work to ensure that the championships remain a pre-eminent tennis tournament and continue delivering significant and improved socioeconomic benefits to the local area.” “Residents and the public have been deceived about their intentions,” Simpson said in letter sent to thousands of local homes earlier this month. “Why should we believe anything they say?” In a statement, Hewitt said: “Private land covenants do not form part of the public planning process but are to be dealt with outside that process. The AELTC’s view is that it would be appropriate for any discussion/consideration in relation to the covenants to take place once the planning application has been determined.” Hewitt said the proposed new courts were “vital to the future of Wimbledon – to the hampionships, to the people of Wimbledon, and to tennis in the UK and globally. We need to deliver on these aspirations in order to maintain Wimbledon’s position at the pinnacle of the sport.” A spokesperson for Merton borough council said: “A legal covenant is not a material planning consideration in a planning application assessment. “The All England Lawn Tennis Club’s application is currently under assessment and it will likely be decided by the planning committee: as yet we don’t have a committee date in mind as the application is still under assessment by officers.” The All England club rented the land to Wimbledon Park Golf Club on a lease due to expire in 2041. However, eager to expand the championships and accommodate preliminary matches on site, the tennis club offered the golf club members £65m to buy out the lease and expand its footprint. The golf club members, who included Piers Morgan, Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, and former cabinet secretary Lord O’Donnell, voted in favour of the deal in 2018 and each collected a £85,000 windfall.",News/Business,Epic match beckons as Wimbledon locals take on tennis club expansion,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/01/epic-match-beckons-as-wimbledon-locals-take-on-tennis-club-expansion
1/1/2022,"The debate was ostensibly over a stop-gap spending bill that would avert a government shutdown. But Chip Roy, a Republican congressman from Texas, seized the opportunity to accuse Democrats of supporting “unconstitutional” vaccine mandates, critical race theory, “woke gender ideology” and open borders. A vote to fund the federal government, he warned, was a vote to allow “tyranny over the American citizen”. The speech infuriated congressman Tim Ryan, a Democrat from Ohio.  “Tyranny?” Ryan fumed on the House floor. “What are you people talking about? We’re talking about universal preschool, and they have it as a communist indoctrination of the American student. It’s insane.” Ryan’s frustration crystallized a dilemma for Democrats as they defend paper-thin majorities in Congress next year: how to talk about their legislative victories when Republicans are talking about everything else. Emboldened by a string of off-cycle electoral victories, Republicans are embracing the culture war battles that Donald Trump waged from the White House as a strategy for winning back control of the House and Senate in the 2022 midterm elections. “Lean into the culture war,” was the title of a June memo from the leader of the House Republican Study Committee, Indiana congressman Jim Banks. The “culture war” offensive comes as Democrats, facing deep economic malaise and historical headwinds, race to deliver on the president’s domestic agenda, which includes an ambitious social policy package that faces serious legislative hurdles, hampered by Democratic holdout senator Joe Manchin. “We have a plan to give you a better country, and they have a ploy to win back power for themselves,” said New York congressman Sean Patrick Maloney, chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “We are tackling the tough problems of the economy and the pandemic. They seek only to win power and will say or do anything to achieve that.” The party controlling the White House typically loses seats in the first midterm elections of a new presidency. With Biden’s plunging poll numbers, uncertainty over the centerpiece of his legislative agenda and Republicans’ redistricting edge, Democrats are increasingly dour about their chances. In the House, Democrats can only afford to lose a handful of seats; in the Senate they cannot afford to lose a single one. Maloney said selling their economic achievements – a popular, bipartisan infrastructure law and a poverty-reducing pandemic relief package – is critical for Democrats. But he said the party must also aggressively confront the Republican cultural assault. He urged Democrats to call out the opposition party’s embrace of “dangerous and reckless conduct,” which includes amplifying Trump’s false claims of a stolen election and downplaying the seriousness of the 6 January attack on the US capitol. On social issues, he believes that Republicans have pushed too far, particularly on the issue of abortion. As the supreme court considers whether to weaken or overturn the landmark Roe v Wade precedent, Democrats are loudly trumpeting their support for women’s reproductive rights, as they try portray Republicans as an increasingly extreme party determined to ban abortion. “We’re dealing with a Republican party that wants to ban abortion in all 50 states, bring back mass incarceration and burn books,” he added. “We’re not just going to respond, we’re going to be on offense.” Grievance politics is not a new strategy for Republicans. In 1968, Richard Nixon employed the “Southern Strategy” to exploit white racial grievances coded in language such as “law and order” and “states’ rights”. But as partisanship grows and the parties become increasingly hostile to one another, so too has the potential political benefit of cultural warfare that inflames division and energizes their base. A recent report by the Public Religion Research Institute and Brookings Institution, titled “competing visions of America,” found that 80% of Republicans believe that “America is in danger of losing its culture and identity”. By comparison, just 33% of Democrats agree. Meanwhile, 70% of Republicans say “American culture and way of life have changed for the worse since the 1950s” while more than six in 10 Democrats say it has changed for the better. As Democrats negotiate amongst themselves over how to pass Biden’s signature domestic policy bill, Republicans have been seeding outrage over – and fundraising off of – all manner of perceived injustices from cancel culture to Dr Seuss to the 1619 project. They are hammering the administration over its handling of immigration at the southern border and Democrats over rising crime rates in cities. And Biden’s efforts to pursue racial equity as part of his governing agenda has drawn accusations of racism from conservatives who say the efforts discriminate against white people. Republicans are also leading the charge against the administration’s vaccine mandates for companies with more than 100 employees, which they say is an example of “radical” Democratic overreach. On that issue, Republicans are speaking to their base, which is disproportionately unvaccinated. An NPR analysis found that the stronger a county’s support for Trump in the 2020 election, the lower its Covid-19 vaccination rate. But Republicans are betting that opposition to vaccine mandates, terms of personal liberty, will resonate beyond their base. In legal challenges to the mandates, Republican leaders argue that the vaccine mandates will worsen the nation’s supply chain problems and exacerbate labor shortages that have arisen during the pandemic. But with the omicron variant circulating, Democrats believe public sentiment is firmly behind them. Americans increasingly support vaccine mandates for workers, students, and in everyday public life, according to a recent CNN poll, which found 54% in favor of requiring vaccinations for employees returning to the office. The challenge for Republicans is to avoid alienating moderate voters in the suburbs with their efforts to energize their supporters who are deeply loyal to Trump and have come to expect their politicians to loudly voice their grievances. Republicans believe their unexpected success in Virginia, a state Biden won by 10 percentage points in 2020, provides a playbook. In November, Republican Glenn Youngkin won the race for Virginia governor after pledging to ban it from the state’s public schools. Democrats were surprised by the potency over culture war fight over education, allowing Youngkin to rev up the conservative base while appealing to suburban parents’ frustrations over Covid-19 school closures and masking protocols in classrooms. “It’s the oldest trick in the book,” said Anat Shenker-Osorio, a messaging expert and host of Words To Win By. “It’s creating some sort of an ‘other’ so that we don’t notice that they’re actually the cause of our problems.” In Virginia and elsewhere, she said Democrats were caught “flat-footed” by concerns over critical race theory, a concept that, until recently, few outside of academia had ever heard of. Instead of confronting it, she said Democrats’ instinct was to deny support and dismiss the charge as a right-wing talking point, neither of which satisfied voters. Democrats need “an explanation for the rightwing’s origin story of, ‘this is why you’re suffering white man in the post-industrial Midwest,” Shenker-Osorio said. “Unless we can talk about race, about gender, about gender identity, our economic promise isn’t going to land.” Columnist Will Bunch, writing in the Philadelphia Inquirer, put it another way: “Once again, the Democrats showed up to a culture war gunfight brandishing a 2,000-page piece of legislation.” While Democrats agree they have a problem, they are at odds over how to fix it. Some argue that the party has moved too far left on cultural issues, a shift that has alienated non-college educated white voters and, increasingly, working-class Latino and Black Americans. Another cohort believes that instead of trying to recapture the voters who have abandoned the party, Democrats should find a message that appeals to a diversifying electorate. Proponents of this approach believe Democrats should respond to the right’s attacks by adopting what they call a “race-class narrative”, which Shenker-Osorio helped develop. The approach explicitly accuses Republicans of using racism or racial dog whistles as a divide-and-conquer tactic to sew distrust, undermine faith in government and protect the wealthy. When applied, the message not only defangs Republican attacks, it motivates and mobilizes voters of all races, its advocates argue. “Our task is to make the idea of joining together across our differences – the idea of multiracial solidarity, as a means to collectively get these shared values that we all want – sexier than the grievance politics that the right is selling,” said Jenifer Fernandez Ancona, the co-founder and chief strategy officer of Way to Win. In a recently published memo, advocated candidates use the “blows are landing because our agenda and accomplishments remain so far undefined in the minds of voters”. Among its messaging recommendations, the group urges Democrats to contrast the party’s economic vision with a “Republican party that is beholden to Maga extremism” while doing more to sell their legislative achievements and highlight the steps they’ve taken to combat Covid. “The good news is that these are not insurmountable challenges,” the memo states. An increasingly vocal coterie of liberal critics believe the outlook is grimmer: that Democrats are staring into the political wilderness unless they are able to win back some of the non-college educated voters who abandoned the party. Ruy Teixeira, a demographer and election analyst, believes Democrats have moved too far left on social issues like crime and immigration and is in need of a complete rebrand. He said Trump’s gains with non-college educated Hispanic voters was a “real wake-up call” that Democrats need to change course. “We need a durable majority,” he said. “You can’t build a durable majority by ignoring socio-cultural concerns and the values of these huge swaths of the population.” Where Democrats agree is that they must deliver on their promises while in power. “We’re really just at the beginning of what needs to be a substantial change in the way the American economic model works,” Teixeira said. “And to do that, it’s not enough to just win one election and pass some stuff. We need to win a number of elections and pass even more stuff … It’s not much more complicated than that.”",News/US news,"Republicans aim to sow outrage, Trump-style, with an eye on 2022 midterms",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/01/republicans-sow-outrage-trump-style-2022-midterms-house-senate
