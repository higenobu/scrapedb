5/3/2022,"By Kantaro Komiya and Kentaro Sugiyama TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese mother of three Maiko Takahashi was never one to pinch pennies or accept hand-me-downs for her children even though circumstances for her single-income family have always been fairly modest. But times have changed. Nowadays, she has no trouble with used clothes and her pursuit of bargains and scrimping on the most trifling costs borders on the obsessive. ""I've started to pay close attention to tips on TV shows, like minimising the number of times you open the fridge to save electricity,"" said Takahashi, whose family of five lives in suburbs north of Tokyo. ""We've started to feel the pinch going about things the usual way so I've made adjustments."" Takahashi's behaviour is mirrored by a growing number of consumers and underlines a worrying trend for Japan. After lifting two years of on-and-off coronavirus curbs in March, the government was counting on what's known as ""revenge spending"", pent-up demand triggering a splurge that boosts consumption and a moribund economy, as has been seen in the United States, China and some other major economies. But with energy, food and other living costs soaring - exacerbated in recent months by a sharp decline in the yen and the war in Ukraine - those hopes are fading fast. Facing the prospect of struggling with rising prices, Japan's famously thrifty consumers are tightening their belts even as they sit on the remains of an estimated 50 trillion yen ($383 billion) - equivalent to 9% of the economy - in ""forced savings"", as the Bank of Japan calls it, accrued during the pandemic. Some bigger companies have answered a government call to raise wages but the gains of some 2% will be swallowed up by higher prices of everything from flour, to diapers and beer, economists say. In March, electricity prices in resources-poor Japan jumped 22% from the previous year - the most in more than four decades. The government recently upgraded its assessment of the economy for the first time in four months, citing an expected recovery in spending, but added a caveat that the outlook was clouded. ""The chance of a 'revenge spending' burst is becoming smaller than we had expected,"" a government official said in unusually candid remarks, noting that prospects were especially uncertain beyond the summer. FINAL FEAST With more than 90% of consumers saying in the latest government survey that they expected everyday goods to become more expensive over the next 12 months, economists say it is no surprise to see behaviour like Takahashi's. In addition to accepting used uniforms for her son entering kindergarten, and venturing further in search of discounts, the stay-at-home-mum said she has switched to lower-cost private brands (PB) for mayonnaise, ketchup and other food. She's not alone. The share of so-called PB items for mayonnaise purchases nationwide rose to 22% in March from 18% a year earlier, according to market research firm Intage Inc. Supermarket giant Aeon Co saw PB food sales jump 15% in the six months to February. The ""Golden Week"" holiday, which began on Friday, is the first in three years without COVID-19 restrictions, and the economy should see a dramatic improvement in spending but that is likely to be the high point for consumption this year, said Daiwa Securities senior economist Toru Suehiro. ""The full-fledged impact of rising costs will emerge in the July-September quarter and later, so the Golden Week will probably be the last feast of the year,"" he said. The number of holiday travellers is expected to grow about 70% from last year, but still a third short of pre-pandemic levels, according to JTB Corp, Japan's biggest travel agency. The yen's fall to two-decade lows would normally be a boon for in-bound travellers, but Japan, fearing COVID, has kept its borders closed to tourists. In 2019, almost 32 million foreign tourists contributed to the economy. Meanwhile, the weak yen has caused pain for many companies by increasing input costs, making them just as cautious as consumers - and reluctant to raise wages. ""Prices keep rising and rising for items we can't live without, while salaries are flat,"" Takahashi said. ""I'm constantly racking my brains over what I can skimp on next.""

5/3/2022,"The man suspected of kidnapping Madeleine McCann has claimed he had sex with a woman in his camper van and then drove her to an airport at the time of abduction, according to reports. Christian Brueckner, 43, was named an official suspect in Madeleine’s disappearance last month. It emerged he had given details of his alibi to a television documentary, Madeleine McCann: The Case Against Christian B, produced by US network AMC Crime, which will air on Channel 5 on May 11. Madeleine disappeared between 9pm and 10pm on May 3 2007, according to her parents. But Brueckner has claimed he was miles from the scene having sex in his camper van with a woman who will be his alibi, according to Sky News. By 10pm, he had driven the woman along the coast to Faro airport, Portugal, he claimed. Police previously said the suspect's phone was located near the scene on the night the three-year-old vanished. Phone mast data suggests he received a call in the village from 7.32pm to 8.02pm, police said. It is alleged he could not remember the woman’s full name when he first claimed he had an alibi, but has now been able to identify her. But prosecutors have said the 43-year-old gave no official alibi to authorities. Hans Christian Wolters, German prosecutor, told Sky News: ""I assume if he has anything that exonerates him that sooner or later he will share it with us and we would then check it out. What happens then, let's see. ""So far he has told us nothing, he's given us no alibi. So, we can only work on the evidence we have found so far in our investigation. And there was nothing to exonerate him."" Brueckner is currently serving a seven-year jail sentence in Germany for rape. A source close to the case in Germany told The Sun last month it was “baffling” that he would maintain his silence and then “finally come up with an explanation now”. Madeleine disappeared from the family’s apartment in Praia da Luz while on holiday 15 years ago. Mr Wolters told Sky News that prosecutors “haven’t found a single piece of the puzzle … that would have somehow helped to exonerate Christian B”. After Brueckner was made a formal suspect, it potentially paved the way for him to be flown from Germany to the Algarve for formal questioning. He has repeatedly denied any involvement in Madeleine’s disappearance. A written statement issued by the Portimao section of the Faro Department of Criminal Investigation and Prosecution (DIAP), issued last month after he was made a formal suspect, said: ""As part of the investigation into the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of Madeleine McCann in 2007, a person was made an arguido on Wednesday. ""The person was made an arguido by the German authorities in execution of a request for international judicial cooperation issued by the Public Ministry of Portugal. ""The investigation is led by the Portimao section of the DIAP in Faro with the assistance of the Policia Judiciaria police. ""The investigation has been carried out with the cooperation of the English and German authorities.""",World/The Telegraph,Madeleine McCann suspect Christian Brueckner: I was having sex in a camper van miles away at time of disappearance,https://news.yahoo.com/madeleine-mccann-suspect-christian-brueckner-163540815.html

5/3/2022,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — A man told police he killed American mathematician Scott Johnson in 1988 by pushing the 27-year-old off a Sydney cliff in what prosecutors describe as a gay hate crime, a court heard on Monday. Scott White, 51, appeared in the New South Wales state Supreme Court for a sentencing hearing after he pleaded guilty in January to the murder of the Los Angeles-born Canberra resident, whose death at the base of a North Head cliff was initially dismissed by police as suicide. White will be sentenced by Justice Helen Wilson on Tuesday. He faces a potential sentence of life in prison. “I pushed a bloke. He went over the edge,” White said in recorded police interview in 2020 that was played in court. White said in the interview he lied when he had earlier told police that he had tried to grab Johnson and prevent his fatal fall. A coroner ruled in 2017 that Johnson “fell from the clifftop as a result of actual or threatened violence by unidentified persons who attacked him because they perceived him to be homosexual.” Video: 'Say Gay' rally held in Melbourne There was a Brevard Say Gay Rally at Front Street Park Sunday afternoon to support solidarity with LGBQT students and families. The coroner also found that gangs of men roamed various Sydney locations in search of gay men to assault, resulting in the deaths of some victims. Some people were also robbed. A coroner had ruled in 1989 that the openly gay man had taken his own life, while a second coroner in 2012 could not explain how he died. His Boston-based brother Steve Johnson maintained pressure for further investigation and offered his own reward of 1 million Australian dollars ($704,000) for information. White was charged in 2020 and police say the reward will likely be collected. White’s former wife Helen White told the court that her then-husband “bragged” to their children of beating gay men at the clifftop well-known for gay meetups. Helen White said she read a newspaper report in 2008 about Johnson’s death and asked her husband if he was responsible. “It’s not my fault,” Scott White allegedly replied. “The dumb (expletive) ran off the cliff.” “I said, ‘It is if you chased him,’” Helen White told the court. She said her husband did not reply. Under cross-examination, Helen White denied she had been aware of a AU$1 million reward for information on Johnson’s murder when she reported her former husband to police in 2019. She said she only became aware of a reward when the victim’s brother, Steve Johnson, doubled the sum in 2020. Steve Johnson said in his victim impact statement that, “With a vicious push, Mr. White took Scott and he vanished.” “This man (Scott Johnson) who once told me he could never hurt someone even in self-defense died in terror,” the brother added. Steve Johnson said he appreciated White’s guilty plea. “If he had turned himself in after his violent action, I would have had a little more sympathy. If he had grasped Scott’s hand and pulled him to safety, I would owe him everlasting gratitude,” the brother said, his voice choked with emotion. Scott Johnson’s sisters Terry and Rebecca Johnson, his partner Michael Noone and Steve Johnson’s wife Rosemarie Johnson also gave victim impact statements. Rosemarie Johnson described the initial police failure to investigate Scott Johnson’s death as “indefensible and inhumane.” Rebecca Johnson, a younger sister, said the police report of suicide “made no sense.” “How could a community fail so spectacularly that they created boys capable of such horror?” she asked, referring to media reports of gay beatings in Sydney being described as a sport. Prosecutor Brett Hatfield said the precise details of the murder were not known and that White’s accounts had varied. White had met Johnson in a nearby bar in suburban Manly and Johnson had stripped naked at the clifftop before he died, Hatfield said. He said the gravity of the murder was significantly elevated because it was motivated by the victim’s sexuality. White’s lawyer Belinda Rigg said her client was gay and had been concerned that his homophobic brother would find out. In January, White yelled repeatedly in court during a pre-trial hearing that he was guilty, having previously denied the crime. His lawyers will appeal that plea in the Court of Criminal Appeals and hope he will be acquitted at trial. Scott Johnson was a doctoral student at Australian National University and lived in Canberra. He was staying at Noone’s parents’ Sydney home when he died.",U.S./Associated Press,Sydney man admits pushing gay American off a cliff in 1988,https://news.yahoo.com/sydney-man-admits-pushing-gay-082621284.html

Eugene De Leon Sr. was bitten on the shoulder during the Rattlesnake Roundup event in Freer, police told KII-TV. He was flown to a Corpus Christi hospital, where he died, police told the station. Organizers of the Kendall County Fair Association say De Leon died “doing what he loved, being with the rattlesnakes.” Rattlesnake Roundup is put on by the Freer Chamber of Commerce, which mourned De Leon’s death in a post on Facebook. “The love and dedication he displayed for his community was witnessed everyday from being a member of the Freer Vol. Fire Department to being a call away for local residents to assist with removing snakes from their property,” the chamber of commerce said. “He was always ready to help. We will never forget his excitement during Roundup time, from doing interviews with television stations to appearing on televised wildlife shows, he did it all.” His sister said De Leon “had a passion for snake handling” and handled rattlers for “many years.” “He was well loved by those who knew him,” added U.S. Congress candidate Sandra Whitten. “My family and I enjoy watching him handle these deadly snakes with ease, almost like he was simply dancing with them.

5/3/2022,"A business owner is going viral after breaking down the “universal” salary she pays her employees. In early April, Madeline Pendleton (@madeline_pendleton) posted a TikTok that got plenty of viewers talking. In it, she broke down how — and why — she pays every one of her employees the same salary, including herself. Gas prices are likely to continue climbing through 2022: Here's how to save at the pump Pendleton is a 35-year-old influencer, podcaster and owner of Tunnel Vision, an L.A.-based clothing store. The shop, as her clip explains, has 10 full-time employees who all make $73,000 per year. Pendleton begins her clip by emphasizing that “any” company could follow her model “without having to spend more money.” “It’s just income redistribution,” she says. She goes on to show that in 2020, the average CEO at a top-350 U.S. firm made $24.2 million, which is over 351 times more than the average American worker. Pendleton’s suggestion is to eliminate that disparity completely by paying a “universal wage.” “You just take everybody’s salary in the whole place, and then you average them out among the number of workers you have,” she says. Pendleton’s business has $730,000 in total payroll costs per year, which she breaks down evenly between herself and her nine other full-time staff members. However, as she shows, she could be making over six times that much. As an experiment, Pendleton demonstrates what would happen if she paid her nine employees $16 per hour, which will soon be the minimum wage in Los Angeles. Those employees would make slightly over $33,000 a year, while she made over $430,000. This disparity, she points out, only gets wider at bigger companies. “It’s ridiculous,” she says. “This is what those CEOs are doing, so they can make that $24 million a year while you guys make like $30K or whatever.” The point goes beyond massive companies. As of 2022, the median salary of a CEO at any U.S. company was $790,418. That includes huge firms and small businesses like Pendleton’s. YouTube star Manny MUA shares his 7-step skincare routine: Many commenters praised Pendleton’s policy. “This is EXACTLY how you do it!” one user wrote. “As a manager, I’m for it. Guarantee you my CEO’s not though,” another added. “So much love for you!” another wrote. Others questioned the policy’s limitations. Some wondered how an evenly split income could work in other fields, where experience or education differs more vastly. “So at the hospital, the doctors should make the same as the janitor?” one user asked. “Not everybody deserves the same pay. You get paid what you bring to the table,” another agreed. Still, some were just glad to see a business owner being transparent about her finances. In that sense, Pendleton’s video follows a larger trend on TikTok, where users have been sharing their salaries and earnings across many fields. TikTokers have recently revealed how much they make working at Hooters, at Waffle House and even as NFL water boys.

5/3/2022,"Another Russian general has been killed in Ukraine, authorities claim. Maj. Gen. Andrei Simonov was reportedly killed in an attack on a Russian command post near the city of Izyum. The general, who commanded electric warfare units, was among 100 Russian servicemen killed. Russia has lost another general in Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, according to top Ukrainian officials, The Kyiv Post has reported Maj. Gen. Andrei Simonov was killed near the city of Izyum in the Kharkiv region, which is currently occupied by Russian forces, Ukrainian authorities said. The Ukrainian military attacked a field command post of the Russian 2nd Army on Saturday, striking more than 30 Russian armored vehicles, including tanks, according to the paper. Footage posted on social media appears to show the command post being bombarded by rockets, said the Kyiv Post. The general was among 100 Russian soldiers killed in the attack, President Zellenskyy's military adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said, according to The Kyiv Post. Arestovych said well-placed army sources had confirmed the death of Maj. Gen. Simonov in a YouTube interview, per the Mail Online. The claims by the Ukrainian authorities have not been independently verified. Russia has not as of yet confirmed the death of Maj. Gen. Simonov. Simonov was a senior commander of electronic warfare, Ukrainian government advisor Anton Gerashchenko said on his Telegram account. His death would make him the tenth Russian general to die in Ukraine, according to a count by The Kyiv Post. Russia has suffered heavy losses since it began its invasion of Ukraine on February 24, losing many of its top generals and commanders. NATO estimates that Russia has lost up to 15,000 troops during the war, while Ukraine claims to have killed nearly 20,000. Russia has put its official death toll in Ukraine at 1,351, which was last updated on March 25.

5/3/2022,"Two years into the pandemic, people continue to hunt for greener pastures in more affordable towns better suited to a pandemic-era lifestyle than big coastal cities. The pandemic scrambled the calculus for most home hunters as to what they should prioritize when buying or renting a home. The pervasiveness of working from home made living in a cramped one-bedroom apartment untenable for many big city-dwellers, especially families. The opportunity to work from anywhere led many to reevaluate what they wanted from a home. Larger homes, gardens, and a more affordable cost of living suddenly became much more important, and data reflecting last year’s moving patterns is beginning to reflect these new considerations. Cities in Sun Belt states have become the new hotspot for Americans looking to move, according to a new survey by moving truck rental company Penske, which crunched the numbers on which direction one-way truck rentals have been headed over the past year. The top 10 cities Americans are choosing to relocate to are: Houston Las Vegas Phoenix Charlotte Denver San Antonio Dallas Orlando Austin Chicago Most of the top cities where movers want to relocate enjoy pleasant temperatures and allow residents easy access to outdoor recreational opportunities. The more popular states, Texas and Florida, also happen to have no income tax, an appealing incentive to move for people living in states with high tax brackets like New York or California. ""The most popular cities are in the Sun Belt, and are places with lower costs and warmer climates,"" Randy Ryerson, vice president of marketing and communications for Penske, told Fortune. Texas cities dominated the list, after a year of record population and job growth in the state. Houston was one of America’s fastest growing cities in 2021, while Austin is emerging as one of the country’s premier tech hubs amidst a historic job boom. In 2021, relocations in the U.S. ticked up considerably as millions of Americans sought out new places to live. The number of Americans who moved last year jumped 20% above 2020 levels, according to a February survey by relocating company North American Van Lines, as up to 23 million people in the country chose to relocate to places that accommodated new pandemic-era lifestyles. The surge in movers has primarily been motivated work-from-home options, which have opened up many new opportunities for people considering a move. “As remote work became the new normal for companies over the past year, it opened the door formore people to move farther away from the workplace and explore living in a new area. Our data hasshown that for some, spending more time at home during the pandemic inspired the want for a changeof scenery,"" Ryerson said. But the influx of new residents in this city has had its consequences. With wealthier homebuyers and renters flooding smaller towns with New York and California salaries, housing prices in these cities have been growing at some of the fastest rates in the country. Home prices across the country have been soaring during the pandemic, rising by a national average of 19.8% over the past year. But some of the cities on this list have seen prices go way higher. Homes in Houston, San Antonio, Charlotte, and Las Vegas have all seen prices surge above 20% this year. Prices in Phoenix are up more than 30%, and nearly 40% higher in Austin. In many of these cities, a big reason behind the home price surge has been the influx of new residents with deeper pockets who can outbid locals. In Austin, a survey of moving data found that most of the people moving to the city in 2021 came from one of Los Angeles, San Francisco, or San Jose, newcomers who have already begun outpricing locals in the housing market.

5/3/2022,"KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine has formally closed its four Black and Azov sea ports, which Russian forces have captured, the Ukrainian agriculture ministry said on Monday. The Azov Sea ports of Mariupol, Berdiansk and Skadovsk and the Black Sea port of Kherson were closed ""until the restoration of control"", the ministry said in a statement. ""The adoption of this measure is caused by the impossibility of servicing ships and passengers, carrying out cargo, transport and other related economic activities, ensuring the appropriate level of safety of navigation,"" it said. All Ukrainian seaports have suspended their activity as a result of the Russian invasion in late February. Russian forces captured some ports and blockaded others. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday Ukraine could lose tens of millions of tonnes of grain due to Russia's control of Black Sea shipping, triggering a food crisis that will affect Europe, Asia and Africa. ""Russia does not let ships come in or go out, it is controlling the Black Sea,"" Zelenskiy told the Australian news programme 60 Minutes. ""Russia wants to completely block our country's economy.""

While he said he is not considering canceling $50,000 in student debt for every federal borrower — an amount many progressives have been pushing for — a number of reports have suggested the president is considering at least $10,000 in relief that will likely be tied to income limits, and it will be implemented before the pause on payments expires after August 31.

Susan Collins previously told Insider student-loan forgiveness is ""not fair"" to those who have already repaid their debt and argued people with higher incomes shouldn't qualify for the broad relief Biden is considering.

5/3/2022,"On Last Week Tonight With John Oliver Sunday, Oliver took aim at Florida Governor Ron DeSantis over recent legislation against Disney. In response to Disney coming out against Florida’s so-called “Don’t Say Gay” bill, the Republican-led Florida legislature passed a bill revoking Disney’s special tax status, which DeSantis signed into law. Despite DeSantis saying otherwise, experts say the move will substantially increase taxes on Floridians. “There are plenty of signs that DeSantis didn’t really think this through, with experts pointing out that the law might actually violate the contract clause of the Florida constitution,” Oliver said. “And also, the Florida state law requires the county assumes the district’s debt when it’s dissolved, which could mean that Orange and Osceola counties, where the district is, inherit upward of a billion dollars in bond debt.” Oliver made clear that he doesn’t have a problem with Disney paying higher taxes, but more so why they’ll be paying higher taxes if the law goes into effect next year as planned. “Do I think it’s bad if Disney pays more taxes? No, I don’t. That would be a good thing,” Oliver said. “I don’t love that it might happen, not through meaningful tax reform, but on the whim of one right wing dipsh*t who’s scared of gay people and doesn’t understand the first amendment. But hey, ends, means, what are you gonna do?” JOHN OLIVER: A lot of governors and local officials are on the ballot this year, and some have been trying to make a splash with big stunts like Ron DeSantis, governor of Florida, and a man who has what I can only describe as ""Green Book"" vibes. KYLIE MAR: On ""Last Week Tonight with John Oliver"" Sunday, Oliver slammed Florida governor Ron DeSantis over the state's new law stripping Disney of its special tax status in the state. The bill was passed in retaliation for Disney coming out against Florida's so-called ""Don't Say Gay"" bill. DeSantis has said Disney will end up paying more in taxes, which Oliver doesn't have a problem with, but he does have a problem with why. JOHN OLIVER: Do I think it's bad if Disney pays more taxes? No, I don't. That would be a good thing. I don't love that it might happen not through meaningful tax reform but on the whim of one right wing dipshit who's scared of gay people and doesn't understand the First Amendment.

5/3/2022,"Russian troops stole nearly $5 million worth of farm equipment from a John Deere dealership in Melitopol. The stolen equipment was located by remote GPS and locked, preventing it from being used. ""When the invaders drove the stolen harvesters to Chechnya, they realized that they could not even turn them on,"" a source told CNN. Russian troops occupying the Ukrainian city of Melitopol stole nearly $5 million of farm vehicles from a John Deere dealership and shipped some of them more than 700 miles to Chechnya, CNN reported, only to find they had been rendered useless by a remote-locking system that prevented the thieves from turning the equipment on. Two compound harvesters, valued at $300,000 each, as well as 27 other tractors, seeders, and additional pieces of equipment were stolen from the dealership. But the remote access technology of the equipment, which allows for GPS tracking and some of the vehicles to be remotely operated, prevented them from being used. ""When the invaders drove the stolen harvesters to Chechnya, they realized that they could not even turn them on, because the harvesters were locked remotely,"" a source familiar with the incident told CNN. While the equipment could still be scrapped and sold for parts by Russian troops, the source said it is currently lying idle on a farm near Grozny. Melitopol – a city in the country's southeast – has been under Russian occupation since early March. Other recent reports from the area have said invading troops looted a museum of gold artifacts and stole hundreds of thousands of tons of grain from the region.

5/3/2022,"Harrison Jozefowicz quit his job as a Chicago police officer and headed overseas soon after Russia invaded Ukraine. An Army veteran, he said he couldn't help but join American volunteers seeking to help Ukrainians in their fight. Jozefowicz now heads a group called Task Force Yankee, which he said has placed more than 190 volunteers in combat slots and other roles while delivering nearly 15,000 first aid kits, helping relocate more than 80 families and helping deliver dozens of pallets of food and medical supplies to the southern and eastern fronts of the war. It's difficult, dangerous work. But Jozefowicz said he felt helpless watching from the United States last year during the U.S. pullout from Afghanistan, particularly after a close friend, Staff Sgt. Ryan Knauss, died in a suicide bombing at Kabul. ""So, I’m just trying to do everything I can to make sure I can help others not go through what I went through,” he said Saturday during an interview conducted through a messaging platform. A former U.S. Marine who died last week was believed to be the first American citizen killed while fighting in Ukraine. Willy Joseph Cancel, 22, died Monday while working for a military contracting company that sent him to Ukraine, his mother, Rebecca Cabrera, told CNN. An undetermined number of other Americans — many with military backgrounds — are thought to be in the country battling Russian forces beside both Ukrainians and volunteers from other countries even though U.S. forces aren't directly involved in fighting aside from sending military materiel, humanitarian aid and money. The U.S. government discourages Americans from fighting in Ukraine, which raises legal and national security issues. Russia’s invasion has given Ukraine's embassy in Washington the task of fielding inquiries from thousands of Americans who want to help in the fight, and Ukraine is using the internet to recruit volunteers for a foreign force, the International Legion of Defense of Ukraine. “Anyone who wants to join the defense of security in Europe and the world can come and stand side by side with the Ukrainians against the invaders of the 21st century,” President President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a recruitment pitch. Texan Anja Osmon, who did tours in Iraq and Afghanistan while serving in the U.S. Army from 2009 through 2015, said she went to Ukraine on her own. A medic, she said she arrived in Ukraine on March 20 and lived in the woods with other members of the International Legion before a new commander sent her away because he didn’t want female fighters. Osmon, 30, said her mother wants her home before September. But for now she’s anxious to get out of the hotel where she is staying in Lviv and catch on with another fighting force nearer the action. “I can’t turn away from injustice,” she said. “No one should be scared.” U.S. Marine veteran Eddy Etue said he quit his job in the gig economy, found a friend in Colorado to watch his cat and gave up his home four blocks from the beach in San Diego, California, to help out in Ukraine, where he's been about two weeks. He first worked with an aid organization but now is training with the International Legion. Etue, 36, said he simply couldn't stay home. “It's just the right thing to do,” said Etue, who financed the journey through an online fundraising campaign. Etue's family history pulled him toward Ukraine. He said his grandparents left Hungary with nothing but their four children and clothes after the 1956 revolution, which was put down by Soviet forces that killed or wounded thousands. “What’s happening here will affect not only the people who are experiencing it but their children and grandchildren as well,"" he said. ""I know that from personal experience.” Jozefowicz, the former Chicago cop, says there are thousands of American and other volunteers in Ukraine. Multiple organizations are operating in the country, and Jozefowicz said his group alone has placed scores of volunteers in positions all over the country, with about 40 of those being combat jobs. “We do not facilitate a civilian going into any direct-action role. We only guide and connect prior military volunteers,” he said. But there's plenty of other work to do. Groups of volunteers are getting medical and food supplies to people in the nation of 44 million people, he said, and others are working with refugees and others who've had to flee their homes. “The closer I got into Ukraine and the more time I spent in Ukraine, the more voids I found that needed to be filled to maximize my groups volunteer efforts,” he said. Osmon, who said she's been in contact with Jozefowicz's group, said she supplied troops with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medications after days in the woods. “Most everyone had air raid fever from hiding in the trenches in the snow and cold air,” she said. “Bronchitis was ravaging us.” Etue said he got a feel for the country after making a 24-hour round trip with another volunteer to pick up a vehicle in Odessa. He said he's been impressed with the quality of people serving in the International Legion since Ukrainians have done a good job of weeding out the inexperienced and “war tourists” who don't have much to offer a military unit. “I think they’re doing amazingly well given that they’re at war with one of the largest standing armies in the world,” he said.",World/Associated Press,Combat death puts spotlight on Americans fighting in Ukraine,https://news.yahoo.com/combat-death-puts-spotlight-americans-151431291.html
5/3/2022,"Two new strains of COVID that appear to be more transmissible than even “stealth Omicron,” and that have the ability to evade antibodies from vaccination and prior infection, have arrived in the U.S.—and they could mean a new wave is coming. BA.4 and BA.5—like the original Omicron, BA.1—originated in South Africa. Cases are surging there despite the fact that almost all South Africans have been vaccinated or had COVID, Bloomberg reported last week. The country's National Institute for Communicable Diseases reported nearly 4,000 new infections on Sunday alone. Of those who were tested for COVID, 22% received positive results. The World Health Organization initially recommended levels of below 5% for communities wishing to reopen after COVID's first wave. People who have been both vaccinated against COVID and infected with Omicron may very well get sick if they contract the subvariants. But they probably won’t require hospitalization or die, a top COVID researcher from South Africa told Fortune. “If you were vaccinated and had Omicron, your protection is decent, at least against severe disease,” said Alex Sigal, a professor at the Africa Health Research Institute in South Africa. He’s one of the authors on a new study that found BA.4 and BA.5 could result in a new wave of infection due to their ability to evade antibodies, both from vaccination and earlier infection. “If anybody is protected, it should be these people,” he added. That’s good news for many, but America’s vaccination rates are not where they could be. Around 66.2% of the total population is fully vaccinated, and only 45.8% have received a booster, according to the CDC. Children under 5 are still not eligible for the vaccine. Others won’t be so fortunate. Sigal says those who have been infected with COVID prior to Omicron likely don’t have much immunity to BA.4 and BA.5. Those who were infected with Omicron but not vaccinated won’t have much immunity either. “It could go either way” for them, he said. BA.4 and BA.5 appear to be more infectious than BA.2, also known as “stealth Omicron,” which was more infectious than the original Omicron, Bloomberg reported Thursday, citing South African COVID expert Tulio de Oliveira, the head of the institutes at the universities of KwaZulu-Natal and Stellenbosch. On Friday, Fortune was the first to report that both variants had arrived in the U.S., citing multiple COVID-19 researchers with access to Gisaid, an international research database that tracks changes in COVID and the flu virus. The earliest sample of BA.4 in the U.S. was collected on March 30. The earliest sample of BA.5 in the U.S. was collected March 29. A new BA.4/BA.5 wave is “a strong possibility,” given the subvariants’ increased transmissibility and their ability to evade immunity, Sigal and his team wrote in their new study. But Sigal doesn’t expect a huge wave, given that Omicron infected so many worldwide. He also doesn’t expect “a very severe wave in terms of disease severity,” he said, given the measure of protection—albeit reduced—that vaccination and/or prior Omicron infection will offer. “Infections? Yes,” he said. “Disease severity? Not so much.” Sigal and his team tested the new subvariants against blood samples from individuals who had been vaccinated with shots from Pfizer or Johnson & Johnson, and who had experienced a breakthrough BA.1 infection, as well as those who had been previously infected with BA.1 but had not been vaccinated. They found that those who had been previously infected but not vaccinated experienced a nearly eightfold drop in neutralizing antibodies when exposed to the new subvariants. Those who had been vaccinated and previously infected saw a more mild threefold decrease, according to the study. Sigal said he was surprised by the study’s results. He didn’t expect BA.4 and BA.5 to escape immunity so well, especially considering that the variants have only two changes when compared to the original Omicron. “But apparently those are big changes,” he said. So far symptoms of the new variants seem pretty similar to the typical Omicron symptoms, which include fever, loss of smell, and malaise. “I haven’t seen early symptoms of respiratory distress, the major COVID-specific symptom that makes this disease so dangerous,” he said. “It doesn’t feel nice, but there’s less chance of dying.” There’s “good evidence” that COVID is becoming milder with time, he said, due to the fact that it’s not infecting the lower respiratory tract, where permanent damage can happen and dangerous low blood oxygen saturations can be triggered. So far, newer COVID variants reside in the upper respiratory tract, where they're unlikely to cause serious illness. Until recently, experts thought that a new, very different variant would be required to cause a wave, as was the case with Delta. But now subvariants “seem to be able to make a new wave,” Sigal said. Subvariants—including BA.4 and BA.5—worry him less than new variants. “They’re not so different from what was there before. They’re not going to do a huge amount of damage even though they might do a lot of infection,” he said. “When I see something completely different, that’s when it’s time to really get concerned.” This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Health/Fortune,Two new Omicron variants detected in the U.S. could spark another COVID wave.

5/3/2022,"Kyiv said Monday that its drones sank two Russian patrol boats near the Black Sea's Snake Island where Ukrainian soldiers rebuffed Moscow's demands to surrender at the start of its invasion. ""Two Russian Raptor boats were destroyed at dawn today near Snake Island,"" Ukraine's defense ministry said in a statement distributed on social media. The defense ministry also released grainy black-and-white aerial footage showing an explosion on a small military vessel. ""The Bayraktars are working,"" Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the commander in chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, was cited as saying in the statement, referring to Turkish-made military drones. Raptor patrol boats can carry up to three crew and 20 personnel. They are usually equipped with machine guns and used in reconnaissance or landing operations. Snake Island became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance after a radio exchange went viral in which Ukrainian soldiers rebuffed demands from crew of a Russian warship to surrender. The Russian ship involved, the Moskva, sank in the Black Sea in mid-April following what Moscow said was an explosion on board. Ukraine said it had hit the warship with missiles. The reported drone strikes come more than two weeks after the Ukrainian military said that it had badly damaged one of Russia's most essential warships with a missile strike off Ukraine's battered southern coast. Meanwhile, a long-awaited effort to evacuate people from a steel plant in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol has begun, the International Committee on the Red Cross (ICRC) and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday. The operation to bring people out of the sprawling Azovstal steel plant was being done by the ICRC with the United Nations and in coordination with Ukrainian and Russian officials, an ICRC spokesperson told CBS News. Zelenskyy tweeted that the ""1st group of about 100 people is already heading to the controlled area,"" and said Ukrainian officials are ""working on the evacuation of other civilians from the plant.""

5/3/2022,"By Crispian Balmer JERUSALEM (Reuters) -Israel lambasted Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Monday for claiming that Adolf Hitler had Jewish origins, saying it was an ""unforgivable"" falsehood that debased the horrors of the Nazi Holocaust. In a signal of sharply deteriorating relations with Moscow, the Israeli foreign ministry summoned the Russian ambassador and demanded an apology. ""Such lies are intended to accuse the Jews themselves of the most horrific crimes in history that were committed against them,"" Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said in a statement. ""The use of the Holocaust of the Jewish people for political purposes must stop immediately,"" he added. Lavrov made the assertion on Italian television on Sunday when he was asked why Russia said it needed to ""denazify"" Ukraine if the country's own president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was himself Jewish. ""When they say 'What sort of nazification is this if we are Jews', well I think that Hitler also had Jewish origins, so it means nothing,"" Lavrov told Rete 4 channel, speaking through an Italian interpreter. ""For a long time now we've been hearing the wise Jewish people say that the biggest anti-Semites are the Jews themselves,"" he added. Dani Dayan, chairman of Yad Vashem, Israel's memorial to the six million Jews killed in the Holocaust, said the Russian minister's remarks were ""an insult and a severe blow to the victims of the real Nazism"". Speaking on Kan radio, Dayan said Lavrov was spreading ""an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory with no basis in fact"". The identity of one of Hitler's grandfathers is not known but there has been some speculation, never backed up by any evidence, that he might have been a Jew. There was no immediate response for comment from the Russian embassy to Israel or from Lavrov in Moscow. STRAINED RELATIONS Kyiv condemned Lavrov's words, saying his ""heinous remarks"" were offensive to Zelenskiy, to Israel, Ukraine and Jews. ""More broadly, they demonstrate that today’s Russia is full of hatred towards other nations,"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter. Israeli Foreign Ministry Yair Lapid, whose grandfather died in the Holocaust, said that accusing Jews of being anti-Semites was ""the basest level of racism"". He also dismissed Lavrov's assertion that pro-Nazi elements held sway over the Ukrainian government and military. ""The Ukrainians aren't Nazis. Only the Nazis were Nazis and only they dealt with the systematic destruction of the Jewish people,"" Lapid told the YNet news website. A German government spokesperson said the idea Hitler had Jewish heritage was ""absurd"" propaganda. Israel has expressed repeated support for Ukraine following the Russian invasion in February. But wary of straining relations with Russia, a powerbroker in neighbouring Syria, it initially avoided direct criticism of Moscow and has not enforced formal sanctions on Russian oligarchs. However, relations have grown more strained, with Lapid last month accusing Russia of committing war crimes in Ukraine. However, the Ukrainian president has also run into flak in Israel by looking to draw analogies between the conflict in his country and World War Two. In an address to the Israeli parliament in March, Zelenskiy compared the Russian offensive in Ukraine to Nazi Germany's plan to murder all Jews within its reach during World War Two. Yad Vashem called his comments ""irresponsible,"" saying they trivialised the historical facts of the Holocaust.

5/3/2022,"Good morning. More than a quarter of the 120 battalion units Russia committed to Ukraine have now been rendered ""combat ineffective"", said the Ministry of Defence. The losses represent approximately 65 per cent of Russia's entire ground combat strength and include elite units. ""Some of Russia’s most elite units, including the VDV Airborne Forces, have suffered the highest levels of attrition. It will probably take years for Russia to reconstitute these forces."" Meanwhile, the first evacuees evacuated from the ruined Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol were due to arrive in the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia on Monday morning, said President Volodymyr Zelensky, after the UN confirmed a ""safe passage operation"" was in progress. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said hundreds of civilians remain trapped in the steelworks in a situation that has ""become a sign of a real humanitarian catastrophe"", as food, water and medicine becomes scarce. Here's what happened overnight. Nancy Pelosi visited Kyiv on Saturday as the most senior American lawmaker to travel to Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion. Accompanying her was Rep. Jason Crow, a US Army veteran and a member of the House intelligence and armed services committees, who said he was there with three things in mind: ""Weapons, weapons and weapons."" Ms Pelosi visit came just days after Russia launched rockets at the capital during a visit by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. Russian forces fired on the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol again on Sunday night, breaking a ceasefire that has allowed around 100 people to be evacuated. Speaking on local television, a Ukrainian soldier said the Russians were using “all kinds of weapons” to attack the steel plant, CNN reported. The alleged attack followed the much-anticipated rescue of civilians from the besieged steelworks, where the last pocket of resistance remains in the city. About 100 civilians were evacuated to safety on Sunday with further evacuations planned for Monday. It is unclear whether the renewed attacks will hinder these plans, said CNN. Russia's defence ministry said on Sunday it had struck at weapons supplied to Ukraine by the United States and European countries and destroyed a runway at a military airfield near the Ukrainian city of Odesa. The ministry said it used high-precision Onyx missiles to strike the airfield, after Ukraine accused Russia of knocking out a newly-constructed runway at the main airport of Odesa. Odesa regional governor Maksym Marchenko said Russia had used a Bastion missile, launched from Crimea. The reports could not be independently verified. First lady Jill Biden will visit Romania and Slovakia from May 5-9 to meet with US service members and embassy personnel, displaced Ukrainian parents and children, humanitarian aid workers, and teachers, her office said on Monday On Sunday, celebrated as Mother's Day in the United States, Biden will meet with Ukrainian mothers and children who have been forced to flee their homes because of Russia's war against Ukraine, her office said. The wife of President Joe Biden will meet with U.S. military service members at Mihail Kogalniceau Airbase in Romania on May 6, before heading to Bucharest to meet with Romanian government officials, U.S. embassy staff, humanitarian aid workers, and teachers working with displaced Ukrainian children. The trip also includes stops in the Slovakian cities of Bratislava, Kosice and Vysne Nemecke, where Biden will meet with government officials, refugees and aid workers, her office said. Russia may have averted default as it announced it had made several overdue payments in dollars on its overseas bonds, shifting the market's focus to upcoming payments and whether it would stave off a historic default. Russia's $40 billion in international bonds and the chance of a default have become the focus of global financial markets since it was hit with sanctions from the United States and its allies after its invasion of Ukraine in late February. Dubbed a ""special military operation"" by Russia, the invasion has turned Russia into a pariah, including in financial markets, and has entangled its ability to pay its debts. The chance of default dramatically increased in early April when the United States stopped the Russian government from using frozen reserves to pay some $650 million to its bondholders.

5/3/2022,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity grew at its slowest pace in more than 1-1/2 years in April amid a rise in workers quitting their jobs, and manufacturers are becoming more anxious about supply over the summer because of China's zero tolerance COVID-19 policy. The Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) Manufacturing Business Survey Committee Chair Timothy Fiore said on Monday that coronavirus outbreaks overseas were ""creating a near-term headwind for the U.S. manufacturing community,"" noting that some manufacturers worried ""about their Asian partners' ability to deliver reliably in the summer months."" The ISM's index of national factory activity fell to a reading of 55.4 last month, the lowest since a matching reading in September 2020, from 57.1 in March. The last time the index was lower was in July 2020. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 12% of the U.S. economy. Fiore described manufacturing as remaining ""in a demand-driven, supply chain-constrained environment."" Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 57.6. The second straight monthly decline in the index also reflects spending rotating back to services like travel, dining out and recreation. Government data on Friday showed consumer spending on services increasing by the most in eight months in March, while outlays on long-lasting manufactured goods dropped for a second consecutive month. Five of the six biggest manufacturing industries - machinery, computer and electronic products, food, transportation equipment and chemical products - registered moderate-to-strong growth. Manufacturers offered a mixed assessment of supply chains. Makers of chemical products reported that supplier shutdowns in Shanghai and long delays at ports, including in the United States ""are still providing supply challenges."" In the food industry, supply chains were described as ""still constrained."" The tough lockdowns in Shanghai have left at least 25 million people stuck indoors for more than a month, some sealed inside fenced-off residential compounds. Miscellaneous goods manufacturers said they had ""extended lead times to customers and are ordering product from China to cover demand through the fourth quarter and early first-quarter 2023."" But transportation equipment manufacturers noted ""improvements in the supply chain."" Manufacturers of nonmetallic mineral products said ""improvements in supply chain are occurring on larger scale items."" ""Manufacturing should continue to add to GDP growth but the breadth of growth has narrowed,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Risks to the near-term outlook remain weighted to the downside because of the Fed's aggressive tightening cycle, financial market conditions and geopolitical conflict."" A separate report from the Commerce Department on Monday showed construction spending barely rose in March, prompting economists to expect that first-quarter gross domestic product would be revised lower to show the economy contracting at a 1.5% annualized rate instead of the 1.4% pace reported last week, when the government publishes it second GDP estimate later this month. The Federal Reserve is expected to hike interest rates by half-a-percentage point on Wednesday. The U.S. central bank raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points in March, and is soon likely to start trimming its asset holdings. Stocks on Wall Street were mostly lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell. INPUT PRICE GROWTH SLOWS The ISM survey's forward-looking new orders sub-index dipped to 53.5 from 53.8 in March. Goods spending surged as the COVID-19 pandemic restricted movement. With customer inventories running extremely lean for more than 60 months, manufacturing is in no danger of stalling. Though order backlogs dropped for a second straight month, they remained at high levels, with computer and electronic products, machinery and transportation equipment manufacturers reporting a rise in unfinished work. The survey's measure of supplier deliveries rose to 67.2 from 65.4 in March. A reading above 50% indicates slower deliveries to factories. Tight supply chains have been exacerbated by Russia's war against Ukraine, which has boosted prices of oil and other commodities. The Russia-Ukraine war is also restraining export growth. But there was some encouraging news on inflation, with 4.4% of manufacturers in the survey reporting lower prices in April. A measure of prices paid by manufacturers dropped to a reading of 84.6 from 87.1 in March. That supports views that overall inflation has either peaked or is close to doing so. There were fewer workers on factory floors last month. The survey's measure of factory employment fell to a reading of 50.9 from 56.3 in March. Manufacturers generally reported higher rates of quits compared to the previous months, with fewer saying there had been an improvement in meeting head-count targets. Just over a third expressed difficulty in filling positions, up from 28% in March. There were a near record 11.3 million job openings at the end of February. The decline in the manufacturing employment index suggests factory payrolls moderated in April. According to a Reuters survey of economists, manufacturing employment likely increased by 35,000 jobs last month after rising by 38,000 in March. Overall, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 400,000 jobs after advancing by 431,000 in March. ""We expect a somewhat slower pace of monthly employment growth in upcoming months as lack of available labor constrains hiring,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at Citigroup in New York. ""Indications of weaker employment would not necessarily be a signal of a more dovish Fed, as tighter monetary policy intentionally acts to weigh on demand for labor in order to bring demand more in line with supply.""

5/3/2022,"Lindell was banned from Twitter in 2021 over election misinformation but rejoined the platform Sunday. The account was quickly banned for violating Twitter's ban evasion policy. ""Jack Dorsey should be first in line for prison!"" Lindell told Insider via text. MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell was banned from Twitter on Sunday hours after making a return to the platform. Lindell, a supporter of former President Donald Trump, was banned from Twitter in January 2021 for spreading misinformation about the 2020 election. On Sunday afternoon, he posted to a new account announcing his return. ""Hello everybody, I'M BACK ON TWITTER. My only account is @MikeJLindell! Please RT and FOLLOW to SPREAD THE WORD,"" Lindell said in a tweet, Insider's Bethany Biron reported. The tweet also featured a video of Lindell confirming the account was in fact his. ""All those other ones are fake accounts and they've been using my name out there, so we started this account,"" he said. ""Please share with everybody you know, let everybody you know, so we can get the word out at Twitter in case they do take it down. Thanks a lot for helping out."" About three and a half hours later, the account was suspended. A Twitter spokesperson told Insider the account was permanently suspended for violating the platform's rules on ban evasion. Twitter's ban evasion policy prohibits anyone from trying to evade a previous ban, including by creating a new account. Lindell was initially banned from Twitter for violating the platform's rules on misinformation and its civic-integrity policy, which prohibits sharing false or misleading information about how to vote or election outcomes. Lindell told Insider Twitter did not give him a reason for the latest ban but called it a ""shame."" ""We need to melt down the voting machines and turn them into prison bars,"" Lindell said, referencing his own efforts to have voting machines blocked from use in US elections. ""Jack Dorsey should be first in line for prison!"" Twitter cofounder Jack Dorsey stepped down as CEO in November. Dorsey is still on Twitter's board but has said he plans to leave when his term expires in late May. Lindell also said he decided to rejoin Twitter because others were creating fake accounts pretending to be him. ""I put up the Twitter account today to let the public know that none of the fake Mike Lindell accounts on Twitter are mine,"" Lindell said, adding that he is still on his own social-media platform, Frank Social. His attempt to rejoin the platform came after Twitter announced on Monday that Elon Musk was buying the platform in a $44 billion deal. The Tesla and SpaceX billionaire has said he is interested in promoting ""free speech"" on the platform, prompting speculation about potential changes to Twitter's content-moderation policies and previous bans. Sources recently told The Wall Street Journal that Musk is dismayed that Trump is still banned from Twitter, but the former president previously said he does not plan to return to the platform even if Musk takes over.

5/3/2022,"Callan Frazier was fishing at Lake Sam Rayburn in eastern Texas when he caught a longnose gar. “Whoa, what a gar,” Texas Parks and Wildlife said when sharing photos of the big fish on April 25. It was about 58 inches long, rivaling the “official state record longnose gar” caught by Amanda Martin in June 2021, according to Texas Parks and Wildlife. Her gar, caught in Brazos River, measured in at 30.3 pounds and 58 inches long. Callan, 16, and his dad don’t know how much his “rare” catch weighed, as they didn’t have time to get official measurements after spending 10 minutes reeling it in, according to MySanAntonio.com. “Gars are kind of hard to hold because from the gills up it’s just solid teeth,” father Bryan Frazier told the news site. “So we went ahead and put it back in the water. We know it was a trophy class but, at that moment, it was good to let it go and watch it swim away.” Longnose gars can be found in most Texas rivers, according to the state parks department. The fish species can also be found throughout the eastern U.S. Lake Sam Rayburn, also called Sam Rayburn Reservoir, is about 140 miles northeast of Houston.

5/3/2022,"HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida discussed the war in Ukraine with Vietnamese leaders on Sunday and said they agreed on the respect for international law and rejection of the use of force. Japan has condemned Russia's invasion and joined Western nations in imposing sanctions against Moscow. Vietnam, like most other Southeast Asian nations, has avoided directly criticizing Russia and has called for restraint, the respect of the U.N. charter and dialogue to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict. Vietnam abstained from a vote at the U.N. General Assembly in March that deplored Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Vietnam is one of Moscow's historic allies and Vietnam's military has been equipped mostly with Russian weapons. It has also strong ties with Ukraine, where about 10,000 Vietnamese live, work and study. In recent years, Vietnam has forged closer ties with the United States in opposing China's vast territorial claims in the South China Sea. “We cannot accept the actions to change status quo by force in any region of the world,” Kishida said after talks with his Vietnamese counterpart, Pham Minh Chinh. Kishida also criticized China's actions in the South China Sea, where Beijing has constructed artificial islands and turned them into military outposts to reinforce its territorial claims that have been rejected by its smaller neighbors.",World/Associated Press,"Japanese, Vietnamese leaders reject use of force in Ukraine",https://news.yahoo.com/japanese-vietnamese-leaders-reject-force-094746935.html
