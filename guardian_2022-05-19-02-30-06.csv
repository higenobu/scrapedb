5/19/2022,"Rishi Sunak has vowed to cut taxes for business in his autumn budget, as the Treasury continues to weigh up interventions to tackle the cost of living. With MPs from across the Tory party urging him to take emergency action to help struggling families after inflation hit a 40-year high of 9%, Sunak will tell business leaders at the CBI dinner, “never, ever doubt we are on your side.” During the speech on Wednesday night, he will call for more investment in innovation to grow the economy – and say the government will cut taxes to enable business to do so. “We need you to invest more, train more and innovate more,” the chancellor will say. “In the autumn budget we will cut your taxes to encourage you to do all those things. That is the path to higher productivity, higher living standards and a more prosperous and secure future.” The CBI has been calling for more generous allowances, to allow companies to write off more of the cost of investment against their tax bill. Sunak introduced a “super deduction” to incentivise investment, but that is due to end in April next year, just as the corporation tax rate is due to increase, from 19% to 23%. The chancellor is expected to say that the government will act to tackle inflation as well as supporting people into better paid jobs, setting out a three-point plan on the cost of living, boosting growth and investment. Boris Johnson came under pressure from Labour leader Keir Starmer at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday about the government’s failure to do more to help hard-pressed consumers. Urging the prime minister to impose a windfall tax on energy companies, Starmer said, “He just doesn’t get it, does he? He doesn’t actually understand what working families are going through in this country, struggling about how they are going to pay their bills. Starmer went on: “He’s on the side of excess profits for oil and gas companies. We’re on the side of working people. And there you have it.” Johnson and Sunak have held a series of meetings aimed at thrashing out a package of measures to ease the cost of living crisis. Options under consideration include a 1p income tax cut from the autumn or a potential VAT cut, but new measures to help with the cost-of-living could come sooner, including an increase in the warm homes discount for the poorest families. The scheme operates via energy companies, and saw bills cut by £140 last winter. The treasury could broaden the number of households covered, and boost its value, perhaps by up to £500, as energy bills surge again in October. In his speech, Sunak will stress that the government cannot wholly offset the sharp increase in prices, which has been driven by household fuel bills, but also the rising cost of goods including food. “I cannot pretend this will be easy. As I told the House of Commons yesterday: there is no measure any government could take, no law we could pass, that can make these global forces disappear overnight. The next few months will be tough,” he will say. He is expected to stress measures the government has already taken, including the fuel duty cut, council tax discounts and the change to the universal credit taper rate as well as the national minimum wage increase. “As the situation evolves our response will evolve. I have always been clear, we stand ready to do more,” he will say. The Treasury said the comments would flesh out pledges in Sunak’s Mais lecture, where he said the priority for tax cuts would be on business investment. He said the overall tax treatment of capital investment was much less generous than the OECD average. “It is unclear that cutting the headline corporation tax rate did lead to a step change in business investment; we need our future tax policy to be targeted and strategic,” he said at the lecture. “So as I develop a business tax strategy for the years ahead, it seems likely to me that a priority will be to cut taxes on business investment.” Last year the government announced its intention to increase the headline rate of corporation tax, the tax businesses pay on their profits. That is scheduled to rise to 25% for company profits over £250,000 from April 2023 – though it was announced alongside investment incentives. MPs told the Commons on Tuesday that some of their constituents were turning to shoplifting for essentials, while another warned that he had heard of cases of attempted suicide among those who could not afford to make ends meet. As MPs continued to debate the Queen’s speech on Tuesday, Conservatives from across the party called for more action on the cost of living. Bernard Jenkin, who chairs the Commons liaison committee, laid out what he said was a £13.5bn package of policies, including restoring the £20 uplift in universal credit made during the pandemic. “A summer package to rescue the most vulnerable households is needed to avoid real financial distress and personal anguish and to support economic demand of the most vulnerable households, or we are creating possibly a worse recession than is already expected,” he said.",News/Politics,Rishi Sunak vows to cut taxes for business to tackle cost of living crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/18/rishi-sunak-vows-cut-taxes-business-tackle-cost-of-living-crisis-cbi-speech
5/19/2022,"Nadhim Zahawi is the latest in a long line of hypocritical Tory education secretaries who urge state schools to “do better” while denying them the necessary resources (Editorial, 16 May). To add insult to injury, he implies, in spite of all the evidence to the contrary, that state-educated students who overcome difficult personal circumstances in gaining admission to prestigious universities are examples of “tilting the system” and have not been selected on merit. In fact, admitting students on merit is one of the areas in which Oxford and Cambridge universities have shown marked improvement in recent years, which explains why the proportion of students admitted from state schools is much greater than it used to be. Of course, some parents who have shelled out a fortune on school fees may feel upset if their children are only be able to go punting on the Backs as tourists and attend May balls as guests, but they should not worry. In their landmark study of 2017, carried out at the LSE, Aaron Reeves and Sam Friedman showed that if you go to the “right” school then you don’t have to worry about A-levels, university or any of that stuff – you’ll still end up in a top job.Michael PykeCampaign for State Education  How disappointing to hear a secretary of state for education spouting the worn-out rhetoric of meritocracy (Zahawi rejects idea Oxbridge should ‘tilt system’ to accept more state pupils, 14 May). Having spent 30 years as a teacher in a comprehensive, I have had the privilege of working with students who have gone on to some of Britain’s fantastic universities. In those 30 years, only a few ever applied to Oxford or Cambridge. They simply didn’t think it was a fit for them. It was too posh. These were A-grade students who could intellectually hold their own with most of those they would meet at these elite establishments. The Oxbridge idea, however great the work done there, still upholds the creaking class system of this country. So how sad to hear a government minister say the problem is one for state schools. Another levelling up promise seen for what it is – empty rhetoric.Richard DuckworthBirkenshaw, West Yorkshire  You rightly highlight the stark division between private and state schools. In light of its levelling up policy, perhaps the government should consider Frances Ryan’s proposal that private schools be stripped of their charitable status (Private schools don’t act like charities, so let’s strip them of the benefits, 16 August 2018). The money saved by the exchequer could be redistributed to state schools. Why should hard-working but poorly paid taxpayers subsidise the education of the already rich and powerful? If the present government does nothing about it, I look forward to seeing this proposal in the next Labour party manifesto.Gerald SandisonLeighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire  How ironic that, just at the time when the education secretary was trying to defend private schooling, his Eton-educated boss was revealing how the spoon-feeding of privilege has led to his own incapacity to work without constant supervision (Boris Johnson says cheese and coffee can distract when working from home, 14 May).Nigel GannLichfield, Staffordshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It is sound advice, but readers should be aware that the test is not foolproof and can miss the symptoms, as happened to me on two occasions. Had I relied on the results of the test, I’d probably not be here now, but I was concerned about some changes that had occurred and was lucky enough to see a young GP who listened to me and decided to refer me in spite the home tests showing that nothing was amiss.

5/19/2022,"Jesse Eisenberg was Oscar-nominated for his fast-talking turn as Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network – a performance that persuaded the world to think of the Facebook supremo as a garrulous, injured soul. He is also the author of accomplished stage plays, short stories and pieces for the New Yorker. Now he makes his feature film debut as a writer-director with a sweet-natured and well acted movie about Ziggy (Finn Wolfhard), an insufferable and naive teenage boy in high school, who preens himself on all the followers he has for his livestreamed folk-rock songs, with titles such as Truth Aches. His equally insufferable but idealistic mother, Evelyn (Julianne Moore), kindly, if overbearingly, runs a shelter for abused women. Secretly hurt at the way her son has moved away from her into the world of lo-fi online celebrity – Ziggy has rigged up a big flashing red light outside his bedroom to warn his parents not to come in while he’s broadcasting to the fanbase – Evelyn befriends the bewildered teenage son of one of the women at her refuge. She tells her protege how to better himself and apply for college, “grooming” him as the obedient, grateful son she never had. When You Finish Saving the World (the phrase is never used, but clearly enough conveys parental exasperation at pompous teens who lecture their elders on global issues without doing the washing up) is a movie with the indie, stonewashed look that its distributor A24 has virtually made a house style. It’s an ironic, knowing but fundamentally sentimental film, in the “coming of age” manner, whose emollient intergenerational comedy brings it very close to the gloopy world of Dear Evan Hansen. But however on the nose it is, however broadly predictable its comic beats and occasionally cartoony characterisation, it is watchable and sympathetic. Both Ziggy and Evelyn have crushes on people who are unattainable. Lila (Alisha Boe) is a cool, smart person in Ziggy’s class, clued in on radical left politics, about which Ziggy is as innocent as a child, and he makes deeply misjudged attempts to talk about this in her presence, failing to read the room. But these are the politics that once animated his mother, in whom they have evidently declined and coagulated into that sort of white-saviour do-goodery that Lila would despise. Evelyn’s crush is on Kyle (a very good performance from Billy Bryk), a sensitive, mature boy who has moved into the shelter with his mom Angie (Eleonore Hendricks), and who has a biddable, friendly personality, which Evelyn bossily latches on to. Evelyn and Ziggy are heading for life-lesson-learning broken hearts, and the film suggests that this is what is going to bring them back together. I think it only works for one half of the equation. It is plausible that the calamity of Evelyn’s project will bring her back to Ziggy, but in the real world Ziggy’s woes are likely to take him further still away from his family, the redemptive reckoning being more likely to happen much later in adult life. Also, the figure of Ziggy’s grumpy/reticent dad Roger (Jay O Sanders) is a little underwritten. But the tricky mother-son relationship is well managed and Moore always brings to this kind of Oedipal drama a seriocomic intensity (as in Tom Kalin’s Savage Grace from 2007, playing opposite Eddie Redmayne). She has a nice scene where Ziggy boisterously yells a greeting from across the street and Evelyn, with schoolteacherly reserve, says: “I will speak when you are closer.” It is a symbolic moment for them both.

5/19/2022,"More than 900 Ukrainian troops who were at Mariupol’s besieged Azovstal steel plant have been sent to a prison colony on Russian-controlled territory, Moscow has said, as their fate remains uncertain. A foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said on Wednesday evening that of the 959 Ukrainian service personnel Russia said had surrendered since Tuesday, 51 were being treated for their injuries and the remainder had been sent to a former prison colony in the town of Olenivka in a Russian-controlled area of Donetsk region. Russia’s defence ministry also released videos on Wednesday of what it said were Ukrainian fighters receiving hospital treatment in the Russian-controlled town of Novoazovsk after surrendering at the besieged Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. In the videos, a group of men were shown lying on beds in a room, and two spoke briefly to the camera. In one, a soldier said he was being treated “normally”, adding that he was not being psychology pressured. It was not possible to establish if the soldier was speaking freely. Zakharova told journalists all the wounded Azovstal soldiers “will be provided with qualified medical care”. Ukraine has not commented on Russia’s latest update. In his address to the nation late on Tuesday, the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said an “evacuation mission” was continuing with help from “the most influential international mediators”. It is also not clear how many remain inside the plant. Denis Pushilin, the head of the self-proclaimed republic of Donetsk, said on Wednesday that the “commanders of the highest level” were still hiding in the plant. Earlier, Ukrainian officials had said some of its soldiers remained. The two sides in the war have released practically no details of the agreement that led to the surrender of the troops, who were holed up for weeks in an extensive network of tunnels and bunkers underneath the steelworks. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister said on Tuesday the soldiers would be swapped in a prisoner exchange, but a number of Russian officials on Wednesday repeated statements made a day earlier by other hardliners that the soldiers should be tried. Pushilin on Wednesday called on an “international tribunal” to be set to decide the soldiers’ “fate”. “As for war criminals as well as those who are nationalists, their fate, if they laid down their arms, should be decided by the courts,” he said. “If the enemy has laid down arms, then his fate will be decided by the courts. If it is a Nazi criminal, then it’s a tribunal.” The Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, whose forces have participated in the battle for Mariupol, said the Azov regiment, one of the main forces defending the steelworks, should not be exchanged and “must be punished by law”. Speaking at an educational forum in Moscow, Kadyrov said Russian forces were facing some “difficulties” in Ukraine as a result of Nato arms deliveries to the country. It was the second statement by a Russian official on Wednesday that acknowledged some of the Russian military failings in Ukraine after Rashid Nurgaliyev, the deputy secretary of the Russian security council, said that “despite all the current difficulties, the special operation will be completed”. The Azov regiment was formed in 2014 as a volunteer militia to fight Russia-backed forces in east Ukraine, and many of its original members had far-right extremist views. Since then, the unit has been integrated into the Ukrainian national guard and its commanders say it has moved away from its far-right origins. The Russian Duma is expected to discuss the subject on Wednesday and potentially accept a new resolution that would ban prisoner exchanges of Azov fighters. Next week, Russia’s supreme court will also hear an application to designate Ukraine’s Azov regiment as a “terrorist organisation”, opening the way for sentences of up to 20 years for those convicted of involvement. Russia’s Investigative Committee, which exists to examine major crimes, has already announced plans to interrogate the surrendered soldiers, without indicating whether they would be treated as suspects. The fate of the forces taken prisoner at Azovstal could further complicate efforts to resume peace negotiations, with both sides blaming each other for a breakdown in talks. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, accused Ukraine of a “total lack of desire” to continue the negotiations, while the Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said talks were on hold . The Azov movement has been used as a key part of the Russian propaganda narrative to justify the war in Ukraine, and Andrei Kolesnikov of the Carnegie Moscow Center said Russian politicians were using their surrender “to promote themselves and show their loyalty to the Kremlin”. “But ultimately, their statements don’t matter much and it will be Putin who decides what happens to the Ukrainian soldiers,” Kolesnikov added. He said what Putin chose to do with the Azovstal soldiers could point to his current intentions in the conflict. “If he decides to try the soldiers, it will be a clear, worrying sign that he is willing to further escalate the situation. It will be a spit in Zelenskiy’s face.” Alternatively, Kolesnikov said, trading soldiers with Ukraine would be framed domestically as a Russian “act of mercy and compassion” despite the current calls by Putin’s hardliners demanding severe punishment for the soldiers. “At home, Putin has flexibility and could play both cards,” Kolesnikov said.",News/World news,Russia says 900 Ukrainian troops sent to prison colony from Mariupol,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/18/ukraine-mariupol-azovstal-soldiers-russia
5/19/2022,"Donald Trump’s sway over the Republican party continues. On Tuesday, Republicans again paid heed to the ex-president’s endorsements even as they declined to march in lockstep. Flecks of daylight emerged across the primary battlegrounds. Still, Trump has little to worry about. His fantastical claim that the 2020 election was stolen is firmly entrenched as Republican Gospel. In North Carolina, Representative Ted Budd received Trump’s seal of approval, and won the Republican nod for US senator with nearly 60% of the vote. Budd was a Trump loyalist when it counted most. In January 2021, the congressman sided with the majority of his House Republican colleagues. He voted to deprive Joe Biden of his win. Before Budd received Trump’s endorsement, he had been trailing – just like JD Vance in Ohio. Over in Pennsylvania, Trump is the reason that Mehmet Oz is still standing. Right now, “Dr Oz” holds a 0.2% lead over David McCormick, a hedge fund titan who Trump savaged as a China-loving globalist. Fewer than 2,700 votes separate the pair. Kathy Barnette, a conservative commentator with a murky résumé and described by Trump as unelectable, has third place, all to herself. The race has not yet been called. A recount is almost certain. If Oz loses, he can blame Barnette, who exposed him as a latecomer to the Maga-verse. Once upon a time, the doctor was a Harvard-educated, pro-choice physician who served in Turkey’s army. America First, not so much. To be sure, Oz is an acquired taste who suffered from a popularity deficit heading into the primary. Among Republicans, his favorability stood underwater, 37%–48%. Significantly, Oz led among those who cast their ballots on primary day itself, as opposed to early voters. At the beginning of the evening, McCormick actually held a double-digit lead thanks to mail-in ballots, an advantage which evaporated as the night wore on. Beyond that, Oz showed particular strength in Trump’s Pennsylvania strongholds. To illustrate, he ran well in Luzerne county, a so-called “pivot county”. Nestled in the north-east part of the state, Luzerne went for Barack Obama by five points in 2012. Four years later, Luzerne delivered a nearly 20% margin to Trump, and with it the Keystone state. On Tuesday, Oz captured 41% of Luzerne’s Republican primary vote, and ran ahead of McCormick there by better than 10 points. The falcon heard the call of the falconer. Elsewhere, not so much. Oz failed to win the counties in and around Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. Out west, in Idaho, Brad Little, the incumbent Republican governor, beat back a challenge from Janice McGeachin, Idaho’s Trump-endorsed lieutenant governor, and a favorite of the far right. On the issues, McGeachin managed to surpass Little’s hostility toward mask mandates. She also advocated increased in-state production of weapons and ammunition, and delivered a video address to the America First Political Action Conference. Some perspective is in order. Nick Fuentes, a white nationalist, organized the conference. McGeachin wore it as a badge of pride. Significantly, Idaho’s outcome stands as a harbinger for the upcoming Georgia governor’s race. Brian Kemp, the incumbent, faces a challenge from David Perdue, a former US senator who is Trump’s designated attack dog. Trump loathes Kemp and Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s secretary of state. In 2020, the pair refused to “find” Trump votes after his defeat. Right now, Kemp is favored over Perdue, who lies about the outcome of November election and his own recent defeat. Meanwhile, a grand jury is examining Trump’s post-election conduct. And then there is Madison Cawthorn, North Carolina’s over-the-top congressman. He went down to defeat after videos of his alleged nude antics hit the internet. Republicans were unamused. By contrast, Cawthorn’s earlier visit to Hitler’s vacation home did not move the needle. In the hours and days ahead, expect Oz and McCormick to garner continued media attention. But come November, another contest in Pennsylvania will also grab its share of the spotlight – the race for governor. Douglas Mastriano is now the Republican gubernatorial candidate. Unlike Oz and McCormick, Mastriano truly believes the Maga message. It is a tenet of faith. As a candidate, he championed Christian nationalism, espoused election denialism and flipped the bird at efforts to curb Covid’s spread. A Pennsylvania state senator and a retired colonel, Mastriano has pledged to appoint a Maga secretary of state to oversee Pennsylvania’s election machinery. He also vowed that his secretary of state would “reset” the voter rolls. Fittingly, Mastriano attended the 6 January rally. He and his wife watched as a rioter stormed a police barricade. They did not enter the building, but the House select committee has subpoenaed him. Mastriano makes some Pennsylvania Republicans nervous. They predict his presence may cost the Republican party control of the governor’s mansion and the Senate. Then again, inflation still rages, the possibility of a recession looms, the stock market wobbles. Populist rage propelled Trump to the White House. History can repeat itself. If empowered, Mastriano will do all that he can to make it happen. Lloyd Green is an attorney in New York.

Cruise was slim, focused and understatedly athletic in dark sweater and trousers; he submitted to good-natured softball questioning from French journalist and Cruise superfan Didier Allouch. Cruise was very serious about cinema and there were no racy and indiscreet anecdotes. Questions about romance or religion were clearly off the table. But there was something lovable about Cruise’s pure energy and lack of cynicism. He told us about shooting the same particular erotically charged scene with Nicole Kidman in Eyes Wide Shut for Stanley Kubrick dozens of times. “Really, Kubrick made you do it again and again?” asked Allouch, unwisely attempting ironic humour on the theme of Kubrick’s legendary perfectionism. “Oh yes,” said Tom, not getting this attempted joke at all. He was asked if there was any pressure from the suits and the bean-counters to take Top Gun: Maverick straight to small-screen streaming. “Let me tell you,” said Tom, “that’s NOT GONNA HAPPEN!” Screaming and cheering from all of us. He also told us how it was his habit to have meetings with everyone on a film set to learn about their work and ask: “What’s your job? How can I help you?” Only a lunatic would tell Cruise to go away and let him or her get on with, say, the location catering - because there’s a worryingly good chance that Cruise would actually know a lot about it. Allouch asked him why in recent Mission: Impossible films, it’s the supporting cast and not Cruise himself who get to do the latex-unmasking-thing. “What can I tell you?” Cruise replied. “Simon Pegg REALLY wanted to do the mask! How can you say no to Simon, right?” We whooped. Then Allouch became serious and asked him about doing all his own super-dangerous stunts. “You are a family man with children!

5/19/2022,"The World Bank plans to spend $12bn (£9.6bn) to support low-income countries hit by shortages of food and fertilisers that have pushed prices higher since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Sudan, where inflation has rocketed above 250%, is expected to be among the countries that will benefit from the initiative, which the Washington-based organisation said should alleviate shortages over the next 15 months. The World Bank said the $12bn pledge would raise its overall commitment of unspent funds to $30bn, from a budget of $170bn, as it seeks to prevent low-income countries from being hit by famine and political unrest. In recent days, the UN World Food Programme’s director has warned that war, extreme weather and Covid-19 are driving global food prices to levels “that will cause social unrest in some parts of the world”. Nigeria, sub-Saharan Africa’s most populous country, has experienced a rise in inflation rise to a more modest 16%, though food inflation topped 18% last month, leading to calls for the government to increase support for low-income households. The World Bank said new and existing projects would receive $30bn – covering areas such as innovative agriculture, water and irrigation schemes, and higher welfare payments to the poorest families. Its president, David Malpass, said loans would allow farmers to fund investments in new methods of food production with lower use of fertiliser. Governments that have reacted to the crisis by restricting exports of food – such as India – were castigated by Malpass for making the global situation worse. He said that to increase next season’s production, there needed to be lower trade barriers, a more efficient use of fertilisers, and “repurposing public policies and expenditures to better support farmers and output”. Malpass urged governments “to make clear statements now of future output increases in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine”. He added: “Countries should make concerted efforts to increase the supply of energy and fertiliser, help farmers increase plantings and crop yields, and remove policies that block exports and imports, divert food to biofuel, or encourage unnecessary storage.” David Beasley, the head of the UN World Food Programme, said: “If people can’t feed their children and their families, then the politics unsettles.” Hit by high prices and supply disruptions, Beasley said the UN had been forced to ration food supplies to millions of people around the world. “If we’re not there with a safety net programme, then the political extremists or whatever the case may be, will exploit that,” he said, adding: “Next thing you know, you’ve got riots, famine, destabilisation and then mass migration by necessity.”",News/Business,World Bank pledges $12bn to support low-income countries hit by shortages,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/18/world-bank-pledges-12bn-to-support-low-income-countries-hit-by-shortages
5/19/2022,"The alleged sexual offences for which a Conservative MP has been arrested include one connected to someone aged under 18, it has emerged as Labour called for the MP to be identified. The man in his 50s has been bailed after being arrested on Tuesday over accusations of rape and sexual assault offences spanning seven years from 2002 to 2009. He has not been suspended by the Conservative party but Chris Heaton-Harris, the chief whip, asked him to stay away from parliament. One of the accusations is an allegation of abuse of position of trust, under a law that forbids sexual activity with anyone under 18 by someone who is an adult and in a role of trust or authority over the young person. Police do not usually name people who have been arrested but not yet charged. A series of privacy court cases mean media organisations also rarely do so. On Wednesday Boris Johnson’s press secretary rebuffed questions on whether the MP should be proactively barred from Westminster or lose the Conservative whip, saying it was “a matter for the whips”. Johnson only learned of the allegations on Tuesday while his whips are understood to have known for longer. “The prime minister was shocked to learn of these allegations,” his press secretary told reporters. Asked when he found out, she said: “As far as I know, the prime minister was informed yesterday.” Keir Starmer’s spokesperson said it “doesn’t seem to be sustainable to argue” that the MP should not lose the whip. When questioned on the fact this would inevitably result in the MP’s name emerging, the spokesperson said: “It’s a matter for the Conservative party what they do but our view is that given the nature of the allegations then the whip should be suspended and obviously at that point it would become public.” Jess Phillips, a shadow Home Office minister, told BBC Radio 4’s World At One the procedures appeared imbalanced. “There is just a gap in the process here that currently, in my view, favours ... the individual who is accused, charged or convicted against the balance of the safeguarding and safety of the other 6,000 people who work here and in fact their constituents as well,” she said. “The reality is the Speaker of the House of Commons can only ask this person not to come here. That’s it.” In another intervention, one of the lay members of the Commons standards committee, which deals with complaints about MP, said the ongoing situation with the MP was “a calamity”. “It’s all very well to ask him to stay away, but what about the many constituency venues where that is not applicable?” Rita Dexter, a former deputy commissioner at the London Fire Brigade, said. “What consideration has been applied to those?” If such a thing had happened in the fire service, “without hesitation I would have approved a suspension from work”, she added. “It’s hard on those who are not judged not guilty, but it’s still the best course of action.” In a statement, the Metropolitan police said on Tuesday evening: “In January 2020, the Met received a report relating to alleged sexual offences having been committed between 2002 and 2009. The offences are alleged to have occurred in London. An investigation is ongoing, led by officers from Central Specialist Crime. “A man, aged in his 50s, was arrested on suspicion of indecent assault, sexual assault, rape, abuse of position of trust and misconduct in public office.”",News/UK news,Rape accused Tory MP’s alleged offences include one relating to person under 18,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/18/accused-tory-mp-alleged-offences-include-one-relating-person-under-18
5/19/2022,"Rob Key has backed England’s new red-ball regime to “unlock” the latent talent in their underperforming Test players after naming a first squad of the Brendon McCullum era complete with a combination of fresh faces and the familiar. With much attention focused either on the recalled James Anderson and Stuart Broad or on the uncapped Matthew Potts and Harry Brook, perhaps the most intriguing innovation as England go into next month’s three-match series against New Zealand will see Ollie Pope come in at three, having never in a first-class career that now runs to 103 innings batted higher than No 4. Pope averages 72.73 from 54 knocks for Surrey, mostly batting at four, but has averaged only 28.66 across 40 Test innings for England in which he has appeared only three times in his favoured position. However, England’s selection panel of McCullum, the new captain, Ben Stokes, and Key, the managing director of England men’s cricket, have concluded he has the makings of an ideal international No 3. “We feel that Ollie Pope is the man,” Key said. “With a lot of these guys now, the bet is that with the talent they have, this environment, these coaches, can get the best out of our most talented cricketers – and Ollie Pope is one of those. If we can unlock him, which I think they can, there’s a seriously good Test cricketer there.” England have won only one of their past 17 Test matches, but Key insists many misfiring players will flourish under the team’s new management. “There’s some seriously talented cricketers in this country,” he said. “We just need to unlock them and get them playing to the best of their ability. I’m betting on the fact that someone like Brendon McCullum, or Ben Stokes, and a clear vision for how we want to play is the way to do that.” With Joe Root reverting to batting at four after a brief flirtation with No 3, Jonny Bairstow pencilled in at five and Stokes at six, as a middle-order batter Brook may struggle to convert his blistering start to this season’s County Championship into a place in the starting XI. But amid an injury crisis among English bowlers Potts, a teammate of Stokes at Durham, is more likely to get a chance. “There’s a lot of people who can run in and get the ball down there at various different paces, but when you start seeing someone like that emerge, the way it looks like if you’re facing him you’re in a proper contest, these are the people I get really excited about,” Key said. “Some good will come out of the injury problems that we’ve got at the moment, and it may be him. It’s definitely a concern and we need to look into why this is happening, but I like the look of this Matt Potts. They have all the data and all of that stuff over the last few years but that’s a reflection of history whereas this year, I’m pretty excited by what he offers. We see him as a point of difference.” Key also promised an end to the policy of regularly resting Anderson and Broad, the team’s two senior bowlers, who have respectively played nine and six of England’s 14 Tests in the past 12 months and were completely left out of the squad that toured the West Indies in March. “I think we’ll try to get the most out of them that we possibly can,” he said. “If they’re part of the best bowling attack I’d rather have them in the side, trying to win games of cricket for England, than prolonging their careers when they can’t impact as much as possible. I think we’ll try to make the most of them while we’ve still got them.” The issue of how to deal with ageing players is also one that will be faced by Matthew Mott, the Australian who was confirmed at England’s white-ball coach on Wednesday. At last year’s Twenty20 World Cup 13 of the 17 players used by England were above the age of 30 while their captain, Eoin Morgan, will be 40 when Mott’s four-year contract expires in 2026. Key is not hiding from the need to eventually transition beyond Morgan’s inspirational leadership. “The process was about [finding] someone who wasn’t going to come in and disrupt that environment. They have a very strong leader in Eoin Morgan, but whenever there is a transition in leadership they are the right person to take it into the next era,” Key said. “That was the criteria we looked for and Matthew came out at the top of the list for that.” Key argued that the fact the white-ball team will be secondary to the Test side at times – including next month when they play three one-day internationals in the Netherlands while the red-ball squad are focused on overcoming New Zealand – will force them to experiment with fresh personnel. “It’s not really about the 11 players, it’s about the philosophy and the way they play,” Key said. “It’s so clear in that side, and that’s what we want to get in Test cricket. It’s clear how they go about playing their cricket, and that has filtered right the way through the system into the T20 Blast and county cricket, so there’s a whole production line of batsmen in particular coming through. I think the coach has got to be smart to work out who to invest in for the future, and I think we’ve got the right person in Matthew Mott.”",Sport/Sport,Rob Key backs new England regime to unlock ‘serious talent’ in first Test squad,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/18/rob-key-backs-new-england-regime-to-unlock-serious-talent-in-first-test-squad
5/19/2022,"As the formula shortage continues to grip the US, many parents have been left struggling to access the product they rely on to feed their babies. At the start of May, 43% of baby formula was out of stock at retailers, according to Datasembly, a product data firm. One mother, speaking to the New York Times, described the situation as “a nightmare”. Here’s a look at how the problem started, what parents can do and what the FDA and government are doing to try to end the shortage. In February, Abbott Laboratories, maker of popular baby formulas, closed a manufacturing facility in Sturgis, Michigan, after it recalled infant formula products when a federal investigation started after four babies taking the formula developed bacterial infections, two of whom died. Abbott has said there is no link between its formula and the illnesses. Baby formula was already being affected by pandemic-related supply chain problems, but the Michigan plant closure “really exacerbated things”, said Dr Christopher Duggan, director of the Center for Nutrition at Boston children’s hospital. Some Republicans have falsely suggested shortages are down to the Biden administration sending baby formula to undocumented immigrants. Steven L Schooner, a professor of government procurement law at George Washington University told the New York Times that the amount purchased for migrants, “is statistically the equivalent of zero in terms of market share”. Some states are facing more severe shortages, including Tennessee, Texas and Iowa where more than 50% of the top-selling products are out of stock, according to CBS. The crisis is hitting poorer families disproportionately hard. Nearly half of baby formula in the US is bought under the Wic program, aimed at helping low-income women, infants and children. States give exclusive contract rights for this formula to one company under a bidding process. Abbott provides formula to about half of the babies receiving Wic benefits. When these products disappeared, families were left scrambling to find alternatives. There are racial disparities, too. Rates of breastfeeding are lower for Black babies than white babies, according to a 2019 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Black women are more likely to live at or below the poverty level and more likely to return to work sooner, the report states. “Those women are less likely to have flexibility in their jobs to be able to pump and express milk,” said Dr Ann Kellams, a University of Virginia faculty pediatrician and board president of the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine. “They are the ones I worry most about right now. They are going to be the ones who are less likely to have a relative in a pocket of the US where they still have enough formula on the shelves to send it to them.” When Kellams talks with families, she explains: “This is a really difficult situation to be in. It’s hard enough to be a parent to a baby, infant or toddler, and it’s OK to use a different brand of formula than you’re used to using.” For children with a medical condition that is treated with formula, however, parents must talk with their pediatrician or a pediatric registered dietitian to ensure a switch will be safe and well tolerated, said Duggan. If a mother has been partially breastfeeding and their baby is four months old or younger, there are also ways to boost production but parents should see a lactation consultant or breastfeeding medicine physician, said Kellams, whose organization published a list of recommendations. Other guidance includes: Do not share formula or breastmilk with people online who you don’t know or trust. Only put as much formula in a bottle as you think the baby will take because you can always add more. Do not dilute formula to maintain supply because it could mean babies don’t get the nutrients they need. Families could soon see some relief. The FDA and Abbott have reached a proposed settlement that would allow the company to reopen the closed Michigan facility, with oversight from an independent expert, according to the agency. The company stated it could restart the site within two weeks and that it would then take an additional six to eight weeks before its products are available. The FDA has also announced a series of measures designed to increase supply. On Monday, the agency said it would implement processes to make it easier for foreign baby formula manufacturers to sell their products in the US. Currently the US produces about 98% of formula domestically. The FDA will also, on a case-by-case basis, ease some of the requirements it puts on formula companies, for example around labeling. House Democrats have proposed a bill that would provide the FDA with $28m to address the shortage, according to the Washington Post. But it’s unclear if Republicans would support the spending measure. Four companies control about 90% of the US baby formula market – Abbott (which accounts for nearly half the market), Mead Johnson Nutrition, Nestlé USA and Perrigo. Only 2% of formula is imported and FDA rules make it very hard for new companies to enter the market. The fact that there are so few companies means that when one factory is shut down, it creates a domino effect, Kellams said. A letter to the agriculture secretary, Tom Vilsack, from eight senators including Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren stated: “The infant formula industry has reached an alarming level of corporate concentration.” Some are calling for federal action to tackle the monopoly a handful of companies have on the formula market. Booker, Warren and other senators call for immediate antitrust review in their letter to Vilsack, writing: “This is yet another example of how alarming levels of consolidation hurt American families and can no longer be ignored” Kellams and Duggan also call for policy changes to better support breastfeeding mothers. The US is the only industrialized nation that does not mandate paid maternity leave. “It’s very difficult to successfully breastfeed your child and still go back to work,” said Duggan. “There are a lot of things that our government and policy makers could do to support breastfeeding families.”",News/US news,"Why is there a baby formula shortage in the US, and what can parents do?",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/18/baby-formula-shortage-why-is-there-none-what-to-do-causes-explained
5/19/2022,"Shoppers are changing their behaviour as family budgets come under pressure from swingeing price rises on basic necessities, from milk and cooking oil to dog food. Jane Jones, who works in a supermarket in Flintshire, Wales, says cash-strapped customers are looking for ways to cut back. “It’s completely different in the shop. There are some people that don’t have to worry about money but the average person is spending less and people are always complaining about prices at the checkout. Some people know when [the store] puts out reductions. They come to the store at 8pm and you can see crowds of people at the reductions counter climbing over each other to get what’s cheap. When there is something in the aisles that is on offer, people buy what’s cheap that week and don’t have it the next. We used to get shoplifters stealing high-value things to sell on, which is not uncommon. Now it’s people stealing everyday things, doing their weekly shop and trying to walk out without paying. Baby milk has never been security tagged but now it is, so people can’t steal it. It was something that never would happen before but people are quite desperate. There is a lot going [missing] through self-service: people not scanning everything is more prevalent than it was. There are definitely a number of things that never had security tags before but have got them now. A lot of things have been removed off the shelves. We put cards out for things such as printer ink and you have to go and get it from a secure area. A lot of people do say “when you get to £40 can you stop”, and then we look at their offers to see if they can buy more. You can see them prioritising what they need at the front [of the conveyor belt]. There have always been people who shop like that, who only have a certain amount of money to spend. It is not a new thing but it is definitely happening more with people who didn’t generally bother before and were carefree and just buying what they needed or wanted. Now people are very cautious about cost. The supermarket has value lines and [premium] lines and people tend to pick up more value brands now, which was something they seemed to be stopping doing a while ago. We find lots of things left at the end of the checkout – people are thinking they shouldn’t have picked it up and changed their mind. It must be hard for them but we don’t make them feel bad. We are in the same boat, we understand as we are not in high-paid roles. I try to shop smart. I spend a lot of time in the supermarket so I see the offers and buy fewer treats, such as the odd bottle of wine. You don’t plan meals around what you like but what you can afford to buy, what’s on Bogof (buy one, get one free) or reduced. Everything seems to have gone up in price a little bit. Some things, such as cat food, have gone up massively. When you are going around it’s maybe 5p here and 10p there but when you get to the checkout with 50 items in the trolley, that is a lot of money.”",News/Business,A view from the checkout: ‘baby milk is now security tagged’,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/18/a-view-from-the-checkout-now-its-people-stealing-everyday-things
5/19/2022,"Sweden and Finland have formally submitted their applications to join Nato but Turkey blocked an early move to fast-track the Nordic countries’ requests, demanding they extradite “terrorists” and that the alliance respect its concerns. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, accepted the two historically non-aligned Nordic countries’ membership requests, each in a white folder embossed with their national flag, at the US-led defensive alliance’s HQ in Brussels on Wednesday. “I warmly welcome the requests by Finland and Sweden to join Nato. You are our closest partners,” Stoltenberg told the two countries’ ambassadors, hailing the occasion as “a historic step” and “a good day at a critical time for our safety”. However, multiple reports cited diplomatic sources as saying Turkey later blocked a vote by Nato ambassadors on opening talks immediately, suggesting the first stage of the accession process may take longer than the two weeks the alliance planned. The enlargement of Nato must be approved by all 30 members and then ratified by their parliaments, which could take up to a year. The alliance has said it wants to move as fast as possible given the potential Russian threat to Finland and Sweden. The two countries’ applications represent a radical redrawing of Europe’s security landscape in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and, if successful, would represent the most significant expansion of Nato in decades, doubling the alliance’s border with Russia. Stoltenberg said Nato would “take into account the security interests” of all members and was “determined to work through the issues and reach rapid conclusions”. All allies agreed on the importance of enlargement, he said, adding: “We all agree we must stand together and that this is an historic moment we must seize.” In Ankara, however, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan told MPs from his AK party the alliance must respect Turkey’s reservations. “Nato expansion is only meaningful for us in proportion to the respect that will be shown to our sensitivities,” he said. Turkey accuses Sweden and Finland of harbouring members of Kurdish militant groups it considers terrorist organisations, and also objects to their decisions in 2019 to ban arms exports to Ankara over Turkey’s military operations in Syria. Erdoğan accused Stockholm in particular of providing safe haven to members of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) and to followers of Fethullah Gülen, who Ankara accuses of orchestrating a 2016 coup attempt. “We asked them to extradite 30 terrorists, but they refused to do so,” he said. “So you won’t give us back terrorists, but you ask us for Nato membership? Nato is an entity for security, an organisation for security. Therefore, we cannot say ‘Yes’ to this security organisation being deprived of security,” he added. Erdoğan said Nato had never supported Turkey in its fight against the PKK and other Kurdish militant groups, and accused allies of supporting terrorists, citing allied arms deliveries to the People’s Defence Units (YPG), a Kurdish militia fighting in Syria. Other Turkish officials, including Erdoğan’s spokesperson, have been less outspoken, saying Turkey has not shut the door to Sweden and Finland joining Nato but wants negotiations and a pledge to clamp down on what it sees as terrorist activities. Nato, the US and other allies, as well as Helsinki and Stockholm, have all said they are optimistic they can overcome Turkey’s objections. Analysts believe Erdoğan, who faces elections next year, is largely seeking concessions to score domestic political points and is ultimately unlikely to veto the two Nordic applications. In the hope that speedy ratification by the US would help advance the process, the Swedish defence minister has already headed to Washington. The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, was due to meet the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, in New York on Wednesday, while the Finnish president, Sauli Niinistö, and Sweden’s prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, will meet the US president, Joe Biden, on Thursday. In a statement, Biden said he strongly supported the two countries’ application, adding that he would work with the US Congress and Nato allies “to quickly bring Finland and Sweden into the strongest defensive alliance in history”. Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, said on a visit to Rome that she hoped alliance members would move “as soon as possible” to ratify the applications. “I think this is the key issue when it comes to security, as fast a ratification process as possible is the best security guarantee for Finland and for Sweden at this stage,” she said. Germany said on Wednesday it would push for the quickest possible accession of Sweden and Finland to Nato. “In these two countries, we gain two valued and capable allies who will further strengthen the defence capability of our alliance,” a government spokesperson said. Rome also said it strongly supports Finland’s and Sweden’s applications and was willing to speed up procedures for the two countries to join as soon as possible, the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, said, calling the applications “a clear response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the threat it poses to peace in Europe”. Moscow’s response has so far been muted, with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, describing Finland’s and Sweden’s accession as not a threat in itself. Only the deployment of military infrastructure on their territories would provoke a response, Putin said.",News/World news,Turkey blocks early vote on Sweden and Finland joining Nato,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/18/sweden-and-finland-formally-apply-to-join-nato
5/19/2022,"The attack on Black shoppers at a grocery store in Buffalo was carried out by an 18-year-old white man who authorities say was engaged in “racially motivated violent extremism”. The shooting left 10 people dead and is being investigated by the US justice department as a hate crime. Reports suggest the shooter had legally purchased multiple firearms, detailed his plans for the attack online for months, and claimed he was motivated by the “great replacement” conspiracy theory, a racist and false idea that white Americans are being deliberately replaced by immigrants. He has been arrested and charged in the slayings. The massacre comes amid a rise in anti-Black hate crimes in the US, where murders committed by white supremacists and far-right individuals have dominated extremist violence in the last four years. Brandi Collins-Dexter, a senior research fellow at Harvard’s Shorenstein Center who studies disinformation and formerly advocated with civil rights group Color of Change, spoke to the Guardian about how the massacre is rooted in America’s long history of white supremacist violence and racist conspiracy theories. What was your initial reaction to the news? You’re just horrified to see the community’s pain. But I also think about the things we could have done as a society for us not to be here. It’s incredibly disturbing, distressing and frustrating that we’re still here after so many different episodes throughout history and in the last 30 years. I also think about the fact that this grocery store in a Black community became a target of violence and how that will have traumatizing implications for many. I live in Baltimore, and the day after the massacre, I went grocery shopping in a white area. I didn’t feel safe going into my normal grocery store. What should we take away from this happening in upstate New York? As a country, we still seem stuck on this idea that systems of racism and economic segregation are southern or rural things or tied to specific places. But what we see in Buffalo and what we’ve seen in Syracuse – where my family is from – and what we’ll continue to see is that there isn’t a geographic confinement to the systems of harm. There are individuals across regions invested in ideas of “extermination” who are willing to go to any means necessary to carry it out. In Buffalo, I also think about all the systems that put members of the Black community in that particular grocery store at that time – how the highways were built, forms of economic segregation or how that area was a food desert for a long time before the community lobbied to get that store built. You tweeted that people should stop saying, “This is not who we are as a country,” which we hear so often after horrific tragedies. Can you elaborate? I remember watching live footage of the insurrection on January 6, and seeing signs with sic semper tyrannis, the Latin phrase meaning “thus always to tyrants”. That’s a very specific frame. John Wilkes Booth said it before he assassinated Abraham Lincoln in 1865. We saw it 130 years later in 1995 when Timothy McVeigh murdered 168 people in an Oklahoma City bombing and was wearing a shirt with the phrase. We keep seeing it pop up, and it feels very present here. When we talk about misinformation and disinformation online, it’s like a 21st-century spin on the same problem of conspiracies spreading in different communities. Throughout history, we’ve seen how people defined as white react when they believe there is a threat to their way of life, whether KKK members running for school boards in the 1920s or the resurgence of the Confederate flag in the 1950s. We see what happens when the conspirators are the people in power who perceive a loss of power. So it really does us a disservice to act like these things are strictly in a container. What if we said to ourselves, this is who we are as a country? How would that change how we approach systems, politics and what we do to try to prevent this from happening again? What’s behind the significant rise in white supremacist extremist killings in recent years? The modern iteration of the “great replacement theory” stems from Barack Obama’s election and the toxic reactions to the first Black president and what that meant for white people in the US. That combined with the rise of big tech platforms and sites like Telegram, information overload online, data voids and context collapse that we see in pockets of the internet where people are living in these Petri dishes. Those are the conditions that allowed us to go from Timothy McVeigh in the 1990s to the consistent trend we see now. It’s happening so often that the news cycle can’t keep up, people can’t keep up and we can’t fully make sense of it. What does that normalization look like? I anticipate we’ll continue to see an increase in these killings, absent any sort of sweeping set of interventions. That is what feels really scary to me. I thought January 6 would force a conversation, but it didn’t. Stuff got normalized. Every day, it feels like the floor is getting lower, and our expectations for what is acceptable in society change, and we’re willing to accept more and more. And in the partisan politics of this environment, we’re not legislating and we’re not tackling these issues online. It’s really grim and frightening. How should we understand the modern Republican party’s role in this environment? When you look at the Buffalo suspect’s “manifesto”, it’s kind of a cut-and-paste job from the 2019 Christchurch, New Zealand, mosque shooting that killed 51 people. It has inspiration from Ted Kaczynski, also known as the Unabomber, 4chan memes and discussions about “human biodiversity”, which is a type of pseudoscience that has long been used to develop tropes and associations about Black people. These elements aren’t all neatly tied to the Republican party. But what the Republican party has done is created a political home for some of these extreme fascists and mainstreamed some of this ideology. We’ve seen this with certain Republicans supporting the January 6 insurrection. When you look at this history of anti-Blackness – this othering – we see that the Buffalo massacre is deeply embedded in an American tradition of defining Black people as a stranger in our own land. It’s about who defines America and who defines the US. You see this in media narratives, cultural products, who gets platformed and who is protected in free speech conversations online. These are all conditions that allow for people to feel like they own the rights to define who is American and who gets to live or die in America. That can’t be strictly confined to the Republican party. How does the “great replacement” conspiracy theory tie to anti-Black racism in America? It’s easier to think of the “great replacement theory” as something that’s confined to immigrants, but it has a long history in anti-Black racism. There’s the 1857 Dred Scott decision that proclaimed Black people were not citizens in this country. There’s the pseudoscience used to justify the absence of adequate medical care. These ideas are implicit in 4chan memes, in “accelerationism”, in “eco-facism”. It’s about a whole cabal of things, but time and time again, anti-Blackness comes to the forefront. Black people are still by far the largest group of victims of hate crimes.It also tends to be underreported in the media just how frequently Black people are under attack in our homes, communities, on the street and in the grocery store. It’s an unignorable element in the fight to define what a true democracy is in a country that is still grappling with this multiracial experiment. How should our leaders be responding at this moment? How can we make progress? We need gun control. We still haven’t answered the question of why someone needs to have the type of weapons that he was carrying. And then there’s the fight around critical race theory as the shorthand for telling a story of America that acknowledges its unsavory aspects and the tapestry of who has contributed to it. The absence of that storytelling in our education system allows somebody to convince themselves that they are the true savior of this country and have the right to take other people’s lives. This isn’t just a political football. There are deeper implications when somebody gets to overhaul curriculum and fire teachers in the name of a skewed story of America. We have tech companies that are too big to regulate and can’t regulate themselves, and we see how these companies have become a platform for fascist regimes carrying out violence or individual killers. We have to tackle that question. It is marginalized communities, Black people and the people with the least amount of power who are paying the cost.",News/US news,How the Buffalo massacre is part of US tradition: ‘We’ll continue to see killings’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/18/buffalo-shooting-us-tradition-history-white-supremacist-violence
5/19/2022,"My friend Vladislav Shoot, who has died aged 81, considered himself a Ukrainian-born Russian-British composer. Slava belonged to the post-Shostakovich generation of Soviet composers who emerged in the late 1950s and 60s, the time of Nikita Khrushchev and the early Leonid Brezhnev regime. Soviet commentators called such composers “avant garde” or “modernist”, but they were really just looking for freedom to move beyond the stale demands of Stalinist “socialist realism”. They wanted to make something new. Vladislav Shut – he later chose the transliteration “Shoot” to avoid mispronunciation – was born in the southern Ukrainian city of Voznesensk, the son of Alexei Shut, a naval officer, and Valentina (nee Nizovaya), neither of whom were interested in the arts. Due to the nature of his father’s work, Vladislav went to several secondary schools, including one in Georgia and School N14 in Sevastopol, where the family settled. Growing up on the shores of the Black Sea, he discovered music by himself, and this led him to the Gnessin State Musical College in Moscow, where he studied, with the composer Nikolai Peiko, graduating in 1967. For the next 20 years or so, as well as producing a scattering of film scores, Vladislav earned a living as an editor at the Moscow music publishing house Sovetskii Kompozitor, while building up a catalogue of his own music. At the heart of the first half of his career are the first four of his seven chamber symphonies, compositions that caused official irritation for their quirkiness and unpredictability, and his chamber-orchestral Romantic Messages (1979), which provoked similar annoyance for playing “disrespectfully” with the opening of Mozart’s 40th Symphony. This piece, and several others from the same period, include virtuoso parts for solo bassoon, reflecting the young Vladislav’s friendship with Valery Popov, a pioneer of woodwind playing in the USSR. Another important composition of this same period was Ex Animo (1988) for large orchestra, which he himself considered autobiographical. He met Irina Karpey, an artist, in Moscow in 1969; they married the following year. In 1992, they and their two young children moved to Dartington Hall in Devon, where Vladislav was composer-in-residence for two years. He settled there, becoming a British citizen in 1999, and completing another large orchestral composition, High Cross Symphony (1998), named after the modernist house of that name on the Dartington estate. It was commissioned by the BBC Symphony Orchestra and premiered under the conductor Martyn Brabbins, a champion of Vladislav’s music, at the Royal Festival Hall in December 2000. In company, Slava was warmly hospitable, with a chuckling laugh, a terrific knowledge of literature and a fine repertoire of Russian jokes, but underneath there was always stillness and humility. It was for the stillness – so different from their earlier life in Moscow – that he and Irina so loved the landscapes around Dartington. “Paradise”, he called it, and, come rain or shine, they went walking every day. Vladislav is survived by Irina, their children, Veronika, a pianist, and Eli, a composer, and five grandchildren.",Arts/Music,Vladislav Shoot obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/18/vladislav-shoot-obituary
5/19/2022,"The chief executive of Aviva, Amanda Blanc, has told of her shock at being on the receiving end of misogynistic comments at the insurer’s annual meeting last week, saying the incident could prompt a wider rethink on how boards interact with shareholders in future. Blanc was the target of sexist remarks from individual shareholders at the Aviva AGM in London, with comments from the floor that she was “not the man for the job” and that she should be “wearing trousers”. Aviva chair George Culmer responded to the remarks, saying he was “flabbergasted”. The following day, Blanc, who has held a number of senior roles in insurance over 30 years, warned that sexism in the finance industry was increasing. She wrote on the networking site LinkedIn: “The more senior the role I have taken, the more overt the unacceptable behaviour.” Blanc, who is the first female chief executive of Aviva and is the government’s women in finance champion, told the Guardian: “It’s really important that investors get to grill the Aviva board on decisions they’ve taken or the way the organisation is being run. What’s clearly not acceptable is some of the comments.” She added: “I’m sure there are many boards preparing for their AGM thinking about how they might deal with that. We prepare a lot of things for all the business meetings that we do, including our AGM. We did not prepare for misogynistic comments. We just didn’t. In 2022, in that sort of forum, you would not have expected that.” Blanc said she had received many private messages of support from male and female FTSE chief executives and chairs, some of whom had experienced sexism themselves. Her LinkedIn post had received 1.6m views and 825 comments the last time she looked, “from all sectors, all industries, all genders, people expressing their support but also reliving their own stories”. She added: “More role models, more women in senior roles and more ethnic diversity in senior roles will obviously make a difference.” Blanc is one of only a handful of female FTSE 100 bosses. A recent report by the Women in Finance initiative found that at the current rate, it will take until 2050 to reach gender parity at senior levels of Britain’s financial services industry. Blanc described this as “absolutely outrageous”. When Blanc took the helm at Aviva in July 2020, the share price was 273p; it has since risen to 417p. She slimmed down the business to focus on the UK, Ireland and Canada, selling eight divisions for £7.5bn in the past year and returning £4.75bn to shareholders. In its latest quarterly results on Wednesday, the firm posted its highest general insurance sales in a decade, and boosted UK customer numbers by 100,000 to 15.4 million. “We’ve seen good support from our shareholders and hopefully they’ve benefited from the improvement in the share price over the period and the focus of the business and what we’ve achieved so far,” Blanc said. “And that’s what I want to be judged by, what I’m not prepared to be judged by is the fact that I am a woman, I’m not a man standing on the stage there.”",News/Business,Aviva CEO tells of shock at sexist remarks from shareholders at AGM,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/18/aviva-ceo-tells-of-shock-at-sexist-remarks-from-shareholders-at-agm-amanda-blanc
5/19/2022,"Britain’s inflation rate has soared to the highest level since the early 1980s. After a record increase in gas and electricity bills in April, inflation is the highest in the G7. Having reached 9% last month, it is above the 8.3% rate in the US and Germany’s 7.4%. Japan, an economy characterised by low inflation for decades thanks to an ageing population, has the lowest rate at 1.2%. Here are some of the reasons why prices are rising faster in the UK than in other major economies. Britain is a net importer of energy, meaning it is exposed to global price shocks. The post-lockdown surge in oil and gas prices, exacerbated by Russia’s war in Ukraine, is no exception. However, some other countries have done more in response. France has a 4% cap on electricity price rises, helped by state ownership of the energy producer EDF. The country also sources the majority of its energy needs from nuclear. Italy has a windfall tax on energy firms and is spending €8bn (£6.8bn) to shield consumers from higher bills. Spain and Portugal are capping gas prices after winning approval from the EU. Germany has cut fuel tax by 30 cents a litre, compared with a Britain’s 5p cut. Ireland has cut public transport fares by 20%, while Spain and Belgium have cut VAT on energy bills – something Boris Johnson claimed could be done after Brexit, but has failed to enacted. The UK government has announced £22bn of support for high energy costs for the current financial year, including cuts to fuel duty, a council tax rebate and repayable loans on energy bills. The measures do not, however, influence the headline inflation rate. Labour says the UK is the only country in the G7 where the government is raising taxes in the middle of the cost of living crisis, after the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, pushed through an increase in national insurance contributions last month. Britain is a highly open economy with total trade equivalent to 60% of GDP. The UK’s manufacturing base is also smaller than countries such as Germany and Italy. Disruption from the pandemic, along with China’s “zero Covid” policy, has pushed up freight prices and caused costly delays. However, companies in Britain face additional costs from Brexit, with reams of paperwork and border delays adding to the pressure. The EU accounts for about half of total imports. Though just under half of food consumed in Britain is produced domestically, including the majority of grains, meat, dairy, and eggs, much comes from the EU. The thinktank UK in a Changing Europe estimated post-Brexit trade barriers pushed up food prices by 6% between December 2019 and September 2021. The pound has slumped in recent months, dropping to the lowest level against the US dollar since the early days of the pandemic. This will add to inflation by driving up the cost of imports. Fewer foreign workers are seeking jobs in the UK after Brexit, while many older people left the workforce during the pandemic. Labour shortages are leading companies to increase pay, adding to their wage bills, and leading them to raise the prices they charge for goods and services. Unemployment has fallen to the lowest level since the mid-1970s, with the number of people out of work below the number of vacancies for the first time ever. Annual average pay growth, excluding bonuses, has risen to 4.2%, among the fastest rates for a decade. The Bank of England believes domestically generated inflation is higher in Britain than in the EU, where wage growth in the year to the final quarter of 2021 was 1.6%. However, it is less pronounced than in the US, where one measure of wage growth hit a record high of 6% in March. However, average pay growth is still failing to keep pace with the soaring cost of living.",News/Business,Why does the UK have the highest inflation in the G7?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/18/why-uk-highest-inflation-g7-ukraine-covid-brexit
5/19/2022,"Two of Britain’s largest pub groups have warned that punters may have to pay more for a meal and see fewer discounts on the menu as they struggle to absorb rising energy and food costs. The pub and restaurant group Mitchells & Butlers, which runs pub chains including O’Neill’s and restaurant brands such as Harvester, said it was facing a difficult trading environment. Its rival Marston’s said it was working to mitigate inflationary rises through a combination of cost-cutting and “pricing strategies”. “Cost headwinds present a significant challenge to the industry, particularly those costs related to utilities, wages and food,” said Phil Urban, the chief executive of Mitchells & Butlers. Mitchells & Butlers, which has 1,600 UK venues and also runs chains including All Bar One and Toby Carvery, forecast that its costs for the full year would be about 11.5% higher than in 2019, lifting its cost base above £2bn from £1.8bn previously. It predicted its costs could rise by another 6% next year, depending on the volatility in energy markets. The London-listed hospitality group said it had already bought about 80% of the energy it will need for this year, and about 10% of next year’s requirement. Urban said the company had already increased some of its prices by about 3% in April, but had chosen not to introduce “blanket price rises”. “We tend to be a little bit more sophisticated than that; we try to protect entry dishes and entry products and we try to put more premium offers on to allow people to ladder up through the menu if they want to. And by doing that, you can drive spend,” Urban said. Marston’s, which runs about 1,500 pubs, said it had reduced the numbers of dishes and menus available in its venues, after a review that it said had allowed it to be more confident in its pricing decisions. The company is also phasing out its cheapest two-for-one food offer. Despite this, Marston’s warned that higher costs would “inevitably” have an impact on its full-year earnings. “We are navigating our way through cost increases,” said Marston’s chief executive, Andrew Andrea. “The pub remains the home of affordable socialising and has continually proven its resilience in previous times of economic challenge.” Both Mitchells & Butlers and Marston’s said they had not yet noticed their customers cutting back on spending or visiting less frequently, as the cost of living crisis begins to bite. “I wouldn’t be able to point to any change in behaviour at the moment,” said Urban. “In previous recessions, this sector has proved to be fairly resilient as people tend to protect their social lives, and it is more luxury goods that tend to go by the wayside. But it is early days and we are very conscious that utility bills are probably now hitting.” Other hospitality businesses said they were currently absorbing higher costs, but warned it would knock their profits. “Electricity has more than doubled, food is about 15% [higher] and labour costs are about 7%-8% [up],” said Clive Watson, chair of the City Pub Group, which runs 45 pubs across southern England and Wales. “If we are not raising our prices for our food and drink – and we don’t think that it is the right thing to do at the moment – then we are going to take these costs on the chin,” Watson told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.",News/Business,UK pub chains warn of price rises due to increase in food and fuel costs,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/18/uk-pub-chains-warn-of-price-rises-due-to-increase-in-food-and-fuel-costs
5/19/2022,"A Russian tank commander has pleaded guilty to shooting dead 62-year-old man as he rode his bicycle down a village road, in Ukraine’s first trial for war crimes committed during the Russian invasion. Vadim Shysimarin, 21, sat emotionless as prosecutors detailed charges that he had fired his AK-47 at the unarmed cyclist from the window of a car in the north-eastern Sumy region in late February. Prosecutors have moved fast. It is extremely unusual to hold a trial while a conflict is still ongoing, and unprecedented to do it within weeks. The victim was shot dead less than three months ago, in the first days after the invasion. But Ukraine has made seeking justice for atrocities committed by Russian troops a priority. National prosecutors are risking their own lives to collect evidence of war crimes even in areas still threatened by enemy forces or laced with mines. The case is being heard by three judges, who must reach an unanimous verdict for the suspect to be convicted and sentenced, even after the guilty plea. He faces life in jail for the killing. They will hear testimony from two witnesses. One is the victim’s wife, who was in the court to watch Shysimarin acknowledge murdering her husband, and another is the Russian soldier who was in the car with him at the time of the shooting and was later taken prisoner by Ukrainians. They will also be presented with evidence including the alleged murder weapon, in hearings expected to last two days. Shysimarin comes from Ust Illyinsk in the south-east Irkutsk region of Russia and was a commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division on the day of the killing, 28 February, in Chupakhivka village. Prosecutors say a group of Russian soldiers shot at a civilian vehicle after their convoy came under attack from Ukrainian forces, then stole the car and drove it away. They later came across the unarmed victim, who was talking on his phone just a few dozen metres from his own home. One of the men in the car told Shysimarin “to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders”, according to prosecutors. He opened fire out of the car window, and shot down the man. That instruction to open fire could not be considered a military order that might protect him from responsibility, prosecutor Andriy Syniu told journalists outside the courtroom. “The person who gave an ‘order’ isn’t his commander. He was aware of that. The person who gave the instruction was aware of that. Before they got into the vehicle they didn’t know each other,” Syniuk added. Ukrainian prosecutors have the support of several teams of international investigators and forensic experts, but face a mammoth task. Over a thousand bodies have been unearthed from mass graves in the town of Bucha alone, and dozens of rapes have been reported. Ukrainian prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova is preparing over 40 cases for war crimes trials, and authorities say they have registered more than 10,000 war crimes, including attacks on hospitals. Large swathes of Ukrainian territory are still under Russian control, and abuses have been widespread in all areas liberated from its forces to date, so the toll is expected to rise considerably if other areas fall back under Kyiv’s control. Human Rights Watch also said on Wednesday that it had documented further “apparent war crimes” by Russian troops around Kyiv and Chernihiv regions, including 22 apparent summary executions, nine other unlawful killings, six possible enforced disappearances and seven cases of torture. One of the few precedents for holding a trial while a war is still raging comes from the Balkans. A Bosnian Serb soldier, Borislav Herak, was captured by Bosnian army soldiers, put on trial for 35 killings and 14 rapes, and convicted of genocide and crimes against civilians. Senad Kreho, who was president of a district military tribunal in Sarajevo in 1993, said the legal system functioned fairly even though the war was still ongoing. “Numerous subsequent reviews of [Herak’s] case by international and national legal experts found that he was given a fair trial,” Kreho told the Associated Press. Two further unnamed soldiers are expected to have a first hearing in Ukraine within days, facing allegations they used a Soviet truck-mounted 122mm multiple rocket launcher to shell homes and civilian buildings in Kharkiv district. Another case will be heard in absentia shortly. A soldier named as Mikhail Romanov is accused of rape and murder. Russia, which calls the invasion a “special military operation” denies its soldiers have committed war crimes.

5/19/2022,"Artist-poet Jesse Darling’s recent survey show at Modern Art Oxford took a swipe at the tidy authority of museum displays. Glass-topped cabinets teetered and slumped into corners, metal stands refused to do just that, and an exuberant – if terrifying – rollercoaster sculpture looped the upper reaches before unravelling into splayed track. The programming of that show directly after an exhibition by Anish Kapoor – an artist who delights in impeccably controlled materials – felt gleefully pointed. Coming swiftly afterwards, Darling’s Enclosures at Camden Art Centre is a rather different animal. The result of a ceramics fellowship that took place more off site than it might have under less Covidy circumstances, the show translates the artist’s interests in vulnerability and care into the exploration of clay. The material appears in many guises. London clay – the primordial gunk oozing stickily beneath our capital – turns up as London bricks, which map out a pattern of walls and entrances on the floor. Coarse yellow clay has been made into clumsily formed hands, which protrude from the walls fired and unfired. Clay as a processed industrial product manifests as cool white tiling, transforming one wall of the gallery into that of an old public toilet. The elite material in this lineup is porcelain, crafted into little plump-buttocked doll bodies in radiant white. The clay body forming each element, and the nature of its participation in the structure Darling has built, thus becomes a metaphor for the human body. The rough clay hands scrub dirty smears from the white bathroom tiling. Concrete and London bricks invite us into – or keep us out of – various parts of the gallery. The porcelain dolls are displayed under bell jars, or kept on a high shelf safely out of reach. Darling’s earlier works, such as The Ballad of Saint Jerome (shown at Tate Britain in 2018) expressed the vulnerability of the body in terms of sickness and damage, and explored the power relationship that emerged between the carer and the cared for. In Darling’s reimaginings of the legend of Saint Jerome, the lion becomes distinctly ambivalent at being beholden to the hermit. In honouring Saint Jerome for pulling a thorn from his foot, the lion in the legend has to repress his own nature and become a friend to man. In accepting care the lion must also accept a loss. In Enclosures, vulnerability appears more as a social construct, and care occupies a sliding scale that ranges from parental concern through corporate surveillance to the threat of bodily violence. Cameras of various kinds are mounted around the gallery. You don’t really notice them at first: we are now so accustomed to surveillance cameras tracking us in London that these plastic-clad electronic eyes barely register. A tiny portable monitor for a nanny-cam is strapped to one of the concrete pillars. Its camera is trained on the shelf of porcelain doll bodies in an approximation of hands-off parental care. It becomes apparent that we, too, are being filmed: from many angles, and perhaps with less benign intent than the dolls. The footage from one camera positioned over the (barbed-wire-topped) entrance door is projected on to the wall, behind a tiny paper maquette of a shed behind a white picket fence. Walking to the other end of the space, beneath a white lace pelmet, we encounter a small old-fashioned box television transmitting footage of the gallery behind us. Red vinyl hieroglyphs are stuck next to each camera, and across various sections of wall. Some are struck-through clusters of lines, like a prisoner counting down the days. Others seem to be approximating text, as though making an unsuccessful attempt at communication: “Hi!” “Surveillance Cameras in Use” “Smile, you’re on CCTV!”. Perhaps these emblems of control have gone a little rogue, like Darling’s wayward wobbly furniture? Two glass cabinets contain old wood and metal hammers decorated with coloured ribbons and bells, like babies’ rattles, jesters’ batons or morris dancers’ sticks. They are tools of violence or construction dressed up as distracting toys. Are they a threat or a way to break free of the system? Or both? It is not such a leap from making work about the unwell or damaged body to making work about a body submitted to various forms of state control (even if that control is imagined to be for our own good). We cannot place a firm partition between the political and the emotional spheres: an oppressive environment plays out in the physical body. This is not easy art. Darling has taken on a tricky task, laying down a thoughtful route to address particularities of the body without sliding into identity politics. Navigating it is exhilarating.",Arts/Art and design,"Jesse Darling: Enclosures review – part public toilet, part CCTV-infested hellscape",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/18/jesse-darling-enclosures-review-part-public-toilet-part-cctv-infested-hellscape
5/19/2022,"The cost of living crisis will trigger an increase in crime and officers should use their “discretion” when deciding whether to prosecute people who steal in order to eat, the new chief inspector of constabulary has said. “The impact of poverty, and the impact of lack of opportunity for people, does lead to an increase in crime. There’s no two ways about that,” Andy Cooke said as inflation hit a 40-year high of 9%. When asked how policing could avoid being seen as the arm of an uncaring state, he said forces across England and Wales were skilled in dealing with the tensions and dynamics of their communities. “What they’ve got to bear in mind is what is the best thing for the community, and that individual, in the way they deal with those issues. And I certainly fully support police officers using their discretion – and they need to use discretion more often.” Cooke said he was not advocating an amnesty for people who commit crimes of poverty, nor “giving a carte blanche for people to go out shoplifting”. Instead, he advised officers to make sure such matters of law enforcement are “dealt with in the best way possible”. In a wide-ranging interview, Cooke also said: Every burglary victim should get a visit from the police. Forces may be marked down by the inspectorate if they fail to do so. The charging rate should more than treble, from the current 6% to at least 20%. The criminal justice system is failing victims of rape. Policing is still recovering from cuts inflicted by Conservative-led governments from 2010. The chief inspector of constabulary is the head of the independent assessor of police forces in England and Wales. Cooke, a former chief constable of Merseyside police, took over from his predecessor Sir Tom Winsor last month. Past economic slumps have led to a rise in offences such as theft, and Cooke said surging inflation and fuel costs were likely to eat away at police budgets. Speaking on the cost of living crisis, a key issue that will have knock-on effects for policing in the coming months, Cooke said: “I think whenever you see an increase in the cost of living or whenever you see more people dropping into poverty, I think you’ll invariably see a rise in crime. And that’s going to be a challenge for policing to deal with.” He believes that rank-and-file officers should be trusted to use their own judgment in some cases. “It’s one of the great things about being a police officer, you’re allowed to make your own decisions in relation to all of these issues. It’s not a new thing,” he said. But this did not mean an amnesty for certain crimes, he added. “There’s always individual cases where you can use your discretion that doesn’t necessarily result in a prosecution but is dealt with in the best way possible. And the shoplifting one’s a good example, isn’t it?” One chief constable whose area includes pockets of poverty agreed with Cooke. “There is a difference between a first-time offender who steals bread, cheese or milk to eat, and someone stealing to feed an addiction,” they said. “Police are there to help people in extreme need, that’s why we joined. We can signpost them to a food bank or help like that.” Away from the cost of living, Cooke said the charging rate for recorded offences at 6% was far too low and he expected a dramatic increase. “I think it’s not unrealistic to aim for 20%. That’s a realistic expectation in my view.” He would not put a timeframe on reaching that target, but said: “I think when we have a return of 20,000 police officers and those officers have had an opportunity to be properly trained, with sustained financial support from the government, I think that’s a realistic ambition.” As part of boosting confidence in policing, Cooke said every burglary victim should get a visit from police to scour for fingerprints and other forensic evidence. He said this was necessary and achievable“because burglary is an exceptionally invasive crime”, often offering “forensic opportunities”. He said: “After you’ve suffered such a crime as burglary, the expectation should be that as a victim you get professional service from policing. So when I was a chief that was my expectation, and that expectation doesn’t change now.” He said the inspectorate would consider marking forces down if every burglary victim does not get a visit. “If I got burgled, I would be absolutely devastated if all I got was a phone call.” Charge rates for rape stand at barely above 1% and Cooke accepted victims were being failed. “Any charge rate that sits around 2% in relation to such a serious offence must mean there is a failure somewhere.” Policing suffered from years of cuts and is nowunder pressure from the current Conservative government and the public to boost crime fighting. Cooke said forces were still recovering from the cuts but things were beginning to return to a “better position”. However, it would take “some years” for the 20,000 extra officers currently being recruitedto become effective, he said. Figures show public confidence in the Metropolitan police, Britain’s largest force, is at its lowest on record. Only 49% of Londoners thought local police did a good job, down from 68% in March 2017 when Cressida Dick became commissioner. Cooke said the inspectorate would try to stop forces falling into crisis and was currently inspecting the Met.",News/UK news,"Officers should use discretion over stealing to eat, says police watchdog",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/18/officers-should-use-discretion-over-stealing-to-eat-says-uk-police-watchdog
5/19/2022,"Growing up, we’re supposed to think our parents aren’t cool. With my father, Ron Stewart, Stew to his friends, who has died aged 80, this was impossible. He once returned home from a trip, casually mentioning he had just bought an entire country’s rug production. The country was Nepal, the rugs were made from nettles, and no one had brought them to Europe before. This was entirely normal for Stew, a quietly extraordinary man. Stew started out with rugs and textiles that he sold first wholesale and then at Liberty in London, where he worked from 1989 until 2000, running the carpet department. In time “the shop” created the oriental department for Stew to sell items from around the world. Japanese pottery, Indonesian furniture, fetish masks from West Africa – he learned about them, sought them out, and sold them all in the shop. Along the way his buying found him in Kabul in 1979 as the Russians invaded, or eating eyeball stew with the Bedu somewhere in the High Atlas. Nothing fazed him (apart from any technology invented after 1920), and neither did his lifelong diabetes, an illness he largely ignored despite it at times landing him in hot water – like having to be flown by helicopter to hospital from a train on the Ukrainian steppe, at night, in winter. Just another work trip, he said when he made it home. Stew was born in Haywards Heath, West Sussex, to Jane, a hospital librarian, and Ian Stewart, an RAF pilot turned sewing machine salesman. He went to Tottenham grammar school and then the School of Slavonic and Eastern European Studies of London University (which is now part of UCL). With a degree in Russian and “getting by” in seven other languages, Farsi and Arabic included, Stew was largely self-taught, and was still studying philosophy and French when he died. He was also highly creative. When he was not reading about the Abbasid Caliphate or the art of revolutionary China, he would be at his loom weaving carpets, hangings and, for the last few years of his life, a series of paintings in wool - landscapes, drawn from his imagination - that hang on the walls of many friends. A polyglot but not a polymath, my father was not concerned with how things worked, but rather why things were. He loved cities and was happiest sitting in a hide birdwatching. He immersed himself in history and was a staunch modernist. He was leftwing and bought and sold luxury. He was fiercely clever and watched Bergerac on repeat. He was a committed atheist deeply moved by Orthodox liturgy. And amid all the contradictions, complexity and often downright stubbornness, he was a loyal and caring father to his three children. He is survived by his wife, Bev (nee Harries), whom he married in 1969, and their children – Rachel, Ruth (known as Hooch) and me – and six grandchildren.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Ron Stewart obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/18/ron-stewart-obituary
5/19/2022,"Writer-director Kirill Serebrennikov brings his intense sympathies to the unhappy figure of Antonina Miliukova, estranged wife of composer Pyotr Tchaikovsky, in a part once taken by Glenda Jackson in Ken Russell’s 1971 film The Music Lovers. Serebrennikov’s movie imagines Antonina as selfish, fanatical, naive, narcissistic and self-indulgent, not to say antisemitic, but also as the most wronged-genius wife since Sophia Tolstoy, or, indeed, Constance Wilde. As often in the past, this director’s film-making inhales or intuits the characteristics of its subject, and so it becomes almost oppressively hysterical and highly strung, like Antonina or Tchaikovsky himself. But the movie also becomes bizarre when it dramatises the reputation that Antonina acquired for sexual obsessiveness, with dozens of well-built naked men brought into the screen for balletic fantasy sequences. But the nymphomaniac reputation was given to Antonina, surely, by malicious well-connected men and intimates of Tchaikovsky who had a vested interest in undermining her. Alyona Mikhailova is tremendous in the role of Antonina, an unhappy young woman from a troubled, shabby-genteel Moscow family who studies music briefly under Tchaikovsky and falls fanatically and hero-worshippingly in love with him – with all same the religiose devotion as that of the holy fool beggars in the streets. To the very end, she resembles a serious-minded little girl. Tchaikovsky, played by Odin Biron, is a blandly conceited man who is at first embarrassed by Antonina’s brazen and desperate suggestion of marriage. But he then comes to see that her promised dowry (the sale of a family forest) would help him out of a financial jam and that marriage would quieten the gossips, because Tchaikovsky is gay – as he almost, but not quite, warns Antonina before the proposition is made, telling her he could love her only “as a brother”. Poor Antonina cannot grasp the truth about her husband’s sexuality and the film persuasively suggests she simply refuses to accept that, or anything else that might bring about divorce and the destruction of her divine destiny: to be Tchaikovsky’s wife. Absurdly, she imagines herself as his future handmaiden, amanuensis or guardian, but instead she is bewildered and upset by the crowds of boisterous male cronies that seem to surround her new husband at all times, laughing at something she doesn’t understand. The wedding dinner is a funeral, the conjugal duties are a nightmare and soon Tchaikovsky withdraws from her in fastidious disgust – and Antonina pursues him as fiercely as Glenn Close did Michael Douglas in Fatal Attraction. The film certainly brings home Antonina’s terrible loneliness: she is apart from Tchaikovsky for most of the film, but is mentally chained to someone who hates her. There is a brilliant fantasy scene at the very beginning where Tchaikovsky rises from the dead to berate those people who had allowed her in to look at his corpse. Poor Antonina’s emotional life is confined to a sordid and joyless affair with her lawyer. She condemns herself to a life at the margins of Tchaikovsky’s celebrity: she is the unwanted outsider who she once imagined herself protecting Tchaikovsky against. This is undoubtedly a vehement and very watchable drama – far superior to Serebrennikov’s previous film, the sprawling and unrewarding Petrov’s Flu. If there is a narrowness in its emotional and final range, that gives it force.

5/19/2022,"It took Mohammed more than three years and a journey of more than 5,000 miles to reach the UK after fleeing a massacre in his village in Sudan. Now, just over a week after arriving by kayak across the Channel, he is among the first tranche of asylum seekers facing forced removal to Rwanda, on the continent where his journey began. A “notice of intent”, sent by the Home Office, warns that Mohammed (not his real name) has 14 days to register reasons why he cannot be relocated under the government’s controversial new scheme. He is believed to be the first of about 50 asylum seekers in his position to speak out. The 25-year-old said: “I wanted to reach the UK because I heard it was a place where I could be safe. We started hearing that the UK government was planning to send people who arrive in small boats to Rwanda but we didn’t believe they would do this.” He said the prospect of travelling to Rwanda, after fleeing Sudan via Libya, had triggered flashbacks. “I thought the UK was a good country with a lot of humanity,” he said. “I’m shocked that the Home Office is not treating me like a human being. “I haven’t been able to sleep since I arrived here. My trauma is getting worse and I’ve been having more flashbacks about what happened to me in Sudan and Libya since I arrived in the UK. It was so hard for me to escape from Africa and now the UK government wants to send me back there.” Mohammed said he left Sudan in January 2019 after a brutal attack by Janjaweed militia on his village. “It was horrific,” he said. “Many people were killed, girls and women were raped and others were kidnapped. Those like me who survived the massacre escaped as soon as we could.” He travelled from Sudan to Libya and spent a year there, where he said he was exploited by traffickers. Libya is a popular transit country for refugees from places such as Sudan and Eritrea who are trying to reach Europe by crossing the Mediterranean in small boats to Italy. “I was controlled by traffickers in Libya. They held us in some overcrowded, underground place and forced us to do farming work,” said Mohammed. “After a year I managed to escape. Some people were shot when they tried to escape from the traffickers. Since that time in Libya I have developed a lot of breathing difficulties. I also have difficulty sleeping, suffer many flashbacks and suffer from a lot of trauma.” In 2020 he crossed the Mediterranean, passing through Malta and other countries before reaching northern France. He said that during much of his journey through Europe, he had to sleep in the streets. After arriving in Calais, he said he and 10 other refugees from Sudan made repeated attempts to cross the Channel in a kayak designed for four people because they were too poor to pay smugglers for passage in a larger, sturdier dinghy. “We tried many times to cross but sometimes our boat sank so we had to go back to France,” said Mohammed. “Life was so hard in Calais, especially in the winter when it was very cold sleeping outside. Eleven of us finally managed to cross the Channel in a kayak. The journey was very difficult and we were lucky to survive because the waves were so high.” They made it to Dover, where Mohammed said they were processed by Home Office officials and tested for Covid. He and four other Sudanese men he travelled with were taken to a detention centre and given a notice of intent about being offshored to Rwanda. “I was so shocked when I found out the government wants to send me and other refugees to Rwanda after all the years it has taken me to get here. I feel so sad after all that I’ve been through that I’ve put in a place like a jail in the UK. It’s not right in this world,” he said. The PCS union, which represents Home Office staff, is challenging the department’s new offshoring policy along with NGOs Care4Calais, Detention Action and Freedom From Torture. Clare Moseley, the chief executive of Care4Calais, said: “The one thing that all refugees have in common is that something truly terrible has happened to them. Now they are facing the further trauma of deportation across the globe. Sending them to Rwanda will abuse their rights, cost taxpayers millions and break international law. We are fighting it and we need public support.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “The world-leading migration partnership with Rwanda means those making dangerous, unnecessary and illegal journeys to the UK may be relocated to Rwanda to have their claims for asylum considered and to rebuild their lives there. The first group of illegal migrants have received notices of intent. Depending on their circumstances, they will have up to 14 days to submit reasons on why they should not be relocated to Rwanda.”",News/UK news,‘I thought the UK was a good country’: Sudan massacre refugee faces removal to Rwanda,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/18/i-thought-the-uk-was-a-good-country-man-faces-removal-to-rwanda
5/19/2022,"It was a big primary voting night, as several states determined their party candidates for gubernatorial and federal offices, Stephen Colbert noted on Tuesday evening. The Late Show taped before results were available – “by the time this airs, the victors will be celebrating, and the losers will be saying that they’re the victors,” the host joked. Tuesday was especially important for Republicans, as the party is “choosing its direction for 2022: original recipe nutballs or extra crispy cuckoo cojones”. Colbert zeroed in on the Pennsylvania GOP Senate race, a “battle royale” between the hedge fund executive Dave McCormick, TV doctor Mehmet Oz, and former radio talkshow host Kathy Barnette. Oz, the candidate backed by Donald Trump, reminded voters on the eve of the primary that the former president had called him “smart and tough”. “Because there is nothing more impressive than being called smart by a man who stared directly at an eclipse,” Colbert quipped. Oz topped the polls leading up to the election, which as of this writing remains too close to call. That’s in large part thanks to Barnette, who made a big push in the final days despite a history of homophobic and Islamophobic statements – “or possibly because of that”, Colbert noted. Barnette defended her bigoted statements on Fox News this weekend, calling the tweets “not even full thoughts” and “not even full sentences”. “See? She’s a perfectly qualified candidate for US Senate who cannot finish a sentence,” Colbert deadpanned. Barnette also dismissed the criticism because the tweets were around 10 years old. “Ok 10 years, but keep in mind: Kathy Barnette is a 50-year-old woman,” Colbert noted. “That’s like saying ‘look, we all say and do stupid things when we turn 40! It’s that carefree 22nd summer after high school.” Barnette was also caught on tape marching with the Proud Boys, a far-right extremist group, during the attack on the Capitol on January 6. “So she tried to overthrow an institution, and now wants to work there?” Colbert marveled. “That’s like holding up a bank saying, ‘put the money in the bag, also this seems like a pretty good gig. Could I drop a résumé off with you guys?’” On Late Night, Seth Meyers touched on reports that Joe Biden, who was first elected to the Senate in 1973, has told aides in private that he no longer recognizes the Republican party and views them as an existential threat to democracy. “Oh good, you’re all caught up,” Meyers deadpanned. “This is like when you watch three episodes of a show and you have to wait for your partner to watch them before you can move to episode four.” Speaking in Buffalo, where a gunman targeted and killed 10 black people this weekend, Biden called on Congress to pass new gun control laws. “Also today, a tree fell in the forest,” Meyers said, shaking his head. In a new interview, Dr Anthony Fauci criticized the Trump administration’s handling of the pandemic, saying it “wasn’t optimal”, which is “kinda like saying the Hindenburg experienced a flight delay”, Meyers joked. And Fox announced on Monday that The Masked Singer will return for an eighth season “because they need somewhere to put all the people too embarrassing for Dancing with the Stars”, Meyers said. And on the Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon opened with news that the FDA authorized the first at-home Covid test that can also detect the flu. “That’s amazing. Now you can be kinda unsure if you have everything,” Fallon said. “The accuracy of an at-home test is somewhere between seeing a doctor and searching WebMD. “Good news is we have the test right in time for flu season: mid-May,” he joked. “Here’s how it works: you do a swab at home, then you send it to a lab, then you get the results a week later after you’ve infected everyone you know. It’s really genius.” Fallon also looked at a viral clip of a Mexican student asking Pope Francis about his injured knee, to which the pope answered: “I need a little bit of tequila for my leg.” “Probably explains why an hour later the popemobile was spotted at a Taco Bell drive-thru,” Fallon said. “Vatican officials were shocked but the pope was like, ‘relax, I only drink when I smoke.’ “All this time his staff thought he was talking about a cardinal when he referred to his friend Don Julio,” he joked. And Disney announced a new ad-supported version of Disney+, though it will not show ads for politics or alcohol to keep the platform family friendly. “They should reconsider that,” Fallon advised. “I mean, there’s no better time to offer parents alcohol than during the 20th rewatch of Encanto.”",Arts/Culture,Stephen Colbert on future of the GOP: ‘Original recipe nutballs or extra crispy cuckoo cojones’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/may/18/stephen-colbert-future-republicans-primaries
5/19/2022,"The crypto crash will not reduce the sector’s climate impact any time soon, an economist has warned, even though the environmental footprint of digital currencies is in theory set by their market value. “Unless bitcoin collapses further, there’s no reason to expect a decrease in environmental impact,” said Alex de Vries, a data scientist at the Dutch central bank and the founder of Digiconomist, which tracks the sustainability of cryptocurrency projects. His research shows that while the increase in a cryptocurrency’s price encourages more computer capacity to be dedicated to it – increasing carbon emissions – that capacity takes a long time to disappear after the value declines, so the climate impact persists. Cryptocurrencies work by validating their transactions through huge numbers of “miners”, who use their computers to solve extremely complex maths problems in exchange for the chance of getting tokens as a reward, in a highly energy-intensive process. De Vries estimates that the bitcoin network uses about 204 terrawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity per year, around the same as the energy consumption of Thailand and above that of all but 23 sovereign nations. Other cryptocurrencies add to that footprint: ethereum, the token that underpins the NFT boom and the “decentralised finance” sector, has an annualised footprint of around 104TWh (equivalent to Kazakhstan, more than all but 34 nations), while even dogecoin, a lighthearted spinoff of bitcoin famed for its community’s positive attitude, consumes an estimated 4TWh annually. Those figures have barely changed over the past month despite $1tn being wiped off the crypto sector, and other measures of the amount of processing power devoted to “mining” similarly show little decline. All major cryptocurrencies use electrical power in rough proportion to the price of the token because that dictates how much the reward given to miners is worth. For bitcoin, for instance, the reward for successful mining is 6.25 bitcoin every 10 minutes – currently, about $210,000. The higher the value of the reward, the more energy it is worth using to try to win it, ensuring that as the price of bitcoin rose from $8,000 in October 2019 to $60,000 two years later, the energy use of the sector rose too, from 73TWh to its current high. But while an increase in the price of cryptocurrency quickly leads to an increase in the carbon emissions of the sector, a crash like the one seen in past month doesn’t do the reverse. “It likely stops the environmental impact from going up any further,” said de Vries, “but a bitcoin price of $25,200 is sufficient to sustain an annual electricity consumption of 184TWh.” A stablecoin, like the name suggests, is a type of cryptocurrency that is supposed to have a stable value, such as US$1 per token. How they achieve that varies: the largest, such as tether and USD Coin, are effectively banks. They hold large reserves in cash, liquid assets, and other investments, and simply use those reserves to maintain a stable price. Others, known as ""algorithmic stablecoins"", attempt to do the same thing but without any reserves. They have been criticised as effectively being backed by Ponzi schemes, since they require continuous inflows of cash to ensure they don't collapse. Stablecoins are an important part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. They provide a safer place for investors to store capital without going through the hassle of cashing out entirely, and allow assets to be denominated in conventional currency, rather than other extremely volatile tokens. That’s because the cost of cryptocurrency mining is split over two main areas: buying the hardware, and paying for electricity. When prices are on the rise, miners buy new computers – expensive graphics cards for ethereum, or purpose-built “rigs” for bitcoin – but once they are already set up, it’s worth switching them off only when the cost of electricity alone is higher than the expected revenue. In a paper published in the journal Joule last year, de Vries estimated that a massive crash in the price of bitcoin, back down to $8,000, would be required to meaningfully reduce the total emissions of mining – and even then, it could sustain an energy consumption of up to 60TWh per year. The continued turmoil in the cryptocurrency markets means the sector may have further to contract. On Wednesday morning, tether, a stablecoin that effectively functions as a bank, paid out a further $1.5bn to depositors withdrawing their cash from its coffers. In the past week, the slow-motion bank run has seen $9bn of its reserves withdrawn, more than 10% of its total market cap and well over twice the cash-on-hand it declared it had at the beginning of the year. Andreessen Horowitz, a prominent venture capital firm and one of the key financial backers of the cryptocurrency sector, said on Tuesday that we may be entering a “crypto winter”, echoing a warning from the Coinbase chief executive, Brian Armstrong, that valuations may be depressed for some time.",News/Technology,"Crypto crash unlikely to reduce its climate impact, expert says",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/18/crypto-crash-unlikely-to-reduce-its-climate-impact-expert-says

5/19/2022,"You’d think a person would remember why they were admitted to intensive care and nearly died, even if that person was a politician, with one of those notoriously short memories. In April 2020, just over two years ago, Boris Johnson could have become our late prime minister. Another life snuffed out by Covid-19 to add to the daily death toll. Others in his circle caught the virus, but for him it was nearly fatal – in part because his obesity made him highly vulnerable to the disease. Johnson himself said this. It’s not a matter of debate. In the aftermath, and to his credit, he launched another anti-obesity strategy. There have been a lot of them, but more on that later. This time, the government’s proposals looked promising, aimed at curbing the heavy marketing of junk food that ends up in children’s stomachs and turns into the internal fat that surrounds adult organs, causing chronic illnesses. I’ve seen the X-rays. It’s not pretty and it kills. And this grim spiral costs NHS England at least £6bn a year. Experts agree that it’s the easy availability and low cost of highly calorific, sugary, salty, fatty food that has to be tackled if obesity is to be reduced. The supermarket shelves loaded with biscuits and sweets and crisps. The takeaway outlets with high calorie ready meals swimming in grease. Telling individuals to just lose weight is no good at all – and unfair. The highest numbers of overweight and obese people are found in the poorest and most deprived communities. It’s the devil’s own bargain: unhealthy food is tasty and cheap. People are used to eating pies or fried chicken and chips, filling up between meals with salty or sugary snacks. We develop the taste for such foods, the kids clamour for them, and so many families short on money buy processed food and skip the fruit and vegetables, which cost more. Junk food is heavily promoted and discounted. That was what Johnson pledged to tackle in the wake of his hospital stay. But now the government is dragging its feet over some of the key measures that everyone applauded when the strategy was introduced in July 2020. The ban on multi-buy offers, such as BOGOF (buy one, get one free) deals on foods high in fat, salt or sugar, is postponed until October next year – 12 months after it was supposed to come in. The other key measure, a ban on online adverts to children and TV advertising of such foods before the 9pm watershed, is delayed until January 2024. Why? Because families are struggling with the cost of living, says the government. And to give industry “time to prepare”. The implication is clear: deprived families should carry on buying cheap junk food that endangers the health of their children. Health campaigners are in despair. They have been calling for these particular measures for decades now, only to see them snatched away at the 11th hour. “Our appetite cannot cope with what food companies are throwing at it. We are programmed to seek out calorie-dense food, and we eat too much of it and it’s making us sick,” said Henry Dimbleby, the independent author of the government’s national food strategy. But it’s not just health campaigners who are raising the alarm. Senior Tory politicians are lining up to condemn this delay, which they know could well be a permanent U-turn. William Hague denounced the change of plan in the Times as “intellectually shallow, politically weak and morally reprehensible”. One in five children are obese by the time they are 11, “their chances of living a long and healthy life already impaired,” he said. He called it a national disgrace. Lord Bethell, a Tory minister at the Department of Health until September last year, called the delay “unconservative” and suggested it would be hard for the bans to be put into force now before the next election. Also writing in the Times, he said that without good health, people could not fulfil their potential. “They are less economically productive, less able to create and care for a family, more likely to need medical and financial support from the state, and more likely to die young.” He was concerned, too, he said, at the burden imposed by obesity on the NHS. Obesity massively increased in the 1980s, in Thatcher’s “have it all” Britain. The seminal Foresight report on its causes and effects in 2007 laid out what every investigation since has confirmed, that changes are needed to our whole food environment. But no government has done enough. Too many voluntary agreements have been made with the food industry. Too few restrictions on sales and promotions have been enforced. One obesity strategy after another has failed to deliver. A Cambridge study published last year identified 14 government-led obesity strategies in England from 1992-2020, containing 689 wide-ranging policies. And still the overweight and obesity figures rise. The latest delays are unpardonable. If the government is really worried about struggling families’ bills, then do something to help them buy better food. Subsidise fruit and vegetables and real ingredients. Make simple healthy meals cheaper and slap tax on junk food, as they successfully did on sugary drinks. The savings to the NHS and increased productivity from a healthier workforce would amply repay the cost. It’s frankly immoral to let the nation’s children sleepwalk into an adulthood of health problems and shortened lives. The next generation deserves so much more.

5/19/2022,"The idea of the Pope’s O’Rangers playing in a Big Vase final seemed utterly absurd as recently as five years ago. Having just seen his team knocked out of the qualifiers by Progrès Niederkorn, the fourth best team in Luxembourg, the then-O’Rangers manager Pedro Caixinha was subsequently seen remonstrating with angry fans while standing in a bush, a state of affairs that correctly suggested his reign was doomed a month before the fitba season proper had even started. How things change. On Wednesday night in Seville, O’Rangers will line up against Eintracht Frankfurt for the final of this season’s competition, one in which they’ve already knocked out two much better Bundesliga teams. And in the sizzling heat of Andalusia, upwards of 150,000 Gers fans are seeking sanctuary in the shade of the local orange trees before what is arguably the biggest game in what some cynics view as the club’s proud nine-year history. But The Fiver has long been of the view that if it looks like O’Rangers, sounds like O’Rangers and plays like O’Rangers, then it’s definitely O’Rangers and there’s little to separate them and their opponents going into this decider. “A Scottish club getting to [Big Vase] final?” mused veteran keeper Allan McGregor. “It shouldn’t really happen, should it? Let’s be honest.” Speaking on the wireless from Seville, O’Rangers royalty and Scottish national treasure Ally McCoist could barely contain his giddiness, promising the bevvies would be on him should his former club win at the Ramón Sánchez-Pizjuán Stadium. “I am going to throw my wallet to the crowd if we win tonight,” he promised. “I am going to throw credit cards about. It will be deep joy.” If the scenes of carousing being beamed into Fiver Towers from Spain are anything to go by, Ally could be bankrupt by this time on Thursday. It is heartwarming to see then that, thus far, all who have travelled from Scotland are enjoying themselves while keeping tomfoolery to a bare minimum. With around 50,000 Frankfurt supporters also in Seville, not to mention the handful of Queen’s Celtic fans who still haven’t made it home from their final against Porto in 2003, the local constabulary are on high alert. “I know we have a lot travelling with us,” said O’Rangers manager Giovanni van Bronckhorst. “We have to enjoy the occasion, but make sure we are not causing any problems. Half the people will go home really happy and half will not, but we should respect the whole city and people working hard to accommodate us and not leave anything negative behind.” Anything, that is, apart from Coisty’s credit cards, which could end up behind several different bars.

Peel’s family said in a statement: “John/Dad was in a position to have access to many of the most celebrated people and events in the history of popular music. This is reflected in a wealth of souvenirs he collected. In going through the accumulation of 40 years of pop music moments, we decided that some of the most interesting items might find a home, with fans of his programme or of the artists whose music he played.” Among the other items up for auction in Live in Session: Property from the John Peel Archive are a handwritten letter signed by David Bowie, a 7in of Nirvana’s 1988 single Love Buzz/Big Cheese and the BBC Radio 1 DJ’s horn gramophone, which sat on his desk at the family home in Suffolk fondly known as Peel Acres. The Lennon/Ono pressing is estimated to sell for between £15,000 and £20,000. Katherine Schofield, director of Bonhams’ popular culture department, said: “John Peel had an incredible impact on the new music landscape. Without his passionate advocacy of emerging talent, generations of music lovers may never have heard the sounds of the Fall, the Undertones, Sex Pistols, and countless others. “This collection, offered directly by the family, comprises some of Peel’s most collectible and rare records, spanning decades in music – many of which are accompanied by letters from the artists or their management.” Peel died of a heart attack in 2004, aged 65. He was one of the longest-serving Radio 1 DJs, appearing on the station from 1967 until his death. He was known for his uncontainable and adventurous music tastes and for his particular patronage of artists including PJ Harvey, Captain Beefheart, Pulp and the White Stripes. Trademarks of his BBC Radio 1 show included the live Peel Sessions and the annual Festive Fifty countdown of Peel’s favourite songs of the year. In 1998, he was named an OBE for services to British music. He also ran a record label, Dandelion Records, from 1969 to 1972, was a regular presenter on Top of the Pops in the 1980s, and wrote a memoir, Margrave of the Marshes, which was completed by his wife, Sheila Ravenscroft, after Peel died while on holiday in Peru.

5/19/2022,"Boris Johnson’s row with the EU over Northern Ireland’s Brexit arrangements is “absolutely solvable” but only if the UK accepts that a border is inevitable, the former head of the World Trade Organization has said. But Pascal Lamy said the prime minister could only achieve a breakthrough if he stopped mixing “oil and vinegar” and throwing emotional Brexit politics on to what he said was essentially a technical problem. Lamy said he did not understand the UK’s strategy, which risked a trade war with the EU, but added that it was unlikely to come to this as the “cost-benefit ratio” was “ridiculous”. If matters did deteriorate and the EU retaliated with sanctions, the bloc would win as those with greatest capacity for trade generally did, Lamy said. His comments, in an interview with the Guardian, came after the British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, threatened new laws to allow the UK to change some of the Northern Ireland protocol. The UK government has come under pressure from the Democratic Unionist party and the Traditional Unionist Voice, both of whom campaigned on an anti-protocol ticket in the recent Northern Ireland assembly elections. Lamy, who has followed Brexit closely over the past seven years, and who is now president of the Paris Peace Forum, a French non-profit organisation, after leaving the WTO in 2013, said demands to remove the border in the Irish Sea completely would never deliver a breakthrough. “I don’t understand exactly what they [the UK] are after,” he said. “If it is no border it won’t work. You cannot leave the EU and not have a border. That’s just having your cake and eating it. “So there is a question mark as to what exactly is the problem on the UK side. If it is ‘we don’t want a border’ then it is like saying: ‘We don’t want Brexit.’ Then this is unsolvable.” Lamy continued: “The UK government has this capacity to mix problems and to cook a political soup. “These are oil and vinegar issues between emotion and technicalities. Emotion is extremely high because Boris Johnson keeps beating the drum to say Brexit is a great thing. He has to increase the sound of the drum to say Brexit is a great thing all the time.” If the UK admitted a border was the direct consequence of Brexit, then a solution could be found, Lamy said. There could be a dynamic solution for Northern Ireland, he suggested. This would involve a “thin border” with few checks on trade across the Irish Sea while the UK remained aligned to EU standards. This would become a “thick border” if the UK wanted to diverge from those standards, Lamy added. This solution would require equivalence in standards with the EU and has already been rejected by the UK as unacceptable because it would compromise the country’s control of its own laws. Lamy said this went to the core issue of borders between nations and always involve tradeoffs. “The UK are torn between their political position, which is they want to have the capacity to diverge [on standards], and the technical consequence of that, which is a thicker border,” he said. The only way to solve the issue was to “dial down the emotion” and “let the technicians find the solution that allows both sides to find a midway between a thick and a thin border”. Given the border between the UK and the EU was not negotiable, the UK’s best shot at a solution was to “play for time, as you can’t play with money”, Lamy said. Solutions included trusted trader schemes that would would “transport the border up the value chain” and light-touch checks at ports. “Customs officers only have a limited amount of time in the day. It’s about finding a compromise between ensuring control on one side and trade to flow on the other,” Lamy said. He played down the UK’s threat to legislate to “disapply” some of the protocol if the EU did not concede to Johnson’s demands, saying he found it difficult to believe the UK and the EU would end up in a trade war. “If there was one, the EU would win as generally the one that has the largest trade capacity prevails,” Lamy said. With war in the Ukraine and Sweden and Finland making the momentous decisions to join Nato, Brexit was an “irritant” to EU leaders, he added.",News/Politics,"UK must accept border on Irish Sea is inevitable, says ex-WTO chief",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/18/uk-has-to-accept-border-irish-sea-inevitable-ex-wto-chief-pascal-lamy-brexit-boris-johnson
5/19/2022,"Finland and Sweden have submitted their applications for Nato membership triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Seven people share their thoughts on what Nato membership would mean for them, and how they feel about the Russia-Ukraine war. I feel I speak for many Finns when I say we are choosing the lesser of two evils. I have never been a fan of Nato but Putin has left us no option. He trashed the trust and made it clear that Russia is not only callous and cruel, but its regime is also highly unpredictable in its irredentist adventures. Some Finns have always wanted to join Nato. I can understand that, but I think neutrality served us well over the years. Russia just made it impossible to carry on.One problem is that because these seismic shifts have been so fast, we’ve never had the time to properly discuss what our role or place in the alliance would be: should we follow the US interests as closely as possible, like Denmark? Or build closer ties with Estonia and [the other] Baltics? Or try to build on a similar peaceful mediator role as before? Mikael Viljanen, 45, teacher, Helsinki, Finland We should have joined Nato as early as the Baltic countries did. In Finland we are used to trusting what has been agreed – even someone’s spoken word is enough. The leaders of Russia have shown now very clearly that they act just the opposite. At the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine war I felt deeply desperate and even paralysed. I experienced similar things when I was a child when my father fought against Russians on the frontline as a medic in the war between the Soviet Union and Finland. In Finland there are a lot of people of Russian origin – most of them do not want war. I feel deep sorrow for the ordinary people in Ukraine and Russia who are suffering. Juhani Viherlahti, 80, chief executive and entrepreneur, Espoo, Finland It’s all happened too fast as if there was absolutely no other choice. I feel we’ve missed out the possibility of peace. Joining Nato seems very shortsighted from the point of a view of a humanist and pacifist. I feel our country will be less safe and Helsinki could become an easy target for Putin. Katja, 56, psychotherapist, Helsinki, Finland My preference is for Finland and Sweden to remain independent from Nato, have no US troops or other weapons as they are not needed or wanted. But with the Russia-Ukraine war it was time to apply to join. I don’t think highly of Nato or what it does. If Finland is allowed to become a member I think there should be no Nato base in the country. Finland has to state that it will remain as a defensive country within Nato, as we’re not into war like the UK, US and others. Russia has complained and made threats since Finland became independent. Sometimes we think Russia should shut up, have a sauna, a beer, and relax. Leif Väisänen, 42, property renovator, Oulu, Finland Sweden has been neutral for more than 200 years. I think it’s a mistake to break that neutrality; a Nato membership will not be good for us in the long run. It seems the decision is either out of fear of a Russian invasion, or out of spite because Russia told us not to. Either way, fear or spite is not a good enough reason to make such a major decision this quickly. I would not want to be responsible should one of the other Nato nations do something stupid. It would be scary to have such a close military relationship with a country such as Turkey. Maria, 22, works for a textile company, Gothenburg, Sweden I think that the decision has been taken far too rapidly and without real possibility of democratic influence from other political parties. Firstly, the social democrats do not want the Nato question to be a question under debate in the run-up to the election in September. Secondly, they have been successful during Covid to portray themselves as the party that acts appropriately in times of crisis and they want to continue doing so. Nevertheless, they are abandoning 200 years of neutrality which has served Sweden well. I feel like this is the last part of an ongoing abandonment of the Swedish folkhemmet in which a strong and alliance-free state took care of its citizens. I feel a longing for a society that is now being lost. I also think that there will be a price to pay for Nato protection. Statements by [Recep Tayyip] Erdoğan are already signalling what that might be. I think Russia has little interest in Sweden besides if we join Nato – not joining is probably more secure. Karolina Enquist Källgren, 30s, associate professor, Stockholm, Sweden As a Finn residing in Sweden with a Swedish spouse, we are both sad that Nato wasn’t buried simultaneously with the Warsaw pact. They are both products of a bygone era. EU should have developed a strong European military union already back then. Regrettably, it’s too late for that now. Neighbouring countries such as Iceland, Norway and Denmark have participated in a military alliance led by Washington – for what appears to be no visible benefit to any of them. Today’s situation is awful but we have no choice but to take the leap into Nato because some people in the west have allowed the dictatorship in Russia to flourish. Of course, Putin’s guilt is indisputable. Russia must be stopped.

5/19/2022,"Are we finally getting some good disability representation in fiction? Certainly, the publishing industry seems to have belatedly recognised the need to get disabled writers through the door. After a successful social media campaign, Amazon has recently introduced a “disability fiction” section. The Society of Authors now has a dedicated peer network for disabled and chronically ill writers. And in 2020, the Barbellion prize was set up to reward brilliant work by disabled authors. But does any of this mean that disabled people are finally seeing themselves and their experiences in the novels they pick up in Waterstones? It depends where you look. Children’s literature is definitely getting better at representation. Indeed, when I asked disabled friends and acquaintances to name their favourite disabled character, almost all of them highlighted books aimed at younger readers, like Elle McNicoll’s A Kind of Spark. Lizzie Huxley-Jones, who is disabled themself, says that through their work as a children’s author and sensitivity reader they are seeing signs of progress. “Even just in the last three years in the UK – probably five if I’m being extremely generous – I feel like there has been a big push around securing autistic talent, publishing autistic stories, which I think is great because, historically, autistic people really didn’t get to tell our own stories.” While Huxley-Jones acknowledges that there are still overlooked dynamics – characters with chronic pain, for example, or disabled kids of colour – they attribute the recent progress to a recognition that children deserve to see themselves reflected in the stories they read. There’s also the simple fact that a lot of kids’ books centre on a group of friends, rather than one protagonist, which creates space for more diversity. Huxley-Jones hasn’t seen the same commitment to representation in the adult literature sector, where they say disability is still seen as a niche topic. While there are some novels with disabled characters out there, a concerning number of them stick to damaging tropes – perpetuating stereotypes rather than portraying disabled people with the same depth and complexity as other characters. As Cat Mitchell, a lecturer in writing and publishing at the University of Derby, puts it, there’s either “a tragedy narrative where the character dies at the end, or a narrative where either the person miraculously recovers or it’s discovered that their disability or illness was fake all along”. Several of the people interviewed for this article pointed to Jojo Moyes’s Me Before You as the ultimate example of the problem: the main character becomes disabled and then – spoiler alert – kills himself. “Not only are these narratives not realistic,” Mitchell says, but “they’re never written as if there are disabled people in the audience. It’s that nondisabled gaze that they are writing for, which is really problematic.” She is equally disparaging of triumph-over-adversity narratives, in which a disabled person’s struggles in an ableist world are used to make a nondisabled audience feel lucky by comparison. These tired stereotypes are exactly what Victoria Scott, who co-led the campaign for the Amazon disability section, set out to tackle with her fiction. Her debut novel, Patience, drew on her relationship with her nonverbal sister to explore the complex ethical questions that will come with a future in which genetic conditions can be cured. “I wrote it from the family’s perspective,” she says, but she purposely gave the disabled character a distinct and idiosyncratic voice. “I feel like society pushes people like my sister into the shadows, and it doesn’t acknowledge them … so when I wrote Patience, I wanted her to be an awesome character. She’s funny. She’s a bit sweary. She’s a massive Take That fan. And she’s got all these different parts of her personality. She’s a really interesting, multifaceted human being.” Scott’s determination to portray the inherent value of disabled life is in stark contrast to all the stories in which disability is a byword for worthlessness. Books like Scott’s, which put disability front and centre, are important in an industry that undervalues these stories and sees them as niche rather than universal. Scott wanted to create the Amazon category to dispel this idea, and to encourage other authors to write stories that treat disability as interesting and worthy of artistic attention. Equally important, says Mitchell, is “incidental representation,” where a character “just happens to be disabled and it’s not really central to the plot”. This is almost unheard of in adult fiction, she says. The reasons for this lack of representation are varied, but Mitchell and Huxley-Jones point to the inaccessibility of publishing as an industry. Hours are long and, for authors, pay is often delayed. Much depends on making contacts at long and inaccessible conferences. And because publishers pay an advance for a book long before they make money from it, they are incentivised to stick to narratives and characters they already know will sell. So it probably shouldn’t be surprising that we see the same tropes again and again. Yet, the increasing diversity of children’s literature shows us that change is possible. If we can recognise that disabled kids deserve to see themselves represented in books, we must surely be able to recognise that disabled adults deserve the same. After all, disabled kids grow up. Hopefully, developments such as the new Amazon disability category and the Barbellion prize will encourage authors and publishers into the huge space disability representation could occupy. Diverse stories are important.

5/19/2022,"Towards the end of Brad Birch’s reimagining of Ibsen’s An Enemy of the People, farmer Patrick places a water bottle in the centre of the stage and invites fracking enthusiast and local MP Mick Powell to take a sip. He smirks and hesitates. It is a tense, briefly thrilling moment. While it is a tidy retelling of the source narrative, it is unfortunate that not much else in Birch’s adaptation nor in Joe Murphy’s staging comes close to being equally compelling. Birch relocates Ibsen’s original narrative to an unnamed town in present-day Mid Wales. It is an intriguing conceit: with Mick’s support, fracking company Westra are testing potential gas sites. Jobs and regeneration wealth are promised, until an explosion at the site begins to pollute the water table bringing Mick into conflict with Rhiannon, his sister and local GP. It is never clear whether A Hero of the People is a contemporary tale of political corruption set in a specific location, or if it is supposed to function as a parable. It aims to be both, perhaps, but such ambiguity is unpersuasive. Vaguely local while straining for universalism, it is undermined by banalities and illogical exposition that are at odds with its supposed reality. For example, if this is a contemporary world where the deletion of a corporate tweet is a significant plot point, it is never clear why the pages of a local newspaper appear to still be the only method of disseminating local information (or what the significance of this might mean in 2022, considering the perilous state of much local journalism). It is telling that the play is most persuasive in scenes that are wholly original, whereas much else falls between two dramatic stools.But if the play fails to convince, the performances often do. As Mick, Oliver Ryan is pleasingly slimy and, as his daughter Hannah, Mared Jarman offers a compelling emotional counterpoint. The excellent Suzanne Packer stirringly imbues Rhiannon with a convincing gravitas, even when her character has to resort to emotional histrionics, and Catrin Stewart as editor Elin Tate and Pal Aron as Patrick are great in two underwritten roles.

5/19/2022,"UK inflation is running at 9% in May, driven by sharp rises in the price of gas and electricity, food and transport costs. Among the groups hardest hit by the rising cost of living are pensioners, who are often on a fixed income and tend to spend more on home energy bills than other households. In April the state pension went up by 3.1%. The average energy bill of just under £2,000 is 20% of the £9,627 a year paid through the new state pension. Becky O’Connor, the head of pensions and savings at the website interactive investor, said: “It is asking the impossible to expect people on low, fixed incomes, including the UK’s more than 11 million pensioners, to shoulder such [price] increases. A high proportion of the UK’s 66 and over population are dependent on the state pension alone.” We heard from Guardian readers who are trying to keep up with rising costs. Suzanna, a retired teacher from London, has changed what she eats to help reduce her spending. “The cost of food means I buy less and have a basic diet,” she says. “I don’t [use the oven], because you worry about how much energy does the oven use. I normally eat very healthily. I’m going round looking at things that maybe I can just stick in the microwave because they’re cheaper. Even boiling vegetables, it takes quite a long time.” The 78-year-old lives in a block of flats for older people, but has had to cut down on socialising because of the cost, leaving her feeling isolated. “We’ve had the pandemic, and hardly anyone ever came out their room. I didn’t see anybody for weeks because a lot of elderly people are still very anxious. And now this. I moved just as the pandemic struck. My old friends are starting to say they’d like to come, but that means going out, eating, going to something.” Suzanna has a teacher’s and a state pension, but says they have not risen enough over the last decade to keep up with her costs. “Even though I had two pensions, it wasn’t a vast amount of money,” she says. She is worried about inflation getting worse. “Even if you can manage at the moment, the anxiety of older people will be all about next winter, or when everything goes up more.” In the last three months, Ken Taylor, 72, a retired salesperson from Sherburn in Elmet, North Yorkshire, has begun keeping a list of everything he spends. “I’ve been budgeting for every penny,” he says. “I’ve got a section for the house, I’ve got a section for food, the car, food for the dog, so I can see where the money’s going. And it does go, just about all of it, every month.” His monthly income from a state pension and a small work pension is £1,188, and his outgoings for essentials are £1,096, leaving £92 for any additional expenses. “It will not be long before I do not have enough to last the month,” he says. “I dread to think where I’ll be in six months’ time, because by then I’ll be chipping away into my savings. Because of energy costs, which we know already are going to ramp up in October, and food costs, which are going up all the time – and of course fuel prices are another burden.” Taylor uses his car for his own mobility and to visit his children, and is also part of a voluntary group taking people to hospital, so there are people in the community who depend on his ability to keep it on the road. “Because we’re in a rural area, people can’t afford taxis to go to hospital, but we take them [for free],” he says. “I’d like to see more support, not just for pensioners, for families as well. I don’t agree with this thing about people just getting by. It’s not good enough. People should be having a good life. We’re a very rich country.” Janet, 66, a retired teacher, lives in rural Wales with her husband, John, 65, a retired civil servant. The couple are trying to make energy savings where they can. “We have switched off everything electric except the lights, fridge, freezer, washing machine and TV,” she says. “I’ve gone back to using an old oil-fired Aga that stood in the corner for years because it heats the house and it dries my washing.” The high price of heating oil is a major concern. The couple used to be able to fill their oil tank for £600, but it now costs them £535 to fill just to halfway. “The tank will be empty by next winter,” she says. John has had four heart attacks and is now suffering from the aftermath of a Covid infection, meaning the house needs to be kept warm. “We’ve closed off the upstairs of the house,” says Janet. “We’ve converted our sitting room into a bedroom. So we live downstairs. I’ve put a curtain over the top of the stairs, which is very thick. And we just don’t use the upstairs of the house.” Janet was one of millions of women affected by a rise in the state pension age. She retired at 60 with what she thought would be enough savings to see them through, but says they are now “absolutely stacked up with loans and credit cards”. Janet does now receive the state pension, but because of that she no longer qualifies for a carer’s allowance, which used to bring in £68 a week. “We’re working people,” she says. “We’ve worked all our lives and we’ve enjoyed doing it, because we felt we were doing a good job, a beneficial job. I just feel so abandoned by the state.” Adrienne Ayres, 69, retired from mental health social work in 2014. “I now have hardly any savings,” she says. “When you retire, the things [money coming in] can be very small. So I do things like selling clothes on eBay. Things like that pick up a few quid, but if you can have an extra tenner in your hand that stops you taking it out of the bank.” Ayres lives alone and says she is very anxious about rising costs. “I shop economically but the cost of living has risen way beyond my pension,” she says. “Food particularly. I used to be able to keep it down to £50 [a week]. But now if I’m not careful I get up to £80. So I’ve seen £30 [extra] going on a food bill very easily in the last few months.” She has also seen her monthly energy costs rise by £26 a month over the last year. “I’m barely cooking,” she says. “And yet it’s gone up that amount, so what is going to happen when the heating goes on?” Though Ayres owns her own home, she is worried about the future. “I’m a lot better off than many women my age but the coming decade, the 70s, is a challenge,” she says. “When I first trained as a social worker I saw elderly people living in abject poverty, I saw horrid care homes smelling of urine. I imagined that by the time I retired we would have improved how we cared for older people. That’s the measure of a civilised society, isn’t it?”",News/Business,‘I feel abandoned by the state’: UK pensioners on the cost of living crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/18/uk-pensioners-cost-of-living-crisis
5/19/2022,"Thomas Tuchel has opened up on Andreas Christensen withdrawing from Chelsea’s FA Cup final defeat by Liverpool on the morning of the game, claiming it was not the first time the defender had pulled out of a match at short notice. Christensen, who is set to join Barcelona this summer, forced Tuchel into a late rethink for the final when he made himself unavailable despite not being injured. The Denmark centre-back was in line to start but he has complained of stomach issues before games in the past and it is unclear whether he will be involved when Chelsea host Leicester on Thursday and Watford on Sunday. “Andreas came in the morning of the match to inform me, speak to me,” Tuchel said. “He told me he was not ready to play the match, to start the match and be on the bench. He had his reasons. They stay private and confidential. It was not the first time as you can see over the last weeks that we had some of the same situations. “That’s why he did not play regularly over the last weeks. We thought we are in a good progression, development because he played a strong match before the final against Leeds. The conversation took place. We had to respect it. Of course. He has our support still but for tomorrow I am unsure. It was very short notice before the Cup final, not only before this match. Other matches the weeks before. No chance I have a prediction before tomorrow or the weekend.” It remains to be seen whether Christensen is given a send-off at Stamford Bridge.

5/19/2022,"The chief executive of Shell is facing an investor revolt over his £13.5m pay packet, as oil and gas firms battle growing calls for a windfall tax on their profits. The investment adviser Pirc has urged shareholders to vote against Ben van Beurden’s pay packet at next week’s annual general meeting, calling it “excessive”. The Dutchman picked up £6.3m last year, up from £5.2m a year earlier. The company has given him a 3.5% increase in salary to £1.42m and he has the opportunity to land a further £12.1m in cash and shares by hitting company targets. Pirc said the chief executive’s salary was in the top 25% of a peer comparator group “which raises concerns over the excessiveness of their pay”. It also called for “the fallacy of alignment with shareholders to be retired”. Companies typically argue that large share awards incentivise executives to increase the stock price for investors. Van Beurden, who relocated to London from The Hague this year, has seen the value of his stock in the company balloon from £14m a year ago to £23m as investors have piled into oil and gas stocks during the energy crisis. Reports of bumper profits and pay at oil companies have sparked calls led by the Labour party for a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas operators to pay to reduce household energy bills. Boris Johnson has said he believes a one-off levy would deter investment into the UK by energy companies. His Labour counterpart, Keir Starmer, on Wednesday urged the prime minister to “make up his mind” and said a U-turn on the tax was “inevitable”. Van Beurden has received more than £70m in pay and bonuses since taking the job in 2014. He suffered a shareholder revolt over his £8m pay packet in 2018. His pay has significantly diminished since the £17.8m he landed before Covid lockdowns hit oil stocks. Van Beurden was last year docked £132,283 – 10% of his base salary – after the firm recorded eight deaths. The fatalities included six workers at an engineering contractor killed when gunmen attacked a bus convoy en route to a gas project in Nigeria. The investor advisory service Glass Lewis said not reducing his payout by more “risks sending a mixed message to the executives as to the company’s overarching safety goal” but still suggested shareholders should vote in favour of Shell’s pay proposals. The company’s long-term plan to reduce its emissions will also be discussed at its annual meeting, which takes place in London on Tuesday. The Shell investor Royal London said it intended to abstain on a vote on the firm’s climate transition proposals. “There is not enough certainty in the plan that it aligns with the goals of the Paris agreement and the global necessary efforts to constraint temperature increases to below 1.5C,” Carlota Garcia-Manas, the head of engagement at Royal London Asset Management, said. The Dutch activist group Follow This wants the company’s policies to be more consistent with the Paris climate accord. Shell’s board has told investors to reject the group’s resolution that asks it to set more stringent climate goals. The Follow This founder, Mark van Baal, said: “We hope investors do not give in to the narrative from oil companies that the crisis created by the war in Ukraine overrides the climate crisis.” Shell declined to comment.",News/Business,Shell boss faces investor rebellion over £13.5m pay package,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/18/shell-boss-faces-investor-rebellion-over-pay-package
5/19/2022,"Ilearned photography through workshops and forums in Hanoi, Vietnam. This is where I fell in love with documentary-style photography. It had a creative freedom I couldn’t find in other forms. Feeling inspired, in the summer of 2010 I went to a documentary workshop in Siem Reap, Cambodia. Participants had seven days to come up with a project, and five days in I was the only one who didn’t have any pictures. My idea was to do something around culture, and while researching this, I came across a website called thepinkchoice.com, a travel guide for the LGBTQ+ community listing gay-friendly hotels and cities. At the time, I didn’t know much about homosexuality, but I wanted to learn and understand more and I decided to document the people who stayed at these hotels. When I returned to Vietnam, I learned more about the LGBTQ+ community in Hanoi, and thought about how they were portrayed in the media. Although homosexuality is legal and generally accepted in Vietnam today, there were, and still are, negative stereotypes in TV and film. Gay characters are either tragic or comic, nothing in between. In photography, it was no better. Pictures documenting LGBTQ+ stories hid faces or showed only small details of intimacy, such as holding hands. It made me feel like being gay was a taboo, and I felt these representations didn’t empower the LGBTQ+ community. The reality was different. My gay friends lived happily and were open about their sexuality. But wider society was only open to a degree. I found that I got negative reactions to pictures I took of gay couples being intimate, which really motivated me to continue with my project. I wanted to show gay relationships in a natural and beautiful way. By capturing couples in familiar, everyday activities, I hoped to open the eyes of Vietnamese society to the intimacy and love that these couples shared. I met Phan Thi Thuy Vy and Dang Thi Bich Bay, the couple in this picture, through some other people I had photographed for the project. They were university students, full of life and madly in love. Like a lot of the younger couples I met, they weren’t concerned with neighbourhood talk – they were just excited to have their photograph taken. I always spend time with the people I shoot to get to know them a little before taking their picture, and I met Phan and Dang two or three times for coffee before I went to their house, without my camera, to get a feel of their place and how they spent their time. You have two times when you can naturally capture people: the beginning of the day when they don’t care yet, and the end of the day when they’re most tired. On the day of the shoot, I only had the afternoon, as the two were busy with university much of the time and worked weekend mornings in a coffee shop. The girls were play-acting as soon as I got there – cooking, showering and talking with friends on the phone. I knew the frame I wanted, so I had to be patient. I sat behind the TV, somewhat hidden but able to capture them from different angles. Then, as the sunset lit the room, Dang lay down eating lychees, and Phan came and sat with her. Their tiredness had caught up with them, and as they gently comforted each other, my presence was barely felt: I knew I had the shot. This was the last picture I took that day, and the final of the whole series. I find the charismatic simplicity of their home powerful, and their young love and carefree nature, not knowing what the future holds, extremely comforting. Working on the Pink Choice changed me. The couples I photographed gave me strength to not care what other people think. My photos don’t provide all the answers, but I hope that they ignite a curiosity, a feeling that inspires me whenever I start a project – a curiosity to question and learn.

5/19/2022,"An NHS trust has been fined over £1.3m after it admitted breaking the law by failing to provide safe care in two cases where patients died after serious mistakes were made by hospital staff. The Shrewsbury and Telford trust pleaded guilty on Wednesday at Telford magistrates court to three criminal charges brought by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), the NHS care regulator in England. The charges related to the deaths at the Royal Shrewsbury hospital of 31-year-old Mohammed Ismael Zaman in October 2019 and Max Dingle, who was in his 80s when he died in May 2020. It was ordered to pay a fine of £800,000 over Zaman’s death and £533,334 over Dingle’s. It was also told to pay the CQC’s costs of £42,378. The CQC mounted the prosecution because both men had been exposed to avoidable harm as a result of serious safety failings at the hospital, in breach of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014, which are intended to guarantee safe, high-quality care. Zaman, a trainee pharmacist, died of severe blood loss while having kidney dialysis. His dialysis machine had set off a venous pressure alarm when his catheter became disconnected. However, the member of staff who reset the alarm did not check if the catheter was connected. Zaman lost three pints of blood in seven minutes, was found in a pool of blood and died, despite attempts to revive him. The CQC’s lawyer Ryan Donoghue told the court Dingle’s “head was trapped between the bed rails and mattress” after he was admitted with chronic lung disease. Although the alarm was immediately raised when he was found, and he was freed, he died from a cardiac arrest. Referring to Dingle’s death, Donoghue said: “The basis [of the trust’s guilty plea] is that the failures exposed him to a significant risk of avoidable harm.” The trust was heavily criticised in a damning review published in March into poor maternity care it provided for decades at both the Royal Shrewsbury and Telford hospitals. The inquiry, by Donna Ockenden, found that 201 babies and nine mothers could or would have survived if they had received better care. The police are looking into 600 cases linked to the scandal. Phil Dingle, the son of Max Dingle, said: “It is sad to lose a father at any stage in life, but more so in such tragic and preventable circumstances. “With many still unanswered questions, I find it incomprehensible that a hospital trust is allowed to ‘self-police’ a serious and unexpected incident which is highlighted as a known risk by the Health and Safety Executive. Furthermore, an independent Home Office coroner should be appointed in such circumstances to ensure transparency of process with the postmortem.” Peter Walsh, the chief executive of the patient safety charity Action against Medical Accidents, highlighted that the trust was previously prosecuted in 2016 by the HSE over unsafe care and patient deaths. “The police are reportedly looking at hundreds of maternity cases which may lead to prosecutions. One has to ask whether the system for regulating the trust and holding it to account for such serious and repeated failures is working. Fines are clearly not enough,” Walsh said.",News/Society,NHS trust fined £1.3m over deaths of two patients after staff mistakes,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/18/nhs-trust-pleads-guilty-over-death-of-two-patients-after-staff-mistakes-shrewsbury-telford

Invited to join in a training match with the under-8s, Morrison ambled around the field amiably while his side scored a goal with little assistance from the prime minister. Morrison then got more active by executing a successful tackle on the wing.

The club posted on Facebook that “the latest star of the election is OK and looking forward to being the star of the show at school tomorrow!” It said Luca had “showed plenty of determination and effort to stop the PM scoring at all costs”. Morrison quipped in the clubhouse: “Where’s Luca? Please tell me he hasn’t gone off to the hospital.” The prime minister also made light of the incident with a reference to his recent attempt at self-reinvention when he promised to be more empathic and recognised he could be a “bit of a bulldozer”. “I look forward to coming back on another occasion. I think that when that grandstand comes down, I hear it might need a bit of a bulldozer to knock it down, so I might be able to help with that,” he told the assembled parents and players.

On Tuesday, the Liberal MP Gavin Pearce announced a $3.5m grant for the Tasmanian soccer club to undertake a substantial redevelopment of the grounds including lighting and pitch upgrades, construction of a new grandstand, and refurbishment of existing clubroom and kitchen facilities. Pearce holds Braddon on a margin of 3.1%. The Devonport City Soccer Club received $385,000 in the community sport infrastructure grant program, which the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) found was used by the Morrison government to boost its standing in marginal seats ahead of the 2019 election. Last week, Guardian Australia revealed the two major parties had made $40m of commitments to clubs that already benefited from the “sports rorts” program. The Devonport club’s initial grant proposal had received a score of 77.5 which the ANAO found meant it did merit funding.",News/Australia news,‘Please tell me he hasn’t gone to hospital’: Morrison the bulldozer knocks over a child while playing soccer,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/18/please-tell-me-he-hasnt-gone-to-hospital-morrison-the-bulldozer-knocks-over-child-while-playing-soccer
5/19/2022,"I didn’t love reading at all when I was young. As a teacher, I loved it, and now as a reader, I love it. But I was put off the whole idea of words very early on. Some years ago, I was made to do a key stage 2 (seven to 11 years old) English test. I don’t even want to tell you how I did, but it wasn’t good. I find expressions such as “fronted adverbials” and “subordinate conjunctions” extraordinarily abstract and difficult to get my head around. But we’re stuck in the Michael Gove era, in which children are trained in analysing language in a way that seems to me to restrict and inhibit, rather than to encourage creativity. So I was glad to discover that someone has done some proper research on this part of Gove’s education reforms; UCL and University of York have found that this emphasis on grammar in primary school does not improve six- and seven-year-old children’s writing. When I was a primary school teacher in the 1970s, in a village called Wickhambreaux, just outside Canterbury, we were free of such burdens. I was able to concentrate on encouraging children to find their own voices. That is what literacy is for – to express your thoughts, to discover the music in language, the joy of reading, and all the interest, knowledge and understanding we can gain through that. It is not the analysis of a sentence – that comes later. As you read one story, they pick up a book by the same author or a similar book with a similar subject, and extend their reading on their own. And I extended their writing by saying to them: “Look, Roald Dahl was your age once. He sat down and wrote his first story. Why don’t we go and write our stories?” I would never make them sit down with a blank sheet of paper, and then say: “Do it”, which is what happens time and time again in tests up and down the country to this day. It’s an impossible task to set a child. You have to inspire them; you have to go out and trigger it somehow. We would go for long walks up to the nature reserve, look at herons standing in the reeds, and we would be quiet. Then we would go back and write down what we felt about what we had seen. Some children would be descriptive; most were very thoughtful. But each of them was beginning to find their voice as a writer. They weren’t cramped by anything I was trying to teach them. This is the opposite of how I was taught, at St Matthias primary school in London, which was very punishment-driven. There was fear in the classroom, and grammar and punctuation were part of that. It is now a wonderful school, where kindness and creativity go hand in hand. I came from quite a bookish family. I was read to every night by my mum, who was an actor. She was guided by the instinct that if she loved a poem or a story, she wanted to tell me that story, or read me that poem. So I was handed the love of stories by my mother, but then went off to primary school, where I learned that words were not for storytelling, or music or fun. They were about spelling and punctuation, and if you got things wrong, you were in trouble. I didn’t want to go into detention, but I did spend an awful lot of time there because I found the more red marks I got, the more I was scared. And when you’re scared, you don’t do things very well at all. I knew I was pretty good at telling lies, but I didn’t know I could be a storyteller until much later, when I was a teacher. On World Book Day this year, a pupil asked me: “Do you ever make mistakes?” Of course I make mistakes. When I’m working on my own books, I often slip into a slack way of saying things, which is too oral, if you like. I’m reminded about it fairly firmly by good editors, and that’s fine – it’s a way of improving what’s already there, and refining it. My spelling isn’t that great, either; I’m quite ashamed of that sometimes. My grandson can spell things better than me. But that’s OK. It’s just a side of me that needs improvement. At 78, I’ve got plenty of time left. I tell children to look at the manuscripts of writers far greater than I shall ever be, and the amount of crossings out that they do. Children are concerned about not getting it right, and that is part of the problem. But actually, it’s really good fun telling a story. I’ve been working on a new one this morning. I started the day thinking it was going to be one kind of a story. I started the first three or four sentences, which didn’t seem to go that well, so I crossed them out. That’s what you do – you judder and judder until you find the right tone for the story and a path seems to open up through the undergrowth in front of you, and you find a way to go. But it’s not going to be helped by a constant worry that the sentence you have just written is not correct. I grew up with people telling me: never, never start any sentence with “and”; I start huge numbers of sentences with “and”. I’m not just trying to get back at some English teacher I had when I was 10. While I can see how you could overdo it, sometimes there’s a really good reason for doing it. And sometimes there’s a very good reason for having a comma rather than a full stop. It’s a matter of judgment, and not just rules. I think today’s rules are a misunderstanding of language. Grammar, punctuation and spelling are guidelines about how we frame our language, and very important in terms of communication, for accurately reflecting what it is we wish to say and how to be understood. But they’re not supposed to tie us up in knots. It is important to keep our focus on every child becoming a reader, and having the experience of falling in love with Philip Pullman and Jane Austen and Shakespeare. It is not about teaching something that’s then got to be tested. If you do that, what will happen – and what has always happened in our system – is that those who succeed at that level are fine and go on their way towards university. And those who don’t succeed begin to feel that they’re failures and that language and books aren’t for them, because they’re not enjoyable, because they keep getting bad marks in tests. The problem with testing is that there are winners and losers and we have an education system that divides people very early on. More and more, what has been lacking in our primary schools is space in the curriculum for creativity, for exploring the potential of children in terms of the way they use language. I often get letters from teachers and children correcting the grammar in my books, and they are quite right. But people can be over-obsessed by it. If you look at some of our great writers and you start analysing sentences, the poetry is what counts, the sound, the meaning. The grammar is supposed to be what serves that. It’s not what you start out with in the first place.

5/19/2022,"Our energy system is crucial to two of the biggest issues facing the British public: the cost of living crisis and the climate and environment emergency. Yet we are leaving this sector to be inefficiently and exploitatively run by private companies. Electricity is generated by burning fossil fuels or by renewable technology such as wind turbines; then it is distributed along the national and regional grids, and finally sold to us by energy suppliers. In the UK, there is no public sector role in this: every part of the process is privatised. Right now, Britain needs to address three things to deal with the crises at hand: we need to transition to generating renewable energy, we need to make sure our national grid is ready for this change, and we need to reduce the prices charged by energy suppliers. The latter issue has become particularly acute since global gas prices spiked due to an uptick in economic activity after pandemic lockdowns ended, and supply restrictions by Russia. Smaller energy suppliers went bust as their wholesale costs exceeded the price cap – the maximum price that suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge households. In April this year, the price cap rules allowed private suppliers to increase bills by an average 54% , and further increases are certain later this year. The government has provided temporary rebates on energy bills and tax relief to customers. The customers of 29 failed energy suppliers have been rescued by transfer to other companies, at the expense of a £2bn surcharge on all energy consumers. Bulb, regarded as too big to fail, is being supported by the Treasury at a cost of £2.2bn. Thus all of the costs of the energy crisis are falling on to the public, either directly through their bills or indirectly through their taxes. None of these costs are borne by the owners of the private companies: quite the opposite. In the last six months, the value of shares in National Grid and Centrica have leapt 20% above the general trend – it’s a good energy crisis for their shareholders. In comparison, in France the system remains dominated by EDF, which is 85% owned by the French state. This has enabled the government to directly control prices by imposing a cap of 4% on EDF’s price rises at a cost of €10bn, which has been financed by halving the company’s profits. The private shareholders of EDF have seen the value of their shares fall 25% below the general trend of share prices. The lack of public sector energy companies also hinders the transition to renewable energy. International evidence shows that “state-owned utilities have a higher tendency to invest in renewables”, because public bodies can insist on the implementation of policy objectives, and that this investment encourages further private investment. In the UK, contracts for offshore wind generation, the biggest single opportunity for renewable generation, and the associated profits and employment opportunities, are all given to commercial companies – which include, paradoxically, large publicly owned European companies Ørsted (of Denmark) and Equinor (Norway). In Germany, where much of the energy sector is in the hands of regional and local government, the city of Munich has stopped trying to persuade reluctant private companies and has instead decided that the municipal utility company would make the investments needed “to produce so much green energy that the entire demand of the city can be met [by 2025]”. The private owners of the transmission and distribution grids provide continuing proof of the 200-year-old economic observation that “natural monopolies” are exploited for excessive gain in private hands, and so should be publicly owned. The National Grid alone extracted £1.4bn in dividends in each of the last two years. They even create further problems for the transition to renewable energy, which offers an opportunity for further extraction of monopoly profits, by making excessive charges for connections to the grid, delaying renewable projects by up to 10 years. A more effective approach would be to enable consumers to sign up to a publicly run energy supplier, by properly nationalising Bulb; to bring the grid into public hands so we can upgrade the system to deal with renewable energy, and stop the extraction of billions in dividends; to create the capacity for more government- and community-owned renewable energy generation; and to open energy policy to public participation by creating regional energy agencies. British people are shouldering the burden of the energy and climate emergencies while private companies profit. The case for public ownership is now being made on a daily basis by the failures of our current system. As we see in Europe, there are much better, public, alternatives.

5/19/2022,"Paul Verhoeven’s Dirty-Harry-Frankenstein’s-monster goes clanking and wheezing out into the Detroit streets once more, with his humungous exo-skeleton, thigh-mounted handgun case, killer-marionette walk and the balletically defined 45-degree head-swivels that precede a change in direction. This sci-fi action satire from 1987, wittily scripted by Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner, is now rereleased in its original director’s cut, with the gruesome violence and its attendant black-comic queasiness restored. But the gore was never, for me, entirely the point. RoboCop looks more than ever like Verhoeven’s masterpiece, a classic of 80s Hollywood and apart from everything else a brilliant commentary on the city of Detroit; hi-tech RoboCop is a harbinger of the decline of the automotive industry and the ruin-porn wasteland to come. And America’s automated “Star Wars” defence system of the Reagan age comes into discussion: in a throwaway aside, the film imagines it accidentally zapping Planet Earth, killing two former presidents as it does so. Murphy (Peter Weller) is a cop in Detroit who is assigned to a new partner: Lewis (Nancy Allen). But Murphy is butchered and left for dead by a drug gang led by ruthless mobster Clarence (Kurtwood Smith), who is laundering his coke profits through a creepy corporation led by chilling CEO Mr Jones (Ronny Cox). Jones happens to be developing “RoboCop” technology for the city’s police department: a cyborg officer which will be cheaper to run and impossible to kill, but which needs a cop’s body. Poor Murphy is chosen as the first bionic officer. And so the terrible beauty of RoboCop is born. When Murphy is in his comatose state, and then operated on by the tech boffins so that he can be reborn in robo-evolutionary form, there are some great point-of-view scenes as the white coated people peer callously down into this face. Then, of course, there are Murphy’s agonised memories of his own near-death, and of his wife and child, which the scientists have not been able to erase. We get some outrageous 80s-style action explosions and people perpetually getting thrown through plate-glass windows (the fake sugar-glass was a novelty that action directors hadn’t yet got used to) but there are also some great touches: the ramp that leads from the station-house out into the street is so steep that the bodywork of every squad car bashes sparks out of the concrete on their way up. The film is full of set pieces which have become classics: perhaps especially the boardroom scene at the very beginning, in which an early, quasi-quadruped version of RoboCop is demonstrated, and a luckless executive has to pretend he’s the surrendering robber who has only to throw down his weapon in front of the armed automaton to be peacefully arrested. The prototype doesn’t work out. There are droll clips from the TV news and ads for toys like the board game Nukem (a genuinely disturbing moment). RoboCop was obviously inspired by that other 80s classic, The Terminator – but The Terminator didn’t have this sophisticated, subversive element. The thrillingly impassive RoboCop still creates a frisson.  Robocop is released on 20 May in cinemas.",Arts/Film,"RoboCop review – thrilling, subversive 80s masterpiece from Paul Verhoeven",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/18/robocop-review-thrilling-subversive-80s-masterpiece-from-paul-verhoeven
5/19/2022,"Ihave never forgiven myself for attending the 1991 FA Cup final. Tottenham Hotspur versus Nottingham Forest. I had broken my leg very badly playing football a year earlier, and a blazer-wearer I knew at the Football Association had kindly sent me a ticket to cheer me up. I am a fan of neither Spurs nor Forest but, having never been to an FA Cup final, I was excited to be there. Well, I was excited until the moment I took my seat, whereupon my feelings turned to something more like guilt or shame. I was sitting between an ardent Forest fan and an ardent Spurs fan. Both were telling me of the lengths to which they had gone to score their tickets – and how many of their fellow fans were missing out. I felt terrible. As a neutral, I had no business being there. Football is no place for neutrals. If my team ever got to a major final, I would be livid to have to share the experience with someone who didn’t care either way about the result. I was deeply uncomfortable about being that someone. Spurs won 2-1; it felt like being at the wedding celebration of strangers or, in Forest’s case, the funeral of someone I didn’t know. On Wednesday night, 43,883 people will watch Glasgow Rangers and Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League final at Seville’s Ramón Sánchez-Pizjuán stadium. Only 19,000 of them have been allocated their tickets as supporters of the two teams. The other 24,883 tickets have gone to corporate guests and neutrals associated with various other clubs. Those 24,883 people need to take a long look at themselves. If they’re Rangers or Frankfurt fans who managed to wangle a seat from somewhere, fair enough. But the rest of them won’t be getting into footballing heaven, at least if I’m manning the pearly gates. The neutral fan or, even worse, the corporately entertained, there-for-a-night-out non-fan has been killing football for a good while now. The further your team goes in tournaments and cup competitions, the worse it gets. Working at the 2006 World Cup final in Berlin, I shared a coach from the park-and-ride at the Olympic stadium with a bus full of Samsung executives. They were all in suits, accessorised with lanyards – their golden tickets into suites wherein they would find huge tables groaning under the weight of mountains of fine food and drink. Outside the ground, I bumped into a guy I had met filming on a gas rig in the North Sea a couple of years earlier. The thing was, I remembered him telling me that day he wasn’t into football at all. I asked him what he was doing there. He told me his son’s girlfriend’s dad had been given some tickets; he was high up at McDonald’s, you see. In the stadium, proper fans of France and Italy were jammed into shamefully small areas behind each goal. It all felt terribly wrong. It was just as wrong – worse, actually – when I next went to a World Cup final: France versus Croatia in Moscow in 2018. This time, having Croatian heritage, I had a dog in the fight. I was there as a fan, and a fervent one at that. But next to me I had a sharply dressed middle-aged bloke who had plainly never been to a football match before. His lanyard told me he was Mexican. He celebrated goals for both sides with equal enthusiasm. He did so by standing up and dad-dancing while taking selfies. On the final whistle he celebrated France’s victory in the same way, if a little more vigorously. I glowered darkly, murderously, at him. Honestly, I would have been less offended by a jubilant Frenchman dancing triumphantly in front of me, playing an accordion and blowing Gauloises smoke in my face.
