4/7/2022,"Music writing has come a long way since the days of the inkies – the papers that would leave marks on their readers’ fingers – when a handful of male gatekeepers dictated the tastes of Britain’s music-loving teens. While female writers were occasionally admitted to this hallowed club, they were the exception rather than the rule. Since then, the music press has been at once democratised and straitened by the advent of free content. Previously marginalised voices are now being heard, even if the rates of pay are largely paltry. This Woman’s Work, an anthology of 16 essays by female writers compiled and edited by Sonic Youth’s Kim Gordon and the critic Sinéad Gleeson, is a piquant reminder of the talent, musical and literary, that has always been under editors’ noses, if only they cared to look. Billed as a “challenge [to] the historic narrative of music and music writing being written by men, for men”, the contributions cross genres, decades and continents, and are less about casting judgment on artists and their work than the process of discovery and the ways music can influence and enrich lives. The best of these pieces alight on the intersection of music and identity, and how politics and personal relationships are often intertwined with our listening. The American novelist Leslie Jamison’s Double-Digit Jukebox: An Essay in Eight Mixes is built around mixtapes and reveals how the author spent her formative years experiencing music through the preferences of the men in her life, from her older brother to friends and partners. For her, music was bound up with male approval, though this changes as she forges a life and identity of her own. As a single mother locked down with her daughter in the early months of the pandemic, she listens to old songs with fresh ears and finds them transformed. The author Fatima Bhutto, niece of the former Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto, reveals her childhood homesickness for a land she had never visited. This longing was passed down from her father, the politician Murtaza Bhutto, who, exiled from Pakistan and living in Syria, was forever telling his daughter that they would go back soon. He would play Otis Redding’s wistful (Sittin’ on) the Dock of the Bay, about a man far from home and Ho Jamalo, a Sindhi folk song played at weddings and parties. Music, she recalls, “carried us over the swells and tides of loneliness”. In the same essay, Bhutto also examines music as a means of resistance: Faiz Ahmad Faiz, Noor Jehan and Fela Kuti are among the artists to have stood up to oppressive regimes. “Tyrants fear music,” she observes, “because no matter their force and their power, they will never, not ever, be able to control what is beautiful.” Grief, whether for the dead or for the past, is a recurring theme, with music simultaneously offering comfort and re-opening old wounds. The London-based writer and broadcaster Zakia Sewell unearths cassette recordings of her mother, since devastated by mental illness, as a young woman singing in an acid jazz band. “She sounds happy,” Sewell reflects, “but there’s something telling in her vibrato, in the way it swells and quakes. My mother: a ghost, immortalised on tape.” Author Maggie Nelson’s vivid and heartfelt My Brilliant Friend recalls her childhood friendship with the Mexican-American singer Lhasa de Sela, stalwart of the all-female music festival Lilith Fair. Nelson had long ago lost contact with “my first and only truly bohemian friend” when she learned, in 2010, that she had died from breast cancer. Her essay is a visceral account of female adolescence and the ebb and flow of friendship as well as a moving epitaph for a complex, charismatic and sometimes maddening artist. Elsewhere, Jenn Pelly writes on Lucinda Williams’s Fruits of my Labor, describing it as “a requiem, a road song, an escape hatch, a poem”; Juliana Huxtable composes a febrile, if occasionally impenetrable, “praise poem” for Linda Sharrock, leading light of 1960s avant-garde jazz; Margo Jefferson looks at the life of Ella Fitzgerald and the multiple ways she was cruelly judged; Rachel Kushner traces the early career of Wanda Jackson before she found sobriety and God; andYiyun Litells of her relationship with Auld Lang Syne, which for her is best sung in July. Gleeson’s own essay pays tribute to the composer Wendy Carlos, the criminally overlooked brain behind The Shining soundtrack and more; while Kim Gordon has a conversation with the Japanese artist Yoshimi P-We, drummer in the Boredoms, about the purity of self-expression. If this all sounds a little serious, let me point you towards the Irish novelist Anne Enright whose Fan Girl finds her reflecting on the “beautiful disaster” that unfolded one day in New York when she met the artist and musician Laurie Anderson. Enright’s brain suddenly seemed to disengage from her mouth, rendering her incapable of saying anything other than “a single gloop of word-sentence-blurt”, which she renders as “fiffloopidiggllyblop”. She may have failed to form coherent sentences in Anderson’s presence, but she makes up for it in a lively and entertaining piece that paints the artist as a trailblazer, mischief-maker, kindred spirit and personal hero whose haircut Enright flagrantly copied. As the title suggests, the author makes no bones about being a “fan girl”, a pejorative term invariably used to separate serious male musical appreciation from music-loving girls supposedly driven by idolatry. Enright notes how she has strived to avoid what she calls “the music conversation, the one where people gather into tribes, swap favourites, judge, include, exclude, bond, claim status or coolness or an identity because of their choices. Music undoes me. It does not tell me who I am.” Judging by the other essays in this book – the title of which is taken from the Kate Bush song – you sense that Enright is not alone in rejecting musical tribalism and perceptions of what might be cool or otherwise. What binds these writers is their emotional connection to music, and their experience of songs as a portal to memories – whether painful or joyful – and a broader understanding of the world. This Woman’s Work is a collection of music writing, but in the loosest possible sense. Here, music is the soil in which all manner of stories take seed and bloom.

4/7/2022,"His name was Surtees Forster and he is pictured with his bucket directly in front of what was by any standards a sensational Roman discovery. That was in 1907. Nine years later he was dead, killed on the western front at the Battle of Flers-Courcelette. The poignant story of Forster and other “forgotten” labourers is to be told by English Heritage in a new exhibition at Corbridge Roman town on Hadrian’s Wall in Northumberland. Much is known about the Edwardian-era excavations of the site but until now little has been known about the boys and men who did the punishing physical work. The curator Frances McIntosh said she had always been struck by the people in the grainy black and white photographs who moved the tonnes and tonnes of earth to allow the excavations to happen. “I’ve always wanted to know their names,” she said. “These are men forgotten about and overlooked because they were the working men, they were in unstable, short-term contracts. They were labourers, agricultural workers, brickies … but the excavations could not have been done without these guys.” McIntosh has been sending copies of photographs to parish councils, contacting Facebook groups and using local newspapers to help find the names of the people in the photographs. So far she has managed to name 11 men and make contact with the families of three of them. The photographs have been colourised and will go on display – outside in the ruins themselves – in the hope more names can be found. “You do look back at black and white photographs and forget that things were in colour, the same as you forget there was colour in the Roman world,” said McIntosh. “You come to a Roman site and see yellow, or grey, or brown stone but actually the buildings would have been much brighter. You look at a black and white photograph from Edwardian times; that’s not what life was like, it was in colour.” Forster was one of the men identified. In the photograph he looks tiny in front of one of the most sensational finds – a stone lion attacking a goat, today known as the Corbridge Lion. Forster was just out of school, and around him were the working men who helped find it. The sense of achievement is obvious. “We know from the memoirs of one of the supervisors that the men were really proud of the work they did. When they first came they just thought of it as another job but that changed. They were men who worked in the brick factory, they were miners, they were gardeners, they became really proud of what they were doing,” McIntosh said. The men were involved in excavations uncovering objects that now make up one of the most important Roman collections in Britain. Corbridge began as a Roman military fort and evolved into a civilian settlement, which was the most northerly town in the Roman empire. Another striking photograph shows a boy cheerfully holding about six baskets. “It is such a great image,” said McIntosh. “I really think someone must know who he is, surely. I’m desperate for someone to be able to recognise him.”  Extraordinary Exploration: The Edwardian discovery of Coria is at Corbridge Roman town on Hadrian’s Wall.",News/UK news,English Heritage brings to life Corbridge Roman town’s lost Edwardian navvies,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/07/english-heritage-corbridge-roman-town-edwardian-navvies-hadrians-wall
4/7/2022,"Here is a celebratory documentary that takes for granted throughout that its audience is already hugely invested in its subject: the American TV chef and larger-than-life personality Julia Child. She is sufficiently legendary in the United States to have rated a biopic impersonation by Meryl Streep in the 2009 film Julie & Julia and also by Britain’s Sarah Lancashire in the recent HBO TV series Julia (alongside an otherwise largely American cast). Added to which, Dan Aykroyd once did a Julia Child sketch on Saturday Night Live and David Cross in the TV comedy Arrested Development did a whooping Julia Child voice when he dressed up as a Mrs Doubtfire nanny. As for this documentary, it’s a professionally made film with reasonable things to say about the birth of TV celebrity chef culture, challenging male dominance in the professional kitchen and Child’s role in promoting the pre-eminence of French cuisine among America’s emerging food-literate middle classes. But just as with that Meryl Streep movie, I found myself restless at the parochiality of this American icon, although the film does briefly ponder the French public’s lack of interest in her. So why exactly should anyone outside the US care about Child? Do we expect American audiences to be fascinated by documentaries about Fanny Cradock? As far as UK audiences are concerned … well, why not a documentary about a Canadian TV chef? Or a Bulgarian TV chef? Or a Japanese TV chef? Of course, the American children’s TV presenter Fred Rogers – glimpsed here – was also not much known in the UK, and the Tom Hanks film from 2019 about him, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood went over well. But that had a story to tell that reached out beyond the fanbase. And without that initial fanbase buy-in, Julia feels like a redundant tribute, with something very indulgent about the “foodie” rhapsodising.  Julia is released on 8 April in cinemas.",Arts/Film,Julia review – larger-than-life US cookery queen offers self-indulgent rhapsodising,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/07/julia-review-documentary-cookery-queen
4/7/2022,"Health-related human rights are under severe threat across the globe with devastating consequences for the public and healthcare professionals, a new report from the British Medical Association warned. The study, which examines the links between human rights and healthcare, identifies a “toxic combination” of emerging issues that have undermined human rights standards, putting renewed stress and pressure on populations around the world. BMA researchers say climate change, disinformation, neoliberalism, populism and socioeconomic inequalities are threatening “the vulnerable, the foreign, the marginal, the displaced, the ‘other’.” “This is a really critical moment to think through whether we’re serious about equalities in healthcare and basic universal provision,” said Dr Julian Shearer, one of the authors of the report. “We’ve got rising costs of healthcare, rising needs of healthcare and real challenges about how health goods can be distributed around the world. Globally, we’re at a turning point.” Inequalities were brought into sharp focus by the pandemic with the more powerful, wealthy countries given greater access to vaccines and personal protective equipment, the BMA said. Researchers found global cooperation had a direct impact on health outcomes, with resource-poor countries more exposed to Covid infections. Social media and other new technologies allowed governments to deliver public health messaging around the pandemic, including monitoring and interventions such as test and trace, but it also gave rise to the spread of health misinformation and increased state surveillance encroaching on the privacy of its citizens. This misinformation “undermines and undercuts” trust in the health authorities and medical opinion, Shearer said. “Populist politicians of a particular ilk have shown themselves adept at channelling their [citizens’] fears for short-term political advantage. The potential effects of these populist appeals on health-seeking behaviour can be extremely damaging,” Shearer said in the report, pointing to the example of Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro’s public discourse on Covid, who called the virus a “little flu”, which should be faced “like a man, not a boy”. Conflict has also had an adverse effect on global human rights and health. The protection of medical staff and facilities during conflict are of particular concern, with hospitals and medics targeted, as seen most recently in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Medical professionals and facilities should be sacrosanct, yet we see them deliberately and systematically attacked,” Shearer said. “We need to be moving to a time of restraint and respect for international humanitarian law.” Populations who have been displaced and sought asylum in neighbouring countries or farther afield are at greater risk of poor mental and physical health, and face significant challenges accessing healthcare. The report sets out the effects forced displacement of the Roma population have had on living standards and healthcare. It shows that one in three Roma are living in housing without running water and that Roma women are 4.5 times more likely to have a low birth-weight baby than a non-Roma woman, with their babies 2.8 times more likely to be born prematurely. Research also highlights the plight of the 600,000 Myanmar Rohingyas trapped in the country, confined to camps with inadequate food, healthcare and education, and routinely subjected to state violence. Those who have fled over the border to refugee camps in Bangladesh have limited access to healthcare, and inadequate resources to support the hundreds of thousands of people living there. Climate change and its links to more prevalent diseases and virus strains, as well as the transfer of infections on migration routes, was also found to be a major contributing factor to human rights imbalances between countries. Shearer says the transfer of viruses from non-human to human hosts, as seen during the pandemic, will “continue to be a feature of climate change”. The BMA makes urgent recommendations to policymakers, including the removal of barriers for migrants to access healthcare systems and greater support from wealthier countries to displaced and migrant populations. Clear recording of human rights violations during war, with a specific list of those that relate to health and healthcare were also urged, with health professionals calling for a strengthening of the international criminal court.",News/Global development,‘Toxic combination’ of issues threaten world’s health and human rights – BMA,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/07/toxic-combination-of-issues-threaten-worlds-health-and-human-rights-bma
4/7/2022,"I have been stuck in administrative limbo after an NHS test centre recorded my date of birth incorrectly following a positive Covid test in January. This has prevented me from getting a recovery pass. Test and trace has amended the typo but NHS Digital says that unless the date of birth was entered correctly on the date of the test, a recovery pass cannot be issued. As a result, I will be subject to stringent restrictions when I travel to Italy imminently. The Italian authorities have cancelled my vaccination pass because, according to the UK records, I have not recovered from my infection and I will therefore not be allowed to access public spaces. A Covid pass is vital to live as a free citizen and it is being denied to me because of a very minor typo.FC, Erith, Kent Given how many typos must occur at vaccine and test centres, it’s frightening to see that victims are effectively cancelled, and the authorities seemingly powerless to reinstate them. I reported a similar plight in January when another traveller to Italy was shut out of public life because her Covid pass had not been updated. In your case an 8 was confused with an 0 on your birth date. The email trail over the weeks you spent trying to resolve the problem shows you being batted between test and trace, 119 and NHS Digital, none of which seemed to have a clue how to proceed. The issue seems to be the many layers of technology at play within the NHS to match data from the various sectors. The test and trace database is only one link in the chain, and any amendments to that do not automatically flow across the other systems. NHS Digital told you it was working with “system architects” to learn how it could eliminate the typo across the organisation and enable a pass to be issued. The pioneering tone makes you wonder how past errors have been addressed. The eureka moment was achieved a couple of days after I waded in, although NHS Digital says it would have got there without press involvement.

4/7/2022,"Two years ago, during the first Covid lockdown, Boris Johnson came face to face with a reality which until that moment he had seemed reluctant to acknowledge: the unwelcome truth that he was not the all-powerful prime minister of the whole UK. Because health policy is a devolved matter, on Covid he was prime minister of England alone. To be an effective leader, therefore, he would have to go against his instincts and cooperate. Predictably, Johnson proved to be not very good at cooperating, and as a result effectiveness suffered. The imposition and then the easing of Covid restrictions around the UK became ever-more confused and politically driven. A global health problem became entangled with Johnson’s denialism, with the narcissism of small differences between the governments, and with his increasingly chaotic management of the Tory party at Westminster. In short, Johnson himself became part of the problem of fighting Covid. Two years on, we are again witnessing something similar. This time, the challenge to good governance and effective statecraft is playing out on the European stage, not the domestic one. Before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Brexit had allowed Johnson to promote a foreign policy that indulged his instincts as a British prime minister of the old school as he imagined it, strutting his verbose stuff – or at least as much as international Covid restrictions would permit – as the leader of what he portrays as a newly restored and independent global power. But war in Europe has challenged that illusion head on. In the task of confronting Russian aggression and rebuilding a democratic Ukraine, the route to effectiveness also requires clear-headed cooperation and alliance-building. That’s not easy among so many nations with different interests and histories. But it means that it is more important than usual to build trust between European nations for the long term. Yet in Johnson Britain has a leader who is ill-suited to that overridingly necessary cooperative task. He is, to put it mildly, an unreliable ally. If one moment embodied this problem in visual terms it was that footage of a seemingly isolated Johnson during the official photo sessions at the Nato summit in Brussels on 24 March. For a few embarrassing moments he is apparently standing on his own, looking into the middle distance for someone to talk to among the assembling western leaders who greet one another with handshakes and smiles. Johnson’s embarrassment was only brief and should not be overstated, but the image spoke to larger realities – to the self-inflicted isolation of Britain on the world stage after Brexit, and to a level of undoubted suspicion towards Johnson among foreign governments. This is not to imply that Johnson or Britain have played an unimportant role in the Ukraine conflict so far, let alone a reprehensible one. Britain’s military support for Ukraine before and after the invasion has been weighty, important and ongoing. London is also said to be playing a significant role in pressing others to take war crimes cases to the international criminal court. And Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has repeatedly and publicly praised the UK’s and Johnson’s contributions. Nevertheless the picture is mixed. Britain was slow to impose strong sanctions, on which the pace has mostly been made by the US, which imposed further measures against Russian banks and officials on Wednesday, and by the EU, which this week signalled a ban on Russian coal and ships that may become a complete embargo on Russian fossil fuel products. Britain also continues to be a very deliberate laggard on refugees, imposing visa conditions of a complexity and severity unmatched by any other European country. Nor has Britain matched its anti-Russian rhetoric with evidence of the kind of serious long-term strategic resets on which the EU and Germany have embarked. Johnson is expected to say important things on energy on Thursday, but there is no evidence that he is driving the international effort. That is hardly surprising, since most of the key decisions on sanctions are being made by Washington and Brussels. Britain has not got a seat at those tables. This is in part the result of Brexit and in part a reflection on Johnson’s own character. In truth the two cannot be separated. Just as Johnson eventually realised two years ago that he could not make Covid policy for the whole of the UK, so today he is now almost certainly aware that Brexit is not the success that he claimed it would be. The government’s benefits of Brexit document, published in January, embodies this absurdity in more than 100 glossy pages, full of inflated claims and pie-in-the-sky speculations. By indulging these nonsenses, Johnson leaves the door open for the Conservative right to drive through a deregulatory economic agenda that will simply make things worse. But he also weakens Britain’s ability to play its part alongside those who should be its allies. The evidence of Brexit’s damage is in plain sight. This is particularly true in the UK economy, where serious labour shortages in low-skill sectors are now running into the rising cost of food caused by Covid, higher fuel prices and Ukraine-related shortages. Growth forecasts have been revised downwards, supply chains are under growing pressure, and even Rishi Sunak admitted last week that Britain’s poor trading performance might in part be the result of Brexit. Although Britain’s cost-of-living crisis cannot be entirely laid at Brexit’s door, it is indisputable that it is a significant part of the problem and, moreover, that there is no end in sight of the difficulties it is causing. The same is true of the problems over Britain’s borders, control of which was supposedly the great prize of Brexit. It seems barely to have dawned on Johnson that secure borders are only secure if there are effective controls on both sides and that this requires cooperation, especially with Ireland and France. Instead, both are treated almost with indifference. If Britain reneges on the Northern Ireland protocol or fails to implement it while insisting that Russia must respect and uphold international law, the chorus of contempt will stretch from the Atlantic to the Urals and it will be fully deserved. The tragedy, at a time when the whole of Europe has to pull together to protect its values and its freedoms against Russia, is that Britain under Johnson is, at best, failing to play the important role in this alliance for which its size and resources equip it. At worst, by continuing to play Brexit games under a leader for whom others have so little respect or trust, it may even be undermining an alliance on which, in the end, we will all depend.

4/7/2022,"Iwent for a pint with a couple of friends in a nice country pub near Lichfield. It was all rather peaceful until a posse of half a dozen or so local rascals made their entrance. They were all different versions of each other. Their haircuts were short, but just long enough to merit the application of product. Their T-shirts and trousers were all extremely tight. I hope there was an elasticated element to those jeans or what was left of their journey through puberty might be bumpy. If they were 18, I’m a Dutchman. As they lined up along the bar to buy their individual pints of lager, another aspect of their garb became apparent: strung across their skinny bodies, every one of them had a handbag – well, a man-bag or boy-bag, I suppose we have to call it. This accessorising rather took the edge off any menace they had about them and, being in a leafy part of Staffordshire, there wasn’t a lot of menace to them in the first place. They looked so sweet, their cockiness dissipating a little as they got nervous about being served. I prayed they would; I couldn’t have borne to watch them file away disappointed, handbags and all. As it was, they took their lagers over to a big table around which they sat and talked about football, swearing quite a lot. Bless them. I asked some youths of my acquaintance what the hand/man/boy-bags were all about. Apparently, they’re part of the uniform of the roadman. No, me neither. The Collins English Dictionary says the roadman is “a man who spends a lot of time on the streets in a group, and who may be involved in selling drugs”. Drugs!?

4/7/2022,"A sensuous depiction of Pablo Picasso’s muse and lover as a multi-limbed sea creature, completed during the most prolific year of the artist’s life, is to appear at auction for the first time. Femme nue couchée (Naked woman reclining) is expected to sell for more than $60m next month, a reflection of the desirability among collectors of Picasso’s images of Marie-Thérèse Walter. “Picasso’s portraits of his golden muse Marie-Thérèse are undeniable hallmarks of 20th century art,” said Brooke Lampley, chair and head of global fine art sales at Sotheby’s, which is selling the painting. Femme nue couchée was “a deeply lyrical ode to the artist’s unbound desire for Marie-Thérèse; with her fin-like, endlessly pliable limbs, the portrait continues to enchant as it perfectly captures Picasso’s muse as the ultimate expression of his genius”. Picasso’s relationship with Walter – considered one of the great love affairs of the 20th century – was for many years a closely guarded secret. At the age of 45 and unhappily married, the artist fell for the 17-year-old Walter when he noticed her through the window of Galeries Lafayette in Paris in 1927. “I’m sure we shall do great things together. I’m Picasso,” he told the teenager, who had no idea who he was. She inspired paintings, drawings and sculptures, some of which are considered the greatest works from Picasso’s eight-decade-long career. An exhibition at Tate Modern four years ago was devoted to Picasso’s output in 1932, in particular his intense portraits of Walter. “There were many notable years in the long, dramatic career of Pablo Picasso, but 1932 stands out as particularly momentous,” said Julian Dawes, Sotheby’s co-head of modern art in New York. “In this ‘year of wonders’, Picasso produced the most sensuous depictions of his great muse and lover Marie-Thérèse Walter, who would inspire some of the artist’s most iconic images.” In Femme nue couchée, Walter is depicted with the sensuous limbs of a sea-creature. She was an enthusiastic and proficient swimmer, whose grace in the water was an enduring fascination for Picasso, who never learned to swim. The lovers had enjoyed trysts by the sea in the summer of 1928, when Picasso secretly installed Walter in a holiday camp close to where the artist, his then wife, Olga Khokhlova, a Russian-Ukrainian dancer, and their son Paulo were staying.
