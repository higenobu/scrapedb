2/14/2022,"Could the UK’s most powerful police officer be brought in from outside the force? Or might Priti Patel look even farther afield – to Australia, or even the United States – instead of recruiting from within Scotland Yard? Reports this weekend claimed that the unexpected resignation of Cressida Dick, the head of the Metropolitan police, has driven the home secretary to look for an outsider to transform the force.  Usually, the commissioner is drawn from the ranks of serving senior officers in the UK, but Home Office officials believe they could look abroad to fill the post. The Mail on Sunday claimed Patel is minded to recruit an Australian officer, such as Queensland police commissioner Katarina Carroll, who successfully overhauled the force’s troubled fire and emergency services. Patel wants an outsider who can reform the force’s culture instead of senior officers “inheriting” the job, according to the Sun on Sunday. This could include a high-flying officer from one of the UK’s smaller forces such as Simon Byrne, the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). Sources close to Patel confirmed that there is a loophole that will allow recruitment from abroad. It is “an option”, a source said, but added: “Realistically, it is going to be someone from the UK.” Former senior officers believe that a list of strong candidates has become increasingly difficult to identify because the job has become more politicised, the nature of crime has changed and London has become more diverse. Tarique Ghaffur, a former assistant commissioner in the Met who has spent the last five years advising police in the US and the Middle East on recruitment, said choosing a new leader will have to address an “expectation gap” between the politicians, the public and police officers themselves. “You need a leader who is thoughtful, who can lead a process of change, and who is going to have the political acumen and the gravitas to command support from across the political spectrum, London’s diverse communities and police officers. They will also have to understand the complex changing nature of safety, security and harm across the city. That is a tall order,” he said. Ghaffur, who was the UK’s highest ranking Muslim police officer until he left the force in 2008, said that the new commissioner will also have to have enough experience to command the respect of the Met’s 33,000 police officers while arguing for a clearout of racist, sexist and homophobic colleagues. “Once they create the values of what is acceptable and not, the new commissioner will have to be absolutely ruthless in finding and sacking those people who are guilty,” he said. While Patel holds the power over the appointment of Dame Cressida’s successor, she must take the views of Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor, into account. Their advisers are in touch and are due to speak next week, it is understood. Khan has already made it plain that he expects to see drawn-up proposals for reforming longstanding “cultural problems”. Last week, the police watchdog found “disgraceful” examples of bullying and sexual harassment at Charing Cross police station in central London. Sources close to the mayor say he is “open-minded” about who the next commissioner might be and looks forward to a strong field of candidates.",News/UK news,Priti Patel’s search for new Met police chief could include overseas candidates,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/13/priti-patels-search-for-new-met-police-chief-could-include-overseas-candidates
2/14/2022,"Even in a year outrageously overloaded with some of the most celebrated albums in rock history – the Who’s Tommy, Blind Faith, the Stones’ Let It Bleed, the Beatles’ Abbey Road, Led Zeppelin II and many more – In the Court of the Crimson King was hailed as a phenomenon. Released on Island Records in October 1969, King Crimson’s debut album was a boldly panoramic mix of hard rock, epic balladry, mystical acoustic atmospherics and squealing free jazz. As the prog-rock historian Paul Stump postulated: “If progressive rock as a discrete genre can be said to have had a starting point, In the Court of the Crimson King is probably it.” The guitarist Robert Fripp became the band’s best-known member, but the multi-instrumentalist Ian McDonald, who has died from cancer aged 75, was a galvanising force in the group’s potent mix. He was co-writer on all the album’s tracks, and his fiery saxophone soloing was a highlight of the album’s opening track, 21st Century Schizoid Man. The song’s rampaging middle section was essentially a piece called Three Score and Four, which he had composed for the army band he had played with during his military service. “That whole section is mine that I lifted from that score that I had written,” he said.  It was also at McDonald’s urging that King Crimson acquired a Mellotron sampling keyboard, able to play different sounds assigned to its various keys. This became integral to King Crimson’s sound, not least on the album’s 10-minute title track (it originally had a country and western-style tune written by Pete Sinfield, but McDonald replaced it with his own awesome melodic creation). Despite the group’s dark and heavy image, McDonald insisted: “It was fun! It was done with a tremendous amount of humour.” Crimson’s dramatic debut had been preceded by their support slot at the Rolling Stones’ Hyde Park concert in July 1969 in front of a 500,000-strong crowd, where McDonald’s saxophone solo in 21st Century Schizoid Man earned him a standing ovation, and when they toured the US later in the year they rode in on a wave of critical approbation. However, McDonald and the drummer Michael Giles felt unhappy with the group’s increasingly experimental leanings, and left in December 1969. The pair released the album McDonald and Giles (1970), then subsequently split up. McDonald played on a variety of sessions, most notably adding baritone sax to T Rex’s UK chart-topper Get It On (1971). He also did some production work with Darryl Way’s Wolf and played sax on a couple of tracks on King Crimson’s album Red (1974). In 1975 he produced Modern Masquerades by the Irish progressivists Fruupp as well as Fireballet’s Night On Bald Mountain. Then the big time came knocking again. McDonald had moved to New York, and in 1976 he was recruited by another British expat, Mick Jones, to join his new band Foreigner. Their debut album appeared the following year, sold five million copies in the US alone, and generated a trio of big hit singles, Feels Like the First Time, Cold as Ice and Long, Long Way from Home, McDonald being co-writer on the last of these. The band rapidly ballooned into one of the biggest acts of the era, hurtling to No 3 on the US chart with their second album, Double Vision (1978), another multi-million seller which produced big hits with Hot Blooded and its title track. In June 1978, McDonald found himself on a bill with the Stones again when Foreigner opened for them at Philadelphia’s JFK Stadium. Head Games (1979), like its two predecessors co-produced by McDonald, went to US No 5, and scored Top 20 hits with the title song and Dirty White Boy. However, Jones now decided that the band needed to overhaul its musical direction and sacked McDonald and another original member, Al Greenwood. “Mick wanted to pare the group down to a four-piece, so that’s what happened,” McDonald observed. “I didn’t make the cut.” He was born in Osterley, Middlesex, into a musical family which encouraged his interest in a range of styles, from classical to jazz and rock’n’roll. He taught himself the guitar, then later moved on to woodwind instruments including the flute and saxophone. He spent five years in the British Army, where he played the clarinet in a military band. As he said in a 2019 interview with the online Paste magazine: “I just loved well-written, well-played and intelligent music, and hopefully a little bit rubbed off.” He added that he made a point of listening to a Steely Dan album every day. After leaving the army he moved to London, and one of his early musical partners was the vocalist Judy Dyble, later of Fairport Convention. He then joined forces with Fripp, Michael Giles and Giles’s bass-playing brother Peter, who were calling themselves Giles, Giles and Fripp, though disagreement over their musical direction prompted them to split in mid-1968. With the addition of Sinfield and the bassist/vocalist Greg Lake, and the subtraction of Peter Giles, the original King Crimson was formed later that year. In 1996 McDonald played on the former Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett’s Genesis Revisited album and also toured with him, in concerts which included a version of In the Court of the Crimson King. In the same year, McDonald played the flute on Nothing Is Easy, from the Jethro Tull tribute album To Cry You a Song – A Collection of Tull Tales. In 2002 he joined various King Crimson veterans in 21st Century Schizoid Band, who played material from Crimson’s early albums, and in 2009 McDonald and Fripp both appeared on Dyble’s album Talking With Strangers. He released the solo albums Drivers Eyes (1999) and Take Five Steps (2019). With the band Honey West, featuring McDonald alongside the musician and actor Ted Zurkowski and with his son Maxwell McDonald on bass, he recorded Bad Old World (2017). He appeared with Foreigner for several 40th anniversary shows in 2017. He features in Toby Amies’s new documentary In the Court of the Crimson King, which traces the history of King Crimson and will premier at the SXSW film festival in March 2022.

2/14/2022,"Gusts of up to 90mph have been forecast to cause disruption across northern regions of the UK, with windy and “disturbed” weather expected across the country this week. The Met Office has issued a yellow alert for wind on Wednesday and Thursday for parts of Northern Ireland, most of Scotland and the north of England.  Road, rail, air and ferry services may be affected, with longer journey times and cancellations possible, the Met Office said. Power cuts may occur, with the potential to affect other services, such as mobile phone coverage, the forecaster added. The storm does not yet have a name. But the Met Office has not ruled out giving it one, if and when meteorologists believe it has the potential to cause an amber or red warning, meaning they judge the storm could be dangerous or cause widespread disruption. Tom Morgan, a Met Office meteorologist, said: “This whole week is going to see quite a disturbed weather pattern developing across the UK.” The worst of the wind looks likely to hit midweek, with a 24-hour weather warning coming into force from 6pm on Wednesday, stretching down from Orkney to parts of Yorkshire and Lancashire, as a weather system moves in. Morgan said: “That’s likely to bring some severe gales and possibly storm force winds to parts of this region. Western parts of Scotland look like bearing the brunt of the strongest winds, where we could see gusts of 80mph to 90mph on Wednesday night and Thursday morning. “That’s strong enough to bring some quite widespread disruption, and it’s an area of the country that’s seen several named storms this winter season already.” As part of the yellow wind warning, the forecaster said there was the potential of inland gusts of up to between 60mph and 70mph, with exposed coasts and hills getting wind speeds of up to 90mph. “It’s not just going to be strong winds this week,” said Morgan, who warned there could be snow in Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England, adding there was likely to be snow and ice warnings issued over the next few days. The bad wintery weather was not just for the northern parts of the UK. Morgan said: “The southern parts of England and Wales will see their turn. It looks very, very windy in the south at this stage for Friday. There could be some quite widespread travel disruption in parts of the UK through this week.”",News/UK news,UK weather: winds of up to 90mph forecast to disrupt northern UK,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/13/uk-weather-winds-of-up-to-90mph-forecast-to-disrupt-northern-uk
2/14/2022,"It shouldn’t be remarkable, but it is. The prime minister’s suggestion that Keir Starmer, in his former role as director of public prosecutions, was responsible for the failure to prosecute the paedophile Jimmy Savile may soon be lost to the slipstream of political memory – but for a while, for more than a brief moment, it was met by a sustained chorus of anger and criticism across the country. The BBC made clear that there was “no evidence” for the claim; other broadcasters unequivocally referred to it as a “slur” in their headlines; the former Tory chief whip and House of Commons Speaker both publicly rebuked Johnson; even one of his most loyal aides, Munira Mirza, hitched her resignation to it.  Behind the incredulous responses you could detect a sense of relief that “we are not there yet” – the “there” being a sort of post-Trump US, where QAnon conspiracy theories regularly make the headlines. But this is no moment for complacency. We are somewhere else, somewhere also troubling: a place where people are in denial about how Johnson’s Savile slur was the product of a political culture saturated with falsehoods, so often aimed at the political left and minorities. The wrongness of the Savile claim “cut through” because of the specific climate and manner in which it took place. The contempt for the man who made it, and his political position at the time – desperately lashing out to divert attention from his sinking premiership and sunken morals – made it seem lower and dirtier than if it had been made in any normal course of political business. The timing also amplified the claim, made as it was in a televised Commons session when the stakes were high, immediately after the release of Sue Gray’s damning “update”. Then there was the position of Starmer himself in this unique scenario, a protagonist sanctified in his role as representative of an angry and wounded nation. It was poor timing and optics on Johnson’s part. But, other than that, you can’t blame him for thinking that he would get away with it scot-free. All he was doing was taking part in a long, successful Conservative tradition that now involves shady extremists on social media, but has historically relied on a zealous rightwing press that brought us such smash hits as Ed Miliband, the son of the man who “hated Britain”. Let’s not forget that two Conservative prime ministers had either directly accused Jeremy Corbyn of being a “terrorist sympathiser”, or boosted claims that he had been a Soviet asset. In 2015, David Cameron called Corbyn a “security-threatening, terrorist-sympathising, Britain-hating” ideologue, using out-of-context quotes suggesting that the Labour leader was distressed by Osama bin Laden’s assassination, rather than the lack of any attempt to bring him to trial. When, in 2018, the Sun published an exposé asserting that Corbyn was a “paid collaborator” who had been “recruited” by cold war Czechoslovakian spies, Gavin Williamson, then defence secretary, ran with it. “That he met foreign spies is a betrayal of this country,” Williamson said. The Conservative MP Ben Bradley – in a since-deleted post, for which he later apologised, paying a “substantial sum” to charity – said that Corbyn had “sold British secrets to Communist spies”. When asked about the allegation, Theresa May said that Corbyn should be “open and transparent” and “account” for past actions. “The story lived on,’’ wrote the Washington Post, “provided oxygen by none other than Prime Minister Theresa May.” Cameron, whose political record in general has been buried under his colossal Brexit folly (better to be remembered as a fool than a knave), also enthusiastically embraced and promoted specious theories to support Zac Goldsmith’s London mayoral campaign against Sadiq Khan. He once said in prime minister’s questions that he was “concerned about Labour’s candidate as mayor of London” because he had “shared a platform” with a “radical imam”. Not only was that wrong: that very imam then told LBC radio that he was a Tory supporter, and felt rather bruised that he had been used to discredit Khan. Little of this is clever, studied stuff. It is more a strategy of throwing mud and hoping some sticks. If things get out of hand, then politicians soberly condemn the consequences with straight faces, as Johnson did when Starmer was harassed by anti-lockdown protesters who repeated, among other things, the Savile slur. When political rhetoric spills over into the real world, as it inevitably does, it’s attributed to an extreme minority of cranks – anti-vaxxers, lockdown sceptics, racists, loners and weirdos. But these people pick up their views from a larger cloud in which two fronts of misinformation constantly swirl – the demonisation of migrants, Muslims and other minorities, and the smearing of Labour politicians and leftwing movements as anti-British. Driving these winds is a poorly regulated press prone to having ideological motivations at worst, or being straight-up gullible at best. The Sun can publish a far-right conspiracy about a “hard-left extremist network” at the heart of the Labour party, and then delete it before the day is out, with no explanation or, more crucially, much outrage. The same goes for discredited front-page stories about Muslims fostering Christian children, and faked “plots” to take over British schools. It’s hard to look at the past decade and conclude that Johnson’s Savile slur came out of a clear blue sky. It’s a good thing that many were appalled by it, but that’s of no use if we are going to continue to be selective about which falsities we let slide in the future. It will happen again. Even Starmer’s amnesty is fading. Despite the force of the pushback to Johnson’s lie, the machine is already mobilising to defend and launder it. Before long, it will probably pass into the realm of vexatious and plausible tropes tarring the Labour party. That’s not Johnson’s or the far right’s doing alone. The truth is that, deep down, too many people who aren’t radicalised or conspiracist think targets of smears are somehow fair game, perhaps not guilty of this or that particularly outlandish offence, but generally flawed enough for lies to capture a wider truth about them. The natural outcome of this is the entrenchment of a political culture in which dangerous untruths are rife and rarely challenged. Either every one matters, or none of them do.

2/14/2022,"England showed the ruthless streak demanded by Eddie Jones as they atoned for their disappointing defeat by Scotland last week by outclassing Italy 33-0 at the Stadio Olimpico. Jones had urged his team to “light up Rome” and in response they delivered a five-try rout orchestrated by Marcus Smith, the man of the match, to inflict a 34th successive Championship defeat on the Azzurri.  England had stormed 21-0 ahead by half-time and Smith was at the heart of many of their best moments, but he truly shone when firing a superb missed pass to provide Elliot Daly with a simple try in the 45th minute. And unlike at Murrayfield a week earlier when Smith was replaced in the 63rd minute to widespread puzzlement, there was no sign of George Ford arriving off the bench until late on and this time Joe Marchant made way. Ben Youngs eventually joined him at half-back to equal Jason Leonard’s record as England’s most capped player on 114 appearances, with the round-three visit of Wales to Twickenham the likely setting for him to surpass the milestone. But, having replaced the impressive Harry Randall, Youngs entered a team who were in the midst of losing their way as Italy discovered renewed purpose to spend long spells camped in opposition territory, albeit with little end product. An England side showing six changes in personnel following their Calcutta Cup setback struggled to reimpose themselves, taking some gloss off the victory. Italy defended manfully for stretches and it took resilience to hold out against a sustained attack on their line in the first half, but they were also wasteful with the chances they created. They traditionally provide stiff opposition for an hour until eventually being worn down, but it took just nine minutes for England to get off the mark when Max Malins and Smith combined for the fly-half to score. Smith was looking to run the ball at every opportunity, but Italy also produced flashes of danger and, had their passing been more accurate, in the 17th minute they would have been over. Jack Nowell was involved in much of England’s best work but he failed an HIA following a tackle and was replaced by Daly. Big carries from Nick Isiekwe and Maro Itoje shoved Italy’s pack backwards and, as the pressure built, Jamie George burrowed over from close range. To underline the threat of complacency, the wing Federico Mori escaped down the right and might have crossed had Smith not made his covering tackle, but England were soon back on top. The maul had been an effective weapon against Scotland but an attempt to launch it on the half-hour proved unsuccessful before Itoje had a try chalked off for offside. The first half finished with George using his strength to claim his second try but the damage was done by slick handling and a piercing run from Freddie Steward. It began to look ominous for Italy as Randall weaved a path into space and their scrum conceded a penalty and, when England opted for the set-piece again, Smith flashed his classy long pass for Daly to score. The wing Montanna Ioane caused havoc in the visiting defence, showing real gas until he was well tackled by Steward who, as the last man, needed to get the hit right. Ioane’s run launched a period of Azzurri dominance that England just could not shake off and even Smith made a mistake as he knocked on in contact, but a breakaway try from Kyle Sinckler eventually completed the victory.

2/14/2022,"Boris Johnson should act immediately on Sue Gray’s recommendation to help whistleblowers raise concerns about wrongdoing, the Liberal Democrats have said, arguing the prime minister is “picking and choosing” which parts of her report to implement. Ed Davey, the party’s leader, has written to Johnson calling for action over what he called “staggering failures” in helping officials to challenge misconduct, and seeking details on how often staff had expressed worries about lockdown gatherings.  The interim report by Gray, a senior civil servant, into alleged breaches of Covid rules inside Downing Street and elsewhere in government withheld most details due to a continuing police investigation into potential lawbreaking. However, it condemned “failures of leadership and judgment”, and also warned that some staff had “wanted to raise concerns about behaviours they witnessed at work but at times felt unable to do so”. Gray recommended: “There should be easier ways for staff to raise such concerns informally, outside of the line management chain.” While Johnson has apologised for the failings, and has since significantly shaken up his senior No 10 team, Davey said there was as yet no evidence of action being taken to help would-be whistleblowers. “Boris Johnson stood up in parliament and committed to accepting Sue Gray’s findings in full,” Davey said. “But since then he has been picking and choosing what to implement, focusing on strengthening his position instead of preventing future law-breaking in No 10.” Using a parliamentary question, the party asked the Cabinet Office, which works closely alongside Downing Street, and which was connected to some claims of social gatherings, what whistleblowing guidance it had in place. The response said that “if individuals suspect wrongdoing, they have a responsibility to speak up”, stressing that this included potentially illegal actions. In his letter to Johnson, Davey said: “Reading this guidance, it is quite clear that there have been staggering failures in regards to the whistleblowing policy at the top of government. Either staff simply felt unable to raise concerns about continued social gatherings in Downing Street and the Cabinet Office, or their concerns were ignored by senior management.” Davey said that despite the reorganisation there had been no information on how to assist staff in raising worries: “It is extremely concerning that your response to this highly critical interim report has been to make changes which benefit you, rather than make it easier for your staff to report potentially criminal activity in future.” He asked Johnson to outline how many concerns about the social gatherings were raised, whether there were any consequences for whistleblowers, and to instruct Samantha Jones, the newly appointed permanent secretary of the new Office of the Prime Minister, to update the whistleblowing policy in Downing Street and the Cabinet Office “as a matter of priority”. “For the good of the country and for the sake of our national security, we need a culture in No 10 and the Cabinet Office which welcomes staff who blow the whistle – not one in which staff feel unable to speak up,” Davey wrote. “As prime minister, it is incumbent on you to understand the gravity of these concerns and urgently resolve the real problems which Sue Gray has outlined.” A Downing Street spokesperson said: “We are making immediate changes to No 10 to address the issues identified in the Sue Gray report. “This week we appointed a permanent secretary to lead the new Office for the Prime Minister. She will be reviewing the structures and operations in place to improve No 10 and ensure the team are supported to deliver on the prime minister’s agenda.”",News/Politics,"Johnson must act on Gray report’s whistleblower proposals, say Lib Dems",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/13/johnson-must-act-on-gray-reports-whistleblower-proposals-say-lib-dems
2/14/2022,"In a year when Jürgen Klopp has spent £50m on a forward, Liverpool seem to have gained a prolific scorer. Not Luis Diaz – or not yet, anyway – but Fabinho. Klopp’s title hopes may be faint but they could have been extinguished without his newly potent holding midfielder. Fabinho’s fifth goal of 2022 reduced the gap to Manchester City to nine points; had it not been scored by the man who shields the back four, the temptation would have been to call it a poacher’s goal, scrambled in from half a yard and showing a predatory instinct associated more with strikers.  The importance of a clinical touch was underlined as Burnley lacked one. Their last 850 minutes of top-flight football have yielded them a mere three goals, just as they have a solitary league win at Turf Moor in more than a year. One unwanted statistic ought to have changed and another could have done courtesy of a first half when they had the superior chances. And yet, thanks to Fabinho, Burnley went in with a deficit. Unlike against Manchester United on Tuesday, there was no comeback. Their local derbies next season seem likelier to involve Wigan and Blackpool than Liverpool and United. For Liverpool, however, it felt the definition of a hard-fought win. Troubled initially, they ended up triumphant. Unconvincing before the interval, when neither Virgil van Dijk nor Joël Matip looked particularly commanding, they played with greater authority after Fabinho struck. While Klopp believes this is the strongest squad he has ever had at his disposal, he could be grateful a minor injury altered his best-laid plans. The initial intention was for Sadio Mané to be a substitute. Promoted to start because of Diogo Jota’s dead leg, he proved the brightest of Klopp’s front three, taking the momentum he gained in the African Cup of Nations to a different continent and a very different climate. Diaz was spared a baptism of wind, rain and cold. Even by Burnley’s standards, it was inclement weather. If the stereotype suggested it was scarcely a day for Brazilians, Fabinho proved otherwise. If his was the most prosaic of goals, it was also revealing. Liverpool are the division’s set-piece specialists and, when they struggled to create in open play, they forged two clear openings from Trent Alexander-Arnold’s dead-ball delivery and Mané’s elusiveness. There were two saves from Nick Pope, but with a different consequence. When Mané met the right-back’s free kick with a half-volley, it thudded into Pope’s chest and rebounded to safety. When the winger stooped to head Alexander-Arnold’s corner, Fabinho stole in behind James Tarkowski to shoot. Pope saved, but the midfielder scored at the second attempt. After four goals in 142 games, this was his fifth in seven. Apart from a Naby Keïta shot he clawed away, Pope was relatively untroubled. Along with a scuffed effort from the substitute Jota, the closest Liverpool came to a goal in open play was when Ben Mee almost turned Alexander-Arnold’s late cross into his own net. The visiting defence were subjected to a stiffer examination. Burnley seemed to have regained their sense of purpose in the second half against United. Once again, they were awkward, aggressive, attritional opponents. There were points where it appeared the quintessential Burnley performance, save for the most important element: the finish. If aspects of Wout Weghorst’s game suggest the giant Dutchman may be an upgrade on the departed Chris Wood, definitive judgments may be formed on the basis of their respective goal tallies. The former Wolfsburg forward’s wait for a first Burnley strike goes on after a golden chance was spurned. Liverpool were caught on the counter-attack after their corner. Ashley Westwood led it, Jay Rodriguez slid his strike partner in on goal and while Weghorst dinked his shot over Alisson, it was going wide even before Alexander-Arnold hacked it away. He was off target again later, drilling a half-volley past the post, after Connor Roberts’s ball over the top. Rodriguez had ended an 11-month wait for a league goal against Manchester United but he proved profligate. When Van Dijk, who seemed disconcerted by the Burnley gales, turned Maxwel Cornet’s free kick into his path, Rodriguez’s touch was poor and Alisson saved, just as he had earlier denied Josh Brownhill. He was not the only Brazilian to prevail in Burnley.

2/14/2022,"It always seemed likely to be a close-run thing whether Antonio Conte would break Tottenham or Tottenham would break Conte, and at the moment it is the Spursiness that is on top. Conte’s five league titles may have come in a perpetual frenzy of touchline fury, but he was reduced in the second half to wandering disconsolately around his technical area, giving the occasional bark of disappointment. After a nine-game unbeaten run in the league after his appointment, three successive defeats mean the honeymoon is definitively over. With familiarity, ingrained habits are beginning to grate. Why can they not put their trousers on the hanger? Why can’t they ever take the rubbish out? Why will they not do the absolute basics of defending?  Games in hand mean Spurs are still well-placed in the race for fourth behind West Ham and Manchester United, but this defeat means they now have Wolves as well as Arsenal in their way. Bruno Lage’s Wolves can have a pleasantly soporific quality, like tropical fish in a tank. You start watching the patterns and before you know it five or six minutes have gone by and nothing much has happened. But that still doesn’t quite explain the collective switch-off that led to Tottenham going behind in the sixth minute. Raúl Jiménez’s goal was a case study of everything that’s been going wrong with Spurs this season. Unable to handle the Wolves press just as they had been unable to handle Southampton last Wednesday, Spurs conceded a cheap free-kick. Harry Kane’s headed clearance was probably a little more central than would have been ideal, but it would not have been a major problem had anybody followed it out. As it was, Rúben Neves was given time to measure a shot – that’s Rúben Neves who has scored 14 times from outside the area in his four and a half years at Wolves; why would you bother closing him down? Hugo Lloris, troubled by an awkward bounce just in front of him, shovelled the ball out to Leander Dendoncker and although the goalkeeper was able to recover to palm out his mis-hit shot, Jiménez rammed in the rebound. And all the Tottenham defenders, rabbits trapped in a pinball machine, looked on in uneasy bemusement. Some Tottenham fans disregarded the club's request to ""move on"" from using the Y-word by chanting it in the opening moments of the league game with Wolves. It was the first outing at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium since the club released results of consultation with supporters, which revealed 94% of 23,000 people asked acknowledged it was a racist word. Spurs said in a statement: ""We recognise how these members of our fanbase feel and we also believe it is time to move on from associating this term with our club."" But the request was met with resistance on social media when it was announced and the fans showed no signs of taking it on board inside their stadium. Chants of ""Y** Army"" were audible from within the first couple of minutes and continued throughout the game. Spurs fans have traditionally used the word, which is seen as anti-Semitic, as a way of standing up to abuse that began in the late 1970s and it is still used commonly at games today. PA Media They played a much more active role in Wolves’s second. Lloris, almost passing the ball out for a corner, put Ben Davies under pressure, squandering possession as Wolves closed him down. Daniel Podence’s shot hit Davinson Sánchez, ricocheted on to Rodrigo Bentancur, cannoned against the post and fell for Dendoncker to knock in. And to think there had been doubts as to whether the Uruguayan would be able to adapt to the new environment. Conte had accused his side of being too emotional against Southampton; here they looked apathetic, bordering on the comatose. His reaction was to take off Ryan Sessegnon for Dejan Kulusevski after 28 minutes and to switch from the back three to a 4-2-3-1, and perhaps, given how Spurs were being swamped in the middle of midfield, there was a tactical logic to that. The influence of Neves, certainly, waned with Kulusevski occupying a similar zone. But, frankly, if players stand and watch the ball bounce around them, the formation is a secondary concern. The issue is even deeper than that. Bentancur, perhaps, will bring the requisite quality on the ball at the back of midfield, but for a couple of seasons, certainly since the departures of Mousa Dembélé and Christian Eriksen, Spurs have had nobody who can hold the ball under pressure. Tanguy Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso were both sidelined quickly by Conte and loaned out in January. Pierre-Emile Højbjerg, whose form has dipped since the Italian arrived, was left out – the first time that has happened at Spurs when he has been available – an indication perhaps that he doesn’t quite fit the Conte blueprint. Tottenham were better in the second half and perhaps a comeback might have been sparked had Harry Winks’s drive been deflected in rather than against the outside of the post, but Wolves had chances as well, and it took a number of saves from Lloris to keep Spurs in it. And the point, anyway, is that no side with Champions League aspirations can just be giving two goals away, especially not against an immediate rival. Conte has been in charge for 19 games and kept just five clean sheets. If Spurs are to finish in the top four, that is nowhere near good enough.",Sport/Football,Jiménez and Dendoncker feast on Tottenham’s gifts to earn win for Wolves,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/13/tottenham-wolves-premier-league-match-report
2/14/2022,"The film that everyone is talking about this year in Berlin is the dazzlingly accomplished and confident debut feature from the 42-year-old Mexican-Bolivian film-maker Natalia López Gallardo; as a former editor, she has worked with Lisandro Alonso and Carlos Reygadas, whose various influences are detectable in the movie’s mixture of languour and shock. The title appears to refer to a Buddhist parable about the man who lives in poverty, not knowing that a wealthy friend has securely but invisibly sewn a precious gem into his robe so that he would not have to live like this: the allusion is one of the many opaque and difficult things about this film. It is a disturbing and unsettling piece of work, a psycho-pathological moodboard of a film, in which guilt, horror and shame poison the atmosphere. Exactly what is going on has to be inferred through the indirect hints and cloudy indications; these are never finally and definitively revealed, and I can’t be absolutely sure that this obscurity is not a first-time film-maker’s flaw. But Gallardo certainly has a fluent cinematic language at her command.  This is a story of crime, class and corruption in modern Mexico. Isabel (Nailea Norvind) is a wealthy woman with two children, Benja (Balam Toledo) and Vale (Sherlyn Zavala Diaz). Her marriage is evidently unravelling, and she is taking the kids to move into the derelict modernist villa once owned by her late mother, an imperious woman we see in flashback. The maid there, Maria (Antonia Olivares) is haunted by the disappearance of her sister, a grimly commonplace situation since kidnappings and murders are the staple of Mexico’s criminal classes – along of course with drugs. Police searches show us that this woman’s body may actually be buried in the grounds. Maria has another secret: rising young mobster Adan (Juan Daniel García Treviño) has some sort of hold over her, and indeed over his own police officer mother Torta (Aida Roa), who is disgusted both with her son’s involvement with crime and her own complicity in cartel operations, blandly expected of her by her own superior officers. And at the centre of it all, Isabel is apparently convulsed with a need to solve the mystery of Maria’s sister, but also to be hurt and punished. Is her self-hate and self-harm a symptom of a poison in the spiritual water supply? Or her hatred of her mother? Her possibly abusive husband? Closeups on Norvind’s face show someone pulsing with suppressed rage and despair. It is a film whose procedural wooziness deliberately renders the audience more vulnerable to its moments of high-impact, zero-trigger-warning shock; these are managed with great skill and brilliant cinematography by Adrian Durazo. But, like the work of Reygadas, I have an uneasy feeling that the brilliance of these flourishes, particularly the climactic and dreamlike slo-mo sequence, might show a certain creative immaturity – impressive and effective though they are. Yet there is also a fierce, high seriousness to the way that Gallardo is addressing the buried, denied crimes of the Mexican state and the Mexican ruling classes. It has the dimensions of tragedy.

2/14/2022,"As Eddie Howe ran out of players to embrace and, wreathed in smiles, finally walked off the pitch he looked up towards the directors’ box and blew his wife a kiss. If she had not already realised it, this was surely the day when Vicki Howe fully understood precisely why her husband wanted to be the manager of Newcastle United.  Three wins in a row have not merely lifted a once apparently doomed side out of the relegation zone but breathed new life into a club transformed under their controversial new Saudi Arabian-led ownership. Played out against a backdrop of vigorously waved black and white flags and a soundtrack alternating between “Eddie Howe’s black and white army” and “Blaydon Races”, this was an afternoon when, despite the chill February rain, anything seemed possible. Admittedly Newcastle rode their luck a little in the second half but with Kieran Trippier on their side, mid-table seemed to beckon. Trippier always seemed a very decent signing on Newcastle’s part but England’s former Atlético Madrid right-back looks an even better buy almost by the minute. £12m was spent on Trippier as much for his crossing and dead ball acumen as his defensive attributes and when his side won a free-kick fractionally outside the 18 yard area there was only one man for the job. That set piece was awarded after a VAR review had overruled Craig Pawson’s initial decision to give a penalty after Calum Chambers sent the accelerating Joe Willock tumbling. If Villa were relieved it proved an extremely temporary reprieve. Sure enough Trippier, captaining Newcastle in Jamaal Lascelles’s absence, stepped forward to power his kick through the wall and, courtesy of a slight deflection off Emiliano Buendía, on past a wrong footed Emiliano Martínez. Until then Villa had largely succeeded in frustrating Howe’s team. Pressing high and hard, Gerrard’s players refused to allow Jonjo Shelvey and company time on the ball in midfield, while no matter where he wandered, the assiduously marked Allan Saint-Maximin was allowed precious little room for manoeuvre. Yet hard as John McGinn worked in the visiting midfield and as undeniably successful as Villa were in forcing Newcastle to resort to sending Chris Wood chasing long balls and lost causes, they created very few chances of their own. A big part of that was down to Dan Burn’s excellence at the heart of the home defence. The £13m recruit from Brighton was making his debut in place of Lascelles and on this assured evidence, the club captain may struggle to reclaim his place. Indeed with Philippe Coutinho not so much tamed as rendered totally anonymous by Tripper’s shadowing, Martin Dubravka was rarely called to arms in goal, Villa’s attacking talent remained dormant until a potential watershed was reached, two minutes into the second half. When, to collective groans, a calf injury forced Trippier off both Gerrard and Coutinho sensed opportunity. Emil Krafth had barely stepped off the bench before the latter was skipping away from him. Within seconds Coutinho had unleashed a defence-bisecting through ball and although Ollie Watkins could not quite make the most of it, Howe and his assistant, Jason Tindall, exchanged anxious technical area glances. Such nervousness swiftly looked well founded. Inspired by an apparently reborn Coutinho, Gerrard’s attack were finally ruffling Burn and company and when Watkins headed the fallout from Lucas Digne’s low cross and Coutinho’s deflected shot beyond Dubravka it appeared Howe’s worst fears had been realised. In the event VAR came to the Newcastle manager’s rescue, its review detecting the tightest, most fractional, of offsides against Watkins. If Villa’s striker was left possibly wishing he had clipped his toenails before kick off, history was not on Gerrard’s side. Villa had not won at St James’ Park since 2005 – the day Newcastle’s Kieron Dyer and Lee Bowyer engaged in an on-pitch fist fight – and their second half improvement was never quite sufficient to change that narrative. A brief hiatus in the wake of an incident high in the Gallowgate End involving a spectator requiring urgent medical attention saw Pawson halt play and call the players to the side of the pitch, but Newcastle returned with concentration apparently intensified.",Sport/Football,Trippier’s free-kick against Aston Villa earns third straight win for Newcastle,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/13/newcastle-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report
2/14/2022,"Crash! Screech! Kaboom! These are some of the sounds of Ozploitation movies: an explosively entertaining category of cinema that offered a very different experience to the more vaunted “Australian new wave” (although some films could be categorised as both). I have limited the scope of the titles below to adult-oriented genre films (the kind that wouldn’t look out of place at a drive cinema) produced in the 70s and 80s. From sexcapades to car movies and a creature feature, here are the very best.  The sexploitation film is a subgenre of Ozploitation, soiling bedsheets and outraging prudes since the early 70s. Graeme Blundell stars in the two all-time greatest – drawing a dead heat in this list. In Alvin Purple, Blundell plays a man who tries to avoid sex but whom all women find irresistible; in The Naked Bunyip he’s hired by an advertising agency to conduct a survey on sex in Australia. The latter became the stuff of legend when the censors banned several scenes; in response, director John B Murray and producer Phillip Adams blacked out the screen and inserted footage of a cartoon bunyip. Few things in human history have been as wild as Dennis Hopper after a bottle of spirits. Anecdotes about the making of Philippe Mora’s bushranger action-drama, starring a fake beard-wearing Hopper as the all-guns-blazin’ protagonist, are almost as entertaining as the film itself. Beginning as a penal colony-era prison movie, Mad Dog Morgan morphs into a story of friendship (between Morgan and his partner in crime, played by David Gulpilil) then one of proto-celebrity – or perhaps “notoriety” is a better way to put it. The film’s scratchy, earthy vibes suits its bush settings. In 1998, to mark Stone’s 25th anniversary, more than 30,000 bikers congregated in Sydney to recreate the film’s iconic funeral scene – speaking to the enduring legacy and intense if niche fandom associated with Sandy Harbutt’s scrappy classic. Biker gang The Gravediggers allow a detective (Ken Shorter) to go undercover with them, in order to investigate the murder of gang members. The plot structure is haphazard and the ride, so to speak, is bumpy. But the film’s energy prevails, and it’s full of small moments of visual innovation. In this fabulously flaky superhero outing Alan Arkin plays the titular character, who, in a proto-Hancock and The Incredibles-esque plotline, fights Nazis and busts up bootleggers until the US government takes him to court for wearing undies in public. The Cap buggers off to Australia and becomes a hopeless alcoholic, but ultimately takes up the fight against Christopher Lee’s nefarious supervillain. The film is a musical (because of course it is) with songs written by The Rocky Horror Picture Show’s Richard O’Brien, including this irresistible rumination on the nature of good and evil: Before Squid Game and The Hunger Games there was this batshit crazy tournament movie, full of splatter and carnage, set in an Orwellian future where the underclass are prey for a sport played by wealthy sadists, determined to chase and kill them before sundown. Nothing was too weird for this deliriously harebrained narrative, which includes a toe-eating werewolf-like monster and one of the most breathtakingly evil prison guards in cinema history – played by shiny-scalped legend Roger Ward. Brian Trenchard-Smith’s characteristically energetic martial arts movie plus car movie plus cop movie plus all-round action explodapalooza follows a Chinese special agent (Jimmy Wang Yu) who infiltrates a criminal network led by a gangster played by George Lazenby – aka “the Australian 007.” There are great stunts, a cracking pace and very well staged sequences, including a thrilling eight-and-a-half-minute car chase that would surely have inspired George Miller’s Mad Max movies. Terry Bourke’s meat pie western never achieved all that much street cred, which is a shame because the film is top notch – beginning in jaunty Sergio Leone mode and culminating with a magnificently suspenseful finale. In the titular inn, circa the late 1800s, guests are murdered in their sleep by its maniacal owners (Dame Judith Anderson and Joseph Fürst), making the place a kind of Bates Motel Down Under. Determined to outsmart them, the hero (Alex Cord) must stay awake in a room fitted out with a bed that doubles as an elaborate death machine. In director Peter Weir’s feature debut, a young crash survivor (Terry Camilleri) is stranded in a small town where the economy relies on a steady supply of wrecked vehicles – a premise ripe with satirical and allegorical undertones. There’s intergenerational tension between the town’s lead-footed young hotheads, who drive freaky chunks of twisted metal, and the older folk, as well as a mayor (John Meillon) who declares that nobody is ever allowed to leave. The meaning of the film is cryptic, adding a serious, curious subtext under the bonnet. The animatronic pig in Russell Mulcahy’s style-saturated creature feature isn’t great – but, like in Jaws, this forced the director to cut around it and innovate elsewhere, resulting in a film that succeeds magnificently despite its limitations. The plot is thin, involving a grizzled man (Bill Kerr) as dedicated to finding the boar that took his grandson as Captain Ahab was to nailing Moby Dick. But its artery-choking atmosphere is so thick you could cut it with a knife. A new nurse (Susan Penhaligon) at a private Melbourne hospital is warned that “the salary’s minimal, the hours abominable”. But nothing could prepare her for Patrick: the titular character who is an intensely … horizontal presence, lying in bed comatose throughout the experience, with the ability to make all kinds of bad things happen due to his psychokinetic powers. Richard Franklin’s unforgettable midnight movie is a great example of creating a lot from a little, and wringing suspense by cutting around a villain. Another stroke of genius from Richard Franklin, here in full-blown Hitchcockian mode, delivering a shrewdly calibrated thriller. A truck driver (Stacey Keach) en route from Melbourne to Perth passes the time by imagining the stories of strangers on the road. When he comes to believe another driver might be a killer, is he imagining it, or is he on to something? Quentin Tarantino was on the money when he said: “You could remake Road Games tomorrow and not change a damn word for it and it would scare the hell out of everybody.” It’s not difficult to introduce a scary villain: just put some dude in a mask and give ’em a chainsaw. The tantalising question at the heart of Colin Eggleston’s sort of horror, sort of relationship drama is whether there even is a villain in the first place. A bickering couple (John Hargreaves and Briony Behets) disrespect the environment on their camping trip, tossing a cigarette butt out the window and killing a dugong. So Mother Nature brings together birds, insects and animals to take them down. Or … is it all just a coincidence? The menace is everywhere and nowhere: in the trees, in the water, in the sand, and HOLY HELL IT’S RIGHT BEHIND YOU! A dystopian social allegory set in a drive-in cinema doubling as a microcosm of society? Genius! When a young man (Ned Manning) borrows his brother’s vintage car to impress his girlfriend (Natalie McCurry) at said drive-in, they find themselves unable to leave, discovering the drive-in is a society unto itself – with its own economy (even its own currency) and political factions. The protagonist’s determination to bust out leads one of Ozploitation’s most iconic images: a Great Escape-like moment involving bright lights, broken timber and a sensationally airborne vehicle. The first two of George Miller’s face-melting classics have been lumped into one hellzapoppin entry. After the director introduced his road warrior to audiences in 1979, action cinema was never the same. For a long time the original – a wild revenge movie and origin story for Mel Gibson’s angry antihero – was the most profitable feature film made anywhere in the world. The sequel cranked up the production values, with more spectacular BDSM-like outfits and one of the greatest chase scenes of all time. Ted Kotcheff’s 1971 masterpiece – for decades considered lost until eventually found in a box marked for destruction – is so damn good, and so damn ’strayan, it both epitomises and transcends the Ozploitation genre, offering the midnight movie crowd something seriously brilliant to chew over. Following an English high school teacher (John Grant) who is driven to madness in a small outback town, Kotcheff builds a dread-inducing atmosphere, clogged full of dust and sweat. You don’t so much watch this film as feel it; pressing “play” is like opening an oven door and getting hit with a blast of hot air.",Arts/Culture,The 17 greatest Ozploitation movies – sorted ,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/14/the-17-greatest-ozploitation-movies-sorted
2/14/2022,"At the back end of last year, stretching into the early part of this, the AFF Suzuki Cup, the biennial showpiece of Southeast Asian football, did what it always does: deliver unscriptable drama, unparalleled entertainment, and shine a spotlight on the emerging talents within southeast Asia. The names of Thailand’s Supachok Sarachat, Indonesia’s Alfeandra Dewangga or Malaysia’s Safawi Rasid might not be familiar to fans here in Australia, but they shone in Singapore and are the sort of talent the Australian Professional Leagues, now in charge of the running of the A-League Men’s competition, will be hoping to attract to Australia with the proposed introduction of the ‘plus one’ rule for the competition.  The ‘plus one’ rule has been widely adopted across Asia but stubbornly rejected time after time in Australia, with one former A-League club owner insultingly suggesting it would “ ... compromise the product we provide”. The rule sets aside one foreign place specifically for a player from an AFC member nation to encourage greater movement of players within the continent, with the APL proposing to change to A-League Men’s quota from five foreigners to four plus one. Its implementation across Asia has opened up a whole host of opportunities for Australian players across the continent from Japan to the Gulf and everywhere in between, but to date the open door has not been reciprocated. Quite why it has taken the clubs this long to jump on board, especially after the resounding success of the AFC Asian Cup in 2015, is a question only they can answer. But, better late than never. “One of the unique selling points of our sport is that if you think about the DNA of football, the game in this country has been built on migrant populations coming to the country and assimilating into the community through football,” APL chief Danny Townsend told the Sydney Morning Herald. “That being the case, why aren’t we leveraging our near neighbours who have a significant cohort of migrants in our country and are football first countries?” Why indeed. But there is more to it than just signing players. If the clubs want to unlock the league’s true potential, they engage these communities. Both here and further abroad they must approach that mission in a holistic manner. It cannot be done by just signing any one player. While important, that must be one piece of a much larger puzzle; one which requires a long-term vision and mindset. The J.League has set the blueprint for how to engage with the region. It involves the league and clubs showing a commitment to developing links within the respective countries, not just pillaging their best talent. The J.League has created a dedicated department within its operations that is solely focused on their international outreach. On the back of the success of Thai trio Chanathip Songkrasin, Theerathon Bunmathan (who won the J.League under Ange Postecoglou at Yokohama F.Marinos) and Teerasil Dangda, the league created a Thai-language Facebook page, with content curated specifically for a Thai audience, that has grown to a touch under half a million followers. It is no surprise that Japan is seen as the pinnacle destination in Asian football. In the case of Australia, which has at times had a difficult relationship with our nearest neighbours, showing sincerity and commitment is even more important. It demonstrates a willingness to be a good citizen of the region, and ultimately Australia stands to benefit from an increase in quality. Finding the right player who can not only contribute on the pitch but also aid ambitions off will not be easy. It requires scouting, connections and know-how, all stuff that takes years to curate. We are also competing for talent against the J.League, and now the K League, both of which are more developed and have stronger reputations across Asia. It also requires patience. Despite what some may think, getting players, especially from Southeast Asia, to take the plunge and move abroad is not an easy task. There are strong familial ties and cultural barriers keeping them in their homelands. For example, Vietnam’s Nguyen Quang Hai, who shone against the Socceroos last month, is arguably the best player in southeast Asia and yet, despite reported interest from abroad, including in Japan, no one has yet been able to prize him away from the vice-like grip of his club, Hanoi FC. The club and league who do tempt him away – if anyone can – will benefit enormously, like the J.League has done from the success of Chanathip. To do so that club will need to sell a vision, s pathway for the player to bigger and better things. In the example of Chanathip, after two years establishing himself as one of the league’s better attacking talents, he has this year signed for defending champions Kawasaki Frontale and will be playing in and challenging for the AFC Champions League – the pinnacle of club football in Asia. As Australia tumbles down the AFC club rankings and risks falling out of the AFC Champions League completely – a topic for another day – the question we need to ask ourselves is simple: what is the vision we are selling a player like Nguyen Quang Hai?",Sport/Football,A-League Men plus one rule must be just one piece of a much larger Asia puzzle | Paul Williams,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/14/a-league-men-plus-one-rule-must-be-just-one-piece-of-a-much-larger-asia-puzzle
2/14/2022,"A proposed new coal-fired power station at Collinsville in north Queensland is now being pitched as a “flexible” firming project – a pivot that neatly aligns with federal government moves to bankroll such plans. The federal government controversially gave Shine Energy $3.3m in 2020 to conduct a feasibility study into the Collinsville plant. In a press release announcing the grant, government backbencher Michelle Landry said the generator would provide “affordable baseload power”.  But information flyers distributed by the company in Collinsville appear to show the company has realised baseload coal plants are no longer viable, given the rapid proliferation of solar and other renewables in the energy grid. Shine Energy is now using the term “flexible HELE” (high-efficiency, low-emissions) technology to describe the proposed plant. The Shine Energy flyer said: “The project is being designed to ramp up and down and be placed on standby as directed by the Australian Energy Market Operator.” “[The pre-feasibility study found] the increasing level of renewable generation, and in particular solar generation, has changed the role of coal power plants from baseload to load-following.” Energy analysts said the assessment of the market is essentially correct – that the grid requires some firming capacity to support large-scale renewable generation at times when renewables are not productive. But they said coal is the least flexible technology and the heaviest emitter. “It’s technically possible [for a coal power station to be more flexible], but the ramp rate of a coal plant is a snail’s pace compared to gas peaking, and that’s snail’s pace compared to a battery,” said Tim Buckley, a market analyst and the director of Climate Energy Finance. “They may be able to build in some flexibility, but you’re talking [about] a really expensive piece of kit.” Buckley said that because of the infrequent and inconsistent need for ramping power and the rapid uptake of cheaper renewables, the sort of flexible coal plant described by Shine Energy was “totally unbankable [without] massive ongoing government subsidies and a massive ongoing exemption from carbon pricing”. While analysts say it is extremely unlikely a flexible coal plant would generate private investment, particularly given the shift in global finance away from coal, there remains the prospect that Collinsville could be built with sufficient federal government support. The government has cited the need to provide firming capacity as justification to subsidise otherwise unviable projects, like the $600m decision to build the Kurri Kurri gas project, which only expects to run at 2% of its capacity each year. There are some signs the federal government may also seek to subsidise coal to provide firming capacity. The Shine Energy Collinsville project has already been the subject of questions after it was invited to apply for a $3.3m federal grant for a feasibility study two days after being announced as the recipient. The National Audit Office raised concern about parts of that grant process. Shine Energy’s pitch leans heavily on arguments the coal plant will support the uptake of renewables, given the inflexibility of the national energy market’s existing coal power stations. The company claims its technology would create 25% less emissions than the average coal-fired power station in the NEM fleet. But both Buckley and the director of the climate and energy program at the Australia Institute, Richie Merzian, say that would still result in a relatively dirty power station. “The … Australian coal-fired power fleet is the highest emitting in the world,” Buckley said. “This plant will be about as carbon-intensive as the average plant in Japan. It’s still 100% more carbon intensive [than] any wind or solar project.” The company also makes unfounded claims that coal can be burned with “zero emissions” via future advances in carbon capture, storage and utilisation technology. Such technologies remain largely ineffective and unproven. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Despite $4bn in government commitments for carbon capture and storage in the last 20 years there isn’t a single ‘clean coal’ project in operation in Australia,” Merzian said. “It is not just wrong but dangerous to claim coal power can be ‘zero emissions’. The first step in addressing climate change is to stop growing the problem and coal is hands down the single largest source of greenhouse gas emissions.” Shine Energy chief executive, Ashley Dodd, did not address specific questions. He said: “We are proud Australian Birriah/Widi Traditional Owners committed to economic sovereignty for our people with an energy project that will provide benefit for the nation. “It is a shame the anti-nation-state globalist outlets like the Guardian are constantly attacking an Australian Birriah/Widi Traditional Owner-driven project like this.” The information given to Collinsville locals suggests the proposed plant would not be operational until 2026.",News/Australia news,Experts sceptical of Shine Energy’s proposed ‘flexible’ coal power station,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/14/experts-sceptical-of-shine-energys-proposed-flexible-coal-power-station
2/14/2022,"Roughly one in three Australians have confidence in the Morrison government, which is the lowest approval since the 2019-20 summer bushfires, according to a survey. The latest instalment of the Australian National University’s research of wellbeing during the Covid-19 pandemic found that in January satisfaction in Australia’s direction and the federal government both dropped.  The longitudinal survey of 3,472 Australians was conducted in the final two weeks of January, as the Omicron wave and eased restrictions resulted in some days with more than 100,000 new Covid cases, and new records for the deadliest days. The ANU’s Centre for Social Research and Methods found 34.5% of adult Australians had confidence or were “very confident” in the federal government, down from a peak of 60.6% in May 2020. The result is only slightly higher than the low of 27.3% recorded during the 2019-20 bushfires. Confidence also declined in the public service, down to 57.6%, and in state and territory governments, down to 52.3%, but these institutions were still rated higher than the federal government. Between October 2021 and January 2022 satisfaction in the direction of the country fell to 63.6%, about the same level as the Delta wave of Covid in mid-2021. In January, just 40% of Australians thought “the worst of the pandemic is behind us”, down from 54.6% in October when lockdowns that successfully suppressed the Delta wave began to be lifted. As infection rates rose, so did Australians’ expectations that they would get Covid in the next six months, up from 40% in October to 80% in January. Almost a quarter of the adult population (22.4%) reported that they could not get tested when they wanted to. Of those, three-quarters (75.6%) blamed being “unable to find a rapid antigen test in my local area”. In early January Scott Morrison’s government promised to make rapid antigen tests free for concession cardholders after Labor promised free tests for all, but the scheme got off to a slow start due to supply issues. In February Morrison started the political year in an appearance at the National Press Club in which he offered an apology, of sorts, for the handling of the pandemic. “We’re all terribly sorry for what this pandemic has done to the world and to this country,” he said. Morrison conceded the government had been “too optimistic” and that “in raising those expectations about the summer, that we heightened the great sense of disappointment that people felt” when the Omicron wave increased cases, hospitalisations and deaths. The ANU study concluded that it was “always going to be necessary to open the country and ease restrictions that have been some of the most draconian in the developed world” and that it was inevitable this would “lead to a large increase in Covid-19 cases”. “But it was not anticipated that the opening would coincide with the new Omicron variant of the virus that while milder in terms of health consequences was far more infectious,” the study said. “It would appear from the data presented in this paper that at least in the short term the positive impacts of the easing of restrictions … have not outweighed the impact of a dramatic increase in infections and a smaller, but still considerable increase in hospitalisation and mortality.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Study co-author Prof Nicholas Biddle said the survey also found a “decline in confidence in hospitals and the health system, the largest we have seen during the pandemic”. “Although people are still quite confident in the health system, clearly the handling of the pandemic and the ongoing wave of Omicron infections is starting to take a real toll on how all major institutions are viewed by Australians,” he said. In January, Guardian’s Essential poll also showed Morrison’s approval reaching its lowest point of the Covid pandemic, although voters’ anger cooled in February after the Omicron wave had peaked.",News/Australia news,"Only a third of Australians have confidence in Morrison government, survey finds",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/14/only-a-third-of-australians-have-confidence-in-morrison-government-survey-finds
2/14/2022,"When Claire Simpson turned 50 in early 2020, she received a letter telling her to get a mammogram. Then the pandemic hit, and Victoria went into lockdown. “Like many people, I put it off until we were coming out of that lockdown, but by then it was September and I couldn’t get an appointment until December,” she says.  In February 2021 she was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a mastectomy. Tests showed she was positive for the aggressive HER2 receptor, so she began 12 weeks of chemotherapy as well as a treatment called Herceptin, which she received an IV infusion of every three weeks. Simpson says the delay in screening “really, really delayed diagnosis for me, by a good six months”. “I can’t help but feel that [an earlier screening] could have probably saved me from having to have chemotherapy and this Herceptin infusion therapy that I’m having,” she says. Her last Herceptin treatment was last Wednesday. She has been living in self-imposed lockdown, terrified as the Omicron wave built that she would have to isolate due to Covid and disrupt her treatment. That self-imposed isolation will continue until her final surgery, an elective operation scheduled for mid-year. Navigating a cancer diagnosis in a pandemic requires a particular level of fortitude. Family and friends are not allowed to sit with you for hours in hospital, and two years of staggered lockdowns have interrupted travel and important get-togethers. Activities which may be low-risk for others – like going to the supermarket in a mask or attending a picnic – become high risk. While the Omicron variant is less severe, high rates of infection in the eastern states have had a significant impact on the healthcare workforce, interrupting continuity of care and straining already overloaded systems. Fear of contracting Covid also means many people are avoiding going to their GP or putting off essential screening, as Simpson did. Cancer screening dropped by 10% in Victoria alone in the first year of the pandemic. In 2021, referrals to the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, a leading treatment and research facility in Melbourne, were down 40%. “That is certainly going to bounce back at some point,” says Prof Sherene Loi, an oncologist and researcher at Peter MacCallum. “It is potentially going to be a real problem in a few years’ time. At the moment we have a lot of very young cancer diagnoses, a lot of breast cancer … we are just flat chat.” Loi has so far avoided having to isolate as a close contact, but her colleagues have been less lucky. “There’s lots of staff shortages, there’s lots of staff being furloughed because of their children coming home and giving them Covid,” she says. “When I came back from holidays, I was pretty much the only one in clinic. It’s very, very busy and crazy from a staff shortage point of view and constantly trying to replace staff. “And the patients are definitely more anxious in this wave because there’s so much more Covid around – they’re anxious about what’s going to happen when they get Covid, and whether they will get the right treatment, and having to reorganise scans and chemo.” Despite the “disorganisation and chaos”, Loi says, surgeries and traditional therapies like chemotherapy have continued. The impact has been on new therapies and clinical trials, particularly for people with terminal cancer. “I don’t think anyone’s care has been compromised,” she says. “But from my point of view, doing research and clinical trials and drug development, a lot of people have probably missed out on that because we haven’t had the resources to do more innovative stuff that could make a difference.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning For most patients, Loi says, the main impact has been having to attend treatment alone. Simpson’s mother also had breast cancer; she celebrated 10 years cancer-free just before Simpson was diagnosed. Not being able to have her support in hospital for the latter half of her chemotherapy, which coincided with the Delta lockdown, was difficult. “It’s quite isolating to go through something like that without being able to have support people with you,” she says. “I also live alone, so I’m going home to an empty house as well.” Another woman, who asked that her name not be used, was diagnosed with breast cancer last May and had to ask a friend to drive her up to three hours for treatment only to walk into the hospital alone. She recalls sitting alongside a teenage girl, also alone, who cried throughout the two-hour chemotherapy session. “It is uncomfortable, it is difficult, but you don’t have to look far to find people who are doing it worse,” she says. The 58-year-old was diagnosed after a routine mammogram, then had three rounds of surgery including a mastectomy, then four rounds of chemotherapy and three weeks of radiotherapy. Her radiotherapy coincided with the Omicron wave, with her last session on 25 January. The weekend before she was due to finish radiotherapy, a member of her household was identified as a close contact. She had spent the week at Inala House, an accommodation service for cancer patients in Tamworth, but usually went home on the weekends. “I didn’t want to go home and risk not being able to finish my treatment,” she says. Inala House was able to provide weekend accommodation at short notice. “It’s just one less thing that you have to worry about, if you know that you have your accommodation,” she says. Philip Lipscombe spent most of the last two years in self-imposed lockdown, and now fears the isolation more than the virus. Christmas 2020 was the hardest. Sydney’s northern beaches, where Lipscombe lives, was locked down just before the holidays, so he had to spend it alone. “I sat at home here and pulled a chicken to bits on my own, and that was Christmas,” he says. “And I mean, there is no point to life unless it’s got a little bit of quality.” The 76-year-old has been living with pancreatic cancer for eight years. He was originally told he would be lucky to live a few months, after surgery to remove most of his pancreas and 18 rounds of chemotherapy. It was a long, hard battle, and left him with two lesions on the bottom of his lungs, a timebomb that will one day go off. So when the pandemic first struck he was very careful. He avoided the shops, relying on meals on wheels and local group Golden Days to deliver essentials, and spent hours in the garden trying to pass the time. “I don’t think there was a weed that was game enough to show its face in that period of time,” he says. “I was very lonely, though, for human contact, because the only contact I really had was by phone. Lipscombe now goes out two to three days a week with Easylink, a community organisation in the northern beaches which provides social outings and a medical shuttle service. On Wednesday they went for lunch at a football club, on Thursday they had a mystery picnic. He’s made friends on the buses, and the social outing is worth the risk of catching Omicron – all passengers are masked and triple-vaccinated, and most outings are outdoors. “I am a social person – I did 30 years on a post office counter talking to people every day,” he says. “I realised that I probably will get it – hopefully only a mild version probably, but my body, I’m in hopes, will be able to cope with that.” Lipscombe says he feels for those who have received a new diagnosis in the pandemic and are undergoing treatment without a loved one to hold their hand. He advises anyone who has been recently diagnosed to contact the Cancer Council about joining a support group. He has attended fortnightly support group sessions for pancreatic cancer for seven years. Calls to the Cancer Council’s support line increased in January, says Amanda Piper from Cancer Council Victoria. “We’re fortunate that we’ve got vaccinations in place for many people, and that’s an added layer of protection,” she says. “But people are fatigued. Cancer treatment takes a long time – people can sometimes undergo treatment for a year or more. It’s difficult to suggest that it’s that it’s worse now [than during lockdown] but it’s still hard. And people need support during this time.” If you need help, you can phone the Cancer Council support line on 13 11 20 or Lifeline on 13 11 14",News/Australia news,Delayed diagnoses and self-imposed lockdown: Australians living with cancer during Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/14/delayed-diagnoses-and-self-imposed-lockdown-australians-living-with-cancer-during-covid
2/14/2022,"Trekking into a walk-in campsite with a tent and provisions for fire-cooked meals on your back can definitely be a romantic experience. But if you’re after intimacy and seclusion that is a little less rugged, accommodation in scenic areas often escalates from under-the-stars to five stars, with not much in the middle. We’ve scoured the country for short stays and experiences that feel special but not extravagant, within a few hours of every capital city.  Where: Blackheath, 1 hour’s drive west of Sydney (2½ hours by train) What: The Kyah – which opened late in 2021 – has used a pastel palette and a restrained eye to transform an old motel into something far more stylish, retaining a twist of 70s nostalgia. In an area known for four-poster beds and lavish lace curtains, it’s sleeker and more affordable than many of the other big hotels around. The on-site restaurant Blaq sources mainly from producers within the region, an approach that extends to the wine and cocktail list. Blackheath also has a handful of excellent cafes and one fancy dinner spot (Ates) in town too. In the evening, go on an adventure to discover glow-worm colonies in the Blue Mountains’ sheltered canyons and gullies. For a few weeks a year, usually in late December, there are even courting fireflies around. Price: From $420 for a two-night stay in a King Room at The Kyah plus $14.95 for a downloadable Blue Mountains Glow Worm and Firefly Discovery Guidebook. Where: Huon Valley, just over an hour’s drive south of Hobart What: Ten minutes drive from Cygnet and Huonville, a restored 1975 Kombi called Frida offers a taste of van life, without the commitment. Parked beside a pretty creek, the owners will decorate it to a theme of your choosing – all varying shades of hippy – upon request. The farm has several private waterholes for warmer weather (though diving into bodies of freezing water is a Tasmanian tradition), and there’s also a hot outdoor shower. There’s an extensive outdoor set-up including a deck, fire pit, and a kitchen with a potbelly stove, with a cook-it-yourself breakfast also provided. Price: $497 for a two-night stay at Kombi Kamp. Where: Aldgate, half an hour’s drive southeast of Adelaide What: Surrounded by tall trees, Cladich Pavillons’ three glass and corrugated steel rooms strike a balance between big windows and a sense of privacy. They’re right in the middle of an excellent wine region, too. For big estate tastings try Sidewood and Shaw and Smith, while experimental, natural drops from smaller producers can be found at Summertown Aristologist. Meanwhile, Applewood distills craft spirits, and the McLaren Vale is off to the south. If your idea of romance runs more toward chocolate boxes than wine, then the early German settlement of Hahndorf is just 11 minutes down the road. The area has several farmers markets too. Price: Approximately $480 for a two-night stay at Cladich Pavilions. Where: Coolangatta, 1 ¼ hour’s drive from Brisbane (under 2 hours by public transport) What: Get your kitsch kicks on behind the white sands of Coolangatta Beach at a hotel that looks like a Wes Anderson film on the outside and an episode of the Real World: Miami inside, complete with an Astroturfed rooftop bar. Nearby, Eddie’s Grub House has repeatedly picked up nods for having the Gold Coast’s best burgers despite not technically being on the Gold Coast. Within a short stroll, both Kirra Lookout and Point Danger offer that east coast rarity: sublime sunrise and sunset views over the water. Check out hidden Froggy Beach wedged between Snapper Rocks and Point Danger and take a surf lesson together with a mate at Greenmount Beach. Price: From $268 for a two-night stay in a King Room at the Pink Hotel, which leaves plenty of budget for $55 beginner surf lessons plus burgers and drinks. Where: Yellow Water Billabong, three hours’ drive west of Darwin What: Kakadu National Park may sound like a big-ticket trip, but during the Wet season prices drop significantly, making it more feasible for a quick escape. In a couple of days, you can swoon over the birdlife on Kakadu’s Yellow Water billabong cruise and cool off at Maguk, Motor Car or Moline falls. Savour colour-saturated sunset vistas over the flood plains at Nawurlandja lookout and admire the Burrungkuy (Nourlangie) rock art site before sultry nights in your glamping tent (don’t worry, it has ceiling fans and air conditioning) at Cooinda Lodge’s outback retreat. Conditions change quickly during the Wet, so always check park websites and local signage for closures. Price: From $358 for a two-night stay at Cooinda Lodge’s Outback Retreat and $164 for a 1.5-hour Yellow Water cruise for two. Note that prices can more than double during the high season (June through October). Where: Yarrangobilly, 2¾ hours’ drive southwest of Canberra What: Discover the surprisingly romantic stalagmites, stalactites and other delicate decorations of the Yarrangobilly Caves in Northern Kosciuszko National Park. The gigantic South Glory Cave is magical, with light streaming through a hole in the top. Dress warmly to explore the caves, but bring swimsuits to soak in the warm-but-not-hot thermal pool. The rugged karst landscape offers great wildlife and bird watching, and the beautifully restored 1917 heritage Yarrangobilly Caves House makes an ideal base. Price: $317 for a two-night stay in a Queen Room at the self-catering Caves House. Cave tour prices vary from $22-$38 per person. Jersey and Jillabenan Caves are currently closed due to flooding. The free thermal pool is closed until 9 April due to maintenance works on the track. Where: Avenel, 1½ hours’ drive from Melbourne (and the same by train) What: The affordable French provincial inn offering food that warms your soul, comfortable beds and big gulps of country air is a rarity in Australia. But the two-storey, slightly bohemian Harvest Home hotel fits the bill, with six character-filled rooms, complimentary breakfast, a pretty garden, a swimming pool, and an open fireplace when the weather turns chilly. Enjoy the likes of goat’s cheese tarts, risotto primavera and mouth-watering eye fillet with a thoughtful selection of central Victorian wines on the terrace, veranda or inside. Check out the Ladies Who Shoot their Lunch range of wines at nearby Fowles Wine. Price: Starts at $398 for a two-night stay with full breakfast at Harvest Home. Mains at the restaurant are priced around $30. Where: Yallingup, 2¾ hours’ drive south of Perth What: The romantic jackpot: a serene, secluded studio cottage with a large bath, wood-burning stove, and glorious vistas. It’s just five minutes’ drive to the surf at Smith’s Beach and just a little longer to the dreamy aquamarine waters of Bunker Bay, while the entire smörgåsbord of Margaret River wineries is laid out to the south. At the end of the day, watch surfers and dolphin on the famous Yallingup surf break as the sun sets over the Indian Ocean. Price: Approximately $460 for a two-night stay in the Honeybee Cottage at Wildwood Valley Cottages.",Lifestyle/Travel,Cellar doors and sunsets: romantic Australian mini-breaks under $500,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/feb/14/cellar-doors-and-sunsets-romantic-australian-mini-breaks-under-500
2/14/2022,"“The Valentine’s Day ads are driving me crazy,” my mother tells me an hour into our phone conversation a week before 14 February. It’s the kind of impromptu, rollicking chat you can only have when neither of you are in a rush because neither of you have a partner waiting for you to go to bed. My mother has more right than I do to be sensitive about the subject. We both became single in 2021. She lost her partner of 33 years to illness; my relationship ended after a little over a year.  What bound us together tighter last year was the grief we felt as we mourned no longer having that romantic love in our life. For three years my mother cared 24 hours a day, seven days a week for my father, with increasing difficulty as vascular dementia took hold of his capabilities, his muscles losing their memory. I thought it was duty that bound her to do so. It was only in the last week of my father’s life that I understood it was love. That last week was the clearest I ever saw the depth of the love between them. As he entered a coma, the palliative care team told us that hearing was the last sense to go. With no acknowledgement of whether he could hear her, she spent the entire night before he died telling him every 10 minutes she loved him. In the subsequent months, as we spent more time together, my mother and I returned endlessly to discussions of what constitutes true love in a romantic partnership, its different iterations and the choices people make. In its absence in our own lives, we are left to marvel at how powerful a source it is not only of happiness but, ultimately, identity. But at the same time the year that passed was also a testament to the necessity of having love outside the romantic sphere – diversifying your love portfolio. Without my dad, my mum needed my love and that of my sister, my mum’s friends and our extended family, all the more. When my relationship ended, the same was true for me. Another friend reflected to me, after they broke up with their long-term partner, that they realised how much of their own self-worth they’d hung upon that single hook of being in a relationship. And, bearing all that weight, the fall is all the more shattering. Valentine’s Day as a commercial enterprise has homed in on a celebration of romantic love, to the exclusion of love’s other guises. This commercialisation can trick you into thinking that just because you don’t have romantic love in your life, you don’t have love at all. I like to think back to the day in lockdown when my mother and I rode our bikes to La Perouse in Sydney’s east. It was a Sunday, which I would have spent with my boyfriend had we not broken up the week before. Lockdown seemed a time that couples were more ubiquitous than ever, with no opportunities for group outings and the rules favouring visits with “intimate partners”. La Perouse was full of couples – elderly couples, couples with young kids, couples who could have been on a first date. But I was lucky to be part of my own couple, sitting on the sand and enjoying watching the waves with my mum, whom I love very much. The part I remember most in Virginia Woolf’s novel Orlando is when Orlando is among Gypsies: One evening, when they were all sitting round the camp fire and the sunset was blazing over the Thessalian hills, Orlando exclaimed: ‘How good to eat!’ (The gipsies have no word for ‘beautiful’. This is the nearest.) All the young men and women burst out laughing uproariously. The narrator explains: It is a curious fact that though human beings have such imperfect means of communication, that they can only say ‘good to eat’ when they mean ‘beautiful’ and the other way about, they will yet endure ridicule and misunderstanding rather than keep any experience to themselves. I like this passage because it resonates with my experience that being lonely isn’t an inevitability of finding yourself alone. The times I have felt the loneliest have been a visit to an art gallery, where I might see a really beautiful painting; or when I read something I know someone I love would find particularly funny, and think to myself: “I wish they were here with me.” I think back to those moments to remind myself to always be grateful for whatever love – whether it’s romantic or maternal or the love of an animal – that shows up in your life to share it with you.",Opinion/Opinion,Single on Valentine’s Day?

2/14/2022,"The event’s lineup was formidable and the audience at the 2021 Sydney writers’ festival was expectant: Cathy McGowan, Annabel Crabb, Kate Ellis and Mehreen Faruqi in a discussion on “women in politics” chaired by Clare Wright. It was a lively session, if also depressing, traversing the discrimination Faruqi and Ellis faced from opponents in the parliament, and in Kate’s case, from within her own party. Faruqi described how difficult she found it to even enter Parliament House since it had been revealed as a house of harassment, bullying and assault. She told the audience that, despite her previous career in the highly masculine profession of engineering, she had “never felt more marginalised and sidelined” than as a politician. For Faruqi, as a migrant brown woman, the parliament was a “very lonely place”.  Ellis described the “unspoken code of not acknowledging the sexist and unfair treatment that has long bubbled away in the background of parliament”. She told the shocking story of a Liberal staffer, now a member of parliament, introducing himself by asking how many men she had fucked to get elected. Steeped in the post-production of her immensely enjoyable series Ms Represented, Crabb provided a historical perspective on women’s quest for electoral representation. But it was McGowan who stole the show with her rallying cry for more women to get involved in politics as independents, to follow in the footsteps of Zali Steggall, Rebekha Sharkie, Kerryn Phelps, Helen Haines and McGowan herself – to accept their voice, grasp their collective power, and get out there with courage and capacity to “do the work that needs to be done for the country”. She advocated for a strong, independent and female crossbench. “It can be done,” she said, exhorting the overwhelmingly female audience at Carriageworks to share her vision of an Australia whose citizenry, rejecting the status quo, got themselves elected to parliament to change it. She believed it possible. She had done it. “This could change things overnight,” she said emphatically, gesturing at the despicable anecdotes that hung in the air. “For too long, we have underplayed the power of our vote. We haven’t been strategic.” She challenged the audience to be brave, “to be the change you want to see”. If we do, she assured us, we can have “women of quality and courage and capacity and principle holding the balance of power”. Politics is a numbers game, she said, and we needed to be deliberate and strategic and go out and get those damn numbers. It was inspiring stuff from McGowan, delivered in a brisk, firm way, accompanied by invitations to get involved, to attend workshops coordinated by Women for Election Australia. Community-based politics runs somewhat in McGowan’s family, with her sister Ruth a principal in the Women for Election organisation, and her brother-in-law Denis Ginnivan, niece Leah Ginnivan and nephew Ben McGowan all instrumental in her first campaign for Indi. Denis subsequently founded Voices for AU, which seeks to inspire grassroots involvement in democracy across the nation, and he travels the country tirelessly, through Covid lockdowns by Zoom and now in person, to share his experience of the success of the Indi campaign, offering it up as a model for people to get involved in their community and consider backing – or being – candidates for election. The story of McGowan’s success in Indi is well known. After frustration at the neglect of the seat by the unlikeable incumbent Sophie Mirabella, in September 2012 a group of locals formed the community organisation Voices for Indi. Supported by Melbourne-based group Indi Expats, they created a community-focused strategy to shake things up, with the aim of turning Indi into a marginal seat at the September 2013 election. With a commitment to ensuring Indi’s “electoral voice is heard and represented at the national level”, they developed what became known as Kitchen Table Conversations. Interested individuals were trained to facilitate discussion between small groups in their networks, serving both to provide Voices for Indi with insight into the issues important to locals, and to seed the idea of the community supporting a grassroots independent candidate at the next election. Initially reluctant to stand herself, after urging from others, McGowan accepted she would be a competitive contender and “began the process of reconciling [her]self to six months of campaigning”. Although the initial objective had merely been to shock the Liberal party out of complacency by dramatically reducing its margin, McGowan invested all that she could on the campaign trail and was rewarded by the narrowest of victories 11 days after election night, when final prepoll and postal votes were counted. Against the odds, McGowan had defeated Mirabella by 439 votes and was going to Canberra. At Al Gore’s Asia-Pacific training for climate change advocacy, organisers promoted the idea of “lighthouse projects”. Said one attendee, Jane, who went on to work on Zali Steggall’s 2019 campaign, “It is something new that then acts as a lighthouse for everyone else. There is something that is now possible that wasn’t possible before.” McGowan’s victories in 2013 and 2016 became lighthouse projects for other electorates and community-based independents disgusted by the state of federal politics, particularly those frightened or ashamed of our inaction on the existential question of climate change. They inspired Kerryn Phelps to run as an independent in the Wentworth byelection in October 2018 triggered by the resignation of Malcolm Turnbull after his ousting from the prime ministership. Phelps’s strong victory saw a swing of 20% against the government, giving her 57% of the two-party-preferred vote, and it marked the first time in the seat’s 117-year history that it had been surrendered by the Liberal party. It forced Morrison into minority government, with six crossbenchers holding the balance of power. With the exception of long-term maverick conservative Bob Katter, the parliament’s crossbenchers rallied to support Phelps’s first foray into the legislative arena, the migration amendment (urgent medical treatment) bill 2018, the so-called medevac bill that provided critically sick refugees and people seeking asylum who were held in offshore detention with a pathway to be transferred to Australia for urgent medical treatment. Phelps worked on the bill with McGowan and Rebekha Sharkie of the Centre Alliance, the remnant of the Nick Xenophon Team that had also delivered Stirling Griff and now independents Rex Patrick and Tim Storer to the Senate – albeit in a convoluted way after Xenophon’s resignation from running for the South Australian parliament in October 2017, and Skye Kakoschke-Moore’s forced resignation in November 2017 after falling foul of the dual citizen crisis that engulfed federal parliament. Liberal defector and now independent Julia Banks was also an important supporter of the bill following her resignation from the Liberal party in November 2018 in the aftermath of the coup against Turnbull. With Andrew Wilkie, the Greens’ Adam Bandt and the Labor party also on board, Phelps succeeded in passing amendments to a government migration bill, the first time a government had lost a vote on its own legislation in almost 80 years. It was also the first positive measure taken in the field of refugee law since the early days of Rudd’s administration. Morrison was apoplectic and the government immediately sought to gain political mileage from the bill’s passage. “Australia is back on the map for people smugglers,” said Peter Dutton on 7.30. As a result of the bill, he said, there are people in detention “that can come to our country from Manus or Nauru. People that have been charged with child sex offences or have allegations around serious offences including murder.” When pressed by host Leigh Sales as to how many people in offshore detention were accused or suspected of such crimes, Dutton refused to answer. The passage of the amendments was a clear demonstration of the impact a committed and cohesive crossbench could have. While they could not form government, they showed that they could influence the national and legislative agenda. They could get things done. The euphoria was short-lived. At the 2019 election, Kerryn Phelps narrowly lost her seat to Dave Sharma, a former ambassador to Israel who had run again after losing to Phelps at the byelection. It was a blow to the independents’ movement. Standing as an independent in Flinders against Greg Hunt, Julia Banks also failed in her bid to return to parliament. On the plus side, McGowan, after serving the two terms to which she’d earlier committed, had retired and been replaced by Helen Haines, marking the first time that a seat had passed from one independent to another. Haines was joined on the crossbench by impressive newcomer Zali Steggall, the Abbott slayer, but the independents no longer held the balance of power. The government repealed the medevac bill on 4 December 2019 after securing the support of independent senator Jacqui Lambie in a secret deal, the terms of which remain unknown to this day beyond the fact that the government has failed to deliver on them. Initially, each of the successful independent candidates elected in this new modern era also had a rallying local issue on which to campaign. Cathy McGowan ran strongly on the idea that Indi had been neglected by a complacent Liberal party. She campaigned on the need for greater investment in infrastructure in the rural Victorian seat, particularly around the lack of rail services and track maintenance, and poor internet connections and mobile phone coverage. The personal unpopularity of Mirabella, who was nominated by Tony Windsor for the “nasty prize” as the person he’d miss least in politics, was also considered a factor in her defeat. Kerryn Phelps’s byelection victory was a protest vote against the deposing of Turnbull, while her loss at the general election reflected the abatement of the electorate’s fury. An articulate barrister and former Olympian, Zali Steggall may have been a candidate from Central Casting, but people in Warringah also voted for her because of who she was not – namely Tony Abbott, considered by many of his constituents to hold embarrassing and unrepresentative antediluvian views, and, as a failed prime minister, to have outstayed his welcome in the seat. Now, as disillusionment with the Morrison government grows in Coalition-held seats across the country, a new generation of independents is emerging. These candidates are typically newcomers to political activism and never anticipated they would be involved in electoral politics. “I had no intention of entering politics until I was approached by Voices,” said Zoe Daniel, former ABC foreign correspondent and independent candidate for the seat of Goldstein, whose declaration and launch event on the weekend of 27 November 2021 was greeted with a wild enthusiasm that sent sitting member Tim Wilson into a blind panic. “It’s time to step up to the table,” said Daniel. Allegra Spender, a businesswoman and daughter of Liberal party scion John Spender and the late fashion icon Carla Zampatti, announced her candidacy in Wentworth on the same weekend. Other candidates who had already declared included businesswoman Kylea Tink in North Sydney, architect Linda Reynolds in Hughes and former teacher Penny Ackery in Hume. I have announced my own candidacy for the South Australian seat of Boothby. Rather than running specifically on local issues, this new set of candidates is running against the system itself, a system that delivered all the dispiriting, defining moments of the pandemic explored earlier. Our failure to grapple with climate change. The lack of integrity in politics. The loss of our moral compass on refugees. Our criminal complacency around gendered violence and inequity. Ackery’s opponent in Hume is the perennially unpopular scandal magnet and fossil fuel enthusiast Angus Taylor, who holds his seat by a margin of 13%. “Can we win?” says Ackery, contemplating the challenge. “We can win because there’s a wonderful growing independents movement that has paved the way, so that we know how to act, and what things need to be done.” So far, the tactics of the so-called moderate Liberals have been to paint these fiercely independent and mostly formerly apolitical women as Labor or Green stooges. Tim Wilson described Daniel as a “puppet whose strings they’re yanking to dance to their Labor and Greens tune”, someone who was “backed by Big Tech climate activists who want to rig laws so they can increase their profits from higher energy costs to businesses and households”. While stating he respected everyone’s right to run, Angus Taylor said the independents’ movement was “just another front for green activists to play dress up as independents”. Dismissing these centrist candidates, many of whom would have sat comfortably in the previously broad church of the Liberal party, as radical activists or stooges seems a risky tactic. Speaking at her campaign launch in Wentworth, where she was introduced by chair of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and former Reserve Bank director Jillian Broadbent, Allegra Spender noted: “Today’s Liberal party is not the same party as that of my father and grandfather.” She called out the attempts to undermine her independent credentials: “Wentworth is not radical and I am not a radical at all. But there are those who are trying to paint me and this wave of independents as such.” They do so at their peril.
