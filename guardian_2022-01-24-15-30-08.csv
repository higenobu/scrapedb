1/24/2022,"The European Council has removed Australia from the “white list”, a register of countries from which it recommends travel restrictions should be lifted. The council’s list of epidemiologically-safe third countries is non-binding and countries within the European Union are able to set their own border requirements, which may involve quarantine or testing requirements.  The European Council said on 17 January it had updated its list of countries for which travel restrictions should be lifted, and removed Argentina, Australia and Canada. The decision is non-binding on European Union member states and reviewed every two weeks. Under the criteria used by the European Council, all restrictions on travellers from a third country can be lifted if the rate of Covid-19 infections in the past 14 days is less than 75 in 100,000. The criteria also states that if countries accept proof of vaccination to waive travel restrictions such as testing or quarantine requirements, they should in principle lift restrictions on travel for all double-dosed international travellers. This decision to remove Australia from the list was made in the 14 days in which Australia’s daily Covid numbers shot up from 30,000 to more than 100,000. In the past week, Australia has averaged 274 cases per 100,000, a 20% drop on the previous seven days. The European Council criteria also includes an “emergency brake mechanism”. It states: “Where the epidemiological situation of a third country or region worsens quickly, in particular if a variant of concern or of interest has been detected, member states should adopt an urgent, temporary restriction on all travel into the EU”. At the moment, the list of countries for which European countries are recommended to allow not-restricted travel is: Bahrain, Chile, Colombia, Indonesia, Kuwait, New Zealand, Peru, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, United Arab Emirates, Uruguay, and China, subject to confirmation of reciprocity. The chief executive of Flight Centre, Graham Turner, says the removal of Australia from the EU white list will have “minimal effect on vaccinated Australians travelling to Europe”. “Each EU country has their own protocols and if you are vaccinated most do not require pre-departure testing and isolation at arrival,” he said. “I believe the indications are that within three to six weeks Australians will be able to fly to North America and UK/Europe without pre-departure tests and tourists will be able to fly here under the same conditions.” Cyprus, Greece and Italy have already said they will not restrict travellers from Australia. Germany, meanwhile, has listed Australia as a high-risk area since 9 January, but quarantine-free travel is still allowed for fully-vaccinated Australians who test negative after arrival. No. The United Kingdom is currently open to quarantine-free travel from all countries. If you are fully vaccinated with an approved vaccine and have a vaccine certificate, you are required to book and pay for a Covid-19 test before getting on your flight to be taken within 48 hours of your arrival in the UK. If you test positive you will be required to isolate but there are no separate quarantine requirements. If you are not fully vaccinated you must take a Covid-19 test within two days before travelling to the UK, and then book and pay for PCR tests to be taken on day 2 and 8 after your arrival. There is still no requirement to quarantine.",News/Australia news,What does Australia’s removal from the European Council’s travel ‘white list’ mean?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/24/what-does-australias-removal-from-the-european-councils-travel-white-list-mean
1/24/2022,"China’s air force flew 39 warplanes into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone on Sunday, the largest daily number since record-breaking incursions in October. Taiwan’s Ministry of Defence said it had tasked aircraft in response, issued radio warnings to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) pilots and deployed missile defence systems to monitor the activity.  In recent years the PLA has ratcheted up its incursions, which it says are training drills, to near daily frequency. Over four days in October nearly 150 planes were dispatched, breaking previous records and coinciding with China’s National Day, a key patriotic holiday. Sunday’s sorties into the Taiwan Strait included 34 fighter jets, one bomber, two electronic warfare planes and two intelligence-gathering planes. They flew near the disputed Pratas Islands and close to the edge of the median line, an unofficial border of set length through the Strait between Taiwan’s main island and China. Longstanding tacit agreement over the marker appeared to be thrown out by China in 2020, when a foreign ministry spokesperson said there was no such thing. No Chinese missions crossed the line between its declaration by US military figures in 1955 and 1999, and remained rare in the years after. In September 2020 Taiwan accused China of flying dozens of planes across the line after a visit by senior US official Keith Krach. On Sunday the Financial Times reported China had established a permanent presence of at least one warship in the waters between Japan’s southern islands and Taiwan for the last six months, the first time it has done so on the eastern side of the islands between it and the Pacific. Beijing considers Taiwan to be a province of China, and has not ruled out taking it by force. The PLA flights into the Strait are grey-zone tactics – war-adjacent strategies which do not meet the threshold of combat – which are thought to be designed to intimidate Taiwan and wear out its military by forcing constant responses. Taiwan, which is a self-governing democracy with open elections and free press, maintains it is a sovereign nation. In response to Beijing’s threats it is strengthening its military with assistance and weapons purchases from the US, but faces challenges. Earlier this month it suspended combat training for its F-16 fleet after a recently upgraded model of the plane crashed into the sea, presumably killing the pilot, whose body has not been found. The Chinese planes did not fly into Taiwan’s sovereign airspace on Sunday, which would represent a significant hostile act. The ADIZ is a self-declared airspace which Taiwan’s government monitors for defence purposes. China’s military did not give a reason for the missions on Sunday, but it came days after a US warship conducted a freedom of navigation exercise near the disputed Paracel Islands. US and Japanese naval forces were also conducting exercises in the Philippines Sea over the weekend, which the US Pacific Fleet said included two carrier strike groups “conducting training to preserve and protect a free and open Indo Pacific”.",News/World news,China sends largest incursion of warplanes into Taiwan defence zone since October,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/24/china-sends-largest-incursion-of-warplanes-into-taiwan-defence-zone-since-october
1/24/2022,"Tennis great Martina Navratilova has condemned as “pathetic” the Australian Open’s decision to stop fans wearing ‘Where is Peng Shuai?’ T-shirts, accusing Tennis Australia of “capitulating” to China. Late last week spectators at Melbourne Park were asked to remove their T-shirts and security confiscated a banner emblazoned with the same words, on the grounds that TA prohibits “clothing, banners or signs that are commercial or political”.  The governing body stood by its rationale on Sunday and stated Peng’s “safety is our primary concern” and continued to work with the Women’s Tennis Association to “seek more clarity” on the Chinese star’s wellbeing almost three months after she accused a senior Chinese official of sexual assault and then virtually disappeared from public life. But Navratilova, the retired Czech who won 18 grand slam singles titles, said she found it difficult to believe. “That’s just pathetic,” Navratilova tweeted. “The @wta stands pretty much alone on this.” She then appeared on the Tennis Channel alongside Lindsay Davenport and spoke more expansively on the issue. “Sport has always been on the forefront of social issues, pushing them forward, and we are going backwards I feel … I find it really, really cowardly,” she said. “This is not a political statement, this is a human rights statement. And chances are Peng Shuai may be playing here but, she couldn’t get out of the country? Anyway, I think they’re wrong on this. “The WTA has been so strong on this issue … and the players, really taking a chance on their pocket book. The ATP was pretty weak on this. The IOC, well we know where they are. And just really capitulating on this issue from the Aussies, letting China dictate what they do at their own slam.” Peng has only been sighted a handful of times on Chinese social media since early November when her post on Weibo, in which she accused the former vice-premier Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault, was quickly deleted from China’s heavily censored internet. In late December, Peng retracted her allegations in an interview with Singapore media outlet Lianhe Zaobao, a Chinese-language publication under the state-controlled Singapore Press Holdings Limited. “First, I need to stress one point that is extremely important, I have never said or written that anyone has sexually assaulted me, I have to clearly stress this point,” Peng said in the video posted by Lianhe Zaobao. She said her deleted Weibo post was a “private matter”. Davenport, the American former world No 1, described the situation as “absolutely heartbreaking”. “The WTA used so much good, strong language when this first went down, and unfortunately this story just seems to … be quiet, just push it in the back,” she said. “People in tennis, we want to see her. She was a real part of this tour. But most importantly we want to know she’s OK.” Numerous players at the Australian Open have spoken of their concern for Peng’s safety, and Frenchman Nicolas Mahut tweeted about the incident at Melbourne Park. “What’s going on!? What lack of courage! What if you did not have Chinese sponsors?” Mahut tweeted. A fundraising page to raise money to print more ‘Where is Peng Shuai?’ T-shirts to be handed out for free during the women’s final has reached more than $12,000 in two days.

1/24/2022,"A legal challenge over a decision to ban media organisations from a court case about the Duke of Edinburgh’s will is to be heard by the court of appeal. The Guardian has been given permission by a court of appeal judge to bring the challenge against the attorney general and the Queen’s private lawyers.  Its legal action has been brought after the president of the family division of the high court, Sir Andrew McFarlane, ruled last September that the will of Prince Philip should be hidden from the public for 90 years. It followed a private hearing that media organisations were not told about and were consequently prevented from attending. The Guardian intends to argue that the case should be reheard in the high court because McFarlane failed to properly consider whether reporters should have been permitted to attend the original hearing, or make representations in favour of being allowed to attend. The paper argues that this was a serious interference with the principle of open justice. Lady Justice King, a court of appeal judge, gave permission, stating that: “There is a real prospect of the applicant [the Guardian] succeeding on the ground that the high court erred in law in denying the media an opportunity to make submissions, or at least to attend and hear submissions, as to whether the substantive application to seal the will of His Late Royal Highness, the Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh should be heard in private.” Judges only grant permission for a case to be heard in the court of appeal if they believe there is real possibility of winning or if there is some other compelling reason. At this stage, they are not making any decision on the ultimate outcome. The legal challenge will focus attention on the secrecy that surrounds an obscure exemption that has been granted to the royal family. Wills made by members of the Windsor family are kept secret, in contrast to ordinary members of the public. British law dictates that wills drawn up by members of the public are ordinarily made public after they die. Wills are published in order to ensure that they are correctly implemented, prevent fraud and alert all those who may benefit. Since 1910, the wills of more than 30 members of the royal family – including distant relatives – have been concealed after legal applications. The high court granted these applications in private hearings. A list of the wills that have been kept secret for more than a century are kept in a locked safe in the high court. In November, in a move towards transparency, McFarlane decided to publish the list of those royals whose wills have been sealed, although the contents of the wills are still concealed. In September, McFarlane ruled that Philip’s will should be kept secret, adding: “The answer to the question ‘why should there be an exception for senior members of the royal family?’ is, in my view, clear: it is necessary to enhance the protection afforded to the private lives of this unique group of individuals, in order to protect the dignity and standing of the public role of the sovereign and other close members of her family.” “While there may be public curiosity as to the private arrangements that a member of the royal family may choose to make in their will, there is no true public interest in the public knowing this wholly private information … The media interest in this respect is commercial.” He made the ruling after a hearing at which only Philip’s executor, Farrer and Co Trust Corporation, a subsidiary of the Queen’s private solicitors Farrer and Co, and the acting attorney general, Michael Ellis, were permitted to attend. Both parties successfully persuaded the judge to exclude the media from the hearing. McFarlane said he “accepted the argument that only the attorney general can speak, as a matter of public law, to the public interest, and that there was, legally, therefore no role for those who might represent the media at a hearing (public or private) in putting forward any contrary view of the public interest”.",News/UK news,Court of appeal to hear challenge over media ban from Prince Philip’s will court case,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/22/court-of-appeal-to-hear-challenge-over-media-ban-from-prince-philips-will-court-case
1/24/2022,"A former Young Liberal, Alex Dore, nephew of the Australian’s editor in chief, Chris Dore, is set to be springboarded into the federal seat of Hughes under a complex factional deal to avoid contentious NSW Liberal preselections. The backroom deal – if it sticks – will bypass plebiscites in several seats. New rules introduced in 2018 – the Warringah rules, championed by former prime minister Tony Abbott – were designed to give more say to local members.  But as the federal election looms, preselections have been delayed by factional manoeuvring and the failure of the committee that vets potential candidates to meet, even though nominations closed last May. There is now white-hot anger among some Liberal members about the manoeuvring and the attempts to sidestep the Warringah rules. “We criticise the Labor party for using their N40 rules to choose candidates, but we are no better. We might even be worse,” said one senior Liberal. The deal, hammered out by factional negotiators on Saturday, involves avoiding rank and file votes in all seats held by federal MPs who were facing challenges. It also springboards candidates into several winnable seats, including Dobell and Hughes. But the deal still has to be put to state executive council on Friday and requires 90% support by the 27-strong state executive to pass. Among the right faction, there is particular anger at the negotiations, which included Charles Perrottet, the brother of the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, and Dallas McInerney, the chief executive of Catholic Schools. Some said the deal had no chance of passing at state executive council this Friday and was instead a further ploy by factional leaders to engineer a crisis within the NSW Liberal party that would prompt federal intervention on the grounds of urgency. The federal election must be held by May and NSW Liberals are still to choose candidates in several key seats. Others pointed to the fact that the negotiators had perceived conflicts of interest because their seats were under threat. Several sitting MPs are facing preselection challenges and, after a surprise result in the state seat of Willoughby where a rightwinger won the moderate-held seat, those concerns have become sharper. Trent Zimmerman, MP for North Sydney, and a moderate faction leader; environment minister, Sussan Ley, who holds Farrer; and immigration minister, Alex Hawke, the convener of the centre right faction who holds Mitchell; will be confirmed as the Liberal candidates under the deal. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The foreign minister, Marise Payne, will be confirmed as top of the NSW Liberal Senate ticket. The second spot is a Nationals spot. The third spot, however, will go to a vote, which could see senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells challenged by Senator Jim Molan, who filled a Senate vacancy. The deal would mean seats like Hughes will again not get to choose a candidate. Under the rules, Dore, who is said to have the backing of broadcaster Alan Jones would be anointed to fill the vacancy created by the current MP for Hughes, Craig Kelly, who became an independent after being reprimanded for spruiking unproven Covid -19 treatments. Kelly himself had been saved twice in the past from a challenge by prime ministerial interventions when he was the Liberal candidate. This means that in Hughes there will not have been an opportunity for locals to have a say for almost a decade. But within hours of the deal, there were already doubts about the Hughes component because Dore, who hails from the northern beaches, had not nominated for Hughes while three high profile local Liberals had. In the Central Coast seat of Dobell, the plan is to anoint Jemima Gleeson, a pentecostal preacher, who is backed by the centre right and Morrison over the right’s preferred candidate, Dr Michael Feneley. Under the deal, votes under the Warringah rules will go ahead in Bennelong, Warringah and Parramatta. However, the outcomes in each of these contests are said to be more certain. But whether the deal will be accepted is far from certain. Senior party figures have warned that the attempt to avoid the new rules will cause havoc in the party, particularly among the right, and result in the Liberals being unable to man polling booths with local Liberal members.",News/Australia news,Fury at backroom deal to usher former Young Liberal into federal seat of Hughes ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/24/fury-at-backroom-deal-to-usher-former-young-liberal-into-federal-seat-of-hughes
1/24/2022,"By the time the rising sun breaks through the morning mist over the Mongla River, the rhythmic chug of motors strapped to wooden canoes is already audible as thousands of workers are hurriedly ferried across the waterway. They jump on to the small landing dock, pick up a potato-stuffed shingara pastry for pennies and rush towards the factories in Mongla’s export processing zone (EPZ), which has transformed the small town into an employment hub in a part of Bangladesh ravaged by the climate crisis.  About 30 miles (50km) inland from the Bay of Bengal, Mongla is the gateway to the Unesco-listed Sundarbans mangrove forest, home to the endangered Bengal tiger. Its port, founded in the 1950s, has been the focus of an ambitious, decade-long project led by one of the world’s leading climate scientists to transform it into a town that actively welcomes climate refugees. “In my 30 years here I’ve seen so many changes. The roads, the docks, the number of people coming here. It has all changed,” says Abdul Jalil, a 52-year-old boatman on the Mongla River. “We used to have a lot of problems; after rains the roads would be flooded, we had very little infrastructure around here.” He used to row manually but says all the boats have motors now, with each carrying about 700 people a day across the river, on their way to work in the export zone or in Sundarbans tourism. “These people crossing, they’re all from other places, from the villages near the Sundarbans. They work here in the EPZ, for tourism in the Sundarbans, instead of going to places like Chittagong. It’s safer here, there isn’t crime, there are jobs and the living standards are better.” Bangladesh is an internal migration pressure cooker. There is nothing new in the country’s rural poor moving to cities in search of work. But catastrophic weather events are speeding up the waves of people flowing into the urban centres. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 4.1 million people (2.5% of the population) were displaced in Bangladesh as a result of climate-induced disasters as of 2019. A recent World Bank report predicted that the country will have 19.9 million internal climate refugees by 2050, almost half the projected number for the entire south Asia region. Most of those forced to leave their homes head to the capital, Dhaka, one of the fastest growing megacities in the world and among the least liveable. Home to 20 million people, over a third of whom live in slums lacking even the most basic infrastructure, the city is dangerously overcrowded. Against this grim backdrop of daily struggles and looming catastrophe, Prof Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD), has formulated a vision of “transformative adaptation” to alleviate pressure on Dhaka and its conurbations. It aims to divert people to smaller urban centres with the capacity to expand and, crucially, jobs to sustain a rapidly growing workforce. “The phenomenon of migration is age old – there’s nothing new here – but climate change is causing people to move and we are having to deal with this very, very quickly – that is what made us work on the idea,” says Huq. More than a dozen satellite cities and towns, all adjacent to economic hubs such as sea and river ports or export processing zones, have been identified as potential migrant-friendly locations. “They are all secondary towns with populations of between a few hundred thousand and half a million which can absorb up to half a million climate migrants each,” says Huq. Among those towns, Mongla stood out for the progress it had already made on climate breakdown mitigation, driven by the town’s dynamic mayor, Zulfikar Ali. In his 10 years in office, from 2011 to 2021, an array of infrastructural developments made Mongla a safer, more resilient town. They include a 7-mile raised embankment along newly built Marine Drive designed to protect against flooding; two flood-control gates; an improved drainage system; two 40 hectare (100 acre) reservoirs and a fresh water treatment plant that has increased the proportion of houses with running water from a third to a half. Sheikh Abdur Rahman, who took over from Ali as mayor of Mongla in January 2021, has picked up the baton. “At one time the city was regularly flooded by high tides. Now it is being brought under climate-friendly city planning,” he says. A public address system was installed to announce changes in weather to the community. The town’s proximity to the second largest port in Bangladesh and an export processing zone that already employs 8,000 people also made it economically attractive, says Huq. “The primary carrot [in luring people to a town] is jobs,” he says. “But that’s the easy part.” The challenge, he says, is the “softer interventions”, the social and cultural changes required to bring about his vision of a network of towns whose existing residents welcome newcomers. “Hostility between host and migrant happens everywhere,” says Huq. “In Bangladesh, we have several big advantages – one is that we look the same so migrants are not distinguishable; second, there is one language – we all speak Bangla; and third, we all have the same religion. What we do have is a class barrier, so the newcomer is a poor person eking out a living – and that is what we are working on, humanising what is initially seen as ‘other’.” These softer interventions include making sure the children of migrants are well integrated in schools and encouraging them to go on to university to break the cycle of poverty. These may be relatively modest aims on paper but they require buy-in from educational institutions. Huq and his team have spent time talking to schools and universities to gain their support for the concept. Mongla’s population was below 40,000 in the 2011 census but a decade later three times as many people are thought to be living there. Huq’s mission to actively encourage migration to the town is likely to swell that figure by tens, possibly hundreds of thousands more. Mongla is the first town to adopt ICCCAD’s recommendations, but others will follow. “This is a 10-year action programme and we are taking it town by town, mayor by mayor,” says Huq. Over time, towns will set up outposts in the coastal areas and villages where the majority of climate migrants come from. Huq envisages these outposts as mini embassies that will act as information hubs for migrants, steering them away from Dhaka and towards host towns that are better equipped to cope with an expanding population, and where migrants can be fully fledged, as opposed to second-class, citizens. It is early days in a long-term process that has been hampered by Covid and the UK government cutting the aid which was funding the research, but Huq is confident that Mongla and its sister towns will become models of disaster management, adaptation and resilience.

1/24/2022,"Have you ever had an accident at work that wasn’t your fault? A delve into the archive of a major insurer has revealed some of the strangest valid commercial claims, including recompense for a defenestrated dentist and a farm worker blown into a vat of liquid manure. The trawl through 325 years of business insurance claims received by Aviva also reveals instances where policyholders found themselves a part of events that would end up in history books.  They include investors who lost money in the 1963 Great Train Robbery and a fishmonger caught up in the 1984 Libyan embassy siege – the van was parked nearby and could not be moved until the siege ended, by which time the fish had rotted. Among other notable claims unearthed as part of an exercise linked to the anniversary of its commercial lines arm was the £1,000 payout for the “Dundee whisky fire” of 1906. Eyewitnesses described “rivers of burning whisky” flowing through the Scottish city after a fire at the warehouse of the merchant James Watson & Co. It might be nearly 60 years ago but the Great Train Robbery, in which £2.5m was stolen from the Glasgow to London Royal Mail train, continues to fascinate the British public. The Aviva archives reveal it paid out just over £1m to owners of securities that were among the loot. That sum equates to £59m in today’s money. The records also reveal that the insurer found itself on the hook after another dramatic heist, this time in the 1990s when thieves made off with “Woody the Cuprinol man”. The wooden figure, who appeared in the wood preserver brand’s TV adverts, was recovered with Aviva telling the special effects company to “lock Woody up at night”. The trawl through history also reveals some tales of unexpected woe. A slightly built farm worker tasked with carrying large sheets of corrugated iron was carried away by a gust of wind and deposited into a liquid manure storage tank. According to the claim “the employee’s clothes were ruined”. There is also an account of a dentist who similarly experienced a crash landing. In the early 1960s, they received a payout after being kicked out of a window by a patient coming round from an anaesthetic. Perhaps predictably for an insurer, Nick Major, commercial lines’ managing director, suggested the long list of weird and wonderful claims showed “planning for the unexpected is good business practice”. “Aviva has played an important role helping businesses protect what’s important to them, enabling them to continue to trade through good times and bad, something we have continued to focus on through the Covid-19 pandemic,” he said.",News/Business,Defenestrated dentists and burning whisky: insurer reveals weirdest commercial claims,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/24/defenestrated-dentists-and-burning-whisky-insurer-reveals-weirdest-commercial-claims
1/24/2022,"Agreat big crumpet appears to have landed in the middle of Budapest’s City Park, its circular hole-studded mass impaled on a thicket of trees. It droops down here and there, revealing little terraces cut into its top, and flares up elsewhere, showing off a sparkling underside of tiny golden leaves.This surreal sight is the work of Sou Fujimoto, a Japanese architect known for making his models out of piles of crisps, washing-up scourers, or whatever else may be to hand. In this case, it wasn’t a crumpet but a lotus root that inspired this canopy, which now provides an otherworldly home for the capital’s new House of Hungarian Music. In a city that already has a renowned opera house, music academy and numerous concert halls, what could this €80m (£67m) project possibly add?“We want to show the wonder of music to a younger generation,” says music historian András Batta, managing director of the new centre, which opened on Hungarian Culture Day this weekend. He is standing in the building’s glade-like interior, where oval openings bring light down through the swooping ceiling, and an aperture in the floor gives a glimpse of the exhibition level below. Faceted glass walls enclose a 320-seat concert hall and a small lecture theatre, while a suspended staircase spirals up to a library, cafe and classrooms, housed in the undulating roof. “Budapest has a very rich musical life already,” he adds, “so we didn’t want to repeat what you can get elsewhere. This is not just for high and classical, but ethnic, folk and pop – the really exciting side of music.”  The building is one of the first major elements of the €1bn Liget project, a controversial vision concocted by populist prime minister Viktor Orbán’s rightwing government to transform the Városliget area into a showcase of Hungarian national culture. A €120m Museum of Ethnography is nearing completion nearby, in the form of two gigantic sloping wedges rearing up out of the ground, clad in a strange lacy wrapping that nods to Hungarian national dress. A colossal €300m National Gallery is planned to the north, designed by Japanese architects Sanaa as a topsy-turvy stack of tilting white planes that looks caught in mid-collapse. There are plans to reconstruct a palatial neo-baroque pile, bombed in the war, as a House of Hungarian Innovation, as well as rebuild an art nouveau theatre, demolished in the Soviet era, as a children’s centre. And if that’s not enough, the construction of “Europe’s largest biodome” is under way in the zoo next door (unfinished and on hold after funding ran out).“Budapest doesn’t have an obvious identity for tourists,” says László Baán, ministerial commissioner in charge of the Liget project, standing over a large model of the park, dotted with the new attractions. “With these contemporary buildings we can put Budapest on the map, creating the most complex cultural district in Europe.” It is every (would-be) dictator’s dream leisure-scape, clearly conceived to echo the scale of ambition in the Habsburg era, when the park was laid out and flanked with regal palaces of art for the 1896 Millennial Exhibition. Critics suggest the scheme is chiefly motivated by Orbán’s desire to move the government to Buda Castle, where the National Gallery is currently housed, further aligning himself with imperial glory days. His self-styled “illiberal democracy” may have curtailed the free press, crushed academic freedoms and curbed gay rights, but he is keen to ensure a legacy of large cultural baubles.The future of his vision, however, is in jeopardy, after Gergely Karácsony – Budapest’s centre-left mayor who was elected on a green platform in 2019 – called for a halt to the “government concrete mania in one of the world’s first public parks”. Echoing the activists who chained themselves to structures to try to prevent construction of the House of Hungarian Music, he has said he will defend the park from future development “with my own body, if necessary, and I will encourage all Budapest residents to do so”. He has agreed that projects under construction can be completed, but no further work will begin – for now, at least. The changes to the park so far have had a mixed reception. A big new playground, running track and public sports pitches have been wildly popular with some, while others lament the transformation of what was a quiet and leafy, if rather scruffy, haven into a busy outdoor activity centre. An impressive new conservation and storage facility has brought world-class restoration labs, but the looming ethnographic museum, by local firm Napur, seems widely disliked. (Ironically, its cartoonish form was chosen in an anonymous competition by a jury who thought they were picking the work of Danish star Bjarke Ingels.)Given this context, the House of Hungarian Music stands out as the most thoughtful part of the jumbled offering. Replacing a cluster of dilapidated Soviet-era expo offices, which had been run down and off limits for years, the building keeps a low profile and does its best to nestle among the trees. The roof is sculpted and punctured to allow existing sycamores to rise through its holes, extending beyond the building line to shelter an outdoor stage. In Fujimoto’s words: “We wanted to transform the forest into architecture.”The architect grew up on the edge of woodland in rural Hokkaido, the northernmost of Japan’s main islands. He often talks of trees, glades and clearings as an inspiration, enjoying the sense of being in an open field while also protected and enclosed, encouraging people to walk and discover. Further probing of his intentions wasn’t possible: he declined interviews and hasn’t visited the completed building. Perhaps he is wary of being photographed with Orbán, mindful of the backlash after Ingels was snapped with Brazil’s president Jair Bolsonaro.This is Fujimoto’s first permanent public project in Europe, and it’s a departure from what you might expect, given his 2013 Serpentine Pavilion in London and his housing block in Montpellier, France. His competition-winning scheme depicted a smooth white world, in the familiar contemporary Japanese style, but his clients wanted something warmer and cosier. They took him to visit the secessionist palace of the Liszt Academy of Music, whose art nouveau ceiling writhes with gilded leaves, and inspired an about-turn. The seamless white pancake became encrusted with geometric golden leaves, and its roof cutouts also lined with gold, while the columns turned from mirror-finished to dark grey to match the tree trunks outside. In places, it can feel a bit much, Fujimoto’s organic minimalism dressed in a kitsch folk costume, but the festive garb is fitting for a place dedicated to celebrating the magic and theatre of music. The exhibition itself, curated by Batta and operational director Márton Horn, is a family-friendly riot, charting the history of European music through a sequence of interactive displays. Reached via a white spiral stair, it begins with a circle of drums, which must be pounded to lure wild animals out of a virtual forest, before introducing the Hungarian dance house movement, where you are invited to copy traditional folk dances on a responsive dancefloor inside a little wooden cabin. Next you can conduct a virtual choir of Gregorian monks, alongside a display of early codices, before being thrust into the holographic worlds of Haydn, Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, and into a section on opera – complete with an interactive screen of operatic face filters for the selfie generation. A section on technology charts innovations from the phonograph to the cloud while, elsewhere, you can remix classic film soundtracks, try your hand at DJing and learn a range of instruments. A second temporary exhibition space will open later in the year with a show on Hungarian pop music from 1957-93, which promises to be full of equally bizarre delights. The party continues in a room next door in the form of a “sound dome” inspired by the Kugelauditorium – a spherical concert hall created by Karlheinz Stockhausen for the 1970 World Expo in Osaka. With 32 speakers arranged behind a perforated hemispherical dome, it plunges visitors into an immersive audio-visual experience, beginning with a selection of short films shot in the countryside, but it promises to liven up with planned DJ nights and screenings.The spiral stair carries you into the depths of the crumpet, where Fujimoto’s vision begins to feel more compromised, the architectural idea trumping practical needs. The competition drawings looked seductive, showing a hidden world tucked inside the roof, but when you’re in the library, lit from above, it’s hard not to think it might have been nicer to have some windows looking out on to the park. The classrooms and offices also feel squeezed into the restrictive floorplan, rather than the form of the building being designed around them, although a cafe terrace does look out on a fun musical playground outside.The House of Hungarian Music is, ultimately, a welcome addition to the park, but it’s not enough to convince that pursuing the rest of the Liget plan would be wise. With six opposition parties joining forces in an attempt to topple Orbán in the April elections, there is a chance that his overblown vision might remain just that.",Arts/Art and design,Sou Fujimoto’s House of Hungarian Music: ‘We wanted to transform the forest into architecture’,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/24/sou-fujimotos-house-of-hungarian-music-we-wanted-to-transform-the-forest-into-architecture
1/24/2022,"Ultra-Orthodox Jews in the UK are launching an organisation aimed at engaging with the wider British public in a move that may mark a significant shift from their traditional insularity. The Pinter Trust has the backing of rabbis and leaders from the main ultra-Orthodox, or Charedi, communities in north London, Manchester, Gateshead and Essex.  Its aim is to “build trust and dialogue with other organisations and groups” and to “seek to provide an accurate and truthful portrayal of the UK Charedi community”. A website launching on Monday will include information about the community, a blog and points of contact. The trust is named after Rabbi Avrohom Pinter, a well-known figure in Stamford Hill, north London, and a former Labour councillor, who died with Covid in 2020. Pinter was regarded as an ambassador for the community. Rabbi Avroham Sugarman, chair of the trust, said the organisation hoped to build on his legacy. “The Pinter Trust will seek to tell the story of the Charedi community in the words of the community itself. Whilst we are not seeking external publicity for our community … we want to give people a greater understanding of who we are and our way of life.” The trust would work “to build meaningful partnerships” with the media, local and central government and other groups, Sugarman said. Charedi Jews are the fastest-growing sector of the UK Jewish population, mainly because of their large families: seven or eight children are common. They are rigorous in their observance of their faith. Using electricity, phones or cars is prohibited on Shabbat, the Jewish sabbath. Men and women follow strict dress codes; school curriculums are dominated by religious teaching, with boys and girls segregated; access to television and the internet is tightly controlled. Charedi Jews publish their own newspapers and newsletters, and regard the mainstream media as unsympathetic to and ignorant about their way of life and concerns. Local authorities with significant Charedi communities liaise with community leaders to get across public service information – and, in the past 22 months, essential public health messages about Covid. Joel Friedman, the trust’s director of public affairs, said the community had been considering setting up a public-facing organisation for three years. “The Charedi community is growing,” he said, “but it doesn’t have a proactive voice telling our story to the outside world. Traditionally it has been an insular community. “But there are a lot of misconceptions out there, and if the community is represented in a bad light to the wider population, that has a negative impact.” He said the website would be “very basic” to begin with, but more content would be added over time. “This is a new thing for our community, we need to bring people with us.” The trust hoped to invite people outside the community for tours and visits to communal settings, and would engage with other faith organisations, government bodies and local authorities, he said. David Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, welcomed the launch of the organisation, saying it would build inter-community awareness, dialogue and trust and was “vital at this pivotal moment in our nation’s history”. He added: “I know the community it represents, and all those who come into contact with [it] will be enriched.” Rabbinical authorities, including the Gateshead Kehilla, the Federation of Synagogues, the Union of Orthodox Hebrew Congregations (UOHC), the Machzikei Hadass Communities of Manchester and the Manchester Beth Din, have endorsed the trust. Rabbi Yehuda Baumgarten of the UOHC said: “The Pinter Trust will act as a credible and respected voice on matters concerning Anglo Charedi Jewry, under the guidance and leadership of respected community rabbis from across the UK.”",News/World news,UK’s ultra-Orthodox Jews launch trust to engage with wider public,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/24/uk-ultra-orthodox-jews-launch-pinter-trust
1/24/2022,"The morning after Meat Loaf died, his former bass player Steve Buslowe was reading through the many celebrity tributes to the bombastic singer when he came across one that made him laugh. “I saw a comment that Stephen Fry had made about Meat being cuddly and frightening at the same time. I laughed because that’s perfect. He was such a big teddy bear. He was sometimes warm, but then he could also get a little manic, a little out of control, maybe a little violent. So you never knew who he was going to be. He was kind of fearless in being warm and generous, but also in his anger. If he got frustrated with something, he wouldn’t go in a corner and pout. He’d throw a chair. He’d be in your face to let you know how he felt.”  Buslowe, 67, is in a contemplative mood as he speaks via Zoom from his home in Connecticut. The musician and backing vocalist, who is my uncle, played with Meat Loaf for the best part of the singer’s career, witnessing his rise to megastardom during the Bat Out of Hell tour in 1977-78, the wilderness years of dwindling sales in the mid- to late-80s, and his resurgent global success in the early 90s with Bat Out of Hell 2: Back Into Hell. The singer’s talent and temperament made a strong impression on Buslowe from their first meeting, after the bass player auditioned to join Meat Loaf’s live band, later called the Neverland Express. “When I first met him at the rehearsals, I knew he was a unique person,” he says. “I still remember having chills watching this man sing four or five feet away from me. He had this amazing operatic voice. I knew I was dealing with somebody very special but complicated. As time went on, I saw how complicated he would become.” Buslowe, who had been playing with funk fusion bands before the tour, admits he didn’t immediately get Meat Loaf’s dramatic sound. “I said to myself: I can’t believe I just joined a band that has a song called Paradise by the Dashboard Light. Though, of course, I grew to love it.” He was not alone in having this initial reaction. The band was met with a hostile crowd at their first gig in Chicago, opening for the rock group Cheap Trick. “People were swearing at us, throwing things, saying really nasty things about Meat Loaf being overweight,” says Buslowe. “It was horrifying. But I think it got us revved up, no pun intended, to say screw you, we’re going to push it.” This rocky start to the tour was amplified by Meat Loaf’s erratic behaviour. Buslowe recalls how the singer hired one of his friends to be their driver-cum-tour manager, despite having no relevant experience. On the way to a gig in Youngstown, Ohio, the friend’s fast, nausea-inducing driving led to a punch-up. “Meat had gone up to the front and said slow down, everybody’s going a little crazy,” says Buslowe. “Well, the guy wouldn’t. Meat went nuts and he goes: ‘Pull over!’ Well they pull over at a rest stop right off of this highway and the two of them get out and start beating the crap out of each other!” Buslowe remembers looking through the window of the band’s RV at the songwriter Jim Steinman, the creative mastermind behind Bat Out of Hell and Meat Loaf’s other most epic hits, watching bemusedly the fight on the grass in the truck stop. “I’m sitting there going: what did I get myself into? This is madness! Of course, Meat and the guy wound up being friends again. But that was Meat’s personality: he could get really angry with you, and after he gets that out of his system, he can be your best friend.” Steinman and Meat Loaf’s musical partnership was infamously fractious. Buslowe recalls how the balance of power shifted towards the singer as that first tour gained momentum and his star rose. “There were some people who said, not that I would use this expression, it was like Frankenstein and the monster – where Jim was really the brains behind the songwriting and Meat was just the singer,” he says. “As the tour developed, Meat got a more dominant role because he got the attention. But he also knew that instead of it just being like a theatrical show, he had to be more aggressive on stage and make it more rock’n’roll. And I think he was proven right.” However, as detailed in his 1999 autobiography, To Hell and Back, the singer increasingly struggled with the demands of touring. His voice began to give out on him. He started using cocaine. He raged at the band members and audiences, throwing microphone stands at them. Then in May 1978 he fell off the stage at a gig in Ottawa, breaking his leg and leaving him unable to perform. He had a nervous breakdown. “My memory, a lot of times, was sitting in a hotel lobby waiting for Meat to walk out of the elevator door,” says Buslowe, who did not discuss the singer’s drug and mental health issues. “Depending on the look on his face or the way he walked, I knew what kind of day I was going to have. I really learned to recognise what to say and when to say it, and, more importantly, if he’s in a lousy mood, when not to say anything. “Meat wasn’t always good with a lot of pressure. I felt sorry for him because he was a little fragile in that way. But without him there was no band. We were really hired musicians. For me, it was a struggle to be waiting on him because you have no control. There was also a lot of frustration coming from the record company and the managers because everybody’s trying to make money.” Amid the singer’s ongoing crisis, Steinman decided to make his own album, Bad for Good. Although he subsequently wrote Meat Loaf’s 1981 album, Dead Ringer for Love, best known for his hit duet with Cher, neither record performed on a par with Bat Out of Hell, which Buslowe partly attributes to them being released so close together. With this diminishing success, the singer and songwriter’s relationship fell apart. During this period, Buslowe co-wrote four tracks on Meat Loaf’s third album, Midnight at the Lost and Found, including the title track, which reached a disappointing peak of No 17 in the UK. “It was thrilling for me to perform my own songs,” he says. “Regrettably, the album didn’t get good reviews. I don’t think Meat cared for it all that much.” The bass player left the band in 1984, returning two years later when Meat Loaf began touring smaller venues, including pubs and clubs, in an attempt to revive his career back and stave off bankruptcy. Paradoxically, Buslowe says the singer’s voice was at its best during this low point of his fame. “It was fun for me because he was a lot more relaxed,” he adds, attributing much of this to the calming influence of the singer’s first wife, Leslie. “He didn’t have a big record deal. We were just going day by day, building it back up. It was a real healthy time for him, and also for me to watch him grow.” By 1990, Meat Loaf and Steinman had reconciled, leading, three years later, to the release of Bat Out of Hell 2. The album sold more than 14m copies worldwide, with its lead single, I’d Do Anything for Love (But I Won’t Do That), topping the charts in 28 countries. “When things got successful again, there was more money, but there was more pressure again, and I could feel that from him,” says Buslowe, who by this point had become the musical director of the Neverland Express. “I was kind of middle management between the band and Meat. I helped translate what he wanted. He liked to think of himself as an actor doing a role as opposed to just somebody singing words. He took it upon himself to do a lot of improvisation. You had to always watch him to make sure that you understood what he was going to do. It was always evolving because he was into the performance and really looking at and responding to the audience, and a lot of musicians can’t do that.” His time with the band ended in 1997, two years after the release of the seventh studio album, Welcome to the Neighbourhood. “I think the relationship ran its course,” Buslowe says, adding that this coincided with Meat Loaf moving from Connecticut to the west coast to pursue his acting career. “I could sense that there was a change in his direction. I’d been wanting to move away from the music business and I felt I wasn’t going to be rehired. I just didn’t feel it anymore.” Although I remember him being frustrated with Meat Loaf during this period, Buslowe, who has also worked with Bonnie Tyler, Air Supply, Céline Dion and Barbra Streisand, is now more sanguine about the split. “I wasn’t necessarily unhappy that it ended but it could have ended better. But I have heard from other people over the last couple of years that he still had good feelings about me. So that made me feel good. I think he always respected me and he knew that I was fairly loyal to him. But neither of us picked up the phone to call the other. “There was a time when I thought he would take a bullet for me,” he says. “I really think that he had this ability to be very protective of people that he cared for. Then there were times when he just didn’t handle people well. I could feel it happening to me a little toward the end of our relationship. I don’t want to say I didn’t take this personally but I just knew that’s the way he was. He really could be a very loving, warm, generous guy. But he had his demons and his struggles.”",Arts/Music,"‘Warm, loving, generous – but he had demons’: inside the life of Meat Loaf",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/24/warm-loving-generous-but-he-had-demons-inside-the-life-of-meat-loaf

It is a magical moment in the day, even if you are rushing off to get to work, and this week brings with it some astronomical jewels to pick out of the twilight.  This week, from London the sun rises at about 7.45am GMT, so your vigil needs to start about an hour before then. Looking low in the south, you will see the beautiful red jewel of Antares. Further east will be the brilliant white beacon of Venus, and between these two will be a difficult-to-spot Mars. The chart shows the view looking south-east from London at 7am GMT on 28 January. On this morning, a waning crescent moon will join the tableau. The morning after, the moon passes Mars, helping you pick it out. The view is much easier to see in the southern hemisphere. From Sydney, Australia, at about 5.30am AEDT, Antares, Venus, and Mars will stand proud from the eastern horizon, and the moon will appear to be plunging downwards on successive mornings.",News/Science,Starwatch: magic of sunrise comes with added bonuses,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/24/starwatch-sunrise-antares-venus-mars

1/24/2022,"The first full moon of the year has fallen like a dream in a clear spell. Its other name – wolf moon – evokes a folk memory of bone-deep hunger and boreal chill, which, if my social media bubble is anything to go by, still has the power to draw us outside, to our back gardens and city streets, to beaches and mountain tops. We are moon gazers still, and this night in particular is feeding an urge to make fire, immerse in water or get high, one way or another. My little family is doing so literally, with a walk on the northern edge of the North York Moors. It’s not a place I enjoy much by day – too scoured in the name of management – but it has undeniable grandeur tonight. What we really mean when we speak of dark skies is land dark enough to not be a distraction, and south of here is a vast mass of that.  Not that this terawatt moon needs help. Torches are unnecessary. Each slab of the path is so silvered, my son can see well enough to run. Also shining bright and early are Orion and the Plough, and my personal lodestar at this time of year, Sirius, flashing hectically two or three random hues a second. I discovered only recently that not everyone sees these colours (binoculars apparently make it more obvious), but to my eye, it’s garish, blaring and impossible to ignore. Perhaps there’s something in old tales of it driving dogs and women mad. Ten miles north of the moor edge, dark yields to dazzle. Teesside shimmers like a fantastical treasure hoard: silver, gold and red, trickling and spilling into surrounding villages and towns. It’s eerily silent though, for a view so full of people, as if for a few sparkling minutes, life down there is on hold. A pulsating blue light appears in the dark below, tracking smoothly east. From this distance, its progress is painfully slow, and I want to reach down with a finger and whizz it towards its destination. It disappears among the pinprick lights of Great Broughton and I find myself muttering an almost-prayer, a plea for light on behalf of anyone who might need it, before we descend again ourselves.

1/24/2022,"Large-scale Covid-19 outbreaks among students are unlikely to lead to school closures when classes resume in New South Wales, with the state government determined to shut down schools only in the case of key staff shortages. The NSW and Victorian governments have released near identical plans for schools ahead of the resumption of classes next week.  Both states intend to use rapid antigen tests for twice-weekly “surveillance” testing during the first four weeks of term one, the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, saying on Monday that 5m tests had already been distributed to schools across the state. But with just a week to go before classes resume, some school staff were “anxious” as supplies of rapid tests had yet to arrive, Craig Petersen, the head of the NSW Secondary Principals’ Council, said. While the NSW education department says in most cases tests will be delivered in the next two days, it will be left to the individual schools to distribute those to parents. “It’s going to be really important for parents to keep an eye out for communications from their school principal because we get the high-level statewide information but it’s going to be very different from school to school,” Petersen said. Perrottet has repeatedly said closures would only occur as a “last resort” in 2022, as the government looked to end the Covid-enforced disruptions which saw 289 public schools made “temporarily non-operational” in a little over a month between October and November last year. A key plank of that plan for both states is an end to contact tracing if a student tests positive for the virus. Instead it will then be up to individual schools to contact other parents to let them know there has been a positive case in the school community and that they should monitor their child for symptoms. That, according to the NSW Teachers Federation president, Angelo Gavrielatos, has both teachers and parents concerned about the possibility of large-scale outbreaks inside schools, particularly with schools only provided with enough tests for the first few weeks of term. “What we’ve certainly said, because we’ve argued for the most robust settings in the implementation of these risk mitigation strategies, is that we think there should be a system surveillance, plus also the option of what’s called test and stay in cases where outbreaks occur,” he said. But while both governments want to limit school closures, multiple sources told Guardian Australia it was likely shutdowns would occur in cases where disruptions to staffing made it impossible for classes to continue. Education department officials have told administrators it was possible as many as 20% of staff could be off sick once classes resume, and last week the Guardian revealed more than 70 public schools across NSW already had staff vacancy rates of 20% or higher. “Clearly none of us want schools to be closing and infection rates to be affecting our schools but the reality is this will be a very disruptive school year,” Gavrielatos said. “Regrettably there will be absences because of infection rates which will lead to some schools being non-operational. It could be as a result of there being no cleaning staff available, or because of inadequate staffing available to properly supervise students.” Petersen said education officials had suggested closures would only occur as the result of “so many staff being away that we can’t provide minimal supervision for the students who are at school”. “The line we’re hearing is that as long as staff are available we’ll keep schools open,” he said. “That may be more likely to affect the primary school sector where teachers are in a particular class, as opposed to high school where you have teachers in multiple year groups.” On Monday the secretary of the NSW education department, Georgina Harrisson, said that in cases where schools were forced to close, the government would seek to limit the length of the disruptions. “If we need to move to learning from home, we will do it for the fewer students as possible for a shorter time as possible and we ask parents to follow the advice of your school if that occurs in those communities,” she said. Amid reports some parents plan to keep their students home from school once classes resume, Perrottet on Monday sought to reassure parents the plan was “the right approach for the circumstances that we are in today”. “As a parent as well I know that many parents across the state are anxious about sending their children back to school, many teachers are anxious; I was speaking to a teacher on the weekend … anxious about the return of school,” he said. “That is understandable in a pandemic, but it is really, really important for our kids’ educational, mental health and social outcomes that they are back in the classroom. I accept it will not be perfect, there will be issues moving through this, but this is the right approach.”",News/Australia news,Covid outbreaks among students unlikely to shut NSW schools but staff shortages could,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/24/covid-outbreaks-among-students-unlikely-to-shut-nsw-schools-but-staff-shortages-could
