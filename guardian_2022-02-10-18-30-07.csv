2/10/2022,"A police sergeant in a remote Aboriginal community briefed officers on a proposal to safely arrest a fugitive but they ignored this plan the night the Warlpiri man was shot dead, prosecutors allege. Sgt Julie Frost was in charge of the police station in Yuendumu, 300km north-west of Alice Springs, in November 2019 when 19-year-old Kumanjayi Walker was shot three times by Constable Zachary Rolfe during an attempted arrest at a house.  Rolfe is on trial for Walker’s alleged murder in the Northern Territory supreme court. He has pleaded not guilty to that and alternate charges. Frost told the court on Thursday that on the night Walker was killed she provided a briefing to Rolfe, three colleagues from the Alice Springs-based Immediate Response Team – who receive specialised training in arresting high-risk targets – and an officer trained to handle police dogs. Frost said she had called in the extra resources because of multiple issues including local officers deployed elsewhere, a spike in break-ins, unrest in a nearby remote community, the departure of medical staff, and the need to safely arrest Walker, who days earlier had threatened two police with a small axe. Rolfe and the other officers from Alice Springs arrived in Yuendumu about 7pm on 9 November 2019. Frost told the court that in a briefing which started about this time, she had told the officers she expected them to spend the rest of the night handling jobs that came through the on-call phone, conducting high-visibility patrols that would “saturate” areas where there had been break-ins, familiarising themselves with the community and escorting medical staff on any jobs. She said that as part of that briefing, and in a separate plan she had also emailed the officers earlier that day, Frost told the officers that they would meet up at 5am on 10 November with a view to arresting Walker while he was sleeping about 30 minutes later. “A early-morning arrest like that is a far safer time to arrest people,” Frost told the court. “We know that they will be sleeping, and it gives the element of surprise.” During the briefing, Frost said one officer, though she could not remember who, asked what they should do if they came across Walker that night, to which she responded “by all means pick him up”. Frost told the court that Constable James Kirstenfeldt – who she found before the briefing to be “very dominating” as “it appeared he was trying to take over the conversation and would not listen to me” – also asked whether there were many guns in the community, to which she responded there was not. The briefing finished after about five minutes and images shown to the court indicate Rolfe left the station with his colleagues at 7.06pm. Frost did not deploy with the officers. Prosecutors have previously told the court that Rolfe and the other officers went immediately to House 577, a property where Walker had often stayed with his partner. The officers were told at the house that Walker was not there but he may be at a property known as House 511, where his grandmother lived. Rolfe and his colleague, Constable Adam Eberl, located Walker inside that house. He was asked to put his hands behind his back by Rolfe, but instead pulled a pair of medical scissors from his pocket and brought them down in a stabbing motion into Rolfe’s left shoulder. Eberl then struggled with Walker, who was shot soon after by Rolfe, the court has heard. The first shot is not subject to any charges but the second and third shots, which the prosecution alleges were fired several seconds later from close range by Rolfe when Eberl had control of Walker, are the basis for the murder charge. The three shots were fired at 7.21pm – 15 minutes after Rolfe left the Yuendumu police station. David Edwardson QC, for Rolfe, said his client would defend his actions as being reasonable and justifiable in the context of the danger faced by him and Eberl. Edwardson said Rolfe was acting in self-defence, and to defend the life of Eberl, when he fired the second and third shots and his training emphasised that “edged weapon equals gun”. The defence also disputes that Eberl had control of Walker when the second and third shots were fired. Edwardson said gathering intelligence on Walker was included in the plan and so therefore it was logical to attend house 577 and see if he was there. Edwardson will cross-examine Frost on Friday. On Thursday, the court also heard from Lottie Robertson, the grandmother of Walker’s partner Rickisha Robertson and a Yuendumu elder. She said Frost had been “really angry” when she spoke with her about Walker threatening the officers with an axe, with Frost saying that he could have been shot dead or harmed a police member. Robertson had agreed with Frost that Walker should hand himself in, and said “we tried very hard to talk to him”. She clarified that culturally it was more appropriate for her husband Eddie responsibility to speak to Walker, which he did, but she said there was little response from Walker about whether he would surrender. “He’s not a man of many words,” she said. Robertson said Walker had come back to Yuendumu after escaping from a residential alcohol treatment centre and removing an electronic monitoring device to attend a funeral. Detective Acting Snr Sgt Evan Kelly completed his evidence on Thursday. He was not in Yuendumu at the time of Walker’s death, but was Rolfe’s supervisor in Alice Springs and had previously instructed him to “take a look” at Walker’s background after he was identified as an arrest target. Kelly said he met with Rolfe the night of the shooting after he had returned back to Alice Springs, but did not discuss the incident with him. He said three or four days later, he also went to Rolfe’s house where he was joined by colleagues including other officers who had been in Yuendumu on the night of the shooting: Eberl, Kirstenfeldt, and Snr Constable Anthony Hawkings. He said “we were basically having a barbecue and a couple of beers as a welfare check on Constable Rolfe” but said he did not discuss the shooting and he did not hear anybody else discussing it. He gave extensive evidence about police training, including that it was futile to make “rigid” arrest plans, and he had been taught that if he was to shoot an offender he should fire twice then assess if he had “gained subject control”, before firing again. Kelly also gave evidence that it was a matter of “personal preference” whether officers decided to walk with their hands on their firearms during certain operations. Earlier this week, the prosecution showed footage of Rolfe raiding a property with his hand on his firearm, which had been unclipped – something they argue indicates he was more willing to use his firearm than is supported under his police training. “Some officers will walk with their hand on their firearm. Some officers don’t,” Kelly said. “But having your hand close to your firearm will allow for a faster draw if something presents itself.” Under questioning from Sophie Callan SC for the prosecution, Kelly clarified it was not common for officers to leave retention devices on their holsters unclipped, in order to be able to remove their firearm more quickly – something the prosecution alleges Rolfe did while raiding other properties in Yuendumu.

2/10/2022,"The state of California is suing Tesla over allegations of operating a “racially segregated workplace” at its factory near San Francisco. California’s department of fair employment and housing (DFEH) said it had filed a lawsuit alleging widespread discrimination and harassment of black employees following complaints from hundreds of Tesla workers at its main factory in Fremont.  “After receiving hundreds of complaints from workers, DFEH found evidence that Tesla’s Fremont factory is a racially segregated workplace where black workers are subjected to racial slurs and discriminated against in job assignments, discipline, pay, and promotion creating a hostile work environment,” Kevin Kish, the DFEH’s director, said in a statement. The department claimed black Tesla workers were subjected to racist graffiti and racial slurs. The agency said it filed its lawsuit at on Alameda county superior court late on Wednesday, and would make the complaint available to the public on its website on Thursday. In a blogpost pre-empting the announcement of the filing, Tesla described the lawsuit as “misguided” and said it would ask the court “to pause the case and take other steps to ensure that facts and evidence will be heard”. Tesla said the DFEH had “declined to provide Tesla with the specific allegations or the factual bases for its lawsuit”. “Attacking a company like Tesla that has done so much good for California should not be the overriding aim of a state agency with prosecutorial authority. The interests of workers and fundamental fairness must come first,” it said. “Tesla strongly opposes all forms of discrimination and harassment and has a dedicated employee relations team that responds to and investigates all complaints.” Tesla was ordered by a Californian federal court last year to pay almost $137m (£101m) in damages to a black former employee who said he endured racial abuse while working at Fremont. Owen Diaz, a former contracted elevator operator who worked at the plant between 2015 and 2016, alleged he was harassed and faced “daily racial epithets” including the “N-word”. He also said employees drew swastikas and left racist graffiti and drawings around the plant. Diaz was awarded $6.9m in damages for emotional distress and $130m in punitive damages, in what is believed to be the largest such verdict of its kind.",News/Business,California sues Tesla over ‘racial segregation’ claims at factory,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/10/california-sues-tesla-over-racial-segregation-claims-at-factory
2/10/2022,"Cameroonian asylum-seekers deported by the Trump administration suffered imprisonment, torture and rape on their return, and many were forced in to hiding or fleeing the country once more, according to a new report. In the last months of the Trump administration, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency stepped up its deportations of African migrants, especially Cameroonians. Over 80 of them were flown to Cameroon in October and November 2020 alone, amid allegations of abuse, in which Ice detainees said they had been forced to sign or fingerprint documents believed to be waivers agreeing to their deportation.  The deportations took place despite warnings from lawyers and human rights groups that those being sent back would be in danger. A Human Rights Watch (HRW) report published on Thursday found that almost all of those deported in 2019 and 2020 faced reprisals of some sort on their return to Cameroon, from rape and beatings to detention and extortion or simply having their identity cards confiscated. West Cameroon is still in the grip of a conflict between the government and armed anglophone separatists, with frequent reports of arbitrary killings and military patrols in the streets. Anyone without an identity card faces the risk of detention. The 149-page HRW report, “‘How Can You Throw Us Back?’: Asylum Seekers Abused in the US and Deported to Harm in Cameroon,” says that between 2019 and 2021, Cameroonian security forces detained or imprisoned at least 39 people who had been sent back by the Trump administration. Many of those were held without due process and in inhumane conditions, some in solitary confinement. HRW found 14 cases of physical abuse, 13 by Cameroonian security forces and one by armed separatists. Three women were raped in custody by “state agents”, and other detainees were severely beaten during interrogation. The deportees had all fled Cameroon to escape the conflict, in particular the government’s brutal treatment of those suspected of involvement in the separatist movement. On being forcibly returned to Cameroon, they were additionally accused of having harmed the country’s reputation by seeking asylum. The HRW report found that Ice had failed “to protect confidential asylum documents during deportations, leading to document confiscation and apparent retribution by Cameroonian authorities”. One woman who was deported in October 2020 said she was tortured and raped by government soldiers over six weeks in detention in Bamenda, northwestern Cameroon. “Every two days ... they were using ropes, [rubber] tubes, their boots, military belts ... They hit me all over my body,” she told HRW. “They said that I’ve destroyed the image of Cameroon ... so I had to pay for it.” After initially being allowed home, another returnee was summoned to a police station two weeks later, supposedly to pick up his documents, but he was detained instead. “They said ‘you are the guys who go out there spoiling the name of the country’. That is when my second nightmare began,” he told the Guardian. He was held for five months until his family paid a CFA franc 2m ($3500) fine for his release. He has since fled the country and is hiding elsewhere in West Africa. Many of the returnees went into hiding to avoid arrest. In the case of seven of them, according to the report, the police or army targeted family members to try to force them to reveal their whereabouts. One returnee’s sister is alleged to have been shot and killed, another’s mother was severely beaten, and the 11-year-old son of another returnee was abducted and questioned by security agents. One of the deportees, known by the pseudonym Cornelius in the report, said he and others were interrogated on arrival in 2020. “Army officers were asking us why we had sought asylum, what we had told American immigration,” Cornelius told the Guardian. Some of the returnees on the same plane were arrested and taken away and Cornelius did not see them again (HRW has not been able to trace some of the deported Cameroonians). Cornelius and others were held in a detention facility for a few days and then released, but without their personal papers. “They took our documents, our ID cards, passports and everything,” he said. “They never told us a reason, but a police officer later on told me that we may think we are safe but they can arrest us at any time. So since then, we were all scared.” Cornelius went into hiding, staying indoors for the next ten months, until he managed to get a receipt for his ID card from the police. He had been held in Ice detention centers for 18 months, mostly in Louisiana and Mississippi. He was placed in solitary confinement for a month, and saw other Cameroonian detainees being pepper sprayed, put in stress positions and doused in water. In Mississippi, he said he was threatened with the same treatment if he did not sign papers agreeing to his deportation. “I was so so so down. I was demoralized. I didn’t know what to do,” he said. In the end the guards grabbed his hand and pressed his fingerprint on to a document. He was put on a plane back to Cameroon soon after, on 14 October 2020. “This was not the America we were watching on the movies or hearing about on the news. I thought this is not the America they were talking about,” he said. In February 2021, the Biden administration stopped an Africa-bound Ice deportation plane from taking off, and several of the Cameroonians on board were questioned in what officials said was an investigation into allegations of Ice abuse. No results of any investigation have been made public, and in October 2021, several more Cameroonians (HRW estimates three or four) were deported. he Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment. In response to the HRW report on abuse of returnees in Cameroon, a state department spokesperson said: “Actions of this nature, such as those in these allegations, are abhorrent to our values. The United States promotes respect for human rights and condemns abuse of any kind.” “As we are learning of these allegations, we will take appropriate steps,” the spokesperson said. “The Biden administration will probably try to pass it off on the Trump administration because some of these egregious abuses occurred while Trump was in office,” Lauren Seibert, a HRW refugee and migrant rights researcher and author of the report, said. “But I don’t think the systemic issues that really led to what happened to these people have been resolved at all within the US immigration and asylum system.” “The Cameroon and US governments need to remedy these abuses, and US authorities should provide opportunities for wrongly deported Cameroonians to return and reapply for asylum,” Seibert said.",News/US news,"African migrants deported in Trump era suffered abuse on return, report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/10/african-migrants-deported-trump-administration-suffered-abuse
2/10/2022,"There is something remarkable about Joe Burrow. Call it an aura, call it swagger, call it what you want. In the abstract, talk of an ‘it factor’ feels like a whole lot of blathering to explain the unexplainable: His Cincinnati team playing above their understood talent level. And then you watch the games, and you see it: Tough to identify; impossible to ignore. Burrow has rejuvenated a sorry Cincinnati franchise who, up until the quarterback’s arrival in 2020, had laid their claim to fame as being the cheapest, most stable presence in the league. They rarely hit rock bottom, lows were always accompanied by flashes that the good times were around the corner: The heady days of the Carson Palmer-Chad Johnson era; five-straight trips to the playoffs (and five-straight losses) behind Marvin Lewis, Andy Dalton, and a stacked roster.  There have been smatterings of success, but the Bengals have rarely been Fun. When Johnson rechristened himself as Chad Ochocinco the team briefly flirted with the idea that football could be about more than just getting by. But the fetishization of mediocrity has been the overriding principle of the 33 years of Mike Brown’s ownership. Hitting .500 is enough, the playoffs are a bonus. Burrow walking through the door changed everything. You will struggle to find another team so disconnected from the scars of their past. The Bengals have that delightful sense of a good-not-great team a couple of years ahead of schedule. There’s none of the bitterness of tough playoff losses or the pain of years of toil. They’re young, fun, fearless. It’s a franchise that now oozes charisma; whose quarterback sports a monogrammed, diamond-encrusted chain; whose kicker delivers one-liners before drilling game-clinching kicks; whose gaggle of young stars gather for victory cigars after each playoff win. Their quarterback’s own story is now well-documented: the former four-star recruit from Ohio who went to Ohio State to represent the Buckeyes, was beaten out by Dwayne Haskins, transferred to LSU, then – boom! – lift-off. Burrow led the Tigers to a national title in his second season, serving as the conductor for what is widely regarded as the finest offense in the modern history of college football. He won the Heisman Trophy too. He took an LSU team that had been inconsistent before his arrival (and collapsed as soon as he left) to heights that even one of the game’s great programs had yet to scale. It’s been the same story in Cincinnati: Burrow arrived when the team had hit a low, a two-win season that secured the first overall pick in the draft and a chance to bring Burrow back to Ohio. Within two seasons, he has taken them to the Super Bowl. At first glance, Burrow has done all of that without an obvious [cliché klaxon] – elite, physical skill set. Run through the list of young quarterbacks who have elevated into the upper tier in the NFL in recent years. All of them have a defining physical trait: Lamar Jackson has speed; Josh Allen, Justin Herbert and Patrick Mahomes have their size and arm strength. Not Burrow. His superpower is his pocket mobility, that prescient sense for when to slip and slide, to evade the pass-rush, to extend plays, and to find open men down the field. Pair that with uncommon down-the-field accuracy and smarts, surround him with playmakers like Ja’Marr Chase, Tee Higgins, Tyler Boyd and CJ Uzomah, and – hey presto – you have yourself an explosive offense. A reminder: Burrow is doing all of this behind one of the league’s most porous offensive lines. The Bengals ranked 28th in pressure rate this season, a statistic that usually sends a team tumbling to the top of the draft, not the Super Bowl. The line was bad enough last year that there were calls for the Bengals to bench Burrow before he got hurt and threatened the future of his franchise, a season in which he ended up tearing his ACL. Things aren’t much easier for him this season. At the right guard spot alone, Cincy has gifted 48 pressures over the course of the season. And perhaps Burrow has another superpower: an unusual ability to connect with others. At LSU, his coaches viewed him as a partner in all of the key decisions and gameday playcalls. They ditched the usual top-down player-coach dynamic and viewed the relationship with Burrow more as a partnership. That same connection has extended to his fanbase and the wider football-watching world. Maybe it’s that innate ability to straddle the line between cool and dork. Maybe it’s the JB9 jeweled pendant … or the cigars … or that coat … or the quiet, assured confidence … or the seeming effortlessness of his excellence. It’s important to note that the rest of the Cincy roster isn’t just along for the ride. The Bengals defense is as advertised: Savvy, splashy, ultra-confident, the players comfortable in their own skin, and a pain to play against. The skill positions surrounding the quarterback are loaded. Still: This is Burrow’s team and Burrow’s story. Only five quarterbacks have won the Super Bowl with the team that drafted them No1 overall in the modern era – including Eli Manning who was part of a draft-day trade. On average, those titles came in the quarterback’s seventh season with the franchise. Being drafted first overall is a recognition of a player’s talent – and it’s also a burden. Teams select first overall because they stink. Their roster is flimsy, the culture rotten. It takes time to turn a failed team around. To hit on the right coaches. To build the right scheme around the right players. To cobble together enough talented players to make a playoff run. It requires hitting on the draft and free agency year-after-year amid roster churn; an aspect made more difficult in the salary-cap era. In fact, of the quarterbacks selected first overall in that era, only two have gone on to win the Super Bowl with the team that selected them – both happened to have the surname Manning. Scaling that mountain is supposed to be hard; Burrow has made it look easy. If Burrow leads the Bengals to the title on Sunday, he will become only the third quarterback in the history of the league to win a national championship in college and a Super Bowl. Nobody has hit for the quadruple crown: Winning the title and the Heisman trophy in college, being selected first overall in the draft, and then winning it all in the pros. Burrow is on the verge of conquering all four inside of three years. “I think if you told me before the season we would go to the Super Bowl, I would have called you crazy,” Burrow said after the AFC title game. Crazy to him, perhaps. But it shouldn’t be to anyone else. This is who Burrow is: Everywhere he goes, he wins – and wins big. The Bengals have not been a championship organization in the modern era. At times, it’s felt like they’ve been playing a different sport to everyone else, with different goals. They’ve won in spurts, often despite their own team-building principles. Now, they have the most important ingredient in a championship roster: A franchise quarterback, in every sense. Burrow and the Bengals have arrived. And they’re not leaving anytime soon.",Sport/Sport,How Joe Burrow dragged the Bengals from also-rans to charismatic contenders,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/10/joe-burrow-cincinnati-bengals-quarterback-super-bowl-nfl-football

2/10/2022,"Unilever has ruled out pursuing any more big deals after the failed £50bn offer for GSK’s consumer healthcare division, as the Marmite to Dove soap maker beat expectations in the fourth quarter with sales revenue growth boosted by price rises. The embattled consumer products company, which is facing increasing pressure from shareholders to restructure, including potentially splitting its businesses or shaking up its board, also announced a €3bn (£2.5bn) share buyback scheme.  “We have engaged extensively with our shareholders in recent weeks and received a strong message that the evolution of our portfolio needs to be measured,” said Alan Jope, Unilever chief executive. “We therefore do not intend to pursue major acquisitions in the foreseeable future.” The company, which has already unveiled a structural overhaul to give five business divisions more control, reported a 4.9% rise in underlying sales growth in the fourth quarter – well ahead of the 3.8% City consensus. Full-year sales grew by 4.5% to €52.4bn, the fastest underlying growth in nine years, with 2.9 percentage points of that attributable to price increases, and 1.6 percentage points to growing sales. “The acceleration of Unilever’s operating performance continues,” said Jope. “The major challenge of 2021 has been the dramatic rise of input costs. We responded with pricing actions.” The FTSE 100 company, known for brands such as Dove soap, Hellmann’s mayonnaise and Ben & Jerry’s ice-cream, said it expects “very high” cost inflation of €2bn in the first half of this year. Cost inflation may moderate to €1.5bn in the second half, Unilever said. “There is currently a wide range for this that reflects market uncertainty on the outlook for commodity, freight and packaging costs,” the company said. Earlier this week, top 10 shareholder, the asset manager, Flossbach von Storch said Unilever should seriously consider splitting the company, which operates three divisions for beauty, food and household products. Leading Unilever shareholder Terry Smith, the founder of Fundsmith, has described the failed attempt to takeover the GSK business as a “near death experience” and said management should focus on improving the core operation – or step down. Last month, Unilever announced plans to cut 1,500 management jobs globally, as the company tried to respond to calls for an improvement in operating performance. The move came as it emerged that US activist investor Nelson Peltz had built a stake in the company, although he has not as yet said publicly what changes he is pushing for.

2/10/2022,"Keir Starmer has blamed Boris Johnson’s slur about Jimmy Savile for inciting a mob that accosted him outside parliament on Monday. The Labour leader said he had never before been accused in public of being a “paedophile protector” until the prime minister falsely accused him of failing to prosecute Savile when he was director of public prosecutions (DPP) a week before the attack.  In an interview with the Times, Starmer said Johnson had used a “deliberate slur without any basis in fact”. He added: “The PM knew exactly what he was doing. It is a conspiracy theory of violent fascists that has been doing the rounds for some time.” On Monday, police escorted the Labour leader and the shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, away from demonstrators, some of whom accused him of protecting paedophiles while others shouted “nonce” and “Jimmy Savile”. The prime minister has refused to apologise for the remark but has since clarified that he was not referring to Starmer’s personal record at the Crown Prosecution Service. Starmer told the Times: “I have never been called a paedophile protector before. That happened [on Monday] for the first time in my life. If others want to argue that this is unconnected with precisely what the PM said one week before then let them make that case. But they’ll never persuade me that there is no link.” He reiterated that he had no involvement in the decision not to prosecute Savile. He said: “I knew nothing about the decision. When Savile died I instigated a review to audit whether any cases had come across the desk of any CPS officers and discovered at that stage decisions had been made.” Starmer added: “It’s not about me, it’s the way we conduct our politics. I don’t want to see us go down the route that this potentially takes us.” Following the barracking of Starmer on Monday, Johnson tweeted that the “behaviour directed” at the Labour leader was “absolutely disgraceful”. But several Conservative MPs urged him to go further by apologising for what has been called a “scurrilous accusation” against Starmer. Labour said Monday’s incident occurred when Starmer, accompanied by Lammy, was walking back from the Ministry of Defence after a briefing on the situation in Ukraine. Starmer is travelling to Brussels where he and Johnson will separately meet the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, to discuss Ukraine. “The message is that we are firm and united in our support for Nato,” Starmer told the Times. He also distanced himself from his predecessor Jeremy Corbyn – a long-term Nato sceptic. He criticised Corbyn for refusing to accept that Russia was responsible for the Salisbury poisonings. “What was said by my predecessor in relation to issues like Salisbury was wrong.
