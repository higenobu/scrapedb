2/2/2022,"Facebook parent company Meta (FB) will report its Q4 earnings results on Wednesday, marking the social media giant’s first report since its rebranding as a metaverse-first firm. Here’s what analysts are expecting of the company’s quarter, as compiled by Bloomberg, compared to how it performed in the same quarter last year. Revenue: $33.4 billion expected vs. $28.0 billion in Q4 2021. Earnings per share: $3.84 expected vs. $3.88 in Q4 2021. Ad revenue: $32.5 billion expected vs. $27.1 in Q4 2021. Facebook monthly active users: 2.9 billion expected vs. 2.8 billion in Q4 2021. Meta app family monthly active users: 3.5 billion expected vs. 3.3 billion in Q4 2021. Meta’s Q4 marks the first time it will report its earnings as a company focused on building out the metaverse, not just social media apps like Facebook and Instagram. But Meta has warned it will take time to build out its metaverse capabilities to the level where users can interact with each other across vast virtual worlds via augmented reality and virtual reality headsets. Still, Meta is plowing money into the effort, spending $10 billion on its metaverse work in 2021. And the company said it will continue to invest in its virtual world platform for years to come. More pressing in the near term is Meta’s ability to continue to navigate Apple’s (AAPL) recent privacy changes that allow iOS users to opt out of letting their apps track them across the web. The feature, called App Tracking Transparency, has been a roadblock for apps like Facebook and Snap (SNAP), which rely on that kind of data to sell ads to advertisers. During Meta’s Q3 earnings call, CFO David Wehner specifically pointed to App Tracking Transparency (ATT), calling it a potential headwind for the social networking behemoth. BofA’s Justin Post, however, believes Meta will have a solution to ATT in the coming months. “For 4Q call, commentary on IDFA impact remains an important stock driver, we believe Meta will make faster progress compared to peers in developing IDFA workarounds, with potential benefits by 2Q [2022],” he wrote in an analyst note ahead of Meta’s Wednesday earnings. That’s not Meta’s only problem, though. The company continues to face increasing competition from the likes of TikTok and Snap, and, more importantly, must contend with an ongoing antitrust lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission. Earlier this month District Judge James Boasberg ruled that the FTC’s suit against Meta can continue despite protests from the social networking company. In its suit, the FTC alleges that Meta ran a buy or bury scheme in which it sought to quash competition from smaller up-and-coming rivals. The commission ultimately wants to break Meta up into smaller social networks. Without its combined network of apps, however, Meta would lose its spot as the world’s largest social media company. Whether that comes to pass, however, will take years to determine, as the suit is unlikely to be resolved in short order.

2/2/2022,"The investment options in your retirement plan may improve after the U.S. Supreme Court sided with Northwestern University employees who alleged the university’s retirement plans had excessively high fees and simply too many options. In a six-page opinion published last week, the nation’s highest court vacated a previous U.S. Court of Appeals ruling in Hughes vs. Northwestern, remanding the case back to the appellate court for reconsideration. While the opinion doesn’t include a specific order or set of recommendations that will immediately reshape the retirement industry, the Supreme Court was clear: plan sponsors fail to fulfill their fiduciary duty when they do not monitor their investment offerings and eliminate those deemed to be imprudent. A financial advisor can help you plan for retirement and select investments that align with your financial goals. Find a trusted advisor today. Hughes vs. Northwestern: Inside the Case The legal battle began in 2016 when three current and former Northwestern employees sued the school, its retirement investment committee and several officials who administer the 403(b) plans, alleging they violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). The lawsuit specifically alleged the defendants failed to monitor and control recordkeeping fees; offered “retail class” mutual funds and annuities that carried higher fees than identical share classes with the same investments; and offered too many investment options (over 400), which led to confusion among plan participants. However, a U.S. District Court dismissed the case in 2017 and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit subsequently affirmed the lower court’s dismissal. But the Supreme Court disagreed with the previous rulings in the case, asserting the 7th Circuit “erred in relying on the participants’ ultimate choice over their investments to excuse allegedly imprudent decisions” by the plan sponsor. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who wrote the opinion, rooted the court’s decision in a 2015 ruling in Tibble v. Edison Int’l. In that case, the Supreme Court concluded that a fiduciary’s failure to monitor investments and remove “imprudent” options constitutes a breach in duty. Despite the fact that defined contribution plan participants choose their investments, plan fiduciaries must independently evaluate the plan’s menu of options to determine which are prudent, the court opined. But the 7th Circuit did not apply the guidance from the Tibble case when it rejected the plaintiff’s arguments, Sotomayor wrote. “Instead, the Seventh Circuit focused on another component of the duty of prudence: a fiduciary’s obligation to assemble a diverse menu of options,” she wrote. The appellate court found the defendants offered plan participants an adequate assortment of investment options, including low-cost index funds. But that doesn’t go far enough to satisfy a fiduciary’s duty of prudence, according to Sotomayor and the justices. “Even in a defined-contribution plan where participants choose their investments, Tibble instructs that plan fiduciaries must conduct their own independent evaluation to determine which investments may be prudently included in the plan’s menu of options,” Sotomayor added. As a result, the Supreme Court remanded the case to the 7th Circuit, where the appellate court may reevaluate the plaintiffs’ arguments and consider whether the allegations amount to a violation of fiduciary duty. What it Means Going Forward How will the Supreme Court opinion impact the retirement industry going forward? Plan sponsors will likely become more discerning when it comes to the investment options they offer, according to John Rekenthaler, vice president of research for Morningstar. In his most recent Morningstar column, Rekenthaler wrote that plan sponsors will not only trim their investment offerings to reduce sub-par options, but they will also pressure mutual fund companies for more institutional share classes, which typically charge lower expense ratios. Rekenthaler added that plan sponsors will continue to trade out actively-managed funds for passively-managed, lower-cost index funds. That would all be good news for retirement savers. Nevin E. Adams of the National Association of Plan Advisors, meanwhile, wrote that plan sponsors will become more critical of the funds offered within a retirement plan in light of the Supreme Court’s opinion: “It seems fair to say that there will now be a (much?) greater fiduciary sensitivity to the issue of monitoring the funds on the plan menu. As, arguably, there not only should be, but always should have been.” Bottom Line The Supreme Court sided with Northwestern University employees who sued the school in 2016 over allegedly excessive fees and high-cost investment options offered within the school’s retirement plans. In a six-page decision published last week, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that the appellate court failed to consider a fiduciary responsibility to monitor investments within a plan and eliminate imprudent options. Simply offering a variety of investments and letting participants pick the best ones does not satisfy a plan sponsor’s fiduciary duty, according to the court.

SmartAsset’s retirement calculator can help you figure out how much you could have by the time you’re ready to stop working. Those planning for retirement focus heavily on saving and often overlook their plan for efficiently spending that money. The 4% Rule dictates that withdrawing 4% of your savings in the first year of retirement and adjusting withdrawals for inflation in subsequent years will enable you to stretch your savings up to 30 years. But recent research shows that a 4% withdrawal rate may be too high. Instead, retirees implementing looking for fixed retirement income should start out by withdrawing only 3.3% of their nest egg.

2/2/2022,"What to make of the markets today? Volatility is way up. January brought us a market correction to start out 2022 – but then the last three trading sessions saw impressive daily gains. Investor sentiment is getting a boost from a generally positive earnings season, but Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, JPMorgan's global head of equity research, has identified some additional support for the markets. “[The] Fed is likely to strike a more dovish tone relative to extreme investor expectations, which could trigger an equity rebound. Expectations are so hawkish at this point, we believe the bar for a positive surprise from the Fed at the current juncture is fairly low,” Lakos-Bujas noted. The stock analysts at JPMorgan are following the strategy team’s lead, and finding stocks with a bullish outlook going on from here. Their comments make some interesting reading, as do their predictions of 40% upside or better. Let's take a closer look. GitLab (GTLB) We’ll start by looking at GitLab, a DevOps platform that allows enterprise customers to develop software with both speed and efficiency while maximizing the overall return of the final software product. The platform allows for collaborative planning, building, deployment, and security in the development process. GitLab is an ‘open core’ company, meaning customers can use the basic platform for free as an open source system; the company sells proprietary upgrades and add-ons by subscription. The open core model has been successful for GitLab. The company was founded back in 2014, and since then has seen its base expand to some 30 million users. This number includes 1 million active license users – the source of revenue – and 2,500 members of an active community of users and developers who offer contributions to the open source base software. GitLab jumped the IPO bandwagon last year, taking advantage of the bullish market trends to go public and raise capital. The IPO opened in October; the company put 10.4 million shares of common stock on the market at $77 each – and then saw the stock jump to more than $100 on its first day of trading. GitLab raised approximately $650 million through its initial offering. Since then, however, the stock has fallen sharply, by some 41% from its first-day closing price. In December, GitLab reported its first quarterly results as a public company, for Q3 of fiscal year 2022. The release showed a strong 58% year-over-year revenue gain, from $42.2 million in the year-ago quarter to $66.8 million in the current report. GitLab’s revenue was supported by even stronger increases in the customer base, with a 66% gain in customers with more than $5,000 in annual recurring revenue (ARR), and a 73% gain in customers with more than $100,000 in ARR. These facts lie behind 5-star analyst Sterling Auty's optimistic view of the company. In his coverage for JPMorgan, Auty sees GitLab holding a strong position for long-term growth. ""The company has been expanding its modules available at an industry-leading clip since 2012 and is unmatched in its completeness. In addition, the company’s leadership team and culture offers significant competitive advantages. We believe we are moving past the software bear market that started November 12, 2021 and, since 2000, companies with solid beat and raise growth profiles outperform in the 12 months after a bear market. We believe GTLB is one of those companies,"" Auty explained. In line with these comments, Auty bumped his stance on GitLab from Neutral (i.e. Hold) to Overweight (i.e. Buy) and set a price target of $99. This target implies a hefty one-year upside of ~47%. (To watch Auty’s track record, click here) The Strong Buy consensus rating on GitLab, held up by an 8 to 2 split between Buy and Hold reviews, shows that Auty’s Wall Street colleagues agree with his bullish stance. The stock is selling for $67.56 and has a $121.33 average price target, even more bullish than Auty allows – and indicating room for an additional 79% of upside this year. (See GTLB stock forecast on TipRanks) ChargePoint Holdings (CHPT) The second stock we’re looking at is ChargePoint, a leader in the EV charging network ecosystem in both the US and in Europe. ChargePoint’s 5,000+ commercial fleet customers include more than three-fourths of the Fortune 50 companies, and its 163,000+ networked charging points give it a 70% market share in the North American and European networked EV charging markets. ChargePoint had a good year last year, as far as the top line shows. Revenues rose in 2021, and the 3Q results – the last reported – came in at $65 million, for a 79% year-over-year increase. In the wake of the strong revenue result, the company raised its full-year 2021 revenue estimate to the range of $235 million to $240 million, a 3.2% increase at the midpoint. Despite rising sales, ChargePoint’s stock is down. The shares were volatile in 2021, but the falling-off trend was clear – and CHPT is down 63% in the last 12 months. However, JPMorgan’s Bill Peterson sees several reasons for investors to assume a turnaround for ChargePoint, and writes that the current pullback equals an opportunity. “We have developed more confidence around the ChargePoint story. Given the stock’s recent pullback, we see a good opportunity for investors... Specifically, the company is well-positioned to benefit from growth in all customer verticals in the US, and increasingly so in Europe…. we think investors may be too pessimistic on ChargePoint’s expenses and path to profitability; for us, the added investments in its go-to market efforts are key to seed the company’s target markets. Thus, the reward should be strong, sustainable growth with an expanding customer base,” Peterson wrote. These comments support Peterson’s upgrade of CHPT from Neutral (i.e. Hold) to Overweight (i.e. Buy), and his $20 price target shows his confidence in a 40% one-year upside potential. (To watch Peterson’s track record, click here.) The mix of views on ChargePoint shows how Wall Street is cautiously bullish here; the Moderate Buy rating is based on a combination of 7 Buys and 4 Holds. The stock’s $27.09 average price target implies ~90% upside from the trading price of $14.24.
