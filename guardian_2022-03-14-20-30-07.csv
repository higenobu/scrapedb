3/14/2022,"In the example clues below, I explain the two parts of each one: there is a definition of the answer and there is some wordplay – a recipe for assembling its letters. In a genuine puzzle environment, of course, you also have the crossing letters, which hugely alleviate your solving load. Hence “crossword”. Also, the setters’ names tend to link to profiles of the individuals behind the pseudonyms. Sometimes a clue will make reference to a boy or a girl. What letters is the setter expecting you turn them into? Happily, “girl” is rarely nowadays used in a clue to indicate the letters BIRD or BIT in an answer. A different vintage word survives, one that won’t have “(derog.)” alongside it in the dictionary. And when there is a GEL, it’s often specified that the girl in question is posh, as with Vulcan’s clue … 26a An upper-class girl? A girl (6)[ wordplay: AN (“An”) + synonym for upper-class girl + A (“a”) ][ AN + GEL + A ][ definition: girl ] We’ll come back to girls’ and boys’ actual names below; for now, it’s worth remembering that “gel” is not always posh; it’s used by Norman Stanley Fletcher to his daughter in Porridge: And the GEL might equally be a GAL – or, especially if specified that she is of the upper crust or is in some sense “stepping out”, she may, even nowadays, turn out to be a DEB. Every boy is some mother’s son. So when Chifonie give us this clue … 17a Boy to take home poem (6)[ wordplay: synonyms for “boy” + “to take home” ][ definition: poem ] … we change “boy” to SON and “to take home” to NET for the poem, a SONNET. Since he’s not always acting as someone’s SON, he might also be a LAD or even a TAD – as in, I suspect, a tadpole. Other times, you’re asked to imagine you’re folksily addressing a girl, with a diminutive form of a woman’s name. Here’s Arachne: 18d Writer’s regret, having embraced quiet girl (7)[ wordplay: synonym for “regret”, surrounding (“having embraced”) synonym for “quiet” (as an instruction) & a girl’s name ][ definition: name of a writer ] So we take RUE and insert SH and the girl DI for the writer RUSHDIE. When it is a girl’s name, I try DI, EVE and ADA first; if one of those is not the girl in question, then I often get the answer from the definition and work backwards to confirm the presence of a MO, a DOT, a MIA, an ENA, a VI … and so on. And so it is with boys. Here’s Gordius: 17a With apprehension of little boys at arm’s length (7)[ wordplay: two short forms of boys’ names, separated by the letters ARM (“at arm’s length”) ][ AL + ARM + ED][ wordplay: with apprehension ] With boys, ED and AL are my go-to names, but I may later find that the child in question was the slightly longer TED or ALI, or indeed TOM, LEN, DAN, TIM, or NED. There’s also IAN, though he’s still often referred to as a Scotsman. And sometimes the setter might be kind enough to give you the long form of the name you’re to shorten. That said, “kind” is not a word that springs to mind when confronted with this from Paul: 11a Sweet Queen Elizabeth, perhaps, protecting herself, Elizabeth and daughter (7,3)[ wordplay: what Queen Elizabeth is an example of (‘ … perhaps’), containing (‘protecting’) abbrev. for current ‘Queen Elizabeth’ (‘herself’), short form of ‘Elizabeth’ & abbrev. for ‘daughter’ ][ SHIP, containing ER & BET & D ][ definition: sweet ] It’s a SHERBET DIP. If you’re wondering whether “boy” or “girl” might offer still more of crosswords’ abbreviations, we’ve discussed the fact that you might see “b” and “g” in genealogy but not in the dictionaries – but that’s in one of our not-for-beginners features.

3/14/2022,"Two Russian activists have broken into and occupied a luxury villa in Biarritz owned by Vladimir Putin’s former son-in-law. Pierre Haffner, of the Svoboda Liberté Association, whose blog appears on the Mediapart news website, and Sergey Saveliev entered the eight-bedroom Alta Mira property in the French coastal resort, popular with Russian oligarchs. They announced on social media that they had changed the locks and would offer it to house Ukrainian refugees fleeing the war. The property is said to belong to Kirill Shamalov, a Russian billionaire and former husband of Putin’s younger daughter Katerina Tikhonova. Haffner and Saveliev claimed to have found one of Shamalov’s passports and a translation of a Moscow electricity bill. A photograph posted on social media shows one of the activists on an upper floor balcony with a Ukrainian flag. Haffner, who said he was renaming the property “Villa Ukraine”, said he would ask human rights activists and lawyers to ask Biarritz city hall and the olice prefecture to use it to house refugees from Ukraine. The exiled Russian dissident Vladimir Osechkin, founder of a human rights group that has exposed alleged rape and abuse in Russian prisons and who is on Russia’s most wanted register, told the Guardian: “The police are now trying to get into the villa to arrest Pierre and Sergey. It’s a difficult situation that needs to be highlighted by journalists and human rights groups.” On Facebook, Osechkin wrote: “In Europe, hundreds of villas were bought by Putin’s family and their oligarch accomplices. Their luxurious bourgeois life has come to a logical end, for war crimes and crimes of the regime will have to pay … Now it’s not about glamorous parties and parties in villas. It’s important to be responsible and fair in the 21st century. We continue.

3/14/2022,"Scott Morrison has said the Coalition wants Australia’s coal power stations to “run as long as they possibly can”, vowing to support the coal industry if re-elected. Morrison made the comments in a Sky News town hall on the New South Wales Central Coast on Monday, during which he tested attack lines against Anthony Albanese and warned leadership was “not for the faint-hearted or inexperienced”. Asked by the audience if he supports the coal industry, Morrison replied “the short answer is yes” but stopped short of endorsing a call for the government to build new coal power stations. Morrison said the Coalition’s policy is for coal power stations to “run as long as they possibly can” to provide baseload power “when the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine”. He noted the government’s investment in the $600m Kurri Kurri gas power plant, which he said provides “backup” power and can be switched off an on. Morrison said he is concerned about the early retirement of the Erraring coal station. “We want to see replacement for that reliable, affordable capacity here in the Central Coast.” Morrison said if the private sector wants to build new coal power plants that was “fine”, provided they were “commercial” and “stack-up”. He suggested this was unlikely, given the required state government approvals. On electric vehicles, Morrison said he was “not forcing anyone to drive anything” and the Coalition’s policy was one of “choice not mandates”. In November Morrison deliberately mischaracterised Labor’s electric vehicles policy as somehow forcing drivers to adopt electric vehicles. The town hall continued Morrison’s attempts to reframe the election around national security and the economy in a bid to recover the government’s poor standing in the polls. On Monday the Newspoll found the Coalition trailing 45% to Labor’s 55% in two-party preferred terms. Morrison argued the May election would be a choice about who was “best prepared and most seasoned to see us through” global instability including the war in Ukraine. In front of an at-times partisan crowd that cheered for the re-election of the Coalition, Morrison accused Albanese of “pretending to be everyone” – from John Howard, to Bob Hawke, to Kevin Rudd. The prime minister claimed, by contrast, he was not “pretending to be anyone else”. “I’m still wearing the same glasses, and the same suits,” Morrison said, in reference to Albanese’s new look. “I’m happy in my own skin … When you’re prime minister you can’t pretend to be someone else.” Morrison said his faith “informs the why not the what” of his policy agenda, explaining he had been “transparent” about his religious belief but it was “not a reason to vote for me or not to vote for me”. Morrison criticised Labor, claiming the opposition saw the Covid-19 pandemic as an invitation to be part of Australians’ lives “for the rest of eternity”. “[We have] a business led economy, that isn’t one with government at the centre of our lives, telling us what to do. Frankly, we’ve had enough of government telling us what to do in the last couple of years.” Morrison said the Coalition would aim to repay debt by “bending” the curve of government expenditure down and growing the economy, noting that the Coalition had taken six years to return the budget to balance after it was elected in 2013. It “didn’t go down the slash and burn approach”, he said, because of stiff economic headwinds. Morrison said Labor’s slogan to “build back stronger” after the Covid pandemic “sounds good”, but claimed it implicitly suggested that there was “something wrong with Australia before the pandemic”. Morrison also claimed that Labor would have spent $81bn more than the Coalition throughout the pandemic, because it had called for jobkeeper wage subsidies to be extended. Labor “complain about the debt, but wanted to spend more”, he said, labelling that phenomenon “Albanomics”. Morrison defended his handling of the pandemic, arguing although there were many “knockers” of the national cabinet, across 64 meetings federal, state and territory leaders had agreed on most issues. “Name one family who gets together every night and never has a disagreement,” he said. Asked why the Coalition wasn’t ahead in the polls, Morrison argued that through the pandemic and natural disasters “people have suffered a lot” and “understandably people will get very frustrated”. He expressed confidence that closer to the election the choice of “who you want to lead” would become clearer.",News/Australia news,Scott Morrison says coal power stations should ‘run as long as they possibly can’ ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/14/scott-morrison-says-coal-power-stations-should-run-as-long-as-they-possibly-can
3/14/2022,"Gordon Shaw is a Scottish artist and comic book creator who was diagnosed with a brain tumour in his early 30s; this documentary shows him coming to terms with his condition by transforming it into graphic art, an open-ended autobiographical project which takes the form of zines, pictures and exhibitions. Shaw has the inspired idea of taking the notorious buzzing and deafening clangs experienced by people undergoing an MRI scan and converting these sounds into an electronic musical event, which people would experience from within a scanner-style enclosure. (“It’s horizontal techno, but of course you can’t dance!”) He calls his tumour “Rick” (the way Dennis Potter called his cancer “Rupert” after Rupert Murdoch, but “Rick” doesn’t seem to be anyone he dislikes) and this film shows him fighting the growth with humour and honesty. This is a film with its own artless, almost amateur kind of video-diary directness, and Shaw himself has a childlike kind of smileyness and fun. And his trials are made even more challenging by the fact that his partner Shawn lives in the United States: Shaw’s condition makes it difficult for him to travel out there to see him – and then Covid arrives, making it difficult for Shawn to come over. Towards the end of the film, with the clinical news getting worse, Shaw addresses the camera directly in his flat (seated just next to a Bill Hicks cushion) and speaks with candour about what his choices are right now. It would have been interesting to hear more from Shaw about the work itself, and from his audience about what they get out of the imagery. But this is a tender portrait.

3/14/2022,"Claire Kohda’s debut is memorable for the refreshing perspective of her conflicted heroine: a vampire of mixed ethnicity and recent art graduate. Lydia struggles to accept the demon inside her and yearns to love, live and eat like a human. Her father, a successful Japanese artist, died before she was born. Lydia has committed her mother, a Malaysian-English vampire in declining health, to a home in Margate and accepted an internship with a contemporary London gallery known as the Otter. Woman, Eating opens with Lydia renting an artist’s studio in a converted biscuit factory. She’s shown around by the kind and friendly Ben, to whom she is immediately attracted. At the gallery, Lydia is given banal jobs cleaning labels off bottles and adding velvet pads to coat hangers in preparation for the next opening. Largely ignored by the staff, Lydia receives the unwanted attention of the director – cold, predatory Gideon – who, she learns, had collected her father’s art. He stands in the shadows observing her, unaware that, as a vampire, Lydia can see him in the dark and the blood coursing through his veins. One day, passing on the stairs, he gropes her buttock. It’s an act he’ll later regret. Kohda is excellent at conveying Lydia’s alienation and sense of powerlessness – the realisation that as an intern she is invisible and irrelevant. Less engaging are the descriptions of Lydia’s inactivity at the studio (where she also sleeps). Alone, she rolls around the floor, scrolls through Instagram posts and YouTube videos, consumed by thoughts of human food and the demonic desire to drink blood. While Lydia is well drawn, several of Kohda’s characters feel sketchy. The fellow artists who rent studios are names rather than personalities. Certain plot strands are left hanging. We never find out what happens to her mother languishing in the aptly named Crimson Orchard and Kohda has a tendency to explain her vampire tropes rather than allow us to draw our own conclusions. However, there is much to admire in this original take on millennial angst. Kohda’s depiction of a young woman’s appetites – sexual and emotional – and Lydia’s loneliness are perceptive. Kohda makes some sharp observations about the world of modern art, its elitism and the precarious nature of jobs in the creative sector: “What’s after internships?” Lydia asks. Kohda need not worry. The fact she’s already working on a television adaptation suggests a fruitful career ahead.  Woman, Eating by Claire Kodha is published by Virago (£13.99).

3/14/2022,"Alex was working as an aviation journalist when he first visited Kazakhstan in October 2011, to interview the head of the country’s national airline. “Originally, I was planning to stay longer, to explore, but I was so tired that I decided to return to the UK early,” he says. At Almaty airport, he spotted a woman reading a Stephen Fry book. “She was very attractive. Because of the book, I realised she must speak English and might be going to London.” To his delight, she sat down next to him when they boarded. “I wasn’t meant to be on that flight, either,” says Aizhan, 34. “But I was travelling to London, to study for my master’s degree in HR, and had lots of admin to do, so I decided to go early.” Alex, 43, helped her with her luggage and they got chatting during the meal. “It felt like a first date,” she says. “He’s half French and he told me how to make frogs’ legs. I remember writing about it in my diary later. I even wrote a joke about people who meet in random places and end up getting married.” They exchanged email addresses at the end of the flight and he wrote to her soon after, but didn’t hear back. “I assumed that was it and I’d never see her again,” he says. A few months later, though, when Aizhan was settled in the UK, she added Alex on Facebook. “She sent me a message asking if I wanted to go to a comedy show,” he remembers. “I said yes straight away.” But Alex got stuck in the Netherlands because of a snowstorm and couldn’t make it to the gig. When he got back, he invited Aizhan to a bar in Soho with some friends. “It was nerve-racking, but it was a great place and everyone was salsa dancing,” she says. Over the next few months, they continued to meet as friends. Although they both liked each other, they weren’t sure how the other felt. “There were some cultural misunderstandings,” says Alex. “One day, I took her out with one of my friends and when I went to get cigarettes she thought I was trying to set her up with him.” In May 2012, Aizhan invited Alex to her birthday celebrations. That was the night they first kissed. “After that, he took me to Cannizaro Park in Wimbledon to see the blossoming rhododendrons. It was so beautiful,” she says. As she was younger than him, Alex didn’t want to push her to get serious too quickly. “It freaked me out, because, in my culture, it’s normal to be married by the age of 25 and we don’t date for a long time before marrying,” she says. In the summer, Aizhan went to Kazakhstan to visit family. “I realised she might move back there one day and I knew I couldn’t be without her,” says Alex. That August, he proposed; they married two months later. They lived in London for the next two years, but Alex was keen to leave journalism. “I’d always dreamed of opening a brewery or running a vineyard,” he says. “When Aizhan gave me a book called Apples Are from Kazakhstan, I discovered that was where apples were originally cultivated. It sparked the idea of starting a cider-making business.” They moved to Almaty, the cultural capital, in 2014 and, after two years of studying, set up a cidery in 2016. “I think I have read every cider book and been to every conference there is,” Alex says. The couple have two children, Adam and Aidan, born in 2013 and 2015. Alex loves that his wife is organised and intellectual, as well as beautiful. “In the past 10 years, I’ve seen her flourish and it just brings another level of love and respect,” he says. “I’d never really imagined a type of person I would fall in love with, but being married to someone from a different part of the world really adds something to your relationship.” Aizhan says Alex was Prince Charming from the start. “I never thought I’d have this magical encounter. He was so attentive and sensitive. He always sees things from my point of view. We complement each other in so many ways.” Want to share your story?

3/14/2022,"We have spotted sea beet on the sandy dunes near my parents’ house in Dorset. And, more recently, we’ve noticed it pushing defiantly through the shingle beach at Santa Marinella in Lazio. It’s a rugged and edible coastal plant, with glossy, gently serrated leaves, that thrives near tidelines in Europe, Africa and Asia, and it is the ancestor of all cultivated beets (or, more precisely, Beta vulgaris). Many beets are cultivated for their swollen roots: sugar beet, red beet (beetroot), and the wonderfully named mangelwurzel, or fodder beet, all of which have edible leaves, too. Others, notably spinach beet and Swiss chard, are grown primarily for their leaves and fleshy midribs. That beetroot and chard are related was a revelation almost as satisfying as discovering that the woman at the bookshop is the cousin of the man at the chemist (it’s all in the eyebrows). In his masterpiece Nosedive: A Field Guide to the World’s Smells, Harold McGee begins the soil chapter with the Roman naturalist Pliny, who thought the smell of fertile soil was the mixed breath of sun and earth. McGee then leaps 2,000 years ahead and recounts how Australian scientists named the smell of dry rock and earth being moistened petrichor, from the Greek petri (rock) and ichor (blood of the gods). Also how scientists identified the bacteria that creates volatile molecules in soil and named these particles geosmins, geō meaning “earth” and osmḗ smell. For a long time, biologists thought that beets got their distinctive, earthy-musty smell from the soil they grow in. But then experiments in 2003 demonstrated that they make their own geosmins, the exact amount depending on the species and colour. The more roots and depth of colour a variety has, the more geosmins. Hence the deep, earthy-musty smell of beetroot, and the milder earthy-breath of chard (and our slightly damp bathroom wall). It is the ones with fleshy midribs and earthy breath that are required this week. Swiss chard with broad, flattened white stems, and tender, glossy leaves is ideal here. One big bunch, two recipes, inspired by Simon Hopkinson and his brilliant book The Vegetarian Option. The stems are boiled until tender, covered with a duvet of bechamel, and baked, while the leaves are wilted in a pan with olive oil, chilli and garlic. Stems and leaves are then reunited on your plate. First, wash the chard, then cut the white-stemmed midribs from the green leaves either by cutting or pulling – as Jane Grigson notes in her Vegetable Book– sometimes scissors are best for doing this. Put the green leaves to one side. Cooking brings out sweetness and subdues the earthy-musty geosmins, as does béchamel, while chilli livens everything up. Stems and leaves reunited on your plate.

Set the greens aside. For the gratin, cut the midribs into 10cm lengths, stripping away any stringy bits, then cook in salted boiling water until tender. Warm the milk and clove-studded onion slowly over a low flame. In another pan, heat the butter until it starts to foam, whisk in the flour, then pull from the heat. Add a little of the milk and whisk to a smooth paste. Return the pan to the heat, and whisk in the remaining milk. When it almost boils, lower the heat and simmer, stirring frequently until the sauce is thick. Add three quarters of the parmesan and salt and pepper to taste. Layer the chard stalks in a shallow dish brushed with oil or melted butter. Pour the bechamel over and top the gratin with the remaining parmesan and breadcrumbs. Bake for 20 minutes, or until the top is golden and edges are bubbling. For the chard leaves with garlic and chilli, cut the leaves into thick ribbons. Put some olive oil, the garlic and chilli in the pan and fry gently for a minute, then add the leaves and stir until wilted. Continue cooking for five to 10 minutes, tasting and adding some more minced garlic you like.

3/14/2022,"Britons should brace for a rise in Covid infections after the easing of restrictions, the health secretary has said, as the latest figures show rates are increasing as people socialise more. Sajid Javid said the UK remained in a “very good position” but rising infection rates were to be “expected”. To reduce the risk of serious infection, he urged adults eligible for a booster vaccine to have one, given that one in five had not yet received it. The latest data from the Office for National Statistics Covid-19 Infections Survey showed an increase in cases across the whole of the UK. In the week ending 5 March, one in every 25 people in England, one in 13 in Northern Ireland, one in 18 in Scotland and one in 30 in Wales were estimated to have Covid-19. Asked about the newly identified Deltacron variant, which contains elements of Delta and Omicron, Javid told BBC Breakfast a “handful” of cases had been identified in the UK but were “not of particular concern”. About 99.9% of infections in Britain were of the Omicron variant, he said. Javid told Sky News: “We keep the situation very carefully under review. There’s no other variant of concern out there that is an issue at this point in time.” Javid told Times Radio that officials continued to monitor infections, case numbers, hospital admissions and capacities. “We’re the most open country in Europe and that’s happened because of the country’s approach and the British people’s approach to vaccination,” he said. “But also the support that we have from all the different treatments that the NHS is now able to offer and on our testing offer where we focus very much on the most vulnerable.” There were 72,898 cases of Covid-19 reported in the UK on Friday. On 24 February, when most of the remaining Covid-19 restrictions in England ended, there were 38,933 cases reported. There are also almost 12,000 people in hospital in the UK with Covid-19.",News/World news,"Britons should brace for rising Covid cases, says Sajid Javid",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/britons-should-brace-for-rising-covid-cases-says-sajid-javid-uk

3/14/2022,"‘“In the 60s, choreographer Yvonne Rainer came out with this whole manifesto: ‘No to spectacle, no to virtuosity ... ’” says Kevin Finnan, artistic director of Motionhouse dance company. Rainer’s No Manifesto continues: No to transformations and magic and make-believe … No to moving or being moved. “And the thing is,” says Finnan, “I don’t agree with any of that. I’m really fascinated with spectacle.” He’s in the right job, then. Finnan is a master of mass spectacle, huge outdoor performances featuring hundreds of dancers and acrobats, flying bicycles, skydivers, planes, boats and moving machinery. He’s created events for four different European Capital of Culture celebrations, built a giant ship in the middle of Birmingham for the Cultural Olympiad, and choreographed the Paralympics opening ceremony in London. His latest job is Wondrous Stories, which opens the Birmingham 2022 festivalin the run-up up to this year’s Commonwealth Games. The important thing is just that it’s not empty spectacle, says Finnan, “otherwise it’s a firework display”. He tries to “engage the audience with beauty and strength and virtuosity,” he says. “But there has to be a relationship with the simple and the human and what we’re trying to say.” Even the flashiest pageants have to respond to their settings and tap into something personal for the viewers. In Timisoara in western Romania, for example, Finnan drew on people’s memories of their city under communism, with a scene showing people going out at night and turning their TV aerials around to the west under cover of darkness. For Birmingham 2022, where the show takes place in Centenary Square, surrounded by a library, theatre, concert hall and a war memorial, Finnan decided this was a place all about storytelling and invited the public to send in their own stories about life in the region to be woven into the show. “Everybody here is a story themselves, and they’re worth listening to,” says Finnan. “It strikes me we’re living in a world where everybody’s shouting and not very many people are listening.” Around the heart of the show you can build the wow factor. Finnan’s learned a lot about what will capture the attention of hundreds of eyeballs. “Humans are interested in pattern,” he says, “and if you don’t see anything that strikes you as a pattern, you’re going to look away.” He gives the example of seeing a random collection of people on the street. But if you see one woman in a red coat, and then 30 seconds later you see someone else in a red coat, your brain hooks into that relationship. He also likes to have fun with props, the bigger or more unexpected the better. In Finnan’s first large-scale show, on Watergate Bay in Cornwall back in 2004, he brought in JCBs as performers and he’s used them frequently ever since. “I wanted to use the JCBs as bodies,” he says. “I was watching the drivers doing their thing, and they’re so skilled, they can be so graceful. They can pick up an egg with those things. I thought, ‘I’m going to make those machines dance with us.’” Imagination is only challenged by budget. “The thing you learn doing an Olympics is there’s never enough money,” laughs Finnan. “You might have £28m, you think, ‘Wow, that’s an enormous amount of money,’ but when you’ve got a sound system and crews building stages and 70,000 light-up electronic panels, suddenly you’re going, ‘I’m a bit short!’” That’s especially true right now. “What has happened to infrastructure costs since Covid and Brexit is just insane,” says Finnan. “It’s all 50% more. And all the technical staff have gone to telly.” There is no shortage of performers, though. The Birmingham 2022 show (which Finnan is making with associate choreographers Jamaal Burkmar and Sonia Sabri) will have a community cast of more than 250 people, and marshalling them all in the right direction can be trickier than choreographing mechanical diggers. Although with something as big as the Paralympics, there’s tech support. “Everybody performing has in-ear piece and it’s like Heathrow control room, you have a whole load of people at desks with mics going ‘1, 2, 3, 4, in two bars were going to turn …’” The impact for the participants in these giant shows can be even greater than the spectacle for everyone watching. That was especially true in the Paralympics. Finnan tells me about a severely disabled young man who took part in the opening with his mum. The choreography was devised around what the participants could do, and Finnan chokes up as he tells me that some months later the young man’s mother called him to say her son had died. “She said that the experience of doing it with him had been profound for her. She said it was the first time they had done anything together as equals. All of her group were going to get together and they wanted to do their dance at the funeral, because it was so meaningful to him, and to them. For me, the whole Olympics was worth it for that one moment.”  Wondrous Stories opens the Birmingham 2022 festival, 17-20 March.",Arts/Stage,"‘It’s like Heathrow control room’: creating Wondrous Stories, Birmingham 2022’s opening ceremony",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/14/its-like-heathrow-control-room-creating-wondrous-stories-birmingham-2022s-opening-ceremony

These are all parts of the story the artist tells herself while she’s working on her paintings. Whatever Jones has in mind, her work is largely improvised; a kind of painting as performance. There are things in her paintings I can’t experience and don’t have access to. Maybe this is true of all art. Most of the work in say cheeeeese at Chisenhale was completed in the gallery, as Jones worked on a group of small irregular paintings and on a big, wonky, irregularly shaped length of unstretched canvas. Other works were trimmed to size and tacked directly to both sides of a freestanding wall, and yet more are stretched and hung in the usual way. For the first time in many years the gallery windows have been exposed, letting the daylight in. Usually, Chisenhale is a darkened, concrete-floored bunker. Jones has enjoyed a rapid ascent. She was born in 1991 and brought up in London. Since leaving college in 2019 she has been picked up by the international Thaddaeus Ropac gallery, and was included in the Hayward’s Mixing It Up show last year. These and other exhibitions mark a swift move up from her first solo exhibition at the do-it-yourself London artist’s space Jupiter Woods just a few years ago. Things are happening everywhere all at once in say cheeeeese; larger things and smaller things, nothing ever quite complete but all of it coalescing into a kind of fractured all-over composition. This is familiar territory but Jones takes it to a place of her own. Every time I think I see a jumble of stuff come together into a figure – a bit of torso or a waist or an arm or a silhouette – it’s off again, running away from me. Is this a landscape with plants or a shirt patterned with foliage worn by someone walking through a flower market, or is it neither of these things? Was that a lemon that just went by? Are these puce-coloured knees and a stretch of belly under a halter top? A patch of snaggly brown drawing looks like an unravelling pattern on a jumper. Then come the seismographic judderings, a green turban, the face of a dog, though I may have imagined the dog. An area of ferocious green disintegrates against orangey red, hot ultramarine and cold cerulean blue, comic-book cells distorting like a car’s panels after a collision. I catch myself anthropomorphising and seeing pictures in the half-completed shapes. I am cued-in to look for the teeth, the lips, the flowers. I find parts of bodies where there might be none, and end up dismissing it all as my own projection. A little bit of this over here, a dabble of that over there. Fill up the corners or let them alone? Decisions, decisions. Let the process do the talking, follow the way the pastel grazes the nub of the primed canvas and goes all gravelly, and how the oil stick – like a giant lipsticky crayon – skids and slews about. Warming up as it glides, the oil stick lubricates its own journey across the canvas. Then we’re off again, carried by the scurrying, juddering pastel and oil-stick lines, which sometimes look like impatient indecipherable signatures and at other times like repetitive marks beating out a kind of rhythmic, looping tattoo, through powder-puff pinks and acid greens, flat colour and overlaid colour, shading and shuffling, scribbling and wrenching, wallowing and scrabbling. Clunky passages lead to fluid exuberance, and the execution is rapid and freeform, one thing leading to another, and then another. Areas of almost flat colour peter out at the edges or get outlined and reworked, the line straying off to describe sprays of foliage or the surface of water. Then we’re down in some sort of gulch, in a graveyard of tombstone teeth. Positive and negative space flip-flop and the drive and energy is palpable and contagious. If I’m not careful I’ll soon want to pick up a crayon and start doing it myself. But it’s a risky business, working like this. Go at it too hard and the whole thing could easily get clogged. Jones lets her hand lead the touches of oil-stick and pastel. The density and colour strength of her materials have a consistency across the surface, and there’s very little letup. The big question must be knowing when to stop. How does she know when she’s done? The overall effect is like watching an animation in which forms and shapes keep mutating in a kind of haptic stream of consciousness. I can imagine Jones’s art remade as tapestries or as hand-drawn animations. It all keeps coming at you and it could go on for ever. Perhaps what they feel like is the point. And you feel with your body, not just the eye. There is a sense that parts of one painting could easily migrate to another, signalling a sort of inexactitude. Then again, all the works here, large and small, have the same title, and they’re all part of the same improvised mashup. Less a show of paintings, more a DJ set, and none the worse for that.
