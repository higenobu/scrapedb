1/13/2022,"Have you ever wanted to revisit your first love? A better question: who hasn’t? Blue Jay explores this desire so precisely that it may as well be a time travel movie. It stars Mark Duplass and Sarah Paulson as Jim and Amanda, high school sweethearts who bump into each other a couple decades down the line in the town where they grew up. Neither lives there any more, but they have both returned home at key moments. Jim’s mother has died; Amanda’s sister is giving birth. When they lock eyes at the grocery store, an old flame is rekindled, and it still burns brightly.  At this point, many film-makers would have Jim and Amanda embark on a secret affair that disrupts their lives and wreaks havoc on their relationships, but Blue Jay is after something far less grand. Jim and Amanda go for coffee, and at the end of it, neither wants the conversation to end. They return to Jim’s childhood home, where, thanks to his mother’s hoarding tendencies, Jim’s teenage life remains trapped in amber. They look at old photos, chat openly about the past, and in an extended flight of nostalgia, play house for the evening, pretending that they stayed together after high school and are now a boring, married couple. Heavily improvised and filmed in lush black-and-white, Blue Jay is emotionally raw, giddily entertaining and draws exquisite tension from the possibility that if these two lonely souls stroll too far down memory lane, they may never find their way back. Confidently directed by Alex Lehmann, Blue Jay presents the kind of romance that was once a staple of Hollywood and has now gone woefully out of fashion. There was a time when film romance was fundamental to the industry. It was the way stars were built. Watching Ingrid Bergman fall in love with Humphrey Bogart during the flashbacks of Casablanca turned them both into major film stars. Bergman looked at him the way we all wish someone would look at us, and her gaze legitimized Bogart as a romantic hero. This doesn’t happen in cinema much any more. Hollywood has lost interest in romance and, either as a symptom or a cause, has failed to produce a dependable crop of movie stars for some time. If you look at their careers, you won’t mistake Duplass or Paulson for major film stars, but they feel like them in Blue Jay. Jim, a typical Duplass creation, is a strange, sensitive guy prone to fits of crying. “My face leaks,” he jokes awkwardly, the first time it happens. Paulson, adorable in her knit stocking cap, seems to have her life a little more together. She is married with two grown stepkids; Jim is an unemployed bachelor. Under normal circumstances, you wouldn’t expect she would have anything to do with him, but when she looks at him, the stars fill her eyes. You see it the first time she notices him in that grocery store. Her vulnerability makes her beautiful, while her attraction to him makes us hold him in higher esteem. You know, the way cinema worked for a hundred years before the teenagers took over. Still, what makes Blue Jay so poignant is how it creates a space for the purity of first love to be fully felt by processing it through the weariness of middle age. In the film’s best scene, Jim and Amanda sit at opposite ends of his childhood bed, where they presumably shared more than one special evening. They listen to a cassette tape they made as kids, in which they improvise gangsta rap. The glances they share could inspire a volume of poems. They rejoice, they regret, they rekindle, all in the same breath. It’s a rich moment of cinema that shows without telling, and implies without explaining. On that score, Blue Jay sputters a bit towards the end – it eventually points to a single cause for their post-high school rupture, when it should have left the past ambiguous – for most of its runtime it is an irresistible cocktail that gives you the buzz of young love with none of the hangover. By the end, your face will be leaking.

1/13/2022,"The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has suggested Novak Djokovic will not be allowed to stay in the country and contest the Australian Open unless he can substantiate a medical exemption allowing him to be unvaccinated against Covid. Speaking before any formal decision by the immigration minister, Alex Hawke, Morrison on Thursday refused to comment directly on Djokovic’s case, but said he expected authorities “to implement the policy of the government” to only allow fully vaccinated people or those with medical exemptions into Australia.  Djokovic received a visa on 18 November and arrived in Melbourne on 5 January with an exemption approved by Tennis Australia’s chief medical officer and a Victorian government independent expert panel. However, Djokovic was detained and his visa cancelled on the basis a recent Covid infection by itself was not sufficient for an exemption from Australia’s strict vaccination requirements. Although Djokovic won a court battle on Monday to restore the visa, he faces a nervous wait as Hawke decides whether to exercise a separate power to again cancel it. On Thursday, Morrison referred to a statement from Hawke on Wednesday that the immigration minister was still considering whether to cancel Djokovic’s visa. But the prime minister also said that people coming to Australia – such as working holiday-makers – must be double vaccinated to enter the country. Asked whether non-citizen non-residents who are not double vaccinated were a risk to public health, Morrison skirted around Djokovic’s case by referring to “other matters being considered at the moment”. “All I will simply say is the reason we have had since 15 December, where fully vaccinated eligible visa holders could travel to Australia without needing to apply for a travel exemption … that individual has to show they are double vaccinated or must provide acceptable proof that they can’t be vaccinated for medical reasons,” he said. “That’s the policy, that policy hasn’t changed … of course we would expect authorities to be implementing the policy of the government when it comes to those matters.” Morrison noted that non-citizen non-residents could have acquired a visa but that did not guarantee that they fulfilled conditions to enter the country. “They may have acquired a visa recently, they may have acquired a visa some time ago and be returning, when some of these issues weren’t extant at that time,” he said. “That’s why it’s important to distinguish between the visa and the condition to enter the border. They’re not one and the same thing and they’re often conflated and shouldn’t be. “If you’re not a citizen or resident, then the health rules we have in place to protect our borders [apply] – and our border protection policies have been central to the government’s achievements when it comes [to covid] and Australia’s achievements generally in having one of the lowest death rates.” On Wednesday, Djokovic conceded his agent made an “administrative mistake” when declaring he had not travelled in the two weeks before his flight to Australia and acknowledged an “error of judgment” by not isolating in Belgrade after he tested positive for Covid on 16 December.",Sport/Sport,Novak Djokovic: Australia still considering cancelling player’s visa and whether he had ‘acceptable proof’,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/13/novak-djokovic-australia-considering-cancel-visa-tennis-2022-australian-open

1/13/2022,"Australia’s “backwards” positions on global heating and asylum seekers are becoming increasingly unacceptable to the world, a leading human rights group says. Human Rights Watch launched its annual world report on Thursday, again finding “serious human rights issues” in Australia, despite its overall record as a strong, multicultural democracy.  For the first time, Human Rights Watch focused on climate, an area where Australia was found particularly wanting. The report criticised Australia’s per capita emissions, among the worst in the globe, its huge exports of fossil fuels, and the tax breaks afforded to fossil fuel companies, which have increased 48% since the Paris agreement in 2015. The report yet again slammed Australia’s treatment of asylum seekers and refugees, including those transferred to Australia and detained in hotel rooms for extended periods, where “access to sunlight, space to exercise, and fresh air is limited”. The plight of asylum seekers was given recent global exposure by the short-term detention of tennis star Novak Djokovic. Australia’s rates of Indigenous incarceration – accounting for 30% of all adult prisoners, despite making up just 3% of the general population – and the at least 11 deaths in custody last year were also condemned. The report included the shocking statistic that Indigenous children are 17 times more likely to be imprisoned than non-Indigenous children, and criticised Australia for ignoring calls by 31 United Nations member states to raise the age of criminal responsibility to the internationally recommended minimum of 14. The tough travel restrictions introduced during the pandemic were also highlighted. The report said the decision to deny Australians from returning home was a “punitive approach to travel that left tens of thousands of Australian families separated from their loved ones”. Human Rights Watch highlighted the inconsistent approaches taken to Australians living in India after the wave in May last year, compared to those living in the US and the UK after similar spikes. “Strict and inflexible domestic travel restrictions inside Australia left families separated and others unable to return home, with individuals refused permission to travel across state borders for compassionate reasons or medical treatment, despite willingness to abide by quarantine restrictions,” the report said. Human Rights Watch Australia researcher, Sophie McNeill, said the world increasingly struggled to comprehend why Australia took such “backwards” stances on issues like climate and asylum seekers. “Increasingly, the rest of the world and Australians are just saying ‘this is unacceptable, we can’t continue like this’,” McNeill told Guardian Australia. “We’re now seeing that with Australia’s climate policy, you’re increasingly getting that realisation around the world how backwards Australia is on this. The Djokovic issue has also reminded us that we’re also this way on asylum seekers.” Human Rights Watch’s report said universities in Australia were failing to protect the academic freedom of students who spoke out about China and academics who criticised the Communist party. This, the report said, left them “vulnerable to harassment and intimidation by Chinese government supporters”. “Chinese pro-democracy students in Australia alter their behaviour and self-censor to avoid threats and harassment from fellow classmates and being ‘reported on’ by them to authorities back home,” the report said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The report also cited the work of the disability royal commission and its criticisms of the slow Covid vaccine rollout for people with disabilities. It similarly cited the aged care royal commission, saying the pandemic had highlighted “systemic understaffing and gaps in regulation”. “Many aged care facilities use dangerous drugs, often without informed consent, to control the behaviour of older people with dementia,” the report said. “The government has not banned the practice and has not conducted sufficient monitoring of facilities’ compliance with existing regulations.”",News/Australia news,"Australia’s stances on climate crisis and asylum seekers ‘backwards’, Human Rights Watch says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/13/australias-stances-on-climate-crisis-and-asylum-seekers-backwards-human-rights-watch-says
1/13/2022,"An extremely rare, carved wooden figure from the early Roman era has been unearthed in a waterlogged ditch in Buckinghamshire, the latest extraordinary find in the UK’s biggest ever archaeological dig along the 150-mile HS2 rail route. The 67cm-tall figure is carved from a single piece of wood. Archaeologists said its preservation was “incredible” given its age and material, but the lack of oxygen in the ditch helped prevent rotting over many centuries.  “This is a truly remarkable find which brings us face to face with our past. The quality of the carving is exquisite and the figure is all the more exciting because organic objects from this period rarely survive,” said Jim Williams, a senior science adviser for Historic England. The figure, found in a field near Twyford, is wearing a knee-length tunic that seems to be gathered at the waist. It may be wearing a hat, or have styled hair, and has well-defined legs, although the feet and the arms below the elbows have degraded. More than 1,000 archaeologists have been working on at least 60 separate sites along the HS2 phase one route between London and Birmingham since autumn 2018. Experts have said the project is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to shed light on 10,000 years of history. The route was initially mapped by laser scanning and geophysical surveys before digs began. Archaeological investigation is a legally binding condition of the HS2 project, and is funded as part of the overall budget, estimated in 2019 at £45bn for phase one. Among the finds ranging from the iron age to the Victorian era is the discovery revealed earlier this week of a vast Roman settlement in Northamptonshire, 16th-century gardens in Warwickshire, the world’s oldest railway roundhouse in Birmingham, a trio of Roman statues at an abandoned medieval church in Buckinghamshire, and tens of thousands of skeletons at various burial grounds. “The scale of the HS2 project is unprecedented, so it’s not surprising that spectacular discoveries have been made,” said Mike Pitts, editor of British Archaeology. “It’s the fruits of Britain’s thousands of years of continuous occupation and our skilled archaeological workforce.” Alice Roberts, presenter of the BBC programme Digging for Britain, said the “extraordinary finds” along the HS2 route showed how rich the archaeological landscape of the country was. “This is the biggest archaeological investigation we’ve ever seen in Britain and you can’t overstate the importance of it,” she said. Objects that have been unearthed will be preserved and many will eventually be displayed in museums. But larger finds, such as the 10 metre-wide Roman road in Northamptonshire, will be bulldozed to make way for HS2. Helen Wass, HS2’s head of heritage, said: “Archaeology is a double-edged sword. We wouldn’t be doing it if construction wasn’t happening. You can’t have one without the other. We make sure that if construction happens, we record our heritage to the best of our ability.” The cost of the HS2 archaeological work is built into the project’s overall budget, but Wass declined to say how much it had cost so far. Fieldwork on phase one is expected to be completed by the end of 2022, but post-excavation analysis will take several more years, she said. The carved wooden figure was “a fantastic find”, said Pitt. “It’s really rare to get Roman carved woodwork in Britain. Even in its fractured, weathered state, it has something in the pose of the figure and in the dress that says this is probably Roman.” The figure will undergo analysis and conservation at York Archaeology. A fragment that was found broken off in the ditch will be radiocarbon-dated to establish an accurate date for the wood.",News/Science,‘Exquisite’ Roman figure found on HS2 dig in Buckinghamshire,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/13/exquisite-roman-figure-found-on-hs2-dig-in-buckinghamshire
1/13/2022,"After two years, there is light at the end of the Covid-19 tunnel. Daily recorded cases of the Omicron variant are falling and it seems likely plan B restrictions will be eased in England at the end of the month. Nicola Sturgeon has relaxed the 500-person limit on mass gatherings in Scotland. The return of life to something approaching normal ought to be unalloyed good news for the government. After all, the pandemic has resulted in the economy shrinking by almost a tenth in 2020, sending public borrowing to a peacetime record.  In fact, the waning of Covid-19 as an issue may make life more rather than less difficult for Boris Johnson, because it will allow people to focus on everything else that it going on. They will be free to contemplate a 50% increase in their energy bills in April, an increase in taxes, and prices rising faster than wages. Chuck in higher interest rates from the Bank of England and it is not hard to see why even Tory-supporting publications have been warning about a cost-of-living crisis. Warren Buffett, the veteran US investor, once said that it’s only when the tide goes out that you see who’s been swimming naked, and rarely has that maxim seemed more apt. Even though the economy will continue to grow this year, for many voters 2022 is going to feel more like a recession year than 2020 did. It is taking the government a long time to realise the political peril this represents, particularly at a time when public anger over the parties at Downing Street is palpable. Labour has been running hard with its “them and us” attack on the prime minister over adherence to lockdown rules, but it now has the opportunity to mount the same argument on the economy: the rich are benefiting from soaring house and share prices, while those struggling to get by will be clobbered by an increase in national insurance contributions and £600 a year on the average household’s fuel bills. At the height of the pandemic, it was hard for Labour to get a hearing on the economy. Nobody was really interested in what the main opposition party had to say during a health emergency; and, in any case, Labour was broadly supportive of the measures taken to prevent lockdowns leading to mass unemployment. That’s now changing. In part, that’s because money is no longer gushing out of the Treasury at the rate it was. Rishi Sunak announced £1bn extra for hospitality firms in December, but previously decided not to continue with the £20 a week uplift to universal credit announced at the start of the pandemic and insisted on a national insurance (NI) increase to pay for extra spending on the NHS and social care. Both those decisions – controversial at the time – look even more questionable in the light of the subsequent jump in global energy costs, a price shock reminiscent of the 1970s. But in part, too, the government’s delay in responding to demands for consumers to be shielded from looming price rises has allowed Labour to fill the vacuum. Its plan includes a temporary cut in VAT, consumers not being expected to pick up the tab for the costs of the more than 20 energy companies that have recently gone bust, and a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas to help pay for an expanded and more generous warm home discount – the help with bills provided to those on low incomes. Under Labour’s proposals around one-third of UK households would see virtually no increase in their bills next year. There would be something off bills for everyone, with extra help for those who need it most. It is quite hard for the government to push back against Labour’s ideas. The prime minister himself said during the EU referendum campaign that one of the benefits of Brexit would be the freedom to set our own VAT rates, and the first Thatcher government imposed a North Sea windfall tax in 1980. Accusing Labour of being the party of tax and spend has its difficulties for the Conservatives, given that taxes are on course to be their highest since Clement Attlee was prime minister. Whether the energy crisis represents Keir Starmer’s breakthrough moment remains to be seen. The good news for the government is that unemployment is low and inflation is expected to fall back later in the year after peaking in the spring. The bad news is that the time-honoured Conservative way of ramping up the economy – a house-price boom – is not an option because the property market is already red hot. While the main focus of Labour’s attacks has been the prime minister, the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has also been accusing Sunak of going missing in action. Reeves clearly thinks the chancellor is looking vulnerable, which indeed he is. Two years of Covid have not fundamentally changed the basic rules of politics. Governments thrive when wages are rising faster than prices and living standards are going up. They struggle when the opposite is the case. Opinion polls suggest “red wall” voters are angered not just by Johnson’s flouting of lockdown rules but also by his failure to deliver on his levelling-up agenda. Given the squeeze on family budgets, there has rarely been a more opportune moment for Labour to propose an alternative to NI increases: wealth taxes on the rich.

1/13/2022,"The police and crime bill is a huge piece of legislation covering many aspects of the criminal justice system. One of its most controversial sections would have a big impact on the right to protest  In general if the police want to place restrictions on a protest, they have to show it may result in “serious public disorder, serious damage to property or serious disruption to the life of the community”. They can also impose specific measures on the routes of marches. When it comes to major events, such details are typically thrashed out with the organisers weeks in advance and they can try to obtain injunctions from the high court. Among the most controversial elements are new powers for the home secretary to ban marches and demonstrations because they believe they might be “seriously disruptive”, including being too noisy. There are also plans for a new criminal offence of obstructing roads, railways, airports, oil refineries and printing presses, carrying a maximum penalty of 12 months in prison. Protesters who attach themselves to another person or object face a potential 51 weeks in prison, and “serious disruption prevention orders” would allow authorities to ban named individuals – including those without any convictions – from participating in demonstrations or even using the internet to encourage others to do so. Police would have more control over where and when demonstrations took place, and extended stop and search powers would allow officers to target people and vehicles if they suspect they might be carrying anything that could be used in protests. A new offence of damage to memorials or statues could lead to up to 10 years in prison Critics have described the bill as an unprecedented power grab by the state, which would make many forms of protest difficult or impossible. In policy papers, the government is explicit that the new measures are a response to Extinction Rebellion’s hugely disruptive protest campaigns in London in 2019, as well as Black Lives Matter protests the following year. Late-stage amendments tabled by the government in November were widely understood to be intended as a legal crackdown on Insulate Britain’s actions. The home secretary, Priti Patel, has insisted peaceful protest remains a “cornerstone of democracy,” but argues there has been a “significant change in protest tactics … with protesters exploiting gaps in the law which have led to disproportionate amounts of disruption”. The Home Office says the new measures will help plug those gaps allowing police to deal more effectively with demonstrators set on causing serious disruption and inconvenience to the public. As well as protest and civil liberty groups, 350 charities have signed a letter and more than 800,000 people have signed a petition calling for the bill to be scrapped. In addition 700 academics have come out against the proposals and parliament’s joint committee on human rights said the proposals are “oppressive and wrong”. Two former home secretaries have also criticised the plans with David Blunkett saying the measures risks making the UK “more like Putin’s Russia”, and would “leave a bad taste in the mouths of British people who value tolerance, democracy and open debate”. In short, yes. Critics say among the issues of most concern are new powers of stop and search that are likely to hit minority communities hardest, and the provision that turns trespass from a civil into a criminal offence, will allow police to arrest people who are Gypsies, Roma and Travellers and confiscate their homes, if they stop in places that have not been designated for them.",News/Law,How will the police and crime bill limit the right to protest?,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jan/13/how-will-the-police-and-bill-limit-the-right-to-protest
1/13/2022,"Climate activist groups are urging the Labour party to oppose a policing bill they say will undermine the right to protest at a critical moment in the fight to avoid climate breakdown. Youth campaigners have joined other environment and climate justice groups, from Greenpeace to Extinction Rebellion, to call on the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, to whip his MPs and peers to vote against the police and crime bill, which they say is a “devastating attack on our democratic right to be heard on the issues that matter most to us”.  Fatima Ibrahim, from the youth climate movement Green New Deal Rising, said young people worried about the climate crisis “desperately need to be able to protest … to hold our leaders to account. Instead, this bill aims to put limits on public campaigning, pulling power away from people and further concentrating in the hands of a few.” Freya Tischkowitz, 18, one of the organisers of the UK school strike movement, in which hundreds of thousands of young climate protesters took to the streets before the Covid pandemic, described the bill as “absolutely terrifying”. “The absurdity of this situation never fails to hit me – how, instead of deciding to listen to what we and the scientists are saying about how we need to radically change course to avert climate catastrophe, the British government decides the best thing to do is to lock us all up to avoid us ruining its image as a ‘global climate leader’.” Lords began voting on amendments to some of the most controversial aspects of the bill on Monday, with more debate on Wednesday. Next Monday, peers will vote on last-minute government amendments that human rights activists have described as “a dangerous power grab”. With the amendments likely to fail if the lords vote them down, the stage is set for a potential showdown with the government – if Labour also opposes them. Meanwhile, activist pressure against the bill has been building. The Kill the Bill coalition, which is supported by activist groups, trade unions and civil rights organisations, has called a “national day of action” on Saturday, with protests expected in London and elsewhere. On Monday, when the crucial votes take place on government amendments, the comedian Mark Thomas and others have called for a “really annoying demonstration”, poking fun at measures that would introduce 10-year sentences for causing “serious annoyance” to the public. “As the House of Lords debates the bill, bring banjos, Piers Morgan masks, crying children, vuvuzelas, cancelled buses and slow-walking tourists,” the call to protest said. “Anything that is annoying and/or loud!” The bill has been widely opposed by human rights activists, racial justice groups, former home secretaries and parliament’s joint committee on human rights, which said the proposals were “oppressive and wrong”. Critics say it is an unprecedented power grab by the state and a reaction, in part, to increasing civil disobedience by climate groups such as Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain. In the bill’s current form experts say there are a raft of measures that would make many forms of protest difficult or impossible. They include:  New powers for the home secretary to ban marches and demonstrations because the authorities believe they may be “seriously disruptive”, including being too noisy.  A new criminal offence of obstructing key national infrastructure, such as roads, railways, seaports, airports, oil refineries and printing presses, carrying a maximum penalty of 12 months in prison.  Sentences of up to 51-weeks for protesters who attach themselves, or lock on to, another person or to an object.  “Serious disruption prevention orders” that would allow authorities to ban named individuals, including those without any convictions, from participating in demonstrations or even using the internet to encourage others to do so.  New police stop-and-search powers allowing officers tostop people or vehicles if they suspect they may be carrying any article that could be used in protests.  A new offence of damage to memorials or statues that could lead to up to 10 years in prison. John Sauven, executive director at Greenpeace, said: “As it stands, this bill gives the government unprecedented sweeping powers to restrict everyone’s right to stand up for what they believe in. If ministers can dictate where and when you can assemble, who’s allowed to attend and how much noise they can make, your right to protest becomes a sham … We might as well have the home secretary write the placards herself.” A joint petition opposing the bill organised by a coalition of charities has been signed by more than 750,000 people. But activists say Labour has the chance to vote down some of the most controversial aspects of the bill, contained in the amendments, when the legislation comes before the Lords this month. That is because, unlike the rest of the legislation, where peers can merely send amendments back to the Commons to be reconsidered, the amendments were introduced in the Lords, so they will “fall” if peers vote against them. Sauven said: “The opposition now has the perfect opportunity to block the worst parts of it in the Lords. The Labour leadership should seize this chance and whip their peers to vote against it.” Ibrahim agreed that opposition parties must unite to challenge the bill. “All opposition parties, and especially the Labour party, should be speaking out strongly against this bill, whipping representatives in both houses to vote against it now.” Zoë Blackler, from Extinction Rebellion, which has staged a series of high-profile disruptive civil disobedience actions in the past two and a half years, said its protests would continue, whatever new measures the government introduced. She said Labour had a choice to make. “How Labour votes on this bill will be a test of Starmer’s leadership. He can look away and enable Johnson and Patel’s shameless power grab. Or he can stand firm against an incompetent government trying to silence its critics.” The Labour party and the Home Office did not respond to requests for comment.",News/World news,‘Oppressive and wrong’: green activists urge Labour to vote against policing bill,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/13/green-activists-urge-labour-to-vote-against-policing-bill-climate-catastrophe
1/13/2022,"Visiting the International Fair of Dakar is like taking a stroll through the ruins of some ancient Toblerone-worshipping civilisation. A cluster of triangular pavilions rises from a podium, each clad in a rich pattern of seashells and pebbles. These are reached by triangular steps that lead past triangular plant pots to momentous triangular entranceways. All around, great hangar-like sheds extend into the distance, ventilated by triangular windows and topped with serrated triangular roofs. All that’s missing is triangular honey from triangular bees. Built on the outskirts of the Senegalese capital as a showcase for global trade in 1974, this astonishing city-sized hymn to the three-sided shape was designed by young French architects Jean Francois Lamoureux, Jean-Louis Marin and Fernand Bonamy. Their obsessive geometrical composition was an attempt to answer the call of Senegal’s first president, the poet Léopold Sédar Senghor, for a national style that he curiously termed “asymmetrical parallelism”.  After the country gained independence from France in 1960, Senghor was determined to use the arts to forge a new national identity, liberated from western tradition and drawing from African civilisation, particularly Sudano-Sahelian traditions, “without wavering from the requirements of modernity”. Senghor never quite defined what this brave new style should look like, but he spoke vaguely of “a diversified repetition of rhythm in time and space”. Forceful, faceted forms and strong, rhythmic geometries became the vogue. Dakar is home to numerous structures that attempt to meet Senghor’s ambitions. The international fair complex is the most spectacular, its composition loosely nodding towards a nomadic desert settlement of tent-like forms, dotted with everything from animal horns and shells to clay pipes and gnarled volcanic rocks. It is in a sorry state, although a Getty-funded conservation project is currently under way, and it is still possible to see how it attempted to forge a bold new path, combining modern techniques with indigenous traditions, creating an expressive, sculptural language rooted in its context. Many such projects feature in the Atlantic coast volume of Sub-Saharan Africa, an immense new architectural guide that brings together a staggering collection of more than 850 buildings from 49 countries within 3,400 pages. Seven years in the making, the publication provides an illuminating cross-section of the continent, from the glittering skyscrapers of oil-rich Luanda in Angola to the mud mosques of Mali and the art deco buildings of Burundi. It boasts more than 350 authors, half with African roots. Philipp Meuser, co-editor of the guide, writes of how, on the one hand, “glossy magazines featuring Africa normally show safari lodges with pseudo-ethnic architecture, or fancy resorts located on expanses of long sandy beaches” or, on the other, “reports on over-population and lack of education and healthcare”. But there is hardly any reporting on everyday architecture, offering a “real” picture of African cities. While by no means comprehensive, the guide aims to fill part of that void, combining descriptions of historic, vernacular and contemporary buildings, considering them against the background of race, gender and power, be it colonial, neocolonial or local. On a recent visit to Dakar, the book was an invaluable companion to help understand the jumbled urban fabric of the chaotic coastal capital. One curious confection looked like a fantastical postmodern interpretation of Sahelian mud architecture, with curved rocket-like obelisks projecting from its corners, painted a rich rusty red, and rain spouts echoing the overhanging wooden beams of vernacular mud construction. This is the Institute of Social Hygiene, which was actually designed by the architect Henry Adenot in the 1930s, when the French colonial authorities ditched their usual beaux arts style and attempted to adapt buildings to local contexts in the name of cultural integration. Any local inspiration was usually surface-deep: in this case, the ochre-coloured walls are made of reinforced concrete, but painted to look like sun-dried earth. In Senegal, French architects mainly drew inspiration from Sudanese and Moroccan styles – made popular by international expositions in Europe – ignoring the local architecture of the Wolof, Serer, or Fulani peoples.It is the postcolonial architecture of the 1970s and 80s that really stands out for its originality, much of it by Senegalese architects Cheikh Ngom and Pierre Goudiaby Atepa, as well as France’s Henri Chomette. They all developed a distinctive form of modernism in tune with President Senghor’s ideas of asymmetrical parallelism. Monolithic tapering pillars, often in rough-textured concrete, support powerful chiselled volumes, with an inventive use of pebbles, rocks and shells to add a tactile, rugged texture to the almost primitivist forms. Dakar’s Cheikh Anta Diop University is one of the best places to see this kind of work. One cluster of lecture theatres, designed by Chomette and Roland Depret in 1976, comprises five white, curved, windowless structures raised on textured brick plinths, arranged around a kind of village courtyard. As you get closer, you realise that the bobbly white surfaces are made from painted seashells, while the streaked brickwork is designed to evoke tree bark. You step up from the courtyard into the enigmatic white cocoons, which house steeply raked lecture halls sunk into the ground. The faculty of law and political science, by Cheikh Ngom, has an equally striking presence. Its knobbly red lava rock walls – covered with a sort of supersized volcanic pebbledash – are flanked by tapering buttress-like fins, rendered in textured sandy concrete, opening up to reveal a shady open-air lobby full of spaces to sit and chat out of the sun. The buildings of this era show a much more sensitive approach to the local climate than recent developments, with brise-soleil screens, deep-set windows and large overhangs to allow as much passive cooling as possible. It is notable that Dakar’s two recent trophy projects – the Chinese-built grand theatre and the Museum of Black Civilisations – share a could-be-anywhere aesthetic and have to be entirely air conditioned. Both are the doing of Abdoulaye Wade, Senegal’s president from 2000 to 2012, who had a penchant for oversized cultural baubles he could put his name on. The most gargantuan looms above the city on a hill to the west, in the form of the magnificently kitsch African Renaissance Monument. Featuring a ripped topless man and his copiously bosomed, scantily clad wife, complete with pointing baby held aloft, the 49-metre-tall bronze statue was made by North Korean sculptors at a cost of $30m (£22m). Taller than the Statue of Liberty, it has been widely ridiculed as a symbol of the vain profligacy of the former president, who claims intellectual property over the monument and still receives 35% of the income from ticket sales. Many Dakarois appear to share the view of the late Senegalese master sculptor Ousmane Sow, who lambasted the statue as “aesthetically childish and banal in the extreme”. Still, once you’ve climbed the 200 steps up to its base, it provides a great vantage point to admire the teeming city below. It’s easy to think Dakar’s architectural golden age is long gone, given the quality of what is now being built – and the fact that the only official architecture school closed in 1991. Many structures from the post-independence era have been demolished or mutilated beyond recognition. Chomette’s striking Hotel Independence, which once stood as a great vertical beehive facing on to the city’s central square, was recently stripped to the bone, its sculptural hooded window shades amputated and the remaining shell smothered in cheap grey cladding. But the guide offers a glimmer of hope from a new generation of young architects and engineers rediscovering vernacular techniques. I hadn’t given my hotel, the Djoloff, a moment’s thought until I found its extension listed in the guide as an example of the revival of compressed earth bricks. The seven-storey structure was built by Doudou Dème, who studied earth engineering in Grenoble before returning to Senegal to establish his company, Elementerre, in 2010. In a nation addicted to concrete, where cement bricks are cast on site for practically every kind of building, Dème and his peers face an uphill struggle. But the benefits of his earth bricks – which are low-carbon and highly insulating – are clear, especially as he combines them with organic typha insulation panels. Providing thermal comfort and regulating humidity, they make air conditioning obsolete. We may yet see a future of planet-friendly asymmetrical earthen parallelism.",Arts/Art and design,Tented love: how Senegal created a spectacular new African architecture,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/13/tented-love-senegal-spectacular-new-african-architecture-dakar-tent
1/13/2022,"Well, here’s a funny little curio to take your mind off everything for a bit. The House, produced by UK-based Nexus Studios and streamed by Netflix, is an adult stop-motion anthology special. Three stories of roughly half an hour each are set in the same house in different eras. The first two have a spooky twist, the third is a more straightforward if dystopian tale. In the interests of full disclosure, I am firmly in the camp of those who find stop-motion animation quite spooky enough without adding intentional frights. The slight herky-jerky nature of the movement is a constant reminder of the endless unseen positioning and repositioning that goes on. It speaks to my darkest terror – that we have no free will at all and are indeed just playthings to unseen gods, posing us here, there and everywhere for nothing more than their sport. We’re all just puppets, d’you see? Puppets with illusory notions of freedom and independence. Do you see yet? Do you see?  I’m sorry. Where was I? Ninety-minute, three-part stop-motion special The House. OK. The first and by far the most successful of the trio is directed (using bulbous-headed felted figures that – even without my particular terrors – stand somewhere on the line between thoroughly charming and thoroughly disquieting) by Belgian auteurs Emma De Swaef and Marc James Roels and set roughly around the turn of the last century. An impoverished family is persuaded to move home by architect’s emissary Mr Thomas, who is voiced by master of oddity Mark Heap (and whose presence adds a further ineffably unsettling touch for all those who recognise the reedy tones that have never once portended good). They move from their little home to a much grander, specially designed, fully furnished affair built on a nearby hilltop, where every modern convenience is supplied – lights come on automatically as it gets dark, all meals are provided. You don’t have to have recently watched the BBC’s thriller The Girl Before to get a bad feeling about this, but it helps. Sure enough, it soon emerges that even in Edwardian-ish times there is no such thing a free breakfast, lunch or tea. The house will exact a price. The parents (voiced by Matthew Goode and Claudie Blakley) quickly become enslaved by its dark spirit (or that of its owner, whose shadowy face is occasionally superimposed over the whole – you know the drill). Their young daughter, Mabel (Mia Goth), remains unaffected, but the malevolent house transforms around her so she cannot reach her entranced parents in time to save them from the raging conflagration that finally consumes them. There is nothing narratively innovative here, but enchanted parents, the disbelieved or unheard child and the inability to reach safety – however many corridors you run down and corners you turn – are perennially effective nightmare tropes, and to have them rendered in this way adds a novelty that refreshes them. And the design, the overall aesthetic, is wonderful. It’s a toss-up between which of the remaining two is less rewarding. In the one directed by Niki Lindroth von Bahr, the house is being renovated in the present by an embattled developer (voiced by Jarvis Cocker). We first meet him while he is trying to attract further investment and to repel an invasion of “fur beetles” (this time the characters are anthropomorphised animals – the Developer, who is given no other name, is a rat). His troubles multiply when a pair of supposed potential buyers who come to the open house event refuse to leave. They are soon joined by a host of other friends and relatives. The final scenes reveal the Developer with his spirit well and truly broken. But the story is too underbaked to deliver any real horrors or work as a fable about violation, or capitalism or any of the other themes it seems at various moments to be nodding vaguely at. The last, directed by Paloma Baeza, finds Rosa (a cat-figure, this time voiced by Susan Wokoma) engaged in a futile battle to restore the house as the flood waters of the future inexorably rise around it. She has tenants, played by Helena Bonham Carter and Will Sharpe, but they pay her in fish and crystals - unacceptable currencies to the plumbers and electricians she would like to employ. One by one, her tenants leave to find a safer berth elsewhere and eventually she is persuaded to leave too. This final third is a very, very slight affair. If the content of the stories had matched the painstaking form, the anthology could have been rather a groundbreaking success. As it is, the architects need to go back to the drawing board.

1/13/2022,"Care homes are missing a third of the staff they need and more than one in four have closed their doors to new admissions in a deepening labour crisis that is “putting safety and dignity at risk”. With thousands of care workers off sick with Covid on top of a rising number of vacancies, the situation in social care has become “grim, difficult and relentless”, according to the National Care Forum (NCF), which ran a survey of its not-for-profit care-home members.  Omicron absences are running at 14% on top of an 18% vacancy rate – a sharp increase on estimates before the pandemic – as beleaguered care workers quit jobs, often for better paying roles in retail or warehouses. The picture is even worse for domiciliary care, with two-thirds of providers forced to decline families’ new requests for help because they are short of carers. The executive director of the NCF, Vic Rayner, said the worsening situation showed the government’s approach to tackling the problem of staff shortages by giving social care “crumbs from the table” was negligent. We “have been highlighting the growing shortages in the workforce and the knock-on impact on those who remain working in the sector and those who use care and support services for many months”, she said. “How many times does this message need to be repeated for it to be heard?” The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has provided councils with additional funds to pay bonuses to retain staff, and late last month it extended the visa programme for foreign workers to care workers, care assistants and home-care workers. Such measures, however, are yet to fill widening gaps in the workforce. The figures came as MPs and peers were told that staff shortages in social care had worsened the lives of people who live in care homes and increased the risk of undernourishment and dehydration. The director of the Relatives and Residents Association, Helen Wildbore, also told a hearing into restriction on care home visiting by parliament’s joint committee on human rights that “untold harm is being done to lives and to wellbeing”. She said care residents “are being left behind while the rest of the country gets back to normal … if this is what the government meant by that protective ring then it is suffocating”. She said staff shortages were “putting safety and dignity at risk”. The director of Age UK, Caroline Abrahams, said short-staffing meant it was harder for residents to get fed and watered. “It can make a huge difference to help people eat and drink and it can be very pleasurable, but you can’t do it if you’re a care provider and you haven’t got the staff,” she said. The NCF’s snapshot of staff shortages was taken from care providers who together look after 130,000 people. It suggests official figures on staff absences may be underestimates. Live figures on Monday from internal health system capacity data seen by the Guardian showed 122 operators had declared a red alert on staffing, with 13,500 care workers off with Covid in England. A DHSC spokesperson said: “Care staff are working incredibly hard, and to strengthen the workforce we have provided £462.5m for recruitment and retention, expanded the health and care visa scheme, and are running our Made with Care recruitment campaign.”",News/Society,"Staffing at UK care homes 30% less than needed, survey finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/13/staffing-at-uk-care-homes-30-less-than-needed-survey-finds
1/13/2022,"Who on earth wants fish tank wastewater, chicken poo, tumble-dryer lint, loo roll tubes, “a plaster mould of a Komodo dragon’s foot” or half a broken toilet? No one, you might think, but the Buy Nothing community begs to differ: these are all real “gifts” snapped up by more than 5 million members worldwide, who give away their unwanted items in the local community. It’s living proof that “one person’s trash is another’s treasure”, as Alisa Miller, the administrator of the Blackheath/Charlton/Lewisham group puts it. Miller offered her daughter’s broken toy birdcage with little hope anyone would want it; it was snapped up by a local flower-arranging enthusiast, and filled with succulents and trailing plants. Her co-administrator’s son is the current custodian of a toy helicopter that has been played with by five Buy Nothing families to date. Members ask for what they want and usually get it: anything from household appliances, furniture and gardening tools to clothes and baby gear.  There is nothing unique or original about giving and getting stuff for free. It’s a practice as old as humanity. The juggernaut giveaway network Freecycle was founded in 2003 – but what distinguishes the Buy Nothing project from Freecycle, Freegle, Olio and their ilk is that the emphasis is less on stuff, per se, and more on community. In what Buy Nothing describes as its “hyperlocal gift economies”, users are encouraged to let items “simmer” rather than giving them away to the first person who asks, perhaps suggesting they share a joke or provide a story explaining why they would like the item. In addition to “gifts” and “asks”, users are encouraged to post “gratitude”, with a message or a picture showing what a gifted item has meant to them. That could all sound insufferably twee, but the thinking behind it is fairly radical. It’s a “social experiment”, explain the project’s founders, Rebecca Rockefeller and Liesl Clark, from their respective living rooms in Washington state, effecting a fundamental shift in our attitude to material goods by building a sense of community, and treating items as community-owned and shared. “If you come at it from an angle of joy and human connection,” says Rockefeller, “you’re more likely to inspire lasting change than when you come at it from telling people: ‘You have to do without this.’” Clark, 55, and Rockefeller, 52, bonded as “Freecycle renegades”, Rockefeller says. She was trying to give away things (twigs, nettles) that her local Freecycle moderator did not consider suitable gifts; both were looking for a deeper connection beyond an anonymous back-door drop or pickup. “We wanted more of that dialogue,” says Clark. Her attitude was shaped by her experiences as a film-maker, exploring mortuary caves on the Nepal-Tibet border with her husband and children. The objects they found there had been used, exchanged, appreciated and transformed over centuries. “It helped me understand a little more the practical side of reuse and how an entire culture could thrive without any stores.” “The stuff is one thing, but the stories that go along with it – the humour, the poignancy, the memories – those are the things we really want from each other,” agrees Rockefeller. Both, too, were shocked at the tides of plastic detritus that washed up on the beaches of their home on Bainbridge Island. “It led us naturally to ask what role do we play in this and how can we lessen our impact?” The pair started out with an in-person gift exchange in a local park at weekends; they launched the first Facebook-hosted group in 2013. I’m speaking to them surrounded by the debris of a minimal, but not particularly mindful Christmas: cardboard packaging, return labels and scraps of wrapping paper. It’s a time of year characterised for many of us by a sugar rush and guilt slump of conspicuous consumption. Buy Nothing offers members tools and approaches to counter that sickly consumption hangover, but “Buy Nothing” is the name, not the aim. There’s no expectation or even aspiration that users will somehow forge a fully cashless economy. Indeed, during the pandemic, Buy Nothing changed its rules to allow members to give gifts of cash. “Quite literally, that’s a lifesaving gift you can give another person in a lot of cases,” says Rockefeller. “This was never meant to be an exercise in purity: that doesn’t serve us well. What serves us well is flexibility. A banana, a chunk of concrete or $10 – those are all good gifts.” She speaks from personal experience: when the first Buy Nothing group was established, Rockefeller was an unemployed single mother. “I was having to go through the US social services system – it’s horrible and it’s intentionally meant to make you feel horrible about yourself.” Getting food and clothes for her children through Buy Nothing gave her financial breathing space. “I had money to go and buy a cup of coffee or a book, which would have been 100% unreachable for me.” Of equal importance, she says, was being able to gift bread she had made or foods she had foraged, which allowed her to “get some dignity back”. “The services we can provide are gifts in themselves,” adds Clark. “Gifts of time” (babysitting, gardening, lifts) and “gifts of self” (social meet-ups, offers to become a workout buddy) are a key element of the Buy Nothing experience. From that first Facebook group, the community has expanded to 7,000 Buy Nothing groups with, at the most recent count, 5.3 million users in 44 countries as diverse as Guatemala, Iceland, Oman, Vietnam and Zimbabwe. On a slow day, Clark tells me, it gains 1,500 members. The greatest concentrations of communities are in Seattle and New York. There is also a huge, dynamic Australian Buy Nothing network. According to Buy Nothing figures, the UK has 50 active groups and approximately 40,000 members. Although Buy Nothing is described by Clark as “an open-source model”, most local groups operate on Facebook, for which Buy Nothing provides guidance, training and ground rules. A healthy pattern of organic growth, with occasional viral spurts, accelerated during the pandemic. For Clark, physical isolation made people more aware of a deeper kind of isolation. “There’s this ethic of self-reliance, that you fill your house with all the things you need as a family – there you are against the world. But then the pandemic came along. We quickly came to realise how lonely we actually are as a result of not sharing. What we’ve observed is that if people couldn’t physically get together, they’ve been able to virtually connect through sharing items and services.” Inevitably, this kind of growth creates challenges. As groups “sprout” – the Buy Nothing term for when they reach the maximum recommended capacity of 1,000 members and split geographically – redrawn boundaries have at times perpetuated or reinforced historic racial and socio-economic barriers. These issues have on occasion been compounded by the Facebook group structure where considerable power lies in the hands of local administrators, deciding who can join and what they can post. Clark and Rockefeller have addressed Buy Nothing’s failings, including the “flaws and racism we as co-founders built into the original structure of this movement”, as they said in a June 2020 statement. An Equity Team now provides guidance to groups on how to develop an “actively anti-racist and anti-oppression policy”, including trying to use geographical group boundaries to create diverse sharing communities. Miller worked hard to avoid creating a silo of privilege in south-east London when creating the community in 2019. “This area has got huge wealth inequality. It couldn’t be more diverse, and we intentionally wanted to make sure that we straddled those areas; that was a critical goal.” The newly launched Buy Nothing app is designed to swerve the structural potential for inequity of the Facebook group model. Here, users choose their own geographical limits and create their own communities: “hyperlocal”, “neighbourhood+” or “surrounding areas”. “I’m really hoping our app makes this more accessible [to people] who have been unable for a variety of reasons to connect with it on other platforms, so we get a more diverse set of voices,” says Rockefeller. There are personal costs to growth, too. A network of nearly 13,000 volunteer administrators keeps Buy Nothing functioning, assisted by a core staff of a dozen, all working from their kitchen tables and living rooms. Clark and Rockefeller have always been unpaid volunteers. “I work weekends, in the holidays, in the hours when you’re supposed to be sleeping,” says Clark, who was able to make money from film-making initially. “There’s certainly some joy in it, but it’s become unsustainable.” Rockefeller has taken on part-time jobs over the years to support her full-time commitment to Buy Nothing. “My kids look at it as their sibling,” she says. “It’s not just me and Rebecca,” adds Clark. “The key volunteers are an incredible group of, basically, women, who are doing this unpaid labour and it’s not the model we want to promote for the world. We need to get a little more creative with this.” They hope that the app will also allow them to capture data on what Buy Nothing does to reduce waste and waste management costs, thereby potentially enabling it to raise funds from municipalities. “We’ve never been able to study how much waste is being diverted from landfill,” says Clark. “Imagine if any given community could access that information?” Moving from the germ of an idea to a global structure is challenging, but for Clark and Rockefeller, the impetus and the motivation is as strong as ever. I ask about their most memorable experiences with Buy Nothing. Clark describes how musical instruments were collected and delivered to victims of the 2018 fire in Paradise, California. As a community, they had enjoyed making music together. Their basic material needs were met by big charities, but they missed having this creative outlet. For Rockefeller, it’s a source of great pride that her brother-in-law’s community group suggested Buy Nothing as a first port of call when helping refugees from Afghanistan settle in their town. “We’re building this tool that I really believe will have the power to help us, as individuals, to participate in our collective survival,” she says. Over in south-east London, members of the Blackheath/Charlton/Lewisham group appreciate the new friendships and the sense of local connection. “It’s culturally so different from any kind of other free stuff group out there,” says Miller. “I love giving back to the community and turning to it when I’m in need of something” adds Elif Koç. “I can spend what I’ve saved for charity and other meaningful causes.” Their group has shared camping equipment and loaned books to children; it has supported a victim of domestic violence and a refugee in setting up home and providing clothing for their families. It does feel like a gentle revolution – one houseplant cutting or power tool at a time. As one member, Sarah Wilde, puts it: “I really like the opportunity to quietly rage against the machine.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,"‘A banana, concrete – those are good gifts’: the recycling group turning strangers into friends",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/13/a-banana-concrete-those-are-good-gifts-recycling-group-turning-strangers-into-friends
1/13/2022,"Internet grooming of children has surged during lockdown, according to new research that found a threefold increase in online sexual abuse imagery featuring seven to 10-year-olds. The Internet Watch Foundation reported its worst year on record for child sex abuse online in 2021 as it confirmed 252,000 URLs containing images or videos of children being sexually abused, compared with 153,000 in the previous year. The UK-based charity said it had seen a large increase in self-generated material – where children are manipulated into recording their own abuse before it is shared online – with the fastest growing increase in such material occurring among seven to 10-year-olds.  The IWF said the rise in cases could be linked to Covid lockdowns which required people to stay indoors and led to millions spending more time online. It said lockdowns led to younger and younger children being targeted on an “industrial scale” by internet groomers. “Child safety experts say younger children have been relying more and more on the internet during the pandemic, and that spending longer online may be leaving them more vulnerable to communities of criminals who are looking to find and manipulate children into recording their own sexual abuse on camera. The footage is then shared among other criminals on the open internet,” said the IWF report. In 2021, the IWF reported 182,000 instances of self-generated material. Of these confirmed cases 27,000 were seven to 10-year-olds, which is more than treble the number for 2020. Once the IWF confirms that reports of abuse – largely from members of the public, the police, tech firms or IWF analysts themselves – are genuine, they are reported to authorities in countries where the servers hosting the content are based. The IWF said the biggest age group for self-generated sex abuse material remained 11- to 13-year-olds, with 148,000 reports made to the organisation last year. “Children are being targeted, approached, groomed and abused by criminals on an industrial scale,” said Susie Hargreaves, IWF chief executive. “So often, this sexual abuse is happening in children’s bedrooms in family homes, with parents being wholly unaware of what is being done to their children by strangers with an internet connection.” On Thursday the House of Commons will debate a report by a joint committee of MPs and peers into the draft online safety bill, which imposes a duty of care on tech firms to protect children from harmful content, as well as preventing the proliferation of illegal content and activity such as child pornography. Responding to the IWF figures, the head of child safety online policy at the NSPCC, Andy Burrows, said it was “crucial” that the bill is strengthened to prevent online grooming of children. The figures were released as the UK government launched a new online safety campaign, Stop Abuse Together, to help parents and carers spot signs of abuse. The safeguarding minister, Rachel Maclean, said: “Keeping children safe is one of this government’s highest priorities and we are committed to doing all we can to combat the increased identification of child sexual abuse online.”",News/Society,"2021 was worst year on record for online child sex abuse, says IWF",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/13/2021-was-worst-year-on-record-for-online-child-sex-abuse-says-iwf
1/13/2022,"The Home Office has told asylum seekers from some of the world’s biggest conflict zones that it is safe for them to return there, the Guardian has learned. A 36-year-old from Yemen and a 21-year-old from Afghanistan have both had their asylum claims rejected by government officials on the basis that they would not be at risk in their home countries.  The disclosure follows the case of a 25-year-old Syrian asylum seeker who was told it would be safe for him to go back to Syria. The Home Office’s own guidance as well as that from UNHCR warns of the dangers of returning refugees to countries such as Syria, Afghanistan and Yemen. The Syrian man, who sought sanctuary in the UK in May 2020, was told by a Home Office official who rejected his asylum claim that it would be safe for him to return. He fled forced conscription into Bashar al-Assad’s army in 2017, saying that he would have been forced to kill other Syrians. He said that if he is forced back to Syria he will be targeted as a draft evader, arrested, detained and killed. While the Home Office has accepted he did flee forced conscription, the refusal letter states: “It is not accepted that you will face a risk of persecution or real risk of serious harm on return to the Syrian Arab Republic due to your imputed political opinion as a draft evader.” However, the day after the Guardian approached the Home Office for comment about the case, the man’s lawyers received a letter retracting the decision. “It has been concluded that the decision to refuse your client’s protection claim is not in accordance with the Home Office’s published country policy position and is therefore withdrawn with a view to granting asylum,” it said. The Guardian has further learned of an asylum seeker from Yemen who was told by the Home Office in a refusal of his asylum claim in June 2021 that he could return to his country because officials “do not accept that there are problems in Yemen”. The asylum seeker, 36, an accountant who is married and has two children, has various physical and mental health problems, but the refusal letter states that there is “a substantial public health programme in Yemen”. The health infrastructure in Yemen is severely battered and non-existent in some parts of the country. “I was so depressed and disappointed with the decision. All aspects of Yemen are a disaster,” the asylum seeker said. His lawyers have appealed against the decision but there are significant backlogs and the man has yet to be given a date for his appeal. In a third case a 21-year-old Afghan man who arrived in the UK as a 16-year-old boy after fleeing forced conscription by the Taliban at his madrassa has been informed by Home Office officials that they want to revoke the refugee status he was previously given and return him to Afghanistan because he has a cannabis-related conviction. The Home Office letter, dated 15 December 2021, states that the Taliban are now the de facto authorities in Afghanistan. It adds: “It is not considered that they [the Taliban] would still have an adverse interest in a low level person such as you.” UNHCR said that, while it cannot comment on individual cases, it calls on states to suspend forcible returns of asylum seekers “to countries that remain volatile, lack sufficient security or are unable to offer adequate human rights protection”. A spokesperson added: “Afghanistan, Yemen and Syria are among the countries which UNHCR recommends forcible returns should be avoided. While conflict has subsided in Afghanistan, a humanitarian emergency is ongoing, making forced return inappropriate. In both Yemen and Syria, the dire humanitarian context is compounded by conflict and insecurity.” Anita Vashisht, head of immigration at Wilsons solicitors, the firm representing the Syrian asylum seeker, said: “The hard and harsh fact is the Home Office did refuse the claim and that decision did cause distress to the client. The refusal decision forced us to lodge an appeal on the client’s behalf which meant the tribunal had to wastefully direct its resources to handling this appeal matter. This is yet another shocking example of terrible and unlawful decision-making on the part of the Home Office.” Jamie Bell of Duncan Lewis solicitors, who is representing the Afghan refugee, said: “In the context of the ever deteriorating security and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan, it is deeply concerning that the Home Office have seemingly indicated without foundation and in breach of their own policies that Afghanistan may be safe for those who have been previous victims of the Taliban.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “We do not routinely comment on individual cases. All asylum claims, including those from nationals of Yemen, Syria and Afghanistan, are considered on a case by case basis, based on the facts presented by the claimant. “That is the case regardless of the claimant’s country of origin and the prevailing situation there. We will not return anyone to countries where they have been found to be at risk of persecution or serious harm.”",News/UK news,Home Office tells Afghan and Yemeni asylum seekers they can return safely,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/13/home-office-tells-afghan-and-yemeni-asylum-seekers-they-can-return-safely
1/13/2022,"Water companies in England should each designate a stretch of river as bathing water by 2025 to drive the cleanup of a chemical cocktail of sewage, agricultural waste and plastic pollution that is suffocating biodiversity and risking public health, MPs have said. In a report published on Thursday, MPs on the environmental audit committee said they wanted more assertive regulation and enforcement from Ofwat and the Environment Agency to restore rivers to good ecological health, protect biodiversity and adapt to a changing climate. They also called for Ofwat to act to limit bonuses paid to water company bosses who continue to oversee the dumping of raw sewage into England’s rivers.  The MPs condemned Liv Garfield, the chief executive of Severn Trent Water, as “disingenuous” for suggesting in evidence that discharges of raw sewage from storm overflows into rivers were “pretty much already rainwater”. “As water companies do not routinely test the quality of the discharges from storm overflows, they are in no position to make this claim. Discharges from overflows can be highly contaminated with raw sewage and other pollutants,” the report found. The cocktail of pollutants choking English rivers comes from three main sources: • Agricultural pollution: the use of fertilisers and pesticides and the intensive farming of livestock and poultry can all contribute to poor water quality, as rainfall runoff from farm land carries chemicals and faecal matter into streams and rivers • Sewage and wastewater: discharges from combined sewer overflows, which should only be used after exceptional rainfall, are now routine. They combine with urban runoff as a huge chemical cocktail: faecal microbes, hydrocarbons, industrial chemicals, plastics, pharmaceuticals and personal care products • Runoff from towns, cities and transport, referred to as urban diffuse pollution. In built up areas, pollutants accumulate on hard surfaces such as roads and car parks which can then be washed into the sewer network during rainfall. It enters surface water drainage systems the pollutants are then discharged directly into rivers, streams or estuaries untreated where they can cause acute or chronic problems “To claim otherwise shows a disregard for the public’s concern about water quality in rivers.” “Rivers in England are in a mess,” the MPs said. “A chemical cocktail of sewage, agricultural waste, and plastic is polluting the waters of many of the country’s rivers. “Water companies appear to be dumping untreated or partially treated sewage in rivers on a regular basis, often breaching the terms of permits that on paper only allow them to do this in exceptional circumstances.” The impact on the ecological health of rivers has been dire; only 14% of English rivers meet good ecological standards and no river is deemed to be of good chemical status. In 39 of 42 main salmon rivers in England, the populations are categorised as being at risk or probably at risk, the report said. MPs said the government should actively encourage the designation of at least one widely used stretch of river for bathing within each water company area by 2025 at the latest – something that places a legal obligation on water companies to improve water quality and has triggered huge improvements in coastal water quality. Only one river in the UK – the River Wharfe in Ilkley – currently has an area designated as bathing water. The report said sewage discharges were only one part of the pollution spilling into rivers. Agricultural runoff containing fertiliser and farm slurry was a major pollutant, as was runoff from towns, cities and transport. Poor water quality in the River Wye has been linked to agricultural pollution from poultry farming, which has increased unchecked since 2000, with an estimated 20m farmed birds currently on premises in the Wye catchment. The MPs condemned outdated, underfunded and inadequate monitoring of river water quality, with budget cuts to the Environment Agency hampering the ability to monitor water quality in rivers and detect permit breaches or pollution incidents from the water industry and farming. The Guardian revealed this week that the agency had instructed staff to “shut down” and ignore reports of low-impact pollution events because it did not have enough money to investigate them. They called for an urgent review of the way in which water companies are allowed to self-report pollution, as MPs said they were alarmed at the extent of sewage discharge, large spills by water companies, and misreporting. Citizen monitoring of water companies’ data showed that the true number of sewer overflow discharges may be much higher than those reported to the Environment Agency. The MPs’ report said water companies must be more transparent at releasing easily accessible information on sewage discharges as close to the time they happen as possible. Many of the pollutants discharged into rivers were simply not monitored, MPs said. Plastic pollution was now “ubiquitous” in English rivers and freshwaters, with single use and “unflushable” plastic products left to pollute riverbanks and create wet-wipe “reefs”. In some sections of the River Irwell in the north-west, there were 500,000 fragments of plastic for every 1 sq metre of riverbed – “many, many more times [that of] the number of insects”, the report said. However, there was no monitoring by regulators of plastics, or other substances including metals, pesticides, pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals. Philip Dunne, the Conservative chair of the environmental audit committee, said: “Rivers are the arteries of nature and must be protected. Our inquiry has uncovered multiple failures in the monitoring, governance and enforcement on water quality. For too long, the government, regulators and the water industry have allowed a Victorian sewerage system to buckle under increasing pressure. “Today, we are calling for these relevant bodies to come together and develop a system fit for the future.” A spokesperson for Severn Trent said: “Storm overflows are designed to redirect flow, which is predominantly rainwater, from highway drains, roofs or driveways, to nearby watercourses to protect communities and homes from flooding. Based on the formula in current common usage by the Environment Agency and the flow assessments we carry out on our network, we believe an average of around 90% of the discharge from Severn Trent overflows is rainwater.”",News/Environment,MPs call for bathing rivers across England as part of anti-pollution drive,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/13/bathing-rivers-england-pollution-water-quality-mps-report
1/13/2022,"When Dominic Cummings left Downing Street in November 2020, it was meant to be an amicable departure from Boris Johnson. But it soured within days, amid a briefing war. The prime minister’s former chief aide and his allies were described as presiding over a “macho culture” at No 10. Cummings is said to have reacted to the negative stories by warning Johnson: “I have never briefed against you: believe me, when I do, you’ll fucking know about it.”  In that sense, Cummings has certainly been true to his word. Key advisers, bound usually by a residual loyalty, normally remain relatively quiet after they depart a prime minister’s side. But Cummings has always been different, and armed with his knowledge of a year and a half at the very top of government, he has been willing to fight back ever since. It was Cummings who prompted Johnson’s most serious crisis yet. Last week he revealed in a blog that, on 20 May 2020, “a senior No 10 official invited people to ‘socially distanced drinks’ in the garden”. That posting was, in part a response, to the Guardian publishing a picture of Johnson, Cummings and others chatting over cheese and wine in Downing Street on 15 May 2020. The photo in the Guardian had appeared a week before Christmas, following weeks of revelations across the media about lockdown-breaching parties at Downing Street. Cummings insisted this gathering was a work meeting and that somebody, possibly the prime minister himself, “brought a bottle of wine out to the table”. This rebuttal was published on 7 January, just as the political year had begun to restart. Three days later came another revelation. On Monday, ITV published the now infamous invitation from Johnson’s principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, who emailed more than 100 staff inviting them to drinks in the Downing Street garden on 20 May 2020. Within about half an hour of ITV’s report Cummings tweeted to say Johnson himself was present, using the shopping trolley emoji he uses to describe his former boss.In evidence to MPs last May, he accused Johnson of being so indecisive he ends up “smashing from one side of the aisle to the other”. With other sources confirming Johnson’s presence at the gathering 18 months ago, the prime minister had little choice but to apologise in the Commons on Wednesday, although he insisted the event “could be said, technically, to fall within the guidance” of the time as it had taken place at work, even if it was the Downing Street garden. Not so said Cummings, tweeting his reply a few minutes after Johnson delivered his statement. In a potent mixture of upper and lower case, Cummings wrote: “The invite = obv totally SOCIAL NOT WORK. (UNlike all the mtngs in garden). No way ‘technically within rules’.” It was he added “bullshit cos altern[ative] is admit he broke rules + resign”. The timing of the 20 May party may also explain why Cummings was not immediately fired by Johnson when two days later it emerged that his then chief aide had travelled to Durham in March that year, despite having symptoms of coronavirus. Instead the prime minister forced him to explain himself in person – in the Downing Street garden. Few believe that the public briefing will stop here. “Cummings is the kind of person who, once he focuses on something keeps going and going until he feels he has won,” said one former political associate who worked with him on the Vote Leave campaign in 2016. “It’s what makes him difficult and what makes him brilliant.”",News/Politics,No end in sight for Dominic Cummings’ briefing war against Johnson,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/13/no-end-in-sight-for-dominic-cummings-briefing-war-against-johnson
1/13/2022,"An inquiry into Downing Street parties that could determine the fate of Boris Johnson’s premiership should be given greater independence from No 10, former civil servants and a union leader have warned. It comes amid concerns that the prime minister could veto the conclusions of an inquiry by Sue Gray if she recommends that he should be investigated under the ministerial code.  Gray, a senior civil servant, was appointed last month to examine claims that Downing Street officials broke Covid rules by holding a series of parties and events during the pandemic. She replaced her line manager – the cabinet secretary, Simon Case – after it emerged that a Christmas quiz was alleged to have been held in his office. However, her inquiry has grown in gravity and potential impact amid calls for Johnson to step down following a public outcry over further party revelations. On Wednesday, Johnson gave a partial apology for attending a “bring your own booze” party in No 10’s garden on 20 May 2020. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, accused Johnson of breaking the ministerial code by making misleading statements in a series of denials about parties at No 10. “That code says ministers who knowingly mislead parliament will be expected to offer their resignation,” Starmer told MPs. Afterwards, several Tory MPs privately said they would await the Gray findings and, if damning, call for their prime minister to quit. Gray, whose inquiry could conclude as early as next week, can recommend that Johnson has broken the ministerial code. The terms of reference for her inquiry state that “the conduct of ministers should follow the process set out in the ministerial code in the normal way”. However, Dave Penman, the head of the FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, said if Gray makes a recommendation for further inquiries under the ministerial code, Johnson still has the power to block it. “The prime minister himself gets to decide if he needs to be investigated under the ministerial code. No one else can make that decision and he has so far refused to give up this veto despite the recommendations from the committee for standards in public life to do so,” he said. Gray is running the inquiry from the Cabinet Office along with staff members from the propriety and ethics team. She previously headed the same team for six years, during which she ended the careers of three cabinet ministers and vetted the memoirs of ministers. Senior civil servants have expressed concern that the inquiry’s conclusions will be scrutinised by both Johnson and Case. Bob Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, said he had previously been happy for the inquiry to be run by Case but believed the latest revelations meant a retired judge should be asked to receive Gray’s findings. “Sue Gray is an immensely capable investigator but one has to recognise that two of the principal actors here – the PM and the cabinet secretary, effectively her bosses – are now deeply implicated in the inquiry. That is completely unprecedented. The findings could decide whether they stay in their jobs or not. “The latest revelations over the events of 20 May 2020 have raised real questions as to whether there should be another independent person involved – a retired judge, for example – who could then receive this report, rather than it being passed directly on to the prime minister and the cabinet secretary,” he said. Sir David Normington, who worked at the Home Office and oversaw public appointments, said Gray had been placed in a “very odd” position as the public waited for her verdict. “She’s in the middle of a political maelstrom at the moment, trying to establish the facts, and there’ll be a lot of pressure on her to conclude this investigation as quickly as possible,” he said. “She will be very aware that she has the reputations and possibly the careers of senior civil servants and possibly of the prime minister in her hands. That is a very difficult position to be in, however fair and fearless and rigorous you are.” A Cabinet Office spokesperson said they would not speculate on the inquiry.",News/Politics,"No 10 parties inquiry should have more independence, say former civil servants",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/13/no-10-parties-inquiry-boris-johnson-sue-gray-former-civil-servants
1/13/2022,"A surge in Covid infections on cruise ships is causing mayhem across the industry, leaving passengers stranded aboard ships, exacerbating staff shortages and prompting the CDC to warn US passengers against all cruise travel.  The CDC director said this week that Covid cases have increased 30-fold in just two weeks. Every one of the nearly 100 cruise ships currently carrying passengers in US waters has reported enough Covid-19 cases to merit investigation by the CDC, according to the agency’s website. Over the holidays, passengers found themselves floating around on ships that couldn’t dock because foreign ports were turning them away or facing long, onboard quarantines before being allowed to come home, after testing positive for Covid. Dozens of cruises have been cancelled and some ports in the Caribbean and South America are turning ships away from making daily visits. “It wasn’t the cruise we signed up for,” said Janet Silver Ghent, a Palo Alto retiree and editor who was stuck onboard a South America cruise for eight days, when ports in Chile and Argentina refused to let passengers disembark because of Covid cases. On December 30, the CDC issued its highest travel warning, advising the public to avoid cruise ship travel even if vaccinated. The agency said, at the time, that the number of infections reported on cruise ships had jumped to 5,013 between 15-29 December – up from only 162 in the first two weeks of December. CDC director Dr Rochelle Walensky, speaking at a senate health hearing on Tuesday, said that the numbers have continued to skyrocket, though the agency did not respond to requests for updated case counts. “Just over the last two weeks with Omicron, we’ve seen a 30 fold increase in cases on ships,” Walensky said. The problems come just six months after the cruise industry’s big comeback, when companies resumed full operations after having voyages shut down for more than a year by the pandemic. Fortunately, unlike the outbreaks that rattled the global cruise industry early in the pandemic, there have been no initial reports of serious illness or death in the latest surge. Most cruise companies are requiring passengers to be fully vaccinated and tested before setting sail, likely helping to limit the severity of outbreaks. “Our case count has spiked, but the level of severity is significantly milder,” said Royal Caribbean Group’s chief medical officer Dr Calvin Johnson, in a statement last month. The company reported that, since cruising restarted in the US in June 2021, only 1,745 of its 1.1 million guests have tested positive – a positivity rate of 0.162%. Of those, it said, only 41 people needed hospitalization. But the case surge is nonetheless causing headaches for cruise operators and passengers. Florida maritime attorney James Walker said that thousands of cruise ship crew members have tested positive and that many are quarantining on a handful of out-of-service ships. “Given the number of crew members who are ill, there are significant staffing problems,” said Walker, who believes cruise lines should suspend their operations until after the Omicron surge. “For the people who pay to go on a cruise, the service isn’t there.” By the time the CDC issued its warning against cruise ship travel on 30 December, many holiday passengers were already aboard and seeing their dream cruises disrupted by Omicron. Some have opted to try and make the best of it. Five days after Utah resident Brett Williams and his wife set sail on what was supposed be an 11-day Caribbean cruise, he said 48 crew members and 51 passengers of the small 342-passenger sailing ship, the MSY Wind Surf, tested positive and had to be taken off the ship for quarantine in Barbados. Within a few days, he and his wife and many other passengers also tested positive and were told they couldn’t fly home until they each received a negative test result. Despite experiencing no symptoms, Brett Williams’ tests remained stubbornly positive. The psychologist and author made the best of what turned out to be 12 extra days stuck on the ship, eating complimentary deluxe room service meals, taking pictures of beautiful sunsets and working on his new book, a self help guide, ironically titled Unstuck. At one point, when all the other passengers had been sent home, he and his wife even got to enjoy the ship’s spa pool by themselves, where he joked he wanted to order up “a quarantini”. “Life has risks,” said Williams, who described the trip as “awesome” despite the disruptions. “We were willing to embrace the risks.” Ghent and her husband, Allen Podell, also managed to enjoy their South America trip even though their ship, the Viking Jupiter, spent so much time at sea, since they couldn’t dock, that the entertainers aboard used up all their routines in the first few days and had to resort to improvising entirely new material. Ghent said Viking’s testing routines were extremely strict, requiring all passengers to take a spit PCR test every day. “I spit so much, I never want to spit again,” she said. Passengers who were deemed to be exposed were taken off the ship for quarantine. These included actor Liev Schreiber, who proceeded to post viral videos from his quarantine hotel in Chile, tapping out beats on a Casio synthesiser and calling himself DJ Covid. Ghent’s husband, Podell,83, ate voluminous amounts of sushi and spent his time singing along with the guitarist in the Viking ship’s Explorer Lounge. While the boat was never able to dock in its final destination port, Buenos Aires, Argentina, Podell enjoyed belting out renditions of John Denver’s Take Me Home Country Roads and made up his own version of an Evita song: Don’t Make Me Cry, Argentina. Ghent and Podell eventually got off the ship in Uruguay, where they were supposed to spend one day but ended up spending five. The cruise line chartered a plane to get passengers back to Miami. From there, the couple missed their connecting flight to San Francisco and temporarily lost their baggage, but managed to keep their sense of humor all the same. “Nobody’s going to feel sorry for us for cruising the Atlantic,” said Podell. Officials in the cruise industry, which has lost a lot of money since the start of the pandemic, were also trying to take the setbacks in stride.“Omicron is having a big short-term impact on everyone,” said Richard Fain, CEO of Royal Caribbean in a statement, but argued that cruises are one of the safer places for people to vacation because everyone aboard is vaccinated. “Many observers see this as a major step towards Covid-19 becoming endemic rather than an epidemic.”",News/World news,‘Not the cruise I signed up for’: 30-fold increase in Covid cases upends industry,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/12/cruise-covid-cases-ship-industry
1/13/2022,"When a Manhattan judge rejected Prince Andrew’s efforts to dismiss Virginia Giuffre’s sexual abuse lawsuit against him on Wednesday, it marked a victory for his longtime accuser. Judge Lewis Kaplan’s ruling also means that the embattled royal will remain embroiled in lengthy – and embarrassing – legal proceedings for the foreseeable future.  “This is a huge development because it clears probably the biggest legal hurdle Virginia Giuffre and her team had to get her case to a jury,” said Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor and co-founder of West Coast Trial Lawyers. Giuffre, now 38, has long alleged that she was coerced into sex with the Duke of York at the age of 17 by two of his associates – the disgraced American financier Jeffrey Epstein and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell. Andrew’s lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Kaplan’s decision. Epstein, a convicted sex offender, killed himself in a New York jail in summer 2019 pending trial on sex-trafficking charges. Maxwell was found guilty on 29 December of sex-trafficking and related charges for bringing teen girls to Epstein. Giuffre first alleged in legal papers filed in 2015 that she was forced to have sex with the prince in Epstein’s New York mansion, on his private island in the US Virgin Islands, and at Maxwell’s London home. Giuffre filed the civil suit against the prince in Manhattan federal court in August of last year, also accusing him of battery and intentionally inflicting emotional distress. Andrew denies the allegations. His legal team asked Kaplan to throw out Giuffre’s suit on several grounds. His lawyers contended that a 2009 settlement between Giuffre and Epstein shielded him from her lawsuit. They pointed to a clause that released “second parties and any other person or entity who could have been included as a potential defendant … from all, and all manner of, action and actions of Virginia [Giuffre], including state or federal, cause and causes of action.” Andrew was not named in this settlement. Andrew also argued that Giuffre’s claims were too vague, meaning that he wouldn’t be able to adequately defend himself against the allegations. Kaplan rejected the vagary-based claim and said it would be premature for him to decide on what, exactly, the 2009 settlement meant for Andrew. “Judge Kaplan said it’s a question of fact, and questions of fact go to the jury,” Rahmani said. “If it were clear that the settlement agreement covered the prince, he could have dismissed the case, but he chose not to. He said the intent of the settlement agreement is something that juries would have to decide.” Rahmani pointed out that “the vast majority of civil lawsuits settle for a number of reasons”. Victims might not want to testify in public about sexual abuse. Defendants, meanwhile, don’t want to face judgement should juries find in favor of accusers – nor the continued onslaught of bad press that can increase with a public trial. However, Rahmani believes this is the rare civil case that is more likely to go before a jury than settle. Giuffre previously settled “for what I would say is an insignificant amount – a nominal amount, pennies on the dollar” for a sexual abuse claim against mega-millionaire Epstein. And, unlike many others, Giuffre has openly discussed her trauma. She did not testify at Maxwell’s trial, so “this is her one chance to tell her story in a very public way”, Rahmani said. The prince might also be opposed to settlement for his own reasons. “Prince Andrew has denied that this ever happened, so if he enters into any settlement – even if there’s no admission of liability, even if he tries to keep it confidential, even if it’s not for legal reasons – for PR, reasons, I think this case is going to move forward,” Rahmani said. “There’s just a number of factors that make this a very unique civil case, which is why, I think, much, much, much more likely to go to trial than your other civil cases.” Andrew can fight Kaplan’s ruling, either by asking the judge to reconsider, or asking an appeals court to review the decision, though the odds are not in his favor. “An appeal will be very difficult,” said longtime defense attorney Julie Rendelman. “It was made very clear that the issues that were raised by Prince Andrew’s attorneys are something that are a question of fact, not a question of law and therefore, something that a jury needs to decide, not the judge.” “When you look at the decision that the judge wrote, it covers all the bases in terms of all the issues raised, and I think that particularly when it comes to a question of fact for a jury, an appeals court is hard pressed to step on that decision-making process.” While some deadlines are scheduled in the case – including, for example, a 28 July cutoff for both sides to submit a pre-trial proposal – they should be taken with a grain of salt. Depositions and production of evidence could spur still more depositions and production of evidence, spurring extensions of deadlines. Andrew contends that on the night Giuffre claims she was forced into sex with him in London, he had brought his daughter, Beatrice, to a late-afternoon children’s party at a Pizza Express in Woking, Surrey. The prince insists that he was then at home with his children all night. Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

Total revenues fell by £33m to £200m in the year ending 30 April 2021, accounts for Foster + Partners, the practice’s main trading company, show. But profits before tax almost doubled to £36.2m during the year, compared with £19.8m in the previous year.  At the start of the pandemic Foster + Partners braced for a severe financial hit. The company furloughed about 70 staff at the start of lockdown in March 2020 because they were unable to work from home. However, the accounts show the firm had “remarkable financial resilience” and said it had gained new projects throughout various global lockdowns. The company later said it had repaid in full about £500,000 in furlough money once it was clear there was no financial peril. The practice, one of the largest in the world with 1,200 employees, completed 13 projects during the financial year, including a brain research institute in Jerusalem, a library in the Sharjah emirate, and a new headquarters for golf’s PGA Tour in Florida. In the latest financial year the firm has had plans rejected for the Tulip, a controversial tower planned in central London, and a Manhattan penthouse apartment for the billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman. The Middle East is the practice’s biggest region, where it has four branches. The accounts highlighted three joint ventures in the region working on the Sheikh Zayed National Museum in Abu Dhabi, Kuwait international airport, and a new city in Kuwait for 280,000 people named after the country’s emir, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad. The Kuwaiti city is one of several it is working on across the Middle East and China. Foster + Partners made a £8.8m payment to 180 of its senior employee “partners” on top of their salaries. However, total pay for the 10 directors fell from £20.3m to £12.3m. Pay for the highest-paid director, thought to be Lord Foster, fell from £2.3m to £1.4m. The bumper profits were higher than in 2019, before the pandemic struck. The company highlighted falling costs because of limits on business travel and “the enforced remote working regime”, which affected everyone except some model makers and printers. However, the firm indicated that it was keen to return to normal business travel, citing an “unquantifiable extent” of lost new business as well as educating younger colleagues in international architecture. “The practice will undeniably benefit from the resumption of travel,” it said.

1/13/2022,"The passage of a cold front is a common occurrence in the UK, often bringing a spell of wind and rain, with colder air following behind. Along the frontal boundary, warm air residing ahead of the front is forced to rise above the colder, denser incoming air. This is a form of convection, a process generating lively rainfall at the surface. Along stronger cold fronts, where temperature differences either side are larger, convection is stronger, generating heavier rainfall. This rain can organise into narrow bands stretching along the frontal boundary, appearing on weather radar as lines of intense rainfall – this is “line convection”. These features can bring a brief spell of torrential rainfall and squally winds that are often no more than 3 miles (5km) wide.  Line convection is often broken up into strong line segments, which are discrete lines of intense precipitation and strong winds separated by calmer gaps. As a line segment passes overhead, temperatures can quickly drop, pressure can jump up and the wind can veer abruptly. In rare cases, tornadoes can form from complex wind patterns between line segments. One such case occurred in the village of Humberston in north-east Lincolnshire on 27 September 2021, causing damage to homes and vehicles.",News/News,Line convection can bring intense showers and heavy winds,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/jan/13/line-convection-can-bring-intense-showers-and-heavy-winds
1/13/2022,"“For words are the birds of everything,” writes Ted Hughes (in Prometheus on His Crag), “So soon / Everything is on the wing and gone.” A derelict nest box rests on the trunk of a lime tree above the old railway line. The birds are gone; the leaves are gone; the spring and summer are gone; the rain, the snow, the sunshine are gone. It is the January of a new year, damp, cold and muddy. In this season of passing, some are already searching for signs of spring and wishing winter gone when it’s only just arrived. The seasons of spring and autumn used to be transformative. They marked the dawn and sunset of life in the temperate world. Now winter is fleeting; often a non-season. This one began as the warmest ever. Too warm, too wet, too cold, too much – moaning about the weather is a cultural obligation, but winter will soon be gone. We are a people wishing ourselves over the edge.  There are words that have not yet flown but are so easily scattered: brambling, jackdaw, redwing, greenfinch, yew aril, hart’s-tongue, polypody, spurge laurel, catkin, vole. These are an everything seen within a few minutes under trees around the old railway track – which has gone. Like the ruins of a forest temple in a tangle of roots, the little nest box looks the same as the ivy branches that grip it to the tree bark. These are no longer separate things, all have weathered to become the same material, the same colour with the same beetle holes. How many generations fledged from here? What kinds of birds? Where did they go? There are marks around the entrance hole where birds have pecked to enlarge it, and much of the structure is missing. There is not much left but an impression of a nest box on a lime tree: a once-was, not a will-be. It is no longer a “nest box” so its word and bird have flown, leaving a kind of winter, some unremembered, barely noticeable thing that marks a somewhere else now, an afterlife.
