3/27/2022,"A UK cabinet minister has distanced the government from Joe Biden’s call that Russia’s Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power” amid criticism that the comment could bolster the Kremlin. Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary, said it was “for the Russian people to decide how they are governed” after the unscripted remark from Biden at a speech in Poland, which the White House later said was not a call for regime change. “I think that’s up to the Russian people,” he told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday. “The Russian people, I think, are pretty fed up with what is happening in Ukraine, this illegal invasion, the destruction of their own livelihoods, their economy is collapsing around them and I think the Russian people will decide the fate of Putin and his cronies.” The comments came from Biden at a speech in Poland, as Russia fired missiles aimed at the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, just 40 miles from the Polish border. The city is the most pro-western in the country and the base of many western journalists. Analysts described the attacks as intending to send a clear signal to the White House. Biden described Putin as a “butcher” and told an audience in Warsaw that the west must steel itself “for a long fight ahead”. But in what seemed to be a dramatic shift in US policy, Biden also appeared to urge those around the Russian president to oust him from the Kremlin. “For god’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,” Biden said. US officials later said that Biden had been talking about the need for Putin to lose power over Ukrainian territory and in the wider region. Zahawi stopped short of saying Biden had been wrong to make the call. “It’s an illegal invasion of Ukraine and that must end, and I think that’s what the president was talking about. “The White House has been very clear on this, the president gave a very powerful speech on this and I think both the United States and the United Kingdom agree that it’s up to the Russian people to decide who should be governing them.” Some have voiced fears that the speech would bolster Putin domestically. Tobias Ellwood, chair of the defence select committee, said it had been “unwise” to make the remark, saying Putin would “spin this, dig in and fight harder”. But the former Labour foreign secretary Margaret Beckett said she could understood what prompted the call. “I rather like what we’ve seen in Joe Biden. I know that he gets a lot of criticism but he strikes me as being somebody who has strong feelings and is inclined to then just voice them,” she told Sky. “And, you know, maybe we don’t get quite enough of that sincerity and reaction, sometimes, from people in our political world. I’m sure that his staff and the people around him are right to say America’s not calling for regime change, but equally I think many people will sympathise with the sentiments that led him to say what he did.” On Sunday, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, also told the Sunday Telegraph that sanctions on Russian banks, businesses and individuals could be lifted if Putin withdrew from Ukraine. The comments were similar to that of her US counterpart Antony Blinken, who said that the crushing economic sanctions were “not designed to be permanent”. Truss said there were strict conditions for the measures to be eased: “Those sanctions should only come off with a full ceasefire and withdrawal, but also commitments that there will be no further aggression. “And also, there’s the opportunity to have snapback sanctions if there is further aggression in future. That is a real lever that I think can be used.”",News/Politics,UK minister distances the government from Joe Biden’s call for regime change in Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/27/nadhim-zahawi-biden-russia-putin
3/27/2022,"There is a neat irony here: had Tess Seddon been half as charming on the campaign trail as this show about her failed attempt to stand for parliament, she would probably be an MP. But then we wouldn’t have this delightful gem, so while her political ambitions remain unfulfilled, we should be thankful she garnered only 303 votes when she stood for the Yorkshire party by accident in the 2017 general election. Her failed campaign has been turned into a winning musical that absolutely insists itself upon you, not least because it stars the personable Seddon as herself. “There will never be a year worse than 2016,” she says at the top of the show, taking us back to what Pinter recalled when writing about Len Hutton in his prime; another time. Seddon delivers the line with the first of at least 100 eyebrows-raised, if-only-we’d-known looks that she shares in her role. We were so innocent then, the eyebrows say, particularly Seddon who moved back to Yorkshire after a family breakup and the acceptance that she wasn’t going to make it as a playwright in London. She also leaves behind a Tinder hook-up called Sacha whose personality is summed up by the crucifix earring he wears. Back home she starts to research a fringe group called the Yorkshire party, thinking it ripe for material, but finds herself outed as an infiltrator at a party gathering. Buffeted by the winds of fate, she is selected to represent the group when they realise she is the most electable person in the room. A cast of four, including Seddon, plus Jamie Noar on keyboards, power their way through a musical pastiche of a show that falters only when it takes itself too seriously. The Yorkshire party, the cast sing, want to put the skip into Skipton, the rad into Bradford and the penis into Penistone. Seddon is not a comfortable performer on stage and her singing is truly appalling, but when she embraces this and ditches the sincerity, the work is joyful. It’s not Les Mis, but while unsophisticated, it does have a heart the size of at least one of the Ridings.

3/27/2022,"Sean Penn has described any potential lack of backing by the Academy Awards for the Ukrainian people as “the most obscene moment in all of Hollywood history”. Speaking on CNN, Penn, who has been in Ukraine and Poland making a documentary about their plight of refugees, vowed to publicly melt down his Oscar statuettes if the awards body declined to offer the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a platform at Sunday night’s event. “There is nothing greater that the Academy Awards could do than to give [Zelenskiy] an opportunity to talk to all of us,” said Penn. “It is my understanding that a decision has been made not to do it. That is not me commenting on whether or not President Zelenskiy had wanted to.” Penn suggested that if the Academy had “elected not to pursue the leadership in Ukraine, who are taking bullets and bombs for us, along with the Ukrainian children that they are trying to protect, then I think every single one of those people and every bit of that decision will have been the most obscene moment in all of Hollywood history”. Earlier this week, Amy Schumer, one of the three hosts for this year’s ceremony, said she had pitched “a way to have Zelenskiy satellite in or make a tape” but implied her input had been unwelcome. “I am not afraid to go there,” she said. “But it’s not me producing the Oscars.” Other sources reported that Zelenskiy had declined an invitation to contribute via Zoom. Penn urged a widespread boycott of the event should it be confirmed that an approach to Zelenskiy had not been made. “If it comes back to it, I will smelt mine in public,” Penn said. “I pray that’s not what’s happened. I pray there have not been arrogant people, who consider themselves representatives of the greater good in my industry, that have [decided against checking] with leadership in Ukraine. So I’m just going to hope that that’s not what’s happened. I hope [every attendee] walks out if it is.” Soon after Russian forces invaded Ukraine last month, Penn was seen in the country making a documentary for Vice about the war. The actor then travelled to Poland, where the majority of people fleeing the war initially arrive. Penn, who has won the best actor Oscar twice – for Mystic River in 2003 and Milk in 2008 – is not personally nominated this year, but does appear in Paul Thomas Anderson’s Licorice Pizza, which is seen as a leading contender for best original screenplay. The 94th Academy Awards return to the Dolby theatre in Hollywood amid continued uncertainty over the attendance of nominees recently diagnosed with Covid. On Saturday night, Lin-Miranda Manuel, who has two films in competition – Encanto and tick, tick … boom! – said he would no longer be able to attend after his wife tested positive. On Friday, the Academy further tightened its rules on entry requirements, announcing that anyone within a five-day window of a positive test would be barred, even if they were now testing negative. The health status of Belfast nominees Kenneth Branagh and Ciaran Hinds, who tested positive shortly after the Baftas a fortnight ago, is not known. The best picture race is an increasingly tight contest between Jane Campion’s lauded western, The Power of the Dog, and Coda, a small domestic drama about a hearing-impaired family in a small fishing town.",Arts/Film,Sean Penn: I’ll smelt my Oscars if Academy doesn’t let Zelenskiy speak,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/27/sean-penn-oscars-zelenskiy-ukraine
3/27/2022,"Companion Piece is a fitting title for Ali Smith’s12th novel, her first after the extraordinary Seasonal Quartet. It’s a book that springs from the same source as its predecessors – written and published swiftly, it is about as real-time as novels get, set in the heart of lockdown in “this land of union-jack-the-lads in the year of our lord two thousand and twenty one”. It feels as if Smith so enjoyed the breakneck speed of writing her quartet that she has produced this: a companion piece. Even the (beautiful) David Hockney cover looks like it was designed to sit on a shelf next to the Quartet. There’s another kind of companionship going on here, too. Like How to Be Both (2014), Companion Piece is in two parts, with the longer, contemporary first section acting as a precursor to a scintillating story-within-a-story set in the time of the Black Death. The two parts of the novel reflect upon and enlarge each other, collapsing time and illustrating the way that problems we think of as being very much of our era – pandemic preparedness, gender identity, workplace equality – are rooted deeply in our collective histories. We begin with Sandy, an artist struggling through lockdown. Her father is in hospital after a heart attack and she has only his dog for company. She visits her father when she can and relies on the kindness of a nurse who keeps her informed of his progress. Sandy is just about holding things together when a figure from her past appears: Martina Pelf. Martina had ignored her at university, but now she calls wanting Sandy’s advice. She begins a tale that turns around a powerfully freighted object: the “Boothby Lock”, a (fictional) artefact that Martina, in her role as the assistant to a museum curator, has just brought back from her travels. Martina tells Sandy that on returning to the UK, she was seized by customs officers – the kind of shadowy bureaucrats who have become a staple of Smith’s fiction. Locked in a padded, windowless room, Martina heard a voice whispering to her, enigmatically: “Curlew or Curfew. You choose.” Martina wants to know what this means, what the story is behind it, and Sandy is good at stories. Sandy’s artistic practice involves “layer-painting” poems, superimposing image upon image to reflect the way a poem builds up line over line. It feels like a metaphor for the way Smith constructs her novels, with scenes and stories accreting over time, generating a vast but insidious power. The tale-within-a-tale at the end of the novel can be understood as Sandy’s response to the original challenge presented by Martina: a story to explain the strange voice in the cell. We meet a young girl, one-time apprentice to Ann Shaklock, the town blacksmith. Now Ann is dead and the girl is lying in a ditch after being attacked by a gang of men. There, at her lowest ebb, she finds a curlew chick: “the wildest of all birds, completely untameable”. She cares for it, this strange creature with its curved bill as if “God kept going with the pen to see how long a beak He could get away with.” There is a curfew in the plague-ravaged town and the girl finds herself drawn to a group of travelling players. She remembers stories that Ann told her, and these help her to survive in a world in which she is even more vulnerable than the curlew chick that she has been caring for. We come to understand that there is a connection between the young orphaned girl and the Boothby Lock, although, as Sandy says, “a story is never an answer. A story is always a question.” The reader is left with many questions at the end, but that feels like one of the points of the book. Companion Piece, like life, is messy, funny, sad, beautiful and mysterious.  Companion Piece by Ali Smith is published by Hamish Hamilton (£16.99).

3/27/2022,"Ah, Tontine Street, once the most prosperous in Folkestone, in recent decades less so. It was here, at the age of 19, that I helped a friend’s father make some brand new “antiques” that he sold in his shop, distressing the lacquer on freshly painted sea chests and the like. There was no clue, back then, that an apparition like F51 would appear at its top end, a silvery, bull-nosed wedge the height of a regular eight-floor building. As its primary activity – skateboarding – requires depth and headroom, it in fact has four generously proportioned storeys. F51 bills itself as the world’s first multilevel skatepark, a place where skaters, cyclists, scooters, rollerskaters and rollerbladers can try out different surfaces, designed to suit skills from beginner to Olympic. There’s also a climbing wall, rising up the inside of the building, and a ground-floor boxing club. All of which has been achieved without any public funding, as the capital costs come from a charitable trust set up by Sir Roger de Haan, whose Saga Group made billions out of selling holidays, insurance and the like to the over-50s. The facility is expected to cover its running costs, while also being available in off-peak hours, for a membership fee of only £1 a month to school-age locals. The idea is to achieve “generational regeneration”, which means giving younger people reasons to love and enjoy a town not famous for its youthful spirit, such that they will be more likely to stay there in the future. To judge by the reactions of the skaters invited to test the facility last week, who appreciated not only its technical qualities but its role as a gathering place for their community, there’s every sign that F51 will do what it promises. There’s also a wonder, for the uninitiated, in the design of the different terrains, by the specialist designers Maverick Skateparks and Cambian Action, places where normal expectations up, down and sideways are scrambled. They contain traces of history in their fabric, memories of teenage improvisations over the past 60 years. There is, for example, a deep concrete bowl, based on the empty backyard swimming pools that Californian skaters appropriated in a time of drought, which comes with the sort of coping you get on the edge of pools and a mosaic strip around the rim, in an authentically 70s-looking orange. Part of the joy of these features is the rattle of wheels on the tiles and their rhythmic bump on the joints in the coping. The “street” park offers scattered abstractions of pavements and railings and benches, liberated from the usual constraints of traffic engineering and from the fear of hitting pedestrians. “Flow” is a lunar landscape of cones and valleys whose doubly curving plywood has been cut and bent into shape with impressive skill. These three types of park – bowl, street and flow – are contained in plain, robust, unheated rooms with orange-painted steel beams and lively murals by artists linked to the skate world. Here, it is hoped a spirit of un-competitive fellowship will reign of the kind that was so appealing in the skateboarding events at last summer’s Tokyo Olympics. These parks are stacked one above the other, with the tall funnel of the climbing wall rising up one side, such that climbers and skaters might glimpse each other’s exertions out of the corners of their eyes. On the ground floor is a cafe, its walls hung with customised and decorated boards that are available to buy, its ceilings bulging downwards with the shapes of the bowl park overhead. Glass walls give views on to a somewhat haphazard streetscape outside. Seen from the outside, the bumps and nodules of the underside of the bowl poke through the top of the glass screen. The design of the building as a whole is by Hollaway Studio, a practice based in Kent and London. It makes the right calls in giving the parks matter-of-fact spaces where they and their users are the stars. Its exterior, of a kind that might once have been called “iconic”, does an effective job of telling Folkestone that something new has landed in its midst. “It’s great,” says a passer-by, unprompted. As a structure designed by older people for the young, it verges on architectural dad-dancing, but none of the actual young seems to feel that. What might have made a good project into a great one would be a stronger sense of connection between the actions inside the building and the town outside. There are reasons why you don’t have big windows in an indoor skatepark – think of Looney Tunes skater-shaped holes in the glass as they crash through it – but it would surely have been a bonus to perform in front of the views of cliffs and sea that you can get from here and not impossible to achieve them. It would be good, too, if some of the inner life of F51 could spill out into its surroundings, which are currently some desultory local authority landscaping and a car park. A large part of the sport, after all, is about creative occupation of city spaces, but at present the building creates a too-hermetic layer between its inner and outer lives. But I’m being picky here. F51 is the most inventive and engaging of several projects that de Haan has backed in Folkestone, in an attempt to raise its quality of life, prosperity and self-esteem, which have included art by Tracey Emin and Yoko Ono, the repainting of house fronts in bright colours, schools and an under-construction 1,000-home seafront development. A strength of his interventions, at least to an outsider’s eye, is that the older spirit of this Kentish seaside town remains intact. So you can still buy antiques in Tontine Street (on whose authenticity I have no wish to cast aspersions) but you can also do your flips and grinds in the shiny tower up the road.",Arts/Art and design,"FI skatepark, Folkstone, review - boarding house gives the seaside a kickflip",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/27/fi-skatepark-folkstone-review-boarding-house-gives-the-seaside-a-kickflip
3/27/2022,"Ginni Thomas is a rightwing firebrand, married to the supreme court justice Clarence Thomas. She is also wedded to the lie that Joe Biden stole the 2020 presidential election. In a recently revealed 10 November 2020 email to Mark Meadows, Trump’s then chief of staff, she opined: “The majority knows Biden and the Left is attempting the greatest Heist of our History.” It was up to Meadows to help overturn the election. Unfortunately for all of us, Justice Thomas may agree with his wife’s political agenda. In February 2021, Thomas dissented from the rejection by the court of a challenge brought by Pennsylvania Republicans to the results of the 2020 election. He called the refusal by the six-person majority “inexplicable”, even as he acknowledged that the election had been “free from strong evidence of systemic fraud”. Almost a year later, history repeated itself. His was the lone dissent in a January 2022 ruling that blocked Donald Trump’s efforts to shroud White House records from the 6 January special committee. Compounding the question marks, Thomas offered no rationale for his vote. Against this backdrop, Thomas’ capacity to rule on matters pertaining to congressional investigations and elections is doubtful. Moving forward, he should recuse himself from those types of cases. And if that is too much to ask, Thomas should simply resign. The code of conduct for US judges admonishes the federal judiciary not to “allow family, social, political, financial, or other relationships to influence judicial conduct or judgment”. In that same vein, the US code calls for disqualification where a justice’s “impartiality might be reasonably questioned”. By design, the law prohibits the personal from becoming the political. Going back in time, conservatives became agitated when Elena Kagan, a Thomas colleague and Obama appointee, failed to recuse herself in the challenge to the Affordable Care Act. Their argument was straightforward. Kagan had served as solicitor general in the Obama administration and helped map a defense of the law. At the justice department, Kagan emailed Laurence Tribe, saying of Obamacare: “I hear they have the votes, Larry!! Simply amazing.” She was nothing if not overtly partisan. In response, Herman Cain – a candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination – called for Kagan’s recusal and cited to the US code. Over at the National Review, Eric Segall, a law professor at Georgia State University, wrote that Kagan should “recuse herself based on the undisputed fact that her office, the Office of the Solicitor General, and her top deputy … were undeniably involved, from the beginning, in the Obama administration’s litigation strategy”. This time, however, the right is silent. Ginni Thomas is one of them, and then some. She has served as a director of CNP Action, the dark-money branch of the deep-pocketed and well-connected Council for National Policy. To put things in context, at least six current or former CNP members helped promote “Stop the Steal” rallies. Brent Bozell IV, son of the CNP gold circle member Brent Bozell III, was arrested for storming the Capitol. And then there is John Eastman, who clerked for her husband. Eastman finds himself at the center of the post-January 6 storm. He was a member of the Trump war room at the Willard hotel and begged Mike Pence not to certify the election. Eastman was up to his eyeballs in muck. Pence’s chief counsel, Greg Jacob, wrote him: “Thanks to your bullshit, we are now under siege.” Undeterred, Eastman replied: “The ‘siege’ is because YOU and your boss did not do what was necessary to allow this to be aired in a public way so that the American people can see for themselves what happened.” These days, Eastman invokes his right against self-incrimination and battles congressional oversight. Thomas and the right may care to draw upon the legacy of the late William Rehnquist, the former chief justice who presided over the 1999 impeachment trial of Bill Clinton. In the summer of 1974, the supreme court confronted Richard Nixon’s claim of executive privilege in connection with the Watergate tapes, and Rehnquist faced a dilemma. He had previously served in the Nixon’s justice department, and Nixon had referred to him as “Renchberg” in a taped conversation. As a younger man, Rehnquist was a member of the “team”. However, faced with Nixon’s appeal, Rehnquist recused himself. The court decided the case without his input or vote. In the end, the court rejected Nixon’s claim, 8-0. More likely than not, Thomas won’t choose Rehnquist’s path. Placating Ginni, nursing decades-old grievances, and drawing a paycheck is the easier route to take.

The latest expert on our night-time habits is Richard Buxton of Jupiter Asset Management, who last week declaimed: “I’ve been warning for months the net-zero ESG dash for renewables and dissing of hydrocarbons was sleepwalking us into an energy crisis and here we are.” Mr Buxton is in good company. In recent weeks, we have been sleepwalking into climate catastrophe, a financial disaster, into war, a relegation dogfight, a China-style credit system and bond sell-offs. And that’s just a small sample of the online headlines employing this chilling imagery. I find this phrase just a little bit hysterical and horribly overused. Couldn’t we relax and just say “nearing” or “approaching” and put this cliche to bed, as it were?

3/27/2022,"The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has insisted the country does not have “a strategy of regime change in Russia – or anywhere else”, hours after President Joe Biden described Vladimir Putin as a “butcher” who “cannot remain in power”. Blinken’s intervention is the latest White House attempt to walk back the inflammatory remarks Biden made in a speech in Poland on Saturday. In comments taken by many as a call for regime change in Moscow, Biden said: “For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power.” The US president said Putin was “bent on violence”, adding there was “simply no justification or provocation for Russia’s choice of war” in Ukraine. Minutes after Biden spoke, the White House scrabbled to play down his words, saying the president “was not discussing Putin’s power in Russia, or regime change”. According to one official, the speech was not a call to overthrow the Russian president, but rather an attempt to prepare the world’s democracies for an extended conflict. Blinken was even more emphatic when he addressed the issue during a visit to Jerusalem on Sunday. “I think the president, the White House, made the point last night that, quite simply, President Putin cannot be empowered to wage war or engage in aggression against Ukraine or anyone else,” he said. “As you know, and as you have heard us say repeatedly, we do not have a strategy of regime change in Russia – or anywhere else, for that matter.” Biden’s belligerent comments have caused consternation in the US and beyond. Richard Haass, the veteran American diplomat and president of the US Council on Foreign Relations, said his words had been counter-productive and damaging. “The comments by @potus made a difficult situation more difficult and a dangerous situation more dangerous,” Haass wrote on Twitter. “That is obvious. Less obvious is how to undo the damage, but I suggest his chief aides reach their counterparts & make clear US prepared to deal with this Russian govt.” Haass added: “As has been said, you can only go to war with the army you have. No less true is you can only end a war with the adversary you have. That Putin’s Russia has acted criminally does not alter this truth. Regime change may be a hope but it cannot constitute the basis of our strategy.” Tobias Ellwood, the British MP who serves as the chair of the Commons defence select committee, said the comment had been “unwise” and would be seized on by Putin. “It’s for the Russian people to draw this (obvious) conclusion,” Ellwood wrote on Twitter. “Putin/Xi (& many Russians) will now read ‘regime change’ as POTUS’ wider objective – beyond supporting Ukraine. Putin will spin this, dig in and fight harder.” The British government said Putin’s future was a matter for the people of Russia. “The Russian people, I think, are pretty fed up with what is happening in Ukraine, this illegal invasion, the destruction of their own livelihoods, their economy is collapsing around them and I think the Russian people will decide the fate of Putin and his cronies,” the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, told Sky News on Sunday morning.Asked whether Biden had been wrong to say what he had, Zahawi replied: “No, what I’m saying to you is the White House has been very clear on this, the president gave a very powerful speech on this and I think both the United States and the United Kingdom agree that it’s up to the Russian people to decide who should be governing them.” In his starkest speech since Russia invaded Ukraine a month ago, Biden had accused Putin of using “brute force and disinformation” to satisfy his craving for “absolute power and control”. The US president also described the invasion of Ukraine as “a direct challenge to the rule-based international order” established following the end of the second world war. “We emerged anew in the great battle for freedom,” Biden said. “The battle between democracy and autocracy. Between liberty and repression. Between a rules-based order and one governed by brute force. “This battle will not be won in days or months,” he added. “We need to steel ourselves for a long fight ahead.” Biden quoted Pope John Paul II’s 1979 “be not afraid” speech and highlighted eastern Europe’s defiance of acts of Soviet aggression. “The battle for democracy did not conclude with the fall of the Berlin Wall,” the president said. “Today Russia has strangled democracy and sought to do so elsewhere, not just in its homeland.” Biden’s address came as Russia launched symbolic missile strikes on the Ukrainian city of Lviv, 40 miles from the Polish border. On Sunday, the leader of the Russian-backed, self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic in eastern Ukraine said the region could hold a referendum soon on joining Russia. “I think that in the near future a referendum will be held on the territory of the republic,” Leonid Pasechnik said. “The people will exercise their ultimate constitutional right and express their opinion on joining the Russian Federation.” Russia last month recognised the Luhansk and Donetsk self-proclaimed republics as independent and ordered what it called a peacekeeping operation in the region shortly after.

3/27/2022,"It was the kind of spring day in Mayfair they used to write songs about. Beneath a cloudless sky daffodils were blooming in Hyde Park. Blue and yellow, the colours of Ukraine. Everything seemed to be blue and yellow: the Euro Car Parks sign, the police vans and motorcycles, and the hi-vis jackets their occupants wore, but most obviously the hundreds of flags held aloft by those gathered beneath the Park Lane Hilton for the London Stands With Ukraine march to Trafalgar Square. It was not a typical anti-war crowd. With the conspicuous exception of Peter Tatchell, it lacked that class of seasoned protesters that fill out these occasions. Neither Stop the War nor CND, which both want the UK to stop arming the besieged Ukrainians, was behind the event. Instead it was the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, who called for the protest, supported by the decidedly unradical European Movement (president: Michael Heseltine). Rachel, a middle-aged woman wearing a Roger Waters T-shirt, said it was the first demonstration she’d ever been on. “I’m from East Molesey, near Hampton Court,” she said. “It’s not known as a hotbed of protest.” She had come because she was upset and appalled by what was going on in Ukraine. “Maybe it’s naive, but I hope that if Putin sees enough of the world protest, maybe he will stop.” She pulled a face, as if to suggest that this was a long shot. Navdeep Sadra, a student at UCL, had come, as he elegantly put it, “in decency”. He wanted to show solidarity with Ukrainians and with his friends in Belarus and Russia, who did not enjoy the same freedom to protest. He was aware of the argument, voiced by some progressive groups, that Ukraine should stop looking westwards and content itself with being a buffer zone operating within the Russian sphere of influence. “It’s not for us to tell Ukrainians what to do,” he said, sounding wiser than his years. “It’s up to them to decide their own future.” Moving towards the other end of the age scale, there was Melvyn Bragg, standing with his wife, Gabriel. Like many in the crowd, they believe Vladimir Putin felt emboldened to invade Ukraine because the west had remained passive in the face of his annexation of Crimea. “He’s got us in this terror trap,” said Bragg, meaning that the underlying threat was nuclear escalation. “He is not going to push that button,” said his wife. But of course none of us knows that – and Putin knows that we don’t. The hope must be that the Russians themselves can resist Putin’s strong-arm tactics. Among the protesters was Max, an IT worker who carried a placard that read “Russians against the war”. He said that he didn’t know anyone in the Russian community in London who was in favour of the war. At home, he acknowledged, it was a different matter. “Because they don’t know the truth. They just watch the TV, and the information is completely controlled.” Those who know the truth face arrest and imprisonment if they act upon it. Even in the safety of London, Max didn’t want to give his surname or other identifying details. By the time the crowd started moving towards Trafalgar Square, it had swollen considerably. Nothing like the size of some the major protests London has seen, but big enough to take half an hour to pass. It was oddly quiet at first, a peace protest conducted in strolling silence. But the crowd found its voice in Piccadilly, when it came to a halt and the chant went up: “Stand with Ukraine!” The words were repeated over and over, and with each repetition they grew more powerful and moving, until bystanders stopped and joined in. Many of the protesters said they wanted the Ukrainians to know that they were not alone, although a sunny day in London, with people going about their normal business shopping and sitting outside cafes, must seem an awful long way away to the inhabitants of Mariupol and Kharkiv. They won’t necessarily appreciate the British gift for eccentricity and irony on view in the placards, one of which read “I am still disgusted”, identifying its carrier as “Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells”. And what of Richard Gail, a grey-haired football fan carrying a huge Ukraine flag with a Chelsea FC emblem? “I’d rather we were in the lowest league than be owned by an oligarch,” he said. Perhaps such concerns would look a little local from a shelled-out apartment block. No doubt they’ll appreciate the profusion of blue and yellow flags, even if they might wish to have seen many more Londoners holding them. But then they will also know that it’s going to take a lot more than flag-waving to stop this particular war.",News/UK news,March in support of Ukraine in London: everything was turning blue and yellow,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/27/march-in-support-of-ukraine-in-london-everything-was-turning-blue-and-yellow
3/27/2022,"Margaret Beckett became Labour’s first female leader in 1994. Her announcement yesterday that she will retire at the next general election is understandable, even if we in the parliamentary Labour party wish it weren’t true. Her tenure as leader was short, given that she stepped into the role ex-officio as John Smith’s deputy after his devastating death and then handed over to Tony Blair. But for a generation of women and men, she has not only smashed through glass ceilings but also been the steady voice at times of crisis, the holder of the greatest offices our party and our country can bestow and a political survivor with great intellect and skill. In government, as leader of the house, she was often drafted in for media duties, by virtue of being the person most able to get excitable journalists to calm down. At Labour’s annual conference in Brighton last year, I saw her across the hotel lobby, sitting with the paper and some toast. Her husband Leo was with her, as he was at every Labour party conference I have been to. I bobbed down to speak to her and she gave me a shrewd analysis of the various goings-on. Nobody’s judgments are perfect, and no two politicians agree on everything, and that would include Margaret and myself. But I agree with her that a year in the whips’ office, where we both served, is worth 10 on the backbenches in terms of understanding how the Commons, and politics, works. Margaret’s insight has been priceless to us over the turbulence of recent times. Nothing surprises her. Of course, as the last remaining MP who held office in the Wilson and Callaghan governments, she has seen it all before. But she also has acted as a constant reminder of our purpose, from the platform telling a lively activist on the conference floor: “If the most important question on your mind, comrade, is not the difference a Labour government can make, I don’t know why you are here today.” Cue boundless applause from the Labour ranks. Her words were born out of experience. As secretary of state at the Department for Trade and Industry (DTI), she introduced the national minimum wage, providing a legal guarantee against poverty pay for the first time in our country’s history. She also served as our country’s first female foreign secretary. She was there to make changes and she did. Taking office at the time of the Iran deal negotiations was an unprecedented challenge, but her role in making the Foreign Office lead on climate change should also not be overlooked. She broke the mould as foreign secretary, not just in who she was, but in what she did. On a personal note, Margaret’s presence in the PLP has been incredibly important to those of us elected in 2010 and onwards. Though we are progressives, looking to the future, nothing good comes from losing touch with the experience and knowledge of past Labour governments. Every time I have spoken to Margaret, I have appreciated her dedication to stick with parliament and the benefits that has brought to the rest of us. My gratitude for that is only slightly overshadowed by the gratitude I felt at 16, waiting patiently for a Labour government, watching Margaret and her colleagues walk into the cabinet room for the first time, ready to give my generation the government we longed for.

3/27/2022,"For some of the bereaved, the torrent of promotional Mother’s Day emails at this time of year is more upsetting than the day itself. This is certainly the case for Kristian Glynn, whose wife, the accomplished journalist Sarah Hughes, died of cancer last April aged 48. “Those messages are relentless,” he tells me, as he and their two teenage children approach the first anniversary of her death. Mother’s Day was never a big event inside their home and this year Glynn has no formal plans to mark the moment. Instead, with Ruby, 15, and Oisin, 13, he will have the sort of regular Sunday that Hughes always enjoyed. “Her beloved ritual was to have a big meal and a moment of peace with all the newspapers in front of her – and then to chuck all the finished sections into the middle of the room,” he says. Of much greater significance will be the joyful launch at the end of this month of the book Hughes was writing when she died. Holding Tight, Letting Go: My Life, Death and all the Madness in Between is a collection of her essays that has since been completed by writers and colleagues who were close to the author. Hughes’ own powerful writing about dealing with sickness in lockdown, and an earlier piece about enduring two stillbirths are both included, as is a passionate defence of “trashy” fiction and a celebration of the joys of fashion, even when she was in poor health. One particular passage, in an essay by Hughes about memory, closely echoes Glynn’s sentiments about Mother’s Day. Parents, she writes, should not be idolised by their children, even in death: “It is important that they do not see me as Saint Mum, the dead angel in heaven, but rather that they remember me in all my imperfections. Throwing shoes, shouting, losing my temper at just the wrong moment. Loving them fiercely, too, reading to them, checking their homework, making sure that, despite everything they feel wanted and adored.” Elsewhere she writes about how difficult it proved to find the promised consolation in some of the standard, admired texts about death. A book such as Joan Didion’s The Year of Magical Thinking didn’t work for her, Hughes confesses. The problem was it was her who was leaving. Touchingly, she recalls idly wondering in the past which of her friends would not make it to old age. Now the answer was obvious. In Glynn’s own chapter, a fond note that closes the book, he argues it was his late wife’s “great empathy that made her the writer she was”. And contributed chapters from friends and colleagues make it plain just how integral she was to their happiness. Another of Hughes’ key characteristics, an immense appetite for everything that interested her, also beams out from the pages. Among her enthusiasms were Tottenham Hotspur, horse racing, the books of Daphne du Maurier and the television series Game of Thrones. “If she loved something she really went in to bat for it,” says Glynn. “It was a kind of a stream of consciousness when she got going. I can hear her voice when I read the book.” It was as a television writer for the Guardian that Hughes built up an extraordinarily large community of fans, although her work for this Sunday newspaper stretched back to the early 2000s, when she helped put together the sports pages. When we speak Glynn has just returned from Cheltenham races, once an annual outing for the couple. He had fun, he says, but knew it would be different. “There’s lots of things I’m still doing that I’d have done with Sarah. I know they’re never going to be the same. “With Cheltenham it didn’t matter if it was the two of us, or if we met friends there, we always knew we would have a great time.” Glynn, whose family are from Donegal, Ireland, met Hughes in London through their love of sport, but his grownup job, detecting money laundering and conducting due diligence on business clients, soon took them to New York, where Hughes began her freelance writing career. Travel remained important to both of them, even once they had a family. “Holidays were one of our big things. Last half-term I went to Berlin with the kids. If Sarah had been there as well she would’ve known exactly where to go. She just had that lust for life and knowledge,” he says. “Our honeymoon was in Russia and she turned up there with a pile of Dostoevsky; all the Russian classics. She always had a book nearby.” Had Hughes lived, Glynn thinks she would have tried her hand at her beloved historical fiction. “There would certainly have been billowing cloaks,” he jokes. He and the children will continue to do the things Hughes loved, he says. “You get up and you go on, but you don’t forget. People tell me the anniversary next month will be hard, but really it’s hard every day. As I sometimes say to the kids, though, the worst has already happened. She can’t die again.” It was important for Hughes’ book to be published, Glynn says, not simply because she wanted it, but because he knew it would help others. “I knew from the response to things she’d written in the Observer just how beneficial it could be for people.” The published book, as Glynn suggests, is full of Hughes’ life force. And it presents her “scars and all”, as there is a clear-eyed, unfiltered chapter about the marks left on her body by injury and surgery. As a naughty schoolgirl in Edinburgh she had fallen on the cobbles and later knocked her head on a lamp-post celebrating Euro 96. Later came caesarean sections and a mastectomy. Her skin provided, she writes, “a living map of all that I have been through”. Hughes’ journalism, then her body, and now her book are testament to a life packed with adventure and misadventure. She achieved and felt more than enough for one lifetime, but that does not make dying young any fairer.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"A year without Sarah: memory, loss and the pain of Mother’s Day emails ",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/27/a-year-without-sarah-hughes-memory-loss-and-the-pain-of-mothers-day-emails
3/27/2022,"If you want to consider the rise and fall of the charismatic male and can’t face switching on PMQs, you could look at the roles taken by Ralph Fiennes. Munching massive scripts as if they were single lines, Fiennes has used his magnetically prowling presence to light up Hamlet and Coriolanus, Bernard Shaw’s Man and Superman and Ibsen’s The Master Builder. His repertoire is strikingly expanded in Nicholas Hytner’s production of David Hare’s new play, Straight Line Crazy, which has echoes of the Ibsen. Fiennes is the dramatiser of the singular voice; Hare at his strongest, as here, is a playwright who brings not merely individuals, but systems under scrutiny. The career of Robert Moses slices fascinatingly across obvious political allegiances. Though never elected to public office, he was responsible for the reshaping of New York in the mid-20th century, pushing through his plans for the opening up of the city with a mixture of vision, bullying and legerdemain. The two halves of Straight Line Crazy show Moses towards the beginning and end of his professional life. In the 1920s, his plans sound glorious: new parks, beaches made accessible for city dwellers by bridges and expressways. His disregard for regulation looks like leonine contempt for unnecessary bureaucracy. He bulldozes through old money’s vested property interests: Guy Paul is a nicely relaxed Vanderbilt. He wins round NYC’s governor, Al Smith: astute, whisky-swilling and charming, Danny Webb remarks ruefully that he leaves Moses feeling robbed, without quite knowing what has been taken. His young staff are sparky but over-struck with admiration: a fervent Siobhán Cullen as planner Finnuala Connell proclaims that working with him was like galloping across plains on horseback: hey, whoa there! Thirty years on, the schemes look less uplifting. The Cross Bronx Expressway is known as the “heartbreak highway” by residents whose houses fell in its path; they were mainly black. The bridges in Long Island were built too low for buses, so the poor, again often black, were kept out. Grassroots opposition to wholesale slum clearance and utter car dependency is strongly articulated by the author and campaigner Jane Jacobs; Moses is heard deriding handbag activists. Hare is sketchier in this half, scattering too many cameos, but he deals cogently with Jacobs’s case, shaking himself free of sentimental feminism (I bet someone will be saying that women are ovarianly opposed to straight lines), allowing Jacobs herself to point out that her success brought division in its wake as property prices soared. In shirtsleeves and braces, Fiennes begins by muscling his way across the stage as if he might buckle down to demolishing a few walls himself; by the end of the evening, he looks more shrunken in a suit. He is remarkable as an actor in being so uningratiating; it is harder to perform being simply unlikable than it is to play the villain. Moses’s dynamism begins to look like a defence against inner rot. It is bold and unusual for a play to illuminate how people’s lives are shaped not only by arguments but by the space around them, by system and infrastructure. Bob Crowley’s design of bare wood walls becomes covered with white models of the city that, under Jessica Hung Han Yun’s lighting, gradually assume colour and depth. George Fenton’s score, with nervy strings and siren hoots, vibrates with urban anxiety. Audiences in search of further architectural arguments for wide spaces and unobstructed views need only look around them, at the splendour of the Bridge theatre, only five years old but indispensable. The Human Voice is purposefully shorn of social context. The danger of individuals being cut off from one another is its point. Responding to complaints by female actors that his work too seldom allowed them to, well, show off, Jean Cocteau wrote a monologue in the voice of a woman who has been left by her lover. She is making final tidying-up arrangements – emotional and practical – with him. She does so on the phone, which at the play’s first staging in 1930 counted as new technology: it came with a curly cable and a line that could be interrupted by other callers. Ivo van Hove, not a director to hold back from intervention with a text, has added few modernising touches other than a mobile but aims to emphasise the play’s currency by underlining the sealed-off circumstances. Jan Versweyveld’s design imprisons the action behind a huge sliding window. Hello – rather obviously – lockdown. The effect is intriguing, not electrifying: an exercise in what can be done on stage, when what is said and what is seen contradict each other. Of course she isn’t smoking (she has a cigarette in her hand); yes, she is feeling strong (she bites her fist to stuff up her sobs). The part has been played by Ingrid Bergman and, directed by Pedro Almodóvar, Tilda Swinton. A film, starring Danielle de Niese, of Poulenc’s operatic adaptation will be shown on BBC Two at Easter. The only real reason to see this stage version is the fascination that is Ruth Wilson. She comes on in a cartoon nightshirt, shaking the sleeve of an outsize jumper (it is his) on to her arm. She is a contradiction within herself; her voice and her movements argue with each other. Her speech is mostly level, caressing, cajoling, dulcet even when threatening. Her gestures are liquid; she slides across the stage; her face with its flyaway eyes seems about to take off.
