5/9/2022,"Ukraine will prevail over Russia as freedom prevailed over the Nazi dictatorship in 1945, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, will say in a TV address to mark the 77th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day, in which he will accuse Vladimir Putin of falsifying history. In the speech, which will be aired on German TV at 8.20pm CET (7.20pm BST) on Sunday, Scholz says the “legacy of 8 May” for his country must be to help to ensure that there will never again be genocide or tyranny in Europe. “I am deeply convinced. Putin will not win the war,” the centre-left politician says. “Ukraine will prevail. Freedom and safety will win, just like freedom and safety triumphed over servitude, violence and dictatorship 77 years ago.” Scholz says it is “falsifying history and disgraceful” of Russia’s president to equate his own “barbaric war of aggression” with the fight against National Socialism. “It is our duty to state this clearly,” his speech says. In keeping with previous postwar German leaders’ messages on 8 May, Scholz thanks the Allied forces for their defeat of Nazi Germany, and says his country owes a debt to both Russia and Ukraine, which suffered millions of casualties in the second world war. Scholz has repeatedly declared Germany’s support for Ukraine’s defensive effort but diplomatic relations between Berlin and Kyiv have been frosty. Ukrainian diplomats have accused his left-liberal coalition government of stalling over embargoes on Russian energy and deliveries of military hardware. The chancellor, meanwhile, appeared personally piqued after Germany’s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, previously a Social Democratic party (SPD) ally, was told last month he was not welcome to visit Kyiv along with eastern European leaders. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said last week he had made up with Steinmeier and invited Scholz to pay a symbolic visit to Ukraine’s capital on 9 May. The German leader did not give any indication on Sunday of whether he was likely to accept or not. Several European politicians have visited Ukraine since the start of the war in late February, including the leader of the German parliamentary opposition. Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, made a surprise visit to Irpin on Sunday, and the US president’s wife, Jill Biden, met Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, during an unannounced visit to the west of the country. In what she called an “icebreaker” visit, the president of the Bundestag, Bärbel Bas, also travelled to Kyiv on Sunday to commemorate the victims of the second world war, laying wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier with her Ukrainian counterpart, Ruslan Stefanchuk, the chair of the Verkhovna Rada. “To me this day is special because it does not merely commemorate but should serve to reconcile,” said Bas, whose presiding role over sessions in Germany’s legislature is comparable to that of the speaker in other parliaments. The SPD politician said her visit was meant to commemorate all victims of the second world war, those in Ukraine as well as Russia, Poland, Belarus, the Baltic States and other states in central and eastern Europe. Public figures in Berlin, meanwhile, stayed away from gatherings to mark the anniversary of Nazi Germany’s surrender over fears that commemorative events could be used for propaganda purposes. “The situation is very oppressive, and any commemorations have to take that into account,” said Berlin’s mayor, Franziska Giffey, justifying her and her senators’ absence at the traditional laying of wreaths at the Soviet War Memorial in the city’s Treptower Park. The Russian embassy in the German capital, which has organised the event in the past, has not made its plans public this year because of security concerns. Germany’s surrender is traditionally celebrated in western Europe on 8 May, but because time zones it is marked on 9 May in Russia, Belarus, Serbia and Israel. Berlin’s senator for interior affairs, Iris Spranger, said police would seek to suppress any public displays of support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 8 and 9 May, including the beeping of horns at car rallies. About 1,000 people attended a pro-Russia rally at Cologne’s Fühlinger lake on Sunday, waving the red-white-and-blue flag of the modern Russian republic and the red flag of the former Soviet Union. The display of Russian flags in the vicinity of 15 memorial sites in Berlin was banned. The city’s decision to also include Ukrainian flags in its ban has been heavily criticised by the country’s ambassador to Germany. Andrij Melnyk said the ban, which exempts flag displays by diplomats, was “a slap in the face of the Ukrainian people”.",News/World news,"Ukraine will prevail as Europe did in 1945, Scholz to say in VE Day speech",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/08/ukraine-will-prevail-as-europe-did-in-1945-scholz-says-in-ve-day-speech
5/9/2022,"Only by learning from the past’s mistakes can we hope to avoid repeating them. That is why public inquiries have become part of the machinery of the British state and society. Live inquiries include those on the Grenfell Tower fire, the Manchester Arena attack, undercover policing, and child sexual abuse. Scrutiny of the UK’s Covid-19 response and its glaring failures is anxiously awaited. That 20,000 responses to a consultation on the inquiry’s terms of reference have poured in from bereaved families, frontline workers, their representatives and others indicates the strength of interest and feeling. Heather Hallett, who will chair the inquiry, has yet to feed back to ministers. But if the process is to gain people’s confidence, its terms should be adjusted to reflect the public response. The many social injustices thrown into brutally sharp relief by the pandemic must be a strong focus of any meaningful investigation. So politicians, as well as Lady Hallett, should be worried that the leaders of several black, Asian and minority ethnic groups do not believe that the effects of race and racism will be given sufficient weight. In a letter, they have called for an examination of racism to be a “specific programme of work”, rather than subsumed under a broad commitment to look at disparities relating to protected characteristics, which also include disability, age, pregnancy and maternity. Other inequalities besides racial ones require scrutiny. And racial inequalities overlap with other issues, notably economic marginalisation. But the letter writers have a strong case. Much higher rates of death and illness, as well as the uneven impact of the disruption to education and many other areas of life, are likely to add up to a long-term effect on race equality, they note. Their complaint also raises a wider question about public inquiries more broadly. The retired judges who lead these processes are, while far from representative of the population, experienced public servants with a degree of independence. When bureaucracies are implicated in wrongdoing, an inquiry can – as has been proved in the past – be an effective way to get at the truth and ensure some measure of accountability and improve practice in future, potentially saving lives. But if the Covid-19 inquiry is to deliver results in a reasonable timeframe, Lady Hallett will have to decide where to focus. The scope of the task before her is vast. The list of topics to be covered includes many of the key decisions taken by the UK government over the past two years, as well as scrutiny of the health and care system. The job now is to decide on priorities, and in doing so to build trust with the families and communities for whom the inquiry has the deepest significance. Following last month’s high court ruling that the government’s instruction to discharge people from hospitals into care homes without testing them for Covid was unlawful, finding out how this dreadful decision was reached must be high on the list. Pandemic policymaking will be explored in other places too. Parliament has a role to play, while the sociology professor and journalist Gary Younge has proposed that the links between racism and Covid could be discussed at public meetings. None of these mechanisms will be sufficient on its own. Their effectiveness will depend on how much public and political will can be mobilised behind them. Lady Hallett’s next moves are crucial.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the Covid inquiry: looking for justice | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/08/the-guardian-view-on-the-covid-inquiry-looking-for-justice
5/9/2022,"Sam Kerr highlighted the importance of visualising herself scoring in the biggest moments after two outstanding volleys helped Chelsea to secure the Women’s Super League title. Kerr’s first – to level the score with Manchester United at 2-2, 50 seconds after the break – was a left-footed volley lashed into the top corner. Her second was even more special, controlled with her chest before she turned and looped a volley over the United goalkeeper Mary Earps. “The second one was world class, it was outrageous, audacious,” the manager, Emma Hayes, said. “She’s the best for a reason and she stepped up once again for this football club. I said: ‘Come to Chelsea and you’ll win trophies,’ and I can sit here confidently and say we both made the right decision. I don’t know what words I could use to sum up this person next to me.” “Harry!” interjected Kerr, who was sitting with Hayes’s young son on her lap. “Apart from being the best babysitter in the world,” said Hayes. “She knows she can cope with these situations and deliver when it really, really matters. And, most importantly, have joy in what she’s doing.” Arsenal began the day one point behind the title holders and needed Chelsea to slip up in order to overtake them on the final day of the season. But despite a 2-0 win at West Ham for Jonas Eidevall’s side, Kerr’s heroics were enough to seal a third successive title for their rivals. The Australian forward said she knew the goal was coming: “Everyone thinks I was surprised at scoring that goal but I told Erin Cuthbert: ‘I’m going to score an unbelievable goal tomorrow, I’m going to chest it down and volley the ball.’ I said that yesterday to Erin. I visualise, but I actually think today it both worked in my favour and not in my favour because I visualised too much in the first half and it wasn’t going my way and I felt tired, I felt nervous, and in the second half we just cleaned it straight.” With United twice taking the lead through goals from Martha Thomas and Ella Toone, Hayes was so unhappy with the way the first half was going that she thought about making changes early. “I really nearly did make subs [on] 30 minutes,” she said. Instead, she waited and made two changes at half-time. “I wanted to give the team the opportunity to try and see if we could dig something out. I don’t panic. It’s not in my nature.” On came Ji So-yun and Beth England to link things together better, but it was the confidence which courses through the team that was the game changer. “I’ve never, ever in my career been in a position where things are tight at 2-2 and a player [Kerr] has run over and said: ‘Today it’s our destiny, it was always our destiny today,’” Hayes said. “I said: ‘We’re not winning yet, it’s 2-2 not 3-2.’ But that’s confidence then, and I think once that set in, these guys know better, it was a good response from the dressing room.” Kerr said: “Once we started playing in that second half I just kind of knew that we were going to come back, there was no stopping us, because when we get going like that I don’t think many teams can go with us.”",Sport/Football,Emma Hayes lauds ‘outrageous’ Sam Kerr volley after Chelsea win WSL,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/08/emma-hayes-lauds-outrageous-sam-kerr-volley-after-chelsea-win-wsl
5/9/2022,"As a volunteer working alongside the Red army as they fought their bloody battles against Nazi Germany in Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine, Livdmyla Lishtvanonva, 99, would pick up unexploded shells and ammunition with her bare hands to help clear the streets for the fighting men and women. “Even off the roofs of buildings,” she recalls with a smile. “We were fighting for our land.” Kharkiv, eight decades ago, as it is today, was the location for fierce battles in which many lives were lost and Lishtvanonva says that she and her mother, a nurse, had to leave their home city for a village on its outskirts after their apartment was destroyed in a bombing raid. Lishtvanonva laments that the last two months, particularly the sounds and sights of shelling, have brought such memories flooding back. This weekend, as Ukraine quietly marked a day of remembrance and reconciliation and Russia prepared for a more raucous Victory Day to commemorate the defeat of Nazi Germany, those reflections are all the more poignant. But there are new memories now. From the window of her sparsely decorated room in the Kyiv nursing home in Chaiky village, on the western outskirts of Ukraine’s capital, near the now infamous and devastated towns of Irpin and Bucha, Lishtvanonva watched just a few weeks ago as a neighbouring business centre went up in flames after being hit by a missile. Like the other 160 residents at the home, she spent days in its dusty and dark basement at the height of the battle and later had to be evacuated to the city centre when Russian soldiers on 8 March climbed over a perimeter fence to launch their drones from its leafy grounds. “We had a problem with rubbish as it wasn’t being collected so I was digging a big hole in the ground to put it all in when suddenly I saw Russians climbing over the fence”, recalls Evhen Kryvtsov, 38, the director of the institution. “I was in a big hole with a shovel. I thought my time might be up.” Thanks to the Ukrainian defence of Kyiv, the Russian stay at the home turned out to be brief, and Ukraine’s victory in battle allowed everyone to return three weeks ago. Tetiana Rudyk, 42, the home’s deputy director, laughs as she admits that the staff had checked behind every curtain and in every room for hiding Russian soldiers. But there is deep grief felt by the three women living here who are old enough to have memories of the war with Germany. Lishtvanonva, who lives in room 407, says she has always thought of herself as Russian and “won’t pick a side”. “It is like any other war – it is two political parties fighting because someone wants to be noticed,” she says. But Lishtvanonva adds: “We were fighting for peace [in the second world war]. I just want peace. Building is a lot more difficult than destroying.” Maria Lebid, 94, in room 406, who picked up a gun for the Red army is too ill to talk at any length, but cries when the war is raised, as does Valentyna Lits, 94, in room 444, who says she cannot understand how such brutal conflict has again come to the country – and via Russia of all places. Lits’ father, Pavel, was in the artillery corps in the Red army during the fighting around Kyiv in the 1940s and she remembers a letter he wrote in which he spoke of being ordered to shell an area in which Russians soldiers were in close combat with the Germans. “He said that he didn’t know if his own people had survived,” Lits says. She has two grandsons in Russia in their 40s. They don’t talk about the conflict with her when they call, she says, although one of them appears to believe in Putin’s “special military operation”. Yet, Lits’ who has interrupted her reading of some old newspaper cuttings about healthy living in order to reminisce and share her thoughts, appears almost embarrassed to admit that what she reads and hears about in the news has filled her with an emotion that had been alien and unthinkable to her until now. “Throughout my life, I was fine with Russians,” she says, pausing to control her emotions. “I took some anxiety pills before you came but it isn’t working,” she adds, before continuing: “My husband was from the far east of Russia and his mother didn’t want him to marry a Ukrainian but I was fine with Russians. Now, I see and hear what is happening, the murder and rape, the death of children, and I feel hate, I am filled with hate. And I never thought I would hate Russians, never.”",News/World news, ‘I am filled with hate’: Kharkiv battle evokes memories of second world war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/08/ukraine-kharkiv-battle-evokes-memories-second-world-war
5/9/2022,"The UK is under pressure to insist India release Jagtar Singh Johal, a British citizen, after a UN working group ruled he had been arbitrarily detained by India and his detention lacked any legal basis. Boris Johnson apparently raised the case when he met the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, last month and provided a written note of consular cases, but Foreign Office ministers have not confirmed whether they regard his detention as arbitrary. Johal was arrested after his wedding in the Punjab in November 2017, accused of helping to fund a Sikh-on-Hindu assassination plot – something that he and his family strongly deny. In what is being described as a watershed moment in the case, the UN panel on arbitrary detention concluded that the “continued pre-trial detention of Mr Johal lacks legal basis, and is arbitrary” because he was abducted by plainclothes officers without an arrest warrant, held incommunicado and denied consular assistance or access to a lawyer. They observe that there is “no judicially admissible evidence against Johal, despite intelligence agencies having over three years to investigate” and conclude that “the appropriate remedy would be to release Johal immediately”. Johal has claimed he was tortured and forced to sign blank confession statements, and then had extra charges laid against him that had now reached a total of nine cases. He was transferred to Nabha maximum security prison, where he remained until 25 May 2019, before being transferred to a prison in Delhi. The UN report says that despite being in jail for more than four years he has not been charged and no admissible evidence has been produced. The report by the UN working group on arbitrary detention claims “Johal was targeted because of his activities as a Sikh practitioner and supporter and because of his activism writing public posts calling for accountability for alleged actions committed against Sikhs by the authorities”. It adds that he “was deprived of his liberty on discriminatory grounds, owing to his status as a human rights defender and based on his political activism, religious faith and opinions”. The Indian government denies torture, and says it is still compiling evidence in the cases. Jagtar’s brother Gurpreet Singh Johal, who has been fighting for his release, was elected a Labour councillor in the Scottish local elections in Dunbarton last week. He said: “We’ve known from the start that there’s no good reason for Jagtar’s imprisonment and in four years the Indian authorities haven’t produced any evidence against him. The UK government hasn’t listened to us, but perhaps it will listen to the UN and call for his release. There have been so many setbacks but on a day like this, we’re dreaming of the moment my brother steps off a plane in Scotland to be reunited with his family.” The co-executive director of the human rights group Reprieve, Maya Foa, said: “This is a watershed moment. There is no longer any excuse for the government’s continued failure to call for Jagtar’s release and return. When a British citizen is tortured and held in pre-trial detention for four years, facing a potential death sentence, the prime minister’s responsibility is clear. What is Boris Johnson waiting for?” The Foreign Office says it has raised the case more than 70 times at various levels and that the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has offered to meet the family to discuss the case.",News/World news,UK urged to act after UN panel rules detention of Briton in India ‘arbitrary’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/08/uk-urged-to-act-after-un-panel-rules-detention-of-briton-in-india-arbitrary
5/9/2022,"Emma Raducanu says that she is still “managing” the back issue she sustained last week in Madrid and the various niggles that have come with her first season on tour as she prepares for the Italian Open to begin on Monday. “I think it’s just coming from a lot of intensity and overload,” Raducanu said. “My back, I’m managing it. Like it’s fine. But it’s just trying to adapt again to the long matches, to the intensity. I think that all of the small sort of niggles I’m getting, they’re all related and connected to each other, when something is overcompensating perhaps. Yeah, we’ll see.” Raducanu had earlier played out a practice set with Veronika Kudermetova of Russia in the shadow of Rome’s vast Court Centrale. Between points, she and Iain Bates, the Lawn Tennis Association’s head of women’s tennis, discussed technique and tactics but along with her longtime physio, Tom Cornish. They also constantly laughed together after wild misses and spectacular winners alike. Their jovial mood starkly contrasted with the impassive demeanour of Kudermetova and her husband-coach, Sergei Demekhine, across the net, but even through the laughter it was noticeable how many times Raducanu reached for her back. She may not be fully fit, but one of the realities of professional tennis is that most players are carrying some sort of niggle. She plays on. Raducanu arrives in Rome having performed above expectations so far in her first clay court season, winning two matches in both Stuttgart and Madrid. This is Raducanu’s first time seeing the picturesque Foro Italico – uncomfortably once known as Foro Mussolini – and the courts themselves will be a different challenge altogether. Stuttgart, played indoors on courts infused with oil, and Madrid, where the ball flies at altitude, are some of the fastest clay court conditions on tour and helpful for players who have honed their games on faster surfaces. Rome is far closer to what people envision as clay court conditions: thick, heavy surfaces that smother the ball and slow it down, promoting long, attritional rallies and forcing players to outmanoeuvre their opponents instead of hitting through them. None of that was lost on Raducanu despite being in Rome for just a couple of days. “I think here is completely opposite,” she said. “It’s quite heavy and slow, so there’s going to be a lot longer points. It will be interesting to see what the differences are. But I can already feel them on the court tennis-wise.” She will continue her adjustments in a fascinating first-round match, with Raducanu and Bianca Andreescu facing each other for the first time. The winner could face an even bigger second-round match, with Naomi Osaka or Sara Sorribes-Tormo next. Before Raducanu won the US Open at 18 in 2021, Andreescu was the sensational breakthrough story on the women’s tour, doing so at 19 years old at the US Open in 2019, beating Serena Williams in the final and after winning two WTA 1000 finals. Both have Romanian heritage and they have naturally been compared to each other but Andreescu now stands as an example of just how difficult following up a first major victory can be. After her various physical issues, Andreescu is only just returning during the clay season after a six-month mental-health break. “Of course, we are both pretty good players,” Raducanu said. “It’s going to be a good match-up, for sure. She’s a great athlete and obviously a champion. She’s got a really good attitude. Yeah, I think it’s going to be interesting.” As Raducanu discussed the match-up to come, she spoke with enthusiasm about the her preparation for Andreescu and how independent her scouting process is now that she is without a permanent coach. To Raducanu, that independent streak is reflected off the court. “I’d describe myself as a loner,” she said, laughing. “No, I mean, I do like being on my own, but of course I love being in groups as well. I can easily and very happily spend a lot of time on my own. I think it’s something that is off-court as well as on-court.”",Sport/Sport,Emma Raducanu ‘managing’ back issue in the lead up to Italian Open,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/08/emma-raducanu-managing-back-issue-in-the-lead-up-to-italian-open
