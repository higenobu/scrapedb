3/15/2022,"Ukrainian hackers and security researchers say bug bounty platform HackerOne is withholding their bug bounty rewards, in some cases thousands of dollars, and refusing to let hackers withdraw their earnings. Several hackers and researchers with affected HackerOne accounts said in tweets that HackerOne is blocking payouts, citing economic sanctions and export controls following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February, but that the sanctions don't apply to them. ""If you are based in Ukraine, Russia, or Belarus all communications and transactions (including swag shipping) have been paused for the time being,"" according to an email from a HackerOne support representative to security researcher Vladimir Metnew, which he tweeted out. Metnew, who is Ukrainian but currently in the European Union, told TechCrunch that his account is frozen. ""I think they blocked payments for everyone who registered from Ukraine,"" Metnew said. Bug bounty company HackerOne acts as an intermediary between the hackers and security researchers who find and report security bugs and the companies that ask for help fixing their products and services. In 2020, HackerOne paid out more than $107 million in bug bounty rewards to researchers, many of whom rely on their earnings as a source of income. Other hackers and researchers who are still in Ukraine are reporting similar circumstances, that their accounts are frozen or that they cannot withdraw funds. Bob Diachenko, a Ukrainian security researcher whose findings have been periodically reported on TechCrunch, said in a tweet that he had $3,000 in earnings since February currently withheld from his account. The move to block payouts across Ukraine has been met with anger and confusion, and without any apparent official communication from the bug bounty company. It's not clear what sanctions or export controls HackerOne is referring to. The U.S., the European Union and several other allied nations have imposed stiff economic sanctions against Russia and Belarus, as well as an embargo on territory in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine currently held by separatist groups and Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. But Ukraine is not subject to those sanctions. One affected Ukrainian hacker who goes by the handle kazan71p said in a tweet that they are ""not from Crimea or Donbas ... you just suspended all Ukrainian accounts, you just put the whole country under sanctions,"" referring to HackerOne. HackerOne has not said why it blocked payouts to Ukrainian hackers and researchers or cited the specific sanctions it believes apply. When reached several hours before publication, a HackerOne spokesperson was unable to immediately comment or answer our questions. TechCrunch will update if and when we learn more. The account freezes appeared to come into effect around the time that HackerOne chief executive Marten Mickos said in a since-deleted tweet thread that HackerOne would ""re-route"" earnings for hackers living in sanctioned countries — notably Russia and Belarus — to charity since sanctions prevent the company from transacting with those residents. One hacker, who goes by the handle xnwup, said HackerOne is taking $25,000 in earnings ""because I am a Belarusian citizen."" The hacker, who expressed their support for Ukraine but feared for their safety due to speaking out against the Belarusian regime, said their earnings were the ""result of years of hard work."" Mickos recanted his comments about re-routing funds in a new tweet thread, now offering to donate hackers' rewards only with their permission.

""How do you stop [Russian President] Vladimir Putin without starting World War III"" host Bret Baier asked Risch, who is the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ""There's no doubt that you always have to keep in mind that you don't want to escalate to direct confrontation with Russia, [but] I wouldn't call it 'World War III,'"" Risch said. ""I think it'd end pretty quickly, because with the conventional forces that he's had there, we haven't seen this kind of ineptness in a long, long time,"" he continued. Despite large advantages in manpower and weaponry, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has not progressed as quickly or as smoothly as many experts predicted. Sébastien Roblin wrote at The Week that Russia's performance in the war so far has ""gravely degraded Russia's military position in Europe — and above all its ability to compel with threats of force that fall under the nuclear threshold."" Putin has not shied away from making such threats. In his speech announcing the invasion of Ukraine, Putin threatened any country that attempted to intervene with ""consequences … such as you have never seen in your entire history,"" which most observers interpreted as a reference to Russia's 6,000-warhead nuclear arsenal. But not everyone takes Putin's nuclear threats seriously. ""Putin knows that no one wins a nuclear exchange. If he ordered a strike on the United States, a general would shoot him in the head,"" Sen.

3/15/2022,"Nobody wants to hear the word cancer from their doctor, but in many cases it's no longer the death sentence it once was thanks to new treatments and early detection screenings. That said, cancer cases are rising according to Dr. Liudmila Schafer, an associate professor of medicine and published board-certified medical oncologist specializing in gastrointestinal cancers with over 20 years of experience and founder of The Doctor Connect who spoke with Eat This, Not That! Health. ""The field of oncology is rapidly growing as the average age of the U.S. population steadily rises and the number of patients diagnosed with cancer continues to increase. Although the median age at diagnosis is 71 years and 40% of cases diagnosed are in patients older than 75, there have been increasing incidences of colon cancer among people younger than 50. Globally, five-year survival rates for all cancers increased from 50.5 to 67 percent."" Dr. Schafer explained to ETNT! Heath what cancer signs to watch out for and why cancer is more treatable today. Read on—and to ensure your health and the health of others, don't miss these Sure Signs You've Already Had COVID. 1 Dr. Schafer says, ""wasting syndrome is the loss of fat and muscle that causes weight loss. Cancer causes the immune system to release chemicals into the blood that causes inflammation and speed the process of loss of fat and muscle, commonly in cancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract, including the esophagus, stomach, and pancreas."" 2 ""It happens because the mucosa of the gut gets damaged as a barrier,"" says Dr. Schafer. ""Cancer inside the bowel weakens the lining that is the barrier to the gastrointestinal tract. Cancers in the esophagus, stomach, colon, or rectum may cause bleeding."" 3 Dr. Schafer explains, ""Mass in the colon keeps your stool from moving through in its normal shape as a sign of colon cancer. "" 4 According to Dr. Schafer, ""Cancer in the colon or rectum causes stretching of the bowel wall and causes pain or spasms. Cancer can make holes in the colon wall that cause pain in the belly."" 5 ""In the colon, tumors can prevent the digestive contents from moving forward, causing the food to go back up. For this reason, nausea and vomiting occur,"" says Dr. Schafer.  6 Dr. Schafer explains, ""Cancer is much more treatable today because of awareness of the symptoms early. If you're able to detect early, you will have a less-invasive surgery, with a faster recovery time, fewer medical bills, a greater chance for long-term survival, and a normal and healthy life. We have made great strides in recent years to treat cancer because there are promising new advances in colon cancer research, including an active clinical trial to create a more personalized treatment. Just because you're diagnosed with Colon Cancer, doesn't mean you should make premature decisions based on what you've heard from someone else with the disease. Make sure to ask your doctor about molecular tests that help identify which clinical trial you're eligible for."" RELATED: Virus Experts Sound Alarm Over These Unknowns 7 To prevent cancer, schedule a screening,"" Dr. Schafer states. ""People don't like to ""show their butt,"" but scheduling a colonoscopy is a very safe and necessary procedure that can literally save your life. Despite the age being 45 years old, we recommend anyone younger than 45 who is experiencing symptoms to get screened as well."" RELATED: Here's How to Stop Aging, Say Experts 8 It's important that people talk to their family and learn their family history,"" Dr. Schafer reminds us.

3/15/2022,"Fox News correspondent Benjamin Hall was hospitalized Monday in Ukraine after he sustained injuries while reporting on the ongoing Russian invasion, the network confirmed. “We have a minimal level of details right now. But Ben is hospitalized and our teams on the ground are working to gather additional information as the situation quickly unfolds,” Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott wrote in a note to staff, which was read on-air by anchor John Roberts. “The safety of our entire team of journalists in Ukraine and the surrounding regions is our top priority and of the utmost importance.” According to Scott’s memo, which The Daily Beast obtained and reviewed, Hall sustained his injuries outside of Kyiv. The network later provided Scott’s note when reached for comment. “This is a stark reminder for all journalists who are putting their lives on the line every day to deliver the news from the war zone,” she concluded the note. “Please keep Ben and his family in your prayers.” Prior to the network’s confirmation that Hall had been injured, a Ukrainian official had posted to Facebook a censored image of Hall’s press pass while stating that a British journalist had been hospitalized with “serious injuries.” News of the Fox News reporter’s injuries outside of Kyiv comes as journalists have come under fire while reporting on the increasingly dangerous Ukrainian war zone. On Sunday, acclaimed documentary filmmaker and journalist Brent Renaud was killed in nearby Irpin. Renaud, along with journalist Juan Arredondo, was shot outside of a checkpoint. Arredondo, who was wounded, said the two had tried to cross a bridge to film fleeing refugees when they were attacked by Russian forces. Hall gained some attention last week after forcefully defending his network’s Ukraine coverage against criticism from his own Fox News colleague, host Greg Gutfeld, who suggested the news media is emotionally manipulating audiences to sell a pro-war narrative. Hall responded on-air that devastating events the media has reported on in Ukraine are “absolutely what’s happening” in the war-torn country. “Speaking as someone on the ground, I want to say that this is not the media trying to drum up some emotional response,” Hall declared while on-the-ground in Kyiv. “It’s an absolute catastrophe and the people caught in the middle are the ones suffering.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

3/15/2022,"A legislative proposal to anoint the Bible as Oklahoma’s “official state book” is not only unconstitutional, it is also an affront to true religious freedom. House Bill 3890, introduced by Rep. Tammy Townley, has been given the OK by a House committee. If the bill receives legislative approval, the Bible would be designated the state’s official book from Nov. 1 of this year. The bill violates both the Oklahoma and the U.S. constitutions. Imagine the uproar and consternation that would attend the introduction of a resolution to designate the Quran as Oklahoma’s “official state book.” It is equally contrary to our nation’s religious freedom to single out the Christian Bible. Under the First Amendment, citizens are free to choose any “holy book” they like, or none at all — the choice of the 26% of the American population that is currently religiously unaffiliated. The United States was not founded on the Bible or any “holy book,” but on our secular and godless Constitution, which grants sovereignty not to a deity or a “holy book” but to “We the People.” The Founders were well aware of the horrors of the Inquisition, the Crusades, the Thirty Years War, the witch hunts and the persecution of various faiths in the individual colonies. That’s why they wanted no part of religion in government. HB 3890 is fiscally irresponsible, too, as it would almost certainly result in a preventable lawsuit that would cost state taxpayers dearly. Religious faith is a matter for private conscience, not state endorsement. In his decision upholding the Freedom From Religion Foundation’s challenge of Christian indoctrination in Rhea County public schools in Tennessee, Chief U.S. District Judge R. Allan Edgar, of Chattanooga, wisely noted: “A state-created orthodoxy puts at grave risk freedom of belief and conscience, which is the sole assurance that religious faith is real, not imposed.” The Oklahoma state house needs to stop attempting to foist Christianity upon the residents of the state and start working to address their real needs. Annie Laurie Gaylor is the co-founder and co-president of the Freedom From Religion Foundation, a national nonprofit with more than 36,000 members all across the country, including in Oklahoma.

3/15/2022,"By Sarah N. Lynch WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors on Monday asked a judge to dismiss criminal charges against a Capitol riots defendant and release him from jail, a rare admission in a court filing that the Justice Department had violated his legal right to a speedy trial. At the same time, however, prosecutors asked permission to refile the criminal charges again, saying that apart from the Oath Keeper militia members who are facing seditious conspiracy charges, the defendant is facing ""the most serious offenses charged in relation to the attack on the Capitol."" In the filing, prosecutors said they had made a mistake by failing to secure an indictment or criminal information against Texas resident Lucas Denney within 30 days of his Dec. 13, 2021 arrest, as required by the Speedy Trial Act. Denney was charged in a criminal complaint with assaulting or resisting police, obstructing law enforcement during civil disorder and obstructing an official proceeding, among other charges. He spent several months in jail, until the government finally secured an indictment against him on March 7, 2022 - two days after his defense lawyers formally petitioned his release and the dismissal of the charges. During that period, for reasons that were not completely clear, Denney never made an initial appearance in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia as required, despite several failed attempts to arrange for one. ""To be sure, the government failed to comply with the Speedy Trial Act in this case,"" prosecutors wrote in their Monday filing. ""But there is no evidence of bad faith, a pattern of neglect or something more than an isolated incident that resulted from a number of unfortunate factors."" The Justice Department has struggled to keep pace with the sprawling investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol by then-President Donald Trump's supporters, in a failed bid to block President Joe Biden's election win. To date, more than 775 people have been charged. According to media accounts, a U.S. magistrate judge last week scolded the Justice Department for biting off more than it can chew, and saying it should not bring so many cases if it does not have the resources.

Russians are attempting to sell McDonald's menu items online at highly inflated prices, following the closure of more than 800 restaurants in the country. Insider viewed multiple listings on Avito, a Russian classified-ads website, which offered products including Big Macs and McMuffins. Avito is described on LinkedIn as the most popular classifieds site in Russia and the second-biggest in the world. One Moscow-based seller advertised a Big Mac for the equivalent of around $36. The figure is based on exchange rates at time of writing. In Russia, the burger would usually cost 135 roubles, or around $1, according to The Economist's Big Mac index. Another seller recently posted a ""McDonald's Breakfast,"" including McMuffins, potato pancakes, and sauces for around $18. In a listing translated into English, the seller said they were offering the items to ""those who want to enjoy the last taste of a bygone era."" Nothing appears to be off-limits, with some people even attempting to sell ""McDonald's packages."" At the time of writing, one Avisto listing showed a paper bag being advertised for the equivalent of $373. It is unknown if the bag contained any products. The website also contained several other advertisements offering packaging, including cups and french-fries holders. One seller advertised a ""McDonald's signature glass"" for about $74. The closure of McDonald's branches in Russia sparked a strong reaction from its citizens in recent days. Footage shared on social media showed Moscow residents rushing to stores to grab meals before the closures. According to the Indy100, one Russian completely filled his fridge with McDonald's burgers ahead of the closures, per a photo posted on Reddit.

""Actual Russian propaganda. Traitorous. Russia also said the Luger center in Georgia was making zombies.

Gabbard tweeted a nearly two-minute video on Sunday laying out ""the undeniable fact"" that the U.S. funds between 25 and 30 biolabs in Ukraine that are ""conducting research on dangerous pathogens."" The New York Times conducted a fact check on Friday that said the theory that the U.S. is funding biological weapons labs in Ukraine is ""baseless."" ""There is no evidence to support the claims, which President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, the White House, the Pentagon and the State Department have all unequivocally denied,"" the Times wrote, noting that the theory has been promoted by Russian state media, social media users and conservative voices. The newspaper wrote that the U.S. has given backing to biological labs in Ukraine since 2005 ""to prevent the production of biological weapons,"" adding that some individuals have ""misleadingly cited remarks from American officials as proof that the labs are producing or conducting research on biological weapons."" Kinzinger is not the only lawmaker to blast Gabbard, who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) in a tweet on Sunday accused Gabbard of ""parroting false Russian propaganda,"" adding, ""Her treasonous lies may well cost lives."" The Utah Republican did not specify what comments from Gabbard he was responding to, though it is likely he was referencing her claims regarding U.S.-funded biolabs in Ukraine. The back-and-forth between Romney and Gabbard comes as the U.S. and Ukrainian officials are bracing for Russia's potential use of chemical weapons in Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

3/15/2022,"A brave protester interrupted an evening broadcast on Russian state TV network Channel One on Monday with a sign blasting President Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine. “Stop the war. No to war!” the woman shouted as she lifted up a sign reading, “Don’t believe propaganda. They’re lying to you.” A clip of the broadcast quickly went viral on social media, where multiple journalists identified the woman who stormed the studio as Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor at Channel One. She’s reportedly already been detained by police. Ovsyannikova appeared to have recorded a video before the protest, declaring, “What is going on in Ukraine is a crime,” according to a translation provided by The Washington Post’s Mary Ilyushina. “Unfortunately, I have been working at Channel One… working on Kremlin propaganda,” she reportedly says in the message. “And now I am very ashamed. I am ashamed that I’ve allowed the lies to be said on the TV screens… that I let the Russian people be zombified.” Channel One is one of Russia’s most popular state-run channels and pushes Putin’s propaganda about the war in Ukraine. According to Tass news agency, the network said it’s conducting an “internal review” of the outburst. Earlier this month, Russia passed a law criminalizing reports on the invasion that are at odds with the government’s official narrative, threatening journalists with up to 15 years behind bars. In the first two weeks of the war alone, Russia arrested at least 13,000 demonstrators for speaking out against the invasion, which has led to the deaths of nearly 600 civilians, including 43 kids, according to the United Nations.

3/15/2022,"(Reuters) - Russia on Monday passed a law allowing the country's airlines to place airplanes leased from foreign companies on the country's aircraft register - a manoeuvre likely to stoke Western fears of a mass default involving hundreds of jetliners. The bill, signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, has rattled global leasing firms days before a March 28 deadline to repossess aircraft worth $10 billion as a result of Western sanctions imposed following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russian airlines have almost 780 leased jets, with 515 leased from abroad. The new law, part of Russia's measures to combat the sanctions, says it aims ""to ensure the uninterrupted functioning of activities in the field of civil aviation"". It comes after Bermuda and Ireland, where virtually all foreign-leased jets operating in Russia are registered, said they were suspending airworthiness certificates on the jets because they could no longer be sure they were safe. Re-registering jets in Russia would aim to keep them flying domestically by granting access to new safety approvals. But adding Russia as a second host country could put Moscow at odds with international rules barring the registration of civil planes in more than one country at a time. Unless Western lessors agree to Russian requests to release their jets from foreign registries - widely seen as unlikely while they struggle as it is to regain control of assets - the new policy also paves the way for a major contractual debate. ""It is illegal to register an aircraft without proof of deregistration from the previous registry as well as the agreement of the owner. This would be a default under leasing contracts,"" said aviation adviser Bertrand Grabowski. AIRLINE DILEMMA Technically, the new law does not instruct airlines to re-register their planes without the permission of owners led by Dublin-based AerCap, the world's largest air lessor. But experts said it puts the onus on the airline to apply for new registration to keep flying inside Russia - at the risk of poisoning relations with powerful lessors once the crisis is over - or else do nothing and see their fleets grounded. Not all of Russia's 35 airlines, about 15 of which represent 95% of the country's traffic, are relishing what experts have already warned could spiral into aviation's largest default. ""We hope to avoid registering our planes in Russia; we want to return them to leasing companies,"" a source at one of the airlines said. ""The airline would become an accomplice. The law provides a way to register in Russia, but does not oblige the airline to do so....It is the first step to the kidnapping of the airplanes."" Moscow's government insists special measures are needed in the face of sanctions on the economy that President Vladimir Putin has described as ""akin to a declaration of war"". Lawyers say a three-way legal battle between airlines, lessors and insurers could last for a decade. AerCap and other major lessors declined comment on the law. Major Russian airlines Aeroflot and S7 also declined comment. The Russian Federal Aviation Agency said 776 planes were registered abroad as of Feb. 24, the day Russia invaded Ukraine. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" its neighbour. Dozens of older planes that found homes in Russia during the pandemic may never be returned and are said to be worth less than their owners may be able to claim in insurance. But the world's 11th largest aviation market also includes some of the newest jets including a state-of-the-art Airbus A350 delivered to Aeroflot on the day of the invasion. The United States and Europe on one side and Russia on the other have blocked their airspace to each others' airlines. Russia's state aviation authority recommended last week that airlines with foreign-leased aircraft suspend flights abroad, making it harder for lessors to make repossessions. Some 425 jets are most at risk, the consultancy Ascend by Cirium says.
