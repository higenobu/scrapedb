2/18/2022,"I am pleased that this story has finally been picked up by the wider media (The innocent have paid a high price for the Post Office scandal. The guilty have not, 15 February). But what is not being made abundantly clear is that this is actually not a miscarriage of justice, it is far worse: the Post Office was absolutely aware that the Horizon system was flawed but still continued to (a) prosecute subpostmasters on a grand scale for the best part of 14 years, and (b) tell them that they were the only one. The Post Office also took substantial sums of money from the subpostmasters. This is theft and fraud. This is far more dishonest over a much longer period than anything done by Nick Leeson, as one example of many frauds. This was not victimless crime. The Post Office has used every legal device it can think up to avoid any responsibility, thus continuing to ruin the lives of the subpostmasters. It has said that it cannot afford to pay the compensation, so it falls to taxpayers. I am happy that at least some of the tax I pay will be for a good cause. No one has been – or, I suspect, will be – held responsible or accountable. This is a very sad indictment of Britain today. I cannot describe how angry I am about this.David R LewisSittingbourne, Kent   Marina Hyde discusses problems related to the raising of concerns about technological failures. Research shows that the two main reasons why people do not report alleged wrongdoing are fear of retaliation and that any wrongdoing identified will not be dealt with. UK whistleblowing legislation aims to “protect” workers, but only does so by providing remedies once detriment has been suffered. It does not compel employers to investigate concerns even when they are raised through their own procedures, or to rectify any wrongdoing. If we really want people to speak up in the public interest, it is imperative that we amend our law to comply with best practice in other countries.Prof David LewisHead of the whistleblowing research unit, Middlesex University  One aspect of the inquiry that appears to have been overlooked in the media coverage is what this says about our legal system and the extent to which it provides the opportunity for ordinary people to get a fair trial. Given that so many innocent people were found guilty, it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that this is evidence of ingrained and systemic bias in the system.Dr Mark SeneschallGerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire  Thank you, Marina Hyde, for your coolly furious and perceptive column. It is beyond comprehension that officials in the Post Office and the government have been able to destroy the lives of hundreds of innocent people while suffering no penalties. Though I have no connection with the case, I cannot help being ashamed that this was allowed to happen.Ellie WeldTwickenham, London  I have the restorative justice solution. Those in the management hierarchy whom the inquiry finds culpable of what is being described as the worst injustice in living memory should be required, unpaid, to run a sub-post office for, say, a year using the legacy Horizon software. They should be obliged to donate personally a multiple of any accounting discrepancy reported to recompense the victims and/or to charity.John KellyLittle Raveley, Cambridgeshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2/18/2022,"While welcoming the Royal Institute of British Architects’ call for the insulation of 3.3m interwar houses (Report, 11 February), I am reflecting on the refusal of local planning officers to agree to effective measures to reduce the carbon footprint of my “interwar” property, although in this case the wars involved were the Seven Years and Napoleonic wars. There are over 370,000 listed buildings in the UK, listed not by worth but by age. Despite my repeated efforts to replace old and inefficient sash windows with almost identical but double-glazed ones, planners refuse to contemplate such works, recommending instead that thick curtains should suffice. Having already fitted such drapes, I am reluctant to keep them drawn for 24 hours a day, so would call upon Riba to include listed homes to its worthy campaign.Colin BurkeCartmel, Cumbria   I am a retired architect with some experience of dealing with historic buildings. Your article had no reference to the potential problems that retrofitting insulation can have, not only on the building itself, but also, with external insulation, on the character of the neighbourhood. It is essential that we tackle the climate crisis, but the solution of external wall insulation should be treated with caution. There are many papers which advise that retrofitting wall insulation can add problems rather than solve them, particularly with resulting damp. Loft insulation, double glazing and draughtproofing are preferable.Phil EbbrellMold, Flintshire  I was pleased that you included low-carbon heating in the excellent graphic on how to insulate and decarbonise an interwar home accompanying your report. Last October, I had my domestic gas boiler removed and installed an air-source heat pump, and am basking in the results.

2/18/2022,"Novak Djokovic could be allowed to enter this year’s Italian Open despite the men’s world No 1 being unvaccinated, according to officials in Italy. The country’s cabinet undersecretary for sports, Valentina Vezzali, said: “If Djokovic wants to come and play in Rome he can do it,” adding that tennis is “an outdoor sport and the tighter green pass is not required”.  “Perhaps Djokovic will most likely not be allowed in a hotel or a restaurant, but if he wants to play he can play,” said Vezzali, a former Olympic fencer and a 16-time world champion in foil. The cabinet undersecretary added that she did not expect Covid-19 vaccine mandates would be in place by May, when the Masters 1000 tournament takes place in Rome. The news has sparked a row in Italy, with people describing the decision as “hypocritical” and “shameful”. “It sounds like the rules do not apply to everyone,” said a user on Twitter. “You need a Covid vaccine passport to work in Italy, but if you are Djokovic you don’t need one,” said another. On Tuesday, Djokovic told BBC he would rather miss out on grand slam tournaments than be vaccinated against Covid as he spoke in depth for the first time since being deported from Australia last month because of his vaccination status. Asked if he would miss the French Open over his vaccine stance, he replied: “That is the price that I’m willing to pay.” Asked if this was also his attitude towards Wimbledon, he said: “Yes.” The reigning champion will be unable to play at Roland Garros as things stand because of France’s recent adoption of Covid passports. However, it is believed he should be able to compete at Wimbledon in June. The Rome Masters are set to take place in Rome from 2-15 May.

2/18/2022,"Prince Andrew has been dealt another humiliating blow after the city of York said it planned to revoke his honorary freedom of the city after the settlement of a sexual abuse civil case in the US. The prince has held the honour since 1987 when it was awarded in a huge civic ceremony at York Minster that attracted crowds of more than 200,000 people.  The event was hugely significant as it marked the first ducal visit to York in 67 years, and came a year after his marriage to Sarah Ferguson, when they became the Duke and Duchess of York. While efforts have focused on revoking Andrew’s title of Duke of York, his honorary freedom of the city had almost been forgotten until a former council official tipped off the Guardian on Wednesday. The tipoff prompted York city council staff to search the archives and they confirmed on Thursday night that Andrew still has the honorary freedom of the city. Councillors said they would seek to revoke that title in a vote at the next full council meeting on 24 March. Darryl Smalley, a Liberal Democrat councillor and York’s executive member for culture, leisure and communities, said: “Having been stripped of his military roles and royal patronages by the Queen, we are seeking to end Prince Andrew’s links with our great city, including removing his honorary freedom. “York’s unique connection to the crown and the monarch is an important part of our city’s legacy and history. However, as a council and city, we stand with victims of sexual abuse and are doing all we can to end violence against woman and girls locally. “As such, it is inappropriate that Prince Andrew retains his ambassadorial title that is intrinsically linked to our city. The allegations and his associations with convicted abusers are incredibly serious and we are determined to explore all options available to ensure that his links to our city are severed. “I hope councillors across all parties will support the motion to remove Prince Andrew’s honorary freedom of the city of York. Buckingham Palace and the government must then act to remove his Duke of York title. We will be reaching out to MPs to raise our concerns and discuss any possible ways of ending Prince Andrew’s connection to York.” According to reports at the time, Andrew and his then wife attended the ceremony at York Minster to chants of “We want Fergie”. Every family in the city was given the opportunity to apply for tickets, such was the significance of the event. The surprise out-of-court settlement, announced on Tuesday, means Prince Andrew makes no admission of guilt over the claims made by Virginia Giuffre, which he had repeatedly denied and only weeks ago vowed to fight in a US civil trial. The Queen last month stripped Andrew of his military affiliations and royal patronages in an attempt to distance the royal family from the allegations. Nevertheless, he has kept his Duke of York title. The Queen alone cannot remove titles of peerage. Any attempt to remove the title would have to be led by parliament, through a statute passed by the House of Commons and the Lords. Rachael Maskell, the Labour MP for York Central, has said she will try to change legislation in the coming weeks to remove the Duke of York’s title.",News/UK news,York seeks to revoke Prince Andrew’s honorary freedom of the city,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/17/york-seeks-to-revoke-prince-andrew-honorary-freedom-of-the-city
2/18/2022,"What is happening on the ground in east Ukraine? Tensions have increased after Russian-backed separatists opened fire across the line of control with Ukrainian forces, hitting a nursery school and injuring three people. The west says Moscow may be seeking a pretext to openly intervene in the fighting in defence of the separatist territories that it controls. Russia has amassed a force of nearly 150,000 soldiers in the border regions near Ukraine and the US has warned that an invasion could be “imminent”.  What are the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics? The two territories are run by separatist governments widely seen as Russian proxy states inside Ukraine. Since 2014, they have been in conflict with Kyiv, which refers to them as “temporarily occupied territories” similar to Crimea. They have received military and financial backing from Moscow since they declared their existence following the Ukrainian revolution in 2014. The two regions cover an area of about 6,500 square miles and were primarily known before the war for their heavy industry and coal mining. Donetsk, the largest city, previously had an international airport and hosted matches during the Uefa Euro 2012 championship. The fighting has destroyed the airport and left the territories mostly cut off from the rest of Ukraine in a dire economic state. The borders with Russia remain open. What are their relationship to Moscow? Officially, Moscow sees the two states as part of Ukraine and has not recognised their independence but has dealings with the leadership of the self-declared states. Unofficially, the two regions are seen as fully controlled by Moscow, with a leadership installed by the Kremlin, Russian subsidies propping up the economy, and Russia’s military providing protection and arms. Why haven’t they already been absorbed into Russia? Russia has flirted with the idea of recognising the independence of the two regions from Ukraine. But it has stopped short of that or annexing the territories for several reasons. First, they provide Moscow with important leverage in its battle with Kyiv. Russia wants the territories reinserted into Ukraine, but with their leaders having a veto on major foreign policy decisions, like entry into Nato. If Russia recognises their independence or annexes the territories, then that plan, along with the Minsk ceasefire deal signed in 2015, will collapse. Secondly, many Russians don’t feel a strong affinity for the region. While ordinary Russians view Crimea as an important part of their cultural history and the Russian Black Sea fleet is based there, there is little that ties ordinary Russians to east Ukraine. Nonetheless, Russia has given out hundreds of thousands of passports in the area and helped integrate its economy with Russia’s, making it more likely the frontlines will remain static in the future. Who are the people there? Leaked documents suggest there are just under 3 million people remaining in the territories, 38% of whom are pensioners. That’s less than half of the pre-war population. Anecdotal evidence has shown that many of the people who remained behind are those who strongly opposed the 2014 revolution that toppled former Ukrainian leader Viktor Yanukovych (his hometown is in the separatist-controlled regions) and those who are simply too poor or were unable to have fled the area when fighting broke out. Public opposition in the territories is virtually non-existent. It has become extremely difficult for independent journalists to go to the region, first because of restrictions by the local authorities and second because of the difficult of reaching the territories via Ukraine. Earlier this year, a Ukrainian journalist returning to Donetsk for the first time since July 2014 wrote: “Now I feel like a tourist here, the heroine of a fantastic story that flew in a time machine into the past, and when I returned, I found that everything had changed beyond recognition.” How many troops are there? It is not clear how large a force is present on the two territories. Ukraine has claimed that there are “35 thousand military personnel and 481 battle tanks, 914 armoured combat vehicles, 720 artillery systems, 202 multiple launch rocket systems on the uncontrolled territories of Donbass”. According to Rochan Consulting, however, those numbers could be “overestimated”.",News/World news,What is the background to the separatists’ attack in east Ukraine?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/17/what-is-the-background-to-the-separatists-attack-in-east-ukraine
2/18/2022,"Traditional TV cooking shows aren’t really about cooking. They’re about watching, about seeing high-production cheffiness or Gordon Ramsay swear at people. Despite the numerous what-to-watch-in-2022 lists that featured Netflix’s Chinese cooking series Flavorful Origins or Nadiya’s Time to Eat on the BBC, it is rare that you will actually feed yourself off the back of one of them. The same is not true of someone strapping a GoPro to their forehead so they can show you how to make amazing scrambled eggs. Modernist cooking wunderkinds like Kenji Lopez-Alt are using YouTube to make videos that are as immediately instructive as they are zanily entertaining. For all the talk of so-called FoodTok luminaries raking in followers by the millions and earning six-figure incomes, it is YouTube food chefs who are making the best food videos around. They are not constrained, as TikTokers are, by the platform’s time duration or (like television chefs) dictated to by viewing schedules. They can take their time; they can shoot when they want to. No one is telling them what to cook, or what to say. No wonder there are upwards of 1 million food channels. Meet five of the best.  Launched in the summer of 2017, this channel serves as a diary of London cookbook author Rachel Ama’s vegan journey and every dish Ama talks you through is one you want to have a go at. Which is not surprising, given that she explains her reason for starting the channel as: “I went vegan overnight and it was such a good feeling, I wanted the people I loved to experience it, too.” Ama melds the Caribbean food her St Lucian grandmother used to make and the trad British dishes she grew up with in north London with restaurant fare from her travels in Spain, New Orleans and Colombia. She says she is always awkward in photographs, but on video, she has been magnetic from day one. In the second video she ever made, that boundless excitement surges when she realises, on screen, that the faux tuna she’s just demonstrated could actually become a faux tuna melt – the first she’ll have had since going vegan. “Let’s do it, lads,” she gasps and you’re right there with her and that packet of vegan cheese she’s holding up in pure, unscripted triumph. A particular highlight is the high-protein vegan Caribbean feast she posted a few years back, including jerk lentils slightly sweetened with maple syrup and a gorgeously creamy cashew-based mac’n’cheese. The food is so good that after plating up, she forgets herself and eats most of it before realising she has not filmed the tasting. As YouTube food channels go, Maangchi is up there with the most famous, a fixture in Top 10 lists. And yet, 14 years after she first made a dish on camera (ojingeo-bokkeum, stir-fried squid) host Emily Kim has no PR, PA or TV slot. She is still doing it all herself. Maangchi has become the go-to guide for authentic Korean recipes in English, from bibimbap (12m views) to trad kimchi (23.5m), and everything in between – fluffy red-bean buns, steamed eggs, twisted doughnuts, green beans in garlic. She is an excellent instructor, explaining what to buy, how to clean it, when to chop or stir or cover and how long to wait, in clear and simple terms. Kim shoots from her immaculately tidy but otherwise ordinary kitchen in Times Square, wearing fabulous outfits such as a green pillbox hat, a pink wig and fake grape earrings. An actual legion of fans from across the globe agree with her son that she is the best cook in the world and their own adoptive mother. Headlines and tweets variously describe her as YouTube’s Korean mom, the internet’s Korean mother and “Maangchi is my mother now”. The love is reciprocated: “My viewers keep sending me messages, saying ‘Maangchi, I made your chicken and it was a big hit and I was proud of myself,’ and I tell them, ‘I’m proud of you’ and even though I don’t see their face, I’m always thrilled, you know.” Fried rice, flavoured rice, things on rice, homemade dim sum, all the noodles: each new video here feels like an invitation and looks like lunch. Run by a Chinese woman, Stephanie Li and her American partner, Chris Thomas, based in Shenzhen, China, this channel does exactly as its name suggests. “English language sources seem to both overthink and underthink Chinese cuisine,” says Thomas: they try to mimic restaurant techniques, but fail to properly explain the foundational ingredients to a western audience. Li and Thomas’s videos are usually under 10 minutes long, neatly edited with a rapid-fire intro and cooking demo out on their balcony – if they take you inside, they will tell you why, and it is all part of what makes them so helpful. The viewer’s own culinary restrictions are always a priority: they will often give you options for the method (if you have a wok, a gas stove, or neither). They shoot up close with clear audio, to make sure you understand what tiger eggs sound like when they are being deep-fried, or exactly how slowly to turn your scrambled eggs to make them in true Cantonese style. For added homestyle goodness, the couple’s dog, Hayek, sits on a chair beside Li as she cooks on camera. “He’s an intense air-licker when he gets excited,” says Thomas. Chef and baker Jocelyn Delk Adams is a longtime blogger, cookbook author and regular on US TV with appearances on the Food Network and Good Morning America. She is known for very pretty, pastel hued bakes and her videos look and feel exactly like those treats. On screen, she favours gorgeous knits and ice-cream colours; she demos sour-cream poundcakes, buttery cornbread and perfect pie crusts with the easy, welcoming demeanour of an eminently capable host. From creamy grits with shrimp scampi to the deepest reddest crunchiest spiciest fried chicken – well, it’s just beautiful. “When I’m in front of the camera, there’s such a glow and a spark, an enjoyment,” she says. In one of her very first videos back in 2013, she goes back home to Winona, Mississippi to bake biscuits with her grandmother. You watch Delk Adams at the stovetop with Big Mama Maggie, as she was known to everyone, making biscuits as she did every day for decades. It’s an incredibly real, intimate moment – the kind that chefs like to write about in cookbooks, but that no one ever really gets to witness first-hand. “I think about my grandmother all of the time,” she tells me. “She is 100% why I created my entire brand, just wanting to honour her.” The four guys from Hertfordshire who started Sorted Food – Ben Ebbrell, Mike Huttlestone, Jamie Spafford and Barry Taylor – have been making each other laugh over lunch since they were in year 7 together. Back in 2010, on a drunken weekend away in Cornwall, they had the idea to shoot some food videos for some friends who were unable to make the trip. A short while later, they posted a follow-up on YouTube – a lasagne how-to which, much to their surprise, garnered, as Spafford puts it, “comments from people we didn’t know”. Some told them off for not adding milk to the ragu, others for not making the dish like their grandma would have. Every video created since has been a similarly communal effort: burger battles, chocolate challenges, blindfolded taste tests, the four of them often joined by guest chefs, and sometimes, celebs (Emma Thompson turned up in December with her daughter and a Christmas jumper). “It’s mates hanging out, being able to cook and eat great food with each other,” says Spafford. Only Ebbrell is a trained chef, so that means any given episode typically involves him rescuing the messes the three “normals” have made. They have toured the US for NBC’s Today show, published 14 cookbooks, launched an app, convened a community 2.52 million strong, and still they read every single comment. “It doesn’t make much sense commercially,” they agree, but being there for their fans, like they are for each other, is, really, what they are best at.",Arts/Television & radio,"‘When I’m in front of the camera, there’s such a spark’: The YouTube cooks leaving TV chefs behind",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/17/when-im-in-front-of-the-camera-theres-such-a-spark-the-youtube-cooks-leaving-tv-chefs-behind
2/18/2022,"As the 2022 Winter Olympics draws towards its conclusion, once again Norway sit pretty on top of the medal table. It is not just a one-off. Norway have been outside the top four in a Winter Olympics medal table once since 1992 and topped it in 2002 and 2018. But how does this small Scandinavian country continually out-power much bigger rivals? “I mean, we have a lot of cold,” said a joking Sturla Holm Lægreid of the (predictably enough) winning men’s biathlon relay team by way of an explanation. It is not simply climate, though. Sweden, Austria and Switzerland benefit from the same advantage and have larger populations and bigger talent pools to draw from. Geopolitics, budgets and population size dictate that China, the US and Russia always put up strong Olympic teams. What Norway does have is an intense focus on grassroots participation in winter sport from a young age.  Norwegian athletes will often joke they are a nation born with skis on, but cross-country skiing and biathlon are popular televised sports and there are more than 10,000 local sports clubs in Norway. In 2018, the proportion of children regularly taking part in winter sports was put at 93%. Importantly, at a young age the focus is on fun. They do not keep scores for games involving small children, but as they get older there is a huge active talent pool to move up to the Olympiatoppen for elite sport training. “We’re not many people, but we’re a people with passion,” said Mons Røisland after earning silver in the men’s snowboard big air. “There are so many athletes out of Norway and it’s so impressive and inspiring to see what everyone does to be here.” Norway’s success is not distributed evenly across all Winter Olympics sports. The country leads the all‑time medal table in cross-country skiing, ski jumping and the Nordic combined discipline and 12 of their 14 golds in Beijing have come in those three events plus biathlon. They have never won any medals in bobsleigh, luge or skeleton and have not won gold in figure skating since 1928. Team GB’s quest for medals started in earnest after a dismal performance in the Summer Olympic Games of 1996 in Atlanta when the team returned home with one gold. Since then, funding has been funnelled towards sports where there is a decent prospect of medals and national lottery money has poured in. That is an alien approach to Norway, whose overall Olympic budget is a tenth of that expended by Great Britain. In 2018, Morten Aasen, a former Norwegian Olympian, said: “We don’t do skeleton or bobsleigh because that costs too much money. We are a very rich country, but we believe in the socialist way of doing things. That success should be from working hard and being together.” The huge emphasis on camaraderie means the team have little room for ego. This was typified by Johannes Thingnes Bø. He has won three golds and a bronze in biathlon in these Games, with his elder brother sharing podiums with him as he claimed two golds, a silver and a bronze. Yet after a gruelling 10km sprint event at the Zhangjiakou National Biathlon Centre, which the younger Bø led from start to finish, he said: “Some days you just feel like the wax men do half of the work. Today was a day like that.” While it might look from afar that Norway are sweeping all before them, there are some rumbles of discontent about this year’s performance. The team have 29 medals, but it will be a stretch for them to reach the record they sent in Pyeongchang in 2018 of 39. In particular, the performance in cross-country has prompted much discussion back home. Johannes Høsflot Klæbo finished a distant 40th in the men’s 15km + 15km skiathlon despite going into it as a well-fancied favourite. He said: “In the Norwegian media, for sure, it’s been a lot of discussions about many different things. That is not the best or most positive thing for us.” Birk Ruud, a member of the freestyle ski team, thinks the answer is much more obvious. When asked about Norway’s exceptional performances in Beijing, he said: “We’re a country with a lot of good genes and we work hard.”",Sport/Sport,Not just snow: what’s the secret to Norway’s Winter Olympic success?,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/17/secret-behind-norway-winter-olympic-success
2/18/2022,"My grandfather Dennis Lee, who has died aged 91, was a proud Yorkshireman whose love of Shakespeare, opera, jazz and his favourite, Nina Simone, was passed on to his family and friends. He was also passionate about the benefits of education and never stopped learning throughout his life. Born in Sheffield to Ernest Lee, a miner and steelworker, and Edna (nee Poole), Dennis lived in the city his entire life and survived the blitz.  Dennis attended Chaucer secondary school, leaving at 15 to start on the factory floor at the Batchelor’s foods factory, in Wadsley Bridge. He rose through the ranks to become works manager. Aged 28, he was diagnosed with Brittle diabetes, which is one of the most difficult forms of the condition to manage, especially so in the early days of insulin research. He married Barbara Lindley in 1953 and they went on to have two children, Stuart and Denise. When, in 1958, Barbara’s mother died they took in Barbara’s 10-year-old sister, Christine. They were both loving grandparents and my sisters and I would spend many happy hours at their house. I was there almost every Friday night and my grandfather educated me in literature, opera, jazz and – as I got older – late night comedy on BBC Two. Dennis left Batchelor’s in 1987 and worked at Corus Steel as a manager until his retirement in 1995. An ardent Labour supporter, Dennis was not a materialistic man and jokes were made in the family about the creaking of his wallet when he finally opened it. But when there was real need he was generous to a fault, rescuing his brother from debt and putting money aside to help me with the costs of university. In retirement he was a keen fisherman and would take part in local competitions. He enjoyed the theatre and would take us to see opera, musicals, and plays by Pinter and Shakespeare. He loved watching snooker every year at the Crucible theatre. As he entered his 80s his diabetes caused more difficulties. Many doctors expressed surprise that he had lasted as long as he had and in 2019 he was awarded the Robert Lawrence medal for having lived with diabetes for 60 years. Barbara died in 1999. He is survived by his children, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.",News/UK news,Dennis Lee obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/17/dennis-lee-obituary
2/18/2022,"Andrew Neil has launched libel proceedings against Jennifer Arcuri, the former lover of prime minister Boris Johnson, after she made allegations about the broadcaster’s inclusion in an address book owned by the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Legal filings show Neil has made good on his threat to sue Arcuri after she publicly claimed the journalist was on the “pedo elite train”. The former GB News presenter, who is now hosting a show for Channel 4, said Arcuri’s comments were “evil lies” and “vile and untrue accusations”.  Neil has repeatedly said he never met Epstein and his presence of his contact details in the “black book” is because he had previously met Ghislaine Maxwell in New York during the 1990s. Last year Maxwell was found guilty of recruiting and grooming teenage girls for sexual encounters with Epstein. Arcuri came to prominence after claiming she had an affair with Johnson when he was mayor of London, prompting investigations into the decision to award her startup business tens of thousands of pounds in public money. She also accompanied the future prime minister on trade missions, although Johnson will not face a police investigation over the matter. Her exchanges with Neil began as a Twitter row about the effectiveness of vaccines before descending into mudslinging about his supposed connection to Epstein. Arcuri has now deleted some of the tweets that prompted Neil to issue his legal threats but this may be too late. Arcuri, who now lives in the US, is listed as a litigant in person on the high court filings, suggesting she does not currently have legal representative. British libel law places the onus on the person who made the disputed allegations to substantiate their claims. In a series of tweets about Epstein, Neil also told another Twitter user he had no connection to the deceased former financier: “I’ve never even met him, communicated with him, never mind visited any of his properties or been on his planes, cars, buses, helicopters, ponies,” he tweeted. “Now what is it you don’t understand about piss off. And apologise before you do, please, piss off.” He also wrote that he had decided to take legal action “not just to hold Arcuri, who I’ve never met and have no interest in, to account but, more important, to establish that the twitterati can’t just promulgate evil lies without consequences. If you think anonymity will protect you, you’re in for a big surprise.” In a tweet at the end of December, Neil told Arcuri: “My legal team has prepared a massive case against you and we’ll be seeking exemplary damages. Papers will be served in UK and US. I know you’ve been keeping your location private. But tell me, what’s it like in Panama City, Florida this time of year?” Arcuri responded: “This guy is going to give himself a heart attack.”",News/Media,Andrew Neil launches libel claim against Jennifer Arcuri after Epstein tweet,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/17/andrew-neil-launches-libel-claim-against-jennifer-arcuri-after-epstein-tweet
2/18/2022,"There have been more than 1m excess deaths in the US during the pandemic, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The deaths are mainly attributable to Covid-19, as well as conditions that may have resulted from delayed medical care and overwhelmed health systems.  At least 923,000 Americans have died from confirmed Covid cases, according to the CDC. Other causes of death above the normally expected number have included heart disease, hypertension and Alzheimer’s disease. Some Americans also die months after their initial Covid diagnosis, because the virus created other fatal complications. Excess deaths are calculated by looking at previous years’ fatalities. In 2019, there were 2.8m deaths in the US; in 2020, it was approximately 3.3m. “All-cause excess mortality is one of the most reliable and unbiased ways to look at the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and an instructor at Harvard Medical School. “It does not rely on how many tests were done or on subjective cause of death designations.” While cause of death can sometimes be difficult to ascertain, and political pressures can lead to miscounting, excess deaths can indicate the broad scope of a health emergency. “Whenever we hear that another 100,000 people died of Covid, there’s a reliable chorus of naysayers who claim that these deaths would’ve happened anyway,” Faust said. “Excess deaths cuts through that, because it’s about reporting whether the total number of deaths is out of the ordinary.” These figures can reveal the truer toll of Covid – including deaths directly from infection as well as deaths from the circumstances of the crisis. The global number of excess deaths may be millions higher than the official count of Covid deaths. The toll of Covid has been geographically uneven in the US. At first the virus was largely confined to major cities, but then it began spreading in rural areas, with devastating effect. Deaths among working-age Americans are up 40% during the roughly two years of the pandemic, one insurance executive said in December. Many Americans delayed seeking care during the pandemic, and others may have seen the quality of their care decrease as health systems were overburdened by Covid. The US is also in the midst of an overdose crisis, with more than 100,000 overdose deaths in the first year of the pandemic. Excess deaths are also known as untimely or “early” deaths. While the majority of excess deaths in the US occurred among those 65 and older, many of those Americans had many years left to live. The average 80-year-old in the US has a life expectancy of eight more years, Faust noted. “If suddenly more 80-year-olds are dying than usual, it’s a simple fact that many of them had not just months but years, even a decade or more, of life left otherwise in some cases. “Sometimes people say that stopping Covid merely ‘delays death’. To that, I say, ‘Exactly. That’s what medicine and public health are all about.’”",News/World news,"US has suffered more than 1m excess deaths during pandemic, CDC finds",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/17/us-excess-deaths-pandemic-cdc
2/18/2022,"Henry Danton, who has died aged 102, was the last survivor of the six dancers who created Frederick Ashton’s ballet masterpiece Symphonic Variations in 1946. This was Ashton’s first creation for the stage of the Royal Opera House. He filled the work with a flow of movement, challenging his dancers’ stamina and drawing on their individual skills. Danton’s interest in ballet was aroused by seeing Léonide Massine’s Jardin Public performed by Wassily de Basil’s Ballet Russe at Covent Garden in the 1930s, and particularly by the idea of a statue coming to life, but he did not start training in ballet until he was 21.  He enjoyed ice-skating. A friend took him to a rink in Brighton, where he worked with a young partner whose mother introduced him to the ballet teacher Judith Espinosa. She was immediately impressed by Danton’s athletic body (a result of his earlier military training) and turnout (a result of skating) and in 18 months he raced through the Royal Academy of Dancing examinations with honours. In 1942 he was awarded the academy’s Adeline Genée silver award but, because of wartime metal shortages it was not until 2019, when he was 100, that he received the medal. During the second world war, male dancers were in short supply and Danton was snapped up for the short-lived Allied Ballet and then Mona Inglesby’s International Ballet. With both he danced the role created by Vaslav Nijinsky in Les Sylphides, as well as performing new works. With International he benefited from the teaching of the Polish ballet master Stanislas Idzikowski. While he valued his opportunities to dance principal roles, after six months he asked Ninette de Valois if he could join Britain’s premiere company, the Sadler’s Wells Ballet. He acquired a place in May 1944, remaining until 1947, and was a member when it took up residence at the Royal Opera House in 1946. Although he was technically weak in some steps Danton had a strong jump and was happy dancing choreography by Ashton and the Florestan pas de trois in The Sleeping Beauty. He did not get on with De Valois, however. He disliked her ballets – he danced the Rake’s Friend in De Valois’s The Rake’s Progress – and her emphasis on counts rather than the music. He was disappointed, too, by the company’s teachers. De Valois disapproved of his taking classes outside the company with the Russian teacher Vera Volkova, who drew from her dancers an elegant musicality, encouraging them to use their full body and soul, and with whom Danton had an affair. Danton danced with Sadler’s Wells Ballet on tour to Brussels and Paris in February-March 1945. In Paris he discovered another Russian teacher, Victor Gsovsky, who suited him. When he left Sadler’s Wells he returned to Paris. He toured France and western Europe, partnering an étoile of the Paris Opéra, Lycette Darsonval, and followed Gsovsky to the Ballets des Champs-Elysées, one of the most exciting postwar French companies, and then to the Metropolitan Ballet in London. He was born into a military family in Bedford. His father, Charles Boileau Down, a major with the Royal Garrison Artillery, died from war injuries in 1919 when Henry was three months old, leaving his mother, Beatrice (nee Forsyth), to raise three children. Henry and his brother were both educated via a King’s cadetship at Wellington college and the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. Henry had an agreement with his mother that he would accept his military schooling but, once his education was complete, he should be allowed to choose a career. He graduated and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery, but this coincided with the Munich crisis, leaving him unable to leave the services and, indeed, promoted to captain at the outbreak of war. But the army was not for him; he had a breakdown and was released. He later altered his surname to Danton, as Down was not seen as a suitable name for dancer. Nevertheless, his military background accounted for his bearing and his demand for respect. Clearly, he was antagonised by De Valois constantly calling him “boy” and he had sufficient independence to develop his own career rather than toe any line. In the 50s his contacts in the dance world and curiosity took him to New York, South America and Australia. He significantly influenced newly formed ballet companies in Caracas, Venezuela, and Bogotá, Colombia, and embarked on a career as a teacher. Although he lived thereafter in the US, Danton made regular visits to the UK for birthday celebrations, to attend events and reunions, enjoying his status as a senior member of the Royal Ballet. He regarded life as an adventure and loved teaching young people, which he continued to do until he reached 100. He attributed his longevity to his vegetarianism, adopted long before it was fashionable, and to his all-absorbing passion for dance.

2/18/2022,"A judge has approved a decision to allow any transgender person in Scotland to select male or female as their sex in this year’s census without holding a gender recognition certificate. Lord Sandison, a civil court judge sitting in Edinburgh, threw out a legal challenge by the feminist group Fair Play for Women, which had gone to court to block that question from being asked.  Fair Play for Women argued that people were lawfully allowed to answer that question based only on their legally recognised sex, either from their birth certificate or gender recognition certificate. National Records for Scotland, the government agency, will now publish census returns asking the question “what is your sex”, and offer two options of male and female. About 2.5m households will be asked to complete it. Its guidance reads: “If you are transgender, the answer you give can be different from what is on your birth certificate. You do not need a gender recognition certificate.” In a judgment issued 14 days after hearing the challenge, Sandison ruled there was no legal requirement to insist on legal proof of sex for the census, which will be on 20 March. Sandison said government agencies recognised sex and gender in different ways, and as the census legislation did not adjudicate one way or the other on the issue, Scottish ministers were able to set the question this way. “In the modern age, where social change has meant that such issues are much more openly and widely discussed and debated, I would find it impossible to find that the word ‘sex’ in a statute enabling the general population to be asked questions for the wide and general purposes for which a census is conducted falls to be regarded as restricted in the sense for which the petitioner contends,” he wrote. “Rather, I would accept the suggestion that biological sex, sex recognised by law, or self-identified (or ‘lived’) sex as at the date of the census are all capable of being comprehended within the word.” Fair Play for Women said they were disappointed with the ruling and would be pressing for an urgent appeal. “The guidance proposed for the sex question will jeopardise the collection of accurate data on sex in the Scottish census and erodes the harmonisation of data collected via censuses across the UK,” the group said. Vic Valentine, of the pro-trans campaign group Scottish Trans Alliance, welcomed the judge’s ruling. “Scotland’s census is meant to count everyone in Scotland as who they are on census day, and the guidance provided reassures trans men and trans women that this is the same for them as it is for everyone else,” they said. “This is an important decision: clearly stating that all trans men and trans women are able to be counted on the census as who they are, not just those who have changed the sex on their birth certificate.”",News/Society,"Transgender people can self-identify in Scottish census, confirms judge",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/17/transgender-people-can-self-identify-in-scottish-census-confirms-judge
2/18/2022,"Diogo Jota is facing a race to be fit for Liverpool’s Carabao Cup final against Chelsea on Sunday 27 February after sustaining an ankle ligament injury in the Champions League win over Internazionale. Jota underwent a scan in Milan on Thursday after Liverpool, who had planned to return home immediately after the last-16 first leg, stayed an extra night as a result of the storms in England. The scan confirmed some ligament damage but the full extent of the problem is not yet known. Jota’s ankle remains in a protective boot as a precaution.  The Portugal international has been in excellent form for Jürgen Klopp’s team this season and has contributed 17 goals. He will miss Saturday’s Premier League game against Norwich but, without a confirmed diagnosis and given Jota’s quick recovery from previous injuries, Liverpool are reluctant to rule the striker out of any other matches.
