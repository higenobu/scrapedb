4/20/2022,"Boris Johnson has spoken of his “humility” as he addressed MPs for the first time since receiving a fixed-penalty notice for breaching lockdown rules. The prime minister repeated the apology he gave for his conduct in the wake of last week’s fine, but urged MPs to focus instead on pressing issues including the conflict in Ukraine. Johnson said he had just been discussing Ukraine with world leaders including Joe Biden, but first wanted to address MPs “with all humility”. “I paid the fine immediately, and I offered the British public a full apology,” he said. “As soon as I received the notice, I acknowledged the hurt and the anger and I said that people had a right to expect better of their prime minister – and I repeat that again in the house now.” He added: “It did not occur to me then or subsequently that a gathering in the cabinet room, just before a vital meeting on Covid strategy could amount to a breach of the rules. That was my mistake and I apologise for it unreservedly.” Johnson said the “hurt and anger” prompted by his lockdown behaviour had given him “an even greater sense of obligation to deliver on the priorities of the British people, and to respond in the best traditions of our country to Putin’s barbaric onslaught on Ukraine.” Responding to Johnson’s statement, Keir Starmer said: “What a joke. Even now, as the latest mealy mouthed apology stumbles out of one side of his mouth, a new set of deflections and distortions pours from the other.” MPs will vote on Thursday on a Labour motion seeking to refer the prime minister to the House of Commons privileges committee over claims he lied to parliament about lockdown gatherings. Johnson reassured MPs in December that “all guidance was followed” in Downing Street during the pandemic – a statement apparently contradicted by the Metropolitan police’s decision to impose a fixed-penalty notice. According to the ministerial code, ministers who “knowingly mislead parliament” are expected to offer their resignation. Johnson will be on a trade visit to India when Thursday’s vote is held, as he seeks to demonstrate to colleagues that he is getting on with the job of running the country. The fixed-penalty notices received by Johnson and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, were levied in relation to a birthday gathering for Johnson on 19 June 2020. The prime minister and senior government officials could yet face further sanction in the coming weeks as the Met continues its investigations into lockdown gatherings. Johnson will address his own MPs later on Tuesday, amid fears among Tory backbenchers that public disgust at Partygate is damaging the party’s standing.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson apologises in Commons over Partygate fine,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/19/boris-johnson-apologises-in-commons-over-partygate-fine
4/20/2022,"My father, John Henderson, who has died aged 79, was an artist whose paintings concentrated on scenes familiar in the landscape of Cornwall, where he lived. Haystacks, tyres, cows in a field, the innumerable greens of hedgerows and their contrasting flowers, as well as quayside ropes and static caravans, all became subjects of years of close work. He exhibited widely in the 1970s and 80s with solo exhibitions at DM gallery in London and the Newlyn Orion gallery in Cornwall. His work was included in group shows at Espace, Amsterdam; Kunsthal, Rotterdam; OK Harris, New York; and the Whitechapel Gallery, London. He also participated in the Tolly Cobbold/Eastern Arts 2nd National Exhibition in Cambridge, and had work in shows at Fischer Fine Art, London; the Festival Interceltique de Lorient, Brittany, France; and Sheila Harrison Fine Art, London. John was born in Torbay, Devon, to Margery (nee Picton), a biology teacher, and Richard Henderson, an agricultural economist, who died when John was six years old. After attending Truro school, Cornwall, John went to Falmouth School of Art from 1960 to 1964, then Winchester School of Art to study painting before continuing his studies in Haarlem, the Netherlands, at Atelier 63 (now De Ateliers, an independent art programme), on a Dutch government scholarship (1966-68). It was in the Netherlands that he met our mother, Enid nee Pearl, a sculptor. They married in London in 1969 before settling in Cornwall, first living in Zennor and then Pendeen before moving to the village of Nancledra, Penzance, where they had three children: Hannah, Sonia and me. It was here that John drew his inspiration for his paintings. In 1989 Enid died of breast cancer. While the circumstances were incredibly tough, John did his best as a single parent to bring up his three young daughters and to continue painting. In the 90s he exhibited at the South West Open and had solo shows at Beaux Arts, Bath, Rainyday gallery, Penzance, and the Chelsea Arts Club, London. In the early 2000s, when his children had grown up, John spent several years living in the south-west of France before returning to St Just in Cornwall, where he lived until his death. A retrospective exhibition celebrating 50 years of his painting was held at the PZ gallery in Penzance in 2019. A quiet man with a brilliant sense of mischief and fun, John took huge pride in his children. He was happiest when exploring the countryside, was a voracious reader (including of the Guardian) and only ever wore double denim. He is survived by his daughters, his grandchildren, Samuel and Martha, and his brother, Bill.",Arts/Art and design,John Henderson obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/19/john-henderson-obituary
4/20/2022,"Jonathan Freedland does well to rubbish four of the main “spurious arguments” advanced by Tories for Boris Johnson to stay in office, but strangely fails to mention the one that is possibly the most damaging for the Tory party (Johnson to stay because of Ukraine? Nonsense. The war makes it more urgent that he go, 15 April). Many Tory MPs have openly acknowledged that there is no one in the party ready to take Johnson’s place, so the first prime minister ever found to have broken the law in office has to stay. What an admission. Presumably from this we can assume that no other Tory MP would be able to persuade voters that the party is committed “both to the observance of the law, and also to the rule of law”, in the words of Lord Wolfson? Furthermore, is there nobody with better, more humane ideas for dealing with asylum seekers, or ready to impose fair taxation policies after facing scrutiny of their own tax records? Even more importantly, does no one better than Johnson exist in the party with the necessary empathy to help the millions of people suffering in the cost-of-living crisis? If Labour can exploit these weaknesses by launching a full attack on the government’s appalling record and debunking the Tory propaganda about how efficiently Covid was dealt with, the May local elections results should at least force the men in grey suits into action.Bernie EvansLiverpool  There is another spurious argument to add to Jonathan Freedland’s analysis. It is the Tory mantra that whatever Boris Johnson’s faults, they should be forgiven because on Covid he “got all the big calls right”. No he did not. On PPE, stock was allowed to deteriorate and then he introduced a wasteful, inefficient and corrupt system for replacement contracts. On test and trace, he instituted an expensive privatised tracing system that could have been much better handled by existing local public health authorities. On lockdowns, he dithered and then was overeager to lift restrictions. On excess deaths, despite the early vaccine rollout (thanks to the NHS), our performance has been worse than comparable countries. All of which suggests that whatever the outcome of the official investigation, it is already clear that on Covid, Johnson did not get all the big calls right.Dr Colin J SmithWest Kirby, Wirral  Where is the attorney general, the senior government law officer, in all this? Nowhere to be seen. The person who occupies the role has an overriding obligation to ensure that the rule of law is paramount. No attorney can continue to be part of a government led by ministers found to have flagrantly violated this principle, accompanied by denials and lies – a position clearly understood by Lord Wolfson in his resignation speech as justice minister. Anything less is tantamount to complicity.Michael Mansfield QCLondon  We’ve received our postal ballots for the May council election and see that the Tory candidates appear as “local Conservatives”. All the literature mentions only local issues. This is the first time in our 50-plus years of voting that the local Tories have tried to separate themselves formally from the national party, so evidently Boris Johnson, partygate and inflation are cutting through as disadvantages.

Do you expect your baby’s father to be with you during ultrasound scans? Thank the NCT for that too; similarly, his presence on the postnatal ward. Interesting that many of these humane situations have so quickly been removed “due to Covid”. Did you have a “gentle caesarean” with the lights dimmed and voices quietened for the birth of the baby – again, thank the NCT. What about the cord? Was the cord allowed to finish pulsating so that the baby received its full quota of blood? Thank the NCT. Finally, why is there more research into childbirth than any other area of medicine?

4/20/2022,"Standing on the doorstep of his terrace house in Brunshaw, a few minutes’ walk from Burnley football club’s stadium, Turf Moor, Vic is perhaps not many people’s idea of a typical Green voter. For one thing, he was formerly a Conservative. There’s also the fact he’s 85. “They’re working hard all the time. It’s not just at elections you hear from them,” Vic says, having just promised his support to Alex Hall, who hopes to become the Greens’ second councillor in the ward on 5 May. “The other parties take you for granted.” Stories about Green successes have become something of a repeat event in recent local elections, and one of the near certainties of this year’s poll is that the party will end up with another record number of councillors – their current total of about 460 was a record, and they expect to make net gains. The Greens will field more than 2,500 candidates across England, Wales and Scotland, with the latter having a separate organisation and about 20 councillors. Such is the party’s ubiquity, officials say, that if they do not stand in a particular ward, voters email to complain. While the Greens hope for increases in traditional metropolitan hunting grounds such as London, Manchester and Birmingham, the battle in Burnley demonstrates how their appeal has expanded, in terms of geography and in the range of potential voters, a factor in traditional party loyalties breaking down. If everything goes well for them, the Greens could go from having had their first Burnley councillor in 2018, to five now and up to eight next month, potentially making them the second biggest party, albeit well behind a still-dominant Labour. Three Green councillors represent the central ward of Trinity, which has significant deprivation. But among targets this year are second seats in the more middle-class Brunshaw and in Worsthorne, an affluent rural village just outside the town. Nationally, more than half the Greens’ target seats this year are held by Conservatives, official say. On the Burnley campaign trail it becomes clear that promises of support are coming from people of a range of political backgrounds and, as illustrated by Vic, ages. Some of the appeal comes from core policy offerings such as opposing speculative homebuilding on greenfield sites without any promises of associated infrastructure. But a good deal of it is based on something much more prosaic: being very visible and knocking on lots of doors, activities the party argues have been neglected by Labour and Conservatives in their strongholds. “Maybe that is the difference between us and others – we’re seen around here, and they’re not,” says Scott Cunliffe, who was elected in the Cliviger with Worsthorne ward in 2021. A third of Burnley seats are contested each year, with county council elections in the fourth. Andy Fewings, who became the town’s first Green councillor in 2018 and is seeking re-election in May, talks of “complacency from the bigger parties, particularly Labour, as it’s always been seen as a Labour town.” He says: “What we’re offering is the sort of grassroots, out-and-about politics that Labour should be standing for, and perhaps has moved away from because they’re so used to winning in these kinds of areas. In part it’s just people responding to the fact it has been so long since they had a conversation with a politician on a doorstep.” With incumbency, however, comes pressure to deliver. Door-knocking in Brunshaw, Cunliffe and Hall are angrily buttonholed by a woman unloading her car who demands to know why her query to another Green councillor about insulation grants went unanswered, insisting she will never back the party again. A good 15 minutes of apologies and promises to look into the oversight leaves her seemingly mollified. “I think I talked her round,” says Cunliffe, who heads the Green group on the council. “She might even vote for us again.” Insulation grants are a relatively exotic subject to be raised. For the most part, residents want to discuss parking, bins and, during an earlier canvassing expedition in Worsthorne, anxieties about botched repairs to its sole remaining cobbled street. The village, one of whose three pubs has just had a costly renovation with upmarket food and prices to match – there is head-shaking talk of pints approaching £6 – would initially appear an unlikely spot for Green success. But knocking on doors, Jack Launer, who hopes to take one of the two remaining Conservative seats, manages to extract several pledges of votes, with at least three people agreeing to display posters. Several householders are indifferent, but no one is obviously hostile. Chris Williams, the head of elections for the Greens in England and Wales, says one factor is the general lack of trust in politics, exacerbated by reports about Downing Street parties, and a perception that his party is perhaps different. “There is an understanding that people don’t get involved in the Greens for some sort of political career. So voters can see the authenticity of what we’ve got to offer, and they like that,” he says. “We’ve got targeted campaigns going on in the majority of councils up for election this year. We couldn’t have said that even three years ago. It is quite a change. “A lot of our members can see that winning elections is very viable, whereas 10 years ago they might have focused more on internal policymaking. Now our members see there is a path.”",News/Politics,Greens get out and about in Burnley in push for more local election success,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/19/greens-get-out-and-about-in-burnley-in-push-for-more-local-election-success
4/20/2022,"Frank Lampard has said Everton cannot expect to benefit from Sean Dyche’s shock sacking because Burnley are adept at fighting for Premier League survival. Burnley’s decision on Friday to remove their long-serving manager has been portrayed in some quarters as a boost to Everton’s chances of avoiding relegation, given Dyche’s experience and the timing of his removal. Everton, who host Leicester on Wednesday, are three points above their relegation rivals with a game in hand and Lampard insists only his team, not events at Turf Moor, can determine the club’s Premier League status. “Firstly, Sean Dyche has been an incredible manager of the club with what he’s done in the time he was there; I think that has been the universal reaction to it,” the Everton manager said. “But the club have decided to make a change and Sean Dyche I’m sure deserves maybe a bit of a rest and will then get himself a fantastic job because of the level of manager he has shown himself to be. I wish Sean all the best. “In terms of what it means for Burnley going forward, nobody knows. You can go through history and see there have been good reactions to change and not so good reactions to changes. It doesn’t affect Everton. “I saw a quote this week saying we’ve been let off the hook because this happened. I don’t see how. It doesn’t change anything. Burnley are a good team and Burnley are used to fighting to stay in the Premier League. That fact will remain the same.”",Sport/Football,"Dyche sacking does not alter Everton’s chances of survival, Lampard claims",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/19/sean-dyche-sacking-burnley-will-not-affect-everton-survival-prospects-frank-lampard
4/20/2022,"Tory backbenchers have today renewed calls for the government to scrap the “green” policy costs they say add £153 a year to the average home’s annual gas and electricity bills. While it is a significant sum, it is a fraction of the overall cost which stands at just under £2,000 a year. Here’s how your bill is currently calculated. The wholesale market price of gas and electricity plays the biggest role in determining the average energy bill, and following the steady rise in wholesale prices since last August, it now accounts for just under 50% of bills – £1,077 of the average capped bill. Energy suppliers typically buy their gas and electricity from the market in advance, so Ofgem determines the cost of buying energy from the market by tracking wholesale prices over a period of six months ahead of the next price cap period. The price cap will be increased again in October, and unless wholesale prices fall substantially over the summer – something that looks very unlikely – average household bills are expected to rise to £2,600 a year. The next biggest cost is that of providing and running the infrastructure of supplying the UK’s homes and businesses via pylons, gas pipelines and all the associated costs. At £371 a year this now accounts for about 18% of the average household bill. Network costs also include the increasing price of having to bail out failed suppliers. Energy companies that take on customers after the collapse of a rival can claim “any reasonable additional, otherwise unrecoverable, costs” of taking on those customers – currently adding about £68 per household. While people opposed to this element of the bill have portrayed it as an unnecessary green tax, this is not entirely accurate. Policy costs account for £153 or 8% of the average household capped bill. While this does include the energy company obligation scheme, which pays to upgrade home insulation for households on low incomes, plus the renewables obligation that requires suppliers to source renewable electricity, it also pays for the warm homes discount which will pay vulnerable customers £150 a year next winter and will be opened up to a further 800,000 homes. Policy costs also cover the feed-in-tariff payments that were offered to those paying for solar panels to be installed on their roofs and contractually must be made. If policy costs were removed from bills, these payments would still have to be made in some form or other and would most likely have to come from general taxation. Ofgem figures show that policy costs have fallen from 12% to 8% of bills. Energy companies were allowed to claim operating costs of £204 from the average annual energy bill under the winter price cap, but that has grown by almost 10% to £220. The increase is in part because Ofgem’s allowance for supplier profits, which is set at 1.9%, is now included within operating costs rather than shown as a separate allowance. The winter price cap allowed energy suppliers to claim £23 from each default energy tariff as profit. Under the new cap they will make more than £37. VAT is set at 5% for energy bills, which equates to £98 a year for the average household – up from £61 before April – or more than £2.1bn in total. The Treasury windfall led to calls before the price cap announcement for the government to offer extra help to hard-pressed families by temporarily cutting VAT, but this has so far been resisted.",Lifestyle/Money,How are UK gas and electricity bills calculated?,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/19/how-are-uk-gas-and-electricity-bills-calculated
