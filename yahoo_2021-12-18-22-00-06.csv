12/18/2021,"Charlamagne tha God asked Vice President Kamala Harris Friday who the ""real president"" is. Harris quickly defended President Joe Biden and said ""don't start talking like a Republican."" Joe Manchin frustrated some Democrats again this week by holding up the Build Back Better Act. Vice President Kamala Harris gave a fiery response Friday when media host Charlamagne tha God asked her if President Joe Biden was the ""real president."" The tense exchange happened while Harris was being interviewed for Comedy Central's ""Tha God's Honest Truth."" ""So who's the real president of this country, is it Joe Manchin or Joe Biden?"" Charlamagne asked the vice president. ""Come on, Charlamagne,"" Harris responded, followed by Charlamagne chiming in to say ""I can't tell sometimes."" ""No, no, no, no. It's Joe Biden,"" Harris said. ""And don't start talking like a Republican about asking whether or not he's president."" ""It's Joe Biden. And I'm vice president and my name is Kamala Harris,"" she continued, before listing some of the Biden administration's accomplishments, including the child tax credit and plans to replace every lead water pipe in the country. ""I hear the frustration, but let's not deny the impact that we've had and agree also that there is a whole lot more work to be done,"" Harris said. Manchin, a Democratic senator from West Virginia, has frequently clashed this year with other members of his party, at times stalling Biden's domestic agenda. He has faced criticism for holding up bills that most of the party is in agreement on. Earlier this week, the moderate Democrat held up Biden's $2 trillion social- and climate- spending bill over concerns about the cost of the child tax credit, Insider's Joseph Zeballos-Roig reported. Biden said Thursday he was working closely with Manchin to come to an agreement and get the Build Back Better Act passed, which would require the support of every Democratic senator. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Friday the party should force Manchin's hand by bringing the bill to a vote, a position shared by Sen. Richard Durbin earlier this week.
