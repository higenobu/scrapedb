2/28/2022,"The flood broke through the levee before daybreak. By the time many residents of Lismore in northern New South Wales woke up on Monday, the water had begun to lap at their doorsteps. Those unable to flee climbed on to upper levels of their homes, then out on to their rooftops. Hundreds were rescued by boats and kayaks and jetskis; many others are still unaccounted for. Artist Lucy Vader began calling for help on her social media page at about 7am. A few hours later as she waited for rescuers, she posted a video of herself sitting on the roof as the flood continued to rise. “I’m on my roof, the water is still rising, my dog is stuck inside my house,” she said, the rain beating on to the tin roof.

The rain has been fierce and has continued, unabated. In some parts of the city, more than 1.5 metres of rain – close to the average annual rainfall – has come down since Thursday. Eight people have died, all in Queensland, while police hold grave fears for at least three more who are missing. On Sunday afternoon a 59-year-old man was killed while attempting to cross a flooded road on foot at Taigum, in Brisbane’s outer north. Police said witnesses had attempted to give the man CPR but he died at the scene. A man believed to be in his 50s is also presumed dead after his car was washed away in flood waters in the Currumbin Valley, near the NSW border, early on Monday. Police said they believe the man’s vehicle was driven about 30 metres along a flooded road. The vehicle has not been found. Having dumped on Brisbane, causing widespread flooding that authorities estimate may have caused damage to about 15,000 properties, the weather system finally moved south early on Sunday, giving the Queensland capital a chance to take stock of the damage. As the rainfall shifted, so did the flood threat. Northern NSW river towns of Murwillumbah and Lismore are both under water. Lismore is a community that has become used to flooding. The last time the levee broke, in 2017, was during ex-tropical cyclone Debbie. Locals in Lismore still talk about the 1954 flood. The rain started the same day a young Queen Elizabeth visited the town in northern NSW and the Wilsons River eventually peaked at 12.15 metres – a height that had not been exceeded in almost 70 years. On Monday, the same river peaked more than 2 metres higher than ever before – at 14.46 metres – and is predicted to reach 16 metres on Monday night. Videos show the town’s two-storey shopfronts inundated to their roofs. This is Keen St in #Lismore. The Wilson River is expected to peak at 14.4m this afternoon - more than TWO metres higher than 1974 peak (12.15 m) and February 1954 (12.27m) @nbnnews @9NewsSyd pic.twitter.com/krAxZE5rYI Northern rivers local John Vanderstok, who joined a flotilla of private boats rescuing residents trapped in flooded homes across the town today, said authorities had been overwhelmed by the scale of the rescue operation. “The emergency services are around but I’d say the locals outnumber them 20 to one, anyone who has a boat is just out there trying to save anyone they can. It’s just so sad, so terrible for the people trapped,” Vanderstok said. “There would have been – hanging out windows, on roofs – hundreds. There are people everywhere and there are also a lot of boats. I reckon about 200 to 300 boats are there – even heading back, I passed another 15 boats heading in.” Heavy rain in Brisbane finally eased about midnight on Monday, removing some of the strain that had choked suburban floodways and dumped record volumes into dams. Within hours of the rain stopping, suburban flooding caused by swollen creeks and Brisbane River tributaries largely subsided, and people were able to return to their homes to assess the damage. “We left about 3pm yesterday, the water was up to here,” said Nirin Giri, pointing to a spot just below the front balcony of his home at Newmarket, in Brisbane’s inner north. The surrounding houses on Ashgrove Avenue, near the bridge over Enoggera Creek, all suffered significant damage. The water overturned a large garden shed in a neighbour’s yard. “There’s mud right through [the house], you can see it has come right up along the wall there,” Giri said. “We are not alone, this has happened to everybody.” At the same time as people in Brisbane’s suburbs were returning to their homes, the Brisbane River reached its peak, causing inundation of low-lying banks, including parts of the CBD, Southbank and West End. Extremely high tides are expected to continue, but abate gradually, for the rest of the week. While heavy rainfall has finally eased, concern remains about storms forecast for later in the week which might cause further chaos if river levels are still high. Diana Eadie from the Bureau of Meteorology said those storms posed an additional risk. “That really intense rain is now shifting into north-east New South Wales and is easing for much of south-east Queensland,” she said. “That being said, the risk for significant flooding is still very real. “We’re expecting more settled conditions today and continuing into tomorrow. From Wednesday onwards and the following five days, we see a return of the potential for severe thunderstorm activity with the risk of damaging winds, large hail and locally heavy falls. “We’re not expecting widespread rain as we have seen in this event, but with any severe thunderstorm, there is the potential that we could see very intense rainfall rates in some localised areas.” The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said there had been “a huge response effort”. “It has been fast and it has been furious and it has had a big impact,” she said. “I don’t know about everyone else, but last night it was like cyclonic conditions outside. The winds, the rain and … we had two systems of thunderstorms merging last night as well during the course of the day. We didn’t know that was going to happen.”",News/Environment,Eastern Australian states hit by major flooding after ‘rain bomb’ weather event,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/28/eastern-australian-states-hit-by-major-flooding-after-rain-bomb-weather-event
2/28/2022,"Russia’s central bank has more than doubled interest rates to 20%, and banned foreigners from selling local securities, in a bid to protect its currency and economy in the face of international sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine. The rate rise, from 9.5%, is aimed to balance the precipitous fall in value of the rouble and surging inflation as the country braces for its financial markets to take battering this week. Currency trading will start later on Monday morning, but other markets have been delayed from opening until at least 3pm. The rouble fell 30% to a record low against the dollar before the intervention, and was down 25% after the move by the central bank. “External conditions for the Russian economy have drastically changed,” the central bank said in a statement, adding that the rate hike “will ensure a rise in deposit rates to levels needed to compensate for the increased depreciation and inflation risk”. The central bank has ordered companies to sell 80% of their foreign currency revenues. Elvira Nabiullina, the governor of Russia’s central bank, is due to speak on Monday afternoon detailing further measures. The central bank said the measures would “depend on the evaluation of risks from external and internal factors and financial markets’ reaction to them”. Other steps announced over the weekend include an assurance from the central bank that it would resume buying gold on the domestic market. Neil Shearing, the group chief economist at Capital Economics, said: “The central bank of Russia has this morning raised interest rates to 20% but other measures (eg limits on deposit withdrawals) are possible later today. All of this will accelerate Russia’s economic downturn – a fall in GDP of 5% now looks likely. Subsidiaries of some Russian banks overseas are likely to come under intense pressure (and may fail), but we judge that these are probably too small to create systemic risks.” Over the weekend, Vladimir Putin put his nuclear forces on high alert, while on Monday the commander of the Ukrainian forces said Russian troops had been stopped from taking over the capital, Kyiv.

2/28/2022,"Few artists have ever had the audacity to create a national music genre from scratch. This is what the Barbadian singer Jackie “Manface” Opel set out to do in 1968 – and more or less what he did. Born Dalton Bishop in 1938, Opel escaped a poverty-stricken background in Bridgetown to become celebrated as the greatest singer Barbados had ever produced to that point: a multi-talented entertainer with a multi-octave voice, who sang soul, calypso, gospel, R&B and ska, performed handstands on stage, doubled on sax and wrote hit songs on demand. Talent-spotted by the Jamaican bandleader Byron Lee, Opel spent most of the 1960s in Jamaica, where he sang with the Skatalites and became a Studio One regular. Bunny Wailer called Opel “the greatest of them all”; Bob Marley cited him as the reason he wanted to sing; others remembered him as the closest thing the Caribbean had to James Brown. On returning to Barbados in 1968, Opel felt that his homeland had some catching up to do. Jamaica had ska and rocksteady; Trinidad had calypso and soca; Barbados – which had only achieved independence from Britain in 1966 – needed a sound to call its own. He joined forces with the Troubadours, the house band of the Clyde B Jones funeral parlour, and together with the drummer Ken Jones came up with a rhythm he called “spouge”: a joyfully relentless, funky, syncopated beat that sits in a zone somewhere between vintage soca, inside-out ska and classic blue-collar soul. The single that resulted from those sessions, You Got to Pay, became one of the biggest hits that Barbados had ever produced. Within a few years, the cowbell-heavy spouge rhythm was all over the eastern Caribbean. “It was the thing to party to at weekends,” says the Barbadian musician and historian Stefan Walcott. “It was what people wanted to hear, not just in Barbados but in St Lucia, St Vincent, Dominica …” Opel’s protege, Richard Stoute, scored British airplay with his frenetic, horn-laden spouge cover of Vehicle by US rockers the Ides of March and toured the US as part of an annual Caribbean music showcase. Apparently, Madison Square Garden in New York went wild for spouge in the early 70s. “Every time I performed spouge, I was a big hit,” Stoute recalls. “People loved the rhythm! I’ve never seen spouge played without people getting up and moving.” Which makes it all the stranger that some time around 1975, spouge disappeared, almost without trace. In an age where everything has a digital footprint, spouge is very much word of mouth. You Got to Pay, the seminal recording, is not on Spotify, Apple or Amazon, while only a handful of Opel’s reputed 700 song-catalogue is available. Few people outside Barbados have heard of him and even on the island, his legacy is far from secure. At the celebrations to mark Barbados’s new status as a republic last November, spouge barely featured. The island’s annual Crop Over festival has Trinidadian soca and Jamaican dancehall, but no spouge. For the few surviving spouge artists, this is all rather sad. “The music is dead,” sighs Stoute, now 76. “It all got swept under the carpet. I don’t know what it would take to bring it back.” Most Barbadians I speak to express a mixture of wounded pride and bewilderment at the way spouge evaporated. “It was a genuinely indigenous form – but it’s seen as a failure,” says Walcott. “People say we didn’t have the confidence to push it, like Jamaica pushed ska. Every November, around the anniversary of independence, we have these same conversations about how great Jackie was, how hard he tried – and how we let him down.” The obscurity might be understandable if spouge wasn’t any good. But spouge is amazing. I defy anyone with a weakness for Studio One reggae, New Orleans funk or vintage calypso to listen to Bajan Spouge Music Mix Vol 1 on YouTube and remain stationary. It’s a riot of horns and cowbells, exuberance and attitude, and yet there is no Vol 2, and most of the songs in the mix are near-impossible to identify unless you happen to know a Bajan retiree with a long memory. Shazam draws a blank on two-thirds of them. Why is this music not better known? One explanation is that Opel died in a car crash in 1970, before he could secure its legacy: aged 32, he had only actually made two spouge recordings, You Got to Pay and You’re No Good (which he also, confusingly, recorded in a ska style). The spouge scene that blossomed in the early 70s was instead largely due to the efforts of vocal duo Draytons Two, who built on the rhythms created in that room next to the funeral home. To their singer Desmond Weekes, You Got to Pay was the sound of his island’s history. “When I heard that cowbell, it made me think of the slaves crossing from Africa,” he has said. “To prevent the slaves running away, they used to place the cowbell around their necks. I thought: this is connected to us, to Barbados.” The Draytons Two album Raw Spouge (1973), which featured originals alongside spouge covers of songs such as Toots and the Maytals’ 6 and 7 Books of Moses, helped to cement what would become the spouge groove. The cowbell and bass drum emphasise every first and fourth semi-quaver; the guitar and/or keyboard play an overlapping “a-chikkin” rhythm over the top; the bassline is free to do as it pleases, which means that spouge can be taken in different directions. The Blue Rhythm Combo sped things up, under the influence of New Orleans funk; the multi-racial harmony group the Sandpebbles sang softer, more calypso-inflected spouge; Opel’s old neighbour, Young Cassius Clay, developed a raucous style he called Dragon Spouge. And there were many more: the Escorts, Wendy Alleyne, and (my personal favourite) Lord Radio and the Bimshire Boys. So many great records, presumably warping somewhere under the Caribbean sun. Stoute maintains that the Barbadian establishment has never given the music the push it deserves, owing to entrenched class divisions. “I think it’s because Jackie Opel was a very poor man from a very poor background,” he says. “In Barbados, if you don’t have political involvement or the right parents, people seem to think that you have no value.” As a boy, Opel earned a living as a “wharf boy”, diving for pennies that tourists threw off the harbour. Without connections, he found it hard to break into the lucrative hotel performing circuit. Even when he returned to Barbados after his success in Jamaica (with a new set of dreadlocks) he was viewed with suspicion and condescension. By contrast, Stoute remembers Opel being mobbed when they toured Antigua. “The kind of appreciation he got from the Antiguan people was so overwhelming I couldn’t believe it. He never got that kind of attention in Barbados.” Walcott cites a number of other factors for the sound’s disappearance. Spouge didn’t receive much support from local radio (the then-dominant DJ, Vic Fernandes, scorned the style) while influential performers such as the calypsonian Mighty Sparrow dismissed it as a subgenre of calypso. Then there was the sheer expense of recording. As disco and funk grew in popularity in the late 70s, it was uneconomical to hire a horn section to play music that might be on the way out. But the cultural historian Curwen Best has argued that spouge declined largely for non-musical reasons. It was the sound of a brief moment of postcolonial optimism and pride – but once that moment passed, and Barbadian society remained largely unchanged, so did the music. Spouge lacked the “ideological base” that Jamaican artists such as Burning Spear and Marley had created for reggae. And Barbados is, after all, a small country of 280,000 people. What would it take to revive spouge? Stoute, who is reissuing all of his spouge recordings, feels that nothing less than erecting a statue of Jackie Opel where Horatio Nelson once stood in the centre of Bridgetown would do. “If we want to show what kind of a republic we are, we should be giving the Barbadian people the kind of appreciation that they deserve,” he says. “Let me tell this to you: the only thing we have to call our own is spouge. Everything else is carbon copy. There’s no one else who has created something that’s original for us.” In the meantime, a properly remastered Jackie Opel best of collection, and a decent compilation of vintage spouge classics, would be a start. Walcott says we shouldn’t hold our breath. “The ska guys can identify a global community. With spouge, people say: ‘Why are we bothering? Can it really earn money?’ So that’s where we are now.” But it needn’t stay that way. The wildly funky sound of spouge is long overdue a revival.

2/28/2022,"There are few clubs in the premier league with mood swings as dramatic as Tottenham’s right now. A week ago they joyously outplayed leaders Manchester City, then a 1-0 loss to 18th-placed Burnley prompted a seething Antonio Conte to openly question his own future. Now, after battering a broken Leeds 4-0 at Elland Road, the good vibes are back. Son Heung-min and Harry Kane are now firmly in the record books as the most prolific pairing of all time, creating 37 goals together and counting. Kane has returned to seriously good form. Dejan Kulusevski has settled in at warp speed. Conte’s frustrations may well surface again soon, but a turbulent week at least ended on a positive note. Tumaini Carayol Match report: Leeds 0-4 Tottenham Marcelo Bielsa has never stayed at a club as long as the thoroughly transformative three and a half years he spent at Leeds and that Elland Road tenure, which ended in his sacking on Sunday, will never be forgotten in West Yorkshire. It is hard to overstate Bielsa’s impact on Leeds but even he struggled when the spine of his side was removed by the injuries that have sidelined Patrick Bamford, Kalvin Phillips and Liam Cooper for much of this season. If the incoming manager, Jesse Marsch is to avoid relegation he needs that trio restored to fitness on schedule this spring, not to mention devise a way of modifying the aggressive high-pressing style that terrified opponents last season. Harry Kane and his Tottenham teammates triumphed far too easily on Saturday, their 4-0 win prefacing one of English football’s saddest exits. Louise Taylor Bielsa transformed Leeds with decency, humility and hard work Anthony Martial is on loan at Sevilla, Mason Greenwood is unavailable, and Edinson Cavani is injured (again). Thus Ralf Rangnick has to continue selecting Cristiano Ronaldo, who is 37 and appears shot of confidence as was illustrated by the slew of chances he missed as Manchester United somehow failed to beat an insipid, relegation-threatened Watford. Asked about Ronaldo’s workload, the interim-manager said: “Edinson is not available [and] we don’t have that many other central strikers. For the last 15-20 minutes I brought on Marcus [Rashford] and Jadon [Sancho] – almost all our offensive players were on the pitch. I spoke with him [Ronaldo] yesterday before the game, before the training session: he told me that he was fully fit and that’s why I had him in the starting XI.” Perhaps it is time to field Rashford as the No 9. The 24-year-old has previously operated there and as he too is low on form, the chance to lead the line might offer the fillip he needs. Jamie Jackson Match report: Manchester United 0-0 Watford How much trouble are Brentford in? Defeat to Newcastle on Saturday could to an extent be written off as a result of the dismissal of Josh DasSilva after 11 minutes that, as Thomas Frank said, was probably the correct decision but was also essentially a random event, the midfielder catching Matt Targett as he stepped over the ball to protect possession: an act of carelessness rather than malice. But this fits a pattern. Brentford have lost nine of their last 11 in the league and, perhaps most worryingly, have scored only six goals in that time. Although the return of Christian Eriksen 259 days after his cardiac arrest understandably took the headlines, in terms of Brentford’s hopes of survival the more significant comeback may have been that of Ivan Toney. Eriksen should also offer additional creativity, but without Toney they have looked toothless. Jonathan Wilson Match report: Brentford 0-2 Newcastle Phil Foden’s winner came from a left-wing cross by Bernardo Silva. City’s most sustained spell of pressure, however, came when the Portuguese was stationed on the opposite flank. He had begun as the false nine and while Pep Guardiola reorganised his forward line midway through the first half, a second change of tack helped shift momentum after Allan and co had stifled Kevin De Bruyne before the break. “To break this kind of defence is always so complicated and difficult,” Guardiola said. He showed his prowess at tactical chess. John Stones was an ersatz right-back but, in possession, Guardiola instructed him to come infield and act as a midfielder, in turn allowing De Bruyne to operate outside him and combine with Silva on the wing. Guardiola added: “On the right side Bernardo and Kevin were brilliant and [Jordan] Pickford was the best player in the second half.” He needed to be. Richard Jolly  Match report: Everton 0-1 Manchester City After consecutive defeats to bottom-half teams, Aston Villa appeared to set themselves on the right path as they recovered to produce a vital 2-0 win at Brighton. The victory included a partlicularly hopeful sight for Steven Gerrard: Ollie Watkins slipping past the Brighton defence to calmly score his first goal in seven league games. Perspective was provided by Cash, who scored the first goal and then removed his shirt to reveal a message of support towards his Poland teammate Tomasz Kedziora, the Dynamo Kyiv defender. Earlier in the day, Cash and his international teammates each posted a statement firmly explaining their decision not to play against the Russian national team after the invasion of Ukraine. Tumaini Carayol Match report: Brighton 0-2 Aston Villa With various teams directly above them struggling badly, Burnley aided their survival hopes by pulling off a hard-fought 1-1 draw against Crystal Palace. It was predictably grisly: Burnley registered just one shot on target, 16 fouls to Palace’s five, and scored through an own-goal by the Palace captain, Luka Milivojevic, from an Aaron Lennon cross. But what mattered was the result and the growing hope that comes with it. With their point, Burnley have the joint-highest number of draws in the league, 12, and the fewest wins atthree. But they are one pointbehind Everton in 17th and with a far better goal difference than anyone in that fight. If grinding out results like Saturday’s ultimately result in survival, they will take it. Tumaini Carayol Match report: Crystal Palace 1-1 Burnley There are plenty of people who will regret, once upon a time, levelling a “dinosaur” tag at David Moyes. It was offensive and unfair, and some of the football West Ham are now capable of gives the lie to it perfectly well. He is still seeking to evolve their style and, as their matchwinner Tomas Soucek had suggested in midweek, has tweaked a few things he feels will help their top-four pursuit. “Sometimes you have to break things to make them better,” Moyes said after the important victory over Wolves. “You have to change things up and see if you can find something else and I am in that mood at the moment. It’s two years since we beat Southampton to get out of the bottom three and we have had a pretty good rise in those two years; now it’s what are the next two years going to be?” The next phase of Moyes’ West Ham era could further silence those who got him so badly wrong. Nick Ames  Match report: West Ham 1-0 Wolves Pep Guardiola’s half-time adjustments may ultimately have helped City towards three points but the fact that he was forced into such a rethink reflects well on his opposite number. Frank Lampard’s credentials as a tactician have been subject to serious doubt over the course of his short coaching career but he set his Everton side up smartly on Saturday and, for the opening stages of the game, kept the country’s most decorated attacking side at bay with ease. This was doubly impressive as it required an overhaul of formation – from 3-4-3 to 4-3-3 – which Lampard’s side enacted seamlessly. Particularly eye-catching were the central midfield duo of Abdoulaye Doucouré and Donny van de Beek, who together offer a rare combination of steel and style. The Dutchman is only on loan until the end of the season but should he rediscover his form, as he has hinted at doing under Lampard, a permanent move to Merseyside should surely suit all parties. Alex Hess As the grounds staff at St Mary’s set to work within seconds of the final whistle, Ralph Hasenhüttl made a point of drinking in another home win, this time over Norwich, with supporters. The way the Saints are playing, with such control and freedom, it is hard not to wonder whether a team that started December four points above the relegation zone could push for the European places, particularly given the relatively kind March schedule. They face Newcastle, Watford and Burnley in three of their next four league matches but first host West Ham on Wednesday for a place in the FA Cup quarter-finals. Stuart Pearce, who took in Friday’s game from the stands, will have no doubt relayed to David Moyes the apparent feel-good factor on the south coast. “The belief is there that we are strong enough to switch to the next gear to kill these games,” Hasenhüttl said.

2/28/2022,"When Alessandro Sciarroni discovered an Italian folk dance called polka chinata, it was at that point a near-forgotten art practised by only five men in the world. By contrast, when he first watched the 1,000-year-old, thigh-slapping Bavarian/Tyrolean Schuhplattler, it was still being taught and performed, known for its lederhosen, beer steins and a dark period in its history as a favourite of the Nazis. Both of these dances, though, are ones the artist and choreographer has turned into something new, which he’ll be bringing to the inaugural Dance Reflections festival, accelerating the return of international dance to London, post-Covid. Folk dance is not Sciarroni’s only influence – his background is in experimental theatre – but it’s fertile ground for contemporary artists (another upcoming show, by Jamal Gerald at Leeds’s Transform festival, reinvents the Jumbie dance from Montserrat as a dance of black queer joy). Sciarroni has an anthropological eye. As a young boy growing up on Italy’s east coast, he was fascinated by animal behaviour, the flocking of birds, the way insects worked in unison. “I was hypnotised and very curious,” he says. “When you are a child you see these things and ask these huge philosophical questions.” Watching these centuries-old folk dances, those big “whys” returned: “Why do they do it? How do they know what to do? It’s something that reconnects me with the mysteries of the universe.” When you step back and look at it, much of human behaviour seems bizarre, especially on the dancefloor. “You see a group of people using a lot of energy to do something that looks pointless,” says Sciarroni. “But the more you look, the more you recognise something about yourself in them.” That tension between tradition and modernity is always at play. “Sometimes tradition is a nest where you can feel protected,” he says, “but it can also be a cage.” Sciarroni extracts the dances from their original music but has no desire to wipe out tradition – he teaches polka chinata workshops alongside performances of his piece Save the Last Dance for Me. Polka chinata is performed by two men in close embrace (a bit like a tango) who spin in tight circles, bending their knees until they’re almost sitting on the ground. It began around Bologna in the early 1900s, a way for men to show off to women, and after the second world war became almost a competitive activity. Then it disappeared, until one dance scholar, Giancarlo Stagni, discovered some old recordings. Sciarroni went to Stagni’s village every week for six months to learn the steps. “It’s very difficult,” he says. “And it’s very beautiful, because when you hug your partner and crouch down, it’s really a dance about trust and sharing the weight of the body. At the beginning you approach it technically, but then it becomes about feelings.” He means for the dancers, but hopefully the same is true for the audience. The Schuhplattler is another dance designed for men to show off to women – apparently there was once a rule that you should stop dancing once you were married. The energetic stamping and shoe-slapping has endured the rise and fall of empires as well as being admired by Hitler (he namechecked the dance in conversations recorded in the 40s, but there’s no political ideology inherent in the steps). Sciarroni suggests that this strange ritual will carry on as long as there’s one person to dance it and another to watch, so that was his original concept: the dancers would keep dancing until no one was left in the audience or on the stage. In reality, the audience never walked out, and while there’s a nod to the kind of endurance art practised by Marina Abramović et al in the 70s, this would not be a dance to the death in a “They Shoot Horses, Don’t They?” way, but an exercise in living in the present. The dancers slap and leap until the joy of being in the moment or the connection with the audience wanes, at which point they leave the stage. In the original version, that could be one hour or it could be three. This new edition, called The Collection and danced by Lyon Opera Ballet, runs at around 80 minutes, but within that, the piece changes every time. The dancers are soon soaked with sweat, and you can watch the balance of energy and effort changing. “You see the dancers smiling,” says Sciarroni. “If you smile, you release – and receive – a lot of energy. Then that effort is translated into pleasure. You may see tradition fighting the present to survive, but you can also see a group of people trying to do something to support each other.” When one person’s energy wanes, they can bring down the rest of the group. “You have to leave,” says Sciarroni, “so that you allow the group to survive.” The Collection is at the Royal Opera House Linbury Studio, London, 19 and 20 March,; Save the Last Dance for Me is on 20 March, Royal Opera House.",Arts/Stage,"Well, slap my shoe!

2/28/2022,"If you were to poll a few hundred people, I wonder what they could tell you about the Operation Trojan Horse conspiracy story of 2014. I wonder how many would know one basic fact: that the furore originated from a single letter that was found, early on, to be bogus. I fear that it would be a pitiful number. I’m also pretty certain that even if you told those people that the main allegation – that there was an organised plot to take over schools in the UK and run them to strict Islamic principles – was debunked, they would still think: well, there’s no smoke without fire. Maybe the smoke didn’t come from this particular fire, but there is definitely another one elsewhere. A recent podcast from the New York Times, The Trojan Horse Affair, illuminated how this works. The podcast spent years following the Trojan horse plot and revealed that the government’s response to the letter – which included the suspensions of scores of teachers, an inquiry and changes to education and counter-terror policy – happened after the then education secretary, Michael Gove, who spearheaded the Trojan horse response, had apparently been warned that the letter was fake, a letter that he went on to quote from and cite as evidence of a grave threat to Britain’s schools. The podcast has itself became a second act in the Trojan horse scandal, because its findings are still resolutely denied by the main players implicated, from Michael Gove to the media establishments that played their part. None has been moved to humility. Instead they point to different smoke, more fires, other concerns that were raised by whistleblowers about worrying practices in some schools. For those who have tried to counter misinformation about Muslims, this is a familiar disappointment – to take on wild untruths and then realise that even when they are exposed and even partially corrected, little changes. The podcast is essentially about a state and media captured by prejudice, either unconsciously or knowingly, but it is tangentially about many other things. Each of these is a strand that, when joined with others, tells a story about a country in which the truth can be so easily buried through the fumblings and machinations of a whole cast of protagonists. Some are well meaning, but among them are credulous bureaucrats, jobsworth civil servants, motivated ideologues and a few useful idiots. In short, it is about structural racism – a bland, blame-diffusing term that comes to life during the podcast. Listening to The Trojan Horse Affair, I went from thinking not how was this allowed to happen, but how was it ever not going to happen? The only way to describe the feeling is to say that it is the opposite of gaslighting – ungaslighting, if you will. But despite the podcast’s huge popularity, it will still make little difference where it counts. Because other fires will be pointed to, and in their glare the inconvenient truths – or untruths – exposed by the podcast can be bleached out. This highlights the fact that it is virtually impossible to go about setting the record straight when it comes to false stories about Muslims without running into the charge that in that process one is minimising real stories about Muslims. Perhaps, some say, there was no Trojan horse plot, but there were findings and whistleblower reports of casual homophobia, the teaching of creationism, and students being told that women could not refuse to have sex with their husbands. Doesn’t that justify everything? Well, no. What we have are two completely different categorisations of events. One is a plot to take over schools, a deeply sinister trope that paints a community as a threat, seeps into legislation and has profound ramifications on social cohesion. The other – incidents of malpractice within schools – is a problem that should be specifically and forensically addressed, but should not be weaponised to feed into fears about Muslims as a whole. And it should go without saying that the state should not be involved in that conflation, justifying the muddying of those categories for its own ends. It should be a reliable, impartial arbiter. The response to the Trojan horse letter was a disaster on several levels. It failed both whistleblowers with ostensibly legitimate concerns by not treating their complaints in a responsible, targeted manner, and British Muslims as a whole, who have to live – even now – with the stain and notoriety of an apparent “Muslim plot” to take over schools that has now passed into lore. Raising concerns about your own Muslim community is a traumatising and difficult task; doing it in an atmosphere of Islamophobia makes it doubly fraught, because amid that toxicity, two impulses compete – the wish to prove Muslims are up to no good, and the equal and opposite desire to defend Muslims comprehensively because they are always assumed by critics to be up to no good. The latter is an impulse to which I constantly have to be alert: the fear that admitting some allegations might be true effectively means conceding – in the eyes of a hostile world – to all the false ones as well. How is anyone expected to bring their fragility and their concerns to the public sphere when it is interested in only one thing: how to use these accounts to advance an anti-Muslim agenda? The events once again under review are historical, but it’s a mistake to believe they are behind us, for the atmosphere in which the Trojan horse conspiracy thrived and flourished, is much the same today. Our society is, if anything, even more receptive to disinformation about the villainy of Muslims. Since the Trojan horse story, there have been others about “no-go areas”, where those not of the faith dare not tread, and of sinister, proselytising Muslims adopting and Islamicising Christian children. These lies stick, and they work, and they mean that concerns about Muslims behaving badly in schools will always be seen as an issue far graver than the dangerous irresponsibility of government officials making politically divisive hay with a fake letter. That is the potency of Islamophobia, where the Muslim is always perceived as the most powerful, most coordinated threat. But in this case, in any fair analysis, surely the most malevolent force was a government that lied, mainstreamed a conspiracy theory that it knew to be false, based legislation on it, and probably ensured that a raft of problems that needed genuine attention didn’t get it. That is where there is both smoke and fire. If you cannot see that, it is because the fire is not burning you.

2/28/2022,"In Lismore, north-eastern NSW, a house was pictured almost entirely submerged by murky flood water. In the photograph posted to Instagram by a local cafe on Monday afternoon, only a pitched tin roof and treetops are visible above the waterline. Images like this one have documented from the ground the destruction of unprecedented flood water as the regional city was hit overnight. Across Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, pictures of boats transporting people through residential streets, pets curled up on high kitchen counters, and of families holding each other in distress in front of homes under water, have told a story of an unfolding disaster. This article includes content provided by Instagram. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'. Early on Monday morning, the NSW State Emergency Service sent out urgent evacuation orders to the Lismore levee due to “dangerous and rapid river level rises” in the region. The Bureau of Meteorology expected flood waters in Wilsons River to peak at 14.40m on Monday afternoon – surpassing the 12.27m of Lismore’s February 1954 floods. As of 2:52pm today, Wilsons River at Lismore was at 14.37m. The BoM advised “further rises are possible”. While the SES was reportedly inundated by more than 1,000 calls, stranded locals in Lismore were desperately reaching out for help via social media. Sue Higginson tweeted: “This is catastrophic … Lismore needs back up. People are on and in their roof, some are screaming for their lives and water is still rising. Friends are rescuing friends.” In a thread from 9:48am on Monday, Sam Connor had been tweeting out the addresses and calls for help of people stranded in flood waters. “188 Casino St, they are inside the roof. 2 children who can’t swim, an elderly couple (one with disability which stops her from using her muscles) and a 28 yr old woman, please please help,” one Tweet read. “13 Rhodes Street South Lismore, elderly lady stuck by herself, very scared for her life, can’t climb onto the roof. 4th house [on] the right please help,” read another. And the list went on. Countless grandparents, people alone with their pets, families with disabled children – all either stuck on roofs to avoid water rising above waist level, or unable to get to the safety of a roof at all. The calls came from locals stuck themselves, or concerned relatives and friends. Most were preceded with an address and punctured with an “urgent!” or “please help”. “162 union street, my father is trying to stay afloat with a broken back and is near exhausted to keep himself up. He is stuck in my room the door is jammed, windows broken, please help him.” “Goodbye house,” said another Twitter user, Eddie Lloyd, who was rescued to higher land after her home was pummelled with water that has surpassed roof level. North of Lismore, on a farm in Murwillumbah, Twitter user Kerrie Davies shared an image of a goat standing atop a small hut overlooking a flooded field. “Worried about the livestock and animals … who are trying to survive,” she tweeted. And in Chinderah, a town in the Tweed Shire just one hour drive north of Lismore, Kelly and Mick Hobbins sat on the couch on their porch, waiting. Flood waters were lapping, almost literally, at their doorstep. “What else can you do?” said Mick, when interviewed by Guardian Australia. The couple has lived in Chinderah for 17 years. The area, on the southern banks of the Tweed River near Kingscliff, is known as flood prone, but this was only the second time their house has been at risk. In 2017, water came through and forced them to relocate for 11 months. “They said it was a one-in-100-year flood, not every five years,” Mick said. An evacuation order for Chinderah and nearby Fingal Head is current for the next 36 hours, and locals are waiting to see what Tuesday morning’s high tide brings. Len was clutching his thongs under his fluro yellow rain jacket, having just waded through thigh-deep water to check out the Chinderah flood post and see how things compare. “It’s about one thong length lower than 2017 at the moment,” he said. A few doors down, Christine McDonald and her neighbour Mark Curran stood in a frontyard lagoon. It had flooded Mark’s downstairs, where the washing machine and dryer were up on a table. His thoughts were with neighbours around the corner who brought their newborn baby home last night, only to be forced to evacuate in the early hours. At Smiley Tots childcare centre, the backyard playground would normally be home to raucous games by mid-morning on a Monday. Instead, a football floated aimlessly in the flood waters as they hoped to avoid a repeat of 2017, which saw the entire playground needing replacing. “It’s just rainwater there at the moment,” said part owner Greg Best. “So long as that horrible brown flood water doesn’t come through, I think we’ll be all right.” His wife, Erin, is originally from Lismore and has been checking in with friends and family there. “My girlfriend’s dad is standing on a ladder in his kitchen waiting to get rescued,” she said. “He’s 70 years old and can’t swim. “We’re lucky we haven’t got anything like that.”",News/Australia news,Messaging from rooftops: Lismore’s flooded residents document a disaster,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/28/messaging-from-rooftops-lismores-flooded-residents-document-a-disaster
2/28/2022,"A police officer charged with murdering an Aboriginal man, repeatedly acted against his training on the day of the incident, a court has heard. The court had previously heard constable Zachary Rolfe shot Kumanjayi Walker three times while trying to arrest him on 9 November 2019 in the remote community of Yuendumu, about 300km from Alice Springs. Rolfe is charged in relation to the second and third shots fired at Walker, a 19-year-old Warlpiri man. Rolfe has pleaded not guilty and is defending his actions on the basis they were justified in light of the risk that Walker, who had stabbed Rolfe with scissors immediately before the shooting, posed to him and a colleague. Det Sr Sgt Andrew Barram, who has been a Northern Territory police officer for 25 years and conducted multiple reviews of the shooting, told the NT supreme court on Monday that he believed Rolfe had acted contrary to multiple aspects of his training. The court heard that, until recently, Barram had oversight of all firearms and defensive tactics training within NT police, and reviewed and wrote the force’s training manuals. He gave evidence that body-worn camera footage of Rolfe and another officer attending a different Yuendumu property known as House 577 shortly before the shooting, showed Rolfe had unclipped two firearm retention devices on his holster. Barram told the court this was inconsistent with NT police training, as officers are only supposed to remove these devices when they plan to draw their weapon, and there was no indication that was necessary. “He’d been told there was no one there other than a boy that looks about 10 years old,” Barram told the court. “I don’t think it was appropriate that he would have the firearm out. Clearly he didn’t either, because he didn’t take it out.” Rolfe and the other officer present also failed to remove the child from the house prior to searching it for Walker, Barram said, which he believed was also inconsistent with police training. Barram added that they may not have even needed to search the house given they had already been given information about where Walker could be. The court has heard that Rolfe and his colleagues were told at House 577 that Walker might be at another property, House 511. Rolfe’s colleague, constable Adam Eberl, previously gave evidence that after receiving this information, the officers travelled to House 511, but no plan was made between them about what to do if they found Walker, or if he was armed. Barram said there was no reason why a plan regarding the visit to House 511 could not have been made by the officers, as is reinforced in their training. “There was no urgency for them to go into that house at all,” he said. “They had all the time in the world to discuss, plan, make some decisions about what would happen, utilise their … training, about if he is in there, what do we do.” He said making a plan would have allowed the officers time to consider “if/then thinking”, a principle of their training which reinforces the need for police to workshop how they may react if an offender behaves in a certain way. The purpose of this, Barram told the court, was “so that you can turn an unplanned incident into a planned response and allow that critical thinking … rather than going into a situation and letting it dictate to you”. Once Rolfe and his colleague, then-constable Adam Eberl, entered House 511 and saw Walker walking towards them with a hand in his pocket, the officers again acted against their training, Barram said in court. Barram said the officers should have stayed at the door to the property, giving them the ability to back outside and maintain space from Walker, and they should have asked him to show them his hands. “If you’ve got someone that you even suspect may be armed, first thing you’re going to want to do is see their hands,” Barram told the court. “So I don’t know why they persisted with going in … why would you put yourself in such close proximity to him? “There’s no … distance between them. Limited time to be able to react. Completely goes against our training.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Soon after giving this evidence, Barram added: “They’ve put themselves in close proximity to someone that they suspect was armed.” David Edwardson QC, for Rolfe, interjected: “Sorry, where’s the evidence of that?” To which Justice John Burns responded: “You can ask him that in due course”. Prosecutor Philip Strickland SC has told the court that the context to the alleged murder, including Rolfe’s training and any plans before attending House 511, must be considered alongside the shooting itself. But Edwardson has said Rolfe was acting within his training when he fired the shots, as he feared Walker continued to pose a threat to himself and Eberl. Barram will continue his evidence on Tuesday.",News/Australia news,"Zachary Rolfe trial: police officer acted against training, court hears",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/28/zachary-rolfe-trial-police-officer-acted-against-training-court-hears
2/28/2022,"With energy bills on their way up again from April, homeowners are looking skywards to try and ease the pressure on their budgets – by installing solar panels. The latest change to the regulator’s cap on default tariffs means, from spring, that the average annual dual-fuel bill will go up to £1,971, an increase of 54% on current levels. And with homeowners increasingly working from home, and therefore using more energy during the day, many are looking at installing panels to cut costs, and even earn from the energy they generate. Thomas Newby, chief executive of Leeds-based renewable energy company egg, says they received the same number of inquiries in the first nine days of this month as they did in the whole of November. “Many consumers are still on fixed deals but which will likely come to an end shortly, so I expect we may see a further increase in demand in the coming year,” he says. Solar panels convert energy from the sun into electricity. Stronger sunlight creates more electricity, which can then either be used in your home or exported to the national grid. But installing them comes at a cost. The average bill reaches almost £5,000 and rising labour bills and shortages of photovoltaic panels mean prices are going up. Domestic systems are generally made up of between 10 and 15 panels, each of which generate between 200W and 350W of energy, according to the Energy Saving Trust, a charity promoting energy efficiency. The more panels on the roof, the higher the installation cost but also the potential for more energy. The average price for an installation of a 3.5kW system is £4,800, including labour. This tends to be about 12 panels. “This is the average size for domestic systems in the UK,” says Brian Horne, senior insight and analytics consultant at the Energy Saving Trust. “The amount you pay for installation will be influenced by the size of the system, and will also be affected by any difficulty with access to your roof.” This price does not include the cost of a battery, which allows solar energy to be stored for use at a later time. They range between £1,200 and £6,000, according to GreenMatch, which compares green energy products. Although prices for solar systems have come down over the last decade, the increased cost of labour as well as the shortage in panels from China recently, has sent costs on the way back up, says Newby. “That’s as a result of some increase in material prices but, more generally, it is labour. That’s a big part of the job.” The ideal roof for solar panels is south-facing. East- or west- facing roofs yield up to 20% less energy; north-facing ones are the least productive and deemed to be impractical in the UK. For a 3.5kW system you need room for 15 to 20 sq metres of panels. The best results will be achieved from a roof angled at 30 degrees. Most UK roofs are between 30 and 45 degrees, according to consumer group Which?. Solar panels are classed as permitted developments so in most cases will not require planning permission. However, if you live in a listed building or a conservation area, there may be restrictions. It is best to contact your local council to be absolutely clear. When solar panels are to be installed, the company which brings electricity to your home – the Distribution Network Operator (DNO) – must be informed. The Energy Networks Association has an online tool which, by entering your postcode, will tell you which company operates in your area. If a solar system is above a certain size, prior permission is needed from the DNO and can take up to three months to obtain, according to Newby. After the preparation for putting the system in place is complete, installing the panels can take one to two days. Under the Smart Export Guarantee (SEG), households can get paid for electricity that they do not use which is exported back to the grid. You can shop around to get the best price for the energy you are creating. The trade association Solar Energy UK lists the best rates for homes feeding back into the grid. Tesla’s Energy Plan tops its table, paying 12p per kWh, although it requires you to have one of its own Powerwall batteries installed. Octopus energy pays 7.5p per kWh. The savings on your bills, and how long it will take to recoup the money invested, vary depending on where a home is, whether electricity is sold back to the grid and how much energy you use. In London, a property where residents are at home all day and selling energy back to the grid can make savings of £385 a year, according to the Energy Saving Trust. The same home where residents are out until after 6pm and don’t feed electricity into the grid would save £120. In Stirling, Scotland, a home occupied for the day and feeding back saves £340 while the same house empty and not feeding in saves £110. The Energy Saving Trust says there has been little research on how solar panels affect the value of a property, but says those with better energy performance sell for more. “It seems likely their impact on house prices will increase following recent energy price rises and the associated focus on ways to reduce energy requirements and switch to renewable energy,” says Horne. A report from Solar Energy UK found homes with solar panels can increase in value by £1,800, following an analysis of property sales. The Microgeneration Certification Scheme (MCS) certifies products and installations used to produce electricity and heat from renewable sources, and should be used as a first stop to find accredited installers near you, says Horne. As costs vary, it is best to get three quotes before committing.",Lifestyle/Money,Solar panels: a ray of hope as energy prices go through the roof,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/28/solar-panels-a-ray-of-hope-as-energy-prices-go-through-the-roof
