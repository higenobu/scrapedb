4/29/2022,"Repentant American soldiers have presented an Italian woman with a birthday cake to make up for the one their predecessors stole from her as it cooled on a windowsill 77 years ago. It was the eve of Meri Mion’s 13th birthday when US troops arrived in her village of San Pietro, near Vicenza in northern Italy, to fight against German soldiers. During the battle, her family spent the night in the attic, emerging the next day after German soldiers, who had fired shots near her home, retreated. Mion’s mother then set about baking a birthday cake, leaving it to cool by an open window, only for it to be stolen by presumably hungry American soldiers. An emotional Mion, who turns 90 on Friday, was presented with a replacement cake by soldiers from the US Army garrison in Italy during a ceremony at Giardini Salvi in Vicenza on Thursday. She said she had not been expecting the cake, although clearly remembered the moment the one baked for her 13th birthday “disappeared”. “I was surprised,” she told the local newspaper Il Giornale di Vicenza. “But then I realised the American soldiers had taken it and it made me happy. It was a good end given everything they had done.” The large cream cake with strawberries, garnished with a basket of mini Easter eggs, was presented by Sgt Peter Wallis and Col Matthew Gomlak, the garrison’s commander, during a ceremony attended by Italian and American soldiers, local officials and residents. Gomlak recalled the fighting between the US military and German forces in the Vicenza area in 1945, during which 19 American soldiers were killed, and how local residents offered the troops bread and wine. “That warm welcome by the people of Vicenza continues to this day,” he said. Mion said she would share the cake with her loved ones to mark her 90th birthday. “I will eat the cake with my entire family, remembering a wonderful day that I will never forget.”",News/World news,US army replaces cake it stole from Italian girl 77 years ago,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/29/us-army-replaces-cake-stole-italian-girl
4/29/2022,"The National Crime Agency has launched a potential fraud investigation into a PPE company linked to Michelle Mone and searched the Tory peer’s shared home. The NCA investigation is into PPE Medpro, a company that secured more than £200m in government contracts near the start of the pandemic without public tender. On Wednesday, the agency searched several properties associated with the company in the Isle of Man and London. They included the Isle of Man office building where PPE Medpro is registered and the mansion where Lady Mone lives with her husband, the business magnate Douglas Barrowman. The Isle of Man constabulary confirmed that search warrants were executed at four addresses on the island on Wednesday “in support of an ongoing NCA investigation”. There were no arrests. More than a dozen law enforcement officers are understood to have turned up unexpectedly at the Knox House building in the island’s capital, Douglas, where the Isle of Man PPE Medpro company is registered. One witness described the building being guarded by officers both at its front and rear. They are understood to have seized documents, computers, phones and other electronic devices from the building. Also searched was a Wardour Street address in central London, the office of the UK-registered PPE Medpro company that was awarded two government contracts worth £203m. A member of staff at that building told the Guardian: “It’s a ‘no comment’ all round.” Lawyers for PPE Medpro declined to comment. There is no evidence that the NCA’s investigation is connected to matters that have previously been the subject of public controversy. However, the investigation is likely to resurface questions about the wider £12bn in PPE contracts the government awarded during the pandemic under emergency rules that bypassed normal competitive tender processes. It will also put renewed focus on both PPE Medpro and the process through which the company secured its government contracts. It has been the focus of multiple controversies in recent months that have embroiled Mone and other senior Tories including Michael Gove, Theodore Agnew and James Bethell. The company was one of 51 businesses that were processed through a “VIP lane” operated by the government to fast-track companies that had been recommended by politically connected individuals. The Guardian has previously reported that Mone approached Gove, Lord Agnew and Lord Bethell on behalf of PPE Medpro. All were at the time ministers involved in pandemic procurement. Mone appears to have been instrumental in PPE Medpro being entered into the “high priority” VIP lane by Agnew in May 2020. In January the Guardian reported that leaked files appeared to suggest Mone and Barrowman were secretly involved in the PPE Medpro business. At the time, Mone’s lawyers said in response that the Guardian’s findings were “grounded entirely on supposition and speculation and not based on accuracy”. The House of Lords standards commissioner, Martin Jelley, then launched an investigation, which is still ongoing, into whether Mone’s links to the company breached rules relating to members. She has denied any wrongdoing. Responding to previous stories, Mone’s lawyers have said any suggestion of an association or collusion between the Tory peer and PPE Medpro would be “inaccurate” and that she was not involved in the business. “Baroness Mone is neither an investor, director or shareholder in any way associated with PPE Medpro. She has never had any role or function in PPE Medpro, nor in the process by which contracts were awarded to PPE Medpro.” Mone’s lawyers have said that after she undertook the “simple, solitary and brief step” of referring PPE Medpro to the government she did nothing further in respect of the company. Lawyers for Barrowman have similarly distanced him from the company, but they have not commented on whether he financially benefited from the firm. It is not known whether the searches of PPE Medpro-associated properties are part of a wider investigation by the NCA into potential fraud related to PPE procurement during the pandemic. In a statement, the NCA said: “The NCA does not routinely confirm or deny the existence of investigations or the names of those who may or may not be under investigation.” PPE Medpro’s first government contract, worth £80.85m for the supply of face masks, was awarded by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) in late May 2020. The second, a £122m contract to supply 25m sterile surgical gowns, was awarded in June 2020 but has been the subject of a major contractual dispute. The government rejected PPE Medpro’s gowns after checks in the UK and has said it is seeking to recover its money through a dispute resolution process. PPE Medpro has maintained that it complied with the terms of its gowns contract and is entitled to keep the money it was paid.",News/Politics,Michelle Mone’s home raided as PPE firm linked to Tory peer investigated,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/29/nca-launches-investigation-ppe-firm-linked-to-michelle-mone
4/29/2022,"Does Jacki Weaver have authority here? Unlike her namesake Jackie Weaver – the council official who became a viral star – no one would ever dare question the credentials of this formidable Aussie actor, twice Oscar nominated and almost 60 years in the business. Weaver was an established star in Australia, better known for her work in the theatre and on film than on TV (amazingly, she never ventured into soaps) long before she shot to international fame for her performance as a terrifying matriarch in 2010’s film Animal Kingdom. Two years later, she received her second Oscar nod, this time for playing Robert De Niro’s wife – and Bradley Cooper’s mother – in Silver Linings Playbook. Next up: another high-profile role, as the mother to Mark Wahlberg’s boxer-turned-priest in Father Stu, this time married to another challenging fella: Mel Gibson. Weaver had an early role in Peter Weir’s Picnic at Hanging Rock and was mentored by Michael Powell. Recent movies have included The Five-Year Engagement, Park Chan-wook’s Stoker, Steve McQueen’s Widows, Netflix smash Bird Box, plus Melissa McCarthy vehicle Life of the Party and a couple of James Franco-directed films about film-making, The Disaster Artist and Zeroville. So post your questions for this star of stage and screen and robust romantic, who wrote in her memoir: “‘Promiscuous’ implies that I’m not choosy. In fact I’m very choosy. I just happen to have had a lot of choices.” Comments will close at midnight UK time (11pm GMT) on 1 May and Weaver’s responses will be published in Film & Music next Friday.

4/29/2022,"A growing number of non-white women are resorting to alternatives to hospitals for labor and delivery in the US, a new report has revealed. According to the National Partnership for Women and Families, a nonprofit organization that focuses on public policies surrounding women and families, community births – births carried out at home or in community birthing centers – increased by 20% from 2019 to 2020, with the spike largely situated among communities of color. The increase for Black, non-Hispanic women was 30%, followed by 26% among Native Americans, 24% for Hispanic women, and 18% for both Asian and white women. Community births among native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander women rose by 13%. The report also found that in recent years, severe maternal morbidity (SMM), which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines as unexpected outcomes of labor and delivery that result in significant short- or long-term consequences to a woman’s health, increased overall and especially among people of color. From 2014 to 2017, Black women were three times more likely to experience pregnancy-related deaths compared to white, non-Hispanic women. For Native women, the rate is twice as likely. In its report, the NPWF cited various obstacles that limit access to care in community birth settings, including barriers to the growth of midwifery workforce, costs needed to establish and operate birth centers, inconsistent reimbursement of Medicaid and other reimbursement of midwifery and birth center services, as well as failure to license and regular birth centers across all states. The report proceeded to cite a list of policy considerations for state and federal policymakers to expand access to community birthing, saying: “Birth centers and home births are safe options for essentially healthy birthing families in the context of policies and practices that integrate community birth providers into the maternity care system.” “Care in these settings that is led by Black, Indigenous, People of Color is a crucial approach for meeting the needs of communities affected by structural racism and other forms of discrimination,” it added. Policy recommendations include ensuring coverage of birth center services and their midwives by all federal providers and payers of maternity services, as well as including funds in appropriation bills to increase the supply of midwives who hold three nationally recognized credentials. The report urged state and territorial policymakers to enact birth center licensure without unnecessary legal restrictions that limit access in the states that currently do not have regular birth centers. It also urged private sector decision makers to educate employed and beneficiaries about the benefits of midwifery-led care in community birth settings. “Now, more than ever, it’s important to find ways to support these choices in many ways that could be lifesaving,” Sinsi Hernández-Cancio, a co-author of the report and the NPWF’s vice president for health initiatives, told the Washington Post. “Most birthing people can safely give birth in a birthing center or at home, but the availability is very limited,” she added.",News/US news,US women of color increasingly seeking alternatives to hospital births – study,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/29/us-hospital-home-births-women-of-color

4/29/2022,"Any restaurant with a “concept” makes me slightly nervous. “Do you understand the concept?” I’ve been asked many times over the years. Sometimes, if the staff are being jollier, it’s merely a “Have you dined with us before?” as a lead-up to explaining that everything is served “family-style”, “in no particular order” or “is made only from things rescued from bins”; in one place, I was allowed my next course only after I’d indicated I’d finished my current one by holding up a specific paper flag on a cocktail stick. Thankfully, Dai Chi’s only concept is that almost all its dishes come on skewers, Japanese kushiage-style (ie, pub food). That said, most of these skewers are deep-fried and often breadcrumbed, so they’re instead describing the restaurant as a kushikatsu, which is big in Osaka. At Dai Chi, that means you get the likes of a single, top-quality black Iberiko tomato, breadcrumbed, on a skewer, with one meaningful anchovy draped over the top. Please eat it all in one go, chomp, down the hatch, because any attempt to nibble on it will result in some serious mopping of your décolletage. Another notable skewer is a large, breaded eringi mushroom with a solo carabinero on top. There are non-skewered items, too, and all are just as delicious – and brief: a titchy tuna tobiko taco and a winter leaf filled with burrata and dotted with wobbly, pink salmon roe. You can plump for the £38, six-course omakase menu or go rogue on the à la carte, which would involve attempting to work out how many skewers you need of each item to ensure that dinner feels like it actually happened. I watched, with some anxiety, as other tables tried to do just this, and it made me wonder if kushikatsu isn’t perhaps better suited to informal picking and sipping in a bar, rather than to a proper dinner in a fancy restaurant. Mind you, every time I quibbled about something or other, another mouthful of something gorgeous on a stick turned up and I couldn’t fault the love, care and skill at play. One of the first courses, a small plate of hamachi (amberjack) with truffle soy and furikake, came garnished with delicate shiso flower and was one of the loveliest, most fragrant, moreish plates of this particular fish I’ve ever had. A second course was a tiny segment of glossy Hokkaido milk bun with two slices of sweet, especially good tomato. The presentation is artistic, alluring and makes picking up the item in question and dispatching it in two bites feel almost crass. Dai Chi is the second London restaurant from the people behind Angelina in Dalston, where the concept is Japan meets Italy – mortadella with nasu dengaku, say, or crab with wasabi tobiko. From the outset, Angelina has been quietly respected for slightly skew-whiff notions that it pulls off with aplomb – you’d never call these people boring. At Dai Chi, the mood is similarly delightfully odd. I arrived to Summertime by DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince blaring out across the room, which then merged into Don’t Break My Heart by UB40. There are far too few floor staff, and no non-alcoholic options on the cocktail list, despite them stocking a lovely array of ginger, plum and peppercorn shrubs. Moreover, once we’d had our first round of drinks, there was no further offer of any more. Then again, all the front-of-house were spending an awful lot of time at each table, hand-holding customers through the concept. By the time we were five courses into the omakase, I began to feel that I was destined to be slightly hungry by the end. Charles, on the other hand, has one of those ever-present hungers that makes me feel as if I’m living with an anthropomorphised, coal-burning locomotive that constantly needs new bags of fuel shovelled into its ever-demanding furnace. Seven skewers and some sashimi with petals is an amuse-bouche for his type of appetite; yes, even though one of those skewers featured the most incredibly tender tuna, crumbed and dotted with wasabi, and another – and the star of the entire show – breaded aged beef showered with sea salt. At this point, you could elect to add Kagoshima wagyu with wasabi onion ponzu for an extra £55 for two, but I found that out only after analysing the menu once I’d got home, because no one bothered to mention it at the time. Pudding was a slice of delightful poached pear in miso ricotta, with genuinely wonderful, rich, dreamy ricotta and an inch or so of perfectly soft, purple pear steeped in some sort of sweet wine – heaven. Dai Chi is clever, unusual, exciting and strange, and it’s offering some of the most fantastic cooking in London, although things could get very expensive for larger groups going à la carte. Like all the best things, it left me wanting more. Dai Chi 16a D’Arblay Street, London W1, 020-7734 1449. Open evenings only, Tues-Sat, 5.15-11.30pm (midnight Fri & Sat).

4/29/2022,"A remarkable piece of narrative reporting and a sweeping family saga, New Yorker writer Patrick Radden Keefe’s award-winning book about the Sackler family and its role in America’s opioid crisis begins with the seemingly heart-warming tale of three Brooklyn brothers realising the dreams of their immigrant parents by becoming doctors. The Sacklers ­went on to become one of the richest families in the US – they have an estimated fortune of $14bn – known for their philanthropy and feted for their donations to art galleries, universities and medical institutes. Drawing on newly available court documents and more than 200 interviews, Empire of Pain reveals how the family made its money from the suffering of Americans through the aggressive sales techniques of Purdue, the Connecticut-based pharmaceutical company that became the biggest producer of OxyContin. The slow-release painkiller is twice as powerful as morphine and significantly more addictive. Approved by an official at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) who, a year later, took a high-paying job at Purdue, the drug contributed to the deaths of nearly 500,000 people over 20 years and wrecked the lives of millions more.Keefe, who narrates his book, is no stranger to audio: many listeners will know his voice from the hit podcast Wind of Change, which investigated the rumour that the titular power ballad by German rockers Scorpions was written by the CIA. If the vibe there was one of amusement, here he adopts a calmly astonished tone as he tells a shocking story of callousness, cover-ups and monumental greed.

4/29/2022,"Andy Beckett is right to entreat the Labour party to paint the Conservatives as the party of disorder (The Tories profited from Labour ‘chaos’ in the 1970s. Can Starmer do the same now?, 22 April). But Labour needs to do much more than this to win back ex-Labour voters and win over new voters – it must set out a clear vision and set of policies to achieve it. Keir Starmer needs to move on from his parliamentary focus of forensically dissecting of this government’s incompetence and corruption. That has been effective and is recognised by all but the most blinkered voter. He now needs to move out from the parliamentary capsule and articulate how he, as a Labour prime minister, would rid the country of its current politics of corruption, privilege, division and incompetence. He needs to convince the wider public of how, as leader committed to fair, open and honest politics, he will focus on the day-to-day concerns of the majority of voters – dealing with cost-of-living crisis, improving the NHS and other public services, developing housing opportunities for all, and creating secure and stable employment. Only then will voters begin to recognise that Labour has a leader who can offer a true alternative to this chaotic and dishonest government.Peter RiddleWirksworth, Derbyshire  Andy Beckett is right to point out that the Tories were in office for almost half of the 1970s. But it must also be emphasised that they were in charge for the first half of that decade, when most of the damage occurred. Some of it was unavoidable (Richard Nixon’s dismantling of the Bretton Woods currency arrangements), some the result of our foreign policy (angry Gulf states squeezing the oil taps on us after the Yom Kippur war), politically driven union militancy in the days before the laws demanded secret ballots and a cooling-off period, and finally the “Barber boom”, when Heath’s chancellor relaxed credit controls and caused a mini boom and bust that presaged the major one caused by Thatcher and Lawson a decade later. When Labour took office, it was faced with the need to go to the International Monetary Fund for a loan, but it was later revealed that the civil service had got its sums wrong and we didn’t need anything like the amount involved. Andy Beckett is right about the narrow majorities of the parties in the 70s, and particularly right about the vicious and partisan nature of today’s press. Starmer might do worse than re-employing Tony Blair’s attack dog, Alastair Campbell.David RedshawGravesend, Kent  Andy Beckett’s advice to Keir Starmer suggests that the Labour leader is presenting himself as a cautious figure. There are two major contributors to that caution – his party’s internal struggles and the related pressure to avoid talking about Brexit as an economic disaster and the shredding of Britain’s international influence. On the first, Starmer could warn other party leaders about the traditions of not interfering in private grief lest it throws emphasis on the internal problems of their own parties.

Labour’s proposal of £6bn a year for this over the next decade is a useful beginning, but much bigger sums will be required. A nationwide energy efficiency programme could easily be funded by the redirecting of savings through for example green recovery bond Isas. The Office for National Statistics has estimated that there are £1,933bn of net savings in the UK in addition to pension wealth of £6,445bn. Some of this could be leveraged to raise the tens of billions of pounds needed to make all the UK’s 30m homes energy efficient, creating in the process jobs in every constituency.Colin HinesConvener, UK Green New Deal Group",Lifestyle/Money,Redirect savings for a green recovery | Letter,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/29/redirect-savings-for-a-green-recovery
4/29/2022,"Last week in our regular You Be the Guide section of this here newsletter, we asked you to recommend books that would make for great film or TV adaptations. The response was massive: it turns out that, for all the books that were adapted into lousy movies or shows, there are just as many, if not more, great books crying out to adapted into (hopefully) great movies or shows. So we’ve decided to devote this week’s newsletter to a bumper selection of your recommendations, along with some picks from our culture writers too. War epics, period romps, supernatural chillers: there are some terrific suggestions here that really should be getting optioned any second now – but even if they don’t, our list should hopefully double up as a helpful guide to some great new reads. I’d love to see a film version of Ponzi’s Scheme: The True Story Of A Financial Legend by Mitchell Zuckoff. It tells the story of Charles Ponzi, who arrived in the US as a penniless Italian immigrant in the 1920s, and went on to invent the Ponzi scheme, becoming the toast of greedy high society for his trick. It would be a great “charming sociopath” role for an actor like Jason Sudeikis. – Peter Bradshaw, Guardian film critic Maggie Shipstead’s huge, gorgeous novel Great Circle – about the life of a female aviator and the Hollywood star who is playing her in a biopic – was my favourite book of last year. It’s part-western, part-war epic, part-adventure story, part-Hollywood satire, and so much more besides. It would need a mega-budget to do it justice, but if they can make something as strange and wonderful as Station Eleven into a television series, then there’s no reason this couldn’t be done. – Rebecca Nicholson, Guardian TV writer A slightly niche choice, but I absolutely loved the book Sounds Like Titanic by Jessica Chiccehitto-Hindman, who was part of a fake orchestra who conned audiences across America with their too-perfect recitals, which were actually a CD recording. I think this “classical Milli Vanilli” story could be an amazing miniseries – and Maude Apatow looks a bit like Jessica come to think of it … – Hannah J Davies, deputy editor, newsletters The elaborate bank job at the heart of The Mark and the Void by Paul Murray means that it’s already a book with an in-built cinematic feel. Add in the physical comedy of the robbers utterly botching it, and you have the kind of goofy crime caper that’s just begging for a primetime Sunday night slot. – Alexi Duggins, deputy TV editor and writer of the Hear Here newsletter Ta-Nehisi Coates’ The Water Dancer is a moving, complex book that combines history with magical realism. It tackles slavery in a vivid way, and would lend itself perfectly to the screen. – Nimo Omer, assistant editor, First Edition newsletter We’ve never had a definitive Kurt Cobain biopic – all the more galling then that the source material is already there. Heavier Than Heaven, Charles R Cross’s celebrated biography, vividly charts the Nirvana frontman’s progression from shy child to reluctant rock god. Anton Corbijn, director of the band’s iconic Heart Shaped Box video and the Ian Curtis biopic Control would be the perfect choice to direct. – Alex Mistlin, culture commissioning editor, Guardian Saturday Open Water, Caleb Azumah Nelson’s debut, is one of the best books I’ve read in the last couple of years. The British-Ghanaian novelist is a photographer as well as a writer, so it’s not surprising that the slim volume already feels cinematic in style, bringing to life the hazy London summer in which it’s set. The slow-burning love story between two young Black artists is just begging to become an award-winning indie film – someone please snap up the rights?! – Lucy Knight, books commissioning editor Ducks, Newburyport by Lucy Ellmann. A thousand pages made up of only eight sentences: this is truly the Mission: Impossible of screen adaptations, a meandering narrative so impossibly dense it would need more episodes than Grey’s Anatomy to simply scratch the surface. – Ammar Kalia, Guardian culture writer Joe Abercrombie’s First Law books are absolutely begging to be adapted for TV. Grittier and much, much funnier than Game Of Thrones, they eschew dragons and only hint at magic, instead preferring to concentrate on character and, you know, cohesive plotting and themes. Sandy Nelson I absolutely love Carlos Ruiz Zafon’s Shadow of the Wind and its subsequent sequels and prequels. I’m convinced they’d make wonderfully rich epics but if I’m not mistaken the author, who has since passed away, made it expressly clear that he never wanted that to happen, which I can understand. But still … Simon Marczycha Anything by Georgette Heyer! I love a costume drama and her Regency romances are gorgeous, witty and so, so enjoyable. Bernadette Stott I have always thought that a series based on the life of the novelist Frances Burney could be great. She wrote a bestselling novel at age 26 and became a celebrity; she served for five years at the court of King George III as his queen’s wardrobe mistress, living at Windsor, and her diaries describe his psychotic episodes first-hand; she was a member of the bluestockings of London, and a favourite of Dr Samuel Johnson; she had a mastectomy without anaesthesia for cancer or an abscess; she married a dashing French émigré general after the French Revolution; she was living in Paris during Napoleon’s return from Elba, fleeing the city to describe the battle of Waterloo. Her father was a famous musician and historian of music, she heard and met the great singers and musicians of the time. What more would one want? Donna Bergen I’ve always wanted to see a version of The Yiddish Policeman’s Union by Michael Chabon made into a TV series – it seemed ripe for the Coen Brothers to do it, maybe there’s been a few too many counter-factual shows recently – The Plot Against America for one but I still think it would make a great show. Derek O’Neill The Secret History by Donna Tartt. I loved this book when I was an impressionable university student. I think a film adaptation was mooted in the 90s but it would be perfect for a TV adaptation, maybe in six parts on Apple or HBO. It has nostalgic 80/90s vibes, which are all the rage, and a classic ‘outsider trying to fit in with the cool kids’ story that jumps backwards and forwards. I imagine if it was on Netflix it would turn into a parody of Cruel Intentions, or just a dull slog if it was on Amazon. Tupon Bhowmik The Poisonwood Bible, by Barbara Kingsolver – all her books are fab but this one is her best, in my humble opinion. It’s probably too long to make into a really good film, but it would be a terrific epic. Valerie Mitchell The book I would love to see adapted is A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara. I think it screams movie adaptation given it is so tightly bound by the strange but endearing mix of characters and the friendship that unites them. It is an incredibly powerful and emotive study on sexual abuse, along with its pernicious suffering the act causes and the difficult road of recovery. Jason Wasiak I was only thinking yesterday that Matt Wesolowski’s Six Stories series of books about a podcaster who revisits old mysterious crimes would be fantastic as a TV series. Every book is told from six different points of view – six people who were involved in the crime in question. Each story has a supernatural slant (possession, changelings, haunted woods, cult-style killings) and they can be properly terrifying, but are always very clever and satisfying.

4/29/2022,"As far as we know, there’s no such thing as time travel in the Avatar universe, which is weird because there was a distinct whiff of 2009 coming off this week’s industry reports about a screening of the first trailer for the newly titled Avatar: The Way of Water. The Hollywood Reporter said delegates at CinemaCon in Las Vegas were wowed by the movie’s impressive 3D and high frame rate, which 20th Century Fox and Disney will be rolling out across the globe when the movie finally hits multiplexes in December. You’d think not more than a couple of years had gone by since the release of the original Avatar, a time when it felt like the entire film industry was about to go through a radical journey into high-end stereoscopy and accelerated frame rates. Unfortunately for Hollywood, it has actually been more than a decade since we last hung out with Jake Sully and his Na’vi comrades. Are we expected to get excited about this stuff all over again? The problem with 3D is that it has had more comings than Jesus caught in a time loop. There was the original 1950s phase, then that brief period in the 1980s when Jaws 3-D landed at cinemas, and finally around 2009 when James Cameron seemed to think stereoscopic film-making was about to become more popular than the Beatles. In between now and then we’ve also had 3D TVs, which ran out of steam around 2017 amid a chorus of unbothered shrugs. As for higher frame rates, Peter Jackson was forced to dull down his Hobbit trilogy after viewers complained they didn’t really need to see Bombur’s blackheads in such excruciating detail when viewing An Unexpected Journey at 48-frames per second. Cameron would argue, and has many times, that the problem with such highfalutin tech is that only he is capable of executing it properly. As a result of Avatar, every studio started releasing movies in 3D because Hollywood worked out that it could add a premium to ticket prices for those screenings. Most of these films, unlike Avatar, were shot in 2D and then converted in postproduction, a method some studios claimed made no difference to the finished result. This wasn’t always the case. Anyone unfortunate enough to view 2010’s Clash of the Titans in stereoscopy will be well aware that some conversions made for an experience roughly equivalent to having your eyes put through a meat grinder repeatedly for 90 minutes-plus. Others just gave people a headache. Perhaps Avatar: The Way of Water will turn all this around, and we’ll suddenly start reaching for the 3D glasses and willingly paying that extra £3 all over again. But it seems unlikely. The problem for Hollywood is that Avatar movies seem to come along only once a decade (Cameron says Avatar 3 will arrive in 2024, but we’ll believe that when we see it), which means we’re probably going to have to sit through a hell of a lot of bad or pointlessly 3D movies before the next one comes out. Having said all this, there’s something ineluctably attractive about the idea that you’re about to witness a movie that will look and sound better than anything ever seen in the multiplex. This is precisely why Avatar broke the world record for highest box office gross in the first place – it certainly can’t have been for its original storytelling – and why Greenwich Imax is usually a lot more packed out than the Odeon in Beckenham, despite tickets at the latter costing about a quarter of the price. Avatar: The Way of Water promises to envelop us once again in the gloriously trippy flora and fauna of Pandora. This time we’re told we will be visiting a coastal Na’vi tribe and be introduced to various new water creatures, all of whom we can assume will still have those swishy USB-compatible tails that allow them to connect to Jake and Neytiri. We’ll also discover (I hope) how the bejesus Sigourney Weaver’s Dr Grace Augustine and baddie Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) are still alive, despite both having been conked in the previous movie. We might even find out why, on Pandora, Kate Winslet had to learn to hold her breath for seven minutes under water, despite playing a Na’vi through (we presume) motion capture. It’s all going to be splendid. Will it reinvigorate the 3D/high frame-rate revolution once again? Let’s face it, the chances of this happening are about as high as Quaritch coming back as a sentient tree. On the other hand, this is a world where Gaia actually is a sentient tree that can be tapped up for a quick chat about the weather whenever you fancy it, as well as a world in which mountains float. Stranger things have happened.",Arts/Film,"Is anyone excited about Avatar 2, or is James Cameron’s 3D revolution doomed?",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/29/avatar-2-the-way-of-water-james-cameron-3d
4/29/2022,"The Foreign Office (FCDO) is seeking more information about claims that two British men who went to Ukraine to provide humanitarian aid have been captured by the Russian military. An NGO said that it had passed on details to the department after the men were detained by Russian forces in southern Ukraine having gone into an area to help bring out a family. Presidium Network, a UK-based organisation that says it carries out evacuations of families and individuals from warzones, said it was aware of the men, who travelled to Ukraine on a “freelance basis”. A spokesperson for Presidium said it was in contact with the mother of one of the men – who it had last communicated with on Monday. The organisation said it had been intending to work with the men, who were missing south of Zaporizhzhia, and provided details of messages in which they had reported their location. Both appeared to be members of the public with little or no experience of military or humanitarian work. There was no immediate comment from the FCDO. “The Foreign Office is doing all it can to support and identify these two people,” the British trade minister, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, told Sky News. The Institute for the Study of War thinktank, warned this week that Russian forces were stepping up operations to abduct Ukrainian citizens for use in prisoner exchanges. On Thursday, the Foreign Office confirmed that a British citizen had been killed in Ukraine and a second was missing, amid reports that both were volunteers who had gone to fight in the country. The Briton who died was understood to be Scott Sibley, a former soldier who had served overseas. Ex-colleagues paid tribute on a Facebook page run by veterans of the commandos logistics support squadron, where he was described as a man who had “showed commando spirit until the end”. Sibley is believed to be the first British fighter known to have been killed in combat in Ukraine. A small number of serving British personnel are understood to have gone absent without leave to join the resistance against the Russian invasion, while veterans and Britons without combat experience are thought to have also travelled to Ukraine. There was initially confusion about the government’s position after the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, in comments during an interview to the BBC on February 26, said she would “absolutely” support UK nationals who chose to fight for Ukraine. The Facebook page where tributes were paid to Sibley posted what was understood to be a photo of him while serving in the military in his younger days. He is seen in uniform, standing at what appears to be Bagram airfield in Afghanistan.",News/Politics,Foreign Office looking into claims two Britons captured in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/29/foreign-office-looking-into-claims-two-britons-captured-in-ukraine
4/29/2022,"It promises to be an exciting couple of months for Tony Roberts, a key part of the Wolves and Wales staff, as his club chase a European place and his country a spot at a first World Cup since 1958. The goalkeeping coach can often be seen orchestrating from the edge of the technical area and Roberts, a colourful character who also counts set pieces as his responsibility, is held in high regard by players and staff. “I’ve always been lively,” Roberts says from Wolves’ training base. “I’m not one to sit still. If I go on holiday I can’t stand the sun, I’d rather go on the bike, so it’s Center Parcs for me instead shooting off wherever.” Roberts is a bubbly personality with a ton of tales from more than three decades in the game. He played until the age of 42, combining turning out for Dagenham & Redbridge, for whom he made more than 450 appearances, with coaching Arsenal’s youth goalkeepers after taking a call from the then academy director Liam Brady while at Queens Park Rangers. He worked with a 17-year-old Wojciech Szczesny as well as with Lukasz Fabianski, with whom he was later reunited at Swansea, and Emiliano Martínez, before being appointed assistant first-team goalkeeping coach, which meant working with Jens Lehmann and under Arsène Wenger. “The most intelligent man in the world,” he says. Roberts’s energy is infectious. Last year a prank which centred on Adama Traoré, when he accused the winger of lacking physicality in a team meeting, went viral. Roberts is the only non-Portuguese member of Bruno Lage’s coaching staff but the pair previously worked together at Swansea, where Lage was assistant to Carlos Carvalhal. Reuniting last summer was a no-brainer. “I had just met up with the Wales squad for the Euros and he FaceTimed me at about 11.30pm. I was in bed, hair all over the place, and he said: ‘Tony, Tony, we’re going into Wolves.’ I was like: ‘Yeah, yeah, whatever.’ This is the thing about the Portuguese, the WhatsApp group we have, it comes alive at about one o’clock in the morning. They’re crazy. I have to put my phone on silent because I wake up to about 15 messages.” Conversation flows with Roberts, be it discussing his homework on José Sá, eating pastéis de nata in the office, dreaming of representing Wales at a World Cup as a kid in Holyhead, or ribbing the Wolves captain, Conor Coady, about the prospect of facing England in Qatar, a reality if Wales secure qualification in June. “Oh, the last game … to win the group? Unbelievable,” he says, deadpan. “If we get there, I’m going to switch my phone off to stop the temptation of battering Coady because I know he’ll be battering me. We met up for the [Aston] Villa game [the day after the draw] and Coady was giving me stick on the bus. We’ve got to get there first. Touch wood.” The day before a game Roberts holds a goalkeeper meeting to pinpoint opposition threats. Sá, a £7m signing from Olympiacos, has been a major success – one of the Premier League signings of the season – and a key part of a sturdy backline; only the division’s top three teams have conceded fewer goals than Wolves and only Manchester City fewer from set pieces. Roberts analysed about 20 of Sá’s games in full before editing clips, split into sections from coping with crosses to shot-stopping, to share with staff. “I liked what I saw. He is quick, athletic and agile, and that’s what the role needs. All the credit goes to him because he has taken everything on board.” This month the former Wolves goalkeeper Carl Ikeme, who retired in 2018 a year after being diagnosed with acute leukaemia, returned to the club’s Compton base for his first training session in almost five years. “He slotted right in and, give me a couple of weeks with him, I think he would be back in the squad,” Roberts says, laughing. “It was brilliant. Brenda upstairs [in the canteen], who has worked here for 20 years, her eyes lit up and they had a little hug.” Roberts, who left home at 16 to join QPR, sees parallels between Wales and Wolves. “The spirit they’ve got in the [Wales] team, and we’ve got with the staff, it’s just like being here, like being at a club. We can’t wait to go away because you know, [it’s] like somebody [David Edwards] said about [Euro] 2016 being like going on holiday with all of your mates, but you’re playing football matches. I keep saying it: this environment is top and it reminds me of that.” Lage said Wolves were “waiting on Tony” after players including the Mexico striker Raúl Jiménez, the Morocco captain, Romain Saïss, and the Portuguese trio Sá, Rúben Neves and João Moutinho sealed qualification for Qatar 2022 last month. “At one point I thought Wales were going to get into a group with Portugal and I thought: ‘Oh, here we go,’” he smiles. “I was involved in the Wales team when we nearly got there, USA 94. We missed out when [Paul] Bodin hit the crossbar against Romania. I bawled my eyes out that night and to get there now, I think I’d be crying at 52 years old.” Roberts will join up with Wales on the evening Wolves’ campaign ends at Liverpool to prepare for a Nations League opener in Poland and a World Cup play-off final against Scotland or Ukraine. For now, the focus is on Saturday, when Wolves host Brighton hoping to reignite their European push after six defeats in nine matches. Roberts smiles at the suggestion his passport is filling up after trips to Amsterdam, Baku and Rome with Wales at Euro 2020. “Well, I could do with a few more,” he says. “We want to get into Europe.”",Sport/Football,Wolves’ Tony Roberts: ‘The WhatsApp group we have comes alive at 1am’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/29/wolves-tony-roberts-wales-goalkeeping-coach
