2/9/2022,"A Colorado county clerk who has pushed election lies was arrested on Tuesday. During the arrest, Peters appears to kick at an officer trying to seize her iPad. The arrest is unrelated to a lawsuit brought by the Colorado secretary of state, accusing her of leaking election data. Tina Peters, a pro-Trump elections clerk in Mesa County, Colorado — who is the subject of a grand jury investigation into alleged election tampering and official misconduct — appeared to kick at a police officer as she was being arrested on Tuesday, according to a video shared by local news station KUSA reporter Kyle Clark. The arrest in Grand Junction, Colorado, was unrelated to the election investigation. According to a tweeted statement from the Grand Junction Police Department, authorities were trying to execute a warrant issued by the Mesa County District Attorney's Office, leading to the arrest. According to KUSA, the warrant was for Peters' iPad. Peters is suspected of using her iPad to record a court proceeding for her deputy clerk Belinda Knisley. Knisley is accused of introducing a security vulnerability into Mesa County's election systems. Taking video was not authorized, and according to the affidavit for the warrant, there were notices not to film posted in the courtroom. A judge also warned that if he found somebody was recording ""he would take appropriate legal action,"" per the affidavit viewed by Colorado Public Radio. A paralegal and deputy district attorney observed Peters operating the ""camera"" app on the iPad during the hearing, which would constitute a felony offense, Colorado Politics reported, citing a search warrant. Peters was arrested after failing to comply with officers' search warrant, according to Grand Junction police. In a statement posted on Twitter, the police department said she was ""arrested and released on scene, pending charges related to this incident."" Peters' office did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. In an emailed statement to the Denver Post, a spokesman for her legal defense fund said, ""The search warrant presented listed exactly one item, an iPad with a white case."" ""Clerk Peters complied with that, then officers began attempting to take other items of personal property, not listed in the warrant including her car keys, which is illegal,"" Rory McShane, the spokesman, continued. —Kyle Clark (@KyleClark) February 8, 2022 Peters has been the subject of national attention in the summer of 2021. Information that appeared to be from her county's voting machines was presented at MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell's ""Cyber Symposium"" conference in August, which she attended. The information also circulated among QAnon influencers like Ron Watkins. In summer 2021, Peters, a Republican, was sued by the Colorado secretary of state and accused of allowing a security breach of the county's election equipment, according to the lawsuit. Peters was removed from overseeing elections by a local judge, in November 2021. That same month, the FBI raided her home, ""in support of an ongoing investigation into the alleged election system breach in Mesa County.""

 A declining number of Americans say former President Trump bears primary responsibility for the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, according to new data from the Pew Research Center, a trend accompanied by a growing number who say he was not at all to blame for the riot. The results from Pew show that 43 percent of respondents view Trump as being primarily responsible for the attack, a drop from 52 percent last year. The surveys were taken shortly after the attack and its anniversary. The decrease in those who put the onus on Trump was seen among both Democrats and Republicans. The number of Republicans who say Trump bears no responsibility at all for the attack grew from 46 percent to 57 percent over the last year, while the share of Democrats who see Trump as having ""a lot"" of responsibility for the attack dropped from 81 percent to 70 percent. The survey also found the public largely divided over how much attention should be paid to the Jan. 6 attack and its impacts, with roughly a third of those surveyed responding that too much, too little and the right amount of attention has been given to reviewing the day. The poll was conducted between Jan. 10 and Jan. 17 among 5,128 U.S. adults. It has a margin of error of 2 percentage points.",Politics/The Hill,Declining share of Americans see Trump as primarily responsible for Jan. 6,https://news.yahoo.com/declining-share-americans-see-trump-205317142.html
