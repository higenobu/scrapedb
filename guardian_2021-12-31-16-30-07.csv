12/31/2021,"Leaders of a group of protesters who set fire to the facade of old Parliament House in Canberra are closely linked to a complex network of anti-vaccination and conspiracy groups which have been accused of spreading misinformation in Indigenous communities during the Covid-19 pandemic. The fire, which broke out during a protest at the entrance to the building on Thursday, caused extensive damage to the doors and portico.  There have been a series of demonstrations by Indigenous groups as well as elements of the anti-vaccination movement and sovereign citizen groups at old Parliament House over the past days. On 22 December another fire was lit at the entrance by the same group of protesters. A protester posted video of that fire on Instagram with the caption: “These Doors are Coming Down Either Way”. Among the protesters are Indigenous land rights activists, anti-vaccine groups and so-called sovereign citizens. The latter is a fringe conspiracy group rooted in antisemitism and organised around a haphazard collection of pseudo-legal beliefs broadly grouped around the notion that modern government is an illegitimate corporation. Like many other threads of conspiratorial thinking, sovereign citizens have enjoyed a confused renaissance during the pandemic. When footage began emerging during the early stages of Covid-19 of people asking police bizarre questions at border stops or describing themselves as a “a living woman” to Bunnings employees, it was largely as a result of sovereign citizen-inflected beliefs. Before the fire on Friday, a piece of paper was taped to a door at old Parliament House labelled a “notice of acquiescence by default”. It was addressed to, among others, “The Australian Commonwealth de facto Corporate Administration” and contained a garbled set of legalese mirroring sovereign citizen beliefs. FYI protesters in Canberra at Old Parliament house are a 'sovereign citizen' group with overlapping members in the 'freedom' movement. They've been turning up for the past few weeks. They posted this ""trespass"" notice on the building doors this week pic.twitter.com/ZDBNDNEbpu Intertwined with the protesters were various fringe anti-vaccination groups as well as members of the “freedom movement” which has pushed anti-lockdown protests during the Covid-19 pandemic before morphing into a catch-all conspiracy movement. Attempts by elements of the conspiracy movement to influence Indigenous groups have been well documented. As the Age has previously reported, some of those movements have been active in promoting misinformation in remote Indigenous communities. In September the Guardian revealed a group had attempted to push ivermectin into the remote regional town of Wilcannia during a Covid outbreak there. There is no evidence that ivermectin has any beneficial effect as a Covid treatment, and it may be harmful in some circumstances. Leaders of the Aboriginal Tent Embassy, established in 1972, condemned the actions that led to Thursday’s fire. “The actions of such protestors conducting a ‘smoking ceremony’ was done so without the knowledge, consent or mandate of the embassy council and traditional owners responsible for the regulation of the Aboriginal Tent Embassy,” it said in a statement. There were claims following the fire that it may have been the result of a smoking ceremony that got out of hand, or as a result of police using pepper spray to disperse the crowd. However, footage on social media showed that the fire was well lit before police arrived at the scene, and ACT police told the Age the pepper spray used was water-based and did not contain an accelerant. Footage taken by protesters themselves shows many of them celebrating after the fire began to engulf the front of the building. The protests were widely condemned by political leaders. Scott Morrison said it was “disgraceful”. “I’m disgusted and appalled by the behaviour that would see Australians come and set fire to such a symbol of democracy in this country,” the prime minister said on Thursday. But the Greens senator Lidia Thorpe, the party’s first Indigenous representative, wrote on Twitter: “Seems like the colonial system is burning down. Happy New Year everyone.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning She later deleted the tweet, and the party’s leader, Adam Bandt said: “Greens don’t want to see the planet burning or Old Parliament.” However, he did not publicly criticise Thorpe nor has she apologised for the comment. Old Parliament House now houses the Museum of Australian Democracy. Its director, Daryl Karp, called the fire “tragic” and said damage to the building was potentially irreparable. “To actually be closed, and to be closed because of violent protests is really tragic,” she told the ABC on Friday.",News/Australia news,Old Parliament House fire protesters linked to anti-vaccine and conspiracy groups,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/31/old-parliament-house-fire-protesters-linked-to-anti-vaccine-and-conspiracy-groups
12/31/2021,"The Victorian and New South Wales governments are scrambling to organise the distribution of rapid antigen tests to vulnerable people amid short supply, confusion over who should use them and skyrocketing Covid case numbers. Amid a national shortage of the tests, both governments said they were working out how best to distribute tens of millions of kits they have ordered, most of which will not arrive until the end of January.  NSW and Victoria have watered down previous commitments to provide free tests after a national cabinet meeting with the federal government on Thursday. Adding to the confusion, on Friday morning the prime minister, Scott Morrison, issued a statement removing a requirement that confirmed Covid cases who are in isolation but don’t have symptoms take a test on the sixth day. This directly contradicted statements, also made on Friday, by the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, and Victoria’s health minister, Martin Foley, that a day-six rapid test was required. The confusion unfolded as prominent Sydney charity worker the Rev Bill Crews warned that lessons from two years of the pandemic had not been learned, and the poorest and most vulnerable members of the community were being left behind. Crews, whose eponymous foundation distributes meals and runs a healthcare clinic, said the people his charity worked with were “like Petri dishes who’ll spread it”. “Our people are the most vulnerable and we have to look after them, and I would have expected them to be on some sort of priority list, at least equal to aged care, but they seem to be the forgotten people,” he said. Authorities in NSW and Victoria were not able to explain how their test stockpiles would be allocated and distributed. In NSW, where cases almost doubled on Friday for the third day running, jumping from 12,226 to 21,151, the premier, Dominic Perrottet, said he expected the “main set” of 50m of rapid antigen tests his government had ordered to arrive in mid-January. “There is a place I would say, definitely, for the state to be providing rapid antigen tests, for returning travellers into Sydney,” Perrottet said. “In addition to that, we want to make sure vulnerable people – vulnerable and disadvantaged communities – have access to rapid antigen tests. “We’re working through, currently, the distribution and the cohorts which we believe that those rapid antigen tests will be provided [to].” In Victoria, where Covid cases increased from 5,137 to 5,919 on Friday, the health minister, Martin Foley, said there was “a national shortage of rapid antigen tests”. “I acknowledge that, whether it’s in the government procurement or in the private market.” Foley said Victoria had taken “urgent measures” to buy 34m kits, which are to be delivered “in coming days and weeks”. “Victorians have come to, I think rightly, see testing as a key part of the ongoing public health response,” he said. “Free testing is a critical part of that. But at the moment we are really facing some challenges right across the country.” Covid commander Jeroen Weimar said distribution details for the government’s rapid antigen testing kits would be announced soon. “In the coming days we’ll be making more announcements around how we allocate those and shoot those through our testing centres,” he said. Crews said his charity needed 500 tests a week to keep his workers safe. “We’re frontline, all of our volunteers are on the frontline, everything,” he said. “We’ve spent so far nearly $20,000 on rapid antigen tests, which could have gone into meals. “We’re getting no help at all. I’m saying: what do you want us to spend the money on – rapid testing or feeding the homeless? “The rich have been able to stockpile these, because they’re able to pay any price for them, but the people we work with can’t – and we can’t stockpile them either. “Nobody seems to have learned anything – the poor, the homeless and the most vulnerable are still at the bottom of the heap.”",News/Australia news,NSW and Victoria unable to explain how Covid rapid antigen tests will be distributed to vulnerable,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/31/nsw-and-victoria-unable-to-explain-how-covid-rapid-antigen-tests-will-be-distributed-to-vulnerable
12/31/2021,"Queensland is due to change travel restrictions into the state despite a surge in fresh Covid cases and criticisms the new requirements are “pointless” in states with large outbreaks. From 11.59pm on Friday 31 December, travellers entering Queensland will be required to return a negative rapid antigen test (RAT) result within 72 hours before travel, rather than a negative PCR test.  The change in rules comes as the state recorded 3,118 new cases overnight, with the number of active infections rising to 11,697. Evidence of a negative test result has to be uploaded to the Queensland Health website when applying for a border pass, with applicants making a declaration the information is correct. However the change raises questions about the accuracy and reliability of test results, as unlike PCR tests, the tests are not performed by trained professionals or analysed by and reported to a central authority. Police commissioner Katarina Carroll said on Wednesday that from January those caught lying about a RAT result on their border declaration would face a heavy fine. “If you are intercepted at the airport, questions will be – when did you have the test, where was it, at what time? I ask everyone to abide by the requirements of the declaration, and if they’re found to be obviously making a false declaration, they will be heavily fined,” commissioner Carroll said. A spokesperson for the Queensland police said officers will be performing random compliance checks on travellers, though not all will be stopped as they enter the state by road or plane. “Officers may ask questions about your test – such as when it was conducted and see evidence of the test,” they said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A similar system was in operation in other jurisdictions such as South Australia until Friday when the premier Steven Marshall announced all border requirements for interstate travel to the state had been scrapped “effective immediately”. “There will no longer be a requirement for people coming across the border to do a rapid antigen test prior to coming into South Australia,” Marshall said. “This was discussed this morning at the Covid Ready committee. It was not a good use of our resources at the moment, and so the Entry Check requirement has been removed. The rapid antigen test requirement has been removed.” Australian Medical Association vice-president Dr Chris Moy said at this stage of the pandemic travel requirements like those within Queensland “didn’t make sense in a situation where there’s such a scarcity of RAT tests which could be better used”. “It’s pointless except if you’re going to somewhere where there’s very low or no Covid like WA or NT, where you’ve got a higher at risk population and relatively low numbers,” Moy said. “In an ideal world everyone coming from New South Wales would get tested before they travel.” In those situations where the tests were still useful, Moy said governments had no choice but to rely on the “honour system” though a “small minority” may lie about their results, there was no system in place to verify RAT results. “We don’t have either a strategy to introduce RAT tests or clear instructions about when to use it,” Moy said. “The problem is that you need a strategy that considers access, equity and clear instructions about when to [use a rapid antigen test] and when they’re the most benefit in terms of reducing a person’s risk of passing it to other people.” “These things are not set up. But at the end of the day you’re still trying to get people to do the right thing.”",News/Australia news,Queensland’s new travel rule labelled ‘pointless’ as state faces fresh Covid surge,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/31/queenslands-new-travel-rule-labelled-pointless-as-state-faces-fresh-covid-surge
12/31/2021,"At 42, I believed that my food and alcohol dependencies defined me. In my mirror, I would always be as I saw myself then: fat and drunk. I was over the hill and past the point of any meaningful change. Who, at my age, truly starts over? I had clearly missed the opportunity to be one of those healthy, mindful people I mocked on Instagram. I was who I was: destined to remain in those cycles of dependency and to be unhappy, discontent and stuck. Then disaster struck. The pandemic began as a drunken month of worsening depression, but I have since quit booze, taken up running and lost 7st (44kg). I am in the best mental shape of my life. It turns out booze – and a million social and work engagements – was covering up how unhappy I had become with myself and my life. I was hiding from spending time alone or thinking about who I had become: someone who regularly drank two bottles of wine a day, was medically obese and had done no exercise in four years.  From the outside, the life I had built as a writer and events manager in London looked glamorous and cosmopolitan. But it was all tits and teeth. Inside, I was grieving and trying to drink and eat myself numb. My mother had died in 2018 after a six-year illness with cancer, and I had spent three years pursuing rock bottom and experiencing very little joy. The numbness almost killed me. Lockdown, however, imposed the solitude from which I had been running. Of course, I tried to avoid it using 10-litre boxes (yes, plural) of rosé. Then I got sick with shingles. I was terrified it was Covid and that I was going to die in this state. So, I used the opportunity of the pubs being shut to end my lifelong relationship with booze. This led to huge changes. Five months later, I tackled the Couch to 5K programme. Then, on 15 October 2020, I took the plunge and joined an app for cognitive behavioural therapy and calorie-controlled weight loss. My original goal was to lose enough to place me in a normal BMI for the first time in my adult life. I had been size extra‑large since I was 18. I didn’t know anything else, so I wasn’t trying to regain some perfect figure from my youth. But I ended up losing enough to put me in the middle of the healthy weight band. None of it was easy; in fact, it was a daily battle. I had to make decisions every single day. To get outside. To eschew Deliveroo. To sit with my grief, rather than wallow in it. To sit with myself. To do 20,000 steps. To make soup. To dance. To cry. To feel. To get therapy. During the course of the year of my transformation, I ended my eight-year relationship with a man I loved, and still love, but from whom I had grown apart. I went on a solo honeymoon to the Maldives and came back to London with a new outlook. Then, within a month of returning to London, Sarah Everard went missing. I, along with the rest of the country, was watching and hoping that she would be found. As a single woman, living alone during Covid restrictions, I was furious when I heard that the police were telling women the only way to stay safe while alone was to remain in their own homes. Was I not meant to get groceries in case the delivery man was dangerous? Was I supposed to avoid taxis? I had tweeted about being devastated for Sarah’s family and that, as urban women, we deserved the right to walk home. The tweet blew up. So I tweeted that I would organise a vigil and I was put in touch with a group of women who were doing the same. Reclaim These Streets was born. Many readers will know what happened next. We planned a vigil in Sarah’s honour, but the police banned us from gathering, even though a serving police officer was suspected – and later convicted – of murdering her. We raised a legal fund and sued the Metropolitan police for our human right to protest. We went to the high court the day before the vigil and were told that we were permitted to protest within the parameters the police set, but the police refused to set parameters. They threatened us, as organisers, with £10,000 each in fines and prosecution under the Serious Crimes Act. We decided that, instead of wasting our money on such penalties, we would raise funds to serve the people who needed it. Many people attended the vigil anyway – and the police manhandled attenders and arrested four. The days that followed were some of the most intense, emotional and rewarding of my life. The women I worked with were, and are, incredible. On 19 March, we donated the £526,000 we had raised to Rosa, a funding group for women and girls, and created the Stand With Us fund. I would not have had the emotional capacity or stamina to have done the work if I had still been drinking. I would not have had the headspace or courage to put myself forward if I had not been in the best mental and physical place in my life. Raising my hand to be counted, and standing up for the safety of all of us, was only possible because I felt strong and confident and had a clear head. I did more than 70 radio and television interviews over the course of that week. It was exhausting, but, along with my amazing cohorts in Reclaim, we changed the conversations about women’s safety in the UK and the world. The work continues. In January, we will be back in the high court to try to have our human right to protest, regardless of lockdown restrictions, argued into law. We have become a women’s safety campaign group and are offering consent workshops with the social enterprise Shout Out UK. We are working on legislation and education reforms for women’s safety. In June, I went home to Philadelphia for the first time in three years. But I went back a changed woman; I had discovered who I was. I don’t believe everyone needs to burn their life to the ground to start again. But making little changes and addressing dependency issues can unleash happiness that you no longer thought was possible. It isn’t only about avoiding snacks or a second glass of wine. What really changed my relationship with food and my body was cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). A daily stack of decisions, starting with a sports bra on a door knob every day, has made my old lifestyle unrecognisable. But the most revolutionary change is that I now want to spend time in my own company (well, with my dog, McNulty). After a full MOT on my body recently, I learned that I had added a decade to my life expectancy. My metabolic age was 49 in October 2020. It is now 39. I am Benjamin Buttoning my life. I still miss my mom daily – the grief is still there – but it is counterbalanced by so much more. I still have work to do, but the results of the work I have done make getting up so much easier than I ever believed possible.

12/31/2021,"Britons’ annual spending on ethical products and investments has surpassed £100bn for the first time, as lifestyle changes linked to Covid and the climate crisis stoked demand for plant-based foods, secondhand clothes and furniture, and greener gadgets. The value of the “green” pound surged by nearly a quarter to £122bn in 2020, according to a new Co-op report covering the most recent year for which figures are available. That total was bolstered by £57bn of ethical savings and investments.  Shoppers spent £61bn on ethical products and services, which was nearly 30% more than in 2019. That equates to £2,189 a household, a £489 increase. The equivalent figure for 2010 was £1,028. The retailer’s ethical consumerism report, which is a barometer of the extent to which consumers’ shopping habits reflect their concerns about the environment, animal welfare and social justice, also found more shoppers were boycotting brands on ethical or social concerns. These businesses suffered a £3.9bn loss of sales, which was £600m bigger than the previous year. Steve Murrells, the Co-op’s chief executive, said shoppers were “turning up the heat” to get companies to change. The boycotts were a “warning to brands that they must do business in a better way for workers, communities and the planet”, he said. The huge increase in ethical spending also showed that when businesses provide choice, and the government offers helpful incentives, “consumers will respond positively”, Murrells added. The area of the market that saw the biggest increase was eco-travel and transport, where sales rose by more than 70% to £12.2bn. This reflected the rise in electric car ownership as well as the impact of the pandemic, which revived cycling to levels last seen in Britain in the 1960s. Britons are also trying to make their homes greener by investing in energy-efficient boilers as well as other household appliances or switching to “green” electricity deals. Taken together this market had expanded by a third to be worth £20.5bn. However, this push fell short of what is needed to hit the government’s net zero targets, the Co-op said. For example, while households spent £5bn on energy-efficient gas boilers, just £130m went on heat pumps. The report also highlighted the growing appetite to buy secondhand goods, be it for financial or environmental reasons. Sales of secondhand clothes increased by nearly a quarter to £864m while spending on “pre-loved” furniture was up by more than £100m at £837m. In the now £14bn ethical food and drink market the sales trends reflect people making changes to their diet, with demand for vegetarian and plant-based foods up 34% at £1.5bn. Fairtrade and organic food also grew strongly, up 14% and 13% respectively, while free-range egg sales exceeded £1bn for the first time.",Lifestyle/Money,UK annual spending on ethical products surpasses £100bn for first time,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/dec/31/uk-annual-spending-on-ethical-products-surpasses-100bn-for-first-time
12/31/2021,"Only a quarter of the government officials responsible for cancelling HS2 to Yorkshire and downgrading plans for Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR) actually live in the north of England and rely on the region’s sub-par trains, the Guardian has learned. Of the 24 officials in the Department for Transport (DfT) responsible for writing the Integrated Rail Plan (IRP), just six live in the north, the DfT admitted in response to a freedom of information (FoI) request.  The government was accused of “betraying” the north in November, when the long-awaited IRP ignored recommendations from Transport for the North, a statutory body set up to advise the government on the region’s transport needs. That organisation, which brings together all the political and business leaders of the north, had asked for HS2 to reach Leeds and for NPR to run right across the country, including a stop in Bradford. Steve Rotheram, the mayor of the Liverpool city region, said: “With so few northern voices involved in the decision-making process, it’s no surprise that the government chose to ignore millions of people across the north in foisting their cheap and nasty rail plan on us. It’s the same old ‘Whitehall knows best’ thinking that we have seen time and time again from a government who are doing more to hold us back than level us up.” Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, said the admissions were proof the “cut-price” IRP was plotted from Whitehall and imposed on the rest of the country. “You don’t have to spend long travelling on the north’s fragmented, unreliable, overpriced public transport system to realise that it has been built by people who don’t live here and don’t use it,” he said. “Transport for the North was set up to correct this and give the north a strong transport voice. It’s so frustrating that its clear, united, cross-party advice on the IRP was simply ignored. The result is yet another cut-price plan imposed by Whitehall that will not solve our rail needs. We will only get the public transport that people in the north deserve when we are able to make our own decisions about it.” The rail plans caused particular anger in the north-east, with local business leaders accusing the government of “ignoring” the region of 2.7 million people. Jamie Driscoll, the North of Tyne mayor, said the FoI admissions proved the north of England needed to be able to make its own decisions. “If anyone in the north ever believed this government was serious about investing in northern transport, they don’t now. The only way we’ll ever see a decent northern transport network is to give the north the power to raise the finance ourselves. That means devolving the transport budget. We’re nearly a quarter of the country’s population – give us a quarter of the budget, and let us decide how to spend it. And give us tools like land value capture, so we can create the wealth to pay for vital infrastructure,” he said. The DfT said that one of the two ministers in the “core” IRP team lived in the north. It did not name them, but it is very likely to have been Andrew Stephenson, the minister for HS2 and MP for Pendle in Lancashire. The department refused to reveal how many of the DfT’s three special advisers involved in the IRP lived in the north because it “would be unfair and would contravene current data protection legislation”. In March 2021 the government announced the DfT was to create a “second headquarters” in Birmingham and a northern hub in Leeds, with 650 job roles created in the two cities by 2025.",News/UK news,Majority of officials who downgraded northern rail plans don’t live there,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/31/majority-of-officials-who-downgraded-northern-rail-plans-dont-live-there
12/31/2021,"In recent years, Michael has come to regard the United States, the nation of which he has been a citizen all his life, as an abusive parent. “I can acknowledge my past association with that person while at the same time wanting to keep future association to a minimum,” he said.  Michael – the name is false as he requested anonymity to avoid being inundated with hate mail – found his disaffection with his native country reach crunch point in 2020. The chaotic end of the Donald Trump era combined with the inequities exposed by the Covid pandemic made him despair of being an American. “Coronavirus made me realize that in the US, if you’re not a member of the moneyed elite you’re left to fend for yourself with virtually no help from the federal government,” he said. “The farcical presidential campaign made me realize that I don’t want to be a member of a society in which my vote is made irrelevant by gerrymandering or the electoral college.” And so Michael decided to renounce his US citizenship. Having moved to Finland 10 years ago, he would break the ties that officially bound him to a country whose values he no longer recognised. That’s when Michael’s troubles really began. He discovered that along with thousands of other US citizens living abroad, he was caught in a Kafkaesque trap. For almost two years, since the pandemic struck in March 2020, most US consular missions around the world have suspended their expatriation services for those wishing to give up US citizenship. The US embassy in London, the largest of its sort in western Europe, announces on its website that it is “currently unable to accept appointments for loss of nationality applications” and is unable to say when services will resume. The US state department says giving up citizenship requires a face-to-face interview with a government official, and that it is too risky given coronavirus. Delays have led to a growing mountain of disgruntled citizens. By some calculations, there may be as many as 30,000 people among the 9 million US citizens living abroad who would like to begin the renunciation process but can’t. Joshua Grant is one of them. He was born and raised in Selma, Alabama, until he moved to Germany when he was 21 to learn the language. He has been there ever since. He lives in Lower Saxony and married a German citizen last year. Grant, 30, feels ready to acquire German citizenship, but under German law he must let go of his US passport. Easier said than done. He submitted a pile of paperwork to the US embassy in July 2020. Nothing has happened. He has written emails to the embassy staff, with no reply. He contacted the office of US senator from Alabama Richard Shelby. They passed him on to the state department, which in turn passed him back to the bureau of consular affairs, which mentioned the pandemic. “It’s very taxing. My whole life in Germany is on hold,” he said. “It’s funny: people in Germany tend to see the US as a liberal country where the rule of law was established, but I can’t even find anyone in the US government to talk to.” Nine US citizens abroad who have found themselves unable to give up their nationality are now suing the state department in a federal court in Washington. The suit, brought on the plaintiffs’ behalf by the French-based group Association of Accidental Americans, likens the situation to feudal times. “The US appears intent on preventing its citizens from exercising their natural and fundamental right to voluntarily renounce their citizenship,” it says. Some people want to give up US citizenship because the government has been making the burden of being an American more onerous for those abroad. In 2010 the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) was passed, requiring foreign banks and other financial institutions to report on any clients they suspect of being American to the IRS. The US is also one of only two countries (the other is Eritrea) that tax people on their citizenship rather than where they live. That forces Americans abroad to declare their global income to the IRS, with possible tax implications. The impact of these burdens is reflected in the number of people who renounce each year. Between 2000 and 2010 it remained relatively steady at less than 1,000 people, but after FATCA came in, the numbers rose sharply to a peak last year of almost 7,000. Some of the would-be renouncers are “accidental Americans”, having acquired citizenship because they were born in the US though they have lived elsewhere all their lives. That label could be applied to the UK prime minister Boris Johnson, who was born in New York but has not lived in the US since he was five. Johnson renounced his citizenship in 2017, having said he was outraged a few years earlier by having to pay the US tax authorities for gains on the sale of his London home. Marie Sock, the first woman to stand as a presidential candidate in the Gambia, was forced to pull out of the race recently after she failed to get any response to her request to renounce her US nationality from the US embassy. She explained in a video posted on Facebook that under Gambia election law, presidential candidates must be sole Gambian nationals. James – also not his real name – was born in Texas but has not lived in the US since he was four. He now lives in Singapore. He became disillusioned when he learned that because his son was born outside the US he would not be eligible for US citizenship, and yet because of James’s citizenship he would treated as if he were a US taxpayer. That struck him as a modern form of taxation without representation. “The double standards really annoy me,” he said. For the past year he has been trying to get through to an official who will help him renounce his citizenship, without success. “I never asked for US citizenship, and now I’m not even allowed to give it up.”",News/US news,Americans seeking to renounce their citizenship are stuck with it for now,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/31/americans-seeking-renounce-citizenship-stuck

PHNetflix, available now For the last couple of decades, it has felt as if graffiti artist Banksy has been simultaneously everywhere and nowhere: a constant ambient presence in British life, but also an absence where detail should be. Wisely, Aurélia Rouvier and Seamus Haley’s documentary largely steers clear of the endless speculation about Banksy’s actual identity and instead asks what Banksy is, how Banksy works and why anyone should care. It’s probably the only realistic approach to an artist who continues to both loom large and elude categorisation. PHBritBox, available now There is something undeniably odd about the idea of a former couple deciding to go on television to openly discuss the reasons their relationship ended. But this show has now reached season four so it is clearly an itch people are wanting to scratch. This new series begins with three former couples: Flame and Alex, Jade and Higor, and Jack and Indigo. What will their televised therapy sessions over meals reveal? Issues discussed include text dumpings, emotional inarticulacy and, of course, the corrupting effects of social media. PHBBC Three, from Sunday 2 January Textbook telenovela cheese from Netflix, which begins the year with this trashy, soapy melodrama set in a high school in Mexico – although it’s a remake of an Argentinian show from the early 00s. The story follows a new group of students who are bonding, hooking up and preparing for a Battle of the Bands contest while contending with various elaborate hazing rituals from a shady group known as The Lodge. No cliche goes unexploited and no heartstring goes untugged, but it’s undemanding and potentially addictive – especially at a time of year when guiltily bingeing is all too easy to fall into. PHNetflix, from Wednesday 5 January Based on Cece Bell’s New York Times bestseller and Newbery Honour-winning graphic novel memoir, here is a charming three-part animation about a girl who loses her hearing and finds her inner superhero – El Deafo. Conscious about wearing a hearing aid on her chest at school, Cece (voiced by newcomer Lexi Finigan) quickly embraces her “super powers” – such as being able to use her aid to detect when the teacher is on her way back from the loo (she picks up the flush). Sweet, funny, poignant and definitely not just for kids. HRApple TV+, from Friday 7 January For anyone who is not on TikTok (basically, if you are over the age of 25) you’re going to first need an education on what the Hype House is: a gen Z collective of the social media platform’s creators established in 2019 and based in a bizarre, collaborative LA mansion. Netflix has now given the group the documentary treatment, promising to show the gory details of life as an influencer and their relationships with each other. Considering every moment of their lives is already shared with millions, is it even possible to get any closer? If you can bear it, tune in to find out. HRNetflix, from Friday 7 January A gritty Polish legal drama selected by the Walter Presents arm, with Magdalena Cielecka starring as lawyer Joanna Chylka in the second season. As we rejoin Chylka, the nation is scandalised by the arrest of the son of Piotr Langer Sr, a successful businessman. Langer Jr is the heir to a massive fortune but also stands accused of a brutal double murder. Chylka finds herself defending the younger man, which is unfortunate as his dad has decided to publicly cut ties. Chylka smells a rat but Langer Jr seems oddly unwilling to try to defend himself.

12/31/2021,"The death of a young woman in Sierra Leone, almost immediately after undergoing female genital mutilation, has sparked outrage and revived calls to end the practice. The body of 21-year-old Maseray Sei was found on 20 December at Nyandeni village in Bonthe district, southern Sierra Leone, a day after the FGM took place. Sei’s family said that after the procedure the mother of two boys complained of a migraine and was in pain, with complications from FGM thought to be the cause, according to activists working on the case.  The family are now pressing for a postmortem. Sei’s body was found in a “Bondo bush”, the enclosure of a house belonging to the centuries-old secret women’s Bondo society, common across largely rural Sierra Leone, where FGM often takes place. Sierra Leone has one of the highest rates of FGM in the world, with nine out of 10 women and girls aged between 15 and 49 affected, according to Unicef. Despite restrictions on secret societies since the Ebola outbreak in 2014, and particularly on their initiation rites, of which FGM is often a part, the practice remains legal in Sierra Leone, with politicians accused of making statements backing FGM and of funding Bondo houses. The societies are important cultural institutions, rooted in ancient rituals believed to protect communities against evil and guide adolescent girls to womanhood. After Sei’s death, police arrested a number of soweis – senior society members who do the cutting in FGM – as well as a village chief in the Bonthe district, responsible for regulating the secret societies. Rugiatu Turay, an activist and former deputy minister for gender in Sierra Leone, said the case was another shocking example of the toll of FGM on women. “It’s a tragic case and, in a way, shows how many more people like her have died or are suffering, because the majority of cases are unreported,” she said. Turay chairs a coalition of 21 national groups fighting FGM which is now putting pressure on the authorities to carry out the postmortem. “It’s the next important step for us to get clarity in this case,” she said. Senesie Amara, an activist working with Sei’s family, said relatives reported she was in good health the day before the FGM. “She went to fetch wood and water for her aunt, she was physically fine on 18 December. That night she slept at the Bondo house, and that was when things got bad,” Amara said. “For the family, it’s very shocking. They loved her.” Sei was the mother of a four-year-old and a six-month-old baby, and was still in secondary education due to starting school late and repeating numerous years, Amara said, describing how despite her challenges she fought for a better life for herself and her sons. But community pressure to undergo FGM increased after she had her second child. “She went to her uncle on the 11th of this month, and told him she wanted to join the Bondo society. He said he didn’t have money to give her, he was working on refurbishing their family house. She then went to her boyfriend. He gave her 200,000 leone [£13],” Amara said. Bondo societies have seen many changes, Turay said, yet FGM remains a central and dangerous practice. “While in government I pushed for Sierra Leone to have a national strategy for ending FGM but this was resisted,” she said. “Over the years a lot of things have changed within the Bondo culture, and our organisation looks at how we can build on the better aspects of our culture, wherein women can be trained and empowered.” After Sei’s death, videos on social media showing political figures in Sierra Leone promising to protect FGM practices have been condemned by activists. The gender equality charity, Equality Now, said last week: “We strongly condemn the actions of politicians supporting FGM and urge the government to prosecute all offenders putting women and girls at risk.”",News/Global development,Death of young woman after FGM revives calls for ban in Sierra Leone,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/dec/31/death-of-young-woman-after-fgm-revives-calls-for-ban-in-sierra-leone
