12/30/2021,"Just before Thomas Randele died, his wife of nearly 40 years asked his golfing buddies and his co-workers from the dealerships where he sold cars to come by their home. They gathered to say goodbye to a guy they called one of the nicest people they’d ever known — a devoted family man who gushed about his daughter, a golfer who never bent the rules, a friend to so many that a line stretched outside the funeral home a week later. By the time of their final visit last May at Randele’s house in suburban Boston, the cancer in his lungs had taken away his voice. So they all left without knowing that their friend they’d spent countless hours swapping stories with never told them his biggest secret of all. For the past 50 years, he was a fugitive wanted in one of the largest bank robberies in Cleveland’s history, living in Boston under a new name he created six months after the heist in the summer of 1969. Not even his wife or daughter knew until he told them in what authorities described as a deathbed confession. How he was able to leave behind one family and create a new life — while evading a father and son from the U.S. Marshals Service who never gave up their hunt — is just now being pieced together. ___ Ted Conrad quickly figured out that security was fairly loose at the Society National Bank in Cleveland after he started as a teller in January 1969. He told his buddies, “It’d be so easy for me to walk out with all kinds of money,” Russell Metcalf, his best friend from high school, said in an interview with The Associated Press. They thought he was blowing smoke when he brought it up a few more times. Then just a day after his 20th birthday that July, Conrad walked out at closing time on a Friday with a paper bag stuffed with $215,000 from the vault, a haul worth $1.6 million today. By the time the missing money was noticed the following Monday, Conrad was flying across the country. Letters sent to his girlfriend showed he made stops in Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles within the first week. In one letter, he mistakenly thought he could return in seven years when the statute of limitations expired. But once he was indicted, that was no longer true. Conrad apparently cut off contact with his entire family, including three siblings and his parents, who were divorced. Some family members eventually presumed he was dead because so many years had passed, said Matt Boettger, whose mother was Conrad's older sister. His mom, he said, was relieved more than anything to find out her brother had lived a happy life. “She thought she would go to her grave and never know,” he said. ___ The bank heist in 1969 didn’t capture the attention of the nation, or even the city of Cleveland. Everyone else was focused on Apollo 11′s historic flight to the moon that week. But for John Elliott, a deputy U.S. marshal, it was personal. He and Conrad came from the same side of town. Elliott used to take his family to the ice cream shop where Conrad worked. They shared a doctor. The problem was that Conrad's head start allowed him to disappear, and he was disciplined enough not to make any missteps. The last credible sighting came in October 1969, when a Cleveland couple visiting Hawaii met a man they later realized looked very much like Conrad. Elliott traveled across the U.S. looking for Conrad and even after retiring in 1990 he would come in the office just about every week and pore over the files, said his son, Pete Elliott, now the top U.S. marshal in Cleveland, who inherited the hunt for Conrad nearly 20 years ago. His father died in March 2020 before investigators pieced together details from Randele's obituary and signatures from his past. Then in November, Randele's family confirmed that just before he died he told them his real identity and what he had done, Elliott said. “It always stayed on my dad’s mind,” he said. “We kept this case going because it was important to my father.” ___ Why Conrad committed the robbery has been analyzed endlessly. “It wasn’t about the money. He always wanted to impress people,” said Metcalf, his high school pal, who remembered how Conrad once stole a deck of cards just to prove he could. “He had no fear.” Investigators believe he was inspired by the 1968 movie “The Thomas Crown Affair,” about a bank executive who got away with $2.6 million and turned the heist into a game. Conrad saw the film at least six times and copied Steve McQueen’s character, driving sports cars and drinking high-end liquor, according to friends. After the real-life robbery in Cleveland, Conrad wound up in the Boston area, where much of the movie was filmed. It's a good possibility that he chose his new first name “Thomas” based on the movie, Elliott said. “He modeled his whole life after the movie,” he said. ___ The man known as Thomas Randele came into existence the first week of January in 1970, investigators have found in recent weeks. That’s when Conrad walked into a Social Security Administration office in Boston, asked for an identification number under his new name and made himself two years older, Elliott said. At that time, it wasn’t unusual to wait until you were an adult, so his application didn’t raise any red flags. With a new identification card, he was able to open a bank account, build credit and create his new life, Elliott said. During the 1970s, Randele worked as an assistant golf pro, giving lessons at a country club outside Boston and later becoming its manager. He spent a few winters golfing in Florida, according to his obituary. He also met his future wife not long after arriving in Boston. They were married in 1982. Around then he began working in the car business, selling Land Rovers and Volvos at a handful of dealerships until he retired after nearly 40 years. It was a job that put him in front of dozens of strangers every day. What’s not clear yet is what happened to the money. The Marshals Service is looking into whether he lost it early on through bad investments. While Randele and his wife, Kathy, lived most of their years in a pleasant Boston suburb, they filed for bankruptcy protection in 2014. Court records showed they then owed $160,000 in credit card debt and had few assets. His wife told Cleveland.com in November that her husband was a great man and that she was still grieving. She has declined interview requests. ___ No one would have guessed that Randele, who was 71 when he died, was someone trying to hide from authorities. Among the many people he became friends with over the years was an FBI agent in Boston, Elliott said. He never shied away from anyone on the golf course or in the auto showrooms where he'd keep a set of clubs and swing his 7-iron when sales were slow. “He was just a gentle soul, you know, very polite, very well spoken,” said Jerry Healy, who first met Randele at a Woburn, Massachusetts, dealership where they talked daily for years. The two were among a group five or six car salesmen who stuck together for much of their careers. None of them, Healy said, ever suspected something like this in Randele's past. “It never dawned on us, and that’s a half a dozen guys that aren’t easy to fool,” he said. His former co-workers said they never heard Randele say a bad word about anybody or raise his voice. They all said he was the best golfer they ever knew. Everyone wanted him on their side when there was a tournament. He wasn't much of a drinker and never put down any side bets while playing, said Bob Van Wert, who first met Randele while golfing and then later worked with him. They remembered he could always control his emotions and rarely got upset, even on the course, where he had such a pretty swing that he once bested Hall of Fame golfer Johnny Miller at a charity event, his former boss remembered. Matt Kaplan, who managed two dealerships where Randele worked and golfed with him every Sunday morning for many years, called him the definition of a gentleman. “The only way it makes sense is that at that age he was just a kid, and it was a challenge kind of thing,” Kaplan said. “It’s not like he became a professional bank robber."" ""If he would have told us way back when, I don’t think we would have believed him because he wasn’t that kind of guy,” he said. “The man was different than the kid.” ___ In the early days after Randele's identity was revealed, his friends couldn't believe it. But now looking back, there are a few things that make sense. How he always had a beard. The photos of him wearing dark sunglasses on the golf course. His reluctance to talk about where he grew up or his extended family. “You know all the years I knew Tommy, I never heard him mention a sister or a mother or a brother or a father. Everything was kind of generalized,” Healy said. “You could never pry anything from him,” said Brad Anthony, another close friend. “I figured maybe he had a bad childhood and he didn’t want to talk about it.” Still, he said it's almost impossible to believe. “It just seems so out of character for the Tom I knew,” he said. All of his friends agreed that what happened long ago hasn't changed how they feel about him. “The man I knew didn’t change all of a sudden because of something he did a lifetime ago,” Healy said. “He was a good man, he was my friend and I think no less of him today than I did before this all came out. And I’d love to go play a round of golf with him.”",U.S./Associated Press,"Friendly family man's 50-year secret: He was fugitive, too",https://news.yahoo.com/friendly-family-mans-50-secret-122110124.html
12/30/2021,"WASHINGTON - Fareha Ahmed had been cautious since the beginning of the pandemic. She had eaten in restaurants only three times. She and her husband were vaccinated and boosted, and their 7-year-old got vaccinated in November as soon as he was eligible. In mid-December, Ahmed, 39, who lives in Washington, D.C., met a former colleague for an outdoor lunch. A few days later, the family attended an indoor gathering for the first time with other families, to bake Christmas cookies. Then covid caught up with her. Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post. Two days after the lunch, the colleague tested positive for coronavirus. Ahmed took PCR and rapid tests - both negative - and then for good measure took another PCR test the day of the cookie party; the other participants told her to come over and not worry. But three days after the party she started feeling ill, and the next day her PCR test came back positive. ""Like garbage,"" was how she felt when she saw the result, which came shortly before Christmas. ""Like my stomach basically was in my throat . . . like I'd just ruined everybody's Christmas, including my own family's."" Across the nation and the world, people who thought they knew how to avoid covid are getting a rude surprise. Safety precautions that had for so long felt talismanic ― get vaccinated, mask up, avoid large indoor gatherings - have in the past week or two collapsed under the weight of omicron, a much more highly transmissible variant than the ones before it. Schools and colleges returned to virtual learning. Flights were canceled as airline staff caught the virus. Long-anticipated holiday plans fell apart as people - young and old, vaccinated and unvaccinated - tested positive right and left. Those with negative tests worried it was only a matter of time. They are likely right, according to Robert Frenck, professor of pediatrics and director of the Vaccine Research Center at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital. ""You know what? You're probably going to get covid, but it's OK,"" he said. Instead of thinking they lost the race against the virus, Frenck encouraged people to redefine their concept of winning. ""It's not that you failed,"" he said. ""You actually succeeded. You dodged the bullet. . . . What are people trying to prevent? Are we trying to prevent the common cold? Nobody's going to do that. You've gotten your booster, you've done everything, and you still get covid, but how sick did you get?"" For most infected people with vaccines, he said, ""What they're having is a cold."" People misunderstand what the vaccine is designed to do, Frenck said, adding that unvaccinated people are dying at a rate 20 times higher than people who are vaccinated and boosted. ""Vaccines are going to stop people from being hospitalized and from ending up in the ICU and from dying,"" he said. ""This is nature saying, it hasn't gone away now, and we need to go out and get vaccinated."" But even if people are not feeling very sick, it can be hard to come to terms with a positive result after all the time and effort spent keeping the virus at bay. The pandemic's long and continuing arc has made it harder for people to process it, said Ilene Weingarten, a marriage and family therapist in Los Angeles who has seen patients sobbing over omicron, whether or not they've been exposed to it. ""It's the relentlessness of it,"" she said. ""We're still absorbing the shock of March 2020, but we're still in it. The normal trajectory of a trauma that resolves is you go through it, you may repeat it over and over in your head, and that aspect fades after time and then ultimately it get metabolized into your system. . . . But if it doesn't, it's trapped in your nervous system and you're reacting to it all the time."" The narrowing of people's lives over the past two years contributes to a more depressive outlook, Weingarten said. ""You don't see the world in a wide way, you don't see context,"" she said. ""It has an immense mental health toll, immense; with omicron in particular, there's been a spike in disheartened feelings, feelings of hopelessness and helplessness."" Adults 40 and under are having an especially difficult time, Weingarten said. ""Everyone's disheartened, but I think it's hit millennials harder,"" she said, noting that that generation's adulthood has been marked by 9/11, the Great Recession and now covid. ""You already feel like you were sold a bill of goods, like, 'I did all the right things and now this.' There's a sense that there's no end to the misery."" Some who are now getting covid feel resentful toward those who have resisted vaccines and other safety protocols. Tatiana Laborde, 36, of Washington, said her family was careful to limit interactions during the pandemic. They raced to get the vaccine when it came out and got their children, now 8 and 6, vaccinated as soon as they were eligible. But several days before Christmas, her older son tested positive, and after a few negative tests Laborde and her husband tested positive Sunday. She thinks her son picked it up at school, where there had been an exposure. Her son and husband have experienced mild flu-like symptoms; Laborde felt more run-down and couldn't sleep for a couple of nights. She said the positive test results made her feel ""defeated."" ""I know we're going to be fine, I know we're not going to the hospital,"" she said. ""It's just that thing where we've been so careful, and not everyone in the country takes it seriously, so there's that anger."" When Ahmed learned she was positive, she felt a surge of dread. She texted everyone else who had been at the cookie party - six adults and four kids - to let them know they had been exposed. ""They said, 'Look, it's not your fault, don't blame yourself,' "" she said. ""But I said, 'If you test positive, it's my fault.' "" Their tests all came back negative. Ahmed's symptoms have been up and down: she has felt tired with a mild sore throat, chest pressure, and intermittent headaches and body aches. She has been sleeping in the basement, isolated from her husband and two children. All have been wearing masks around the house, and they canceled Christmas at her in-laws' in West Virginia. Their neighbors are in a similar situation. In this latest wave, it seems everyone knows someone who has tested positive. The timing of omicron has felt especially cruel, spreading across the country just as boosters became widely available and families prepared for holiday gatherings. In fact, boosters had made some feel they could finally ease up on their precautions. Jo McDaniel, 40, says she was ""hypervigilant,"" testing weekly as she and her wife prepared to open a new bar near their house in Washington. As omicron ramped up, they started testing more often. Even after being fully vaccinated, they had barely gone anywhere without masks. But after receiving their boosters, they attended a few networking events and ate dinner out unmasked. ""It felt a little bit freeing . . . that felt kind of awesome,"" McDaniel said. A week before Christmas, her wife tested positive. She was mostly asymptomatic. But McDaniel said she felt duped. ""We were starting to sense some sense of normal, and then got lax, being around people we didn't know or who weren't in our pod,"" McDaniel said. ""We felt this sense of security to safely do that . . . the sense of hope that the vaccine and booster was going to keep us safe. Now I feel like a real fool. I feel like we let our guard down prematurely because we wanted it to be over, we wanted to hug people."" That is understandable, Frenck of the Cincinnati Children's Hospital said, adding that people can only live with heightened awareness for so long. ""Either they let their guard down or their systems go haywire,"" he said. ""They can't tolerate it anymore, they're done. The world is done. We're interactive people, we're social creatures; we want to be around other people."" With vaccines and boosters, most people can follow that instinct despite omicron, he said. Vaccinated people who are upset about getting mild cases now are ""operating on an emotional level rather than a rational level. The curves of hospitalization and deaths of people who have been vaccinated are basically flat."" Still, for many, getting the virus was a harsh reminder that life is still not back to normal. McDaniel and her wife canceled their plans to go home to Ohio for the holidays. ""I think we'll go back to vigilance in terms of going out as little as possible . . . ordering takeout,"" she said. Ahmed and her husband and kids had a quiet holiday at home. ""At first I was like, 'I ruined Christmas,' "" she said. ""But then I was like, 'No, we're going to have a different Christmas this year.'
