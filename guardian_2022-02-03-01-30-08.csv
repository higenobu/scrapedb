2/3/2022,"Steve Hitchen has resigned from his scouting and recruitment post at Tottenham and is under consideration for a similar role at Everton, who are restructuring under the new manager, Frank Lampard. Hitchen had been marginalised on the recruitment side at Spurs since the appointment of Fabio Paratici as the managing director of football last summer and, having considered his position for a number of months, he has decided to move on. The 45-year-old met the chairman, Daniel Levy, on Tuesday to ask to be released from his contract.  Everton, who are in the throes of a chaotic season, have been operating without a director of football, head of recruitment and manager of scouting after the respective departures of Marcel Brands, Grétar Steinsson and Dan Purdy were announced in early December. Newcastle also have an interest in Hitchen as they, too, look to reshape their recruitment operation. Hitchen, a former player at Blackburn, Macclesfield and Bangor City, went to Spurs as the chief scout in February 2017, having worked at the club between 2005-2010, initially as a European scout based in France and then in a more international role. Hitchen returned to Spurs as they regrouped after the resignation of the head of recruitment, Paul Mitchell, who was working a notice period. Hitchen would be promoted in September 2020 to the role of technical performance director, which the club said would have “responsibility for scouting, performance and recruitment analysis and youth recruitment”. Despite being friends, Hitchen and Paratici felt like an odd combination in the sense that their most important job was the same – to buy and sell first-team players. The Guardian understands that Hitchen had little involvement in the transfer window last summer and again in January, and was focused more on overseeing departments such as sports science and medical. Hitchen’s watch will show more misses than hits on the market, with the former headlined by Tanguy Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso in the summer of 2019 at a combined and eventual cost of about £115m. They were loaned on Monday to Lyon and Villarreal respectively. The midfielders were signed for the manager at the time, Mauricio Pochettino, but he would leave in November of that year. Neither Ndombele nor Lo Celso has been a fit for the subsequent managers and the churn from Pochettino to José Mourinho to Nuno Espírito Santo via Ryan Mason to Antonio Conte has been challenging for everybody at the club, including Hitchen. The most successful signings of Hitchen’s time in charge of recruitment will go down as Lucas Moura from Paris Saint-Germain in January 2018 for £25m and Pierre-Emile Højbjerg from Southampton in the summer of 2020 for £15m. Hitchen went to Liverpool after his first spell at Spurs, where he was instrumental in the signing of Luis Suárez in January 2011. He then worked in senior recruitment positions at Queens Park Rangers and Derby.",Sport/Football,Steve Hitchen quits Spurs recruitment role amid Everton interest,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/02/steve-hitchen-quits-spurs-recruitment-role-amid-everton-interest
2/3/2022,"It may have been dominating conversation in Westminster on Wednesday, but questions about levelling up were met with blank stares among shoppers on Wednesfield high street in Wolverhampton. Most had never heard of the concept, while of those who had, many doubted it would do much to improve their quality of life.  “Does levelling up just mean the whole country will be the same level of poor together?” said Gary Green, 56, who has worked on the street’s fruit and veg stall for 22 years. “Whatever we gain in levelling up, we’ll lose more with taxes going up, energy prices are devastating everybody. They are 100% out of touch. How can anyone make a living and survive when everything is going through the roof?” Just outside the city centre, Wednesfield sits in Wolverhampton North East, one of a number of former “red wall” seats that voted Conservative in the last general election. Green said he had “voted Conservative my whole life but I wouldn’t vote for them again”, adding that he doubted levelling up would do enough to cut through anger over the cost of living and the long-term economic impact of Covid. The city of Wolverhampton has been promoted by the government as a key beneficiary of its new strategy, and was one of the first areas to be prioritised for a share of a £1.5bn brownfield fund. It was home to the first new government HQ outside London, when the housing ministry opened a site there last year. “We want a government as focused on Wolverhampton as it is on Westminster,” proclaimed the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, on Wednesday morning before the publication of a white paper. Ian Brookfield, the Labour leader of Wolverhampton council, said: “It would be cheerless of me not to welcome it, we’ve been starved for so long. Of course I’m grateful for anything that we receive. But will it make up for the past 10 years of budget cuts? Probably not.” In Wednesfield, many shoppers were also sceptical about the real-world impact of the policy. Sharon Gunter, 55, a retail worker, said she knew little about the white paper and would “believe it when I see it happening”. “It’s a lot of talk. I’m very disheartened with things at the moment,” she said. “They’ll say they’re doing this [levelling up] to try to distract from what’s going on and make people forget about the parties scandal.” Others, although sketchy on the details, were more hopeful about the potential of the levelling up agenda to bring some needed investment to the area. “It sounds positive, I’m optimistic” said Adil Chutoo, 67, a nurse. “I feel they are trying to help. We need more investment around here, people are struggling. The traditional high street is gradually dying. The intentions are there; whether they become actions, we don’t know.” Kim Denny, 60, shopping with her mother, said: “You look around and things aren’t the same as they used to be. Shops are shutting, this used to be a lovely little vibrant town and it’s not like that any more. So I think levelling up sounds like a great idea, I just don’t know much about it.” Brookfield said he was not surprised that so many people knew little about what levelling up means. “This is infrastructure-led levelling up, it is not people-based. People doesn’t know what it means for them and just wave it away,” he said. “There’s going to be cataclysmic events later on this year with the energy crisis and cost of living. Of course we could do with a new building here and there, but its people who need looked after first.”",News/UK news,"Levelling up?

2/3/2022,"For nearly 30 years, Pink Narcissus was a film as mysterious as it is sensual and erotic. Clocking in at just over an hour, it was released in 1971 with an anonymous director, and skirted the obscenity laws. Artistic, radical, with a truly innovative cinematic palette, it remained unashamedly gay and pornographic. Shot on Super-8 and almost dialogue free, it builds a loose narrative around the dreams and fantasies a male sex worker has in his New York apartment between clients. He imagines himself a Spanish matador, a Roman slave, and among leather-clad bikers hanging around grimy toilets. As much as the acting, the sensuality of these scenes comes from the washes of scenographic colour: the bullfighter pulls up his high boots amid a variety of purple hues; the cottaging spot is a monochrome of black and grey; Narcissus is shown in a boudoir of burning pink. The climax comes when the sex worker – a mop of dark curly hair, high cheek bones – plays both a Middle Eastern potentate and his catamite, entertained by an increasingly energetic male belly dancer, the latter’s erection barely covered in a sheer veil.  In 1999, James Bidgood, who died on Monday aged 88, was revealed as the author of this underground classic. The director had fallen out with the producers over the final cut of the movie and, despite having spent six years making it, meticulously building the sets and filming the entire thing in his Hell’s Kitchen apartment, he demanded his name be removed. The film, he said, was a portrait of his own dreams as a young gay man in New York. “I’m addicted to dreaming,” he told Butt magazine in 2010. “If you mean getting lost in fantasies, ideas, hearing tunes, seeing rhyme couplets, cuz I’m workin’ on a musical, the whole schmear, book, music, lyrics. I win all sorts of awards dreaming. I’ve won the Tony and wept uncontrollably giving my thank you speech at least a dozen times in my imagination, usually in the bathtub.” The revelation that Bidgood was the author ended years of speculation, and put paid to rumours that Pink Narcissus was the secret project of either Andy Warhol or Kenneth Anger. The former had released Blow Job in 1964, a 34-minute silent flick concentrating on the face of the lucky receiver; Anger’s biker fetish film Scorpio Rising had been released the year before. Both films revelled in erotica yet neither reached the same level of kitsch flamboyance as Bidgood. The director had been in New York for two decades when Pink Narcissus was released. Born in Wisconsin in 1933, at the height of the Great Depression, his first cinematic obsession was the Ziegfeld Follies, a series of song and dance extravaganzas. When he left home aged 18 he found that: “New York was exactly as it appeared to be in MGM musicals. It was fast and it was more exciting than your second orgasm.” He turned to drag, making his own costumes and debuting as “Terri How” at Club 82, a basement cabaret frequented by the mafia as much as the underground gay scene. “When I made my entrance, all dolled up in glitter and soft, fat ostrich feathers, I imagined I was working the boards at the Ziegfeld theatre,” Bidgood told Another Man in 2019. He was tasked with mixing with the clientele, encouraging them to buy more drinks, and the pay got him into Parsons School of Design where he honed his costumer skills. Soon he was able to make a living making dresses for society balls, giving him maximum freedom in his art. His photographic style seemed to be fully formed from the start: young men with boyish looks, smooth chests and pert bottoms posed on a variety of mythological and fantastical stage sets. The photography series Apache (1964–66) shows a lad leaning on a lamp-post against a fairground background. The deity Pan sits demurely on a tree trunk in Pan from Behind (1965-1969); Jack Frost, in nothing but a jockstrap and glitter spray, is tied to a giant snowflake. The August/September 1965 issue of Muscleboy, one of the “fitness magazines” then skirting the obscene-material laws, featured a cover image by Bidgood: a young man reclining in an undergrowth clearly constructed with old green and blue scrunched up textile. A year earlier, Young Physique, another such title, had a brunette in white furs and tall white leather boots. Bidgood said he was traumatised after losing control of Pink Narcissus. As the pornography laws in the US loosened, he filmed a hardcore orgy scene titled Baghdad, but the feature film it was intended for never got completed. Meanwhile his masterpiece inspired the likes of Pierre et Gilles and David LaChapelle, who enjoyed the fame and economic security that eluded him. Bidgood has also been cited by a younger generation of creatives, including singers Charli XCX and Olly Alexander, and his influence can be detected in the style of rapper Lil Nas X among others. He enjoyed a retrospective at the Museum of Sex in New York in 2019, a monograph published by Taschen, and a 2020 collaboration with designer Christian Louboutin. Nonetheless he remained until the end in the cramped apartment in which he made his work. “I’ve been stuck with my dreams for close to 80 years now, and I still have to worry whether I have the rent money every month,” he said in 2010. A fundraiser has been set up to meet the costs of his funeral.",Arts/Art and design,"‘Addicted to dreaming’: James Bidgood, the Pink Narcissus director who defined camp",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/02/james-bidgood-pink-narcissus-defined-camp
2/3/2022,"The past decade has not been kind to the British sketch show. It is so rarely seen on television, that, in purely televisual terms, you would be forgiven for thinking the form had died out with 00s mainstays, such as the landline, DVDs and outrageous misogyny masquerading as friendly and completely harmless conversation. But sketch comedy has thrived on the perimeters of mainstream culture. Social media teems with incredibly clever and inventive quickfire skits, while character-comedy acts have been responsible for some of the slickest and most entertaining material on the live circuit in recent years.  Finally, it seems, TV wants in – again. This week, BBC Three – newly revived as an actual on-air channel – has launched with a brand new series from Edinburgh fringe favourites Lazy Susan, AKA comics Freya Parker and Celeste Dring. And it’s not the only sketch show BBC Three has committed to: it has ordered a full series of Ellie and Natasia, following a 2019 pilot by comedians Ellie White (who happens to be the braying Princess Beatrice to Dring’s Princess Eugenie in the excellent royal sitcom spoof The Windsors) and Natasia Demetriou. That’s right: two female-led sketch shows on the same channel in the same year. Although all debate about womankind’s propensity for producing tenable comedy has officially been declared over, this fact is still relevant – largely because many of Lazy Susan’s most inspired sketches revolve around gender dynamics. Singing In Your Face sees the romantic tensions of vintage Hollywood movies get a very satisfying (and very minor) nudge into sexual harassment territory, and, in a recurring skit titled A French Woman In A Film (Written By A Man), the pair send up the liberated, vacantly eccentric lady trope with aplomb. Some of the series’ sketches – including those examples – are taken from the pair’s uproarious 2018 Edinburgh fringe show, Forgive Me, Mother!, which featured a running narrative arc about Parker’s fear of being murdered by an obsessive male fan. The TV iteration isn’t quite so direct, but themes of sexism and gender norms hover ambiently behind most sketches. And, just as those themes have had a modern revamp in recent years, so has comedy about them. “You’re skewering things but not in a way, from 10 years ago, where there’s a woman in a meeting and everyone’s talking over her,” says Dring. “Yes, that still happens but we know that in comedy now, so you don’t want to be making the same point.” Instead, it’s the more insidious aspects that seem most ripe for parody, such as how “skincare has replaced makeup as another standard of beauty, or clean eating replaced dieting”. In their musical parody Sleepy Girls, a dreamy, Lana Del Rey-esque number is used to home in on a contemporary, Insta-friendly sort of damsel in distress: the ideal of a woman who is “beautiful and waif-like and their main trait is that they have no agency”. Although the pair’s sketches frequently revolve around gender, this isn’t about pointing fingers, but, rather, spoofing the culture that has shaped all our brains. Yes, there is an element of resetting the power balance in some small way – “It’s always fun to play the men we’ve been subjected to, it feels quite cathartic,” says Dring – but part of the fun of parodying misogynistic tropes is acknowledging their own complicity. “I think a lot of women who grew up in the era I grew up in probably have quite a lot of internalised misogyny,” says Dring, who, like Parker, is in her early 30s. “I thought for ages, when I was a teenager, that I was one of the boys. When you realise that wasn’t that authentic, and take a step back, you’re like: that’s quite funny.” I’m speaking to Dring and Parker over Zoom: Dring is in the spare bedroom of her north London home (“for guests or when me and my boyfriend have an argument”); Parker is wearing a blond curly wig and having her makeup touched-up on the set of Wonka, the Willy Wonka origin story starring Timothée Chalamet, in which she plays a character called Miss Bon Bon (“real ‘blink and you’ll miss me’ vibes, but I’m very happy to be here”). The pair have been working together for a decade, but have also made a splash individually: as well as her recurring role in The Windsors, you may also recognise Dring as Kurtan’s love interest, Kayleigh, from This Country; Parker, meanwhile, played various characters in the news satire Late Night Mash, and also has a role in the upcoming Jurassic World sequel. As Lazy Susan – and their other work – makes abundantly clear, the pair are both extremely talented actors, far surpassing the usual sketch comedy standards. So it’s no surprise to discover they started out on the more straight-faced end of the spectrum. Parker was a jobbing actor (repeatedly cast as a child in theatre productions “because I’m small”), and Dring was in the post-university “wilderness years”, when they were introduced and quickly began making some “inexcusably bad” serious theatre. In one play they were two little boys whose father had left them. “It was like a reverse Waiting for Godot,” says Dring. “It died a death.” Soon after, comedy called. For one thing, it was more accessible – stage time was easier to come by and they could perform something they had written that day. “It seems like more of a meritocracy,” says Dring. “Dramatic acting feels like you need connections, you need to look a certain way.” Yet, on the other hand, comedy also seemed impenetrable – like magic, says Dring. “Or maths.” Growing up, she says, “I didn’t have any notion of how I could be funny. I saw sketch in that tradition of Monty Python and Fry and Laurie. Posh men doing wordplay, and I was like: what am I going to contribute to that?” The show sports an impressive roster of recognisable guest stars, including standups James Acaster and Lou Sanders, double Edinburgh award-winner John Kearns and Stath Lets Flats star Kiell Smith-Bynoe. Most are friends of the pair, who, nine years on from their Edinburgh fringe debut (they were nominated for the newcomer prize a year later in 2014) are well entrenched in the British comedy scene. Surely by now they are sketch experts, too? Not so, they insist. “If you said to me, you’ve got to write three sketches this week I would be like: ‘oh no!’” says Dring. “I honestly feel like, every time, we’re fumbling around in the dark – neither of us feel like we know what we’re doing. Not in a self-deprecating woman way – but that’s definitely part of it as well.” Parker laughs. “Please don’t let that be the headline: “I don’t know what I’m doing.” She pauses to view her, now visor-covered, face on her phone screen. “I look absolutely insane with this mask on.” New comedy is always divisive – particularly in the UK, and particularly in the everyone’s-a-critic social media age – but sketch shows, with their inevitable hit-and-miss nature, are especially so. The series even includes a sketch about a hotline that disgruntled viewers can use to vent at the pair (“if you don’t like our material, or you think we’re ugly and need to know!”). So, how are they preparing themselves for the reaction to Lazy Susan in real life? “I’ll put my full address on Twitter and I’m just going to let them come,” deadpans Parker. In fact, they say, the extreme, bile-filled “kill yourself” criticism is not the most painful. “I’m a massive perfectionist, so fair criticism is actually worse,” admits Dring. “I find it easier to tolerate people being like ‘I hope these sluts die,’ than someone that’s like ‘I feel like it lagged in the second half’. You’re like: ‘Owww, that’s really fair.’” So, if you really must criticise Lazy Susan’s inventive, ludicrous and sharply satirical sketches, then please ensure your grievances are as disturbing as possible.",Arts/Television & radio,"‘It’s fun to play the men we’ve been subjected to’: meet Lazy Susan, reinventors of the female sketch show",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/02/its-fun-to-play-the-men-weve-been-subjected-to-meet-lazy-susan-reinventors-of-the-female-sketch-show
2/3/2022,"Two of the first human patients to be treated with a revolutionary therapy that engineers immune cells to target specific types of cancer still possess cancer-killing cells a decade later with no sign of their illness returning. The finding suggests CAR T-cell therapy constitutes a “cure” for certain blood cancers, although adapting it to treat solid tumours is proving more challenging.  CAR – chimeric antigen receptor – T-cell therapy works by genetically engineering an individual’s T-cells to recognise and destroy cancer cells. T-cells are a type of white blood cell that can recognise and destroy foreign cells, including cancer cells, but because cancer is very good at evading immune detection, they often miss their mark. CAR T-cells are engineered to make them better at detecting cancer cells. In the UK the therapy is approved for use in children and young adults with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and adults with certain types of lymphoma – both are blood cancers. In trials, CAR-T therapy has been extraordinarily successful, putting patients into remission who had months to live, but the long-term effects had not been extensively studied. Now, Prof Carl June, at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, and colleagues report in Nature how cells from two of the first patients to be treated are faring 10 years on. Both patients were suffering from chronic lymphocytic leukaemia when they had CAR-T therapy in 2010, and achieved complete remission within months of treatment, meaning all signs and symptoms of their leukaemia disappeared. They remain cancer-free today. One of the patients, Doug Olson, said he had taken up running half-marathons after his treatment. When the researchers examined the patients’ blood, they could still identify CAR T-cells that were capable of proliferating and killing cancer cells, as well as others that help to shape immune responses. “We call these cells a living therapy, but it was a big surprise to us that they are still able to kill cancer cells 10 years after infusion,” June said. “We can’t say whether every last cancer cell was gone within three weeks [of treatment], or it could be that they keep coming up like whack-a-mole and then get killed, but we know that these [CAR T-cells] are on patrol. They persist and they are functional.” Prof Martin Pule, the director of the UCL Cancer Institute CAR T-cell programme, described the paper as a landmark. “A decade ago, CAR T-cell therapy was a therapeutic approach explored by a very small number of scientists and was considered a fringe approach and unlikely to work,” he said. “This paper shows us that CAR T-cells can give patients with cancers which no longer respond to chemotherapy remissions which last a decade.” Prof David Porter, of the University of Pennsylvania, who was involved in the research, said the team had been unprepared for how successful it would be. “Cancer doctors don’t use words like ‘cure’ lightly or, frankly, very often. But we now have patients like Doug who haven’t relapsed, and we really believe that we can start to use the word ‘cure’.” CAR-T therapy does not work for all patients or for all types of cancers. It is also labour-intensive and expensive, although June said the costs would come down. Pule said: “Solid cancers are harder to treat with CAR T-cells because they surround themselves with proteins and cells which shield them from the immune system. This is called the ‘tumour microenvironment’. We know that CAR T-cells can work well against solid cancer. For example, [we] have shown that they are active against solid cancers like neuroblastoma; however the CAR T-cells are overwhelmed by the microenvironment.” Second-generation T-cells, engineered to recognise the tumour and resist the microenvironment, are being tested in clinical trials, including one in leukaemia patients at UCL.",News/Society,First patients of pioneering CAR T-cell therapy ‘cured of cancer’,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/02/first-patients-pioneering-car-t-cell-therapy-cured-of-cancer
2/3/2022,"Pupils from an ultra-Orthodox Jewish boarding school near Paris have been taken into care after allegations they had been cut off from their families and subjected to years of abuse. Many of the children came from Israel and the US and spoke no French. One relative said parents thought they were sending their children abroad to a “Harry Potter school”.  The alarm was raised after a 15-year-old boy ran away from the Beth Yossef school at an isolated property in Bussières, a commune in Seine-et-Marne 37 miles (60km) east of Paris, in July and sought help from the US embassy. The boy claimed pupils were treated badly, served out-of-date food and sometimes deprived of meals. Other pupils ran away from the school, which offers boys over 12 a strict Orthodox education in Torah studies, at the end of last year. A number of young adults were also believed to be among the students at the establishment, described as “an extremely closed environment”. The public prosecutor Laureline Peyrefitte said the school was attended by “numerous undeclared American and Israeli minors who did not speak French”, isolating them further. The rescued children told of “being locked up, having their identity documents confiscated, living in poor conditions, acts of abuse, lack of access to education and healthcare and with no possibility of returning to their families,” she said. On Monday police raided the school and arrested 16 teachers, who are being questioned as part of a preliminary inquiry into allegations of “organised kidnapping, aggravated violence, deprivation of care and food and aggravated abuse of vulnerable people,” Peyrefitte added. “The first elements of the inquiry, namely interviews with the minors who ran away or former pupils of the establishment, have confirmed our suspicions that offences have been committed,” the prosecutor said. About 42 pupils have been moved to temporary accommodation, of whom between 25 and 30 are believed to be Israeli nationals. Simon Seroussi , a spokesperson for the Israeli embassy in Paris, said the Israeli ambassador, Yael German, had visited the children on Tuesday and reported they were being well cared for. “The ambassador insisted they were allowed to call their parents. Now, with the French and Israeli authorities, we’re doing all we can to ensure the Israeli minors can return to their families in Israel as quickly as possible,” Seroussi told the Guardian. A documentary team from Israeli public television told Agence France-Presse it had been investigating the school for months and had passed information to investigators. “We found ourselves with around 30 witness accounts dating back to the 2000s from former pupils saying they suffered violence,” the documentary film-maker Dubi Kroitoru said. Rivka Azoulay, 26, from Jerusalem, whose 13-year-old brother started at Beth Yossef last week, told the Times of Israel: “It seemed like the Harry Potter school, out in the green spaces.” She said her brother had called home and had seemed happy at the school. Since July the French government agency charged with observing extreme sectarian movements has tracked down several ex-pupils who had returned to the US or Israel and who reportedly spoke of having had their mobile phones and passports taken away while at the school. A number of them told detectives they had been banned from leaving the grounds for several years. France’s chief rabbi, Haïm Korsia, said: “It’s unacceptable for children’s lives to be put in danger. The conditions they were living in are unacceptable, full stop.” There was no reply when the Guardian attempted to contact the school. According to its website, Beth Yossef was founded by Rabbi Gershon Liebman after he arrived in France from Poland in 1948, and it is part of the Ohr Yosef institution. The school day starts at 8am with prayers and ends in the evening with an ethics lesson, a walk in the forest and the study of “sacred texts”. “Today, the yeshiva is proud of its success and brings together more than one hundred students from the around the world … the students assiduously deepen their Torah knowledge in order to become Masters of the Torah themselves,” the school writes.",News/World news,Pupils at Jewish school in France taken into care after abuse allegations,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/02/pupils-ultra-orthodox-jewish-beth-yossef-school-france-taken-into-care-after-abuse-allegations
2/3/2022,"The owner of attractions including Alton Towers, Legoland and Madame Tussauds is to take over Cadbury World in a 50-year deal. Europe’s biggest theme park operator, Merlin Entertainments, which was taken private in a £6bn deal two years ago, is to acquire the operations and brand licences for the attraction at the chocolate-maker’s Bournville factory in the West Midlands.  The £6m attraction, which was opened in 1990 by John Major and is visited by more than 600,000 people annually, is controlled by Cadbury’s parent company, Mondelez International. Kraft, which controversially acquired Cadbury for £12bn in 2010, subsequently created and spun off Mondelez, which is home to snack brands including Trident gum and Oreo. Under the deal, Merlin, whose portfolio also includes the London Eye, The Bear Grylls Adventure and Peppa Pig World, will take on Cadbury World’s 150 employees and hold brand rights usage in the UK. “As we approach Cadbury’s 200th anniversary I’m really excited about this deal,” said Louise Stigant, the UK managing director at Mondelez International. “We want to build on the strong foundations we’ve laid so that people can continue to enjoy Cadbury World for generations to come. By working with Merlin Entertainments, we will be able to bring the history and heritage of the Cadbury brand and the joy of chocolate to more and more people.” Merlin has plans to invest in developing the attraction, which includes the world’s biggest Cadbury shop and an “unmissable 4D chocolate adventure”, ahead of Cadbury’s bicentenary in 2024. Cadbury started in Birmingham in 1824 and moved manufacturing to Bournville in 1879. “We have long-admired Cadbury as the nation’s favourite chocolate brand and have already successfully worked together across a range of experiential activities and retail spaces in our UK theme parks,” said Mark Fisher, the chief development officer at Merlin. “We are now excited to continue the relationship and bring to life the sights, smells and fun experiences that chocolate lovers have come to love, but just with the additional helping of some Merlin magic.” Merlin has intellectual property rights deals with brands including Lego, Bear Grylls, Disney’s Marvel and the BBC. The theme park group, which was founded in 1999, operates more than 130 attractions, along with hotels and holiday villages, in 24 countries. In the UK, its businesses also include Chessington World of Adventures, Blackpool Tower and Dungeons attractions in London and other cities. Merlin was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 2013 but was taken private six years later in a £6bn buyout led by Kirkbi, the private investment company of the family that controls the Lego empire, which took a stake in Merlin in 2005.",News/Business,Alton Towers owner Merlin to take over Cadbury World,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/02/alton-towers-owner-merlin-to-take-over-cadbury-world
2/3/2022,"When the football team I support, West Bromwich Albion, first got promoted to the Premier League 20 years ago, our first away game was at Arsenal and, within half an hour, we were three goals down. I was most fed up. At this point the unmistakable smell of cannabis wafted over us visiting supporters packed in the away end. The vibe was very much of the old TV adverts for Hamlet cigars, featuring people being calmed by smoking after experiencing various disappointments. I have barely touched drugs, but if I’d been offered a puff of something at that moment to take the edge off my pain, I might well have done so. There is a school of thought that part of the reason football hooliganism fell out of fashion for a while was that stuff like cannabis and ecstasy became the fans’ drugs of choice. I’m told these substances are more about peace and love than hate-filled rampages. Alcohol, of course, is more about the latter than the former.  Here’s what happens when you go to away games these days. At least, here’s what happens if you follow West Brom, but I can’t imagine it’s very different with other clubs. Upon entering the stadium through the turnstiles into the visitors’ end, you find yourself on a concourse. A range of overpriced food and drink will be available, including rather weak lager. Always, but always, there will be a large group of younger fans, loosely arranged in a circle, chanting their heads off and making a terrific noise. The chants will either feature words venerating our club or more unpleasant words denigrating other clubs. This choir will tend to be very animated – leaping around, throwing around fair amounts of that overpriced, understrength beer. This kind of thing happens at home games, too, but it’s more spread out. Away matches are more intense because the fans who travel are more dedicated and, arguably, more passionate. Also, kept together in one small part of the ground, and greatly outnumbered, just being there feels like an act of defiance. It was in the away end at Leicester City that, with embarrassing naivety, I once wondered aloud to a copper what on earth this lot had been drinking. “Drink is less of a problem these days,” he sighed. “It’s more about drugs. For the price of a few cans of lager. they can get absolutely wired. And it’s harder to police on trains and to stop them bringing it in.” This was seven years ago. Judging by the scenes ahead of the Euro final last summer, things haven’t much improved. I was outside the away end at Millwall on Saturday chatting to the handler of a sniffer dog, a beautiful wire-haired pointer. He told me he was trained to identify anyone carrying the scent of “pyros” – flares etc – and drugs. Upon catching a whiff of either of these things on anyone, he said, the dog would go up to the person in question, sit down and look up at him. Right on cue, his dog did what my dog does, less usefully, when he sees a squirrel – lurches away, all but tearing your arm off. He took up position: seated before a dismayed-looking West Brom fan. The handler approached the bloke and asked, in a low voice, if he was carrying any drugs. “Not today!” he blurted out. I advised the fellow to come up with a better defence than that if the matter got to court, which it won’t. We lost the game 2-0, which caused some of our fans to stage a mini-riot, damaging a toilet, tearing up seats and letting off flares. So it appears the odd pyro slipped past our pointer. Perhaps some drugs had got through, too, or had already been taken outside the ground. Or perhaps the perpetrators were just idiots, and, as far as I know, dogs aren’t yet able to sniff out idiocy.

2/3/2022,"Lisa Nandy, the shadow levelling-up secretary, has criticised Michael Gove’s long-awaited white paper, claiming it is evidence of “a government in freefall: out of ideas, out of energy”. Presenting his 250-page report to MPs on Wednesday, Gove said it showed the government would “shift wealth and power decisively to working people and their families”, setting out aspirations to level up everything from broadband to bus links.  The levelling-up secretary said the government hoped business investment would help to “turbocharge” growth in neglected parts of the country. “We need to allow overlooked and undervalued communities to take back control of their destiny,” he said. “Our country is an unparalleled success story, but not everyone shares in it. We need to tackle and reverse the inequality which is limiting so many of our horizons.” The flagship white paper sets out 12 “missions”, covering everything from healthy life expectancy to local transport links. The government will legislate to give departments a duty to achieve these goals by 2030 – an approach previously taken by Labour governments in relation to child poverty. In a furious response, however, Nandy, the MP for Wigan, challenged Gove, saying: “Is this it?” Nandy, the MP for Wigan, asked: “They tell us to wait till 2030. But where have they been for the last 12 years?” accusing ministers of “turbocharging the decline of our communities, cutting off choices and chances for a generation of young people”. She added: “He talks about 12 missions. This is 12 admissions of failure.” Gove set out a smorgasbord of specific policies, including everything from ensuring additional Arts Council grants are spent outside London and south-east England; to “refocusing” brownfield development away from the capital. He also signalled a new wave of devolution, with local areas being given the opportunity to create new metropolitan mayors, and negotiations on “county deals”. Gove said the white paper showed that “this people’s government is keeping faith with the working people of this country, by allowing them to take back control of their lives, their communities and their futures”. He argued that the renaissance of areas outside London and the south-east would be driven by private sector investment – though the government is also promising to redirect public spending, including on research and development. Critics of the government’s plans say they are backed with insufficient resources to be workable. However, senior Tories say enshrining the “missions” in legislation could help Gove win future arguments with the Treasury. Will Tanner, the director of the Conservative thinktank Onward, said: “In the long term, the government is crucially changing the rules of the game – by committing the entirety of government to a list of concrete missions to level up the UK by 2030, which will be underpinned by legislation and against which departments, including the Treasury, will be held to account. “Just as the Office for Budget Responsibility drives fiscal discipline, so too will this regime create a rod for the government’s back to ensure that opportunity is spread fairly around the UK.”",News/Politics,‘Is this it?’: Labour lambasts Michael Gove’s levelling up white paper,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/02/is-this-it-labour-lambasts-michael-goves-levelling-up-white-paper
2/3/2022,"A telegram sent by Samuel Beckett to James Joyce on his 49th birthday, 91 years ago today, has been given to the University of Reading by Joyce’s grandson and his wife. The missive, in which the Waiting for Godot author tells his friend: “Teems of times and happy returns. Beckett”, is part of a major collection of books and documents given by Stephen James Joyce and his wife Solange to the university. The donation, which also includes a photograph of Solange and Stephen James Joyce at their wedding, with an awkward-looking Beckett, who was the best man, was announced to mark the centenary of the publication in Paris of Joyce’s seminal novel Ulysses, as well as the 140th anniversary of Joyce’s birth.  “The unusual birthday telegram from Beckett to Joyce says much about them as friends. Short and sweet, the playful language hints at a shared sense of humour and shows the respect Beckett had for the writer who greatly influenced his own writing style,” said Dr Mark Nixon, an English Literature researcher at the University of Reading and co-director of its Beckett International Foundation. “The new collection silverplates the relationship we knew existed between Beckett and Joyce, with their personal correspondence shedding fresh light on the closeness between the two. Such gems among the collection will prove invaluable to those studying these two historic writers.” The university is already home to the Samuel Beckett Collection. Edward Beckett, the nephew of Samuel Beckett, said it was “wonderful to have the Beckett and Joyce archives together under the same roof”. “The two writers were close friends and their estates and families had also stayed close. That it was possible to unite their literary archives is an achievement to applaud,” he added. Almost 900 letters to and from Joyce are included in the collection, the majority of them unpublished, including missives from Beckett, HG Wells, and around 100 from Joyce’s supporter Harriet Shaw Weaver. “There are two or three letters that speak to his struggles to get out of Vichy France in 1940, which was an incredibly fraught time for him. It took him at least three months to get the paperwork sorted out in order to leave France and to get the visa to enter Switzerland, at the end of 1940. And, of course, Joyce died a month later in Switzerland. So one of the last things he does is to get his family out of occupied France,” said Nixon. “This is material from very late in in Joyce’s life, that we don’t have that much of, which makes it exciting.” The collection also includes a copy of the poem Ecce Puer handwritten by Joyce to mark the birth of Stephen Joyce, and a Christmas present from Joyce to his wife Nora, in which he copied out his poetry collection Chamber Music for her. “It’s really quite astonishing,” said Nixon. “It’s a really beautiful sign of his love for Nora. Together with a lot of the personal items and the letters that he wrote to Stephen, it really shows Joyce as a family man, not just this literary giant. A lot of these items show him at his most human.” The University of Reading intends to make the archive publicly available to scholars. “James Joyce was a writer who transformed our ideas about the world, about creativity and about humanity. His letters, manuscripts and artefacts are rightly treasured but we are taking this collection not just to protect it but to share it,” said Professor Robert Van de Noort, vice-chancellor of the institution.",Arts/Books,Major collection of James Joyce documents and books donated to university,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/02/james-joyce-samuel-beckett-major-collection-donated-university
2/3/2022,"A set of delicately carved sculptures cut by hand from the pages of famous Scottish literary works have been sold at auction for more than £50,000, to fund a reading charity. The five pieces were made by an Edinburgh-based artist who began placing her first book sculptures in public places in 2011, captivating the city’s literary world. She insisted on remaining anonymous, adding to the mystique.  She made the five sculptures sold in the auction, which include an elaborate multimedia work cut from JM Barrie’s Peter Pan and another from Whisky Galore, Compton Mackenzie’s tale about whisky-starved Hebridean islanders, for the Scottish Books Trust the following year. The trust, which will be using the sale proceeds to fund its free book banks and reading initiatives for children in less well-off areas of Scotland, then placed them around the country to be found by passersby. In a week-long online auction hosted by the Edinburgh-based auctioneers Lyon & Turnbull, the five works raised £50,500 after a spate of last-minute bids. Peter Pan, which had been originally placed in Barrie’s birthplace, Kirriemuir, fetched £12,000; Whisky Galore, found in 2012 in the lounge bar of the Am Politician on Eriskay – the island where the SS Politician carrying 22,000 cases of whisky ran aground in 1941, achieved £9,000. A carving from the leaves of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure Island reached £13,000, the highest bid of the five. It depicts Long John Silver and a parrot on a treasure chest. It was secreted in the Scottish Seabird Centre in North Berwick. A sculpture from Alasdair Gray’s Glasgow-based modern classic Lanark, featuring the author seated, achieved £9,000 and had been originally placed in Glasgow School of Art; a paper and wire sculpture of Robert Burns’ epic poem Tam o’ Shanter, which shows Tam riding his mare with the witch Nannie in pursuit, and had been placed in the Burns museum in his birthplace of Alloway, reached £10,000. Marc Lambert, the book trust’s chief executive, said the charity was delighted with the sale price. “Thanks to the generous bids, we will be able to provide even more books to those who need them most, though food banks, local authorities and other partners, and deliver more of our life-changing work,” he said. Ian Rankin, the Edinburgh-based crime writer whose novel Hide and Seek was used in the artist’s first series of pieces, knows the artist and said she preferred anonymity. “She doesn’t want recognition for this. For her I think it represents a lot of people’s love for Edinburgh and for reading. This is just a small token of that,” he said. “They comprise a love story. It’s a story of one artist who really appreciates Edinburgh as a city of writers and a city of stories.”",Arts/Books,"Mystery artist’s sculptures from classic Scottish books raise £50,000",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/02/mystery-artists-sculptures-from-classic-scottish-books-raise-50000
2/3/2022,"Pret a Manger is increasing the price of its coffee subscription service by 25% as the cost of milk, coffee beans and staff pay goes up. The coffee shop chain said the monthly fee for up to five barista-made drinks a day would rise to £25 from £20 from 3 February for new subscribers, and from 16 March for those already signed up.  The increase comes less than two months after the advertising watchdog advised Pret, which has about 400 shops in the UK, to rethink how it advertised its subscription service launched in September 2020, after receiving thousands of complaints about options on the deal not being available in some outlets. Pret blamed the imminent price rise on inflation and the government’s planned increase in VAT to 20% from 1 April, from 12.5% at present. It said VAT would add £2 to the cost of the subscription, £1.50 would go towards extra staff pay and a further £1.50 to cover inflation. “We believe the Pret coffee subscription continues to offer great value,” the company said in an email to customers. Coffee is one of the everyday basics whose price has risen significantly during the pandemic as one of the biggest producers, Brazil, suffered from droughts and the worst frost in over two decades while shipping costs soared. It is understood that the price Pret pays for its Arabica coffee beans is likely to rise 40% this year from 2020 levels. The cost of producing milk has soared by nearly a quarter as increased labour and machinery costs have combined with the rising price of cattle feed, driven by inflation in fertiliser costs, which are linked to surging gas prices. Coffee shops in the UK are experiencing further inflationary pressure as they battle for staff after many workers returned to Europe during the pandemic and have not returned post-Brexit. Last month, Pret increased pay for its workers for the second time in four months from a minimum of £9.40 an hour to £9.80. More than 6,900 of its 8,500 UK staff will now earn at least £10 an hour. That came after pay was put up 5% in September. In September, rival chain Costa gave its workers a 5% pay rise to £9.36 an hour while Itsu, the Asian-inspired fast food chain, increased minimum hourly pay by 11% to a minimum of £10.40 an hour. Jeffrey Young, the chief executive of the World Coffee Portal, said coffee shops had also had to deal with an increase in the cost of importing equipment such as coffee machines from Europe after Brexit while even paper cups were more expensive. He said: “Energy costs, the costs of repairing and maintaining buildings, insurance – all of that has gone up substantially,” prompting an average 10p-a-cup rise in the price of a coffee across the UK while profits are still under pressure. Businesses fear that shoppers, who are squeezed for cash amid widespread inflation, will rein in spending at cafes and coffee shops which are struggling to get back on their feet after numerous high-street lockdowns. “When VAT goes up it could be catastrophic,” Young said. “Operators will have to go higher [on price].”",News/Business,Pret a Manger raises price of coffee subscription by 25%,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/02/pret-a-manger-raises-price-of-coffee-subscription-by-25
2/3/2022,"Hormone replacement therapy could be made available over the counter in the UK for the first time under proposals to reclassify one form of the treatment, vaginal oestrogen tablets, which are used to offset symptoms of the menopause. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has launched a public consultation on plans to make Gina 10 vaginal tablets available from pharmacies. The regulator denied reports that suggested all forms of HRT could become available without a prescription. This product is only inserted into the vagina and not taken orally.  The consultation follows a series of recent moves by the government to improve accessibility of HRT. The Guardian reported last year how ministers were planning to “reset the dial” on women’s health to tackle decades of gender inequality in England, with plans to appoint a women’s health tsar, eradicate medical taboos, ban harmful “virginity repair” operations and increase menopause support. It has already been announced that the cost of repeat prescriptions for HRT is be significantly reduced in England. Millions of women in the UK go through the menopause every year, with the majority experiencing some symptoms that can be severe and have a negative impact on everyday life. The particular type of vaginal tablets – called Gina 10 or estradiol – that could be reclassified, are a form of HRT that treat vaginal dryness, caused by oestrogen deficiency in postmenopausal women. GPs, pharmacists and the public are being asked for their views on whether this product should become available over the counter, without a prescription. If reclassified, it would only be made available over the counter to women aged 50 and above who have not had a period for at least a year. Pharmacists would have access to training materials and a checklist enabling them to identify women who can be supplied with this medicine safely. Dr Laura Squire, the chief healthcare quality and access officer at the MHRA, said: “Every response we receive will be vital in helping us gain a better picture of whether people think this form of vaginal HRT should be available over the counter. “The menopause can cause unpleasant symptoms and HRT-based medications form an important part of alleviating them. This is why it’s so important for us to hear what women think about this possible reclassification.” The minister for women’s health, Maria Caulfield, said menopause support was a key issue the government needed to do more to address. “This consultation is another step forward to ensure women’s voices are being heard loud and clear on how they want to access HRT to reduce the impact of the menopause on their lives,” she said. The Proprietary Association of Great Britain (PAGB), which represents the makers of branded over-the-counter medicines, welcomed the move as a “positive step”. Michelle Riddalls, its chief executive, said: “The effects of vaginal atrophy – dryness, soreness, itching, burning, and painful intercourse caused by post-menopausal oestrogen depletion – can be hugely debilitating, affecting women’s emotional wellbeing and self-esteem. “Thanks partly to a growing menopause-awareness movement supported by women in the public eye, the impact of menopause and the challenge of dealing with symptoms such as vaginal atrophy is being recognised as never before.” But Fiona McKay, a businesswoman whose own experience prompted her to launch Menopause Maze, a programme to help women going through the menopause while in the workplace, expressed concerns about the move. “This is great as a short-term access point for women who perhaps can’t get their repeat prescription and need it urgently,” she said. “However, HRT isn’t one size fits all, it’s a very individual medication and can take a real ‘trial and error’ process to get the balance of hormones right. “I worry that, by allowing increased access via over-the-counter HRT, it’s an abdication of care for women – putting the onus back on them to totally ‘self-solve’ one of the biggest life transitions that they will face.” Dr Edward Morris, the president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: “While we support increased access to products like Gina 10, every woman will experience the menopause differently and there is no one size fits all. It is vital that treatment is tailored to her needs and symptoms. “It is important that women feel that they can speak to a doctor about their symptoms, and discuss all the different treatments available for the menopause, including the different types of treatment which may include HRT. We will be responding to the consultation.”",News/Society,Plans to make vaginal HRT tablets available in the UK over the counter,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/02/plans-to-make-vaginal-hrt-tablets-available-in-the-uk-over-the-counter-medicine-hormone-replacement-therapy
2/3/2022,"The European Commission has been accused of undermining its climate goals after it defied critics by pushing ahead with plans to include gas and nuclear in an EU guidebook for “green” investments. Gas and nuclear were deemed bridge technologies to meet the EU’s target of net zero emissions by 2050, in long-awaited proposals on the EU’s “taxonomy for environmentally sustainable economic activities”, which were published on Wednesday.  “The reason we are including gas and nuclear in the way we are doing it is because we firmly believe that this recognises the need for these energy sources in transition,” the EU commissioner for financial services, Mairead McGuinness, told reporters. Critics said including gas and nuclear in a guide intended to prevent greenwashing jeopardised the EU’s climate goals and hopes of keeping global heating below 1.5C. “The European Commission is significantly undermining the EU’s credibility as a climate actor,” Bas Eickhout, a Dutch Green MEP and vice-chair of the European parliament’s environment committee, said. “At the UN climate summit in Glasgow, small steps were taken towards phasing out fossil fuels. Yet, unfortunately, the commission is already turning back the clock and leaving the door open to the gas industry.” Laurence Tubiana, the chief executive of the European Climate Foundation and an architect of the landmark 2015 Paris climate agreement, said: “The EU taxonomy was envisioned as a vital tool to align financial flows with the Paris agreement. Instead, Europe is undermining its climate leadership and lowering standards in the EU and beyond. When a gold standard does emerge elsewhere, this taxonomy will be left behind.” Since the proposals leaked on New Year’s Eve 2021 – fuelling bitter accusations of a lack of transparency – the commission has made minor tweaks that make it easier for gas projects to get in the green guidebook. Gas plants can get the stamp of approval if they switch to low-carbon gases or renewables by 2035. A previous requirement to phase-in low-carbon fuels by 2026 has been dropped. The taxonomy – intended to channel billions of private money into climate-friendly investments – is fast becoming one of the biggest controversies of Ursula von der Leyen’s tenure as European Commission president. Last month Greta Thunberg and climate activists slammed the plans as “fake climate action” that flout scientific advice. In a further sign of anger, campaign group Avaaz staged a mock burial of the taxonomy on a roundabout outside the commission headquarters, with activists wearing face masks of Von der Leyen, Germany’s Olaf Scholz and France’s Emmanuel Macron. France pressured Von der Leyen to grant the stamp of approval for nuclear power, while Germany had lobbied for the inclusion of gas, although Scholz’s coalition government is split on the issue. “Europe is witnessing our biggest setback yet in our moonshot mission,” said Patricia Martín Díaz of Avaaz. “Labelling fossil gas and nuclear as green is incompatible with the EU’s 2050 climate targets and our hope of keeping 1.5C alive.” The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, which represents 375 funds holding €51tn assets under management, also urged the commission to drop gas, citing International Energy Agency studies that show Europe’s existing gas plants will have to close by 2035. ​​ “Put simply, there is no remaining carbon budget for new investments in natural gas,” the group said. Other critics include an expert panel convened by the commission, which said the plans were “not in line” with the original regulation, agreed in July 2020. In its stinging rebuke, the EU platform on sustainable finance – a group that includes industry, NGO and finance experts from EU institutions – said they had doubts about the criteria for gas and nuclear, while “many are deeply concerned about the environmental impacts that may result”. The group said only gas plants emitting less than 100 grams of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt hour over their lifecycle should be allowed, a criteria that excludes conventional gas. In contrast, the commission would allow gas plants emitting 270g CO2e/kWh to be classed as “sustainable” until 2030. A second alternative would allow gas plants that emit an average of 550g CO2 e/kWh over a twenty-year lifespan. Critics describe this as loophole that allows new gas plants to be built on a promise of carbon capture technology that is yet to take off. The EU taxonomy became law in July 2020, but legislators left important details to be resolved through so-called delegated acts – secondary legislation meant for technical issues that is not subject to the same degree of ministerial and parliamentary oversight. Critics have accused the commission of abusing the process, by smuggling in the controversial issues of nuclear and gas into the latest delegated act, rather than drafting a separate law. Only a supermajority of 20 out of 27 EU member states, or a majority of the European parliament’s 705 MEPs can now defeat the plans during a scrutiny period of four to six months that began on Wednesday. Commission officials played down the threat of a legal challenge from Austria and Luxembourg, describing it as “a very theoretical discussion”. Both countries oppose nuclear power, while Green ministers in the German coalition government have dismissed the plans as greenwashing. Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands had urged the commission not to label gas as green, while Germany declared its opposition to nuclear. Yet France, backed by central and eastern European member states, lobbied Von der Leyen to include gas and nuclear, which they consider as a bridge to the EU’s net zero future. The largest group in the European parliament, the European People’s party has come out in favour of gas, underscoring the difficulties of defeating the plans. “Flexibility is needed in the way we decarbonise. If, for example, Poland would like to replace a coal plant with several small gas plants, this should be possible if it helps achieve climate neutrality”, Esther de Lange, a Dutch Christian Democrat, said. Lisa Fischer, who leads the E3G thinktank’s work on climate neutral energy systems, said gas and nuclear had no place in the taxonomy. “Gas investments are not only harmful to the climate they are also increasingly financially risky. Nuclear makes the EU’s energy transition more costly than it needs to be.” In a sign of the intense arguments, McGuinness revealed that had been no unanimity among the commission’s top 27 officials; she said an “overwhelming majority” of EU commissioners had backed the plans. “We were legally obliged to do this,” she said referring back to the initial July 2020 law. Opponents in national capitals, however, say the commission had no obligation to include gas or nuclear.",News/Environment,EU includes gas and nuclear in guidebook for ‘green’ investments,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/02/eu-guidebook-taxonomy-green-investments-gas-nuclear-included

2/3/2022,"Innocent drinks have been accused of “greenwashing” by plastic pollution campaigners after releasing an advert that claims buying their smoothies can help save the environment. Activists, who recently occupied the company’s headquarters, have lodged a complaint with the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) about claims made in an advert entitled Little Drinks, Big Dreams. The ASA is currently reviewing the evidence submitted by the activists and Innocent, and is expected to make a ruling imminently.  The TV ad tells the story of a man and and his aquatic sidekick, Otter, as their boat is hijacked by revellers celebrating and making a mess as they approach a large waterfall. They sing about “messing up the planet” until they find themselves in peril, hanging off the edge of a cliff. They then row back to safety, clear up the rubbish, and start turning apples on a tree into Innocent smoothies, which they all consume as they “fix up the planet”. The brand, which is known for its “wackaging”, has been making an effort to boost its climate credentials among consumers. Kirsty Hunter, Innocent’s marketing director, said when the ad launched that the company hoped the message would turn consumers into “recycling activists”, but campaigners have argued it is misleading to suggest that purchasing single-use plastic can save the planet. Douglas Lamont, the company’s chief executive, said at the time: “The launch of Little Drinks, Big Dreams is an important moment for us. It gives us a platform to talk about the many fantastic initiatives within the company – from carbon reduction to recycling, sustainable farming and helping people and communities – sharing information and what we’ve learned along the way and hopefully inspiring others.” Matt Palmer of the direct action group Plastics Rebellion said: “Greenwashing is dangerous – in the case of Innocent it’s one thing to hide your ecocidal practices, that’s bad enough, but to go to the next level and pretend you’re ‘fixing up the planet’ is far worse. It means that people will willingly – and unwittingly – opt in to support your project in the belief that they are doing good for the planet.” Plastics Rebellion pointed out that Innocent was owned by Coca-Cola, which has frequently been accused of creating pollution, and was recently found to be the brand most littered on British beaches. The group also claimed Innocent created 32,000 plastic bottles an hour, and said plastic bottles were responsible for a large amount of marine pollution. The group also said that by repeating the mantra “reduce, reuse, recycle”, Innocent was guilty of “trivialising the plastic crisis”, adding: “Recycling only happens 9% of the time [and] much plastic waste is still landfilled.” Plastics Rebellion has asked that Innocent be banned from making adverts the group described as “greenwashing” in the future.

2/3/2022,"BT is in talks with the Premier League as it enters the final stage of offloading its sports TV business, with possible deals from streaming service Dazn and US pay-TV giant Discovery under discussion at the telecoms giant’s monthly board meeting on Wednesday. Dazn, the “Netflix for sport” that has made no secret of its desire to secure crown jewel Premier League rights to ignite its streaming business in the UK, has been positioned as the favourite since BT began exploring strategic options for BT Sport last April.  However, Eurosport owner Discovery, which has expressed interest in Premier League rights in the past and has a £920m deal for the TV rights to the Olympics across Europe, is considered to still be in contention. BT, which will also need any deal to be signed off by the Champions League, for which it holds the UK rights, is expected to gain clearance as the rights bodies need a viable second player to Sky after the current three-year cycle ends in 2025. “This level of engagement with the rights holder typically means that the commercial wrangling over a deal is for the most part done,” said one source, who has been involved in similar change-of-ownership deals. “That tends to signal the last stage.” BT’s board was due to meet on Wednesday with an agenda that includes discussing the strategic review of BT Sport, which is also complicated by carriage deals with Sky that will need to be re-examined with a change of ownership ahead of the company’s third-quarter results on Thursday. There have been significant hurdles surrounding the offloading of the sports TV business, including what financial guarantees may be needed around the current multibillion-pound rights deals BT has in place. Dazn, which is backed by the multi-billionaire Sir Leonard Blavatnik, remains heavily loss-making. The decade-old BT Sport business, which has UK rights to sports including Champions League football and Premiership Rugby, has cost the company billions in sports rights but also succeeded in stemming the defection of millions of broadband customers to Sky, which offers its own service packaged with prime sports. In recent years, the battle between BT and Sky has cooled after a groundbreaking channel-sharing deal allowing customers to watch all Premier League games without being forced to buy separate TV packages. The company has instead focused on aggregating content through its BT TV service, offering content from partners including Sky, Netflix and Amazon. With broadband customer churn stabilised, BT is seeking to refocus its business on its core telecoms operation. The company is investing £12.5bn in upgrading much of the UK’s internet network to next-generation full-fibre broadband and is spending billions on building its 5G mobile network.
