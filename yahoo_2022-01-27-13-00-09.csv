1/27/2022,"Bright red billboards have popped up in major cities on the east and west coasts, and down south to Texas, offering criticism in bold white letters. Some may describe them as snide and clever, and each has a very direct point. “Live where you can actually save for a rainy day,” a billboard in Seattle declared, Geekwire reported. “Keep Austin weird. Like very high cost of living weird,” read another in Texas, according to the San Antonio Express News. A more recent example says, “300 days of sunshine doesn’t matter if you’re always inside working,” the outlet reported. Next to these remarks is the culprit’s name — Ohio, and a web address, OhioIsForLeaders.com . Anyone who’s seen the billboards, or those just learning about them now, may be wondering: What is the “Buckeye State” getting at with these signs? What is a buckeye, and do I even care enough to Google it? And where is the state of Ohio, again? The state — situated somewhere in the midwest — wants people to move there, and the billboards are all part of the ploy, Cleveland.com reports. And with many willing and able to move freely, since the COVID-19 pandemic kicked off the work-from-home shift for millions, the opportunity to bring in new Ohioans has never been better. Question for people who live outside Ohio - what do you think of these signs and do they make you want to move/move back to Ohio? pic.twitter.com/neHnAfCIhJ — Jo Ingles (@joingles) February 8, 2021 JobsOhio, the state-funded economic development group behind the billboard campaign, writes on its website that the coasts were once “the place to be … but high costs of living and doing business and population problems are influencing citizens to look for other options.” Aside from bringing in more people and workers, Ohio aims to court businesses as well, outlets report.

It’s designed to have some fun while we’re being kind of edgy.” While “edgy” is a relative term, JobsOhio wasn’t afraid to touch on the topic most sensitive, most sacred to Texans — size. “Everything is bigger in Texas, except your house,” another Austin billboard read, the outlet reported. ‘Get off your butt’ billboard paid for by Missouri business owners sparks controversy Huge ‘God Bless Abortions’ banner draped across 7-story Christ of the Ozarks statue PETA starts beef with Oklahoma governor, and he responds by planning a cookout",U.S./Fort Worth Star-Telegram,Is Ohio trying to pick a fight?

1/27/2022,"Most Republicans are neither embracing nor condemning scandal-ridden Rep. Matt Gaetz. Yet they may soon face a decision day — one they've been happy to avoid, since Gaetz is one of former President Donald Trump's most vocal defenders — and some Republicans are quietly preparing for the real possibility that federal officials will charge the Florida Republican with crimes. Earlier this month, Gaetz's ex-girlfriend testified before a federal grand jury. She could be a key witness in the Justice Department's probe into whether the Gaetz violated federal sex-trafficking laws and obstructed justice. And this week The Daily Beast reported that a potential witness in the case has pleaded guilty in federal court for fraud and illegally selling the drug Adderall, and is cooperating with the Gaetz investigation. ""Big Joe"" Ellicott, a former Florida shock jock with potentially key information about the sex trafficking ring involving Rep. Matt Gaetz, has pleaded guilty in federal court, The Daily Beast has learned. Luis Alvarado, a Republican political strategist, told Insider that Gaetz has staying power because he still embodies ideals espoused by Trump. Trump, too, faced dozens of accusations of sexual assault or misconduct but still won the presidency — and is angling toward another run in 2024 while serving as the Republican Party's de facto leader. ""Matt Gaetz is still a poster boy for Trumpism,"" Alvarado said. ""And if you deny that, then a question arises whether you're still part of that movement."" GOP leaders won't begin to more publicly distance themselves from Gaetz until he's formally charged or brought into court, predicted Republican strategist Keith Naughton. Republicans are acutely aware of their opportunity to win big in the 2022 midterm elections and control both the House and Senate. Vocally speaking out against Gaetz could complicate their efforts to project unity and win congressional majorities that enable them to stall President Joe Biden's agenda in 2023 and 2024. GOP leaders haven't called on Gaetz to resign or stripped him of his committee assignments. And Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who is expected to be the next Speaker of the House if Republicans gain a majority, said in April 2020 that those things would happen only if the accusations against Gaetz proved to be true. McCarthy's office did not respond to questions from Insider about whether leadership still stood by that position today. Other GOP leadership offices also ignored questions about what might cause Republican leaders to discipline Gaetz or ask him to resign — whether it be a bombshell interview, charges, an indictment, or a criminal conviction of some sort. No charges against Gaetz have been filed, and he has repeatedly denied that he had sex with a minor, paid for sex, or obstructed justice. Charges have been brought against Stephen Alford, a Florida developer who tried to extort Gaetz's family over the matter. Joel Greenberg, a former associate of Gaetz, is expected to go before a judge in March to be sentenced after pleading guilty to several charges. Gaetz, who won his 2020 election by more than 30 percentage points, is seeking reelection to his congressional seat in November 2022. He had nearly $1.5 million in his campaign account as of September 30, according to federal records. But signs are emerging that the Department of Justice investigation is affecting Gaetz's ability to function as a congressman — including his policy-making and relationships with colleagues. Some Republicans, who have never much cared for Gaetz since he entered Congress in 2018, have been privately sneering at him in the months since his legal woes began, Insider previously reported. Other Republicans have given donations from Gaetz's campaign committee, called Friends of Matt Gaetz, to charity, according to Federal Election Commission records. Among them is Republican Rep. John Katko of New York, who donated $2,000 to a Syracuse-based charity called In My Father's Kitchen in April, and later announced he would not seek reelection in 2022. Additionally, campaign-disclosure records show GOP Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania gave $2,000 to the Bucks County Fraternal Order of Police, and David Valadao of California gave $4,000 to Marjaree Mason Center, a Fresno-based organization that supports domestic-violence victims. The lawmakers' offices did not respond to Insider's request for comment on why they didn't accept the donations from Gaetz. As long as it looks like Republican leadership is still standing behind Gaetz, the impending investigation won't impact the lawmaker's ability to get political donations for his reelection campaign, Naughton said. ""You've got to have something really sweeping at the leadership level for it to really have an impact,"" he said. Gaetz, to some degree, has become marginalized on the policy front. Take cannabis reform, an issue on which Gaetz has been a congressional leader. In November, for the first time in history, a group of House Republicans, led by Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina, unveiled a bill to legalize cannabis. But missing from the list of sponsors was Gaetz, who has long bucked his party to support legalization, going back to his time as a state representative in the Florida House. He even helped to convince GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis to urge the Florida legislature to lift a state ban on smokable medical cannabis. Asked about Gaetz's omission from the bill, a cannabis-industry source who spoke on condition of anonymity cited the DOJ investigation. ""It has been more difficult for him to lead legislative efforts because of the associated issues,"" the person said. It shows that while Gaetz still has friends in Congress, even his allies are quietly isolating him — or at least not going out of their way to work with him. Insider asked Gaetz last week whether he thought the Justice Department investigation was impeding his work on Capitol Hill. ""No,"" he said. ""Actually, I was just talking to Mr. Cicilline about legislation."" Mr. Cicilline is Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, who confirmed to Insider that Gaetz had ""approached me about an idea he had"" on antitrust legislation. ""He's been a very active member of the antitrust subcommittee and has supported our antitrust package,"" Cicilline said. ""So he's been, you know, very serious."" As for the Justice Department investigation, Cicilline said: ""I don't know anything about that. He's currently a member of Congress serving on that committee. I interact with him in that regard."" Gaetz essentially says the same thing about his situation. ""I don't know what I don't know,"" he said. ""But I'm focused on the work here."" Gaetz has been the lead sponsor on seven bills so far in this congressional session. The one with the largest number of co-sponsors — 19 — would cancel a Washington, D.C., rule forcing customers to show businesses proof that they've received COVID-19 vaccinations. He has co-sponsored 213 other bills. On Monday, Gaetz was one of two Republicans among 27 House members who signed a letter asking Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat of California, and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Republican of California, to swiftly consider legislation that would ban members of Congress from trading individual stocks. Gaetz told Insider he couldn't recall whether anyone asked him to co-sponsor the GOP cannabis bill. He instead pointed out that he was the only Republican co-sponsor of the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act, or MORE Act, which he called ""far more ambitious in its restorative justice"" provisions. The MORE Act passed the House in December 2020 thanks to overwhelming Democratic support, but wasn't taken up by the Senate, which remains opposed to legalization. Rep. Mace's communications director, Barbara Boland, told Insider that ""Gaetz didn't ask to sign on"" to the GOP legislation. Mace previously indicated to Forbes that she wanted to return a donation from Gaetz's campaign committee. She has also gotten into Twitter spats with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a close ally of Gaetz. Gaetz's policy backlash hasn't reached the level faced by Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, a Democrat often at odds with her party's political orthodoxy, who was censured on Saturday by the Arizona Democratic Party after she wouldn't support abolishing the Senate filibuster to advance Democrat-backed voting-rights legislation. Sinema also recently lost endorsements from abortion-rights groups EMILY's List and NARAL Pro-Choice America. Gaetz has been on the opposite end of the abortion debate, consistently voting in favor of limits on the procedure, earning him endorsements from the National Right to Life Committee. Laura Echevarria, spokeswoman for National Right to Life, told Insider that it was too early in the campaign season for endorsements, which happen in the summer. But she added that the group's decision for any candidate would be based on his or her voting record on abortion versus other factors. Recent history has shown that some House members have staying power in Congress despite their scandals. But their colleagues can reach a breaking point when the issues cross into the legal system. Former Rep. Blake Farenthold, a Republican of Texas, faced various sex scandals over the course of seven years before former House Speaker Paul Ryan pressured him in 2018 to resign over a sexual-harassment case. Others, such as former Rep. Mark Foley, a Republican of Florida who sent sexually explicit messages to congressional pages, resigned just days after accusers came out publicly. Then-Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert told reporters he would have demanded Foley be expelled from Congress if he didn't resign. (Hastert himself would later serve prison time for crimes connected to molesting teenage boys.) In 2017, Pelosi worked with the Congressional Black Caucus to pressure former Rep. John Conyers, a Michigan Democrat, to resign after he was publicly accused of sexual harassment. But Democrats weren't immediately in lockstep on the issue. The second-in-command Democrat, then Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, said at the time that the investigation should be allowed to move forward but agreed that Conyers made the right move by stepping down from his role as ranking member. The same outcry hasn't yet come to a head from congressional Republicans monitoring Gaetz's drama. And Gaetz's defenders continue to stand by him and dispute that the investigation is affecting his work on Capitol Hill. Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, praised Gaetz's contribution to the panel and his work riling up conservatives. Jordan told Insider that the investigation ""certainly hasn't changed his ability to go around the country and talk to conservative voters."" ""I trust Matt Gaetz,"" Jordan said. ""What else do you want me to say?"" Since last summer, Gaetz has been on a ""Freedom Tour"" with Greene, holding rallies to bash COVID restrictions and falsely promote the idea that Trump won his 2020 reelection bid. Greene told Insider that she and Gaetz don't talk about the Justice Department investigation and that ""it just doesn't look like there is anything there,"" because no women had come out publicly. ""In my honest opinion I don't think it's affecting him at all,"" she said. ""He has such massive support in his district."" ""Matt's strong,"" Greene added. ""He's doing fine."" Trump, who still has a stronghold on the GOP, doesn't appear to have distanced himself from Gaetz either. A Twitter photo shows Trump posing with Gaetz and his wife, Ginger Luckey, as they rang in the New Year at Mar-a-Lago. —Matt Gaetz (@mattgaetz) January 1, 2022 One former Justice Department official who spoke with Insider on condition of anonymity predicted that if Gaetz ends up getting charged with human trafficking, Trump would likely turn the charges back on Democrats — perhaps by bringing up rape accusations against former President Bill Clinton or the large campaign contributions, mostly to Democrats, made by disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, who was convicted of sex trafficking underage girls. ""Gaetz is almost as toxic as Marjorie Taylor Greene,"" the person said. ""However, Trump's associates are often slimy or controversial and it doesn't seem to impact his supporters.""

1/27/2022,"Humankind is one step closer to making nuclear fusion – the very process that powers stars – a viable energy source. ZYLSTRA: ""I think this is a very exciting time. You know, people have been working on fusion for many decades, and this is literally decades in the making.” U.S. government scientists have announced hitting a huge milestone called “a burning plasma,” which marks a step toward self-sustaining nuclear fusion energy. Alex Zylstra is an experimental physicist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. ""We are publishing findings that for the first time we've been able to create what we call a burning plasma in the laboratory. And burning plasma is one that's related to fusion energy research. And it's a system in which the fuel is mostly heating itself. In the past, we've always had to provide external heating to the fuel to get it hot. But now the fusion is actually doing most of the work for us."" Using the world’s largest laser, the researchers coaxed fusion fuel for the first time to heat itself beyond the heat they zapped into it. The energy they produced was modest – about the equivalent of nine nine-volt batteries – but the experiments represent a big step in the decades-long quest. The scientists cautioned that years of more work are needed. “From there, the next step is actually we want to try to get to the point where the fuel is heating itself so fast that it can overcome mechanisms that reduce the temperature of the fuel. That would be what we would call ignition. Beyond there, we still need to show that we can produce more energy from fusion than we take to actually start the experiment.” Unlike burning fossil fuels or the fission process of existing nuclear power plants, fusion offers the prospect of abundant energy without pollution. Zylstra is encouraged by the progress. “You know, there's many milestones that are being reported in the last few years. It's quite an exciting time for, for fusion. And I think it's also important to note that this particular milestone that we're reporting now is, is exciting because it's the first time that we're able to study how the fusion fuel behaves under these sorts of conditions, and that's key for building our understanding to guide the path forward.""",Science/Reuters Videos,Scientists hit a milestone toward nuclear fusion energy,https://news.yahoo.com/scientists-hit-milestone-toward-nuclear-205213683.html
