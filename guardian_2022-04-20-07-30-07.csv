4/20/2022,"Reproductive rights advocates in Texas have filed a new legal challenge to halt a near-total abortion ban that has been in effect for more than half a year. Senate Bill 8 bars abortion once embryonic cardiac activity is detected – typically as early as six week of pregnancy, which is before most people are aware they are pregnant – and offers no exception for rape or incest. The lawsuit, filed on Tuesday, asks a federal court to rule the extreme law unconstitutional. It cites public threats and legal action from anti-abortion activists against Texas abortion funds, groups that have been instrumental in helping patients travel out of state for care, arguing that this conduct has chilled their first amendment rights. “Plaintiffs urgently need this court to stop Texas’s brazen defiance of the rule of law, uphold the federal constitutional rights of pregnant Texans, and restore the ability of abortion funds and their donors, employees and volunteers to fully serve Texas abortion patients,” the federal court filing reads. SB 8 is not directly enforced by government officials, but includes an unprecedented private enforcement provision that allows any individual – including anti-abortion vigilantes with no connection to the patient – to sue abortion providers or anyone who “aids or abet” care. Those who bring successful suits can win at least $10,000 in damages. The scheme – meant to evade judicial review – has thus far allowed the law to remain in effect, despite previous legal challenges. The new lawsuit takes aim at a handful of anti-abortion activists in Texas as well as rightwing state lawmaker Briscoe Cain, who have all seized on the law’s novel enforcement provision by taking “steps” to sue or publicly threaten Texas abortion funds. In March, Cain sent cease-and-desist letters on his official letterhead to Texas abortion funds, and cited the “criminal abortion ban” – a Texas statute that pre-dates Roe v Wade, the 1973 supreme court decision that guarantees the right to abortion and that is presently under consideration by the US supreme court. Cain also tweeted: “Prosecute Texas Abortion Funds”. Lawyers say the hostile actions by Cain and activists are “chilling” the work of plaintiff Stigma Relief Fund, a non-profit that financially assists those who cannot afford abortion, by causing employees, donors and volunteers to end their relationships with the organization. Wendy Davis, a former Texas senator who famously led an 11-hour filibuster against an anti-abortion bill in 2013 and later ran an unsuccessful bid for Texas governor, and abortion clinic director Marva Sadler, are also plaintiffs in the suit. They say they will no longer be donating to Texas abortion funds as the law is in effect due to the threats. The plaintiffs are represented by the Lawyering Project, who brought the suit in the US western district in Austin. “We are asking the courts today to stop the unconstitutional harassment of abortion funds by confirming SB 8 cannot be used to silence donors with bogus threats,” said Davis in a statement. “It is vital we show up for abortion funds and practical support organizations as they have shown up for pregnant Texans. If you want to fight back against abortion bans like Texas’s SB 8, donate to your local abortion fund and practical support organization today.” Advocates hope the lawsuit will have more success than earlier challenges, after the US supreme court and the Texas supreme court ruled this year that the law could stand. In March, two Texas abortion funds filed suit against two of the activists named in Tuesday’s suit in federal court outside of Texas, in order to evade the conservative fifth circuit court of appeals. Advocates hope the pressure of multiple lawsuits with differing strategies, defendants and venues will help legally erode SB 8. Advocates say the law, in effect since 1 September due the US supreme court’s refusal to block the measure, has inflicted irreparable harm in a state that is home to 10% of the reproductive age population. Texans have been forced to travel hundreds or even thousands of miles for abortion access, overburdening clinics in surrounding states, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Planned Parenthood clinics in Oklahoma alone – which is considering its own SB 8-style law – saw a nearly 2,500% increase in patients from Texas. The ban has forced an average of nearly 1,400 Texans to travel out of state for abortion each month, nearly equal to the number that traveled every year between 2017 and 2019, according to research from the Texas Policy Evaluation Project. The influx of Texas patients to other states has in turn caused a ripple effect across the US reproductive health network. Providers stress the law disproportionately affects the most vulnerable: low-income people, people of color, immigrants and young Texans, who are less likely to secure the resources necessary to venture out of state, including time off work, childcare and lodging. As a result, they are “suffering the physical and psychological impact” of unwanted pregnancy and giving birth “against their will or attempting to end their pregnancies without access to licensed healthcare providers”, the legal complaint says. “Despite the remarkable efforts of abortion funds and practical support organizations, all too many Texans ultimately lack the resources or mobility to access abortion at great distances from home and thus face the devastating consequences of unwanted pregnancy,” said Rupali Sharma, senior counsel and director at the Lawyering Project. “Today, we are asking the court to end Texas’ defiance of the rule of law and uphold the fundamental rights of its residents.” Several state legislatures have proposed copycat abortion bans modeled after Texas, with Idaho signing such a measure into law last month. Anti-abortion officials throughout the country are hoping such measures, unconstitutional under current precedent, will be allowed to stand, with the US supreme court expected to overturn or significantly chip away at the landmark Roe v Wade ruling in a forthcoming decision over a Mississippi 15-week abortion ban.",News/US news,Texas advocates file new legal challenge to near-total abortion ban ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/19/texas-abortion-ban-senate-bill8-legal-challenge
4/20/2022,"Thomas Tuchel believes that Arsenal, Manchester United and Tottenham have spurned opportunities to capitalise on their early exits from the domestic cups and European competitions by making a stronger push for Champions League qualification. Arsenal, United and Spurs have had long spells to prepare for league games this season but their inconsistency has left them scrapping over fourth place. They have been unable to challenge Chelsea, who have a tight grip on third before hosting Arsenal on Wednesday, and Tuchel was amused to hear some of his side’s rivals have been complaining about fatigue. Chelsea have had little time to rest this season and have already played 54 games after winning the Club World Cup and the European Super Cup, making it to the last eight of the Champions League and reaching the FA Cup and Carabao Cup finals. Tuchel has had to manage his squad carefully and he is surprised that Mikel Arteta feels Arsenal are at a disadvantage due to their trip to Stamford Bridge being rescheduled three days before they host United. “Because they have one more day off?” Tuchel said when the topic was raised, sarcastically pointing out that Arsenal’s defeat by Southampton in the league last Saturday came 24 hours before his side won their FA Cup semi-final against Crystal Palace. There was another shrug of the shoulders when the German heard that United are unhappy about the scheduling of their fixture against Chelsea next month. Arsenal have played 38 games after missing out on European qualification and losing in the third round of the FA Cup, United lost in the Champions League last 16 and Spurs failed to qualify from their Europa Conference League group. “They have been given a huge advantage,” Tuchel said. “It depends what you make about your situation. That’s why we can use it as an excuse. We can use it to feel very tired and we feel the challenge at the moment mentally and physically. We can use it to have an excuse if things go wrong. Or we can just accept the challenge and go from there. “I was not happy when Tottenham were out of the Conference League because I thought ‘Wow, I know what Antonio Conte can do with teams when they are focused and he can train them physically’. I thought this will be a huge uplift for them in the domestic competition, and the same for Arsenal when they went out of the Cup. I thought it would be a huge boost for them, because they have a very young and talented team. To train them and to focus on one competition can be an advantage.” Tuchel had a dig at United by pointing that a disappointing season can be more draining than a busy one. “It can be also a disadvantage if, maybe, you are Manchester United and you underperform and you are out of cups and you are out of European competitions too early for what you demand of yourself,” he said. “It can limit your spirit. “It’s very difficult and if you build a team which is built for 60 or 65 games and suddenly you have only 40 and you have whole weeks to prepare for games it can be heavy on your shoulders. It can be more heavy than your heavy legs from playing all the time.” Tuchel, who said that Mateo Kovacic is out for two weeks with damaged ankle ligaments, hinted that Romelu Lukaku could start against Arsenal. He added that Chelsea will hold talks with Kepa Arrizabalaga over the goalkeeper’s future after he was left out against Palace at Wembley.",Sport/Football,Thomas Tuchel claims top-four rivals gained ‘huge advantage’ from cup exits,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/19/thomas-tuchel-claims-top-four-rivals-gained-huge-advantage-from-cup-exits
4/20/2022,"Pep Guardiola has revealed that 71 treatments were administered to his weary players in the 65 and a half hours between Manchester City’s draw at Atlético Madrid and the FA Cup semi-final defeat by Liverpool last Saturday. The high number of treatments was because of the toll of “three finals”, Guardiola said – the home and away legs against Atlético and the Premier League game at home against Liverpool in between. “Our physios made 71 treatments in the space between Atlético Madrid and the semi-final against Liverpool,” City’s manager said. “The full figure is 71, it’s true. I saw the people there. The doctor came to me. But it’s not for just one game, it’s after these three ‘finals’. “They [the medics] told me as it was more than usual. The schedule is what it is. At Millwall [City’s training base for the Cup semi-final] we had six massage tables by the side of the pitch for players – they watched those who didn’t play in Madrid train.” Guardiola was without Kyle Walker, Kevin De Bruyne and Rúben Dias at Wembley. Walker’s ankle problem rules him out of Brighton’s visit for the league match on Wednesday but De Bruyne and Dias await fitness tests. Dias has not played for seven weeks because of a hamstring injury but Guardiola is not concerned about putting the Portuguese defender back in. “He could [play 90 minutes],” he said. “It depends on the game. Tomorrow’s game is so demanding. I haven’t decided on the lineup. I think maybe the last minutes for him but he could start, he could play. I have no doubts about Rúben. With Rúben, it is not a problem. “Over seven weeks, he went to sleep at 10pm, up at 7am – lunch at the same time every day and he stays in the gym and the pool for I don’t know how long. He does it when he is fit and when he is not fit. When he says ‘I’m OK’, then he is OK.” Despite having had to cope without Dias, De Bruyne and Walker because of injury Guardiola prefers to have a small squad. “I like to work with not a big depth of squad. I’ve lived this situation many years in my life, fortunately, as I have been in top clubs – Barcelona, Bayern Munich and now City – and we arrive in the latter stages, fighting for all competitions many times. “I learned from that: that if you want to fight to win, you have to be fit. You need 16, 17 or 18 who you have to have all the while fit, otherwise it’s difficult to handle all of the competitions and be ready for all of them in the best condition. This is not an argument, it’s a fact, because I lived it.” Next season Guardiola hopes to have Erling Haaland in his squad. City are the frontrunners in the race to buy the Borussia Dortmund striker and talks will continue in the coming days. Personal terms and other details have been discussed and City are ready to pay the 21-year-old’s release clause if agreement is reached on all aspects of a deal. Guardiola, pressed on the latest, said: “No answer to your question. No questions – I have no concern about what will happen in this club next season.”",Sport/Football,"Manchester City needed ‘71 treatments’ before semi-final, Pep Guardiola reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/19/manchester-city-needed-71-treatments-before-semi-final-pep-guardiola-reveals
4/20/2022,"With the second-half restart delayed, bizarrely, while the referee, Martin Atkinson, had his microphone refitted, Manchester United’s players tried to stay on their toes by passing a ball about. The Kop responded with olés. It was a typically caustic judgement but one that felt entirely appropriate. To borrow another line from the Liverpool support, their arch rivals hardly touched the ball during what was another chastening defeat. After the 5-0 humbling from last October, this was another occasion that showed Liverpool to be on an altogether different plane. United were a shambles, their defeat grimly inevitable from the moment that Luis Díaz gave Liverpool an early lead and they were in disarray when Mohamed Salah ran onto a pass from the substitute, Diogo Jota, to chip home the fourth. Inspired by the peerless Thiago Alcântara, Liverpool got the result to take them to the top of the Premier League table, at least until Manchester City play Brighton at home on Wednesday night. Salah got the second – his first goal in open play for 12 matches – and Sadio Mané scored the third, with Liverpool piling on the pain. For United, the full-time whistle was the only mercy. United might have signed for a non-humiliating defeat at kick-off, such have been their struggles, with the 5-0 loss at Old Trafford having cast a long shadow. Liverpool were in the deepest vein of form; United had almost forgotten what it was to win convincingly or to have a coherent and consistent plan. Ralf Rangnick twisted again with his lineup and system, recalling Phil Jones in the middle of a back three, which he said had worked well in training on Monday. So that’ll do, then. The last time that United had gone with Harry Maguire, Jones and Victor Lindelöf in a back three was in the 3-3 draw at Sheffield United in November 2019. Jones was hooked at half-time, with the team 1-0 down. Liverpool’s confidence at the outset was reflected in Alisson pulling a Cruyff-style move on Bruno Fernandes before getting his team moving, and the breakthrough goal showcased their well-grooved understandings. United could not lay a glove on them as they worked the ball up from the back, Salah laying off to Jordan Henderson who found Mané in a large seam of space. He released Salah into an even larger one up the right and the cross was made to measure for Díaz. It was a touching moment when, on seven minutes, the Liverpool fans joined their United counterparts in clapping for Cristiano Ronaldo, who was on compassionate leave following the death of his baby son in childbirth. Liverpool called the tune, dominating the ball, supremely untroubled at the back. They were able to waltz into spaces – Salah and Trent Alexander-Arnold, in particular, had oodles of it on the right while Thiago seemed to be playing with his own ball – and the worry for United was when the home team quickened the pace. They did so midway through the first half and, suddenly, it was 2-0. Joël Matip stepped forward, got the ball back from Díaz and played it to Mané. Salah was already running off Diogo Dalot, the makeshift left wing-back, and Mané pivoted to find him. It was a brilliant assist. Salah took a touch before steering home. Rangnick had watched Paul Pogba, jeered by the United support in Saturday’s home win over Norwich, limp off in the 10th minute and, even at that early juncture, it felt as though the midfielder had concluded that he was better off out of there. United were error-strewn, they could barely string two passes together – and, on the two occasions before the interval that they thought they had got Marcus Rashford away with high balls over the top, the striker’s touch deserted him. Rangnick had to feel that the half-time damage could have been worse. Certainly, Liverpool had created the openings. His response? To haul off Jones and switch to 4-3-3. Rangnick craved something, anything. A passing sequence. Glory be, a shot. It was not until the 55th minute that United managed one – a tame effort from the substitute, Jadon Sancho. It was Liverpool’s sixth game in 18 days – two more than United in the same period – although it was not easy to tell. They made the ball do the work, nobody more so than Thiago, who pinged his passes and glided over the turf, swerving here, swaggering there. Almost implausibly, given what had happened in the first half, United dug out something of a foothold in the first part of the second period and Rashford, flagged offside but clearly on for VAR purposes, blew a one-on-one with Alisson. Rashford laboured horribly, although he was not alone. But Liverpool restored order on 68 minutes when Andy Robertson stepped up to rob Anthony Elanga and feed Díaz, whose cut-back was lovely. Mané directed the finish inside David de Gea’s left-hand post.",Sport/Football,Liverpool go top after Mohamed Salah leads torment of Manchester United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/19/liverpool-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report
4/20/2022,"Good morning. Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese will go head-to-head tonight in Brisbane for the first leaders’ debate. The pair are likely to face questions about national security, a federal anti-corruption watchdog and the post-Covid recovery from 100 undecided voters. The aged care staffing crisis is so acute that services cannot be delivered to people relying on home care in some areas, according to providers. Despite the federal government’s $6.5bn pledge to fund an extra 80,000 home care packages, the delivery of services is being compromised by ongoing staffing shortages. Aged & Community Services Australia chief executive, Paul Sadler, says whichever party wins the next election must prioritise “the creation and training of an Australian workforce via real wage increases and training to assist people into aged care”. Labor appears to have lost ground in the opening week of the federal election campaign, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll – but a majority of respondents still think Anthony Albanese will be the next prime minister. Meanwhile, several Coalition politicians have backed a controversial bill that would allow transgender women to be excluded from female sports, as the Liberal party grapples with comments made by the party’s Warringah candidate, Katherine Deves, on the issue. Australia’s 2022 Covid-19 death toll has reached more than double the deaths from 2020 and 2021 combined. Federal health data shows 4,547 deaths have occurred this year to date, compared with 2,239 during 2020 and 2021. Health experts say the figures are unsurprising given the high transmission of Covid as the country moves from the emergency response phase into a disease control phase. New South Wales and Victoria are expected to ease the seven-day isolation requirement for household contacts within days. Russia has launched its long-anticipated offensive in Ukraine’s east and seized the city of Kreminna in the Donbas region. Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from the city, the regional governor said. Moscow announced that its forces had launched one of its largest barrages since the beginning of the invasion. A total of 1,260 military targets were hit by rockets and artillery, according to Russian officials. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said “a significant part of the entire Russian army is now concentrated on this offensive”. The Australian Christian Lobby is targeting moderate Liberals who crossed the floor to strengthen protections in Scott Morrison’s religious discrimination package, distributing leaflets in their electorates showing a mocked-up image of MPs driving a wrecking ball into religious schools. The Australian government said it was “deeply disappointed” by the signing of a security agreement between China and Solomon Islands, arguing the pact has been negotiated in secret and could “undermine stability in our region”. The Greens’ plan for a tax overhaul on offshore gas mega-projects could reap more than $90bn over the next decade, according to costings into reforming the petroleum resources rent tax. Queensland’s sex workers are being forced into unsafe situations due to “outdated” legislation that allows accommodation providers to discriminate against them, say advocates who are calling for reform. Fox Resources says it will “pursue all avenues” to overturn the Queensland government’s decision to reject its coal exploration licence, sparking calls for the federal candidates in the region to outline their positions before the election. UK MPs will vote tomorrow on whether Boris Johnson should be formally investigated over whether he misled them about his knowledge of Covid law-breaking parties. The prime minister addressed MPs for the first time since being fined for breaching lockdown rules to repeat an apology. Shanghai is preparing to ease its lockdown with authorities hoping Covid transmissions in the city of 25 million will mostly be limited to quarantine facilities.

Jupiter’s moon Europa may contain water, according to researchers who believe there could be promising spots to search for signs of life. To prepare for Robert Eggers’ new Viking vengeance flick, The Northman, check out his unsettling horror debut, The Witch: a folk horror movie that worms its way under your skin. “Eggers’ meticulous attention to detail goes a long way to making The Witch work … the dialogue is cribbed from genuine diary entries and documents from the period,” writes Adam Fleet. “While the characters’ manner of speaking may take a little getting used to at first, the payoff is an immersive and authentic experience.” “Labor’s price surge,” yesterday’s Daily Telegraph shouted. “Bill shock war,” said the Herald Sun, reporting on government modelling that estimated an average annual power bill would leap by $560 over the next decade if Labor was running the show. Yet no modelling was produced – and the energy minister, Angus Taylor, did not publicly claim there was any, writes Adam Morton. “This will all be familiar to anyone traumatised by scare campaigns run in Australia’s decade-plus climate wars. This is how lies and doubt get seeded – an easy-to-understand claim about cost based on ‘modelling’, an outraged page one headline, questions that ‘need to be answered’.” If you’ve watched TV at all over the past five decades, you will have spent time with Belinda Giblin, a staple in classics including Sons and Daughters, The Sullivans and Heartbreak High.
