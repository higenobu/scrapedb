2/19/2022,"Twitter user @GlraFFE shared a heartwarming story about a train station in Japan that returned their lost tumbler along with a sweet message.

Upon arriving at home, the Twitter user realized they had lost their tumbler on the Shinkansen bullet train in the Hokuriku region of Japan. After calling the station, GlraFFE was informed that the lost item had been found and requested that it be mailed back due to the long distance between their home and the train station, reported SoraNews24.

A couple of days later, the lost tumbler arrived in the mail wrapped neatly in protective packaging along with a small message that initially looked like a train ticket.

The message card read, “Our customer’s precious item, delivered” and “Delivery Complete. Please Come Again. Toyama Station.”

The back of the message card also had a heartwarming message that read: “Thank you very much for routinely using JR West Japan… We understand the anxiety this must’ve caused you, but we are also happy that we could hand this over to you safely. We pray that you won’t miss your precious items so you can travel with peace of mind when you use us in future. Please return again to Toyama, which is brimming with charm.”

According to SoraNews24, some users commented on the post to share their similar experiences of having their lost items returned with decorated message cards. Others agreed with @GlraFFE’s comment about the “wonderful” service of the Toyama Station.

2/19/2022,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Sen. Ted Cruz has accused Mexico of “undermining the rule of law,” and Mexico's government shot back on Friday, saying at least candidates in Mexico concede defeat when they lose elections. The exchange came after the Republican from Texas claimed there was “deepening civil unrest in Mexico and the breakdown there of civil society, the breakdown of the rule of law.” Cruz was referring to recent killings of journalists and politicians in Mexico. Responding in a letter to Cruz Friday, Mexico’s ambassador to the United States wrote, “I invite you to look at what happened in our national election."" “Without exception, all of the political parties accepted the results and got on with the task of strengthening our democracy and freedom of expression,” Ambassador Esteban Moctezuma wrote. That was a clear reference to Sen. Cruz's actions after the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, that left several people dead in the immediate aftermath, hundreds facing charges and millions of dollars in property damage. Cruz was one of a handful of GOP senators who continued to champion former President Donald Trump’s false claims of voter fraud even after the riot, and court rejections of repeated challenges. Cruz voted against certifying the election results that night and said he has no second thoughts about that vote. Cruz is no stranger to controversies involving Mexico. Cruz was criticized for taking his family to the Mexican resort of Cancun in February 2021 while millions of Texans shivered in unheated homes after severe winter weather battered his state. He cut short the Cancun trip after images circulated of him waiting at a Houston airport for his flight to the resort town. Millions of Texans had lost heat and running water and at least 40 people in Texas died as a result of the storm. Cruz later said the trip was a mistake. Mexico's President Andés Manuel López Obrador, himself hasn't always accepted official results. When official vote counts showed he lost the presidency in 2006 — albeit by a vastly narrower margin than did Trump in 2020 — he rallied supporters to block a major Mexico City boulevard for weeks and staged an inauguration of himself as “legitimate president.” He accepted a clearer loss in 2012 and easily won in 2018.",Politics/Associated Press,Mexico to Sen.

2/19/2022,"The Chinese government faces mounting calls for a more thorough investigation of the high-profile case of a woman who was found chained inside a hut in eastern China.

Among those putting pressure on the ruling Communist Party and the Chinese State Council are the alumni of two top universities in China – Peking University and Tsinghua University – reported the South China Morning Post (SCMP).

The middle-aged Chinese woman, identified only as Yang, was found detained in a small hut with a chain around the neck by a vlogger who visited a small village in Xuzhou City, Jiangsu Province.

On Feb. 15, a hundred alumni of Peking University published an online petition on Weibo asking for a proper investigation of the case.

“The tragic case and suffering of the Xuzhou woman has [sic] aroused widespread compassion, concern… as well as unsettling distress and anger,” read the petition, which was removed from the platform that evening.

The alumni said they are not satisfied with the investigations conducted by the local officers, which they find to be “unconvincing, inconsistent and full of flaws.” They are now urging central authorities to hold Xuzhou officials accountable, confirm the victim’s identity and put a stop to the trafficking of Chinese women.

Multiple other individual posts by users similarly calling for a more thorough investigation were also scrubbed from Chinese social media, according to SCMP.

Another petition posted to Twitter by the alumni of Tsinghua University remains uncensored.

Video footage of the woman’s shackled neck and pitiful living conditions drew immediate public outcry for justice online when it was first posted on the video platform Douyin last month.

According to local authorities in Jiangsu Province, the woman had been diagnosed with a mental illness and was kept in the shack by her legal husband of 24 years. She had eight children with the man who imprisoned her, NextShark reported.

Given her alleged mental health status, people online have questioned whether Yang was able to consent to the marriage.

Amid the growing public outrage, Xuzhou authorities recently arrested the husband for illegal imprisonment, in addition to two other individuals suspected of human trafficking. These recent actions follow their previous denial that this was a case of human trafficking, as many have suggested.

2/19/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Classified information was found in the 15 boxes of White House records that were stored at former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence, the National Archives and Records Administration said Friday in a letter that confirmed the matter has been sent to the Justice Department. The letter from the agency follows numerous reports around Trump's handling of sensitive and even classified information during his time as president and after he left the White House. The revelation could also interest federal investigators responsible for policing the handling of government secrets, though the Justice Department and FBI have not indicated they will pursue. Federal law bars the removal of classified documents to unauthorized locations, though it is possible that Trump could try to argue that, as president, he was the ultimate declassification authority. No matter the legal risk, it exposes him to charges of hypocrisy given his relentless attacks during the 2016 presidential campaign on Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server as secretary of state. The FBI investigated but ultimately did not recommend charges. Trump recently denied reports about his administration's tenuous relationship with the National Archives and his lawyers said that “they are continuing to search for additional presidential records that belong to the National Archives.” The letter from the archivists in response to the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, which is investigating, also details how certain social media records were not captured and preserved by the Trump administration. And it also says that the agency learned that White House staff frequently conducted official business using unofficial messaging accounts and personal phones. Those staff did not copy or forward their official messaging counts, as required by the Presidential Records Act. The letter also goes on to reveal that after Trump left the White House, the National Archives learned that additional paper records that had been torn up by the former president had been transferred to the agency. “Although White House staff during the Trump Administration recovered and taped together some of the torn-up records, a number of other torn-up records that were transferred had not been reconstructed by the White House,” the letter continued. Lawmakers are also seeking information about the contents of the boxes recovered from Mar-a-Lago but the agency cited the records act as holding them back from divulging. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., the chairwoman of the Oversight Committee, said in a statement Friday that “these new revelations deepen my concern about former President Trump's flagrant disregard for federal records law and the potential impact on our historical record.” She added, “I am committed to uncovering the full depth of the Presidential Records Act violations by former President Trump and his top advisors and using those findings to advance critical reforms and prevent future abuses.” The Washington Post first reported that the archivist asked the Justice Department to investigate the discovery of 15 boxes of White House records recovered from Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, and that the former president had a habit in office of tearing up records both “sensitive and mundane.” House investigators will be looking to see if Trump's actions, both during his presidency and after, violated the Presidential Records Act, which was enacted in 1978 after former President Richard Nixon wanted to destroy documents related to the Watergate scandal. The law mandates that presidential records are the property of the U.S. government, rather than belonging to the president himself. A statute, punishable by up to three years in prison, makes it a crime to conceal or intentionally destroy government records. ___ Associated Press writer Eric Tucker contributed to this report.",Politics/Associated Press,National Archives: Trump took classified items to Mar-a-Lago,https://news.yahoo.com/archivist-trump-took-classified-documents-194527183.html
2/19/2022,"The White House slammed Noem for saying she didn't know why South Dakota's LGBTQ people have a high depression rate. ""That makes me sad, and we should figure it out,"" Noem said. Noem signed a bill into law banning transgender girls and women from competing on female sports teams. The White House on Friday derided Republican Gov. Kristi Noem because she was unable to answer a question about the high depression rate within South Dakota's LGBTQ communities. ""Here's a start for you, Governor,"" White House deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre tweeted in response to a clip of Noem. ""1. Don't advance policies that attack trans youth, 2. Don't fund ads attacking LGBT youth, 3. support @POTUS' agenda to enhance support for youth mental health needs, with funding made available through the American Rescue Plan."" Around 87% of LGBTQ residents in the state reported experiencing feelings of depression, the highest rate in the country, according to a recent national study by HelpAdvisor. The clip in Jean-Pierre's tweet shows a reporter asking Noem about the issue at a news conference on Thursday. ""Why do you think that is?"" the reporter asked Noem. ""I don't know,"" Noem replied. ""That makes me sad, and we should figure it out."" —Karine Jean-Pierre (@KJP46) February 18, 2022 Noem made national headlines earlier this month after she signed a bill into law banning transgender girls and college-aged women from participating on sports teams that match their gender identity. South Dakota is the first state to do so this year, and the 10th nationwide. ""This bill is about fairness,"" Noem said at the time. ""It's about allowing biological females in their sex to compete fairly in a level playing field that gives them opportunities for success."" Prior to the bill's passage, Noem released an advertisement highlighting the legislation. ""In South Dakota, only girls play girls' sports,"" the ad says. ""Why? Because of Governor Kristi Noem's leadership."" Opponents have condemned the GOP-led bans as discriminatory and dehumanizing toward LGBTQ youth. Many of the bills have faced legal challenges, as could South Dakota's. More than 85% of transgender and non-binary youth reported that the news of such restrictions have negatively impacted their mental health, according to a survey by the Trevor Project, a suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for LGBTQ youth.

2/19/2022,"Fox 2 St. Louis on Youtube Pit bulls often carry the stigma of violence, despite being loyal, sweet-tempered dogs. That's why we love taking a look back at stories like these that not only restore our faith in our fellow humans but give us a chance to cheer for misunderstood doggos everywhere. This one dates back to October 2020 when a woman was walking her dogs in her north St. Louis neighborhood around 8 a.m. on day and saw a toddler walking down the street. Dressed in pajamas, the toddler's only companion was a large pit bull who trotted calmly alongside. RELATED: Meet Pirate the Pit Bull, a Lovable Service Dog Who Is Helping Change Stereotypes About Bully Breeds ""He looked well taken care of, he was very neat, very clean; he just didn't have [shoes] on,"" the woman, who wished to remain anonymous, told KTVI. Taking it upon herself to find the lost boy's home, the woman began knocking on doors, trying to see if anyone recognized the child, the pit bull following along the whole way. After hours of searching, the boy's father recognized the child in a social media post and the family finally reunited. Despite being an apparent stray, the pit bull stayed by the young boy's side the entire time as if he was protecting the child. The boy was clearly equally fond of his newfound buddy and reportedly kept repeating ""puppy"" during the reunion with his father. For the neighbor who found the boy, helping to find his home was the least she could do for the sake of her neighborhood. ""It is important that we stick together, that we help each other, that we go back to the things that our grandparents and their community used to do,"" she told the TV station. ""That we build a sense of unity.""",U.S./Daily Paws,Stray Pit Bull Protects Toddler Who Was Wandering St. Louis Streets Alone,https://news.yahoo.com/stray-pit-bull-protects-toddler-201603758.html
