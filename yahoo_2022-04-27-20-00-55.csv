Subscribe Wednesday, April 27, 2022 ""I recommend the S&P 500 index fund and have for a long, long time to people,"" billionaire investor Warren Buffett said at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholders meeting last May. That’s been pretty good advice, and I wouldn’t be surprised if he repeated it again at the upcoming shareholder meeting on Saturday. In a report published last month, S&P Dow Jones Indices (SPDJI) analysts found that 85.1% of U.S. large-cap equity fund managers underperformed the S&P 500 in 2021. It was the 12th straight year that more than half of the managers in this category lagged the index. In other words, investors following Buffett’s advice have outperformed most professional money managers every year for more than a decade. Sure, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) has been having a rough go lately, falling about 13% from its Jan. 4 high of 4,818. But as SPDJI’s data suggests, it’s incredibly difficult to overweight and underweight stocks in a way where you beat the market. Indeed, many of the most popular stocks in the market have been doing terribly. On Tuesday, Mike Zaccardi tweeted stats showing how Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA), and Facebook parent Meta (FB) are all down between 20% and 53% from their highs. Following last Tuesday’s disastrous earnings announcement, Netflix (NFLX) shares are now down by 70% from their recent high. According to a different report, SPDJI analysts found that only 22% of the stocks in the S&P 500 outperformed the index from 2000 to 2020. No one’s saying that investors should outright avoid trying to pick winners for their stock portfolio. However, investors should understand that stock-picking is incredibly hard, and there’s a pretty good chance that you will ultimately underperform the market.

4/27/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Four European gas buyers have already paid for supplies in rubles as President Vladimir Putin demanded, according to a person close to Russian gas giant Gazprom PJSC.

Ten European companies have already opened the accounts at Gazprombank needed to meet Russia’s payment demands, the person said. Supplies to Poland and Bulgaria were cut off after they refused Gazprom’s proposed mechanism for ruble payments, which the gas giant says does not violate European Union sanctions, according to the person. Russia supplies gas via pipelines to 23 European countries. After the EU imposed sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, Moscow demanded that it be paid in rubles for shipments starting April 1. But the bloc told member states that the mechanism the Kremlin proposed, which required opening euro and ruble accounts with state-controlled Gazprombank, would violate the sanctions.

4/27/2022,"Twitter's co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey is poised to receive a significant payday if Elon Musk's $44 billion acquisition of the social media giant closes, as his Twitter shares would be converted into cash. Dorsey, who has declined to take a salary from the company and instead chose to take a $1.40 annual paycheck, owns 2.4% of the company, with just over 18 million shares. Under Musk's offer to buy each Twitter share for $54.20, Dorsey would receive a $978 million in cash, according to a report from The Wrap. The company's current CEO Parag Agrawal would also be set for a significant compensation package if the deal closes. If Musk were to bring in new management, Agrawal would receive $38.7 million due to a clause in his contract, according to the company's latest proxy filing. Agrawal's total compensation for 2021 was $30.4 million, largely in stock awards. As for other Twitter executives, the company's CFO, Ned Segal, would receive $25.4 million if the company sold and Musk brought in new management. The social media giant's chief legal officer Vijaya Gadde would get $12.4 million, whereas Twitter's chief customer officer Sarah Personette would receive $11.2 million. Following the news that Twitter had accepted Elon Musk’s takeover offer, Dorsey expressed his approval of the proposed acquisition. In a tweet thread that starts out with a link to Radiohead’s “Everything In Its Right Place,” Dorsey said that “in principle, I don’t believe anyone should own or run Twitter. It wants to be a public good at a protocol level, not a company. Solving for the problem of it being a company, however, Elon is the singular solution I trust. I trust his mission to extend the light of consciousness.” Dorsey went on to say that Musk's goal of creating a platform that is ""maximally trusted and broadly inclusive"" is the right one and that this goal aligns with Agrawal's vision for the platform as well. He concluded by saying that ""this is the right path"" and that he is ""happy Twitter will continue to serve the public conversation."" Agrawal's reaction to the news was more subdued, noting in a tweet that ""Twitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world. Deeply proud of our teams and inspired by the work that has never been more important."" As with many things surrounding the acquisition, it's unknown if Agrawal will remain in his position as CEO if the deal goes through. However, Musk had stated in SEC filings that he did not have confidence in Twitter’s current management, which indicates that Agrawal and other Twitter executives may not remain in their positions once Musk takes control. Twitter says the transaction, which was unanimously approved by the board, will likely close this year following shareholder and regulatory approval and “the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.” How’d we get here, you may ask?
