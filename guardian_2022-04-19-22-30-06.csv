4/19/2022,"Let me be the first to admit that I’m not an expert on testicles. I’m not even an amateur enthusiast, if I’m being honest. Still, even with my limited knowledge of the subject, I was taken aback by recent claims that applying infrared beams to the little fellas might be the key to saving men and averting the apocalypse. The source of these unusual claims? Fox News, that perennial font of spuriously sourced wisdom. Tucker Carlson, one of the most popular pundits on the network, recently had the Ohio-based fitness professional Andrew McGovern on his show to discuss how one might “reverse the effects of falling testosterone”. (As everyone knows, if you’ve got a complex question about hormones, personal trainers make far better sources than endocrinologists). One of McGovern’s ideas to increase testosterone was red light therapy or “testicle tanning”, which he described as a “bromeopathic” therapy. Carlson, who has spent much of the past year spreading misinformation about Covid vaccines, and recently joked about how he’s unvaccinated, appeared intrigued by the unorthodox concept. “Open your mind,” he told the singer Kid Rock, a guest on his programme, who was rather more sceptical. “Don’t you think, at this point, when so many of the therapies, the paths they’ve told us to take, have turned out to be dead ends that really hurt people, why wouldn’t open-minded people seek new solutions?” (Kid Rock did not agree – and when Kid Rock is the voice of a reason in an argument you know things are dire.) Carlson’s own mind, it should be said, has been bursting open at the seams with testosterone recently. The broadcaster has a new documentary coming out called The End of Men which, as far as I can gather, is all about how men aren’t as tough as they used to be and don’t produce as much sperm as they used to do, and how we’re all going to die because of this. I say “as far as I can gather”, because the documentary’s trailer, a condensed version of which just went viral on Twitter, doesn’t contain a coherent argument, just lots and lots of crotch shots. It’s an incredibly homoerotic montage of muscly men, including one very bizarre shot of a naked dude standing in front of what looks like a large lateral flow test with a red glow around his manly bits. While Carlson’s visual metaphors are inspired, the meat of his documentary appears to be anything but. If I had a penny for every time a highly privileged rightwing man proclaimed masculinity to be in peril I would have more money than Elon Musk. Last year, for example, the Republican politician Josh Hawley lamented that feminists and the left want to “give us a world beyond men”. These evil forces have demonised men, Hawley said, forcing them to withdraw into the “enclave of idleness and pornography and video games”. Which honestly doesn’t sound like such a bad deal to me. But I’ll give credit where its due. Carlson’s opinions on the crisis of masculinity may be trite, but I think his embrace of testicle tanning is, overall, a positive development. Much of the man’s time is currently spent peddling racist and hateful ideas to large swathes of the US. If we can get him to embrace “bromeopathy” instead, if we can turn him into the male equivalent of Gwyneth Paltrow, we can minimise his harm. Far better that he sells luxury testicle tanners on his own version of Goop than peddles hate on Fox News. That said, I don’t want to imply that people like Carlson and Hawley are entirely off base when they complain about masculinity being in peril. They are, in fact, entirely correct that that the modern world is bad for men. But it’s not woke culture men need to be worried about: it’s toxic chemicals and pollution, not gender theory, that are are shrinking penises and lowering sperm counts. But how on earth do we get these rightwingers to realise they need to be more concerned about the climate crisis than the left. It’s a tough nut to crack.

4/19/2022,"The International Monetary Fund has cut its global growth forecasts because of the war in Ukraine, warning that Russia’s invasion could lead to the fragmentation of the world economy into rival blocs. In a half-yearly update, the IMF said prospects had worsened “significantly” in the past three months as it reduced its growth estimate for 2022 from 4.4% to 3.6%. The Washington-based body said every member of the G7 group of leading industrialised nations and the bigger developing countries would grow less rapidly this year than previously expected, and there was a strong risk of an even worse outcome. “In the matter of a few weeks, the world has yet again experienced a major, transformative shock. Just as a durable recovery from the pandemic-induced global economic collapse appeared in sight, the war has created the very real prospect that a large part of the recent gains will be erased,” said Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF’s economic counsellor and director of research. The UK is expected to be the joint-best performer in the G7 this year despite having its growth estimate cut from 4.7% to 3.7%, but is set to be the worst performer next year when the IMF is pencilling in expansion of just 1.2%. Consumer spending is predicted to be weaker than expected as the cost of living crisis bites while tighter financial conditions are expected to cool investment. The US will suffer the least damage from the war and has had its growth forecast for 2022 shaved by 0.3 points to 3.7%. Germany and Italy, both more exposed to Russia, have had their growth estimates reduced by 1.7 points and 1.5 points respectively to 2.1% and 2.3%. Russia is on course for two years of falling output as a result of western sanctions (8.5% this year and 2.3% in 2023), while Ukraine’s economy will shrink by 35% in 2022 and feel the impact of the conflict for years to come, the IMF said in its world economic outlook. The IMF produces the outlook in April and October, with updates in January and July. Six months ago it was expecting the easing of pandemic pressures to result in global growth of 4.9% this year. “Global economic prospects have worsened significantly since our last World Economic Outlook forecast in January,” Gourinchas said. “This crisis unfolds while the global economy was on a mending path but had not yet fully recovered from the Covid pandemic, with a significant divergence between the economic recoveries of advanced economies and emerging market and developing ones. Overall risks to economic prospects have risen sharply and policy trade-offs have become ever more challenging.” The IMF said a further two percentage points could be shaved off global growth next year in the event the war in Ukraine led to even higher energy prices, entrenched inflation and big losses on financial markets. Gourinchas said the war had increased the risk of “a more permanent fragmentation of the world economy into geopolitical blocs with distinct technology standards, cross-border payment systems, and reserve currencies. “Such a tectonic shift would entail high adjustment costs and long-run efficiency losses as supply chains and production networks are reconfigured. It also represents a major challenge to the rules-based framework that has governed international and economic relations for the last 70 years.” He added: “The economic effects of the war are spreading far and wide – like seismic waves that emanate from the epicentre of an earthquake – mainly through commodity markets, trade, and financial linkages. In many countries, inflation has become a central concern. In some advanced economies, including the US and some European countries, it has reached its highest level in more than 40 years, in the context of tight labor markets. “There is a rising risk that inflation expectations become de-anchored, prompting a more aggressive tightening response from central banks. In emerging market and developing economies, increases in food and fuel prices could significantly increase the risk of social unrest.” The IMF expects inflation to average 5.7% in advanced economies and 8.7% in emerging market and developing economies this year – 1.8 and 2.8 percentage points higher than projected in January.",News/Business,IMF cuts global growth forecast over Ukraine war,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/19/imf-cuts-global-growth-forecast-over-ukraine-war
4/19/2022,"Things are not the same as they were before the pandemic. We have a new highly transmissible disease in our midst and we can’t expect that doing the same thing as before coronavirus will lead to the same results. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the minister for government efficiency, has written to all secretaries of state asking them to encourage civil servants in their departments back into the workplace: “Now that we are learning to live with Covid and have lifted all legal restrictions in England, we must continue to accelerate the return of civil servants to office buildings to realise the benefits of face-to-face, collaborative working and the wider benefits for the economy.” It’s understood that full capacity doesn’t mean all civil servants returning to work in person, apparently due to the lack of space in Whitehall offices, but secretaries have been urged “to issue a clear message to civil servants” to return to the office so that departments can “run at full capacity”. This blanket edict comes in direct contradiction to a report from the Institute for Government thinktank. Reducing hybrid working opportunities, it suggests, will mean the government struggles to achieve its goals of competing with the private sector to recruit its preferred candidates for civil service positions, relocating centres of civil service away from the capital and reducing the size of its estate. Perhaps more pertinently, encouraging people unnecessarily into crowded work environments is not a good strategy for controlling Covid transmission, especially when rates are already extremely high, as they are now. The phrase “learning to live with Covid”, as used by Rees-Mogg, has become a byword among government ministers for removing all Covid mitigations and returning to pre-pandemic practices. But things are not the same as they were before. As we have seen over the past few weeks, the “return to normal” has been accompanied by large-scale disruption to schools and businesses due to infections and reinfections. The NHS is once again under extreme pressure. Years of austerity combined with Covid has brought the service to its knees. Waiting lists in England for routine care are at record highs. In the longer term we should expect millions of people to catch Covid each year resulting in a population that is generally less healthy both from the burden of infection and the long-term consequences of the virus. The regressive move of forcing people back into busy workplaces can only be expected to exacerbate our Covid problems. Taking away the tools that mitigate the spread of Covid – free testing, supported isolation, mask mandates and flexible working – or the tools that help us monitor the situation (the Zoe symptom tracker study and the React-1 survey) won’t ameliorate the UK’s Covid situation, but only make it worse. It smacks of a government that is desperate to put the pandemic behind it by simply ignoring what is happening. Instead, we should be increasing basic public health measures such as contract tracing, testing and surveillance, rather than scaling them back. We should improve public health communication so people understand how best to protect themselves and their communities. We should be instituting mandatory criteria for the quality of indoor air by improving ventilation, filtration and sterilisation, as well as encouraging people to wear high-grade masks in indoor public settings. If, as seems likely, the government is going to accept the huge disease burden that Covid poses, then, at the very least, we must address the chronic underfunding facing the NHS. Capacity must be scaled up and additional resources funnelled to primary care alongside the integration of sustainable plans for social care. Unfortunately, it turns out that Covid is a problem you can only tackle head on. Closing your eyes and hoping for the best doesn’t work. Nor does declaring the pandemic over, as former health secretary Matt Hancock has done. No matter how loudly the government protests, the virus won’t listen.

4/19/2022,"Gloom at the International Monetary Fund is nothing new. Since last summer the body responsible for stabilising and supporting the world economy has been growing ever more pessimistic. First it was rising inflationary pressures caused by supply-side bottlenecks. Then it was the arrival of the new Omicron variant towards the end of 2021. Now it is the war in Ukraine, something not anticipated when the Washington-based organisation last published its assessment in January but which dominates the IMF’s world economic outlook. It is not just the fact that Russia’s invasion will lead to appreciably slower growth and higher inflation this year – although both look inevitable. The IMF also warns the war has exacerbated two tricky policy dilemmas, one facing central banks and one troubling finance ministers. For central banks, such as the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve, the issue is how to tackle mounting cost of living crises without killing off still incomplete recoveries from the pandemic. That’s not going to be easy, as the IMF freely admits. For finance ministers, such as Rishi Sunak, it is getting the balance right between protecting the most vulnerable while repairing the damage caused to the public finances by Covid-19 spending. The IMF understands the difficulties but warns against being too penny-pinching. “Following a huge and necessary fiscal expansion in many countries during the pandemic, debt levels are at all-time highs and governments are more exposed than ever to higher interest rates. The need for consolidation should not prevent governments from prioritising spending with well-targeted support for the vulnerable – including refugees, those struggling because of commodity price spikes, and those affected by the pandemic,” it said. The war, the extent to which central banks raise interest rates and the speed at which finance ministries raise taxes and cut spending will be three of the five key factors shaping the short-term direction of the global economy, the IMF says in its world economic outlook. The other two will be the slowdown in China caused by lockdowns and whether the impact of the pandemic fades as expected from this spring onwards. In the longer term, the Fund is worried that the war will add to de-globalisation forces, leading to fragmentation, rival blocs and weaker multilateral collaboration in areas such as climate change and debt relief. The pandemic – by exposing the fragility of global supply chains – had already pushed the world some way down this path. By highlighting Russia’s vital role in energy markets the war in Ukraine has given this process a further hefty shove.",News/Business,IMF tells governments to protect vulnerable people when tackling Covid debt,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/19/imf-governments-covid-debt-world-economic-outlook
4/19/2022,"Russian forces have seized the city of Kreminna in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region and Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from the city, the regional governor has said. Kreminna, a city of more than 18,000 people about 350 miles (560km) south-east of the capital, Kyiv, appears to be the first city captured in a Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine. “Kreminna is under the control of the ‘Orcs’ [Russians]. They have entered the city,” Serhiy Gaidai, the governor of the Luhansk region, told a briefing on Tuesday. “Our defenders had to withdraw. They have entrenched themselves in new positions and continue to fight the Russian army.” He said Russian forces had attacked “from all sides”. “It is impossible to calculate the number of dead among the civilian population. We have official statistics – about 200 dead – but in reality there are many more,” he said, without making it clear what period the estimated death toll covered. Russia denies targeting civilians. Evacuated residents from the city have said they are unable to reach relatives and friends there. Olena Stetsenko, the head of the City Korupus volunteer organisation located in Kreminna, was evacuated from the city in mid-March. Stetsenko was one of the last to reach someone inside the city before her mobile signal was fully cut off at lunchtime on Monday, she said, hours after Russian forces reportedly took the city. There has been a pattern of Ukrainian towns and villages losing mobile connection shortly after falling under Russian occupation. “My relative said [on Monday] that there were Russian planes and helicopters flying over the town,” said Stetsenko. “They said that [the Russians] were using every single type of heavy equipment: grads [rocket launchers], tanks. “As of yesterday, they were on the outskirts of the city and there was street fighting going on. The [Russians] are afraid to come into the city because of mines,” said Stetsenko, who estimates there are about 3,500 residents left in the city. Natalia Chekhuta, the head of Kreminna’s regional administration from 2015 to 2019, said she was devastated. Chekhuta, who is still a regional councillor for the city, said she had been running volunteer evacuation missions from the start of the war. At first, not many people wanted to evacuate, she said, but in the last three weeks evacuations began “en masse”. Chekhuta and her team were heading to Kreminna on 18 April to collect people as Russian troops broke through Ukrainian defence lines and entered the city. Ukrainian soldiers in a neighbouring town would not let them pass. She found out that one family had tried to leave and their car was shot at – two of them died and another was injured. “The people we were going to collect were ringing me, asking me to still come,” said Chekhuta. “It was so hard; since then we’ve had no contact.” On Saturday 16 April, two days before Russian forces occupied the city, the Guardian travelled there to witness what was the last evacuation of Kreminna residents. In Kreminna’s centre on Saturday, a white armoured bus pulled up on an unassuming street corner and civilians dashed out of basements under scuffed apartment blocks towards the vehicle, clutching bags and pets in their arms. The conductor of the armoured evacuation bus, being run by the local NGO Vostok SOS, crammed their belongings into the hold. The 17 evacuees hugged loved ones and said teary goodbyes to the backdrop of not so distant booms. Those who stayed watched the bus pull away from the cover of the arches of Soviet-era apartment blocks. A stone’s throw away from the pickup point in Kreminna, debris from a recent attack blocked access and the bus had to take a longer and more dangerous detour around the city under the constant threat of more incoming artillery rounds. An elderly man who has trouble walking and with his eyesight was led towards the bus by a younger man. A tense group effort was made to lift him on to the bus and get his legs into a position where was able to sit down inside. The bus then collected a middle-aged woman, who was accompanied by a man who kissed her goodbye in the aisle before jumping off. Victoria Slobodyansk, a 61-year-old retired English teacher, who was travelling with her husband, Oleksandr, her cat in a basket on her lap and a guinea pig in a bag at her feet, said she was leaving because of the images she had seen of Bucha and Hostomel, two towns in the Kyiv region that were devastated under Russian occupation. Speaking from a town in Dnipro region after being evacuated, Slobodyansk said she had been trying to contact her friends and help other people contact their relatives but with no luck. “Someone who’s in France and hasn’t heard from her grandfather for 48 hours has asked me to make calls,” she said. “I know people who live in the same apartment block but none of them have signal. “We are all so worried. All of our souls are hurting for Kreminna. It’s a small town but it’s clean and pretty and we all love it very much.” Slobodyansk said that before she left the city, there had been no gas for three weeks. She said electricity had been cut several times though local workers had managed to re-establish the connection on 15 April. She said residents had been cooking on the streets when there was no electricity. “We knew that it was going to be hard and we knew that they were going to bomb us but our guys would manage to withstand them,” said Slobodyansk. “But we understand that it was hard for them; they were defending their positions for weeks.” Reuters contributed to this report",News/World news,Russian forces capture first city in battle for Donbas,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/19/russian-forces-capture-first-city-battle-donbas-kreminna
4/19/2022,"Voices rise and fall, picking their way through songs and wordless sounds. They break and bend, whisper and tremble. There are cries and ululations, gentle bluesy riffs, operatic moments and open-throated roars, as well as moments when singers are groping for a melody or discovering a new sound, filling the British Pavilion at Venice with a glorious cacophony. Called Feeling Her Way, Sonia Boyce’s multilayered installation is a joyous, tremulous performance for a chorus of Black female voices (Jacqui Dankworth, Poppy Ajudha, Sofia Jernberg and Tanita Tikaram). Each singer is literally feeling her way through the music, guided by Belize-born British composer Errollyn Wallen. We must feel our way, too, through the space and dissonance, the different tempos and moods and the different characters, qualities and approaches of the musicians. Togetherness and apartness, soulfulness and drive – these are what guide them. Sometimes improvising for the first time, sometimes duetting or surprising themselves with some unbidden echo, the singers seem to be discovering as much as they are performing in their familiar ways. The music has a great and sometimes accidental resonance and complexity. It unfolds as you move through the five spaces of Boyce’s pavilion, the sense of folding and reconfiguring, like a kind of aural origami. Somehow, the repetitions never sound the same, depending on where the listener is, attending first to one singer, then another. Suggesting some kind of resolution that never comes, the filmed performances rearrange themselves in space and time. You don’t have to work at it so much as let yourself go, as you realise that is what the singers are doing, too. Of Boyce’s recent work, this is the most accomplished I have seen, the one that exceeds intention, taking on a life and vitality of its own. Boyce redoubles the musical complexity with her installation, presenting the filmed performances (some of which took place at Abbey Road studios) against a tessellated, montaged wallpaper of photographic shots of studio details – microphone stands and cables, mixing desk consoles, sound-baffles and flooring, mixed in with geometric patterning. Overhead and on the floor, geometric golden forms – derived from iron pyrite crystals – cluster and spread, bunch-up in corners and provide seating for visitors. They mirror what is around them, while also reflecting the order and random structures of music itself. A long wall at the rear of the pavilion has a silvery wallpaper redolent of a 1970s bedroom, on which Boyce presents photographs and collaged displays of old CD, cassette and album covers, along with posters and other ephemera. All part of Boyce’s personal archive, and still bearing their discount price tags, these albums by Shirley Bassey, Beverley Knight, Brown Sugar and Five Star are reverentially presented as though on a teenager’s bedroom wall. When Boyce was younger, there was scant representation of Black female artists in the UK. Music gave her a sense of belonging and sustenance. This archival impulse and sense of communality, continues in the French Pavilion next door, where French-Algerian, London-based artist Zineb Sedira includes a film in which Boyce and curator Gilane Tawadros discuss cultural resistance and survival in communities of colour. At first seeming aurally and visually dissonant and fragmentary, Feeling Her Way reveals itself as a simultaneous expression of individuality and collaboration, and the affirmation of the creative spirit.",Arts/Art and design,‘A glorious cacophony of Black female voices’ – Sonia Boyce’s soul train hits Venice,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/19/sonia-boyce-soul-train-venice-biennale-british-pavilion-glorious-cacophany-black-female-voices
4/19/2022,"“I love anchovies, but often find I have a couple of fillets or those mashed-up bits at the bottom of the tin left over. What can I do with them and the oil?”Jane, Ludlow Ah, anchovies: the little fishes with the big flavour that are equally at home in pasta sauces and stews as they are in a dressing or butter (to rub a roast chicken or lamb, say), or simply eaten on toast. Happily, a little goes a long way, which is good news for Jane and her near-empty tins. “I love anchovies and have them all the time,” says Patrick Martinez, founder of The Tinned Fish Market. And he’s not kidding; the oily fish have made their way into his dinner for the past two nights running. If you’ve got a fillet or two going, Martinez recommends this “very rich, very quick” spaghetti dish: first, get your pasta cooking, and tear some bread (“you want generously-sized breadcrumbs”). Mash up the anchovie,s then fry n some oil from the tin for about 30 seconds. “Add finely sliced garlic for 30 seconds to a minute, then add the breadcrumbs and fry to soak up the oil.” When the spaghetti is ready, drain and stir in a generous spoonful of cream cheese to melt, loosening with some reserved pasta water if need be. “Add the crumbs, stir gently, then all you need is a squeeze of lemon to balance the oiliness and some pepper.” Puttanesca is another eminently sensible way to use up stray fillets, as is the top of a pizza or onion tart. However, when it comes to those broken-up bits lurking in the bottom of the tin, it’s got to be mayonnaise. Chef Ben Tish, who is behind the menu at the recently opened The Princess Royal in west London, says: “Blend egg yolks with any bits of anchovy going, their oil, and mustard, then top up with olive oil.” This can then be used for a multitude of things, but devilled eggs are a current Tish favourite – “that’s delicious”. Alternatively, knock up a vinaigrette: “In a bowl, whisk the anchovies and their oil, add some lemon juice, red-wine vinegar and extra-virgin olive oil, and whisk again.” This is good for drizzling over salads, such as farro, rocket, pomegranate and grilled artichokes. “Toss with the vinaigrette, and you’ve got all those salty and sweet bits.” Also good for topping salads are Martinez’s breadcrumbs from his pasta dish, while food writer and self-confessed anchovy fan Alison Roman uses fillets to make white beans magic. In her book Nothing Fancy, she cooks sliced garlic in olive oil, then adds the fish fillets, capers and chilli flakes, and sizzles until the little fish melt. She tosses in white beans, cooks for about 10 minutes, then finishes with salad leaves, herbs, parmesan and a squeeze of lemon. Serve as is or, Roman writes, “I do dream about eating it with grilled whole trout or lamb shoulder with garlicky tomatoes.” You could also spread this anchovy joy on a kind-of pan con tomate. Tish grills focaccia or ciabatta, then smears it with broken anchovies and their oil. “Top with tomatoes, crush those in as well, and you’ve got a smoky tomato bread.” It will taste even better once those tomatoes hit their stride this summer.

4/19/2022,"As many as four in 10 people in Britain could fall into fuel poverty when the price cap rises again this autumn, energy bosses have told MPs as they called for more government support for vulnerable households facing a “truly horrific” winter. Michael Lewis, the chief executive of E.ON UK, said between 30% and 40% of people in Britain might go into fuel poverty from October when the industry regulator, Ofgem, is again expected to put up the annual limit on tariffs. “We are expecting a severe impact on customers’ ability to pay,” he told MPs at the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee in parliament, adding that he expected debts of customers to rise by 50%, or £800m.   How does the energy price cap work? The cap, one of the biggest shake-ups of the energy market since privatisation, came into effect on 1 January 2019 for 11m households on default tariffs, known as standard variable tariffs (SVTs). The government told the energy regulator, Ofgem, to set the cap because ministers argued people on SVTs were being ripped off by big energy firms capitalising on consumer loyalty. The limit is not an absolute one but the maximum suppliers can charge per unit of energy and for a standing charge. There is a separate cap for 4m homes on prepayment meters. So why are prices moving higher? In short: if energy market prices climb higher, the cap must move higher, too. The cap is designed to reflect the costs energy suppliers face, the largest of which is sourcing gas and electricity from the wholesale markets. In recent months energy markets have reached historic highs because of tight global gas supplies, causing one of the steepest energy price increases on record. Market prices have continued to climb since the new cap was announced, meaning another rise is likely in April once the regulator has revised its cost assessments. Is there any way to avoid the increase? In the past, households could save hundreds of pounds a year by spending a few minutes on one of the many comparison sites, or by signing up to an auto-switching service, and moving to a cheaper tariff, either with their existing supplier or a rival one. But the recent market surge means even fixed tariffs, which are not covered by the cap, are more expensive than the energy price cap itself. The best bet to keep bills in check is to use less energy: if you can afford to invest in insulation this can make a major difference to how much energy you need. Lowering the thermostat by a couple of degrees may also be an option for some.  When will bills begin to fall again? It is too soon to say. Energy market experts believe gas and electricity wholesale prices will remain high through the winter and into 2022 because energy demand is recovering rapidly after the worst of the Covid-19 crisis. Some believe households may face rising energy bills for another 18 months. In addition to market prices, the regulator includes the cost of using energy networks and paying for government policies – which are also expected to keep rising.Jillian Ambrose He said that a larger number of people moving into fuel poverty would lead to a significant increase in bad debt. Customers have been calling energy providers expressing their worry at the huge increase in their bills. ScottishPower alone had received 8,000 calls from customers concerned about their ability to pay, its chief executive, Keith Anderson, told MPs. He said he was “massively concerned” for people facing rising bills who would “really, really struggle” and called for the introduction of a £1,000 deficit fund or social tariff for vulnerable customers. The fund would take £1,000 off the bills of the poorest people in the country in October and the government or consumers would then pay this off over 10 years, he suggested. The energy regulator lifted the price cap on bills earlier this month, sending the average household dual-fuel tariff from £1,278 to £1,971. That is due to increase again in October, with some experts expecting the price cap to hit £2,600. “Come October that’s going to get horrific, truly horrific,” said Anderson. “It has got to a stage now where the size and scale of it is beyond what I can deal with, beyond what I think this industry can deal with. I think it needs a massive shift, a significant shift in the government policy and approach towards this.” The EDF chief executive, Simone Rossi, said it had seen a 40% increase in calls from customers worried about debt. “We are concerned about what is in front of us,” he said. “Unfortunately pre-payment customers are being hit first. We now see bills being higher for longer, so I would expect government to reassess in short order to see what is possible.” Earlier the chief executive of Ofgem, Jonathan Brearley, had said that increases in fuel bills would be investigated amid concerns that suppliers may be charging households unfairly. Gas prices in particular have surged in recent months, prompting almost every household energy supplier to raise prices to the maximum allowed. However, some consumer groups have argued that energy firms have raised prices by more than needed, to strengthen their own balance sheets at customers’ expense. Brearley told BBC Radio 4: “We’re going to take a close look at those direct debits. We’re going to make sure that they are raised fairly – clearly prices have gone up – and if they haven’t been we’ll take action and make sure companies put it right. “You shouldn’t take more than is necessary. You shouldn’t be building up a credit balance.” He said price increases must be brought in “reasonably and fairly” and not for “other reasons outside of the customer interest”. Energy companies should be ringfencing customer money so that it is only used to pay for their gas and electricity, he said.",News/Business,Energy chiefs fear 40% of Britons could fall into fuel poverty in ‘truly horrific winter’ ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/19/energy-chiefs-fear-40-of-britons-could-fall-into-fuel-poverty-in-truly-horrific-winter
4/19/2022,"Boris Johnson became the first sitting prime minister to be criminally sanctioned when he was fined for breaking his own Covid laws by attending a party for his birthday in No 10. While the development prompted renewed calls for his resignation, loyal ministers and Downing Street sources have reached for some creative and elaborate defences of his law breaking. As Johnson prepared to argue he did not mislead parliament, the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, told Sky News on Tuesday morning: I think we do see consistently, whether it is through parking fines or speeding fines, ministers of both parties over the years have been in that position. A senior government source told the Financial Times he had “no idea” what was guiding the Met police investigation after Johnson was given a fixed-penalty notice for attending a party for his birthday in No 10. He added: It’s not as if [Johnson] walked into a rave in Ibiza. Is another defence for Johnson, who was fined for breaching the rules by attending his 56th birthday party in June 2020.

He was eating a salad lunch in the Cabinet room with people he worked with all day. People kept popping in. Tory MP Michael Fabricant dismissed the fines on BBC Radio 5 Live, saying lots of people, ranging from civil servants to nurses and others, “did at the end of the day have a quiet drink”. He also said: The ways it’s been characterised, you would think there were pole dancers. A source told The Times there was an exemption for those working in No 10, in close proximity and for long hours. There was always an exemption around work but the prime minister accepted mistakes were made. If you’re going from meeting to meeting and it’s something at 2pm in the afternoon, people wouldn’t particularly call that a party. You don’t tend to call that a party. This was the line that came from a Tory MP in January on Channel 4 News in January. Conor Burns said it was not a “premeditated” party and that Johnson was working in the room before staff came in and presented him with a birthday cake. He was, in a sense, ambushed with a cake. Those were the words of the Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell in January, saying there are ministers who get parking tickets and speed fines. “Lots of people break the law in small ways, sometimes unintentionally” he said, adding: He’s not robbed a bank. This is getting out of control. Stepping to Johnson’s defence January, the Conservative MP James Heappey told the BBC no prime minister can possibly own all that is put into their diary, adding they rely entirely on those around them for briefs and support for what goes into diaries in the first place. He said: My take as someone who has worked in Downing Street is that the prime minister doesn’t really own his own diary. In January, the Conservative MP Peter Bone described the party for Johnson to BBC Newsnight as “a very funny party” with colleagues for less than 10 minutes. He added that “political people alike” likely spoke about work while eating their “bit of cake”. He added: Well, I just don’t recognise that as a party. And if that’s the sort of parties you go to they’re not much fun, are they?",News/Politics,‘He was ambushed with cake’ and other stories: Tories get creative to defend PM,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/19/he-was-ambushed-with-cake-and-other-stories-tories-get-creative-to-defend-pm
4/19/2022,"We have the Leeds Piano Competition to thank for first showcasing the unique poetry of Radu Lupu’s playing: the young Romanian pianist won first prize there in 1969. That success launched his international career, but as the years went by he became a more and more reticent performer, both in the concert hall and on disc. Yet every rare opportunity to hear him was a reminder of just how special a pianist he was, in a repertory that extended from Mozart and Beethoven to Bartók and Janáček, and who was quite peerless in Schubert, Schumann and Brahms. Here are just a few examples of his art. Video recordings of Lupu’s performances are hard to find, so this Mozart concerto with David Zinman and the Deutsche Kammerphiharmonie is a rarity to be treasured. Taken from a recital in Moscow in 2012, he also recorded the Impromptus in 1983 for Decca. Recorded live in 1983 and a perfect example of Lupu’s ability to transform a relatively modest work, by no means one of Schumann’s greatest, into something very special indeed.

4/19/2022,"Asda’s private equity owner has claimed the value of its investment in the supermarket chain has soared by nearly 20 times as it gears up for a potential bid for the pharmacy chain Boots. The London-based TDR Capital said its stake as co-owner of the grocer was now worth €1.7bn (£1.4bn) on paper, or 19.8 times its original investment, indicating that the finance group put in just over £70m of fresh cash to back the deal, according to documents seen by the Financial Times. The presentation to investors paints a rosy picture of TDR’s investment in Asda as it gears up to potentially raise more funds to back a £6bn buyout of Boots. It is one of four interested parties in the British retailer. The details behind the claim are not clear, as TDR put in an estimated £390m of equity in total to back the £6.8bn buyout of Asda, the same amount as its partners the Issa brothers. Industry insiders said the £70m of fresh investment in the Asda buyout indicated by TDR’s documents could have been supplemented by proceeds from other investments including EG Group, the petrol forecourts business it also owns in partnership with the Issa brothers. Analysts said they were skeptical of the raised valuation of Asda indicated by the documents. One said: “Asda’s performance has been really weak in the market according to [research firm] Kantar. It has structural issues with its less customers more squeezed by the rising cost of living. The question is could they sell it at this price? I think they would struggle to sell it for ages.” The value of TDR’s stake was thought to have been increased partly to reflect the £7bn buyout of Morrisons in October, which valued that chain at a higher amount relative to core earnings than the original Asda deal. However, Morrisons recently warned that its profits were likely to take a significant hit this year as the cost of living crisis and disruption because of the war in Ukraine weigh on the grocery market. The UK’s biggest supermarket chain, Tesco, also warned of “significant uncertainties” at its annual results last week as its customers tighten their belts to cope with rising inflation. Asda’s earnings have improved, while the sale of a group of 27 warehouses to reduce debts fetched £1.7bn last year, beating expectations by more than £700m.",News/Business,Asda co-owner claims value of stake has risen 20-fold as it readies Boots bid,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/19/asda-co-owner-value-stake-boots-bid-tdr-capital
