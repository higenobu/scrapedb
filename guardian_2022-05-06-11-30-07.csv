5/6/2022,"In 2006, it was almost unimaginable that mainstream Australian businesses would spend $2bn in goods and services with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander-owned businesses and employ close to 64,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. If in 2006, you’d told me that Reconciliation Australia’s reconciliation action plans (RAP) program would grow from the eight organisations that stepped up at the program’s launch to the more than 2,000 with active RAPs in 2022, directly reaching almost 4 million Australians, I would have applauded your optimism. But here we are. The process of launching, developing and steering a globally unique initiative that embeds reconciliation throughout an organisation’s business has involved a lot of challenging work and has been far from plain sailing. In the Australian context, recognition of the need for reconciliation and social justice is now a fundamental element of any company’s approach to measuring their social and environmental impact. A RAP is much more than ticking a box in annual reports. They are increasingly used by investors to judge corporate performance, decide who will withhold capital, and influence consumer choices unless minimum environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards are met. Reconciliation is a long journey. It takes sustained leadership for an organisation to wholeheartedly embrace its RAP and commit to long-term transformation. The times when leadership aspiration has disconnected with action, sparking well-deserved scrutiny, are worth revisiting. Telstra has been a longstanding RAP partner. Its senior management has long embraced the principles and actions embodied in their RAP. Yet they became sufficiently disengaged with the seriousness of that commitment that they allowed Telstra-branded stores to sell vulnerable First Nations customers in remote communities phone plans they could neither understand nor afford. Imposing a fine of $50m, the federal court described the conduct as “unconscionable”. In response, Reconciliation Australia revoked Telstra’s “elevate” RAP, and today Telstra is grappling with how to rebuild trust and credibility among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities – and others appalled by the behaviour. This is the power of RAPs to bring meaningful accountability. Innovate RAP partner Woolworths’ then-subsidiary Endeavour Drinks proposed to build an enormous Dan Murphy’s in Darwin on a site very close to three First Nations communities, which, at their own instigation, are “dry” communities where alcohol is both unwelcome and illegal. Aboriginal health, community and advocacy groups responded robustly to this plan, which was completely at odds with the RAP Woolworths said it valued so highly. In the face of the resulting campaign and controversy, including conversations with Reconciliation Australia, Woolworths commissioned an independent panel review. Woolworths responded to the panel’s findings by not going ahead with the store and returning the liquor licence. Reconciliation Australia continues to work with both Woolworths and Telstra, as we do with all RAP partners, to equip and challenge them to continue to grow in their reconciliation journeys. Rio Tinto was another longstanding RAP partner; working closely with us through a series of RAPs, including an elevate RAP. From being a corporate leader in reconciliation, by 2020 it would carry out the catastrophic destruction of Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara. Rio Tinto lost their elevate RAP and is suspended from the program. If Rio’s RAP had been truly integrated and central to its operations and decisions, it would have been easier to find the bravery to question the decision. In fact, it should not have been needed. The company should have intrinsically known what to do with a site like Juukan. In the end, it comes back to organisations to honour and deliver on their RAP. We know they don’t always get it right, but the framework enables them to measure, review, reflect and grow. As we enter the next phase of the RAP program, a couple of features stand out. The first is that for our longest-standing partners, this project of national reconciliation has developed an animating, self-perpetuating life of its own. The leading 200 organisations are now fully networked among themselves, meeting quarterly to compare notes and offer advice to one another. They take this project very seriously. The second is a phrase we adopted to describe how we see the program, and reconciliation, evolving further: “Safe to brave.” It signifies organisations and employees being motivated by the true meaning of their RAP, to make risky and brave choices to advance reconciliation – thinking long-term benefit rather than short-term loss. It means taking on issues, entrenched practices – and sometimes superiors – to reinforce the commitment to reconciliation. It’s important to remember that RAPs are not the sole solution to 230 years of colonisation. Rather, they are an accessible and robust framework for organisations to commit to respectful relationships with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and a useful starting point for organisations to embark on and measure their contributions to a more just, equitable and reconciled country.

5/6/2022,"When Facebook blocked hundreds of Australian emergency services and government pages during the company’s negotiation with the federal government last year it was not an accident, but rather a deliberate negotiating tactic, company whistleblowers have alleged. Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, has strenuously denied the claims. US-based legal organisation Whistleblower Aid said on Friday it had filed a disclosure with the US Department of Justice and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) on behalf of former Facebook employees alleging that Facebook had deliberately over-blocked pages as a means of negotiating a better outcome in the negotiations over legislation to force Meta to pay Australian media companies for news content. The allegations were first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Whistleblower Aid also represented Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen. On 17 February, 2021, Facebook blocked all news on its platform in Australia, including information, government, health and emergency services pages such as Department of Fire and Emergency Services, the Council on Homeless Persons, the Australian Medical Association, the Sydney Local Health District, Suicide Prevention Australia, the Tasmanian Government, SA Health, Fire and Rescue New South Wales and, 1800Respect. Facebook at the time was claiming the legislation would create an unworkable precedent, but said the blocking of government pages was inadvertent. The action forced the federal government back to the negotiating table, and reached a compromise in the legislation stating that Facebook and Google would not be designated as platforms covered by the code if the companies could demonstrate they had successfully negotiated payment deals with media companies in Australia. A Meta spokesperson denied the blocking of Australian government pages was deliberate. “The documents in question clearly show that we intended to exempt Australian government pages from restrictions in an effort to minimise the impact of this misguided and harmful legislation,” the spokesperson said. “When we were unable to do so as intended due to a technical error, we apologised and worked to correct it. Any suggestion to the contrary is categorically and obviously false.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The pages were restored on 22 February 2021, with the remainder coming back online after the legislation passed. To date since the legislation passed, both companies have not been designated under the code, after dozens of deals were negotiated with local media companies, including Guardian Australia. According to the whistleblowers, Facebook had a special “ACCC response team” that “deflected or neutralised” other Facebook employees’ attempts to fix the over-blocking during the negotiations. The whistleblowers also allege that Facebook did not follow the standard process to prevent over-blocking before the action, such as using lists of sensitive accounts not to block, and there was no formal appeals process. Leaked emails published in WSJ, purport to show that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, COO Sheryl Sandberg and head of news partnerships Campbell Brown congratulated the team responsible for the takedown. According to the report, Brown stated it “landed just where [we] wanted,” while Zuckerberg said the best possible outcome had been achieved, and Sandberg said the strategy “set a new high standard”. “Facebook lied not just to the public but to their own employees, many of whom worked tirelessly to propose solutions to the over-blocking problems we now realise were created by Facebook itself – solutions that were ignored or brushed aside,” Libby Liu, CEO of Whistleblower Aid alleged. The Australian communications minister, Paul Fletcher, said the legislation was working as intended, and had kicked off moves for similar legislation in other parts of the world. “Google has entered into commercial deals with at least 19 news organisations, and Facebook with 11. Public reporting suggests that the monetary value of these agreements exceeds $150m per annum,” he said. “If Facebook executives want to portray having to pay out tens of millions of dollars as a win, I’ll leave it to them, merely remarking that it would be a novel use of that word.” Andrew Bakaj, who is representing the whistleblowers, said when Facebook’s interests were threatened, “Facebook didn’t hesitate to squeeze. Hard”.

5/6/2022,"Donald Trump’s former attorney Rudy Giuliani is not expected to appear at an interview scheduled for Friday with the House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol attack, throwing into jeopardy the prospect of his cooperation, say sources familiar with the matter. The move by Giuliani to cancel his appearance after the panel declined his request to record the interview means it may not secure documents and testimony from a central figure in Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election in time for public hearings in June. Giuliani was expected to have revealed his contacts with Republican members of Congress and other matters not covered by executive privilege or attorney-client privilege as part of a cooperation deal that his lawyer had been negotiating for months, the sources said. The former attorney to the president had also indicated to the select committee that he was prepared to turn over materials about Trump’s schemes to return himself to office on January 6 that House investigators had outlined in a subpoena issued earlier this year. But, as the Guardian first reported in February, Giuliani told the panel he would only appear for an interview if it was not pursuant to that subpoena – in part because he considered the investigation illegal – and does not have to violate any claims of privilege. The select committee has conceded that Giuliani cannot violate privilege, the sources said, making a deal attractive to Giuliani, who can avoid being held in contempt of Congress by providing information the panel could not otherwise get – while also not giving up Trump. But that delicate arrangement appeared to fall apart on Thursday, after Giuliani also asked to record the interview to ensure he might not be caught in a perjury trap in a potential subsequent investigation, according to another source close to Giuliani. The no-show by Giuliani could also presage the breakdown of the entire cooperation deal, the source said, and Giuliani is expected to wait for the panel’s response to decide next steps. Giuliani may reschedule the interview if the impasse is resolved. “Giuliani is an important witness to the conspiracy to overthrow the government and he remains under subpoena,” a spokesperson for the select committee said. “If he refuses to comply, the committee will consider all enforcement options.” House investigators have been particularly determined to get the cooperation from Giuliani, one of Trump’s closest advisers involved in efforts to overturn the 2020 election from the very start – and could provide unique insights into the events of January 6. Giuliani could speak to events such as a 18 December 2020 meeting in the Oval Office where Trump reviewed a draft executive order to seize voting machines and verbally agreed to install conspiracy theorist Sidney Powell as special counsel to investigate election fraud.The Guardian has reported that Giuliani then led the Trump “war room” at the Willard hotel in Washington DC when Trump called from the White House and discussed ways to stop Biden’s certification – and could speak to non-privileged elements of the plan.The cooperation deal would also technically involve Giuliani turning over documents in addition to appearing before the select committee, the sources said, but the logistics were unclear given the FBI last year seized his devices that he used on January 6.",News/US news,Rudy Giuliani backs out of interview with Capitol attack committee,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/05/rudy-giuliani-house-january-6-committee-interview-donald-trump
