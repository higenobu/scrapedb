2/25/2022,"Referring to the Russia-Ukraine Crisis, Trump praised Putin as a “genius” and stated that “China is going to be next” under Biden’s watch.

In a recent interview with the conservative talk radio program “The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show,” former U.S. President Donald Trump confidently stated that “China is going to be next” and would “absolutely” be going after Taiwan.

He accused the Biden administration of being weak and assured the hosts that an invasion would “never have happened” under his own presidency. Trump also praised Putin as a “genius” for sending Russian troops into Ukraine under the guise of “peace keepers.” He stated, “Here’s a guy who’s very savvy.”

The hosts mocked President Joe Biden’s tweets from two years ago in which he wrote: “I’m the only person in this field who’s ever gone toe-to-toe with [Putin].” They claimed Russian invasions also took place under the Obama administration, suggesting the two leaders had weak positions on foreign policy.

As president, Trump was involved and invested in several Taiwanese affairs, especially in regards to military expansion. As an NPR article from 2020 pointed out, Trump made many efforts as president to forge a stronger partnership with Taiwan, including accepting a congratulatory call from Taiwan’s president on his win and dealing a multi-billion dollar arms sale with the Taiwanese military. Under his administration, a brand new $255 million dollar representative office was also opened in Taipei, the capital. Simultaneously during this time, Trump had continued to take an aggressive stance against trade with China by imposing tariffs.

China and Taiwan have had separate governments since 1949, when communists overtook the Republic of China in a civil war. They went on to set up the People’s Republic of China, whereas the members of the Republic of China fled to Taiwan to establish their own separate government. Taiwan continues to declare its independence, while China continues to claim it as its territory under its “One country, two systems” stance.

In response to comparisons of the Russia-Ukraine Crisis to the situation between China and Taiwan, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hya Chunying firmly reiterated China’s “One-China” sentiments by noting that “Taiwan is indeed not Ukraine” and would always remain an “inseparable” part of China’s territory. “This,” Hya continued, “is an irrefutable historical and legal fact.”

Tensions are on the rise as Taiwan’s need for military defense comes into question amidst an already strained relationship between it and China. China’s air force has been spotted circling Taiwan’s skies.

Naomi Osaka just posted a new selfie to her Instagram Stories and her grid—and I gotta say, her legs look beyond sculpted. The tennis star, 24, threw up a peace sign in the mirror as she posed in a colorful patterned windbreaker that she paired with an orange cap, pink sneakers, and shorts. She captioned the story, ""Why is it so cold? ):"" Considering Naomi's already won four Grand Slam singles championships, it's no surprise she looks so strong. And while most people know her for her tennis skills, Naomi actually does a lot off the court to stay fit. Here's everything to know: In 2021, she told Us Weekly that she trains at the tennis court for three hours every day with her coach Jermaine Jenkins. “I love my time on the court,” Naomi said. “My morning practices alternate between groundstrokes, cardio, and footwork drills.” A three-hour workout seems pretty intense, but luckily, Naomi puts a lot of focus on recovering. She's a big fan of using a massage gun to ease any tension in her muscles. “After my hard training session, I use my Hyperice Hypervolt,” she added. “My physical therapist, Natsuko Mogi, always makes sure I recover well and keep my body healthy.”
 And to keep her energy levels high throughout the day, Naomi relies on smoothies to keep herself going. In an interview with Mind Body Green, she revealed that she reaches for fruit smoothies before she hits the courts and opts for veggie-based smoothies afterward. ""For my post-workout smoothie, I tend to use more vegetables compared to fruits in my pre-workout option,"" she said. ""Adding a spice like ginger gives it some good flavor too. Overall, this one helps me recover and cool down from my toughest of workouts."" To end her day with a meal that's high in protein, Naomi eats smoked salmon and avocado toast.
