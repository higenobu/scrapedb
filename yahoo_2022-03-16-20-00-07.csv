3/16/2022,"For the second time in two weeks, a large group of Haitian migrants has come to shore in the Florida Keys. Monroe County Sheriff Rick Ramsay said 100 to 150 people arrived in a sailboat Monday morning off Summerland Key, about 20 miles from Key West. Photos provided by the sheriff’s office show a large group of people gathering in the yard of an oceanfront home on Summerland Key. It is unclear whether the boat came directly from Haiti or elsewhere in the Caribbean. But last week, a source in Haiti who monitors maritime migrant operations told the Miami Herald that two boats had left the country’s northwest coast on Tuesday and more were scheduled to leave over the weekend. All were bound for the Florida shorelines, the source said. Read more: New trafficking routes bring migrants to Ocean Reef resort, other Keys spots In addition to Florida, they are also arriving in Puerto Rico. U.S. Customs and Border Patrol in the U.S. territory has processed 571 Haitians since October. The majority of them are landing on Mona Island, followed by mainland Puerto Rico. “When we look at the migration map there is always a peak at high levels of political instability and grave human rights abuses in Haiti,” said Marleine Bastien, a Haitian advocate and founder of Family Action Network Movement in Miami. “It never fails.” Bastien said the boats will keep coming as long as conditions in her crises-wracked homeland continue to deteriorate. “Haitians are at war. They are under constant assault, and the reason why we haven’t seen a greater amount of people fleeing for their lives is because our people have a lot of courage, they are used to misery,” she said. “We are a people of resilience, people who have been dealing with it so long and we have the highest capacity to endure.” Prior to Monday’s landing, four overloaded rickety boats arrived in the Florida Keys from Haiti since November, ferrying nearly 700 Haitians trying to escape worsening conditions. While the Keys are a common landing spot for Cuban migrants, whose numbers are also on the rise, the island chain has not been a frequent end point for Haitians. But their arrival there suggests that human smugglers are becoming better organized and sophisticated in their methods as they seek to reach U.S. soil. The fact that they’re ending up in the Keys also points to new migration routes, likely using the coastlines and territorial waters of Cuba en route to South Florida in order to evade U.S. Coast Guard cutters stationed between the U.S. and Haiti. The Keys are just 90 miles from Cuba. Already in the throes of deepening political, economic, humanitarian and gang crises prior to last July’s assassination of President Jovenel Moïse, Haiti is seeing conditions worsen. Five weeks after Moïse’s killing, a magnitude 7.2 earthquake struck the country’s southern peninsula and left more than 2,000 dead. A rising tide in gang violence and ongoing political instability have made it difficult to provide assistance, as well as improve security and the economic situation throughout the country. On the same day that the migrants arrived in the Lower Keys on Monday, doctors throughout Haiti began the first of a three-day work stoppage to protest the March 2 kidnapping of two of their colleagues. Urologist Pierre Boncy and obstetrician-gynecologist Michel D’Alexis were grabbed from inside their medical practice in Port-au-Prince by armed people wearing Haiti National Police uniforms, and remain captive nearly two weeks later. The strike was launched by the Haitian Medical Association and other health professionals, who are demanding that the interim government led by a fellow physician and neurologist, Prime Minister Ariel Henry, take measures to restore security in the country. The strike’s announcement came on the heels of another work stoppage, this one by the State University of Haiti after the recent assassination of one of its professors, Jacques Faubert Etienne. Last week, a U.S. Coast Guard cutter arrived back in the northern Haitian city of Cap-Haïtien with 198 repatriated Haitian migrants. Those disembarking repeatedly cited gang-related violence and kidnapping as the reasons behind their decision to flee, as well as the lack of job opportunities in the country. The group was among 356 people who arrived from Haiti on March 6 in a cargo freighter that ran aground off Ocean Reef Club, a gated community and resort in Key Largo in the Upper Keys; 158 migrants dropped into the ocean and swam about 200 yards to shore. Late last week, they were being screened for credible fear that might lead to successful asylum claims, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. However, their current location remains unclear. During a protest Saturday, Haitian and immigration advocates gathered in the rain outside of a Border Patrol office in Dania Beach demanding access to the migrants in order to alert them about their rights. Their pleas, however, went unheard. The office was closed, and the migrants’ whereabouts remain unknown. “People are desperate for answers,” said Bastien, one of the organizers of the protest. Bastien said family members have flooded her phone lines seeking answers about loved ones who they believe were traveling on the boat. Unlike in years past when arriving Haitian migrants were sent to the Krome Detention Center in South Miami-Dade County or the Broward Transitional Center, detained Haitian migrants are being distributed to detention centers around the country, some as far away as Texas. In order to track them, individuals need to have their names.

3/16/2022,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — U.S. astronaut Mark Vande Hei has made it through nearly a year in space, but faces what could be his trickiest assignment yet: riding a Russian capsule back to Earth in the midst of deepening tensions between the countries. NASA insists Vande Hei’s homecoming plans at the end of the month remain unchanged, even as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has resulted in canceled launches, broken contracts and an escalating war of words by the Russian Space Agency’s hardline leader. Many worry Dmitry Rogozin is putting decades of a peaceful off-the-planet partnership at risk, most notably at the International Space Station. Vande Hei — who on Tuesday breaks the U.S. single spaceflight record of 340 days — is due to leave with two Russians aboard a Soyuz capsule for a touchdown in Kazakhstan on March 30. The astronaut will have logged 355 days in space by then, setting a new U.S. record. The world record of 438 continuous days in space belongs to Russia. Retired NASA astronaut Scott Kelly, America’s record-holder until Tuesday, is among those sparring with Rogozin, a longtime ally of Vladimir Putin. Enraged by what's going on in Ukraine, Kelly has returned his Russian medal for space exploration to the Russian Embassy in Washington. Despite the deadly conflict down here, Kelly believes the two sides “can hold it together” up in space. “We need an example set that two countries that historically have not been on the most friendly of terms, can still work somewhere peacefully. And that somewhere is the International Space Station. That’s why we need to fight to keep it,” Kelly told The Associated Press. NASA wants to keep the space station running until 2030, as do the European, Japanese and Canadian space agencies, while the Russians have not committed beyond the original end date of 2024 or so. The U.S. and Russia are the prime operators of the orbiting outpost, permanently occupied for 21 years. Until SpaceX started launching astronauts in 2020, Americans regularly hitched rides on Russian Soyuz capsules for tens of millions of dollars per seat. The U.S. and Russian space agencies are still working on a long-term barter system in which a Russian would launch on a SpaceX capsule beginning this fall and an American would fly up on the Soyuz. That would help ensure a U.S. and Russian station presence at all times. Vande Hei, 55, a retired Army colonel, moved into the space station last April, launching on a Soyuz from Kazakhstan with Pyotr Dubrov and another Russian. He and Dubrov stayed twice as long as usual to accommodate a Russian film crew that visited in October. As the situation 260 miles (420 kilometers) below intensified last month, Vande Hei acknowledged he was avoiding conversations about Ukraine with Dubrov and Anton Shkaplerov, their Russian commander. Three more Russians will blast off from Kazakhstan on Friday to replace them. “We haven’t talked about that too much. I’m not sure we really want to go there,” Vande Hei told a TV interviewer in mid-February. Space station operations continue as always — in orbit and on Earth, according to NASA. “It would be a sad day for international operations if we can’t continue to peacefully operate in space,” said NASA’s human spaceflight chief Kathy Lueders, who noted it would be “very difficult” to go it alone. To mark Tuesday’s milestone, NASA turned to Twitter to gather questions for video-recorded responses, and some asked whether Vande Hei might switch to an American ride home. SpaceX is taking three wealthy businessmen and their ex-astronaut escort to the space station at the end of March for a brief visit. Then in mid-April, SpaceX will deliver four astronauts for NASA before bringing back four who have been on board since November. NASA’s space station program manager Joel Montalbano, during a press briefing Monday, said Russia's space agency has confirmed that they're ready to bring all three back — Vande Hei and the two Russians. A NASA plane and small team will be on hand in Kazakhstan, as usual, to whisk Vande Hei back home to Houston. Former NASA astronaut Heidemarie Stefanyshyn-Piper, whose father was born in Ukraine, concedes it’s a difficult situation. “We’re sanctioning Russia. Companies are pulling out of doing business in Russia. But then yet you still have the U.S. government — the space agency — doing business with the Russians,” she said. “You can’t push a button and separate the two” sides of the space station. Besides threatening to pull out of the space station and drop it on the U.S., Europe or elsewhere, Rogozin had the flags of other countries covered on a Soyuz rocket awaiting liftoff with internet satellites earlier this month. The launch was called off, after the customer, London-based OneWeb, refused his demands that the satellites not be used for military purposes and the British government halt its financial backing. The European Space Agency also is reeling. After missing a 2020 launch deadline for its Mars rover — a joint European-Russian effort — the project was on track for a September liftoff from Kazakhstan. Now it’s most likely off until 2024, the next opportunity for Earth and Mars to be properly aligned. And Russia has pulled its staff out of the French-run launch site in South America, suspending Soyuz launches of European satellites. All this comes on top of the Russian government's antisatellite missile test in November that added countless pieces of junk to the debris already encircling Earth and put the space station's four Americans, two Russians and one German on alert for days. Jeffrey Manber, now with the private Voyager Space company, helped forge U.S. and Russian ties back in the mid-1990s, with the first piece of the space station launching in 1998. He sees the outpost as “one of the final holdouts of collaboration” between the two countries. But, he added, “there is no going back if the partnership is ended and the result is a premature ending of the ISS program.” Regardless of how things play out at the space station, John Logsdon, professor emeritus at George Washington University, expects it will mark the end of large-scale space cooperation between Russia and the West. “Russia has been moving toward China already, and the current situation will probably accelerate that move,” he said. While Vande Hei has been silent on Twitter, Kelly and others have gone into overdrive, taking offense at Rogozin's threats. Elon Musk's private SpaceX took a swipe at Rogozin after he said Russia would stop supplying rocket engines to U.S. companies — Northrop Grumman and United Launch Alliance — adding they could use broomsticks to get to orbit. At a launch last week, a SpaceX official responded: “Time to let the American broomstick fly and hear the sounds of freedom.” ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

3/16/2022,"By Patricia Zengerle WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Forty-nine of the 50 Republican U.S. senators said on Monday they will not back an emerging new nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, underscoring their party's opposition to attempts to revive a 2015 accord amid fears talks might collapse. Citing press reports about a new deal, which has yet to be finalized and could be torpedoed by Russian opposition, the lawmakers said in a statement that Democratic President Joe Biden's administration might reach a deal to weaken sanctions and lessen restrictions on Iran's nuclear program. They pledged to do everything in their power to reverse an agreement that does not ""completely block"" Iran's ability to develop a nuclear weapon, constrain its ballistic missile program and ""confront Iran's support for terrorism."" Tehran denies it has ever sought atomic bombs. Senator Rand Paul was the only Republican member of the Senate who did not sign Monday's statement. In an emailed statement, he said: “Condemning a deal that is not yet formulated is akin to condemning diplomacy itself, not a very thoughtful position."" No congressional Republicans supported the 2015 nuclear agreement between Tehran and major powers, reached under Democratic President Barack Obama, which curbed Iran's uranium enrichment program in exchange for a lifting of international sanctions against Tehran. A handful of Democrats also objected. The 2015 Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (INARA) gives Congress the right to review an agreement, but lawmakers are unlikely to be able to kill a deal outright after failing to do so in 2015 when Republicans controlled Congress. Democrats now hold slim majorities in both the House of Representatives and Senate and are unlikely to turn against Biden in sufficient numbers to stop a major initiative like an Iran deal. The 2015 accord made it harder for Tehran to develop material for nuclear weapons. It fell apart after Republican President Donald Trump withdrew the United States in 2018. Talks resumed after Biden became president last year. Attempts to clinch a new deal were left in limbo after a last-minute demand by Russia - at odds with the West over its invasion of Ukraine - forced the powers to pause talks in Vienna despite having a largely completed text. A spokesperson for Iran's foreign ministry said on Monday that Washington needed to make a decision to wrap up a deal.

3/16/2022,"In a recent study published in Scientific Reports, researchers found that breaking up spring break into small breaks instead of the traditional nine-day vacation can help reduce COVID-19 cases on campus by 2% to 37% when students return. To learn more, The Conversation reached out to Naveen K. Vaidya, a co-author of the study and an expert in mathematical modeling, to predict how infectious diseases spread and to get his take on whether a traditional spring break this year will be safe. What happened in 2021 at colleges that offered a regular spring break? Many of them had surges after spring break, but the levels varied. The size of the surge depended on several variables. One of the most important factors was how many students from campus traveled and, if so, whether they went to a destination with a high prevalence of COVID-19 cases. But data from spring 2021 only offers limited insight because most universities offered online or hybrid classes at the time, so not all colleges had students returning from spring break to campus. Plus, many implemented post spring-break protocols, such as two-week quarantines and mandatory regular testing. The first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine had begun to be administered before spring break last year. Also, the delta variant, which significantly affected younger people, was already circulating in other places in the world and was about to surface in the U.S. Some schools canceled the traditional spring breaks, and some attempted to curb the expected bump in COVID-19 cases when students returned to campus. For example, the University of California at Berkeley required students who lived on campus to quarantine for 10 days after spring break. The University of California, Davis reduced student travel by offering a $75 gift card to students to have a “staycation” on campus during spring break. About 2,500 students took the university up on its offer. Post-spring break surges were reported on college campuses in states such as Florida, Indiana, Michigan and New York. Is spring break safe for this year? We don’t know. Spring break itself is not the problem, but it can become problematic based on other variables, such as how many students travel and whether they go places where there is a relatively high prevalence of COVID-19 cases. Based on those variables and our model simulations, breaking up spring break into shorter breaks instead of the regular nine-day break could reduce COVID-19 cases between 2% and 37%. However, the actual percentage will likely be influenced by the presence of the more transmissible omicron variant and by the fact that many more people are vaccinated than at this time last year. What kinds of destinations should students avoid? If students travel, they should consider going to places where the prevalence of COVID-19 cases is relatively low and the portion of people who are vaccinated is relatively high. People can check with government websites or other sources, such as the Johns Hopkins University & Medicine’s Coronavirus Resource Center, to see the status of vaccination rates in a particular place. A vacation plan with more outdoor activities will be beneficial because the virus is less likely to be transmitted outdoors. Coming into contact with fewer people and wearing masks during travel can also help reduce exposure to COVID-19. Do you expect COVID-19 cases to spike at campuses when students return? Yes, that is what is predicted by our model and what many universities experienced last year. However, it should be noted that students might have already been vaccinated, probably even with a booster, as mandated by many universities, which can also lessen the spread of the coronavirus. Also, two years of the pandemic, to some extent, might have taught people to observe safer practices when they are in a crowd, such as keeping their distance from people, wearing a mask properly and washing their hands frequently. While some spikes of COVID-19 are expected following spring break, policy changes by colleges, such as incentives for students who avoid travel, sending frequent emails reminding students to wear a mask and reduce contacts, and a few days of quarantine with frequent testing upon return, may help curtail potential surges.

3/16/2022,"Israel appears to be recovering from a large-scale cyberattack. According to Haaretz and Kan's Amichai Stein, attackers took down several Israeli government websites on Monday evening, including those for the ministries of health, interior, justice and welfare. The Prime Minister's Office website was also affected. All of the websites are back online, the country's National Cyber Directorate said in a statement. The government hasn't officially identified a likely perpetrator, but it did say the sites were victims of a denial of service attack that flooded them with traffic. Haaretz sources claimed the cyberattack targeted sites with a gov.il domain, and suspected that either a state actor or a ""large organization"" was responsible. DW notes an Iran-linked hacker group supposedly took credit, and that this may have been retaliation for an alleged Israeli operation against an Iranian nuclear facility. Neither has been confirmed, however. It's unclear whether or not this is the largest cyberattack against Israel to date, as a defense source told Haaretz. However, the NCF and defense officials were reportedly concerned enough to declare a state of emergency and review the possible damage, including anything that might compromise other key websites and critical infrastructure. In contrast to the assaults that hobbled Ukrainian government websites ahead of Russia's invasion, the denial of service attacks here are unlikely to have done much damage. They made it difficult to reach the websites, but there's no evidence the culprits defaced sites or compromised data. Still, the cyberattack may exacerbate an already tense situation — it comes just a day after Iran fired missiles at the Iraqi city of Erbil in an apparent warning to the US and its allies.

3/16/2022,"Since the iPhone 5c, Apple’s approach to making a more affordable iPhone has been to stuff premium processors into cases belonging to older models. With the third generation of the iPhone SE, the company has stuck to that strategy. With its home button, top and bottom bezels and rounded corners, the new iPhone SE is nearly identical to the 2020 model, at least on the outside. Inside, this year’s version packs an A15 Bionic chip and a 5G radio, promising a serious speed boost. Apple is also touting longer battery life and improved durability on this year’s model, which will set you back a modest $429. That’s $30 more than the last iPhone SE, but still cheaper than the $450 Pixel 5a. If you want a simple iPhone that runs like new, and you don’t mind the dated design and single rear camera, the iPhone SE might fit the bill. At a time when basically all smartphones have done away with home buttons, this year’s iPhone SE feels anachronistic. Its home button sits in a bezel below the screen, while the top bezel hides the device’s front camera. If you’re familiar with the last iPhone SE, then you’ll know what to expect: This year’s model is so similar that I legit have trouble telling them apart. The only way I know which one I’m holding is if I scrutinize the phone’s rear casing under a fluorescent light. The review unit Apple sent this year is a dark blue, while the 2020 iPhone SE in my possession is black. Oh, and, according to the specs sheets, the new SE is a whole four grams lighter. Considering the earlier model already looked outdated, the latest iPhone feels very much stuck in the past. Still, in spite of its stodgy design, I like the way the SE feels. It’s very similar to the Pixel 3: slim, slightly curved and solidly built. The iPhone 13 mini is a little smaller and thicker, with flatter edges and a notch at the top of its 5.4-inch screen that houses its front camera. If you hate notches but for some reason don’t mind bezels, the iPhone SE’s retro look is for you. The iPhone SE (2022) held up in mid-air, with office desks and chairs in the background. More importantly, Apple says the iPhone SE is covered in the same hardy glass used on the iPhone 13. While I have yet to drop my review unit, knowing that this will be more scratch resistant offers some peace of mind. I don’t use a case with the iPhone 13, and it’s still pristine, despite having been tossed into bags with keys and other sharp objects. It does pick up fingerprints and smudges very easily, though. It’s also nice that the iPhone SE is rated IP67 for dust and water resistance — something the Galaxy A52 5G and the Pixel 5a also offer. Like many phones from 2017, this year’s iPhone SE sports a 4.7-inch LCD screen with 1,334 x 750 resolution. Honestly, those specs are downright tragic for 2022 standards, by which OLEDs have become commonplace. Don’t even get me started on the refresh rate. The Galaxy A52 has a 6.5-inch Super AMOLED running at 120Hz, while the Pixel 5a’s OLED panel at least refreshes at 90Hz. I used four phones – the iPhone SE, its predecessor, the iPhone 13 mini and the Pixel 5a – to watch a recap of the Apple event on YouTube concurrently on each device at max brightness. The iPhone 13 mini was the brightest, followed by the Pixel. The iPhone SEs were indistinguishable from each other and had a reddish tint compared to the other two. It’s not going to wow you, but the iPhone SE’s display is serviceable. I watched the beginning of The Problem with Jon Stewart on the TV+ app, and though everything looked somewhat muted compared to the OLEDs I’m used to, the show still looked fine. You’ll definitely want to push the screen to max brightness to watch videos outdoors in the sun, though. Despite its small size, the iPhone SE’s speakers are surprisingly loud. I enjoyed listening to the tap-dancing sequence in a video of a performance of Anything Goes, as well as Sutton Foster’s ample vocals. The iPhone SE’s biggest disadvantage in the mid-range space is its cameras. It has just one rear 12-megapixel sensor with an f/1.8 aperture, while most of the competition come with at least two, making them more versatile shooting rigs. But if you’re content with a solo camera, the iPhone SE 2022 will suffice. It takes surprisingly sharp and colorful photos that are on par with the iPhone 13 mini’s. Ornaments on the red brick facade of a local building looked equally crisp when shot on either phone, even when I zoomed all the way in. It’s clear that with the A15 Bionic and processing upgrades like Smart HDR 4, Apple’s been able to make the iPhone SE’s camera perform as well as the main sensor on its flagship. The Pixel 5a generally produced darker images with cooler, more neutral tones in its images, and though I’m not a fan of Apple’s default treatment, which has a slightly yellowish tinge, you do have the ability to change that. The company introduced Photographic Styles with the iPhone 13 series, which lets you adjust preset profiles for contrast and tone. Every picture you capture will use those settings (until you pick a different style). Happily, the new iPhone SE also offers Photographic Styles, so you can exercise a bit more control over how your shots turn out. I was surprised by how similar the iPhone SE’s pictures were to the iPhone 13 mini’s. From landscapes to portraits of my coworkers, there were barely any differences in the shots taken by the two phones. The Pixel 5a was better at isolating our video producer’s spiky hair from the background than either iPhone, but all three devices performed admirably. A sample photo from the iPhone SE (2022) featuring a skyscraper at night. Our main complaint about the last iPhone SE’s camera was that there was no Night mode. This year’s model still doesn’t offer one, and though some of the pictures I took of buildings surrounded by mist one night came out muddy, others came out bright and sharp. It’s likely that my shivering hands contributed to the blur, but in general, Google retains an advantage in low light. Up front, the iPhone SE’s 7-MP camera also falls short of the competition on paper, but in reality it performed just as well as the Pixel 5a and iPhone 13 mini. It struggled to keep up in dim environments, though; I observed a more noticeable difference in the selfies I shot inside a stationary car one night. The iPhone SE’s photos weren’t as clean as the others, but they were still good enough to share. Synthetic benchmarks don’t paint the most complete picture of a phone’s performance, but in a pinch they’re a good point of reference. The iPhone SE’s Geekbench 5 scores blew away the Galaxy S22 series, and even came close to matching the iPhone 13 Pro. That makes sense, given Apple equipped its budget phone with the same powerful A15 Bionic chip found in its flagship series. In everyday use, the A15 Bionic was powerful enough for most of my tasks, including editing and exporting a minute-long video in iMovie and using the camera’s Live Text feature to scan product labels around me. I did notice some delays while setting up the phone, with a noticeable pause from when I tapped “Continue” to when the next page came up. I also couldn’t screen record while using SharePlay on a FaceTime video call to show my home page to my colleague which, according to an alert, was a buffering issue. Apple also doesn't allow you to record your screen while SharePlaying, which I wish was what the notification explained instead. But everything else ran smoothly. The iPhone SE did get a little warm while I ran tests and used the camera’s Live Text feature to scan addresses on a bottle and look them up in Maps. Thankfully, it cooled back down quickly. As someone who’s grown accustomed to gesture-based navigation, I needed to reacquaint myself with using a home key. It doesn’t physically depress; like on the previous iPhone SE this is a touch sensor that vibrates in response when you push it. That said, as strange as it felt to navigate iOS with a home button, I did welcome the convenience of Touch ID. Unlocking the phone was a breeze, too, and if you’re familiar with the last iPhone SE’s sensor you’ll be used to this, especially since the hardware is exactly the same. In fact, if you’ve never known life without the button below the screen and don’t want to give it up, this is the only modern phone around with it. One area where small devices like the iPhone SE and iPhone 13 mini tend to fall short is battery life. Apple promised that the A15 Bionic would bring better endurance to this year’s iPhone SE, which turned out to be true. While it did outlast its predecessor, the latest iPhone SE made it just about 12 hours on our video rundown battery test. The iPhone 13 mini clocked a few hours more, while the Pixel 5a notched an impressive 22 hours and 56 minutes. In daily use, the new iPhone SE typically lasted about a day before needing a charge. I spent one morning and afternoon testing its camera and display, and by 6pm it had dropped to 46 percent. At about 9pm it had fallen to 37 percent, and I hadn’t done much besides taking nighttime photos. The iPhone SE definitely won’t survive your after-work nights out. I do appreciate that, in addition to the Lightning port, the iPhone SE charges wirelessly. It also supports sub-6 5G, and can work with midband networks as well. Those hoping for ultrawideband for more precise AirTag locations will be disappointed; Apple didn’t include it here. mmWave 5G is also a missing feature, though with the lack of widely available reliable coverage, that’s more understandable. If you’re considering the iPhone SE, you’ve probably already decided Android isn’t for you. But I feel it’s my duty to tell you that in this price range, non-Apple offerings tend to offer better specs. Sure, the A15 bionic is the most powerful chip you're going to get at this price, but nowadays most mid-range phones come with competent processors. You probably won’t notice a huge difference in daily performance between the iPhone SE and the Pixel 5a, which uses a Snapdragon 765G. What you’re likely to miss out on by sticking to Apple is beautiful OLED panels with faster screen refresh rates. The Pixel 5a and Galaxy A52 also come with multi-camera systems that will make shooting landscapes or faraway objects easier. But if you’d rather stick to a familiar ecosystem, or if the person who you’re buying this for doesn’t need those things, the iPhone SE is a safe choice. Apple currently still sells the iPhone 11 for $500, so if you have about $70 more to spend it’s worth considering while it’s available. You’ll lose 5G and the home button, and get an A13 chip instead of the A15. But the iPhone 11 also offers longer battery life and a second ultra-wide camera. If you’re in the market for a small, cheaper iPhone, you’ve probably also got your eye on the iPhone 13 mini. For about $270 more, it brings a nicer, fullscreen display, additional rear camera, updated design and slightly longer battery life. You’ll have to finally let go of the home button and Touch ID, sure, and get used to a notch for the selfie camera. But those are fairly minor tradeoffs. I do want to point out that the base model’s 64GB of storage is measly. I’ve barely installed all my apps on my review unit and there’s already about 22GB gone. You’ll definitely want to spend the extra $50 for the 128GB version at least, which is what the entry-level iPhone 13 mini includes. For the price, the iPhone SE offers many advanced features, like a premium processor, 5G support and iOS 15. With these, Apple’s mid-range phone is likely to keep running respectably for at least two more years. But some of its other aspects are practically ancient, like its cramped screen and limited camera setup. If you’re hellbent on getting an iPhone for under $500, and don’t want a refurbished version of previous flagships, the iPhone SE is good enough. Plus, this is the only iPhone around that still has Touch ID, which many people prefer over Face ID. Those who want superior cameras and displays, though, should at least consider the Galaxy A52 or the iPhone 13. If you can wait a little longer and don’t mind Android, there’s also a chance Google’s next mid-range Pixel will be a better deal. For now, it’s nice to see a new iPhone SE that brings modern performance and connectivity in a design that fans of smaller phones will enjoy. It’s basic, but it gets the job done.

3/16/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve on Wednesday will launch one of the most difficult tasks a central bank can attempt: Raise borrowing costs enough to slow growth and tame high inflation, but not so much as to topple the economy into recession. With a war raging in Europe and price increases at a four-decade high, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will seek to engineer a “soft landing”: A gradual slowdown in economic activity that helps curb surging prices, while keeping the job market and economy expanding. Yet many economists worry that with the price of gas and commodities spiking, the additional burden of higher interest rates could choke off growth entirely. “You’ve got to be both lucky and good” to avoid causing a downturn, said Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economist who served as vice chair of the Fed from 1994 to 1996, when the central bank was widely seen as achieving a soft landing. As a first step, the Fed is set to raise borrowing rates several times this year, beginning this week with a quarter-point increase in its benchmark short-term rate. Policymakers will also discuss when and how fast to shrink the Fed’s $9 trillion in bond holdings, a step that would also have the effect of tightening credit for consumers and businesses. Such moves mark a sharp turn away from the Fed's ultra-low-rate policies, which it enacted when the pandemic recession erupted two years ago. By pinning its key rate near zero for two years and buying trillions in bonds, the Fed has kept borrowing costs at historically low levels and helped boost stock prices. The Fed, by its own admission, underestimated the breadth and persistence of high inflation after the pandemic struck. Many economists say the central bank made its task riskier by waiting too long to begin raising rates. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate, which reached a record low of 2.65% in January 2021, has jumped to 3.85% in the past three months, as Powell has signaled the Fed's intentions and inflation has spiraled higher. By raising short-term rates, the Fed hopes to make it costlier to buy homes and cars and to boost credit card rates and borrowing costs for businesses. The resulting pullback in spending should, in turn, slow inflation, Powell told Congress two weeks ago. Strong consumer spending, fueled by stimulus checks and steady hiring and pay raises, has collided with supply shortfalls to raise inflation to 7.9%, the highest rate since 1982. “People will spend less, and what we hope to achieve is bringing the economy to a level where demand and supply are in sync,” Powell  said at a Senate Banking Committee hearing. If the Fed succeeds, he said, the economy should keep growing, and unemployment, over time, should stay low — it's now 3.8% — or fall further. “I think it’s more likely than not that we can achieve what we call a soft landing,” Powell told a House panel a day before his Senate testimony. Yet the Fed faces a dizzying array of uncertainties that will make its task particularly challenging. The economy is still working through shortages of labor and parts stemming from the disruptions of the pandemic. And now prices are rising further for oil, gas, wheat, and other commodities because of Russia's war against Ukraine. The clearest soft landing was achieved in 1994 and 1995, when the Fed under Chairman Alan Greenspan raised its benchmark rate from 3% to 6% as the economy was rebounding after a brief recession. Inflation, which wasn't a problem then, declined further. And unemployment leveled off at about 5.5% before resuming its decline two years later. Blinder calculates that the Fed also engineered soft landings in 1965 and 1983. But he worries that this time, the odds are stacked against the Fed and that its rate hikes may end up causing an economic setback. “It's just so hard in this environment,” he said. “You have to have a world in which nothing comes to knock over the apple cart. And for Jay Powell and the Fed, the whole world is just apple cart after apple cart getting knocked over.” One of those apple carts is the sharp rise in gas prices since the invasion, up 65 cents to $4.33 a gallon, on average, nationwide. The increase will send inflation higher, while probably also slowing growth — two conflicting trends that are difficult for the Fed to manage simultaneously. Last week, Goldman Sachs cut its growth forecast for this year to 2.9%, down from a previous estimate of 3.1%. Others foresee growth decelerating to 2%, down from 5.7% last year. The economy's steady expansion does provide some cushion against higher rates and more expensive gas. Consumers are spending at a healthy pace, and employers keep rapidly hiring. There are still 11.3 million job openings, far outnumbering the unemployed. In 1998, the late MIT economist Rudiger Dornbusch wrote that economic expansions didn't die of “natural causes."" Rather, he said, ""they were all murdered by the Fed over the issue of inflation.” He meant that the Fed raised rates too much out of fear of inflation and failed to achieve a soft landing. Yet many economists say that view is outdated and refers mostly to Fed policies from the 1950s through early 1980s. The Fed now operates differently. It communicates its plans more clearly with the public. And it pays closer attention to factors such as inflation expectations, which measure where consumers, businesses and investors see inflation heading. Such measures are important because if people think inflation will head higher, they will demand bigger paychecks. Companies, in turn, will raise prices further to offset their higher labor costs. Inflation expectations, particularly in the short-term, have been rising steadily, though longer-term measures suggest that people still expect inflation to return closer to the Fed's 2% annual target over time. Emi Nakamura, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, noted that in the 1970s, even as inflation soared, it was still a matter of debate among economists whether the Fed's rate policies could truly control inflation. Yet if the Fed keeps raising rates for another year or two, as many economists expect, it could eventually lift them high enough that consumers and business reduce spending and throw the economy into reverse. Unemployment would rise and a downturn could begin. Stephen Stanley, an economist at Amherst Pierpont, suggested, though, that the Fed won't reach that possibility until next year or later. “Let’s at least get a few rate hikes under our belt before we start worrying about that,” he said. “We have some distance to go before that becomes a realistic worry.”",Business/Associated Press,Federal Reserve to begin risky pursuit of a 'soft landing',https://news.yahoo.com/federal-begin-risky-pursuit-soft-150527349.html

3/16/2022,"The besieged city of Mariupol is suffering such a devastating toll that street cleaners are collecting the bodies of civilians killed during the Russian onslaught, the city's deputy mayor has said. The city, situated in the south-west of Ukraine, has found itself at the centre of the invasion, with 2,500 residents reportedly killed as a result of the Russian invasion. ""We can't bury [the victims] in private graves, as those are outside the city and the perimeter is controlled by Russian troops,"" Mariupol's deputy mayor Serhiy Orlov told the BBC. Heavy Russian shelling has prevented any mass evacuation from the besieged port city, despite efforts to open safe routes for civilians to escape through. Promised ceasefires have been routinely broken by Russian troops. On Sunday, the city council said the civilian death toll had reached 2,100. By Monday, presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said that figure had risen to 2,500. Orlov said he could not give a total for dead civilians buried in mass graves, but that 67 bodies were at one site. ""Some we can't identify but some had documents,"" he said, and then went on to reveal that the situation was so dire street cleaners and road repair teams were having to collect bodies in the streets because municipal services have collapsed. He added: ""Some people were killed during those collections. We've had no electricity, or heating, sanitation, water, food for 11 days."" Orlov said that thousands of residents are hiding in cellars beneath the city, and some are burying family members privately in courtyards or gardens. In a video message on Saturday, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the families of the 79 children killed in the war “had been destroyed’’. Watch: Drone footage shows destruction to the city of Mariupol Zelensky emphasized the plight of Mariupol, a port city of 430,000, which is surrounded by Russian troops. “They are bombing it 24 hours a day, launching missiles"" he said. Recalling the destruction of a maternity hospital in the city last Wednesday, he said: “It is hatred. They kill children. They destroy maternity hospitals. They destroy hospitals, why? So Ukraine has no more children.” On Monday it was announced that a pregnant woman who had been pictured clasping her bloodstained stomach as paramedics carried her through the wreckage of the hospital after the bomb attack, had died. According to the Associated Press news agency, the woman was rushed to another hospital where doctors worked to keep her alive. Realising she was losing her baby, medics said she cried out to them:, “Kill me now!”. Surgeon Timur Marin said the woman's pelvis had been crushed and her hip detached. Medics delivered the baby via cesarean section, but it showed “no signs of life,” the surgeon said. After a further 30 minutes of resuscitation attempts Marin said medics had to give up. “Both died,"" he said. On Saturday, Ukraine's foreign ministry said that Russian military had shelled a mosque in Mariupol where over 80 adults and children were sheltering. Russian president Vladimir Putin initially said that his invasion of Ukraine would not target any civilians, but the offensive has since bombed multiple towns and cities, resulting in a massive refugee crisis. Foreign officials have said that Russia is targeting civilians to try and ""break morale."" On Monday, a Ukrainian woman living in Kent said “all we can do is hope” after not hearing from her family in Mariupol for 12 days. Last week, Yuliya Campbell, 36, from Kent said it was “torture” not knowing if her family were OK. Mrs Campbell, who was born and grew up in the southern Ukrainian city, said her family members are thought to be among tens of thousands of civilians trapped in the city.",World/Yahoo News UK,Street cleaners collect dead bodies in Ukraine after thousands killed by Russian troops,https://news.yahoo.com/street-cleaners-collect-dead-bodies-ukraine-thousands-killed-150437702.html
