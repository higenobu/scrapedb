1/16/2022,"John Sainsbury, Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover, who has died aged 94, was the driving force behind the family supermarket chain for 23 years as its determined chairman. Perhaps more than anyone else he secured its position as one of the country’s leading food shops. “Mr JD”, as he was known within the company, was said to be a retailer to his fingertips, personally tasting each of the company’s product lines before it went on sale and approving all packaging designs. He was known to descend unannounced on stores for terrifying inspections and interrogations of local managers. He could be a temperamental boss.  When he became chairman in 1969 – the fourth generation in the family firm since its foundation in the mid-19th century – its profit of £4.3m was half that of Tesco and a ninth of Marks and Spencer. When he retired on his 65th birthday in 1992, the company had overtaken its rivals to become the largest supermarket in Britain, had branched out into the Homebase do-it-yourself chain, launched in the US by taking over a supermarket group there, and was recording an annual profit of £628m. He retained the presidency of the company and led successful family opposition to a takeover bid by private equity companies in 2007. It was very much a family firm: he succeeded his uncle, Sir Robert Sainsbury, as head of the business, and on retirement passed the chairmanship on to Sir Robert’s son David Sainsbury: a not entirely happy arrangement, as his cousin, 13 years his junior, did not seem as committed to the grocery business as he was. John Sainsbury felt the business stagnated under his successor, whose chief interest was in science and who left the chairmanship in 1998 to become a minister in Tony Blair’s government. The older man was a staunch Tory, as was his younger brother, Tim, an MP and former business minister. John was the eldest son of Alan Sainsbury, who would also be chairman of the company in the 1960s and become a Labour life peer, and his first wife, Doreen Davan Adams. The couple divorced when their son was 12 and John was sent to Stowe school and subsequently studied history at Worcester College, Oxford, for which the family became major benefactors, supplying a residential block for students. After national service with the army in Palestine, he joined the family firm in 1950, becoming a buyer the following year and being put in charge of bacon purchases in 1956. He became a director two years later and vice-chairman following his father’s retirement in 1967. It was a period of rapid change in the grocery business. Alan Sainsbury had introduced the company’s first self-service store in Croydon in 1950 after seeing supermarkets in the US – an angry customer, affronted at having to serve herself, threw a wire basket at him on opening day – and had also started frozen food and own-brand lines. During John Sainsbury’s chairmanship all the remaining 82 counter-service branches were closed and 313 large supermarkets replaced the previous 244 stores. Branches more than quadrupled in size, from an average 8,000 sq ft to nearly 35,000 sq ft, and the range of products increased from 4,000 to 16,000, half of them own-brand. In 1973 the company was floated on the stock market in what was described as the biggest flotation to that time, the family owning 85% of the stock, though that decreased substantially over time as shares were redirected to the family’s web of charitable trusts and foundations. Between the flotation in 1973 and John Sainsbury’s retirement in 1992 the company’s market capitalisation rose from £117m to over £8bn. Sainsbury married the former ballet dancer Anya Linden in 1963 and the couple established the Linbury charitable trust – a combination of their two names – to channel donations eventually totalling more than £150m to projects largely devoted to art and the performing arts, heritage and educational projects. Among them, in collaboration with other family members, was the £50m Sainsbury wing to the National Gallery, memorably if unhelpfully and inaccurately described by the Prince of Wales as a “monstrous carbuncle”; it was rather better than the war-damage car park it replaced. There was also the Linbury studio theatre attached to the Royal Opera House, the Linbury biennial prize for stage design and a £25m donation to the British Museum. Other less high-profile donations were made for medical research including, partly for family reasons, research into chronic fatigue syndrome, and to the St John of Jerusalem eye hospital on the Palestinian West Bank, an interest dating back to Sainsbury’s national service days. He served on a wide range of boards and as a trustee for institutions including the Royal Ballet School, the Royal Opera House, Dulwich Picture Gallery, the National and Tate galleries, the Ashmolean Museum, the Rhodes Trust and the Nelson Mandela children’s fund. He was an honorary fellow of his old college for many years. He was knighted in 1980, and given a life peerage in 1989. He is survived by Anya, their two sons, John Julian and Mark, and a daughter, Sarah.

1/16/2022,"Ministers are seeing “encouraging” signs that plan B coronavirus restrictions in England could be lifted in 10 days’ time, the chair of the Conservative party, Oliver Dowden, has said. Current measures in England, including guidance to work from home and the widespread use of face coverings, were imposed in early December to help tackle the spread of Omicron. They are set to be reviewed on 26 January.  In the clearest hint yet that some or all of the measures will be removed on that date, Dowden, who also serves as minister without portfolio, said that while the government would review further data this week before making a decision, the “signs are encouraging”. His comments came after health and scientific experts expressed cautious optimism this weekend that the Covid situation was improving. Dr Susan Hopkins, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) chief medical adviser, said cases appeared to be “plateauing” in parts of the UK, and added that while cases were still relatively high, there had also been a slowdown in hospital admissions. Prof Linda Bauld, a professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh and chief social policy adviser to the Scottish government, said Omicron cases in the UK appeared to be “stabilising”. Dr Chris Smith, a consultant virologist and lecturer at Cambridge University, said the latest data gave him “great cause for optimism”. Dowden told Sky News’ Trevor Phillips on Sunday programme: “It has always been my hope that we would have the plan B restrictions for the shortest period possible. “I’m under no doubt the kind of burdens this puts hospitality, wider business, schools and so on under, and I want us to get rid of those if we possibly can. The signs are encouraging but, clearly, we will wait to see the data ahead of that final decision.” Sir Keir Starmer said he hoped plan B restrictions could be lifted “as soon as possible”. Speaking on the BBC’s Sunday Morning programme, the Labour leader said: “I think the sooner we can lift the final restrictions, the better. I think that’s what the whole country want. “It’s important that we’re led by the science on this. We had access to the government scientific and medical advisers, and that’s helped us form our views. “I hope those restrictions can be lifted as soon as possible, but I want them to be lifted because the medical science says they should be lifted, not simply because the prime minister is in a real mess and he’s desperately trying to get out of it. “So, if it’s the right thing to lift those restrictions, we will vote to lift those restrictions. But we’ll be led by the science as we always have been, not by the politics of propping up a broken prime minister.” The shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, said he could not be confident the government was not looking to lift plan B measures in a bid to shore up Boris Johnson’s leadership. He told Trevor Phillips on Sunday: “If the prime minister or the health secretary from the Conservative party is coming forward saying, ‘We’re going to remove Plan B measures’, I want to be absolutely confident they are making that decision in the national interest and not in the party interest, for party management reasons. I don’t have total confidence about that.”",News/World news,‘Encouraging signs’ plan B Covid measures may soon be lifted in England,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/16/encouraging-signs-plan-b-covid-measures-may-soon-be-lifted-in-england
1/16/2022,"Come at the king, you’d best not miss. But Romelu Lukaku did, twice. First before half-time when, on the charge and with the ball on his stronger left foot, he opted, bafflingly, to try to lay in Hakim Ziyech, who was offside even if the pass had been accurate; and then in the second half when, laid through by Mateo Kovacic, he opened his body to try to curl an effort round Ederson, only to find that the keeper had read his barely disguised intentions and was diving to make a save that was far more comfortable than it ought to have been.  And that’s the problem when you’ve recently given a television interview questioning the formation, especially when the team you’ve joined are European champions: it places scrutiny on your own performance that isn’t tremendously helpful. Little wonder that Thomas Tuchel was unwilling to spare his £97.5m striker afterwards. Was Lukaku the only reason Chelsea lost to Manchester City on Saturday? Clearly not but, for all City appeared dominant, that game was not that far from following the pattern of last season’s Champions League final or FA Cup semi-final between the sides: City with lots of the ball but unable to break down a well-organised Chelsea and undone on the counterattack. Had Kepa not given that little skip to his right before Kevin De Bruyne’s shot, had Lukaku made more of either of his two big opportunities, this might easily have been regarded as another Tuchel masterclass. To an extent, that only highlights how result-driven a lot of analysis is: as Juanma Lillo, City’s assistant coach, once observed, what is praised is not what is done well but what ends well. But this was not like the game between the sides at Stamford Bridge earlier in the season; City were not so superior on Saturday as they had been then. They are a supremely talented side and there are limits to what an opposing manager can do against them, even with a squad like Chelsea’s. On Saturday, Chelsea did largely contain City and they did cause occasional problems on the break; for all the understandable frustration that Chelsea weren’t more proactive given their need to win in order to remain with even a sniff of the title, there was not a huge amount more they could have done. Perhaps they could have gone a little more direct a little more often, perhaps they could have slung in a few more crosses for Lukaku to contest with John Stones and Aymeric Laporte, but retaining possession and with it the control that has characterised Tuchel’s Chelsea at their best was key to the plan. Little wonder, then, that Tuchel was frustrated with Lukaku, something apparent in his gesticulations on the touchline as well as his words after the match. “He had many ball losses without pressure and in very promising circumstances,” the manager said. “Of course we want to serve him but he is part of the team and sometimes he needs to do service as well. He had a huge chance so he’s included in this. “He is part of the team and the performances up front, especially in the first half, we can do much better and we need to do better. We had eight or nine attacking transitions in the first half and zero touches in the box. That is a big problem. There was a lack of timing and composure. We could have had more chances if we played with better precision.” Lukaku’s form is of more general concern. He’s not the only Chelsea forward underperforming. It’s only fair to acknowledge the impact of injuries and illness but none of Kai Havertz, Christian Pulisic, Timo Werner or Hakim Ziyech, brought in at a combined cost of £210m, have entirely convinced either. But his case is the most baffling. Lukaku had shown glimpses of talent in the Premier League before; the sense was that he was as much a victim of Manchester United’s malaise as a cause. He had shown with Belgium his tactical intelligence, his capacity for drifting wide to create space for advanced midfielders – which seemed to be just what Chelsea needed in a front man – allied to an immense physical presence. And then there were his goals: 47 of them in the league over twoseasons in an Inter team based around pressing, albeit a more frenetic system than that favoured by Tuchel. But maybe a championship in which 40-year-old Zlatan Ibrahimovic and 35-year-old Edin Dzeko still stand out isn’t that much of a gauge. It’s early. Nobody should be written off six months into a move. Lukaku has scored five goals in nine Premier League starts. But the truth is that this feels a lot like his time at United. There are flickers of what he could be. The way he turned Stones before his ill-conceived pass to Ziyech was a demonstration of how terrifying he can be for defenders. But five of his 12 attempted passes failed to find a teammate. His one attempted dribble squandered possession. On the 42 occasions teammates attempted to find him with a pass, only 12 times did he claim possession. He lost all eight of his aerial duels (which may explain Chelsea’s reluctance to cross). He registered only one touch in the City box. Playing against City is difficult, but that was not the performance of a player who can be demanding formational changes to suit him. Lukaku is 28 now. His gifts are obvious and seem abundant, and perhaps that generates unreasonable expectation. But if it ever is going to really work for him in the Premier League, it is going to have to be soon.",Sport/Football,Romelu Lukaku’s complaints ring hollow as finishing touch deserts him | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/16/romelu-lukaku-chelsea-manchester-city

It takes the form of an extended letter written to the chair of the board of Yad Vashem, Israel’s national Holocaust museum, by a nameless historian who’s found himself trapped in a career as a tour guide of Holocaust sites in Poland – immersive, horror-filled work that’s quite naturally driven him to a nervous breakdown. Where the book excels is in its readiness to court controversy without surrendering nuance, and in place of moralising it offers questioning that’s as necessary as it is unsettling.

Veteran American literary scholar Arnold Weinstein presents an irresistible thesis in this agile, instantly engaging work of personal literary criticism. He anchors it in his early experiences as an identical twin, and, through works by authors from Sophocles to Toni Morrison, shows us how the shapeshifting that they enable alters and expands our own sense of self.

1/16/2022,"Who was Bice Lazzari? At the Estorick Collection in north London, the curator Renato Miracco puts the case for this too little-known Italian modernist with utmost straightforwardness. On display are 40 works, offered with next to nothing by way of commentary; should you want to know something of Lazzari’s family background, for instance, you’ll just have to do your own research. But if such an approach seems, at times, on the risky side – in the gallery, it’s hard to get your bearings at first – Miracco’s confidence that Lazzari’s art will ultimately speak for itself is surely not misplaced. What an exhibition! Down the years, I find that I’ve grown pretty weary of a certain kind of abstraction; whatever it might have meant at first, it seems ever more etiolated to me. Yet here is Lazzari, making the case for it all over again. Out of discord, whether internal or external, she creates a harmony so exquisite, her work seems at moments almost to vibrate. However fiercely suggestive it is of the “obscure forces” that drove her as an artist – primal instincts that would not let up even towards the end of her life, when she lost her sight – it’s also deeply and enduringly tranquil. Under their spell, I came to think of her paintings as answers to questions I did not know had even been asked.  In photographs, Lazzari (1900-81) has something of the elfin look of Giulietta Masina, the star of Fellini’s 1954 masterpiece La Strada – or so I thought, struggling to put her in context. Very few artists captured the uncommon seclusion and poverty of postwar Italy as well as Fellini did, and this was the world that forged Lazzari, too. Only after the war did she find her way to abstraction, arriving there without the help of teachers or even of artist role models (Mussolini’s fascists had frowned on abstraction as a decadent foreign disease). “I knew nothing about painting abroad because of the provincial climate of cultural isolation that held sway at the time,” she later admitted. In the galleries at the Estorick, her work calls to mind – it’s almost too obvious – that of her near contemporaries Agnes Martin and (less often) Richard Diebenkorn, both of whom were associated with American abstract expressionism. But her minimalism and her sense of colour really were, it seems, the result of solitary exploration. She travelled alone, at first. Lazzari was born in Venice, where her parents were wholesalers; she studied to be an artist there and in Florence, the city to which her family moved between late 1917 and early 1918. As a woman, she was encouraged, on graduation, not to paint, but to work in design. But this seems not to have disheartened her. Quite the opposite, in fact. As she put it: “When my father died in 1928, I had to face life on a practical level and so, rather than walking around with a painting under my arm, I took a loom and started making applied art in order to continue living in the climate I so adored – namely, freedom.” On display at the Estorick are a striped, handwoven bag and belt from 1929 that still look so good – so boldly modern – they might as well be on sale in 21st-century Liberty or Selfridges. In the 1930s, Lazzari moved to Rome, supporting herself by collaborating with designers, and there she would remain for the rest of her life, save for a brief period during the war when she and her husband, Diego Rosa, worked with the architect Gio Ponti in Milan. But though her various projects were often exhibited – at the Estorick, one of her hand-sewn cushions has been placed in a frame, where it looks almost as beguiling as her work on canvas – it wasn’t until after 1945 that she was able to devote herself to painting. Before 1964, she worked mostly in oil; after that, having developed an allergic reaction to it, she switched to acrylic, “a thankless but strong, sturdy, resilient material” that eventually became her firm “friend”. It helped her, perhaps, to more clearly express her vision. As Miracco suggests in a catalogue essay, Lazzari’s late “apparitions” of colour, however ghostly, also have the quality of lightning: a suggestion of infinity. Her Agnes Martin-like austerity is matched with a bravura that is all her own. Some paintings are for the mind. But Lazzari’s are for the body: you absorb their mood as you would that of a person to whom you’re attracted, excitement gradually shading into a feeling of absolute rightness. The early work is energetically geometric: in Abstraction of a Line No 2 (1925), coloured rules scatter like pick-up-sticks; the repeated pattern of Continuous Rhythm (tempera on card, 1939) might work as wallpaper. But then things open up. White and Black (oil on canvas, 1954) is wilfully misnamed; its orange-red background is the thing, calling you like the sun. You know even before you read its title that Marine Tale (oil on canvas, 1956) is inspired by boats in a harbour, rectangles of every shade of blue and grey conjuring bobbing sails. What strange and elusive formula is it that makes Untitled (tempera and pencil on canvas, 1966) and Acrylic No 5 (acrylic on canvas, 1975) so alluring? Why did I find it so unexpectedly hard to turn my back on these barely-there lines and circles? This cannot, I’m afraid, be easily explained in words. All I can tell you is that leaving this exhibition induced in me a disproportionate feeling that was close to grief – and that you would be completely mad to miss it.

On eerie opener Gasoline, Tesfaye asks a lover to literally set him on fire, while songs such as Sacrifice and the shimmering Less Than Zero wrestle with past misdeeds and the sense that emotional destruction is all he knows.

1/16/2022,"For proof of how dangerous Boris Johnson’s leadership has become, consider this: public health policy is now merely a subplot in the horrendous drama engulfing the Conservative party. Over the weekend, as government advisers urged caution over Covid restrictions, the prime minister’s allies suggested that the imminent lifting of England’s remaining curbs would launch his fightback. But an unnamed minister cited in the Spectator thought that binning the last rules could neatly coincide with the prime minister’s resignation. This, it was said, would give him an opportunity to claim a huge job had been done and “depart with dignity”. But as with most of what we are hearing from senior Tories, the suggestion seemed to have another meaning: his exit is imagined not just as the end of Johnson’s time at the top, but the curtain falling on a period of interventionist, big-spending government, so normal Tory service can be resumed. Clearly, the prime minister’s disgrace is entirely down to events in Downing Street, the dreadful symbolism of so many elements of the story, and an administration mired in arrogance, deceit and an awful absence of seriousness – a condition now to be cured by a staff-blaming effort which has been named “Operation Save Big Dog”. But in the surrounding mood music, there are also ideological elements. Over the past two years, as the Treasury funded people’s wages, austerity diminished as a political priority, and the state’s reach increased to an extent unseen outside wartime, there has been a lot of speculation about how those changes would permanently alter politics.  For the Tories, such a shift would have gone with the grain of a lot of what Johnson embraced, albeit in his usual half-arsed way: his embryonic “levelling up” drive, a readiness to put up taxes, the flexing of the state’s muscles in pursuit of net zero carbon emissions. But nearly two years on from the start of the pandemic, with the prime minister seemingly broken and potential successors on less than subtle manoeuvres, Conservatism does not feel like that at all. Rather than pushing their politics somewhere new, the Covid crisis seems to have sent terrified Tories back to their old beliefs – in small government, untrammelled business and the idea that even well-intentioned spending always leads to disaster. Back in December, when the government faced a huge parliamentary rebellion over new restrictions, Westminster journalists were picking up anxiety among Conservative MPs about a “Covid state”, and the risk of Johnson creating a “high-tax, high-spending, high-inflation country”. Steve Baker, the de facto leader of the Brexit backbench hardcore, thinks that “today’s Conservative party is in the wrong place and heading in the opposite direction of Conservatism”. Meanwhile, rightwing columnists rage at a government supposedly waging war “on cars, foreign travel and all other parts of the suburban dream”. As ever, a reliable indicator of Tory restlessness is how often people mention Margaret Thatcher. Baker has just relaunched the self-consciously Thatcherite pressure group Conservative Way Forward. Meanwhile, the frontrunners for Johnson’s job are routinely seen as inheritors of her mantle. According to the Economist, Rishi Sunak “has the same ingrained enthusiasm for balancing budgets and limiting expenditure as the grocer’s daughter had”. Liz Truss seems ecstatically happy to give the impression of someone starring in a school play about the blessed Margaret, and makes speeches about the dangers of “inexorably growing the size of the state”, as opposed to the wonders of “free trade and free enterprise”. Much the same instincts define potential candidates such as Kwasi Kwarteng, Nadhim Zahawi and Priti Patel. If Johnson’s more interventionist Toryism has any base of support, it probably lies among the new MPs elected in the so-called red wall seats, but they are too marginal and inexperienced to field a candidate, or exert much influence. So, when his fall comes, it looks set to herald a moment of ideological restoration. Johnson’s reckless authoritarianism – the one aspect of his record that does echo Thatcher – will presumably be retained; what will be thrown overboard will be the last meaningful traces of levelling up, and any pretence that Conservatism is interested in changing the economy for the good of society. Is this what 2022 really demands? Thatcherism may still define the Tory soul, the country it was designed to change has long gone thanks to Conservative victories in the 1980s. The revolution was not left half-finished but completed: there are no powerful unions to tame, no utilities to privatise, no big bang to detonate in the City, and not much else to deregulate. Some Conservatives would like to finally subject the NHS to the disciplines of profit and loss, but to do so would risk political calamity. The resumed cutting of public spending might gladden Thatcherite hearts, but more sensible Tories long ago realised that austerity had already gone way too far. The reason that there have been sporadic Tory attempts to move away from the politics of the free market – the fitful stirrings of “red Toryism”, the tilts in that direction under both Johnson and Theresa May – is because that approach has long since run out of road. Certainly, if whoever succeeds Johnson wants to sustain the electoral coalition that delivered victory two years ago, the need for different thinking should be obvious. Yet the self-styled inheritors of Thatcherism have always wanted to keep the revolution going, and their furious zeal has long since turned Conservative politics unhinged and strange. In the absence of a big, disruptive Thatcher-esque project, Brexit – along with the insane idea of turning the UK economy into “Singapore-on-Thames” – moved from the political fringes to the Tory mainstream and unsettled the party’s relationship with many of its old suburban heartlands, which are not just full of remainers but increasingly liberal and left-leaning. In the beliefs of Truss, Kwarteng, Patel and more, you see Thatcherism taken to its logical conclusion, as a cold credo that wants to completely subjugate life to the demands of the market. (Remember that notorious sentence in their book Britannia Unchained: “﻿Once they enter the workplace, the British are among the worst idlers in the world.”) In the hands of Baker and co, Thatcher’s legacy has ceased to be about ideas and policy, but has been reduced instead to a puritanical animus that leads people to endlessly scent betrayal and plot against the people at the top. The Tories may soon be on to their seventh leader in 20 years. This, perhaps, is what happens when a party simply doesn’t know what to do with itself. Among people on the left, there is a righteous relish about the prospect of Johnson’s departure, and with very good reason. But this should be seen as an uneasy moment, replete with both hope and danger. Even if he goes, it could be nearly three years until another general election. Any Conservative voices who might warn against their party’s resurgent right are so far conspicuously quiet. If the next occupant of Downing Street attempts the full-blown return of Tory ideas that have already torn Britain apart, could the weary public mood after Brexit and Covid allow them to succeed? Or will something so clearly out of step with its time soon fail? Whenever post-Johnson politics arrives, these will be its defining questions.

Graham Reagan said his son had to drive him to hospital after being told the nearest ambulance was 30 to 40 miles away.  Reagan, from Malton in North Yorkshire, said he called 999 when his chest pains became unbearable and that he was collapsing when he arrived at York hospital in the early hours of 18 December. “What does an NHS crisis look like? If it’s 2 o’clock in the morning, you’re having a heart attack, and you can’t get an ambulance, is that a crisis? It’s not working. It certainly didn’t work for me,” he said. The army was last week drafted in to drive ambulances in parts of England, including Yorkshire and in the home counties, as the service comes under huge pressure amid staff absences of up to 20% due to Covid. Reagan said he was with his wife and son when they were advised to drive him to hospital as he suffered a suspected heart attack. “My wife doesn’t drive, but fortunately my son was with us and he drove me to York hospital. I’m in the back of the car – the pain is getting worse and I’m now getting quite upset,” he said. He said staff at the hospital were “absolutely brilliant” and arranged for him to be transferred to Hull for treatment after a heart attack was confirmed. However, he said he faced a further 35-minute wait for an ambulance to take him. Reagan said he wanted to share his experience to raise awareness: “I assume there will be deaths [due to ambulance delays]. Is that OK? “Today might be the day when there aren’t enough ambulances and you might be the person who is waiting for one. Today might not be your lucky day and you might not get the excellent care that you will get if you’re in hospital.” A spokesman for Yorkshire ambulance service NHS trust said they were sorry to hear of Reagan’s concerns. They said, in common with other ambulance services, they had been under “significant operational pressures for some time” and, while staff did their best to respond quickly, they acknowledged “some patients are having to wait longer for an ambulance response”.",News/Society,Heart attack patient raises alarm after NHS advised him to make own way to hospital,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/16/heart-attack-patient-raises-alarm-nhs-hospital-yorkshire-ambulance-service
