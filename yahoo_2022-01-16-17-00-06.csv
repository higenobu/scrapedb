1/16/2022,"MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Novak Djokovic’s hopes of playing at the Australian Open were dashed Sunday after a court dismissed the top-ranked tennis star’s appeal against a deportation order. Three Federal Court judges unanimously upheld a decision made on Friday by Immigration Minister Alex Hawke to cancel the 34-year-old Serb’s visa on public interest grounds. The decision likely means that Djokovic, who is not vaccinated against COVID-19, will remain in detention in Melbourne until he is deported. Deportation usually occurs as soon as possible after an order unless prevented by court action. The government has not said when Djokovic will leave. A deportation order also usually includes a three-year ban on returning to Australia. Chief Justice James Allsop said the ruling came down to whether the minister's decision was ""irrational or legally unreasonable.” “It is no part of the function of the court to decide upon the merits or wisdom of the decision,” Allsop said. The panel of judges did not provide written explanations for their decision on Sunday. Those would be released in the coming days, Allsop said. “This is not an appeal against the decision of the executive government,” Allsop said. “It is an application to the court as a separate arm of the government ... to review ... the lawfulness or the legality of the (minister's) decision.” Djokovic was also ordered to pay the government's court costs. The court process that Djokovic had hoped would to keep his aspirations alive for a 21st Grand Slam title was extraordinarily fast by Australian standards. Within three hours of Hawke's announcement on Friday afternoon that Djokovic's visa was cancelled, his lawyers were before a Federal Circuit and Family Court judge to initiate their challenge to the decision. The case was elevated to the Federal Court on Saturday and submissions were filed by both sides that same day. The three judges heard the case over five hours on Sunday and announced their verdict two hours later. Between the end of the hearing and the verdict, Tennis Australia, the tournament's organizer, had announced that Djokovic was scheduled to play the last match on Monday at the Rod Laver Arena. He was due to play Miomir Kecmanovic, a fellow Serb ranked 78th in the world. Tennis Australia had no immediate comment on the star player's legal defeat. The minister cancelled the visa on the grounds that Djokovic’s presence in Australia may be a risk to the health and “good order” of the Australian public and “may be counterproductive to efforts at vaccination by others in Australia.” Djokovic’s visa was initially cancelled on Jan. 6 at Melbourne’s airport hours after he arrived to compete in the first Grand Slam of 2022. A border official cancelled his visa after deciding Djokovic didn’t qualify for a medical exemption from Australia’s rules for unvaccinated visitors.",World/Associated Press,Tennis star Djokovic loses deportation appeal in Australia,https://news.yahoo.com/djokovic-loses-deportation-appeal-australia-065847054.html
1/16/2022,"Australian authorities rejected the visa Novak Djokovic for the second time on Friday over his submission of what they deemed to be a dishonest vaccine medical exemption, moving to deport the Serbian tennis champion despite an Australian court’s ruling in his favor last week. Immigration Minister Alex Hawke acted unilaterally to deny the player’s visa again this month, claiming it would be improper to admit Djokovic given that he may have reported false information on an immigration form about his purported natural immunity from a recent Covid infection. “In making this decision, I carefully considered information provided to me by the Department of Home Affairs, the Australian Border Force and Mr. Djokovic,” Hawke said in a statement. Hawke’s decision likely means Djokovic will be barred from defending his record of victories at the upcoming Australian Open tournament, which he has won nine times and where he seeks a 21st Grand Slam title. The athlete had claimed he tested positive for the virus in December but did not experience symptoms, according to court documents. While a temporary pass of entry can be provided to applicants who contracted Covid within six months, Australian Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews noted that the exemption only applies to “acute major medical illness,” which Djokovic did not exhibit. He argued that the faulty travel declaration was “human error” on the part of an agent and mere miscommunication, and that he did not intentionally do anything unethical. The tennis star’s visa was first denied by the Australian Border Force last week, who determined that he had an inadmissible vaccine medical exemption for foreign travelers. Djokovic was detained at a housing facility for refugees and asylum seekers while his case was being adjudicated. Djokovic’s parents were outraged by the incident, with his father promising protest and civil unrest last week if the Australian government didn’t release his son, who he claimed was being held “captive.” Given that several vaccinated players have tested positive ahead of the competition, proving that the Omicron variant does not discriminate based on inoculation status, Djokovic’s mother questioned the scientific basis and fairness behind his son’s disqualification. “If he’s healthy, if his PCR is negative, why he cannot play?” she asked Australia’s Channel 7 News on Wednesday.
