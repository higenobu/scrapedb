2/12/2022,"Early counting in four New South Wales byelections on Saturday did not bode well for the Perrottet government, with the potential loss of the seat of Bega and a double-digit swing recorded in the blue-ribbon seat of Willoughby. The four Super Saturday byelections were seen as the first test to Dominic Perrottet’s leadership since he became premier following the resignation of Gladys Berejiklian in September.  Official victors were unlikely to be declared in the seats for some time, with an unusually high proportion of postal votes cast, which will not start to be counted until 19 February. However, based on the 18% of votes counted by 8.30pm on Saturday night, the ABC election analyst, Antony Green, predicted Labor’s Michael Holland would win Bega, after attracting 56% of the two-party preferred vote so far. The seat was previously held by the former transport minister Andrew Constance, who resigned to contest the next federal election. “There is nothing to indicate anything other than a big enough swing for Labor to win Bega,” Green said. Speaking after the polls closed, Holland said it would be a “tough win”. “What is clear is that our new premier needs to listen – our region deserves better,” he said. Labor also seemed likely to retain the seat of Strathfield, where the former UN lawyer Jason Yat-sen Li had been campaigning against the Liberal candidate and businesswoman Bridget Sakr. Sakr – whose 11-year-old daughter died with three others when they were struck by a drunk driver in 2020 – was considered a strong candidate who some believed could seize the seat following the departure of the former Labor leader Jodi McKay. While the Liberals expect Tim James to retain Berejiklian’s former seat of Willoughby, early results showed a large swing to the independent candidate Larissa Penn. Nichole Overall looked likely to become the first woman to represent the people of Monaro, with the Nationals on track to hold the seat of the former deputy premier and party leader John Barilaro. Polling stations were unusually quiet on Saturday after the NSW Electoral Commission sent all registered voters a postal vote pack. Usually they need to be requested. With the deadline for postal votes extended until 25 February, and postal votes not being counted until 19 February, official results will not be known for some time. Campaigning in Willoughby earlier on Saturday, Perrottet said the byelections were a chance for votes to say what direction they wanted to see the state move in. “I see it as a vote in terms of making sure a clear decision between do you want to go backwards as a state or do you want to go forwards?” he said. “That’s what the Liberals and Nationals here in NSW want to do – we want to take our state forward. We need to open up and we don’t want to go back into lockdown.” Constance on Saturday night said there had been a “very big swing” in Bega, which he held with a 6.9% margin, congratulating both candidates. “John is an incredibly hardworking person and everyone who knows Fiona [Kotvojs] knows her dedication to our community,” he said. He said there had been major challenges for the community over the past two years – from bushfires to Covid – and all of that would be playing a part in the results. Liberal party members told the Guardian they were not surprised by the result, saying it was always the most concerning seat for the government. Kotvojs campaigned heavily on local issues, attempting to distance on herself from Macquarie Street.",News/Australia news,NSW byelections: early results suggest Perrottet government may lose seat of Bega,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/12/nsw-byelections-early-results-suggest-perrottet-government-may-lose-seat-of-bega
2/12/2022,"With a newborn in a sling and a polystyrene tray of fish and chips in his hands, Fred MacGregor came across this scene at the end of North Yorkshire’s Saltburn Pier. The photographer was on holiday with his wife and children, so had “neither the space in the bag, nor the headspace” for his usual DSLR. “The photographer Chase Jarvis once said, ‘The best camera is the one you have with you’ and it was an iPhone 7 I had with me that day,” MacGregor says. “Sometimes shooting on a phone can have its limitations, but on this occasion it performed just fine. I only needed a few minor edits, like a bit of brightening, to really bring out the central line of the wave.”  Originally from London, MacGregor has long admired the quality of light in the north of England, finding it more “clear, low and brilliant” than in the capital. The way it hit the cliffs and the water appealed to his photographic eye, as did the relatively unusual angle of the shot. “A lot of surf photographs are taken from the beach, facing out to sea, or along the barrel of the wave. With this, I was able to show the context, and position this kinetic figure in its wider environment,” MacGregor says. “The twee, colourful beach huts stand in contrast to the bleak industrial landscape to the right, but both are part of the truth,” he says. “A picture that tells the truth can be tricky to find these days.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘The twee beach huts stand in contrast to the bleak industrial landscape’: Fred MacGregor’s best phone picture,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/12/fred-macgregors-best-phone-picture
2/12/2022,"We British, who like to think we’re a nation of animal lovers, have been given an opportunity to bask in the warm glow of this reassuring self-image now that more than 150,000 people have signed a petition calling for the West Ham footballer Kurt Zouma to be prosecuted after a video emerged of him kicking his cat. Within two days of his being shamed, the RSPCA had seized Zouma’s cats and his club had fined him £250,000. One-nil to the good old animal-loving Anglo-Saxons. However, we also ought be somewhat shamefaced that a different petition, calling for a footballer who lost a civil rape case to be released by his club, garnered fewer than 6,000 signatures. It took three days for Raith Rovers to do a U-turn on David Goodwillie’s signing.  In the minds of many, however, all this shows is that we sometimes love our animals just a bit too much, which is not much of a confession. If we really were worried that we cared more for cats than rape victims, there would have been more outrage at the airlifting of 173 cats and dogs from Kabul at the potential expense of people. Instead, we mostly shrugged our shoulders, agreed it might have been a bit excessive, but still felt pleased that the beasts had escaped the Taliban’s extreme version of sharia law. However, our hypocrisy is much worse than this, for believing that our only flaw is that we love animals too much conveniently disguises the fact that, more often than not, human interests completely trump those of other animals. The truth is that the attitude we show towards most animals is not always real love; often it is an unhealthy anthropocentric sentimentality. Yes, we have tender feelings towards fluffy companion animals, gambolling lambs and alpacas under threat of involuntary euthanasia. But these feelings are only directed towards animals when and if they are pleasing to us. Whenever protecting or enhancing an animal’s welfare brings costs to ourselves, our so-called love mysteriously vanishes. The perfect symbol of this is pet food. We make sure our darling pets get their nutritionally complete meals and smile warmly when we see them tucking in. But that food is made mostly of other animals, and very little of it comes from high-welfare meat. So we keep one set of animals in industrial farms where many never see the light of day while we treat others as though we are honoured to be guests in their homes. No true animal lover would be indifferent to the wellbeing of one used to feed another. Yet most people not only do it, they don’t give it a second’s thought. They are as mesmerised by heartwarming animal stories as they are blind to disturbing ones. Hence they can get indignant about the court order to put down one alpaca called Geronimo but do not blink an eye over the estimated 60,000 nameless dairy bull calves slaughtered at birth so we can have our daily milk. What’s more, the way we treat our pets suggests that it isn’t true love anyway. Take so-called dog lovers. Centuries of breeding have meant that many of the most popular breeds have lifelong health issues. The flat snouts of pugs and bulldogs, for instance, often cause them respiratory and eye problems. Dachshunds suffer spinal problems, and are prone to obesity. Pretty much any hound other than a mongrel or a rescue dog is the product of an industry perpetuating animal suffering. These facts are well-enough known, but people conveniently forget them. They see facial and bodily distortions as cute rather than as harmful deformities. But real love requires an appreciation of the object of that love as it really is. Otherwise your affection is for a fantasy, an image of the beloved that bears no relation to the reality. We may not care about or notice the contradictions contained in our relationship to animals, but politicians have. They know that moral consistency doesn’t matter as long as they push the right emotional buttons. For instance, the most popular policy in Jeremy Corbyn’s 2017 Labour manifesto was the pledge to keep the foxhunting ban in place. Labour campaigners pushed this hard, especially among younger voters on social media. The Conservatives, meanwhile, tried to burnish their own animal-friendly status by talking up their plans to ban the ivory trade, even though this wasn’t in their manifesto. Neither party said much about the meat or pet industries, which have a far greater impact on animal welfare. The strategy of trying to create an animal-friendly image – call it “fur-washing” – is alive and well today. For instance, the government has been drip-feeding news of its plans to ban foie gras. But many of the duck and geese reared for foie gras have better lives than the broiler poultry cooped up in intensive units in the UK. And all the while the government is boasting about ending paltry sales of a niche product, it is also seeking to negotiate trade deals with countries such as Australia and the US that will open our borders to lower-welfare meat and dairy. Our wildly inconsistent attitudes to animals persist in part because formulating consistent ones is difficult. Even going down the vegan route and opposing all use of animals for human ends doesn’t guarantee proportionate responses. Most vegans are probably more revolted by foie gras than they are by Turkey Twizzlers. The price of our anthropocentric sentimentalism is high. It means that we too often put animal welfare over that of humans. Animal welfare is the most popular cause for charitable donors in the UK, above children and medical research. At the same time, that concern is often misdirected so the animals that suffer most are not just ignored, they are eaten with pleasure. To top it all, politicians know how to tug on these warped heartstrings, and so our irrationality becomes a means for our own manipulation. A more mature and nuanced attitude to animals is sorely needed. But when an immature and simplistic one is so deeply embedded in the national psyche, I can’t see how we’re going to get it.

2/12/2022,"The citric kick of the limes which grow abundantly across Mexico – the world’s largest producer of the fruit – help give the country’s cuisine its distinctive flavour. But aggressive price-fixing by criminal groups has sent prices soaring, prompting some eateries to stop offering limes with their tacos – and leaving diners in a sour twist.  “If you go to the taquería they tell you there is no lime, or there is one small lime for 10 people,” said Romain Le Cour, security and violence reduction program officer at the thinktank México Evalúa. “It’s almost a joke.” Prices often peak in winter but this year they have reached unprecedented highs, due to falling production, continued exports and colder weather. The average cost of limes has tripled since January 2021 – from 17 pesos (almost a dollar) to 56 pesos per kilo, according to state data. And amid an escalating cost-of-living crisis due to inflation, cartels are imposing increasing controls over producers during the bumper crop season – in part to fund an escalating war in the western state of Michoacán where the aggressive expansion of the Jalisco New Generation cartel (JNGC) has unleashed a bitter conflict with a coalition of local groups known as the United Cartels. “The lime trade is a billion-dollar industry and, for any criminal group, it’s very easy and extremely profitable for them to go to the farmers and tell them what they need to pay for protection,” said Le Cour. “It’s classic mafia.” The harvest in Michoacán in December was down 26% from the month before and almost half on the same period last year – 66,000 tons less, according to official data. In places, cartels have reportedly limited picking to just a few days a week to more easily manipulate prices. “The cartels impose the price of the lime, they decide whether or not to pick them,” an industry worker told Reforma newspaper. Some farmers have abandoned their fields to avoid dealing with the cartels amid serious harassment and fighting, while bandits have also been stealing large amounts of limes in transit. Others have reportedly been forcibly displaced. A producer in El Aguaje, Michoacán, told local media: “They took away our land, they took away our houses, they looted our lime orchards.” More than 2,800 Mexican army and national guard troops have been deployed to the state in an attempt to dampen the cartel violence after alleged JNGC members dug ditches to cut off a key road. It’s not just the lime trade which has been ensnared by cartels. A large majority of Mexico’s exports of avocados also come from Michoacán – the site of some of the fiercest battles following the launch of the militarised war on drugs in 2006. Prices of the “green gold” fruit are spiking. Already, it is rarely served at taquerías in large quantities unless guacamole is purchased separately. But there are fears that the costly lime could force widespread taco price hikes after some eateries moved to mitigate the growing expense from the citrus fruit. “These lime price rises were a long time coming,” said Gustavo Arellano, author of Taco USA: How Mexican Food Conquered America, who adds that cartels have been influencing fruit prices for years amid the growing popularity of Mexican food abroad. “It’s a perfect storm of problems with limes. And sadly, the American consumer only cares about their margarita and squeezing wedges of lime on their tacos. Limes and avocados have essentially become the edible version of drugs, due to the misery their growing consumption is causing.”",News/World news,Mexico lime inflation leaves sour taste as cartels gouge prices for cuisine staple,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/12/mexico-lime-prices-shortages-cartels
