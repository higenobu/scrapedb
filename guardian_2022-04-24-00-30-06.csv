4/24/2022,"The American fashion designer Alexander Wang last week staged his first catwalk show since being accused of several sexual assaults in 2020. Big-name models appeared on the catwalk while others packed out the front row. Kim Kardashian voiced her support on Instagram, writing “congrats on the amazing show”. The event, along with Rihanna being photographed last month wearing a bespoke black leather maternity outfit by Wang, and the actor Lucy Liu appearing in his recent resort campaign, has led industry onlookers to ask: why has fashion forgotten #MeToo? Speaking to the Observer about the show, one of Wang’s accusers, who wished to remain anonymous, said: “Some people don’t really care about what doesn’t affect them personally.” Such collective amnesia is not isolated. When the French fashion photographer Patrick Demarchelier (who was accused of sexual misconduct by seven unnamed women in 2018) died last month, eulogies poured in from the likes of Naomi Campbell, Claudia Schiffer and Christy Turlington, suggesting all had been forgotten – despite most fashion magazines and brands cutting ties with him when the allegations emerged. (Demarchelier always maintained his innocence and was never prosecuted.) In 2018, the New York Times accused the fashion photographers Mario Testino and Bruce Weber of repeated sexual exploitation, which they denied. Both have since staged a quiet return. Testino took Kardashian and her daughter’s portrait in 2019, and in 2020 hosted an exhibition in London attended by, among others, Kate Moss. Weber is inching back in too, with a coffee table book and a cover shoot for the current Icon magazine. Wang was accused by 11 people (all male or transgender) of variously groping them, drugging them and pulling their underwear down in public – allegations which the 38-year-old initially denied, calling them “baseless and grotesquely false”. After the accusers hired renowned lawyer Lisa Bloom (who represented Jeffrey Epstein’s victims), Wang met them and issued a public apology on Instagram, promising to “set a better example”. “Fashion never had its big #MeToo reckoning, and it still fails to support its victims of sexual abuse,” said fashion and culture writer Daniel W Rodgers. “There’s a culture within fashion of hero-worshipping its creators – so their poisonous behaviour is frequently excused as if they were misunderstood artists.” Commentator Caryn Franklin said: “They’re seen to be untouchable because beauty springs from their fingertips. Studies have shown we’re seduced by beauty. [Fashion] people agree to prioritise the optics over and above the context and subtext.” This means, added Rodgers, that “fashion’s hierarchy has gone unquestioned, with sexual exploitation being par for the course for a lot of young people. It’s still the same small cabal presiding over the industry. Those who would like to blacklist Wang, Weber and Testino simply don’t have the power to do so.” Franklin felt that experience first-hand, having first raised concerns about the fashion photographer Terry Richardson’s predatory behaviour in 2013 (it wasn’t until 2017 that magazine publisher Condé Nast terminated his contract). “I was on TV talking about it, I wrote about it in the national news, but I couldn’t seem to get anywhere for a while. “The fashion industry loves saying, ‘We’re edgy, we’re out there,’” she adds. “And if you bring your so-called ‘pedestrian’ values or ethics, then you’re discounted as someone who just doesn’t get it.” Money talks, too. “While fashion wants to tout its moral virtues, those quickly go out the window when cash comes into the equation,” said Mahoro Seward, fashion features editor at i-D. “There is so much wrapped up in the glamour and the freebies,” adds Rodgers. “It’s hard to say no, especially when the pay is so minimal for many in fashion.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,"As Alexander Wang basks in praise, has fashion shrugged off #MeToo?

4/24/2022,"The last year has been tricky for electric vehicle startups. After a burst of investment mania in which companies raised billions on the mere promise of battery propulsion, valuations have come back down to earth. One of the loudest thuds has come from Arrival, the closest to what could be called a British electric vehicle champion. Its market value on the Nasdaq has fallen from $15bn (£11.6bn) in March 2021, when it first completed a merger with a listed cash shell, to about $1.75bn. Almost all its startup rivals have suffered similar plunges, but Arrival is arguably a special case. The company is trying to move fast – launching a van, a bus and a car at the same time – and break the traditional industry model, using robot-controlled “microfactories” that it hopes will bounce manufacturers from the Henry Ford age to the iPhone era. The UK is key to those ambitions, and Arrival – founded by Russian entrepreneur Denis Sverdlov, incorporated in Luxembourg, listed in New York, but with research and development in the UK – is in turn an appropriate symbol for the hopes of the British automotive industry. Its first products are being developed in Banbury and built in Bicester, both in Oxfordshire, and the company wants Bicester to be the model for microfactories across the world. Now it just needs to make the thing work. That is proving harder than expected: delays mean it has had to halve forecasts for this year to 600 vans. “There are all sorts of people who are wondering if the microfactory will work,” says Mike Abelson, chief executive of Arrival Automotive, speaking from the Bicester shed, where half-wrapped robot arms stand poised to start work. “The only way to prove that is to produce the vehicles. We’ll be doing that this year, at rate and with quality. I’m very confident.” The factories will cost even less than the £100m Arrival initially suggested when it first emerged from “stealth mode” in 2019; the latest estimate, once it has the model working, is £38m. That pays for a microfactory theoretically capable of 10,000 cars a year – in contrast with the high hundreds of millions of pounds required for a traditional large-scale car plant. Arrival hopes to be able to install a new factory anywhere with a big enough shed (and market) in six to 12 months, compared with an industry that usually moves in seven-year cycles. “We don’t have to forecast four or five years in advance,” says Abelson. “This idea that we can react quickly to demand is a big advantage.” Demand is there, if it can deliver. Arrival has 60,000 orders for the van, which will be available with battery capacity options between 67 and 133kWh; the latter would give a 249-mile laden range, says Patrick Bion, an ex-Tesla engineer who is leading work on the van, which starts road trials this spring. Bion took the wheel for a short demonstration in the car park: the van moved quietly and relatively smoothly with a tight turning circle, although an inelegant lurch to a stop showed work was still needed. Production will be controlled by robots built by a former Nasa roboticist, with autonomous mobile platforms (cheerily named WeMos, short for “wheeled mobility”) ferrying the vehicles between six cells with robot arms arranged around them. The vans are made up of about 30 “Lego block” sub-assemblies, and the process aims to avoid complex and time-consuming joins such as welding. It is the same with the buses, which are made from 1.5-metre modules that can be mixed and matched to add more doors or seats. The car adds another intriguing direction. Arrival is working with Uber to design a hard-wearing vehicle for taxi-app drivers – although it will be sold on the open market, meaning some retail demand is likely as well. All the vehicles share many components, such as battery modules, inverters and drive units. They also use plastic composite body panels, which save weight and avoid huge, expensive metal presses. Using such fossil-fuel-based products is an uncomfortable trade-off for a company that makes a big deal of its green credentials, but Arrival says the panels are 100% recyclable. At its Banbury and Bicester facilities, the company still has a startup atmosphere, with employees gathering for lunch at a canteen right on the factory floor. There is little sense of hierarchy and people roam about – including Sverdlov, who bumps into the Observer briefly, before dashing off to test some prototypes after a nervous greeting. Later in the day he offers a few more words when our paths cross again. “We do something that’s never been done before,” he says. “I think we’re doing it quite successfully.” Sverdlov has for the most part avoided reporters when he can. He was born in the USSR, in what is now Georgia, and founded a software company in 2000, after graduating from university in St Petersburg. In 2007 he founded telecoms company Scartel, which also made the unusual Yota smartphones. He sold it in 2012 for $1.2bn, before taking a surprising step: he served just over a year in the cabinet of then Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev’s cabinet as a deputy minister for communications and mass m edia. The Observer’s visit to Arrival took place before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Sverdlov later said via a spokesperson that his days of moving in Moscow political circles were long past, and that he and his family had lived outside Russia since 2013. He has said that he has never met Vladimir Putin personally, and that he has “no connection to the Russian government in any form”. Scartel’s success brought him into contact with Russia’s wealthy class. Sergey Chemezov, a now-sanctioned telecoms oligarch and close friend of Putin, was seen as a supporter (but not a shareholder) of Yota, and the company was later bought by sanctioned billionaire Alisher Usmanov’s MegaFon. Most notably, Winter Capital, an investment fund founded by Russia’s richest man, Vladimir Potanin, holds a small stake in Arrival. Potanin was sanctioned by Canada earlier this month. Arrival declined to comment on Potanin, but said it was “against war of any kind”, in a statement, adding: “Arrival is saddened and concerned, like the rest of the world, about the impact of the situation on any communities involved in the ongoing conflict in the Ukraine.” The company is not reliant on Russian capital or materials. Arrival’s biggest investors are household-name companies from around the world, ranging from the world’s biggest investor, BlackRock, to UPS – the global delivery company, with which it has a van supply deal – and Korean carmaker Hyundai. Sverdlov, whose Kinetik fund still controls nearly three-quarters of the company, is clearly very closely involved in running Arrival. He instigated its whole “device on wheels” philosophy, Bion says. There will be two tests of Sverdlov’s success: first and most obviously, can Arrival make money? But second, will other automotive manufacturers be converted to the microfactory model? Even Tesla, the disruptor par excellence, has so far stuck with production lines. Arrival has discussed producing its vehicles on a traditional assembly line with Hyundai, but so far is sticking with the “micro” approach. “If you take the existing model and apply the microfactory to it, it won’t make sense,” says Bion. “Other [carmakers] could do it in this way, to simplify, but they don’t have the push to do that.”",News/Business,Britain’s Tesla hopes for big things from ‘microfactories’,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/23/britains-tesla-hopes-for-big-things-from-microfactories
4/24/2022,"Business has been better than expected this year for Paul Askew’s fine-dining restaurant in central Liverpool. He feared for its future amid the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation, but so far the punters have kept coming. “January is usually the quietest month,” says the chef patron of the Art School restaurant, where menus start at £39 a head. “But people were feeling liberated and came out in large numbers. The start of the year was better than we could have hoped, and that has continued.” Faced with the biggest hit to household incomes since modern records began in the 1950s, businesses across the UK are bracing for a slowdown in consumer spending, as the price of everything from gas and electricity to food and clothes soars. But experts say a two-speed consumer economy could emerge, with richer households, who saved record sums during lockdown, continuing to spend. The signs are there: as well as the rush back to restaurants there was a scramble to airports this Easter, and the housing market is booming. And all this is despite the worst inflation since at least 1992 and amid reports of growing use of food banks and rising fuel poverty. For Askew, bookings for May and June have slowed and he worries that tightened budgets could keep diners away. His costs are rising too: prices of beef and lamb are up more than a quarter, which could force him to increase menu prices. “I think as people see direct debits, energy bills and the weekly shop going up they will start to cut back,” he says. “That’s a worry.” His hope is that a lockdown savings glut and a desire to spend on experiences rather than physical goods after two years of life on hold will keep diners coming. “We may be insulated by the furlough effect, which has given some people more money in their pocket. That may help for three to six months. But it’s how long it goes on for that’s the big question.” So far the picture is mixed. Consumer confidence collapsed in April to its second-lowest level in almost 50 years, as energy prices and tax hikes added to the inflation squeeze. Retail sales fell by more than expected in March as skyrocketing food and fuel prices made shoppers tighten their belts. Some economists warn a summer recession may be on the cards. Part of the retail slump is down to consumers switching to spending on services after the end of restrictions. Supermarkets profited in lockdown, but now face tough competition as pubs, restaurants and travel rebound. Retail sales account for about a third of overall consumer spending. Credit and debit card figures from Barclaycard showed other forms of spending booming over the Easter weekend as Britons enjoyed days out in the sun. Restaurant sales rose by 116% compared with Easter 2021, and by more than a third on 2019. Pubs, bars and nightclubs saw a 74% jump on pre-Covid levels. Some economists think savings are helping. According to the Bank of England, more than £200bn was salted away during lockdown, but this was concentrated in the top 40% wealthiest households, and in occupations where home working was possible. Poorer households lost money in the pandemic and are also expected to see the biggest hit to their incomes. “The least affluent households will be disproportionately impacted because more of their income goes on food and energy,” said Richard Lim of consultancy Retail Economics. “It’s a very uneven picture.” Figures from accountant Deloitte confirm this. They show that 5% of households with income of £10,000 or less were able to save in the first three months of this year, compared with 38% of households with overall income of £100,000. While the economy could be helped by the spending of savings, analysts say it will still be under severe pressure and could come close to stalling as many people tighten their belts. Headwinds to come include higher interest rates and a further increase to the cap on gas and electricity bills this autumn. “Consumer confidence is flashing a big red warning sign,” said Robert Wood at Bank of America. “You don’t normally get confidence this low without consumers cutting back. And if they are, we may be quite close to recession. There’s a huge hit to real incomes.” Unlike some analysts, the US investment bank is not forecasting a recession because it expects business investment to rebound and some households to draw down their savings while others increase their borrowing. But consumers account for two-thirds of the UK economy, so the stakes are high. “If the consumer stops growing the economy generally stops growing,” Wood added. “It’s the biggest worry for this year.”",News/Business,Busy restaurants belie a tale of tightening belts in cost-of-living crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/23/restaurants-cost-of-living-crisis-consumer-spending
4/24/2022,"Singing instrumentalists, the ones who have to stop blowing in order to sing, have mostly been trumpeters. Louis Armstrong and Chet Baker come to mind, and Dizzy would oblige when the mood took him. Those with other instruments are much rarer. Malcolm Earle Smith is a noted British trombonist and this, his first vocal album, is no sudden whim but a long-contemplated labour of love. He recruited four of the sharpest young jazz musicians around today, former students at the music college where he teaches, as his accompanying band. He also wrote the arrangements, which are full of clever surprises and quite tricky at times. Perhaps most surprising of all is his singing style, involving both lyrics and wordless scat, which he carries off with aplomb. Altogether, there’s never a dull moment.

4/24/2022,"“Britain moves closer to a self-driving revolution,” said a perky message from the Department for Transport that popped into my inbox on Wednesday morning. The purpose of the message was to let us know that the government is changing the Highway Code to “ensure the first self-driving vehicles are introduced safely on UK roads” and to “clarify drivers’ responsibilities in self-driving vehicles, including when a driver must be ready to take back control”. The changes will specify that while travelling in self-driving mode, motorists must be ready to resume control in a timely way if they are prompted to, such as when they approach motorway exits. They also signal a puzzling change to current regulations, allowing drivers “to view content that is not related to driving on built-in display screens while the self-driving vehicle is in control”. So you could watch Gardeners’ World on iPlayer, but not YouTube videos of F1 races? Reassuringly, though, it will still be illegal to use mobile phones in self-driving mode, “given the greater risk they pose in distracting drivers as shown in research”. As usual, the announcement comes coated in three layers of prime political cant. This “exciting technology” is “developing at pace right here in Great Britain” (but apparently not in Northern Ireland; could it be that the DUP doesn’t approve of such advanced technology?). The government is “ensuring we have strong foundations in place for drivers when [the technology] takes to our roads”, which will be great once it has attended to the crumbling physical foundations of the roads in my neighbourhood. And of course it’s all happening “while boosting economic growth across the nation and securing Britain’s place as a global science superpower”. Quite so. But what exactly is this self-driving capability that is being enabled by our local superpower? Turns out it’s ALKS, which is an acronym for “automated lane keeping systems”, a interesting technology that “enables a vehicle to drive itself in a single lane, up to 37mph, while maintaining the ability to return control easily and safely to the driver when required”. Wow! Now for a reality check. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) defines six levels of driving automation, ranging from 0 (fully manual) to 5 (fully autonomous). Level 1 is where the car has a single system for driver assistance. Adaptive cruise control, where the vehicle is kept at a safe distance behind the next car, is an example, because the human driver monitors the other aspects of driving, such as steering and braking. Level 2 is “partial driving automation”. The car can control both steering and accelerating/decelerating. But it falls short of self-driving because a human sits in the driver’s seat and can take control of the car at any time. According to the SAE, the Tesla Autopilot and Cadillac Super Cruise systems both qualify as Level 2 on these criteria. So what the government calls ALKS is actually a slightly degraded version of Level 2 automation, because it’s confined to speeds of 37mph or less. I say “degraded” because I drive a Tesla and can testify that its ludicrously named Autopilot doesn’t confine itself to such modest velocities. On motorways and well-marked dual carriageways it’s good at keeping the car in the centre of whatever lane it’s in and it will brake to keep a safe distance from the car in front, then accelerate up to whatever maximum speed one has set for it if the road ahead is clear. But you are obliged to tweak the steering wheel every minute to confirm that you are actually in charge of the car and paying attention. And the minute you take it off a dual carriageway on to a standard rural road it really struggles, sometimes even manifesting a worrying interest in the roadside verge. So it’s useful in modest ways. A Tesla owner of my acquaintance, travelling on a motorway to collect his daughter from Heathrow, switched on Autopilot and settled down to slipstream behind a big truck at 60mph, thereby enabling him safely to think great thoughts while at the same time magically extending the range of his battery. It all went fine until his daughter rang, informing him that she had landed an hour ago and wondering where the hell he was! But to talk about this Level 2 automation as “self-driving” is quite a stretch, even for the Johnson government. We may one day get to Level 5 – to vehicles that do not require human attention and won’t even have steering wheels or acceleration/braking pedals. They will be free from geofencing, able to go anywhere and do anything that an experienced human driver can do. But it won’t happen just yet, no matter how much Elon Musk warbles about “full self-driving” coming imminently to Teslas. Still, it’s good to see the UK government trying to get ahead of a curve for a change. And while they’re waiting for Level 5, wouldn’t it be a good idea to fix the potholes and disintegrating surfaces of British roads so that those driverless cars can have a smooth ride when they finally arrive?

4/24/2022,"What did I eat when I had no kitchen of my own, and very little money? The answer is: the same thing every day. At the time, I was living in one room in a house in Glasgow. Don’t misunderstand: it was a lovely room in a beautiful house overlooking the Botanic Gardens. I liked it. But the kitchen was shared between five tenants, whose names I did not know and whose faces I rarely saw (I was working long hours). Each night, bone tired, I would dash to this kitchen, cook some pasta, smother it in a spoonful of pesto from a jar (a delicacy that was then an exciting new import to our islands), dust it with a little dry supermarket parmesan and – presto! – supper was served. At this point in my life, I’d never tasted fresh pesto, so I didn’t know what a poor substitute the long-lasting stuff was, though in any case, I liked this dish, which was filling and involved no mess or fuss. Its utter predictability – the end product never varied in the slightest degree – was soothing, and it was quite salty, and thus, to me, quite tasty (I love salt). But then again, I wouldn’t say that I wanted to eat it every night, let alone that I looked forward to it. It was only the result of my circumstances, a combination of limited resources and exhaustion. When the man with whom I was then having a thing took me out to dinner, I would eat like there was no tomorrow, roaming the menu like some crazed buffalo crisscrossing a prairie. It may be partly as a result of this time that, these days, I feel anxious and a bit embarrassed if I serve the same thing two days in a row, a state that somewhat baffles my adorable domestic colleague, who actively enjoys culinary repetition (before he met me, he happily dined almost exclusively on smoked salmon and brown bread). But there it is: unless a person has no choice – and I understand that some people don’t – I can’t imagine why anyone wouldn’t want to eat as varied a diet as possible. The only time I feel differently is when there are leftovers that actively improve with time, something that applies to stews, and also, I think, to trifle, which is really good for breakfast the morning after the night before (so shoot me). Doesn’t everyone feel like this? Apparently not. In a rival newspaper, a young columnist described how freeing it is not to have to make decisions in the matter of supper, for which reason he only ever cooks some kind of fried aubergine dish with paprika and yoghurt. He told me later on social media (I was outraged, and had come after him, poor guy) not only that this concoction – picture a bowl of spicy slugs, floating in whiteness – is delicious, but that he’s convinced lots of people eat something similar, and on most nights of the week. Hmm. At this point, I thought of a recipe from beloved Katharine Whitehorn’s 1961 classic Cooking in a Bedsitter: The Dish, so called because she and her flatmate at one point cooked almost nothing else for two years (made of braising steak, vegetables and tomato puree, it is slow-cooked and served with rice). Can this guy be right, or is he a crackpot. Where is he getting his information? I know some dubious survey or other once found that a third of Britons eat the same lunch daily. But dinner? (Or tea, if you prefer – which I still do, secretly.) Surely not. Life, which is hard, is about small pleasures; it’s about what Victorian writers such as George Gissing and John Ruskin used to call – with such relish – morsels and dainties. The older I get, the more I want to really savour things, and I don’t think this is possible, after a certain point, in the case of foods that are eaten over and over. Such mechanical, unimaginative consumption leads in the end only to ennui and melancholy. The taste buds grow dull, and the jaw listless – and it’s a slippery slope. The next stop, once you’ve rolled all the way down it, is food eaten straight from the can, or a boil-in-the-bag curry that reeks more of desperation than it does of cumin.",Lifestyle/Food,Life is about small pleasures.

4/24/2022,"The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, has said dyslexia caused her to mix up her words and suggest people “downstream” movies and play on “tennis pitches”. The cabinet minister responsible for regulating the internet said her impediment, which according to the NHS mainly causes problems with reading and writing, means she can find it difficult to find the correct expression when speaking. “I have dyslexia, which means that when I speak I often run my words together and say things that sound like the words I’m trying to say. Sometimes it’s funny and I laugh it off … but mostly, it’s just difficult,” Dorries said. “I’m OK with that. I’ve been in politics a long time and you grow a thick skin. It’s why I haven’t spoken publicly much about how it affects me. But I’ve found it tough seeing commentators and media outlets mock me for something that is beyond my control. For other dyslexia sufferers, we learn that it’s what you achieve in life that counts, not what those who mock you say.” She misspoke in a short TikTok video posted to the account of Conservative MP Luke Jones, in which she explained the responsibilities of her government department. “We’re responsible for making sure you have superfast broadband in your home, that means you can downstream your movies,” she said. Dorries added that her government department is “responsible for everything to do with sport, making sure you’ve got football pitches and that you have tennis pitches in your communities where you can play and exercise your sport”.

His interaction with the referee, Aurélie Groizeleau, and other officials was also called into question. The three charges Rayner faced were allowing the player to return to the field when an HIA had been called for (A), interfering with the HIA process and on-field decision making (B) and disrespectful conduct towards the officials (C). A Six Nations statement read: “The committee noted that in respect of charge A and B, Dr Rayner’s actions were grave and found that the HIA protocol is mandatory and must be complied with by all concerned. “The independent judicial committee was unanimously of the view that an entry point of eight weeks would be appropriate regarding charges A and B. Regarding charge C, Dr Rayner’s actions towards the [match day doctor] were found to be unacceptable and not in the spirit of the game, and the judicial committee decided upon a two-week suspension, those two weeks to run concurrently with the eight-week suspension for charges A and B. “The independent Judicial Committee applied full mitigation (50%) based on Dr Rayner’s previous impeccable record and acknowledgement of culpability, leaving a total suspension of four weeks.”",Sport/Sport,England under-20s doctor gets four-week ban after head injury furore,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/23/england-under-20s-doctor-gets-four-week-ban-after-head-injury-furore
