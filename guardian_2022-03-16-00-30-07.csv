3/16/2022,"Idaho has become the first US state to pass an abortion ban modeled after a controversial Texas law that prohibits abortions after about six weeks or when a heartbeat is detected. The news comes with abortion rights under assault across the US – despite clear majority support for such rights. The conservative-dominated US supreme court is thought likely to overturn Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling which established the right, later this year. On Monday, Idaho house members passed the ban 51-14. No Democrats supported the legislation. The Senate has approved the bill and the Republican governor, Brad Little, is expected to sign it. Abortion rights groups called on Little to use his veto. Planned Parenthood called the bill a copycat of the Texas bill that became law last May and was controversially left in place by the supreme court. “Idaho’s anti-abortion lawmakers ignored public opinion and rushed through this legislation, looking to capitalize on the US supreme court’s failure to block Texas’s ban,” Planned Parenthood said, adding that the bill’s proponents have been open about wanting Idaho to become “the next Texas”. Jennifer M Allen, chief executive of Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates, an Idaho nonprofit, said: “Little must do the right thing, listen to the medical community and veto this legislation before it forces Idaho patients to leave the state for critical, time-sensitive care or remain pregnant against their will.” The Idaho bill would also allow family members to sue doctors who perform procedures after six weeks of pregnancy, before most people know they are pregnant. The bill provides a minimum reward of $20,000 plus legal fees within four years of the abortion for successful suits, compared to minimum $10,000 and legal costs under the Texas law. Unlike the Texas law, the Idaho bill provides some exceptions in cases of rape or incest. While a rapist could not sue practitioners under Idaho’s new bill, family members could. Victims would have to file a police report and provide it to a doctor before they could get the procedure. “This bill is not clever, it’s absurd,” said Democratic representative Lauren Necochea, adding that the rape and incest exemptions were “not meaningful”. Last year, Little signed a “heartbeat” bill into law, but it included a “trigger provision” that stopped it being in effect until a federal court approved it, which has not happened. Several Republican-run states have taken steps to restrict abortion rights. Among them, bills in Missouri would permit lawsuits against those who help someone cross state lines to get an abortion. Terminating non-viable pregnancies would be a criminal offense. The Oklahoma senate recently passed six anti-abortion measures, including a copycat of the Texas ban. In February, the Arizona senate passed an abortion ban that would prohibit the procedure after 15 weeks, similar to the law passed in Mississippi, which is expected to lead the supreme court to overturn Roe v Wade.",News/US news,Idaho copies extreme Texas law and bans abortion after six weeks,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/15/idaho-abortion-ban-texas-law-six-weeks

3/16/2022,"It’s no secret that the first European modernists were obsessed with Japan. In Manet’s Portrait of Zola, the novelist has a print of a wrestler by Utagawa Kuniaki II and a painted Japanese screen in his study. The Japanese artists most imitated by the likes of Van Gogh and Whistler were woodblock printmakers such as Hiroshige and Hokusai who had flourished in the early 1800s. It’s a curious mirror image to see how, while they looked east, their contemporary Kawanabe Kyōsai was looking west. His paintings on scrolls and woodblock prints, made from the 1850s to his death in 1889, are full of witty portraits of Europeans and a not always happy marriage of Japanese and western styles. The Japan into which Kyōsai was born had kept its borders closed for centuries. His lifetime saw the first visit by an American fleet, the end of the Tokugawa shogunate that had restricted foreign contact, the legalisation of Christianity and the coming of railways and the telegraph. He’s constantly making satirical swipes at these changes. In one picture Jesus is portrayed on the cross, holding a fan. In another Mr Punch, from Punch magazine, features as a demon. More demons attend a strict western-style school in a satire on educational reforms. Yet in spite of Kyōsai’s apparent ambivalence about all these new western ways, he enthusiastically embraces European art. He seems to have seen a lot of English satirical prints – not just Punch but the earlier, wilder art of James Gillray and Thomas Rowlandson. In his painting Party in a Hotel in Suez, Japanese people mingle with European travellers in a boozy cosmopolitan gathering that’s like Hogarth on sake. Apparently Kyōsai was extremely fond of the sake. There’s a whole bunch of paintings here that he did with dozens of friends at art festivals, drinking as they drew. The results are quirky and engaging. In one scroll painting, Kyōsai contrasts peoples of the world: a European couple, with the man in a top hat, Kyōsai’s universal attribute of western males, along with Inuit, Chinese, Indonesian and Thai people, who are all watched curiously by a Japanese couple. He’s registering the human carnival to which Japan has opened itself. In a woodblock print from 1863 called Foreigners and Samurai, outsiders directly confront the traditional Japanese elite, as howling and grimacing Europeans point angrily at cross-legged samurai, with swords, who grin, mock and look tough in return. As the catalogue explains, Japan was under pressure at the time to compensate Britain for the killing of a merchant. European battleships menaced Yokohama to demand the fine. Kyōsai is appealing to popular opinion that was nationalist and pro-samurai. Satirical art is difficult to exhibit because you need to know its context: Gillray’s scathing comments on Georgian politics often need so much explication the humour dies among texts. This exhibition spurns long explanatory labels for a highly aesthetic display in three long rooms in protectively lowered lighting. But the detailed political commentary you can find in the catalogue is in fact necessary to understand it all. Without that, you are drawn to simpler, bolder images such as a painting of Shōki the demon-queller, eyes glaring, sword arm flexed: or a series of arrestingly real depictions of squat crows perching on branches. These crows are uneasily modern in their raw, stark realism. His huge Night Procession of One Hundred Demons, painted across two screens of six panels each, is a wild, hilarious comedy depicting a legend that if pots, pans and other household items are left for a century, they come to monstrous life. The creatures have plates, scrolls, lampshades still stuck in their freakish anatomies. Yet there’s a sense of loss and disappointment. While Japanese art was helping European painters escape their obsession with mundane reality, Kyōsai’s fantastic imagination is blunted by touches of European pedantry. His attempts to imitate English caricature are fun, yet you can see the originality and power of the tradition he works in starting to ebb away, curbed by the need to be more western. Japan was never conquered by Europe but its art seems to surrender here to the tyranny of the top hat. That makes Kyōsai an intriguing figure from history but not an artist who uplifts us like a great wave.

3/16/2022,"Scientists are launching a trial of a new scanning technique that could identify women at high risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including stillbirth and pre-eclampsia, by analysing their placentas. The technology uses artificial intelligence to analyse ultrasound images taken during women’s 12-week scan and assign them a risk score – similar to the first trimester risk assessment for Down’s syndrome routinely offered at this point in women’s pregnancies. Those deemed at high risk could be offered additional scans or drugs to reduce their risk of adverse outcomes. Each day, approximately eight families in the UK are affected by stillbirth, with foetal growth restriction – a condition where the baby is smaller than expected, or its growth slows or stops during pregnancy – the single biggest risk factor. Meanwhile, approximately 6% of pregnant women develop pre-eclampsia – a condition that causes high blood pressure or problems with the liver or kidneys – which can be serious if untreated. Both conditions are thought to be related to problems with the placenta, the jelly-like organ linking the foetus’s blood supply to the mother’s. Some hospitals within the NHS are beginning to introduce a screening algorithm that uses routinely collected antenatal data, including an ultrasound measure of uterine blood supply, to calculate women’s risk of pre-eclampsia, which could enable doctors to intervene with additional screening, or early delivery of the baby where necessary. The new approach aims to build on this algorithm, by incorporating additional AI-based assessments of the placenta’s volume, and the blood vessels supplying it. “Many studies have shown that if you have a small placenta in the first trimester, you will have a small placenta at term, and a small placenta makes a small baby,” said Prof Sally Collins, a consultant obstetrician and medical lead for women’s health at Perspectum Ltd, an Oxford University spin-out company that is developing the technology. “If your placenta is small, and has a normal supply of blood vessels (vascularity), it can be an indication of foetal growth restriction. If it is small with low vascularity, you potentially get a small baby and preeclampsia.” Although the placenta can be visualised using ultrasound, measuring it, and all the tiny blood vessels supplying it, is extremely time consuming, making this impractical for routine early pregnancy screening. So the University of Oxford has used machine learning to develop a tool, trained on thousands of ultrasound images where the placenta has been painstakingly marked out by hand, to automate the recognition process. “What we’ve come up with is a fully automated, artificial intelligence method for seeing and measuring the placenta, and the blood supply at its interface with the uterus, so suddenly, we have a computer tool that can tell you the size and the vascularity of the placenta in real time,” Collins said. A pilot study in 143 women suggested the tool could differentiate between those with pre-eclampsia and foetal growth restriction. The new trial, launched this week , will test whether integrating this information into the existing NHS algorithm can further improve its accuracy. It aims to recruit 4,000 women who will be offered a placental ultrasound at their 12-week appointment, alongside routine care, and then followed up to see if the improved algorithm’s predictions are correct.",News/Science,Trial begins of AI scan that could reduce risk of stillbirth and other conditions,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/15/placenta-analysis-trial-seeks-to-identify-adverse-pregnancy-outcome-risk
3/16/2022,"This balanced, thoughtful documentary tells the story of Extinction Rebellion from the inside. It’s directed by first-timers Maia Kenworthy and Elena Sánchez Bellot, who capture the anything-is-possible euphoria of the first wave of protests in April 2019 – activists feeling on the right side of history, no longer powerless and alone with their anxieties about climate change. One of the activists is Farhana Yamin, an environmental lawyer who superglued herself to Shell’s headquarters in London. A seriously impressive no-nonsense woman, she has spent more than two decades trying to make a difference from the inside, attending nearly every major climate summit since 1991. Frustrated by the blah blah blah and inaction (and the lobbying funded by the fossil fuel industry), she joins the protesters. Her husband beams with pride as the police arrive. Her son taps into his phone: “Mum is being arrested outside Shell” (presumably on the family’s WhatsApp group). The film-makers chronicle the inner tensions at XR with fairness and sensitivity – this is a documentary that you feel you can trust. One of XR’s co-founders Roger Hallam, an organic farmer, becomes a splintering figure. His laser focus and stubbornness, so vital in starting a movement from scratch, begins to look self-righteous and blinkered. When XR members oppose flying drones close to Heathrow, he says it’s his job to be unpopular. It’s painful watching footage of angry rush-hour commuters confronting XR protesters glued to a train in east London. Social media reactions flash up on screen: “Middle class telling working class what to do.” Hallam falls out with his daughter Savannah, who, like other young protesters, seems to feel frozen out of decision-making at XR. Activists of colour and others feel passionately about putting climate justice at the centre of the transition to renewable energy. Children as young as five are mining cobalt for solar panels and electric cars, says one woman. “I don’t want the same world but eco.” This is a film that gets a lot done in less than 90 minutes – it could easily have run to double that length. There’s only a bit here on the police crackdown on XR, which does lead to a wonderfully English moment in which an officer stops a woman who looks to be in her 60s. He suspects that she might be harbouring items that could be used in criminal damage.

3/16/2022,"Two days after Russian forces entered Ukraine, on 26 February, the country’s public military administration requested that a psychological support system be put in place at Lviv train station. Thousands of women and children were passing through the station, 80km (50 miles) from the border with Poland, and the need for doctors and psychiatrists to support the displaced was immediately clear. “The first week was very difficult,” says Dr Orest Suvalo, psychiatrist and coordinator of the support centre. “There were people arriving from Kyiv and Kharkiv who showed critical signs of distress. Many children, but also adults, were panicking, looking for shelters and buses to Poland.’’ Mental health workers and doctors in Lviv report that thousands of Ukrainian refugee children displaced by the war are showing severe symptoms of trauma. “I have seen children here with catatonic symptoms, where they kind of freeze and don’t react to any outside stimulation,” says Dr Viktor Balandin, psychologist for the Ukrainian NGO Osonnya. “Many of them have stopped speaking, others cannot move their hands or fingers. They just freeze.” Since the Russian invasion began, millions of Ukrainian children have had to abandon their schools, toys and games. They have been forced to leave their bedrooms to move into bomb shelters, basements and refugee facilities. The war has also killed their peers; according to Ukraine’s general prosecutor, 90 children have died so far. The trauma of the conflict runs deep for young people who are displaced, with many, if not most of them, bearing the psychological scars of terror. Mental health doctors in Ukraine say the sudden absence of fathers, forced to remain in the country after the government applied martial law banning men aged 18-60 from leaving, has also had a significant impact on children’s lives. “For younger children, up to two or three years old, their mental health conditions depend on the condition of their parents, usually the mother,” says Balandin. “If the mother is in an emotionally stable condition, their children will also be more stable. While, for teenagers, things are different, because they already understand what’s going on. At their age, teenagers are naturally processing, adapting and accepting their own egos. But too much change in their life means more difficulties to adapt to and accept.” Beyond the train station, those who work in the arts have responded to the need for therapeutic support. Bohdan Tykholoz, director of the Franko Museum in Lviv, welcomes about 1,000 children every day to the theatre he runs with a team of child psychologists, artists, musicians and teachers. Children are engaged in art and music activities in order to offer them a bit of normality and a space to play. “The idea was born when my two children and my wife had to leave the country and move to Germany, immediately after the conflict began,” says Tykholoz, who has named the project Fun for Courage. “My wife made a list of things she needed. The first was a hairdryer. The second: papers, markers and coloured pencils – anything they could use to create things they needed the most. When I realised the most urgent need for my children was to create, to draw, I immediately thought of this project. I told myself, ‘if I can’t help my children, because they are far away, I can help other children.’’’ Kateryna Sukhorebska, who is running art activities for displaced children in her bookshop in Lviv, says children are painting the reality of war: “They draw bombs and tanks, because that’s what they see with their own eyes. But there is also hope in their drawings, and the wish for peace and victory.” The treatment of some of these mental health disorders requires immediate and constant therapy, but many Ukrainian children are constantly on the move. They are travelling long distances, on foot, by train, car and bus. Their families are forced to change dormitories, day after day. They are forced to stand in queues of people and vehicles stretching for miles before crossing the borders into Poland or Romania, waiting in the cold for up to 40 hours. Suvalo explains that often his team do not have time to diagnose mental health disorders before the children have left the clinic, bound for another village or for Poland. “I suppose that in western countries they will receive a lot of proper care,” he says. “If these children can live in a stable environment, they may also be able to convert these traumas into resilience, as is the history of our Ukrainian people. “If you look at the history of Ukraine, in the 20th and 21st centuries, it is full of great traumas. The first world war, the second world war, the Soviet occupation, and the internal revolutions of the last ten years, up until this terrible invasion. Yet, despite these wars, despite the destruction, despite the bombs and tragedies, despite everything, we are still alive.” In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

3/16/2022,"Almost 89,000 people in Britain have offered homes to Ukrainian refugees in the first hours of a government scheme that allows families and individuals to bring them to the UK. The scheme means those who do not have a family connection to the UK can come to the country on a visa for the first time. You can host a refugee family if you live in the UK – regardless of your nationality. Non-Britons must have at least six months’ leave to remain in the UK. The first step is to apply through the government website, which almost 90,000 people have already done. Applications can also be made on behalf of charities, faith and community groups or businesses. There will be some “light-touch” vetting of hosts, probably not a full DBS check. More detailed guidance is expected to be released in the coming days. Hosts will receive £350 a month tax free for up to 12 months, with one payment made per address, not per individual. The government will not be matching British hosts with Ukrainians. Those who are approved as hosts will need to identify the Ukrainians they intend to host and then they will make a visa application naming their intended hosts. However, in practice, many of those who are offering to host Ukrainians simply will not know anyone directly that might wish to come here. There are a number of charities who are asking people to register their interest with them and who can undertake some of the matching process. They include: Sanctuary Foundation – which is running online information events for hosts Refugees at Home, a charity that has experience connecting refugees and hosts online Room for Refugees, which has previously settled unaccompanied child refugees Reset, which also has a sponsorship scheme for refugees from other conflicts World Jewish Relief, which runs a number of projects in Ukraine. Once hosts are approved and they are in touch with a Ukrainian individual or family you wish to sponsor, they can fill in a visa application. That process is not yet open – it will start on 18 March. After a change in the rules last week, those with a valid Ukraine passport will be able to apply online. But without those documents, which many fleeing may have left behind, refugees have to visit a visa centre in other European countries, including many bordering Ukraine such as Poland, Romania or Moldova, but also in other countries like Belgium or France. There is no visa centre in Calais, despite many Ukrainians turning up at the port hoping for help to enter the UK. Those who are granted a visa will be eligible to work and have the right to access state benefits and public services, such as schools and healthcare. Charities and other community organisations will be organising to help refugees access the benefits and services they are entitled to. The majority of those arriving are likely to be women and children, with men between 18 and 60 barred from leaving Ukraine in order to support the military. Local authorities will also receive £10,500 in extra funding per refugee and more funding will be available to ensure school places for children. However, some local councils have expressed concern that further funding is likely to be needed in order to meet the needs of people likely to have experienced severe trauma and those with caring responsibilities towards children and elderly people, given that most men have been ordered to stay in Ukraine. Hosts are expected to provide a private bedroom, rather than a shared room. The government has made clear the £350 is not intended to be a full rental payment – more a goodwill gesture to cover additional costs of having a family use your home. The scheme does not expect hosts to cover food and other necessities, that should be covered by refugees themselves who will have access to the benefit systems and be able to work. However, there’s nothing to stop hosts from offering food and whatever else they would like to offer. It’s likely that councils will treat the offer of homes to refugees with compassion rather than enforcement actions but in normal circumstances there are restrictions on how people can offer homes and to how many people. Christian Fox at Becket Chambers, who said he would offer free legal advice to those seeking to house Ukrainian refugees, said that offering anything other than a room in the main home – such as an annex above a garage or a cabin or a separate flat – could create a legal “tenancy”. “If the owner of a second home or investment property were to allow several families to stay in a property, it may give rise to the need to register as a House in Multiple Occupation (HMO) under the Housing Act 2004,” he said. “While we might hope that local authorities would be sympathetic, unless the government scheme allows exemption, then at the very least licensing will need to be investigated with the local council and their views sought.” Fox said there were fewer legal complications for people offering a room but said it could still affect property insurance or risk breaching mortgage or lease terms, which hosts would need to clarify with their lender or landlord.",News/World news,Homes for Ukraine: what do I need to do to host refugees in the UK?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/homes-for-ukraine-what-do-i-need-to-do-to-host-refugees-in-the-uk
3/16/2022,"HSBC is to shut a further 69 branches, on top of the 82 it axed last year, claiming the pandemic has accelerated the shift to digital banking. It is the latest in a line of banks to announce it is reducing its network in response to changing customer habits. Consumer organisation Which? said the number of closures during the last few years was “alarming” and that millions of people were not yet ready or able to go fully digital. Early last year HSBC had 593 branches, but the latest round of closures – scheduled to take place between mid-July and early October – will take that down to 441, of which 96 are described as “full service” outlets offering a comprehensive range of services. The 69 branches that are closing are spread across the UK, from Inverness in the Scottish Highlands to Falmouth in Cornwall. Those being axed include branches in high-profile London locations such as New Bond Street, Moorgate, Angel Islington and Gloucester Road in South Kensington – areas that are likely to have seen a reduction in footfall during the pandemic, when millions of the capital’s employees turned to working from home. HSBC said the decision to “reshape” its network was in response to an increasing preference for mobile and online banking. Fewer than half of its customers now actively use the branch network, with average footfall falling by more than 50% since 2017, said a spokesperson. The closures mean the average distance a customer will have to travel to a branch to speak to a real person will be four miles. Jenny Ross, the money editor at Which?, said: “There has been an alarming number of bank branch closures in recent years, and many consumers who rely on banks to access cash for everyday essentials and face-to-face services will be concerned about what these latest closures mean for them.” A series of branch closures have been announced during the pandemic, with financial institutions insisting customers are spurning traditional counter service in favour of online banking. In November 2021, TSB announced it was closing a further 70 branches. Last October, Lloyds Banking Group said it would be closing a further 48 branches, while in September, Virgin Money announced it was shutting 31 outlets for good. Ross said Which? urged the government to make good on its promise to bring in legislation to ensure consumers would continue to be able to access cash for as long as it was needed. HSBC said all of the branches that were closing had a post office within 1.5 miles, and that 90% had 10 or more free-to-use ATMs within one mile. It added that it would be refurbishing branches in important locations, installing new integrated deposit and withdrawal cash machines, holding pop-up events in local libraries and community halls, and providing free tablet devices to some vulnerable customers.",News/Business,HSBC to close 69 more bank branches as Covid speeds shift online,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/15/hsbc-close-bank-branches-covid-london
3/16/2022,"Families of some of those killed in the Manchester Arena bombing have said they hope “real changes” will be made to stop future terror attacks, as the inquiry into the atrocity ends. The inquiry began in September 2020 and heard its final submissions on Tuesday after 196 days of often harrowing evidence. Twenty-two people died on 22 May 2017 when Salman Abedi, a 22-year-old born and bred in Manchester with Libyan roots, detonated a suicide bomb hidden in his rucksack. Kim Harrison, a lawyer from Slater 7 Gordon who represents the families of 12 of the 22 victims, praised the bereaved for their “dignity, patience and great strength”. She said: “With each chapter of the inquiry heard our clients have had to sit and listen to a catalogue of organisational failings at every turn – from failings with the running of the arena and its security and medical provision, to failings of the emergency services on the night and latterly to the failures of the security services including MI5 and CPT [counter-terror police] to keep their loved ones safe that night. “Learning how badly their loved ones were failed by all those organisations has greatly exacerbated their grief and suffering.” She thanked members of the public and some of the emergency services who committed “acts of true heroism” to step in selflessly to help in what was a very dangerous situation. She added: “The families we represent desperately want something positive to come from this inquiry and for real changes to be made to keep members of the public safer from acts of terrorism in the future.” The inquiry is aiming to publish its second report, which examines the actions of the emergency services, before the parliamentary summer recess, set provisionally for 22 July. Volume 3, which looks at the security services, will be published separately later in the year. The first report, published by the chairman of the inquiry last year, found that Abedi should have been identified as a security threat on the night of the attack. Sir John Saunders found there were “serious shortcomings” and a number of missed opportunities by those in charge of security to prevent the attack. Saunders said he considered it likely Abedi would still have detonated his device if confronted, “but the loss of life and injury is highly likely to have been less”. Harrison said: “On behalf of those we represent, we urge the inquiry to be equally clear-sighted and brave in its chapter 2 and 3 reports dealing with the actions of the emergency services and the security services, to ensure that real change is effected and this country becomes a safer place out of this dreadful act of terror.”",News/UK news,Families hope for ‘real changes’ as Manchester Arena inquiry ends,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/15/families-hope-for-real-changes-as-manchester-arena-inquiry-ends
3/16/2022,"A man in Yonkers, New York was arrested for attempted murder after he punched an Asian woman 125 times and called her a racial slur, police said. The 67-year-old victim was entering her apartment building on Friday evening when the perpetrator, whom police identified as 42-year-old Tammel Esco, saw her and called her an “Asian bitch”, Yonkers police said. The assault was captured on surveillance video, which has been widely shared online. The victim ignored the comment, went into the vestibule of the building and tried to open the second door to the lobby. Esco approached her from behind, punched her head, knocked her to the floor, stood over her and punched her in the head and face repeatedly. He also stomped on her seven times and spat on her, police said. The victim, who was not identified, suffered multiple contusions and lacerations to her head and face and bleeding on the brain. Admitted to hospital, she was listed in stable condition. A witness said she called 911. “I started knocking on the door, and when I did that it caught his attention, and that’s when he got off of her,” Yvette Crespo told NBC New York. “He went out that door, went to the corner [and] put his hands up.” When police arrived, they found and arrested Esco without incident. He was charged with one count of attempted murder as a hate crime and assault in the second degree involving a victim 65 or older. Some tenants said the suspect was a building resident. One told ABC 7: “I had an altercation with him, me not physically, but something he did to my granddaughter. I don’t understand how he came back out here after he did what he did. He stalked her and threw her through that window over there.” According to Yonkers police, Esco has 14 previous arrests, half on felony charges. In February 2021, he pushed a woman through a plate glass window and was given conditional discharge with no jail time. In 2011, he was convicted of assault and sentenced to three years in prison. He was released on parole after two and a half years. “This is one of the most appalling attacks I have ever seen; to beat a helpless woman is despicable and targeting her because of her race makes it more so,” said the Yonkers police commissioner, John Mueller. “This defendant must be held to the maximum punishment allowed by law to send a clear message that hateful, violent behavior will not be tolerated in our communities.” The Yonkers mayor, Mike Spano, said: “Hate crimes are beyond intolerable in our city … I expect the suspect to be charged to the fullest extent of the law for his heinous actions. I continue to keep the victim and her family in our thoughts and prayers.” Esco was being held without bail at the Westchester county jail. The attack comes amid reports of increasing attacks on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in and around New York. According to data compiled by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, anti-AAPI hate crime was up 339% across the US last year.",News/US news,"New York man arrested after punching Asian woman 125 times, police say",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/15/yonkers-new-york-man-arrested-attacking-asian-woman
3/16/2022,"Few architects have experienced such a meteoric rise, against such odds, as Francis Kéré. Born in a remote village in Burkina Faso without running water or electricity, he began his career by building a mud-brick school for his community, before being selected to design the country’s national parliament less than 15 years later. Now he continues his unparalleled trajectory, named as the winner of the 2022 Pritzker prize, architecture’s highest international accolade. “It is unbelievable,” said Kéré, speaking from his office in Berlin. “I don’t know how this all happened. First of all I am happy and overwhelmed, but the prize also brings a great sense of responsibility. My life is not going to be easier.” He is the first black architect to be recognised in the prestigious award’s 43-year history, reflecting the profession’s overwhelmingly white, male, middle-class bias – a product of systemic discrimination that still plagues the industry. “I don’t want to talk about racism directly,” he said, “but this is a field where you need a lot of resources. You really need to be strong and be lucky, as competitions are not always so open. I hope that young people in Africa will see me and know that this is a possible path for them too.” Kéré has made a name for himself with a series of schools and medical facilities in Africa that appear grown out of their context, built by local communities with the bare minimum of resources. Often featuring walls of clay-earth bricks, shaded by large, overhanging corrugated metal roofs, his buildings are elegantly tuned to their arid climate – whether in Mali, Togo, Kenya, Mozambique or Sudan – using natural cooling to avoid the need for air conditioning. “Francis Kéré’s entire body of work shows us the power of materiality rooted in place,” said the Pritzker jury, chaired this year by Chilean activist-architect Alejandro Aravena. “His buildings, for and with communities, are directly of those communities – in their making, their materials, their programmes and their unique characters. They have presence without pretence and an impact shaped by grace.” Born in Gando in 1965, Kéré was the oldest son of the village chief – a privileged status that is still marked on his face in the form of radial tribal scars representing the sun’s rays. He was the first in his community to attend school, sent away at the age of seven, after which he won a scholarship to study woodwork in Germany. He saw slim prospects for a career in carpentry in a country that had little wood, so he switched to study architecture at the Technical University of Berlin. For his final project he designed a primary school for his home village – and set about fundraising and mobilising friends and family to see it built. It was realised in 2001, for about £20,000. “I knew I had a duty to my people,” he said. “I wanted to do everything I could to find an adequate technique for building a school, with climate conditions to give basic comfort for true teaching, learning and excitement.” He was motivated by his own experience of school, trapped in a cement-block classroom for hours on end with poor ventilation and little daylight. Kéré’s Gando primary school set out the basic principles that would go on to define his work, using earth bricks made on site, topped with a perforated ceiling crowned by a thin “flying roof”. While the corrugated metal roofs of many Burkinabe village houses make them intolerably hot inside, Kéré suspended his metal canopy above the classrooms to encourage stack ventilation, drawing cool air in through the building’s side windows and releasing hot air through the holes in the ceiling. The whole village was involved in construction: children gathered stones for the foundations while women brought water for the brick production, beginning a collaborative model of practice that he has continued ever since. The school won an Aga Khan award in 2004, catapulting Kéré to international fame and prompting him to found his practice in Berlin the following year. “One invitation came after another,” he said. “Not for buildings but for paid conferences, which helped me subsidise the work and continue fundraising for more projects back home.” He expanded the Gando school with teachers’ housing, arranged in a curved courtyard reminiscent of a traditional village compound, followed by an extension to the school in 2008, and a library in 2015 featuring light-wells made by sawn clay pots cast into the ceiling. International commissions including the Serpentine pavilion in 2017, and an installation for the Coachella music festival in 2019, have continued to help him raise funds and awareness of his work in Africa. The Aga Khan connection led to projects in Mali, including redevelopment of the national park in the capital, Bamako, and a centre for earth architecture in Mopti, both completed in 2010 to mark 50 years of independence. Back in Burkina Faso, Kéré began to experiment with different materials. For a secondary school in Koudougou in 2016 he used local laterite stone, to absorb the heat in daytime and radiate it back out at night, paired with a second facade of eucalyptus wood to create shaded spaces between the classrooms where students could gather between lessons. His design for the first phase of the Burkina Institute of Technology in 2020, also in Koudougou, saw cooling clay walls cast in-situ to speed up the building process, along with louvered classroom walls for better ventilation and eucalyptus used to line the expressive zigzag metal roof.Kéré continues to experiment with natural alternatives to air conditioning, most recently for a technology campus in Kenya, completed last year, which features wind towers inspired by the forms of nearby termite mounds. “I am constantly looking,” he said. “I am not limiting myself with a formal language.” Unusually for a recipient of the Pritzker prize, which is often considered a lifetime achievement award, Kéré’s most ambitious buildings are still to come. Current projects include the new Goethe Institute in Senegal, a museum in Rwanda and a towering civic centre for the university campus in Munich, where he holds a professorship. His biggest project so far, for the national assembly of Benin, is currently under construction, rising out of the ground in the capital, Porto-Novo, in the form of a majestic palaver tree. “The site is next to a botanic garden,” he said, “so we proposed to extend the garden and place the biggest tree in the centre, with a debate hall beneath the figurative tree canopy – reflecting how democracy has always been conducted in west Africa.” His equivalent project back home, for the national assembly of Burkina Faso in Ouagadougou, is now hanging in the balance, after the president was removed by a military coup in January. Kéré was commissioned in 2015, following a national uprising when the parliament was torched and the then-president hounded out of the country. He conceived the new building as a sloping ziggurat, covered with planted terraces, where people would be able to sit and enjoy elevated views across the city – symbolically climbing above the politicians. “I want the people to take ownership over the parliament building,” he said, “so that, one day, when the next revolution comes, they will protect it as their own.” Francis Kéré will be in conversation with Oliver Wainwright and Asta Gröting at the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin on Wednesday.",Arts/Art and design,‘It is unbelievable’: Francis Kéré becomes first black architect to win the Pritzker prize,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/15/it-is-unbelievable-francis-kere-becomes-first-black-architect-to-win-the-pritzker-prize
