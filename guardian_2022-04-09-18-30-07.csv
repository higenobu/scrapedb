4/9/2022,"As the BA.2 wave reaches its peak in the UK and begins subsiding in some European countries, US health officials are looking to an uncertain future even as American lawmakers have delayed renewing funds to address the pandemic. While the Omicron subvariant now makes up an estimated 72% of Covid cases, the US has not seen a country-wide increase in cases. Covid hospitalizations are now at the lowest point of the pandemic. But scientists warned this week that the coronavirus will continue evolving to evade immunity, causing future surges that will be difficult to predict. Covid-19 has evolved faster than expected, and “we should expect a lot of evolution going forward,” Trevor Bedford, a professor of biostatistics at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, told a panel of independent FDA advisers on Wednesday. “Those viruses will do better and will spread locally and perhaps regionally and perhaps globally.” The US has generally followed surges in the UK three or four weeks later, but reported cases are holding steady at an average of about 26,000 a day. Although deaths have declined significantly from the Omicron peak, more than 500 Americans are still dying every day. “I think we are going to see some rising cases in some places,” said Benjamin Linas, professor at the Boston University School of Medicine. Lifting precautions will probably result in future upticks, he and others wrote in a study published earlier this month. “We’re not in the crisis that we were back in 2020, but we need to be realistic that we’re also not completely over and done,” Linas said. Some regions in the north-east, including New York and Massachusetts, are beginning to see ticks upward. Philadelphia is considering a return to indoor masking next week. In Washington DC, where confirmed cases have increased by 135% in the past two weeks, several high-level politicians have tested positive, including the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, on Thursday. It’s difficult to parse the extent to which surges elsewhere have been driven by changes in behavior, BA.2’s increased transmissibility, and waning immunity, and whether factors in the US could suppress such a wave. As the pandemic wears on, changes to how cases are reported and counted may also cloud the picture. Home tests are frequently not counted in official tallies, making it increasingly difficult to understand how widespread infections are. Wastewater monitoring could be useful to fill in the gaps, but many places are still ramping up such programs. Several states have moved to weekly or twice-weekly, instead of daily, reporting of cases, mirroring a similar shift in June 2021 during a lull before the Delta surge. Oklahoma is changing how it reports its seven-day average of cases. Changes to definitions of Covid hospitalizations and deaths may also complicate pandemic tracking. Some states have also narrowed their definitions of Covid hospitalization to focus only on patients receiving Covid-specific medications, while others have changed how they define Covid deaths. Last Monday, US lawmakers reached a deal for $10bn in Covid funding, some of which has already lapsed. But on Thursday, several senators confirmed that the vote will not take place until after the upcoming two-week spring break. This amount was lower than the $15bn previously cut from an omnibus spending bill or the $22.5bn requested by the White House. The new bill will not cover tests and treatments for those without insurance, who lost that coverage in March. More than 30 million Americans aren’t insured, and the lack of affordable, accessible testing and treatments could further affect the country’s ability to track and address cases and severe illness. The new funding package would also cut spending for global Covid campaigns, including vaccination, which could prolong the pandemic by allowing new variants to emerge and spread. “This is a global health problem, and if we continue to cut the budget for vaccines in developing countries, we’re going to get the next Omicron,” Linas said. “Because we have these pockets where the virus goes to reproduce, it’s already extended the epidemic by at least a year – and if it keeps on happening, we’re going to chase our tail indefinitely.” An estimated half of Americans may have been infected with Omicron in a 10-week period – a “remarkable number”, Bedford said. In comparison, influenza usually infects perhaps 10-20% of the population in about 20 weeks. But that would also mean that about half of Americans weren’t infected in the first Omicron wave, potentially leaving them vulnerable to another surge now. The coronavirus, as it swept the globe and infected millions, mutated two to 10 times faster than influenza usually does, Bedford said. It’s likely that future variants will still emerge from Omicron, even overcoming immunity from previous cases of Omicron, he added. But there’s also the potential for the wildcard emergence of a new variant from a previous strain, like Delta. Omicron seems to have evolved from a much earlier version of the virus in summer 2020 before exploding across the globe in late 2021. It’s also difficult to understand if Covid-19 will eventually become a seasonal virus, like influenza or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). “It’s not clear to me that it’s actually tied to the months of the year, or if that’s just confounded by the virology that’s been happening,” Linas said. Influenza, for example, is “highly seasonal” but “I don’t think we know that yet about Sars-CoV-2.” One major treatment has been halted in the US amid questions of its efficacy. The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) pulled its authorization of sotrovimab, a monoclonal antibody, as studies reveal it is less likely to be effective against Omicron. Recent research also indicates that this treatment might create resistance – a major concern with other monoclonal antibodies and antivirals. Vaccines and treatments help, but they aren’t sufficient to halt the pandemic on their own, and they must be accompanied by measures like ventilation and masking during times of high transmission, Linas said. Surges are also highly dependent on human behavior. “There is no virus epidemic outside the context of the way people behave,” Linas said. “It would be a big mistake to let off on ourselves and our leaders … The actions we take or don’t take matter a ton.”",News/World news,An uncertain future: evolution of Covid variants concerns US scientists,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/09/covid-evolution-next-variations-mutations-science-fears
4/9/2022,"While in a coma and on life support, Grace Victory had hallucinatory and terrifying dreams. She was sex trafficked. Doctors removed her legs. Her ovaries were operated on, and her children harvested. She woke up dead, in Reading. It was January 2021, and the 31-year-old influencer was in hospital with Covid-19. She remembers the dreams as vividly as if they were the plot of her favourite TV show. They’re “embedded in my brain”, Victory says, “as real memories. Being told it didn’t happen – it’s like, well, it did.” Victory had begun to feel unwell around 17 December 2020. She had a fever and couldn’t hold down any food. Doctors advised her to go in for monitoring, and she flung some slippers and toiletries into an overnight bag. At the time, she was seven months pregnant with her first child. She was admitted to Northwick Park hospital in north-west London with dangerously low oxygen levels, and on Christmas Eve, her son, Cyprus, was delivered by emergency C-section. By Christmas Day, she was in intensive care. The following day, Victory was put in a coma. Twenty-four days later, she went into cardiac arrest, flatlining for four minutes. Doctors restarted her heart, and Victory remained in the gloom of an induced coma. “I was between the worlds, and it was hell,” Victory says. The first time doctors tried to rouse her from the coma, she woke up screaming. She lashed out in confusion and tried to pull out her tubes. “I felt like a lion in the jungle,” she says, “fighting for my cubs. There was this deep rage for everyone, because it was like: where is my fucking child?” Nurses reassured Victory that Cyprus was at home, being cared for by her partner, songwriter Lee Williams. But she still couldn’t meet him in person for the first time since his birth, due to Covid-19 visitor restrictions. It would be nearly three months before Victory would be reunited with her son. In mid-February, Victory finally started to come around properly. For the next three weeks, she lay in her ICU bed, weak, bored and morose. She longed to feel the sun on her face; to look out of a window and see trees swaying in the breeze. To breathe unassisted, without a tracheostomy tube in her throat. Artificial air doesn’t taste real. “It feels like a machine,” says Victory. “When you breathe normal air, it’s warmer and softer.” And then, on 8 March 2021, Victory picked up her phone and tweeted from her ICU bed. “I’m awake,” she wrote to her 104,000 Twitter followers, who had been waiting for news. The tweet was liked 56,000 times, and made national headlines. But Victory’s story of Covid-19 survival and recovery doesn’t end with one viral tweet. It’s ongoing. The trauma is baked into her bones. It has accompanied her on every faltering step – through ICU and rehab, and, finally, returning home to live with her family. Over a year later, Victory is ready to talk about her harrowing near-death experience. It’s a story of two parts: the Grace she once was, and the Grace she has become. “I’ve been a survivor my whole life,” she says. “I’ve been through a lot. Now I’m letting the whole survivor identity go, and it’s like, OK, who am I outside of this? Who is Grace outside of trauma and survival and overcoming? Who am I, without all of that?” Before she contracted Covid-19, Victory – an influencer who posted videos about relationships, body image and mental health to her YouTube channel; partnered with brands including Sky and Pandora on her Instagram account; and wrote two books – was an incorrigible workaholic who, by her own admission, didn’t make enough time for family and friends. “When you’re working class,” she says, “you’re taught to grind, grind, grind, work, work, work, and obviously I live in London, where the cost of living is wild. So I always knew that I was working too much, but I couldn’t get out of that cycle.” We’re speaking at her home in north-west London. Williams is in the room next door, attending to Cyprus, who is a bright and inquisitive toddler. Their living room betrays their status as new parents. Surfaces are stacked with bottles; a playpen in the corner overflows with soft toys; CBeebies plays on the television. I arrive just as Victory is finishing her photoshoot, and the exertion of standing for photographs has drained her. “Can I sit down?” she asks the photographer, before slumping on a stool. Later, she explains that she’s about “90% recovered”, but still struggles with fatigue and limited mobility in her left arm. Victory was born to a white British mother and black father of Caribbean heritage, and grew up in a council flat in High Wycombe. Her father, she writes in her memoir, was a heavy cannabis user and physically abusive towards her mother, although never to Victory or her sister. To escape, Victory enrolled in the Jackie Palmer Stage School in Buckinghamshire, whose alumni include James Corden and Eddie Redmayne. She went on to secure parts on TV, and was an extra in the Harry Potter franchise. “I was modelling at two,” she says, “and then doing TV shows, films, dancing all the time.” Being a working child actor meant she always felt less like a child than the head of the family, particularly when, aged 15, she threw her father – who was separated from her mother, but had a habit of dropping around unannounced – out of the house, tired of his abuse. She is not embittered about this accelerated childhood spent on film and TV sets. “That’s the stuff that saved my life,” she says. “I wouldn’t change it.” Aged 16, Victory was raped, and attempted suicide twice. She subsequently began therapy, and launched a YouTube channel as a creative outlet from a boring admin job. Her first videos were about beauty, but over the years, she would speak about her PTSD, therapy and struggles with eating disorders in confessional videos, becoming a body-positive activist and brand ambassador for Nike’s plus-size range, and a mental health ambassador for Mind, and publishing a memoir and a book about self-care. “I think I grew big because I was a bit different,” she says of her career. “Back then, everyone was white and quite posh, and I wasn’t. I’m quite normal, and I think people can relate to my experiences.” Today, she’s primarily transitioned to Instagram, deleting all of her old YouTube content, and she has 250,000 followers on the platform. When Victory was pregnant with Cyprus in 2020, she knew she wanted his childhood to be different from her own. “A natural childhood … to be safe and content,” she says. And she loved being pregnant: “It was like, oh my God, this is incredible.” Victory was not frightened of the Covid-19 pandemic. “I never paid too much attention to it,” she says. “Obviously I did the usual – wore masks, washed my hands. I didn’t go out much, but I didn’t like going out much anyway. I’m quite antisocial. The chaos in the world was nothing compared with the chaos that I’ve had internally before, with childhood PTSD, depression, anxiety.” Despite the circumstances, Cyprus’s birth was a joyful, calm experience. Williams sang The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face as doctors delivered Cyprus. “It was very peaceful and quick,” says Victory. “So although things turned out to be horrendous, the process of conception and carrying Cyprus and bringing him into the world was actually really beautiful.” She briefly touched her son before he was whisked to neonatal intensive care, but because she had Covid-19, she wasn’t permitted to hold him. The following day, her condition had worsened and Victory was taken to intensive care. She remembers saying goodbye to Williams at the entrance to the unit. “He was crying,” she says. “He never cries. I thought, OK, this is obviously serious.” Victory texted her family and friends, telling them she was certain she was going to die, although she has no memory of sending the messages. Weirdly, there was no fear. Then doctors put her under, and she entered a liminal state, running from the shadowy forces that haunted her dreams. Victory’s body bears the scars of her three-month ICU stay. She shows me a snaking line between her breasts, from the chest compressions. Her tracheotomy scar looks red and sore. But the mental scars take longer to heal, and Victory struggles with survivor’s guilt. “Why did I survive?” she says. “Why have I recovered and pretty much gone back to normal? There was a Covid mummy who died – the clot went to her heart. She was from the UK and she was 30 and she had a baby, and it just rocked me, because her baby’s going to grow up without his momma, and that could have been Cyprus.” She thinks about this often. “The thought of a young black boy living in London without a mum is just really hard for me,” she says. “Because I know that life is tougher when you’re a person of colour.” Being away from Cyprus for the first months of his life “was fucking shit”, says Victory, with a bluntness recognisable to her fans. So was her reunion with her son, on 21 March last year. “People want me to say it was beautiful,” says Victory, “but it wasn’t. I hated it. Because he didn’t feel like mine. I was in hospital, and he was going to have to leave, so it was bittersweet, and I was so ill and weak.” She describes the day after Cyprus’s first visit as the worst day of her life. She lay in bed and finally everything hit her. “I thought, I’m going to die. I’m going to die. I’m dying. I want to die. I was still on a lot of medication, so I was high and sad and out of it at the same time. Kind of numb, but feeling everything as well. Rock bottom.” From April until July, Victory was in what she calls “crisis mode”. “I wasn’t eating. I was really depressed.” She looked in the mirror and didn’t recognise herself. “I was three sizes smaller,” she says. “Pale, my head was bald, my skin was grey.” Victory was transferred to Hillingdon hospital in north-west London for rehabilitation, where she had to learn to sit up, to sit in a chair, to stand up, to walk. Every exhausting, fumbling step forward was for her son, she says. “Cyprus was my biggest motivator. I needed to get out of there.” She was finally discharged in May 2021. At home, she rebuilt her relationship with Williams, who was traumatised by the experience of watching his partner nearly die. “He’s definitely got PTSD,” says Victory. “We both have. And it’s only now coming out for him, because the whole time it was all about me and our son.” (Victory has received a formal diagnosis; Williams has not.) Williams, who is a friendly and affable presence, is not ready to speak about the emotional impact of Victory’s hospitalisation, but in a Father’s Day Instagram post he said that looking after Cyprus while being unsure if his mother would survive was “the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do”. Being absent for the first months of Cyprus’s life has not damaged Victory’s relationship with her son. “We’re attached healthily,” she says. “He’s a mummy’s boy. I put him to bed every night. Being a parent is amazing. I think the experience of being away from him has meant that I’m a more chilled out mum … because it’s beautiful to watch him explore the world, knowing there was a chance that I wouldn’t be here.” Victory is effusive about the medical staff, particularly the nurses who aided her recovery. “They were outstanding,” she says, “above and beyond … There were so many bonding moments with the nurses, and they’ve obviously seen horrific things.” But she plans to use her experience to push for change in how ICU patients are treated, and she’s already met with hospital staff to give feedback. Victory talks about how there weren’t any hair products suitable for her to wash with in the ICU, as a mixed-race woman. Staff woke her up at 3am to check her blood pressure and at 5am for a bed bath, making it impossible to sleep through the night. “There are things that they need to change to benefit the patients,” she says, “and I would be honoured to be able to bring that about and bring awareness as well.” She has also become an advocate for what she calls “Covid coma mummy survivors”, and has set up a closed Facebook group in which women can share their experiences. It’s a space to speak about “memory, fatigue, the guilt around not being there for your child”, says Victory. “Not being able to breastfeed, which was a massive thing for me, that I’m still mourning.” They are, relatively speaking, the lucky ones: at least 33 pregnant women are known to have died of Covid-19 in the UK since the pandemic began. Research indicates that pregnant women are 13 times more likely to die from Covid than people of a similar age who are not pregnant. (This is because pregnancy suppresses the immune system, making it more difficult to fight infection.) Despite these statistics, pregnant women have lagged behind the rest of the population when it comes to uptake of the Covid-19 vaccine, largely due to confused and contradictory messages from healthcare professionals and the government about the benefits of vaccination. Some pregnant women reported being turned away from vaccine centres; others were warned against vaccination by midwives citing the thalidomide scandal. (In reality, data has shown that Covid-19 vaccines are safe in pregnancy). Of the pregnant women hospitalised with Covid-19 since vaccinations became available in 2021, 98% were unjabbed. Victory fell ill before the Covid-19 vaccine was rolled out. I ask whether she’s vaccinated now. “I am going to be,” she says. “I had to get signed off from my medical team, and I got signed off last month.” Given her advocacy for ICU survivors, I ask whether she would also encourage pregnant women to get vaccinated. “I would tell people to do what you need to do to look after yourself, and for you to feel comfortable going forward with your pregnancy,” she says. It’s an equivocal answer, and I ask whether it might not help more people if Victory were to champion the vaccine. “I hear that,” she says. “But when you go through so much trauma … for me personally, I don’t want to be an advocate for things that I don’t know everything about. I’m an advocate for you making your decision with what you want to do.” Later, Victory returns to the topic obliquely. “I sometimes think that people want me to become this spokesperson for Covid and pregnant women,” she says. “But I don’t want to be on that pedestal, I really don’t. It’s too much pressure and you’ll say something and it will be misconstrued or taken out of context or spun a certain way.” I understand her perspective: Victory didn’t ask for any of this. She’s applying the same boundaries in her personal and professional life; working shorter hours, for example, even if it means her earnings go down. “I don’t want to just walk through life with my head in the sand, saying yes to things I don’t really want to do. It’s important to me to live a life that’s for me,” she says. Unexpectedly, Victory tells me that, given the opportunity to go back in time, she wouldn’t change anything. “The growth I’ve had this year in therapy has been the biggest compared with the six years of therapy I’ve had beforehand,” she says. “Tightening my boundaries, my relationships are better, being grateful, working less. All the stuff I’ve wanted to do I’ve only done because of this.” Victory describes her pre-Covid self as someone who was “ungrateful, a workaholic, and separate from everything and myself”. In the room next door, Williams is hushing a babbling Cyprus. Victory looks me in the eyes, but I can feel her awareness drifting to the next room. “Now, I feel brave, and I feel soft, and I feel vulnerable,” she says. “But I haven’t found the words for me yet. And I guess the next few years is me figuring that out.”  In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org.

4/9/2022,"By any measure, Truth Social, Donald Trump’s social media platform, has had a rough start. Engagement is low, the initial flood of downloads of the app have withered to a trickle and the first resignations of its top staff have begun. It’s too soon to tell if it’s a stiff, but as with many Trump businesses that fail to take off, the former US president appears to be washing his hands of it: he has barely used it. The Twitter clone, where posts are called “truths”, was launched with high expectations on February’s President’s Day. It was briefly the most downloaded free app on Apple. But three weeks after Truth Social was launched, its download chart position dropped to 116. Last week it failed to break the top 200. One study found that downloads have fallen by as much as 95%. It now seems Truth Social may be heading the same way as Trump Steaks and Trump Vodka, just to name a few. Slapping the Trump name on a product that others produce better just does not work – especially now. Yet – judging by his public pronouncements – it was meant to be a very different story this time. “I created Truth Social … to stand up to the tyranny of big tech,” Trump said in October, 10 months after he was permanently banned from Twitter. But users, many anticipating a direct channel to Trump and Trumpist thought as the former president prepares for a 2024 presidential run, have been left sorely disappointed by the Truth Social experience. An estimated 1.2 million users who have the Apple-only app have faced long wait times to access the platform. “Thank you for joining!” reads the Truth Social prompt. “Due to massive demand, we have placed you on our waitlist.” Even Trump appears to be steering clear, and has still only posted on the platform once. Meanwhile, Digital Word Acquisition Corp, the special acquisitions vehicle or Spac, bringing Truth Social public is under investigation by the SEC. The deal had been anticipated to reward investors with millions – and Trump himself as much as a billion – but the company has now been rocked an exodus of executives. Last week Josh Adams and Billy Boozer, Truth Social’s chiefs of technology and product development, resigned from the company. The Washington Post reported that the resignations came after the Trump Media & Technology Group CEO, Devin Nunes, the former US congressman, attempted to install his own allies to run the company. Truth Social’s service issues comes as Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, became Twitter’s largest shareholder acquiring a 9.2% stake in the company as well as a seat on the board. Musk, who has had a series of run-ins with US financial regulators over financial disclosures made on social media, has signaled that he plans to advocate for changes on the platform where he has 80.4 million followers. Shares in Twitter rose more than 27%. Last month, he asked his followers if Twitter was failing to adhere to free speech principles. “Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy. Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?” he asked. After more than 2 million users responded, Musk wrote: “Given that Twitter serves as the de facto public town square, failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy.” With speculation mounting that Musk could use his shareholder and board-member power to restore Trump to Twitter, where he had 90 million followers before he was disbarred after the 6 January Capitol riot, the purpose and fate of Truth Social hangs in the balance. Trump Media & Technology Group, the Trump venture that advisers said last year would become a “media powerhouse”, initially presented Truth Social as the centerpiece of its ambitions to counter what the former president routinely call “fake news media” and to establish a social media presence he currently lacks. But, according to the Post, Trump has “privately fumed” about Truth Social’s slow take-up and glitches and considered joining rival competitor Gettr. For several reasons, Truth Social may have been a step too far, said David Carr at SimilarWeb. The analytics firm estimates Truth Social visitors at 200,000 daily, skewed 70% male, compared to 1 million for Gettr. Twitter averages 217 million. “In the case of Truth Social, Gettr and Parler had already emerged to cater to the same audience Truth Social is going after,” said Carr. “So it needed to be 150% better, and so far it hasn’t created great engagement. If Trump had posted a ton of content, and there really was a pent up demand for it, maybe things would have been different.” But the apparent failure of Truth Social presents certain truths about social media itself. Most users don’t come to it, besides perhaps Twitter with its relatively low number of users, for political communication; one-sided conversations rarely inspire engagement, and sites require large numbers of users and traffic to make social impact. “Community management professionals I know often talk about the ‘empty party’ problem of how you get the conversation going from a dead stop, and it’s not an easy problem to solve,” Carr said. At the heart of the issue is what Joshua Tucker, co-director of the NYU Center for Social Media and Politics, terms “network effects”. “Social media sites are more valuable to you the more people are using them. Like a phonebook, it’s of no value if it only has one name in it,” he said. Part of Truth Social’s problem was that it set out to exclude a large part of the political spectrum. “They went after the Maga portion of the population, so they were starting with one hand tied behind their backs,” Tucker said. “It’s a tough sell, even before the problems of the launch and rollout.” Yet Trump has been routinely under-estimated in the past, said Tucker, “yet he somehow seems to lend being a fairly unsuccessful business person to being an incredibly successful political candidate”. Truth Social was created to counter what many conservatives deride as “cancel culture” censorship from the left. But because of its conservative dominance Trump’s social media platform has become medium for “trolls, self-declared and self-made experts, conspiracy theorists, attention-seekers of all stripes”, said Mark Federman, of the University of Guelph-Humber. “Trump’s motivation for Truth Social was to … take control of his voice amplification. That’s failed, so he’s had to admit defeat,” he added.",News/US news,Harsh truth: Trump’s social media app follows long line of failed ventures,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/09/truth-social-trump-app-failed-products

4/9/2022,"The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, has warned that Britons are facing a “historic shock to real incomes”, with energy price rises this year larger than any single year in the 1970s. The disastrous impact this crisis will have on people’s livelihoods is clear: 600,000 could fall into poverty and millions will be unable to afford essentials. But so far the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has only introduced halfhearted half measures. As we face an epochal challenge to living standards and energy supply, there are policies already in place elsewhere that Sunak could learn from: countries such as Germany and Ireland are doing more to protect the most vulnerable, doing more to switch to energy-saving measures and doing more to wean themselves off fossil fuels. This year, the German government has provided a €200 boost for people on benefits, as well as a €100 topping up of child support and at least €270 for people on housing assistance, next to a €300 lump sum payment (pre-tax) to all employees. A low-income family with two children could receive at least €657, plus a possible heating subsidy of €490. With other measures this could fill more than two-thirds of the cash shortfall caused by increased energy prices. By comparison, the average low-earning UK family would receive less than half of that amount (£270, or about €325) plus bills support that will have to be paid back. Elsewhere, France and Italy have moved much more decisively than the UK to limit energy price increases facing households. This has been done through measures including requiring the state energy company to sell electricity at well below market price and tax cuts on electricity. Equally eye-catching are examples of innovative policies to encourage lower energy use. As petrol prices surge, public transport is one of the most effective ways of keeping costs for the economy down. For three months, Germany is offering all citizens the use of regional transport for only €9 a month. Some US cities have also shown that reduced or free public transport fares can increase use. And New Zealand is halving public transport fares for three months in response to high fuel prices. France has been experimenting with free public transport since 2018 and Paris just slashed its ticket prices. This comes on top of European countries’ support schemes for home insulation. Ireland, for example, has just passed a grant policy that provides up to 50% of the costs of a deep retrofit. In contrast, the UK has nowhere near the same ambition. All these international examples contrast with Sunak’s spring statement in which he announced almost no targeted support for lower earners. Analysis by the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank, where I work, shows that low-income households still face an average cash shortfall of £320 this year, with some facing up to a £700 hit. This would leave many of the UK’s poorest in poverty with no option but to miss out on essentials, such as food or home heating. As millions of households are having to cut back on spending, this will also drag down economic growth. Staggeringly, what the chancellor did announce was heavily skewed towards higher earners. We estimate that, on average, high-income households received four times the support of lower-income households. These were Sunak’s policy choices, but it’s not too late to change tack. His first priority should be to establish a livelihood guarantee for low earners. This means ensuring that their living standards do not fall below what they were last year. The government could have achieved this by increasing benefits in line with inflation, to ensure people’s income stays in line with the price of products and services they need. This could be combined with an increase in child benefits and additional measures to alleviate pressure from household bills. With this, the chancellor would virtually fully maintain living standards for low and medium earners at a cost of £9bn – just £1.5bn more than what he spent on his poorly targeted policy package. He could also learn from other countries’ energy saving measures. IPPR has proposed large-scale investment in home insulation, allocated via an easy-to-use “GreenGo” system. This would provide a one-stop shop for people to transition to cleaner transport, housing and consumption, with an initial focus on energy-poor homes, which require support the most. All of this is eminently feasible and affordable. For instance, our proposed package to almost fully protect low and middle earners could largely be paid for by a windfall tax on energy companies – a type of tax that the EU is set to endorse soon. So don’t let the government convince you that its hands are tied, because this is a crisis with global dimensions. In fact, it is precisely by looking overseas that we can see that better policy choices are possible.

4/9/2022,"Jeffery Jones had a parakeet as a kid but never considered himself a bird fanatic. Yet when he and his wife settled into an apartment block in New York’s East Village, the pair began noticing the local pigeons. “We began to see how interesting they were – preening, doing funny little dances.” he says. Around the same time, Jones began volunteering for the Wild Bird Fund, which takes in injured birds in the city. It was far removed from his usual work as a fine art and fashion photographer. “When I joined, they had this resident pigeon, named Ghob after the person who rescued her. She had arrived as a baby: a tiny, yellow, prickly thing, and had refused to leave. We did a trial fostering period with her, but when I took her back to the sanctuary, she was so angry with me she wouldn’t interact with me any more. Then she fell sick and became depressed. My wife and I realised we’d have to adopt her permanently if she was going to survive.” Now, Ghob lives with the couple. She is affectionate, loves head scratches, and will wait by the front door when she hears her owners approaching. Jones took this photo on his phone as he was leaving to run errands one morning, noticing her slightly furrowed brow, a sign of annoyance that he was going out without her. “Adopting her was a personal sacrifice; I took a responsibility on because her life meant something to me. I’m not ‘the pigeon guy’ – I just so happen to have a pigeon.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘I’m not the pigeon guy – I just happen to have a pigeon’: Jeffery Jones’s best phone picture,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/09/i-happen-to-have-a-pigeon-jeffery-jones-best-phone-picture
4/9/2022,"TikTok is on track to overtake the global advertising scale of Twitter and Snapchat combined this year, and to match mighty YouTube within two years, as trendsetting teens and young adults make it the hottest social app of the moment – and Facebook is worried. The Chinese-owned video-sharing platform is forecast to catch up with YouTube by 2024 when both are predicted to take $23.6bn (£18.2bn) in ad revenue, despite TikTok being launched globally 12 years after its Google-owned rival. Helped by unparalleled moments of cool at the height of the pandemic – Idaho labourer Nathan Apodaca skateboarding along to Dreams put Fleetwood Mac’s album Rumours back in the top 10 more than four decades after its release – TikTok’s surging growth belies the metronomic pace of its name. Last year, it overtook the global ad take of Snapchat, previously the digital hangout of choice for teens and twentysomethings, and by the end of this year it will have surpassed that of Twitter. This year it is predicted to triple worldwide ad revenues, to $11.6bn, more than the $10.44bn for Snapchat and Twitter combined. “TikTok’s user base has exploded in the past couple of years, and the amount of time users spend on the app is extraordinary,” says Debra Aho Williamson, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence, which compiled the ad spend forecast. “It has moved well beyond its roots as a lip-syncing and dancing app. It creates trends and fosters deep connections with creators that keep users engaged, video after video.” TikTok landed its billionth user in 2021, four years after global launch, half the time it took Facebook, YouTube or Instagram, and three years faster than WhatsApp. Earlier this week, analysts at data.ai revised a prediction that TikTok would hit 1.5 billion monthly active users this year, after its analysis revealed it had surpassed that milestone by 100 million users within the first three months. The company is winning the battle for the “sweet spot” of social media users, those in the 18- to 25-year-old demographic where Facebook is seeing its biggest declines, with parent company Meta trying to stem the exodus by attracting them to stablemate Instagram. TikTok is also becoming increasingly addictive. Despite the platform supposedly being restricted to those aged 13 and over, about 16% of three- and four-year-olds view TikTok content, according to research commissioned by media regulator Ofcom. This rose to 29% of all children in the five- to seven-year-old age group. Last year the typical TikTok user spent 19.6 hours on average per month on the app, according to data.ai – equalling Facebook, the global leader in time spent by users on social media. For TikTok, this represents an almost fivefold increase in just four years, up from 4.2 hours in 2018. “Facebook has always been the biggest competitor in this space for dominating users,” says Sam O’Brien, the chief marketing officer at performance marketing company Affise. “But it seems it can’t quite tap into convincing TikTok’s loyal users to revert back to its platform. TikTok has figured out its own way to give the platform an addictive quality.” Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta still dominates the market – Facebook has 2.9 billion monthly active users, and Instagram another 2 billion, with Insider Intelligence putting their 2024 ad revenues at $85bn and $82bn respectively. Even so, it emerged last month that fear of TikTok had led it to hire a lobbying firm to paint the company as the “real threat, especially as a foreign-owned app”. “Meta clearly sees itself in a battle against TikTok for the hearts, minds and attention spans of millennials, a significant chunk of the social media market,” says O’Brien. “TikTok has experienced a staggering growth of users since the onset of the global pandemic, taking over a huge chunk of its competitor’s audience.” Meta’s tactics aim to exploit the suspicion promoted under the Trump administration that Chinese companies, from telecoms giant Huawei to TikTok’s parent ByteDance, pose a national security threat as potential conduits of personal data to Beijing. Two years ago, India, one of the world’s biggest markets for social media usage, banned 59 Chinese apps, including TikTok. However, Trump’s plans to force ByteDance to sell its international operations to a US firm, such as Microsoft or Oracle, petered out after he lost the US presidential election. Nevertheless, suspicions remain among many users including those in the UK, which has banned Huawei equipment from being used in mobile phone networks. Last year, research found that almost a third of all Britons were concerned that TikTok might share their personal data with the Chinese government. Among those aged 18 to 34, a third believed it would hand over their data on request from China. ByteDance has also come under pressure at home as Beijing has looked to rein in the power of the country’s tech titans. Billionaire co-founder Zhang Yiming unexpectedly announced in May that he would step down as chief executive, and in November relinquished the role of chairman, as ByteDance underwent a major restructure breaking it into six business units. Nevertheless, the company remains in rude health and last December was named the world’s largest unicorn with a valuation of $353bn – up from $80bn a year earlier – with the markets hopeful of a blockbuster initial public offering in the future. ByteDance saw its total revenues, including its Chinese operation and substantial in-app and ecommerce business, grow by 70% last year to about $58bn, up from $34.3bn in 2020. While Meta remains a much larger business and revenues rose 37% last year, to $118bn, Zuckerberg has felt the need to launch a commercial counterattack to shore up and diversify his advertising-based business model. Always quick to ape the successful innovations of rivals, Meta is exploring launching virtual coins, nicknamed “Zuck bucks” by staff, for users of Facebook and Instagram to buy and use, in a very similar strategy to that already employed highly successfully by TikTok. Earlier this week it emerged that TikTok is now the most lucrative app in the world for in-app purchases. TikTok users spent $840m on its virtual “coins” currency, which can be used to “tip” creators and promote videos, in the first quarter – up 40% year on year. “It’s the biggest quarter for any app or game ever,” says Lexi Sydow, head of insights at data.ai, which published the report. “It’s the first app ever to beat a game in consumer spend in a given quarter.” Zuckerberg’s revenue diversification plans follow an ill-fated launch of direct TikTok copycat Lasso in 2018, which shut after just 18 months. Meta is persevering with rival short-form video product Reels, which launched on Instagram in 2020 and Facebook last year, but despite its efforts TikTok’s momentum shows no signs of slowing down. “Some young people have switched off Facebook entirely,” says Jamie MacEwan, senior media analyst at Enders. “In the UK, 18-to-24s spend as much on TikTok as Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp combined. There is rampant competition for time. TikTok is the one growing fastest right now, and has scale, it’s the one to watch.”",News/Technology,The rise of TikTok: why Facebook is worried about the booming social app,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/09/rise-of-tiktok-why-facebook-is-worried-booming-social-app
4/9/2022,"Charles Leclerc claimed pole position for the Australian Grand Prix with an exceptional lap for Ferrari in Melbourne to beat Red Bull’s Max Verstappen into second place. Verstappen’s teammate Sergio Pérez was in third, with McLaren’s Lando Noris taking an excellent fourth place. Mercedes continued to struggle with Lewis Hamilton in fifth and George Russell in sixth at a circuit where they have claimed pole for the last six consecutive meetings. It was a result they would take, however, having looked off the pace all weekend. Leclerc put in a superlative lap at Albert Park in what is a welcome return to Australia, with the meeting having not been held here for the past two years because of the pandemic. On his first hot runs in Q3 Leclerc, who has looked in fine form all weekend, set the pace with a 1min 18.239sec time but it was only one tenth up on Pérez, who had been very competitive throughout qualifying. Verstappen had also looked strong but for a small lockup that cost him time on what was a formidable lap, one thousandth off Pérez. The session was stopped when Fernando Alonso crashed out at turn 11 after a hydraulic failure on his Alpine. He will start from 10th place. The session resumed after 10 minutes with the track cooling as the shadows lengthened in Melbourne. Pérez pushed on his final hot lap and came so close, within one thousandth of Leclerc’s time, while Verstappen put together a clean lap to edge into the top spot. Yet Leclerc had even more, his final lap was immense, clocking 1:17.868 to leave his rivals reeling, a full three tenths up on Verstappen. Mercedes had sent Hamilton and Russell out early to warm their tyres up and for the first time in the weekend their car managed to look at least able to push, with Hamilton and Russell putting in their best times on their final laps but notably they were still a full second down on the leaders. It is Leclerc’s 11th pole position, his first in Australia and Ferrari’s second this season after they took the top spot in Bahrain and went on to convert it to a one-two finish. For Ferrari it is a moment to savour at a track where they have not taken pole since Kimi Räikkönen last did so in 2007, which was also the last year the Scuderia won the drivers’ championship. It ends a remarkable streak for Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes at Albert Park. Hamilton has taken a record eight poles here including the last six in a row. This year with Mercedes still off the pace, Leclerc’s challenge is from a surging Red Bull and he did superbly to see them off on a circuit where they had looked strong. The pole gives Leclerc every chance to extend his championship advantage in what is developing into a fierce title fight with Red Bull. He currently leads on 45 points, with Sainz in second on 33 and Verstappen third on 25. Sunday’s race promises to be no pushover, however. Overtaking has traditionally been very tricky at Albert Park but there is optimism that changes to the circuit this year should make for a more competitive race. Various corners have been reprofiled while the chicane at what was turns nine and 10 has been removed, allowing a long run along the lake to the challenging fast chicane at the back of the circuit. The track has been resurfaced for the first time since its first race in 1996 with what is hoped to be a grippy, abrasive surface. Daniel Ricciardo was in seventh for McLaren, Esteban Ocon in eighth for Alpine and Carlos Sainz ninth for Ferrari. Pierre Gasly and Yuki Tsunoda were in 11th and 13th for AlphaTauri. Valtteri Bottas and Guanyu Zhou in 12th and 14th for Alfa Romeo, with Mick Schumacher in 15th for Haas. Sebastian Vettel and Lance Stroll both crashed their Aston Martins in final practice but the team managed to repair their cars. Stroll, however, set no time and was in 19th with Sebastian Vettel in 18th. Williams’s Nicholas Latifi crashed out in Q3 after hitting Stroll while attempting to pass him and will start from 19th. The incident is under investigation. His Williams teammate Alex Albon finished 16th, with Kevin Magnussen in 17th for Haas.",Sport/Sport,Leclerc on Australian F1 GP pole with Verstappen second and Hamilton fifth,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/09/leclerc-on-australian-f1-gp-pole-with-verstappen-second-and-hamilton-fifth
