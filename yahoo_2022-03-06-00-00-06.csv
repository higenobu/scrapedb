3/6/2022,"Mark Cuban launched an online prescription medication service earlier this year to help patients save money on drugs. I used the service to order my scripts, and found the process simple and relatively quick. I did not save enough on my medications to justify using the service again, but I still recommend it. Mark Cuban launched his low-cost prescription drug online pharmacy on January 19, 2022. The service claims to help save consumers up to thousands of dollars on life-saving medication.

Source: Cost Plus Drug Company Through a private label agreement, Cost Plus Drug Company contracts with a third party supplier to get unfinished prescription drugs. The service carries out the final stage of processing and labeling and takes a 15% profit margin to reduce the costs of prescription medication — essentially cutting out pharmacy middlemen. Source: Insider I decided to use Cost Plus Drug Company to order my mental health medication and see how much money I could save. The first step to ordering drugs on Cost Plus Drug Company is to set up an account. I spent about 15 minutes creating my account. The process required basic information, as well as details about your medical history. Along with providing my basic information, I had to answer questions about my allergies, health conditions, and medications I'm currently on. I had initially gone to order a prescription for Xanax, but Cost Plus Drug Company does not offer a generic version of that medicine yet. I submitted a request form on the website asking to add Xanax in the future. Luckily, the service did carry my second mental health medication. I found it in a list of medications, organized by category on a drop-down menu. After setting up my account and figuring out which medicine to order from Cost Plus Drug Company, I needed to get my doctor to order in my prescription. The site offered doctors three options to send in scripts: calling a phone number, using an electronic prescription service, or faxing in a request form. I texted my doctor and had her call in the script using a phone number provided to my account. I received an email from Cost Plus Drug Company about 24 hours after my doctor sent in the prescription. I tried emailing the company to ask how long the process would take (as well as to ask for a comment on this story) but could not connect with a representative for an answer. When I went to checkout, I was surprised at how inexpensive the drugs were. I saved $18 on the retail price for my medication, and roughly $5 from the co-pay I usually pay for my medication. Cost Plus Drug Company does not take insurance, but even with insurance my co-pay is typically higher than the cost I paid through Mark Cuban's service. I did pay an extra $5 for shipping, a drawback compared to Amazon's online prescription service that does not charge a delivery fee. But I don't typically get my medications delivered as I prefer to pick them up at a CVS. Source: Insider  I pay about $8 as a co-pay for my medication. Using Cost Plus, I saved $5 on the co-pay since the medicine was so cheap, but I ended up having to spend that money on delivery. I ended up not saving anything after delivery. If I paid without insurance, however, I would have saved $18 on the medication, according to Cost Plus Drug Company's website. I likely won't use Cost Plus again because I am not saving money when I take into account the delivery, but I would highly recommend the service for people whose insurance does not cover their medication, or who pay high co-pays.

Her 2-year-old son Knight James Smith loves trucks, horses, baseball and especially airplanes. Knight’s first time on a real airplane was nothing short of unforgettable. The toddler was able to tour the entire plane and even meet the pilot. Join In The Know by Yahoo's Parenting Facebook group, where you can connect with other new parents, find trending content, product recommendations & more! “My 2-year-old son is obsessed with airplanes, and today this happened,” Smith wrote in the caption. Knight was escorted into the cockpit by a pilot who, like him, was Black too. “Come on up! You want to have a seat?” the pilot told Knight with enthusiasm. “We got a lot going on up here!” The pilot put Knight in the seat next to him, let him hold the steer and even let Knight borrow his aviator hat. Knight looked completely elated. “Representation matters. Thank you, American Airlines,” Smith said. “My son will never forget this.” Shop all of Christian Cowan’s high-fashion looks from his In The Know cover shoot: Only about 2% or 3% of airline pilots in the U.S. are Black, according to Reader’s Digest, with even fewer Black pilots in the military. So it’s actually a pretty big deal that a Black pilot was able to give a cockpit tour to a 2-year-old Black boy who dreams of filling his seat one day. “It was everything! I fly at least once a year, and I’ve never even seen a Black pilot in person. I’ll never forget this,” Smith added. “Love this. Representation does matter. Looking at a future pilot in the works!” one user wrote. “The pilot saw himself in your son, and your son looks at the pilot like he sees himself in the future,” another said. “This made me so happy and teary-eyed,” someone added.

3/6/2022,"A former sheriff’s deputy in Tennessee who was accused of raping a 14-year-old girl over a period of nearly two years will avoid jail time after pleading guilty to a lesser charge. Brian Beck, 47, was sentenced to three years probation after pleading guilty to a charge of aggravated assault, according to Memphis Fox 13. Beck, who had worked on the force with the Shelby County Sheriff’s Office since 2004, was initially charged with two counts of rape by force or coercion and two counts of sexual battery by an authority figure back in 2018. Beck was accused of raping the unnamed teenager over a 20-month span beginning in 2016; he was 43 at the time. According to court documents obtained by Law&Crime, the judge in the case suspended a four-year prison term in favor of probation. The State ordered Beck to have no contact with the victim or her family, be subject to random drug screenings, and serve 150 hours of community service. If Beck violates his probation, he faces the original sentence. Beck also isn’t required to be part of the sex offender registry. Brian Beck Photo: Shelby County Sheriff’s Office “Considering all the facts, evidence, and circumstances, as well as all possible defenses that could be raised in trial, this settlement was made in the best interests of obtaining justice for the victim,” a spokesperson with the Shelby County District Attorney’s Office told Oxygen.com over email. “The defendant will have a felony on his record, and can no longer carry a gun or be in law enforcement.” Beck was relieved from his duties without pay following the grand jury’s indictment in 2018. Beck’s case faced delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a growing backlog of court cases, as previously reported by NBC affiliate Action 5 News. “It’s five years,” the victim’s father told the Memphis outlet. “I mean, she needs closure.” District Attorney Amy Weirich responded to claims that the parties involvedwere not granted their right to a fair and speedy trial, as afforded by the Sixth Amendment of the constitution. “There’s a whole bunch of factors that go into getting any case ready for trial and in a posture of getting that trial off the ground,” Weirich generalized. Still, families and advocates continued to voice their frustration, including the father of Beck’s victim, who wished to remain anonymous. “I mean, there are damages, you know, major damages and unhappiness,” he said. “She just needs some closure. She just needs to see movement of the ball, that’s what she needs to see.” The District Attorney’s Office said the recent plea deal would spare the victim from having to testify during the trial, according to CBS affiliate WREG 3. For the original charges, Beck faced 30 years in prison for each of the two rape charges and 15 years for each sexual battery charge, per Tennessee law, for a total of 90 years behind bars. The legal age of consent in the state is 18 years old.

3/6/2022,"ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — A judge on Thursday sentenced a Florida man to death for fatally shooting an Orlando police officer while he was on the run for killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend. Jurors in November found Markeith Loyd, 46, guilty in the January 2017 death of Lt. Debra Clayton, and unanimously recommended a death sentence during a hearing in December. Circuit Judge Leticia Marques announced her decision during a brief hearing Thursday morning. Loyd is already serving a life sentence for killing Sade Dixon, his former girlfriend, a month before Clayton was killed. Loyd was on the run for killing Dixon when a shopper at a Walmart spotted him Jan. 9, 2017. Prosecutors said the shopper notified Clayton, who was also at the store, and she attempted to stop him. Clayton, 42, was killed during a shootout with Loyd outside the store. “Although nothing can undo the heartache created by the defendant’s heinous actions, we hope that this brings solace to our community, knowing a dangerous murderer will face the highest penalty provided by the law,” Orlando police Chief Orlando Rolón said in a statement. During the trial, prosecutors said the fatal shot was fired as Loyd stood over Clayton in the parking lot. She was shot four times. She was a sergeant at the time of the shooting, but was promoted posthumously. During multiple hearings since the shooting, Loyd claimed he fired at Clayton in self-defense. His attorneys said he was insane at the time after becoming convinced the police were trying to kill him. His mental health has been a key issue since his arrest, with the judge finally ruling last week that he was competent to continue with the sentencing hearing. Clinical psychologist Xavier Amador testified that Loyd suffers from the delusional belief he is a “slave” whom his “slave masters” — the judge and prosecutors — are intent on killing, the Orlando Sentinel reported. Another psychiatrist, Jeffrey Danziger, testified that Loyd can’t effectively work with his defense team. Loyd also claimed he was acting in self-defense when he shot Dixon and her brother, who was injured, a month before Clayton was killed. The defense team also said Loyd suffered brain damage when officers beat and kicked him in the face as he crawled from under a home where he'd been hiding during a massive weeklong manhunt after Clayton was killed. Loyd lost his eye in the beating and the officers were later cleared of any wrongdoing. Another wrinkle in the case came in 2019 when then- Florida Gov. Rick Scott reassigned the case from then-State Attorney Aramis Ayala after she sparked outrage in the law enforcement community by saying she would not seek the death penalty against Loyd. Ayala said at the time that capital punishment had been unevenly applied, was not a deterrent for serious crimes and that she would not seek it in any case — a stance she had not publicly expressed during her campaign for the position. Ayala announced Wednesday that she is running for Florida attorney general as a Democrat. The Loyd case has been winding its way through the court system for years, with Loyd sometimes representing himself and lashing out in the courtroom. “All these families have suffered. Debra Clayton’s family has suffered. Sade Dixon’s family has suffered. All because of the evil actions of Markeith Loyd,” Orange County Sheriff Mina told reporters outside the courthouse. “... And now it’s time for Markeith Loyd to suffer.” Quincy Morris, a cousin of Clayton, told WKMG the outcome is what God “wanted it to be.” “Now she can rest in peace,” Morris added.",U.S./Associated Press,Florida man sentenced to death for killing police officer,https://news.yahoo.com/florida-man-sentenced-death-killing-165133718.html
3/6/2022,"NEW YORK (AP) — Soprano Anna Netrebko withdrew from her future engagements at the Metropolitan Opera rather than repudiate her support for Russian President Vladimir Putin, costing the company one of its top singers and best box-office draws. “It is a great artistic loss for the Met and for opera,” Met General Manager Peter Gelb said in a statement Thursday. “Anna is one of the greatest singers in Met history, but with Putin killing innocent victims in Ukraine, there was no way forward.” Gelb had said Sunday that the Met would not engage artists who support Putin. The Met made repeated efforts in recent days attempting to convince Netrebko to repudiate Putin but failed to persuade her, a person familiar with the developments said, speaking on condition of anonymity because that detail was not announced. The Met’s decision followed the collapse of the international career of Russian conductor Valery Gergiev, who has been close to Putin as artistic and general director of the Mariinsky in St. Petersburg. The invasion of Ukraine has led to a show of solidarity in the arts and culture world with Ukrainians and a backlash against the Russian government and those with ties to it that won't reject Putin's actions. The ripple effects have also reached the international sports world. Netrebko, a 50-year-old from Krasnodar, received the People’s Artist of Russia honor from Putin in 2008. She was photographed in 2014 holding a Novorussian flag after giving a 1 million ruble donation (then $18,500) to the opera hose in Donetsk, a Ukrainian city controlled by pro-Russia separatists. On Tuesday, Netrebko withdrew from all her upcoming performances. Her next listed performance was at Barcelona's Gran Teatre del Liceu on April 3, followed by three concerts with her husband, Azerbaijani tenor Yusif Eyvazov, and an April 13 concert with the Berlin Philharmonic. “I am opposed to this senseless war of aggression and I am calling on Russia to end this war right now, to save all of us. We need peace right now,” she said. ""This is not a time for me to make music and perform. I have therefore decided to take a step back from performing for the time being. It is an extremely difficult decision for me, but I know that my audience will understand and respect this decision.” There was no immediate response from Netrebko to Gelb's announcement. Netrebko made her Met debut on Feb, 14, 2002, in Prokofiev's “War and Peace” and quickly became a house favorite. She has appeared in 192 performances at the house, the last a New Year's Eve gala she starred in on Dec. 31, 2019. Netrebko will be replaced by Ukrainian soprano Liudmyla Monastyrska in Puccini’s “Turandot” for five performances from April 30 to May 14, including a May 7 performance broadcast to theaters worldwide. The Met said Netrebko also will be replaced as Elisabetta in Verdi's “Don Carlo” for five performances from Nov. 3-19. The Met also said it would construct its own sets and costumes for next season's  new production of Wagner's “Lohengrin” rather than share them with Moscow's Bolshoi Opera, as originally planned. Gergiev was fired this week as chief conductor of the Munich Philharmonic, and the Gergiev festival, an annual event since 1996, was canceled by the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra, where he was principal guest conductor from 1995 to 2008. He also was dropped by the Vienna Philharmonic, the Edinburgh Festival in Scotland and Milan’s Teatro alla Scala.",World/Associated Press,Anna Netrebko out of Met Opera over her support of Putin,https://news.yahoo.com/anna-netrebko-met-opera-over-171501608.html
