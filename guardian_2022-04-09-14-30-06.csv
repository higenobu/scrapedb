4/9/2022,"Post-Easter Sunday, supermarket shelves are often filled with discounted hot cross buns. Save them from landfill, or use up a surplus of your own, by making today’s gooey, hot-cross-bun-and-butter pudding, which is a simple twist on the classic British bread-saving dessert. The recipe is eminently adaptable to how many buns (and/or stale bread) you have, and, if necessary, the quantity can be made up with fresh bread, although stale bread holds both its integrity and the custard much better, making it a valued ingredient that’s well worth saving. I’ve sweetened the dish with marmalade, which also adds flavour, but most pantry jam and sweeteners, such as spent lemon marmalade, maple syrup, honey or unrefined sugar, will work in similar quantities. I’ve also added cinnamon, chocolate chips and walnuts, all of which are optional; by all means use any other warm spices (nutmeg or allspice, say), nuts and seeds to create your own waste-saving recipe. This gooey, Easter-themed take on the traditional bread-and-butter pudding makes a grand centrepiece for a celebratory table. Pick a small round or rectangular ovenproof dish in which the buns will fit snugly side by side. And don’t worry if you have only a couple of hot cross buns: make up the difference with regular stale bread, laid out underneath the round halves, or make individual portions in ramekins.

Cut the buns in half horizontally and generously butter the tops. Roughly tear the bases into an ovenproof dish into which all the buns will fit snugly. Scatter over half the walnuts and chocolate chips, then nestle the whole buttered bun lids on top. Pour the custard over the lot, then scatter over the remaining nuts and chocolate chips, if using. Squash down the buns so they soak up the custard, then bake in a preheated 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 oven for 20 minutes, until golden brown.

Simon Wardell Great Expectations, 2pm, BBC Two You can rely on Charles Dickens for a cracking plot – and this 1946 film of his novel delivers that – but it’s in David Lean’s rich evocation of the early 19th century that the adaptation really comes to life. From mist-soaked Kent marshes to Miss Havisham’s dusty, decaying estate and the bustle of London, Pip’s progress from blacksmith’s boy to snobbish young man, courtesy of an anonymous benefactor, is given depth and drama.

4/9/2022,"With recent months bringing record rain, record heat and a sixth mass bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia has experienced a troubling start to the year. While unprecedented rainfall resulted in devastating floods along the east coast, other parts of the country have experienced the driest summer in decades. These events have coincided with a La Niña atmospheric phenomenon, which developed in November and is typically associated with a wetter summer across eastern Australia. But the seemingly ceaseless extreme weather this year has left many Australians homeless, despondent and angry at the federal government’s wilful lack of climate action. Between 23 and 28 February, an atmospheric river – like “a tsunami from the sky” – inundated parts of south-east Queensland with more than one metre of torrential rain. At least nine people were killed, and an estimated 15,000 homes in Brisbane, the state’s capital, were flooded. In just six days, almost 80% of the city’s average annual rainfall had fallen. The system then moved south, laying waste to towns in northern New South Wales. The low-lying city of Lismore faced its worst flooding in modern recorded history, inundating houses and gutting the central business district. Distressing footage surfaced of residents who had become stranded on their rooftops by the rapidly rising waters. Once the flood waters had receded, residents of northern NSW returned to their ravaged homes and volunteers pitched in to remove mountains of waste. A national emergency was only declared a week later, ahead of the prime minister, Scott Morrison, visiting Lismore to survey the damage. The town’s locals, with whom he did not meet, were unimpressed. Farther south on the same day – 9 March – flash flooding in parts of Sydney inundated bridges and roads. The city experienced its wettest start to the year on record, and heavy rains turn its famous harbour brown. Just as clean-up efforts were in full swing, a second extreme weather system developed just weeks later, walloping northern NSW for the second time in a month. At the end of March, Lismore went under again; many residents had nothing more left to lose. Heavy rain flooded the main street in the backpacker town of Byron Bay, stunning locals. “I cannot remember sunshine. It has been raining steadily since spring,” wrote Travis Lipshus. Dr Andrew King, a climate scientist at the University of Melbourne, said it was typically difficult to pinpoint the effect of climate change on extreme rainfall. “Here in Australia we have very high variability from one year to the next, which means it’s hard to pull out a clear climate change signal,” he said. “But for really short duration extreme rain events”– such as the second bout of damaging rain over northern NSW – “we can see a climate change effect”. “The warmer the atmosphere gets, the more moisture it can hold,” said Dr Nina Ridder, a research associate at the University of NSW’s Climate Change Research Centre. “Per degree of warming, it’s 7% more water.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “In observations, we have already seen that extreme rainfall events have become more and more frequent over the past decade … also, the intensity has increased.” Meanwhile, farther north, a different kind of mass devastation was unfolding. Corals on the Great Barrier Reef bleached en masse for the sixth time – and the first instance the event has occurred in a La Niña year. It was, a marine scientist told the Guardian, “a clear sign of the increasing intensity of climate change and ocean warming”. “It’s certainly worrying that we’re seeing bleaching in a La Niña year, but unfortunately I think it’s really a sign of things to come,” King said. “We know that the marine heatwaves we’ve seen in the last few years on the Great Barrier Reef would be virtually impossible to occur without human-caused climate change, at the magnitude we’re seeing.” “Unless we really keep global warming to very, very low levels, we’re going to lose most of our coral reefs globally,” he said. Records have also fallen in parts of Australia where La Niña has had less of an effect. Western Australia had a sweltering summer, with temperatures in the state capital of Perth exceeding 40C nine times. In January, the remote town of Onslow registered a temperature of 50.7C, equalling the highest ever reliably recorded in Australia. In the south, the island state of Tasmania had its driest summer in 40 years, where total rainfall was 43% below the long-term average. “Climate change is increasing the risks of heatwaves, bushfires, and high intensity rainfall,” said Neil Plummer, a consultant at the Monash Climate Change Communication Research Hub. The risk of these extreme events in future, Plummer said, will “depend upon the extent countries, including Australia, reduce their carbon emissions and deforestation practices”. Despite the urgent call to scale up climate action, the Morrison government plans to reduce annual climate spending if returned to power after the next federal election, which is due in May. It has also pushed to soften the wording of an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report to say that the Great Barrier Reef is not yet in crisis. The Coalition government’s actions are particularly jarring in light of the extremes – bushfires, drought and mice plagues – that many Australians have experienced in recent years, to which 2022’s devastation is but the most recent addition. Many now feel, as the incoming NSW Greens politician Sue Higginson puts it: “This is an emergency – a climate emergency.”",News/Australia news,‘This is an emergency’: Australia’s extreme weather crises spark anger at climate inaction,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/09/this-is-an-emergency-australias-extreme-weather-crises-spark-anger-at-climate-inaction
4/9/2022,"Monday I live in fear of Wordle disappearing behind a paywall. It is my rock, my anchor, my beacon of reason and sanity. I need it. And Quordle (four Wordles at once). And – most recently – Octordle (you get, I’m sure, the idea). I start my day off with this tiny piece of chaos resolvable (almost always) into order and only then can I face whatever the news and life plans to throw at me for the next 12-18 waking hours. Today’s a challenge, mind. Louis CK, the comedian who was recently outed as a serial sexual harasser of women, won a Grammy for his rcomedy special that centred on his – uh, “cancellation”. Nadine Dorries announced the government’s plan to privatise the critical and commercial free-to-air success that is Channel 4, which reinvests its profits in the UK, so that – she says - it can compete with streaming giants such as Netflix which carries $18bn of debt, requires subscription payments (at rapidly inflating rates), commissions mostly from America and (to use the technical term) is increasingly shite. Plus there’s, you know – *gestures widely at war, plague and a second series of And Just Like That being greenlit* – everything else. Still! Wordle in four today, Quordle in seven and Octordle in NEVER MIND. On we go. Tuesday News reaches us from Ireland of a 19-year-old woman who had to be rushed to hospital with severe stomach pains after holding in her farts around her boyfriend for two years. Oh, to be young again. I mean – imagine having the time, the energy, to hold in your wind? Imagine being so eager to please, so in love with someone that you still cared enough? Do you remember those fragrant days? Wednesday The greatest thing has happened. A duck has nested in our garden. I am beside myself with joy. Consumed with it. It is the fulfilment of a genuine childhood dream. Growing up in Catford, southeast London, a short walk from the gun shop under Eros House (under whose umbrous overhang took place so much teenage fumbling that – as long as the Greek god’s scope includes Mere Genital Curiosity as well as the higher forms of human longing – could not have been more suitably named), I devoured books about the countryside and all its myriad natural delights. A nest in the garden, the possibility of ducklings tearing about the place – both the child and I and the child in me are almost overwhelmed by the idea. His father, who grew up in the countryside, thinks we’re mad. “It’s a duck,” he says, shaking his head. “It nests. It lays eggs. It’s what birds DO!” The child and I agree that this is a tragically jaded position to be in and enjoin him to shut his yap. We continue to patrol the garden, noting that the mint has gone mad, the camellia Grandma gave us has “taken” and that the hellebores are even better than last year. Spring is here, eggs and dreams are incubating, hope is rising. Unfamiliar feelings everywhere. Thursday I’m supposed to be going out this evening. Out-out, and I realise I have forgotten how. It was never really my thing, as I’m sure you appreciate, but still I used to have a routine that I would follow and which would function as a kind of runway that would ease both the physical journey from inert, unwashed mass on the sofa to presentable form in acceptable clothes going out the door, and the even more painful one from – well, typing monkey to conversationally adept, socially-skilled adult human. But this has all fallen away over the last two years. I roam the house looking for the good hairbrush, the necessary unguents, make-up and above all the depilatory tools that once had natural homes, the ease of access to which helped speed me on my way. Now it’s a stuttering rather than streamlined process, which allows too many pauses for thought and reconsiderations of my position and desires. I get as far as moisturising and then give up. Nature may be healing, but the rest of us take time. Friday I made the mistake of telling my sister about Octordle and she has taken great delight in beating me at it every day since, as comprehensively as she has always done in Scrabble despite me being the supposed wordsmith in the family. It’s just further proof of course that the geeks will surely inherit the Earth, if they haven’t already. My sister works with computers. She has the kind of brain that can talk to them, make them talk back to her and I believe her actual job is to make them talk to each other. She has, in short, actual intelligence – the ability to strategise, prioritise, think in seven dimensions at once, strip a problem down to its component parts and reassemble them as a solution in the time it takes me to alight on the three-syllable word I need to balance a sentence. Such are her abilities (I mean, like, she’s literate as well, you know?) that she can swipe victory from me in any game that has the slightest tactical or any other practical element to it that you care to name. I was a success at school. She is a success at Life. “Wordsmith” my sister WhatsApps me on reading this, somehow managing to snort via text. “Try ‘typing monkey’. That’s all”.

4/9/2022,"It’s a nice morning – nicer than predicted – and when I step into the garden with a coffee, I find the tortoise sunning himself on the bricks. “What’s up?” I say, sitting on the bench. The tortoise fixes me with a reproachful look. It’s really his only look. “It could be worse,” I add. “It’s supposed to be raining.” At this time of year I don’t bring the tortoise in at night unless an unseasonable drop in temperature is forecast, and he doesn’t emerge from his burrow under the ivy until it gets above about 12C, so we don’t see each other that often. Even so, I sometimes feel like he resents my fussing. It’s a lot more stewardship than he’s used to. My wife was given the tortoise as a present when she was eight years old. Originally he was one of a pair, male and female. “Were they, like, a couple?” I ask my wife later that day. “Yes!” she says. “They had an egg!” In the end the egg proved unviable. One tortoise died. My wife’s parents split up. Eventually the remaining tortoise was taken to my father-in-law’s house in Cornwall, from which he promptly escaped. That should have been the end of the story. “How long was he missing for?” I ask my wife. “I don’t know. Two years?” she says. “That doesn’t seem possible,” I say. She shrugs. Two years later – allegedly – a Cornish farmer hit what he thought was a rock while out combine harvesting. The rock turned out to be the tortoise, heading south, a mile from his last known address. He was somehow completely unharmed. “Have you seen the blades on a combine harvester?” I ask my wife. “Bits of this may be apocryphal,” she says. “I can’t remember.” After my father-in-law was alerted to the discovery, it was agreed that the tortoise would be adopted by the farmer. From then on the tortoise lived in a kennel with sheepdogs. According to legend he was very happy there, although this assessment is at odds with a narrative that includes regular escape attempts. The farmer painted a big white stripe on the tortoise’s back every spring, so he could be spotted at a distance before he damaged any more agricultural equipment. That really should have been the end of the story. But many years later the farm was sold, and the tortoise was returned to my wife’s father, who was not thrilled about the reunion. Just a few weeks after getting him back, my father-in-law presented my wife with a large, heavy cardboard box. “It was the day of my mother’s funeral,” my wife says. “I was there,” I say. At that point we’d been married five years, and I’d never heard anything about a tortoise. “I thought he was giving me some kind of memento,” my wife says. “He was,” I say. When the tortoise emerged from hibernation, it seemed wise to let him do what he wanted. What he wanted was to thunk down the back step into the garden and destroy everything. That was 25 years ago. After a couple of winters with us, the tortoise stopped hibernating, preferring a prolonged stretch of reduced activity in winter. We sometimes used him to prop open the kitchen door. But on sunny days he would stomp around, hoovering up grapes and biting the children’s toes. At some point we took him to a vet to make sure we were doing all we could for him, and that he wasn’t as disconsolate as he always looked. The vet examined the tortoise thoroughly and returned a diagnosis: he was a girl. “I’ve never understood this part,” I say to my wife. “What made you think it was the female that died?” “I don’t know,” she says. “I don’t think it’s that easy to sex a tortoise.” When they were little the children called the tortoise Old Man. After the diagnosis we tried Old Woman for a while, but it didn’t stick. He’s just the tortoise. “She,” my wife says. “Yeah,” I say. Out in the garden the low morning sun slips behind a cloud. The tortoise is still eyeing me with reproach. I go back inside and return with some radicchio leaves, dropping them in his path. The tortoise likes radicchio; at least he likes it more than I do. But he continues to stare at me with something like boundless regret. “Anyway,” I say, lifting my cup. “Here’s to another 25 years.” I close my eyes against the returning sun and think: you’ll be lucky.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Tin Dowling: lessons in survival against the odds, from the tortoise",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/09/tim-dowling-lessons-in-survival-against-the-odds-from-the-tortoise
4/9/2022,"The former CBS reporter Lara Logan, who compared Dr Anthony Fauci to the Nazi doctor Josef Mengele, has claimed she was “pushed out” at Fox News because the conservative network does not want “independent thinkers”. “I was definitely pushed out,” Logan told Eric Metaxas, a conservative radio host, this week. “I mean, there is no doubt about that. They don’t want independent thinkers. They don’t want people who follow the facts regardless of the politics.” Fox News has not commented on reports that it “quietly benched” Logan over her remark about Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser. On Friday, a spokesperson for Fox News said the network would not comment. Logan has not appeared as a guest on Fox News since making the comment about Fauci. There have been no new episodes of her show on the Fox Nation streaming service, Lara Logan Has No Agenda, which is still available. Logan made the comment about Mengele, the “Angel of Death” who conducted medical experiments at the Auschwitz concentration camp, in November, during a discussion of the Covid pandemic on Fox News Primetime. Logan said: “Dr Fauci, this is what people say to me, that he doesn’t represent science to them. “He represents Josef Mengele, Dr Josef Mengele, the Nazi doctor who did experiments on Jews during the second world war and in the concentration camps, and I am talking about people all across the world are saying this.” The show’s host, Pete Hegseth, and another guest, the Fox News host Will Cain, did not respond. The Auschwitz Memorial said: “Exploiting the tragedy of people who became victims of criminal pseudo-medical experiments in Auschwitz in a debate about vaccines, pandemic and people who fight for saving human lives is shameful. It is disrespectful to victims and a sad symptom of moral and intellectual decline.” Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, said: “There’s absolutely no comparison between mask mandates, vaccine requirements and other Covid-19 mitigation efforts to what happened to Jews during the Holocaust.” Fauci, whose work has generated threats to his safety and that of his family, told MSNBC Logan’s remark was “unconscionable” and “absolutely preposterous and disgusting … an insult to all of the people who suffered and died under the Nazi regime in the concentration camps”. Fauci also said he found it “striking … how she gets no discipline whatsoever from the Fox network – how they can let her say that with no comment and no disciplinary action?” Logan rose to fame with CBS during the Iraq war and the Arab spring. After leaving CBS in 2013 over errors in a report about the Benghazi attack, she moved into conservative media. In March, Logan told a rightwing online show she was “dumped by Fox” and added: “I was taken off the air at Fox just before they went into a whole marathon of war porn in Ukraine.” She also repeated Russian talking points about “Nazis” in Ukraine and said Fox News had “a few people like Jesse Watters and Tucker Carlson who are doing their best to add some context and to show what this war is really about”. Speaking to Metaxas, Logan also said she did not like being called a “darling of the right wing”.",News/Media,"Lara Logan, who compared Fauci to Mengele, says Fox News pushed her out",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/09/lara-logan-fox-news-mengele-fauci-remark

Jack White – Fear of the DawnOut nowThe first of two new Jack White albums this year – the folky Entering Heaven Alive follows in July – arrives on the back of bonkers single Hi-De-Ho, which features Q-Tip rapping over farting riffs and wailing chants.

4/9/2022,"Travellers are being forced to cancel Easter travel bookings because of a backlog at HM Passport Office which is delaying renewals. Some passengers have been left hundreds of pounds out of pocket because their new passports failed to arrive before their departure date. The Passport Office is currently advising travellers to allow up to 10 weeks for applications to be processed, up from an average turnaround time of three weeks before the pandemic. Meanwhile, service failings with the government’s official courier, TNT, mean some applicants are waiting weeks for delivery after their passport has been issued. Frustrated holidaymakers have complained of a system in meltdown with uncontactable customer services, processing errors and a lack of appointments for the premium-price fast-track service. Linda Hill had to cancel a holiday in France with her newly bereaved father after a replacement for her damaged passport failed to arrive in time. She had paid £142 for the fast-track service which requires applicants to submit their paperwork during a face-to-face appointment and promises delivery within a week. “There were no available appointments anywhere close, so I had to make a six-hour round trip from Sussex to Peterborough,” she said. Both the Passport Office and TNT told Hill that the passport would be delivered on day-eight but it didn’t show up. “The fiasco has cost me £500 because of the lost holiday, but worse was the immense stress caused to my family because the trip was to comfort my father after my mother died last month,” she said. Others claim that their applications were delayed or even terminated because the Passport Office failed to log supporting documents. One mother told the Guardian that she had sent her daughter’s old passport by signed-for delivery in January. Royal Mail tracking showed it had been delivered, but her online account continues to show that the old passport is required. “I have called the helpline over 15 times and submitted numerous webforms with the tracking details showing that we have sent it,” she said. “Weeks have passed with no response and now we’ve been advised that the application will be withdrawn this month and we’ll lose our £80.50 fee if they don’t receive the old passport they’ve had since January.” The Passport Office has reported a surge in applications for passports after the lifting of Covid travel restrictions, with many families planning holidays abroad for the first time in two years. An HMPO spokesperson said: “Due to Covid-19, over 5 million people delayed applying for a British passport throughout 2020 and 2021. In preparation for the demand for international travel returning, since April 2021 our published guidance has made clear people should allow up to 10 weeks to get their passport. “In busier periods, call waiting times will take longer. However, we continue to work with our supplier to further recruit and support the effort to return response times closer to normal levels.” It said that appointments were available to book up to three weeks in advance and that those who experience delays after paying for a fast-track service should apply for a refund. Some applicants have reported waits of up to three months after the document has been issued as TNT struggles to meet demand. The US-owned company, part of FedEx, signed a £77m three-year contract with the Home Office to deliver official travel documents in 2019 and has since been criticised for missed deliveries, poor communications and long delays. It blames a surge in demand post-pandemic for service shortfalls A TNT spokesperson said: “We took a number of actions to restore service levels across our HM Passport Office network – including operational resources, extra team support and additional customer support resources – and we are currently operating within the service level requirements agreed with the Home Office. We apologise to any customer who has experienced a delay with their passport delivery and we will continue to work with HMPO to resolve individual cases.” Most standard travel insurers do not pay out for trips cancelled due to passport issues. However, those who have lost holidays because of delays can take their case to the Financial Services Ombudsman who may require the insurer to pay out if the customer can show they took reasonable steps to secure their passport in time.
