5/6/2022,"A Labor MP who holds Queensland’s most marginal seat is calling for the prime minister to “disavow” her Liberal National party opponent, amid allegations that by not living at the address provided to the AEC he may have committed enrolment fraud. The call, from Anika Wells, came after the Australian reported that LNP candidate Vivian Lobo provided “false evidence” to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) when he claimed to live in the electorate of Lilley. The article alleged that Lobo told the AEC he lived within Lilley, in an Everton Park home, but that the property was, in fact, uninhabited, unfurnished and in a state of disrepair. It reported that Lobo lived in the neighbouring electorate of Brisbane. On Friday morning, a spokesperson said the AEC was “reviewing the circumstances” around Lobo and “may have more to say soon”. In a statement, Lobo said he had intended to live at the address but was delayed in moving. “I enrolled in the electorate as I had signed a lease in Everton Park with the intention to move in straight away,” Lobo said. “However due to my campaign commitments and difficulty with getting tradespeople to the home, I was delayed moving in.” The LNP’s state director was contacted for comment. According to the AEC website, “enrolment fraud occurs if an elector makes a false claim for enrolment, for example using a false name or address. If proven, enrolment fraud can carry a penalty of 12 months’ imprisonment. The AEC announced separately on Friday morning that it had referred another Liberal candidate to the AFP for investigation – a week after the candidate for the Victorian seat of Isaacs, Robbie Beaton, admitted to listing a false address on his nomination form. Beaton said he had worked at the hotel at the address, that his family previously owned, for 20 years and his use of the address was an “honest mistake”. The AEC said it had reviewed Beaton’s candidate nomination and the declarations that had been made in order to run in Isaacs. “There is concern as to whether the information provided by him regarding his residential address on these forms is false,” the AEC said. “The AEC has referred this matter to the AFP for investigation.” Labor has held Lilley since Wayne Swan won it back from the Liberals in 1998, with Wells taking over from the former treasurer at the last election. Wells narrowly survived an 8.12% swing against Labor’s primary vote to hold the seat in Brisbane’s northern suburbs with a 0.6% margin, the fourth-slimmest in the country. Wells told the Guardian his handling of Lobo would be “a test” for Scott Morrison. “This is a question of the PM’s integrity,” she said. “He’s intervened in plenty of other preselections. He needs to intervene here and disavow his candidate, or his own integrity is under serious question.” Asked if Lobo should stand down, Wells said: “The people of Lilley deserve an explanation. I look forward to hearing it.” The pressure on Lobo comes just weeks after he was named candidate, after his predecessor’s decision to pull out of the race in late February, citing mental health. The LNP also lost its preselected candidate for Lilley just months prior to the 2019 election. Jim Liu had stood down and was replaced by a tree lopper, Brad Carswell, who ended up with just 1,229 votes fewer than Wells after preferences. According to the Guardian’s pork-o-meter, which tracks election promises, Lilley has received no funding promises from the Coalition. There were two pledges from Labor, totalling $5.5m. Lobo is an active member of a Catholic church in Lutwyche, in the seat of Brisbane, and is listed on the governing board of The Leaders Institute, a Woolloongabba-based accounting and agribusiness education institute. He appears to have been vigorously campaigning in Lilley and is described as upbeat and outgoing. Outside social media, however, his official campaign presence remain largely devoid of details. As of Friday morning, his biography on the LNP website simply reads: “Vivian Lobo is the Liberal candidate for Lilley. Only a Liberal Government can provide a strong economy and a stronger future.” Meanwhile, the AEC said it had reviewed Beaton’s candidate nomination and the declarations that had been made in order to run in Isaacs. “There is concern as to whether the information provided by him regarding his residential address on these forms is false,” the AEC said. “The AEC has referred this matter to the AFP for investigation.” ",News/Australia news,Queensland Labor MP calls for Morrison to disavow LNP candidate over allegedly ‘false’ address,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/06/queensland-labor-mp-calls-for-morrison-to-disavow-lnp-candidate-over-allegedly-false-address
5/6/2022,"In the greener days of the internet, a proto-meme image bouncing around forums and chat boards depicted a crudely computer-animated Marmaduke sitting at an Italian restaurant, getting yelled at by a bearded man: “SIGNOR MARMADUKE! WHATTA YOU DOIN’ IN LUIGI’S PIZZA PLACE WHEN YOU A DOG AND NO PEOPLE?” This man, presumably Luigi, then notices that something in Marmaduke’s red, pitiless eyes has transformed both his hands into Santa Claus heads, which laugh in Japanese and act as rocket thrusters propelling him into space. My working theory is that the team responsible for Netflix’s new feature-length Marmaduke vehicle had no knowledge of the messy-yet-lovable great Dane’s nearly 60-year comic strip, and instead took as their source material this hallucinatory webcomic most likely thrown together by some lunatic in 20 minutes. In the carelessness of its slapdash construction, the off-putting flatness of its style, its brazen resistance to basic foundations of logic, and its hostility toward conventional humor that borders on the avant-garde, the new film (a term generously applied to this haphazard sequence of moving images) has far more in common with the hectic, ugly delirium of online obscurities than the newspaper’s funny pages. Premiered without fanfare and tucked away in the dustiest crannies of the Big Red N’s content library, it’s now right where it belongs, a digital oddity so minor and off-brand it could barely be said to exist at all. Which would be a real favor to star Pete Davidson, evidently continuing on his Adam Sandler-styled career path by doing the kind of spirit-crushing kiddie flick that gave the Sandman enough self-loathing to fuel Funny People. Lending his nasal Staten Island brogue to our canine pal, the SNL lothario’s every line-read sounds sarcastic, as if he wants in-the-know viewers to understand that he took this job as a scare-quoted bit. Not since Eric Roberts growled his way through A Talking Cat!?! has the sleazy texture of a vocal performance been so violently at odds with the tummy-scratchable critter mouthing the words. And yet this dissonance does mesh in a counterintuitive way with the rest of the film, which shares a certain lack of fluency in even the most rudimentary cinematic vocabulary. And, for that matter, sometimes the vocabulary of the English language. Forget about a consistent tone – before too long, that starts feeling like a lot to ask from a script that bumbles the simple arrangement of plot points in a linear sequence. Action is guided less by causality than by deep, primeval urges for which our civilization has no name, animal-brain impulses thrusting an unusually human animal from one hijink to the next. Marmaduke first galumphs into a birthday party hot on the trail of pork chops and destroys an above-ground pool, loosing a hurricane’s worth of water that drowns the entire neighborhood. In addition to establishing Marmaduke as both a source of tremendous shame for his family – “No one at school wants to be my friend because my dog’s a loser!” cries history’s cruelest child – as well as an overnight viral celebrity, this catches the attention of haughty trainer Guy Hilton (voice of Brian Hull), convinced that turning this disaster on four legs into a dog-show champion will be his career’s crowning glory. His work is cut out for him; in the qualifying round, Marmaduke farts so badly that a significant number of onlookers vomit and die. Luckily, this does not bar him from the finals organized as a doggy Olympiad, with each nation of the world appointing a canine representative. Mexico, for instance, gets a hyperactive chihuahua with a Speedy Gonzalez accent whose obedience is tested by offering him a taco he must refrain from gobbling. The other acts aren’t quite so jauntily racist, though they all find their own way of being just as ill-advised: a French poodle’s come-hither coquette routine invites us to have impure thoughts about a cartoon dog, and an out-of-place martial arts interlude with the Chinese competitor shoehorns in a reminder that Hong Kong-based animation outfit One Cool Group had a hand in this quagmire. The studio first credited with the sex romp Naked Ambition 2 forms an axis of incompetence with co-directors Youngki Lee (a producer of direct-to-video ephemera, taking the director’s chair for the first time), Mark AZ Dippé (credited with 1997’s Spawn and 2017’s equally hellacious Michael Jackson’s Halloween), and Phil Nibbelink (of An American Tail: Fievel Goes West fame). With nearly a century of man-years in the biz between them, they nonetheless top out at a level of aesthetic amateurishness seldom seen in wide-release motion pictures, more closely associated with DVD menu screens, computer games meant to teach children the fundamentals of phonics, or, yes, MS Paint abominations like the unauthorized scene at Luigi’s pizza parlor. The cumulative effect of using technology last considered state-of-the-art in 2003 to bring life to dialogue with the stilted functionality of a first foray into fan fiction is that none of this seems real, or at least not real enough to merit a review such as this one. But that’s the paradox of Netflix, a studio that hasn’t let growth toward industry legitimacy keep them from sluicing bush-league crapola into the water supply: cinema is whatever they say it is, with no distinction made between the half-baked proof-of-concept demos and the genuine articles. It’s all thrown on to the pile with the others, and we move on.

5/6/2022,"Chris only gives the dishes a quick wash, but says my soaking technique is unhygienic Chris, my partner, washes up like a scummy student – he gives everything a quick rinse with a soapy cloth, rather than let the sink fill up and leave the dishes to soak. It’s irritating. I wash up like a normal person: I fill a sink with hot water and washing-up liquid, and scrub the dishes in order of what needs the least attention. Glasses need a quick wipe and then they’re put aside, while the cutlery has a nice little soak at the bottom. You finish with the pans. If at any point the bubbles are not sparkling white, the water is dirty and needs to be refilled. I then move the dishes to the drying rack, without rinsing them off. In my opinion, this is the cleanest, most hygienic way of doing things, because everything has a little bath in the sink. Chris says that because I don’t rinse them, my dishes are covered in suds and dirty water. But there’s no need to rinse if things have been scrubbed properly and left to drip-dry. His way also wastes water as the tap is kept continually running. We got together five years ago, and when we met I’d say “Why don’t you fill the sink, let things soak and wash up properly? It’s not hard.” He still won’t listen. It’s come to a head recently as we’re getting our kitchen redone and we disagree over what kind of sink to go for. Chris wants two sinks so you can have space to rinse dishes separately from the rest of the washing up, whereas I’d like an elegant one-bowl sink to do a big soak. As a child in the Guides, I got a badge for washing up, so I can’t be that bad at it. I was also a kitchen porter; I know how to wash dishes properly. I try to hold my tongue when I see Chris lightly rinse things under a tap and then claim it’s clean. We’ve spent nights Googling our different styles, trying to find others online who wash up like us. I’ll find examples that prove that I’m right, but then so does Chris. I hate watching water run down the drain: it’s just how I was brought up. Rinsing is pointless – the important thing is to scrub the dirt off in the first place. Chris needs to wash up the traditional way. Plates need rinsing; they aren’t clean if they’ve been soaking for ages in a sink full of dirty water I have the tap running while I wash up. I scrub the dishes as I go, then rinse them under the tap to get off all the grease and scum, then they go in the draining rack. Penny likes to take dishes out of the dirty water and put them straight on to the rack, which is incorrect. Taking soapy dishes straight out of the sink to dry means you’re later going to eat from a dish covered in dried soap scum and dirty water. You have to rinse. You’re not going to take a spoon and dip it in dirty sink water and stir your coffee with it, are you? That would be crazy. Penny says my way of washing up is a crime against the environment because I’m being wasteful by letting the tap run. I suppose that’s true, but hygiene is my main concern, whereas waste is hers. I tell Penny: “Plates just aren’t clean if they’ve been soaking in dirty water for ages and not rinsed off.” And also, most of the time you’ve just eaten off them, so they don’t need soaking anyway. She doesn’t listen. But if you’re not bothered about rinsing your plates and dishes off, why wash them at all? Why not just carry on eating from them again and again? Penny’s method takes longer and doesn’t achieve as good a result. I usually do a bit more of the washing up, but when it’s Penny’s turn I watch her take dishes out of the murky water and place them straight on the rack. Occasionally I’ll say, sarcastically: “I can’t wait to eat breakfast off that grimy plate tomorrow.” Usually I don’t say anything, though. I value my life too much. I’ve also been a kitchen porter in a curry house – and rinsing was everything there. I’ve no problem with soaking things in hot water, but it’s what you do afterwards that worries me. Penny needs to rinse them off and finish the cleaning properly. We’ve reached an impasse about the sink in our new kitchen. Our current sink has a large main bowl and a small side sink for rinsing. I think we should get another two-bowl sink so we have somewhere to rinse the dishes. Whichever one we choose, though, I won’t be filling it with dirty, soapy water. Should Chris wash up Penny’s way? I’m with Chris on this – except there’s no need to leave the water running while you’re washing crockery and cutlery. And pans may require a soak. But afterwards, everything should be rinsed for a hygienic result.Thomas, 31 Both Chris and Penny are convinced their method is The Right Way. They both need to take a deep breath and accept that whoever’s washing-up gets to do it their way. For the future, a double sink would be extremely useful, regardless of whose method they use!Carolyn, 51 Chris is innocent. Soaking and (proper) scrubbing both result in clean plates, but the soap bubbles and sink water are dirty, so they need rinsing off. Also, if you have to refill the sink, you’re not probably saving much more water. You may want to consider a dishwasher for your new kitchen.Leri, 35 Chris is right. Dishes should always be rinsed with clean water as a final step. Soaking is not necessary as long as dishes are washed promptly to avoid bacteria buildup from stuck-on food.Athena, 28 Chris is innocent – rinsing is essential, although Penny’s soaking method has some ecological merit. Why not combine the methods by soaking dishes first, then rinsing them quickly under running water? But after arguing about this for years, and with a new kitchen planned, why not invest in a dishwasher, to save time, water and, crucially, emotional energy?Anna, 46 So now you can be the judge. In our online poll below, tell us: should Chris adopt Penny’s way of washing up, or is his method better? We’ll share the results on next week’s You be the judge.

5/6/2022,"England’s chess children claimed a record 14-medal haul last weekend when the island of Rhodes hosted the European Schools age group championships followed by the Fide World Rapid and World Blitz youth championships. Seven golds, one silver and six bronzes put England second in the overall medal table, one gold behind Turkey but one ahead of Ukraine. The result owes something to Netflix’s Beth Harmon in The Queen’s Gambit, to the inspiration of Magnus Carlsen as an active and personable world champion, but also to the pandemic when schools were closed and chess websites offered unlimited free play at fast time rates. Young talents could hone their skills over several months with thousands of speed games. Two seven year olds featured in this column recently were both multiple winners. Kushal Jakhria won two golds and a bronze, while Bodhana Sivanandan scored a triple gold and won all 24 games she played. The English Chess Federation arranged for Jakhria and Sivanandan to receive daily coaching via Skype at Rhodes from the former British champion GM Jonathan Hawkins whose online junior club at Lichess has over 700 members. England’s girl players won five of the seven golds, as the ECF’s campaign to attract more female participants gathers momentum. One useful contact is She Plays to Win, which offers free online coaching and support for girls from beginner level upwards. The ECF would like a sponsor for women’s chess to stimulate further progress. Alireza Firouzja, the brilliant 18-year-old who jumped to world No 2 last autumn, is back in action this week after a mysterious five-month absence from competitive play. The former Iranian, who now represents France, is one of four GMs using the just started Superbet Classic in Bucharest as a warmup for next month’s Candidates in Madrid. Round one at Bucharest included the pairing Fabiano Caruana v Firouzja, the two prime favourites for the Candidates. No fireworks, just a cautious 29-move draw by repetition. Manx Liberty, the Isle of Man team sponsored by Chess.com, took a narrow lead over their main rivals Wood Green in the penultimate weekend of the 4NCL national league .It occurred strangely, as Wood Green had been ahead after six rounds (of 11) with only weaker opponents still to play. Then the Londoners lost to their own second team, Wood Green Youth, handing the advantage to Manx. Wood Green Youth’s decisive points were scored by women, as the England No 1 and online commentator Jovanka Houska outplayed England’s rising GM Ravi Haria in the endgame, while Katarzyna Toma defeated GM Neil McDonald by a dynamic attack. The final 4NCL weekend is on 25-26 June. The England No 2, GM Gawain Jones, played for Munich in the German Bundesliga last Saturday, where he won based on the rare concept of turning a stodgy Scotch Game into an attacking weapon by queen’s side castling. Jones flew back home for the Monday 4NCL match where Yorkshire’s Chessable White Rose took on the league leaders Manx, but was outgunned as the Latvian legend Alexei Shirov turned on his creative skills in an entertaining game which is well worth a look. 3814: 1 Qxb6 Nxb6 2 Rxe7+!

5/6/2022,"After the initial shock, the blame. On Monday, when news broke of the leaked US supreme court draft opinion overturning Roe v Wade, millions of horrified Americans sought emotional release. “I am angry,” said Elizabeth Warren, voice shaking, leading a pack of reporters straight over a flowerbed outside the supreme court. Her face ignited with rage as she reminded them that 69% of Americans are against overturning the abortion legislation. “The Republicans have been working towards this day for decades,” she said. In the background, a man shouted, “You want to dismember children in the womb!” For many of us, that man – the you-want-to-kill-babies guy – and his ilk were not the first target for righteous abuse. It’s hard, in moments of duress, to get much satisfaction from reiterating an existing and long-held revulsion, particularly when its subject is beyond reasonable reach. When considering the rightwing architects of this moment, there was no “what if” in attendance; all the what ifs belonged to the left. Political purists who in 2016 urged Democrats to avoid voting for Hillary Clinton (hi, Susan Sarandon) were the first in line, and social media echoed to the sound of, “We told you this would happen.” Sacrificing the good in pursuit of the better and winding up with the absolute worst – a dynamic as familiar to British as to American leftwing politics – was, in this moment of horror, a more enraging consideration than flat hatred of the right. From revived outrage at the Bernie bros, it was a quick descent into rage against various champions of the left. “You know who I blame for this?” said a friend. “Ruth Bader Ginsburg.” The late supreme court justice’s vanity in hanging on to her seat, her overconfidence that Clinton would win, her refusal to listen to warnings from the Obama White House that, should the unthinkable happen and the Republicans regain the presidency, the first casualty would be Roe v Wade – her fundamental enjoyment, one assumed, of being RBG when she could have ceded her seat to an Obama appointee – twisted us up into pretzels. I love Ginsburg, so all this had about it the extra and extremely female zing of self-harm. Oh, and Clinton wasn’t off the hook either. “If she’d bothered to campaign in Michigan,” said another friend sourly, “none of this would’ve happened.” All the terrible, bad-tempered fights of that election flew back up into the air, like a water column after a bomb. The only Republican who came in for similar ire was that idiot Susan Collins, senator from Maine, a supporter of abortion rights who had nonetheless voted in line with her party to confirm both Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to the supreme court. Both had assured her, she said at the time, that they wouldn’t go after Roe v Wade. Shocked! Shocked, she was, this week to discover these were not men of their word. Of course, all this fury was mere displacement for the fundamental truth that rightwing forces were smarter, more organised, disciplined and talented in prosecuting a digestible narrative – “don’t kill babies” – than the fractured and dissembling left. Progressives tried to rally towards concrete solutions. There were things to be done – in the first instance, register to vote. (After less than a year of citizenship, I hadn’t. This weekend, I will). There was the call for fundraising. Celebrities started throwing around $10,000 matching donations to anyone giving to local abortion funds. And both Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders, as well as senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Chuck Schumer, hyped the necessity of codifying Roe v Wade in Congress, a move backed by President Biden that would enshrine the right to abortion in federal law irrespective of actions taken by the supreme court. It sounds good, and has the advantage of generating political action. But it is also a long shot, a case of last-resort measures, and too little too late. Earlier this year, Democrats tried to codify Roe, and while it passed the House it failed in the Senate, overcome by a filibuster. (Then “we must end the filibuster”, tweeted Sanders. None of this can happen quickly, if at all.) The fact is that if, as Warren said, the Republicans had been planning this moment for decades, rigging composition of the supreme court with precisely this endgame in mind, there was, irrespective of the scale of public outrage, no immediate way to turn back. In this first week of shock, before anger might become effectively organised, there was only the tiny compensation of the blame spiral.

5/6/2022,"As a New York grand jury investigating Donald Trump appears poised to expire, questions have emerged about what could now happen to the high-profile criminal inquiry into the former US president. The six-month special grand jury, which started under former Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance Jr in late 2021, and continued under the current DA, Alvin Bragg, reportedly investigated discrepancies in the Trump family’s valuation of real estate. Recent developments overwhelmingly suggest that the investigation will conclude without any criminal charges against Trump. The two top prosecutors helming this inquiry, Mark Pomerantz and Carey Dunne, abruptly quit in February, indicating discord between investigators and Bragg. The New York Times published Pomerantz’s resignation letter in March, in which he wrote that Vance had “directed the team to present evidence to a grand jury and to seek an indictment of Mr Trump and other defendants as soon as reasonably possible”. But Bragg, who took office in January, reportedly assessed their case and disagreed. Despite these reports, Bragg has insisted that the investigation continues. “As anyone who has worked on criminal cases in New York knows, New York county has grand juries sitting all the time,” Bragg said in a prior statement. “There is no magic at all to any previously reported dates.” But several veteran attorneys said they do not think the investigation will result in any charges despite these pronouncements. Some said that they weren’t all that surprised, given the turbulent developments of late around the investigation. “Nothing was going to happen, because why else would the prosecutors who were running the case leave?” Neama Rahmani, president of West Coast Trial Lawyers, told the Guardian. “I think the resignations speak volumes.” Rahami said that the nature of grand juries often actually favors the prosecution. Only a majority of grand jurors need to vote in favor of an indictment, not the whole panel. More, the standard for returning an indictment is not all that high, just “legally sufficient evidence of a crime and whether there is reasonable cause to believe that the accused person committed that crime”. So, if prosecutors want an indictment, they can almost always get one. “When you present evidence for the grand jury, it’s a completely one-sided affair,” Rahami said. “If you want to get the indictment and you want to win, you’ll get it.” Rebecca Roiphe, a former prosecutor in the Manhattan district attorney’s office who is now a professor at New York Law School, said that the resignations of Pomerantz and Dunne revealed “some kind of disagreement about the strength of the case”. The seasoned prosecutors might have believed that they had enough for an indictment, and Bragg might have disagreed. “Prosecutors look at evidence and sometimes come to different conclusions about the strength of the case, the wisdom of going forward, and how to exercise their discretion,” Roiphe said. “So it looks like that’s what happened.” Bragg’s prior insistence that the investigation continues also raises questions. “It seemed unlikely to me that he really thought, at that point, that he was going to find something new. “It’s not the kind of case where you’re flipping witnesses, so what would he have expected to find that Pomerantz and Carey Dunne hadn’t already found? It just seems like there wasn’t anything,” Roiphe said. “I think it’s dead. There has been no activity that I’ve heard of, from the grand jury, in quite a long time,” a source familiar with the case told the Guardian. The source said that one witness who had testified before the grand jury had not been contacted by the district attorney in months. The New York Times previously reported that a minimum of three key witnesses either hadn’t heard from prosecutors, or asked to testify. The source said prosecutors might have made a strategic error in how they pursued charges against the Trump Organization’s former financial chief, Allen Weisselberg. “I think that the problem with the case is that it was brought for the purpose of trying to convince Weisselberg to become a witness against Donald Trump or one of his children. That was a gamble, and it didn’t work,” the source said. “Now, they’re stuck with going to trial in this case, which takes a lot of time, a lot of effort.” Michael Cohen, Trump’s former fixer, appeared to corroborate that prosecutors had not contacted some key potential witnesses. “I have never met with or spoken with DA Alvin Bragg which surprised me, as I had met with and spoken with former DA Cyrus Vance a dozen times,” Cohen told the Guardian. Daniel R Alonso, a former chief assistant district attorney in Manhattan who’s now a partner at Buckley LLP’s New York office, says that despite Bragg’s insistence that the investigation continues, it does not appear that an indictment will emerge. “The DA says the investigation is continuing. He’s been very clear about that, so I have no basis on which to say he’s not telling the truth,” Alonso said. “That said, it strikes me as an unlikely prospect that they will be filing an indictment against Trump for the facts that everyone has been reading about over the last few months.” While the New York City criminal investigation into Trump appears to be on the decline, the state attorney general’s civil inquiry remains ongoing; that investigation also focuses on real estate valuations. Trump’s attorney did not respond to a request for comment.",News/US news,The grand jury investigating Trump appears set to expire – what’s next?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/06/donald-trump-new-york-grand-jury
5/6/2022,"Poor John Constable. What did he ever do except go out in the fields and paint? For that apparently harmless pursuit, it seems Tate Liverpool cannot forgive him. Its attempt to define a “radical” British landscape art keeps kicking Constable as a convenient shorthand for the “conservative” landscape tradition it rejects. His painting Flatford Mill (Scene on a Navigable River) is shown near a looped clip from John Berger’s Ways of Seeing. If you can shut out this insulting reduction of Berger to an intrusive soundbite, you have to contend with a lengthy wall text that tells us Constable’s “idealised image of nature and rural life” creates an idyll “in contrast to the reality for workers of the time”. Like a rambler from the city with no feel for the countryside, this exhibition strays into the brambles and thickets of intellectual confusion. For Constable’s painting, if you give it the chance the curators don’t, is a detailed view of a canalised stretch of river where a barge is getting a tow from a horse on the bank. The horse is ridden by a boy who turns to make sure the tow rope is secure. Or is he enviously eyeing another lad who is having a happy day fishing? For this is a portrayal of child labour. Far from ignoring the miseries of his age, Constable honestly depicts them. Round the corner is Tacita Dean’s 2006 work Majesty, a tremendous black-and-white photograph of a gnarled old English tree isolated from its surroundings by layers of pale gouache. Other trees are visible as misty spectres through the whiteness but Dean has brushed over them to focus on this mighty old warrior with its winter branches like witch’s fingers. It is a modern masterpiece but what makes this “radical” and Constable “conservative”? There is just as much love of timeless, pastoral and, yes, unmistakably British nature in Dean’s woody reverie as in his depiction of barge life. The exhibition could have been so much better, if it only accepted what Dean’s tree is silently saying – that love of landscape not only has radical and conservative sides but they coexist in the same work of art, the same experience of nature. By defining Constable’s and (if it followed its own logic) Dean’s love of the British countryside as something retrograde, oppressive and literally Tory, it makes nonsense of its own thesis that the land belongs to us all, as well as its warnings of the urgency of climate crisis. If loving green fields is wicked, why go there? If nature is exclusive, why save it? The climate section is the most catastrophic. It feels as if the curators have selected works with a dull sense of routine to fill in blanks. Gustav Metzger’s Liquid Crystal Environment is a document of 1960s counterculture, which influenced psychedelic lightshows – but what has it got to do with landscape or climate? At least his other work here, a photo of massive roadworks framed within a rusty caterpillar track, does have a – slightly obvious – point. But why do so many contemporary climate artworks use state-of-the-art tech that actually embodies the energy guzzling consumer civilisation that’s the problem? Yuri Pattison uses a mind-boggling array of devices including an atomic clock to entirely shrug-inducing effect. I suppose you could also accuse Jeremy Deller’s neon version of the Cerne Abbas giant of guzzling energy – but it’s a hilarious and liberating visionary delight. Deller has reproduced the famous chalk figure of a man with a huge willy waving a club in white neon against a green background. It’s more visually subtle than it sounds: the light brings the greenness to life and you get a real blast of the British landscape at its most romantic and mysterious. For a moment, the show starts to rock. Deller’s obscene avatar of a primitive English past is surrounded by subversive encounters of ancient and modern. There’s a spooky film of Avebury stone circle by Derek Jarman, his camera homing in on the enigmatic stones like messengers in the dawn. Alan Lodge shows slides and videos of free festivals in the late 80s including at Stonehenge; the soundtrack had me wanting to shuffle along with these happy idiot savants in a field. And that’s what this entire show could have been like: joyous, life-enhancing and therefore truly radical. It could have juxtaposed William Blake’s depictions of the ancient bardic British land with Deller and brought in masses of weird old folk art to show us the hidden popular story of the land. But no. Even when acid house is pumping out, this exhibition can barely let its hair down before exploring some other reason to be cheerless.

5/6/2022,"Wandsworth, Westminster, West Oxfordshire – it is hard to think of more quintessentially Tory places than Margaret Thatcher’s favourite council; the borough that is home to swanky Mayfair, or David Cameron’s back yard. Yet as the Conservatives wake up on Friday morning, they have lost all three – Wandsworth and Westminster to Labour, and West Oxfordshire to no overall control, as the Liberal Democrats march onwards in the blue wall. Scotland and Wales are yet to start declaring results, but Friday already looks like being a very bad day for Boris Johnson. Already, the Liberal Democrats feel vindicated in their argument that decent, longtime Conservative voters are disgusted at Johnson’s record, and turning to them – not just in West Oxfordshire but in Merton in south-west London, too. When senior Conservatives repeatedly insisted in recent weeks that they could lose the longtime Tory boroughs of Wandsworth and Westminster to Labour, it was widely dismissed as expectations management. But as Thursday approached, more and more MPs from both parties who ventured out canvassing reported that things were looking bad for the Conservatives. One senior CCHQ figure, asked for the mood ahead of Thursday, said “braced”. It seems they were right to be. As the hundreds of new councillors settle down to the hard graft of ensuring vital local services are delivered, the postmortem has already begun for a Tory party reeling from Partygate and the rocketing cost of living. Ravi Govindia, the Conservative leader of Wandsworth council, made clear where he believes the blame lies, saying, “consistently on the doorstep the issue of Boris Johnson was raised”. While they were ready for losses in London and southern England, the Tories had hoped to show they are holding their ground – or even advancing – in areas where they took seats from Labour in the 2019 general election. There is scant evidence of that so far. Labour number-crunchers analysing the vote share in key battlegrounds that have already declared claimed said these suggested they could be in line to take back Westminster seats including Hartlepool, Sunderland, West Bromwich and Workington. The Conservatives had hoped to take Sunderland council; in the event they lost one seat, leaving the balance of power all but unchanged, with Labour comfortably in control. They retained control of Dudley comfortably – but lost two seats to Labour. Of course, the read-across from local to national polls is far from precise, and many results are still to come, not least in Scotland and Wales; but if Conservative MPs saw Thursday as a test of whether Johnson remains an electoral asset, he appears to have failed. One former cabinet minister warned last week that a poor set of results could act as the “tinder” for a potential move against the beleaguered prime minister. Judging by these early results, the mood in Westminster as MPs return next week may well be highly flammable.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson looks to be in trouble with these local election results,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/06/local-election-results-boris-johnson-tories-wandsworth-westminster
5/6/2022,"Truck drivers in Queensland are preparing to take industrial action by wearing bright pink and only responding to bosses with “Nanu Nanu” after their company, Anthony Pratt’s Visy, refused to offer a real pay increase. On Thursday, workers at Visy’s glass recycling facility in Queensland rejected the company’s offer of a 2% pay rise after demanding a 3% rise to keep up with growing inflation. It comes after the Reserve Bank of Australia warned this week that real wages could shrink as much as 3% in 2022 as inflation goes through the roof. Jared Abbott, the director of organising for the Transport Workers Union Queensland, said drivers and warehouse staff had voted for a fun action that shows they also mean business. Although a traditional 24-hour strike is still on the cards, workers will start by wearing hi-vis pink clothing and only respond with “Nanu Nanu” to communicate with their bosses. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Nanu Nanu” is a reference from the 70s television show Mork and Mindy. In the show, Robin Williams plays the alien Mork, who would greet people with “Nanu Nanu” instead of hello. At the height of the show, the phrase was turned into a popular saying. The response will be used for all in-person and over radio communication. “It’s really just a fun way for us to have a strike,” Abbott said. “I’m not entirely sure what was the catalyst [for choosing “Nanu Nanu”], but the group thought it was a good idea, and that’s the way democracies work.” While the union is taking a more creative approach to the action, he said they meant business. “They want the company to know they are serious and we’re willing to give them an opportunity to do the right thing. Otherwise, we’ll have to escalate.” The union has already rejected the 1.5% rise offered and made the application to the Fair Work Commission to take industrial action this week. Abbott said the company had made a profit during the pandemic, so it was only fair workers got a real wage rise. “They’ve failed to put forward any reasonable increase for these guys.” “They’re offering 2% while the inflation rate is at 5% and in Brisbane, it’s 6%.

5/6/2022,"A mystery box jellyfish spotted in Sydney waters may belong to a new species entirely, an expert working to identify the marine animal has said. The sightings of the jellyfish outside of tropical waters have prompted warnings about correct first aid for marine stings. Two encounters with the jellyfish were caught on camera by Scott Belcher, a Sydney resident, who first spotted it a fortnight ago during a group ocean swim near Cronulla’s Shark Island. “We swam a little further down south to Shelly beach and ran into what I thought was a rather large jimble,” he said, “but filming it [we] realised that it’s a lot meaner.” The jimble, Carybdea rastoni, is a species of box jellyfish with only four tentacles which can deliver a painful but not dangerous sting. The new species had several tentacles around 30cm long and more closely resembled the deadly Australian box jelly, Chironex fleckeri, also known as the sea wasp. “The head of the jellyfish was about as big as your palm,” Belcher said. He filmed another encounter six days later of what is believed to be a second jellyfish of the same species. “It’s just unbelievable that I was in the right spot at the right time with my camera working.” Dr Lisa-ann Gershwin, a jellyfish expert in Hobart, said it was possible the Cronulla specimens belonged to a new species. “It is not Chironex fleckeri, the one we lovingly refer to as the box jellyfish,” Gershwin said. “But it is a box-shaped jellyfish which is closely related to Chironex. My very first reaction was … that does not belong in Sydney.” She is working with the Australian Museum to characterise the species, which she said resembled an unidentified specimen held in the museum’s collection since 1984. Another possibility was that the Cronulla sightings were larger specimens of Chiropsella saxoni, a 3cm pygmy box jellyfish, which was discovered in Queensland and which Gershwin identified as a new species in 2015. Gershwin said it was difficult to determine whether the new jellyfish was toxic because it had a mix of features of both non-dangerous jellyfish and also the Australian box jelly – the world’s most venomous marine animal. “In my experience studying the box-shaped jellies of the world … all of the ones with thick tentacles are dangerous, and all of the ones that are not dangerous tend to have thin tentacles,” she said. “The problem is the Cronulla ones have thick tentacles.” But other structural features of the new jellyfish resemble those of non-dangerous species, including the presence of round gastric saccules – “little gelatinous knobs on the inside of the body”. Gershwin said there had been scattered sightings of deadly Australian box jellies in New South Wales over the past few decades, but no footage or recovered specimens. “Any jellyfish that someone gets stung by outside the tropics is automatically assumed to be a bluebottle,” she said. “Most people don’t realise that there is an Irukandji [the species Morbakka fenneri, which Gershwin characterised in 2008] that is native to NSW, that has been stinging people … since 1905.” For jellyfish stings outside tropical areas, the Australian Resuscitation Council recommends rinsing the sting well with seawater and then using hot water or ice for the pain. It is “standard and appropriate treatment”, Gershwin said, emphasising the importance of washing the sting with seawater first. She advised against immediately using hot water on suspected box jellyfish stings. “Freshwater forces stinging cells to discharge, so it increases the venom load, and heat dilates the capillaries, basically opening the floodgates for the venom to circulate around.” A handy rule of thumb for jellyfish stings, Gershwin said, was that bluebottles were usually found in armadas. “If you get a sting, you come out of the water and there are no bluebottles up and down the beach, then the right assumption would not be that it’s a bluebottle.”",News/Australia news,"Mystery box jellyfish spotted in Sydney waters may be an entirely new species, expert says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/06/mystery-box-jellyfish-spotted-in-sydney-waters-may-be-an-entirely-new-species-expert-says
5/6/2022,"Bob Stanley’s first book, 2013’s Yeah Yeah Yeah, looked like a completely insane undertaking: the entire history of pop music – from the first British chart in 1952 to the rise of Beyoncé’s Crazy in Love – in one book. Astonishingly, it worked. It was wide-ranging and learned, opinionated and funny, and justly critically acclaimed. Clearly that success emboldened its author: the prequel, Let’s Do It: The Birth of Pop, feels even more ambitious. It attempts to tell the story of pop from the turn of the 20th century, when the term was first used – a 1901 advert in the Stage for a sheet music lending library promised “all the latest Pop. Music” – to the rise of rock’n’roll. It feels vastly broader in scope, by necessity encompassing everything from music hall to Muddy Waters. Because Stanley continues the stories of pre-rock’n’roll stars long after the rise of rock’n’roll – one later chapter is titled Adventures in Beatleland – a book that begins in Victorian London ends, more or less, in the present day: a huge timespan to cover, even in 600 pages. As with its predecessor, it shouldn’t work, but it does. Yeah Yeah Yeah seemed like the product of a lifetime spent devouring and considering pop, but Let’s Do It is clearly more of a voyage of discovery for its author. An inveterate record collector, Stanley’s writing crackles with the exhilaration of a man who’s encountered a whole new world of vinyl to obsess about. It adds a fresh excitement to some well-worn stories: Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Frank Sinatra. Never happier than when rescuing a figure from obscurity – whether it’s Jeri Southern, a contemporary of Peggy Lee whose career was undone by stage fright, or Sam Mayo, who billed himself as “The Immobile One” and seems to have been Edwardian England’s equivalent of Morrissey, lugubriously intoning songs called I Feel Very Bad I Do and Things Are Worse in Russia – Stanley can also muster enthusiasm even when he doesn’t particularly like what he hears. He hasn’t got much time for Al Jolson, a “bellowing ham” in blackface, but he can work out what people must have seen in him. He rattles through anecdotes and potted biographies at a clip that recalls someone hastily ripping one recent purchase off the turntable in order to play you another. He has both a snappy turn of phrase – the real-life model for Betty Boop, Helen Kane, “sang as if her tongue tingled with rumour and gossip” – and a fantastic eye for an obscure, head-turning fact. Down at the Old Bull and Bush – “the very soul of cockney London”, as Stanley puts it – was originally written by two Americans, in New York, as an advert for Budweiser beer. At the height of the second world war, the BBC pulled Vera Lynn off the air for a year, deeming the Forces’ Sweetheart “flabby entertainment”. The Muppets’ Miss Piggy was originally known as Miss Piggy Lee, a porcine tribute to the singer of Fever and Is That All There Is?. Stanley is admirably unsnobby in his approach. He stands up for the oft-reviled Glenn Miller Orchestra, who even at the height of their fame were derided as too commercial and diluted: in their riff-heavy, solo-free music he hears pop’s postwar future. He is brilliant on the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, authors of the first jazz 78 rpm record, but widely seen as white musicians who got lucky, securing their place in history by dint of the colour of their skin and the fact that trumpeter Freddie Keppard turned down the chance to record before them, believing others would steal his sound. Stanley convincingly argues that they were “the first recognisably modern pop group”, complete with an image, gimmicks, a talent for self-mythologising and a neat line in snappily provocative interview quotes: “Jazz is the assassination, the slaying, the murdering of syncopation,” offered leader Nick LaRocca, punk-ishly, “we are musical anarchists”. Let’s Do It’s masterstroke in bringing the past to life lies in drawing parallels with the present, or at least more contemporary history. The music industry, it seems, held its audience in contempt long before cynically manufactured pop reared its head: the degree of nose-holding involved in the first recordings of country music – aimed, in the words of Variety magazine, at “poor white trash … with the intelligence of morons” – is quite something to behold. In 1910, a New York Times writer was complaining that music had become too mechanised and soulless, decrying the “factory output” of Tin Pan Alley: at every juncture in musical history since, there’s been someone like him, saying something like that. The moral panic caused by hot jazz in the 1920s is clearly the model for every subsequent moral panic caused by pop: ostensibly about licentious behaviour and intoxication, but tacitly driven by fears about race, class and gender. Perhaps most strikingly of all, Let’s Do It makes clear that people have always been obsessed with the past. We tend to think of retro-revivalism as an aspect of pop in a postmodern age, but there was a revival of Edwardian Viennese operetta in the mid 1930s, driven by exactly the same forces that have driven every revival since: an older audience distrustful of where music was going coupled with a younger audience seduced by a romantic notion of a past they were too young to remember. The Barbershop quartet, meanwhile, turns out to be a latter-day construct, based on a deliberate misremembering of a supposedly prelapsarian era: clearly a liking for striped blazers wasn’t the only thing they had in common with the mod revivalists of the late 70s. This is one of the moments in Let’s Do It when the distant past seems more familiar than foreign, although there are plenty of the latter, too. Its 656 pages are a perfect guidebook, filled with smart thinking and the kind of communicable enthusiasm that sends you rushing to the nearest streaming service, eager to hear what all the fuss was about.

5/6/2022,"For a member of one of the most august and venerable institutions in American public life, Samuel Alito has provoked an astonishing outpouring of jarring adjectives this week. “Appalling and heinous” – Vanity Fair; “acidic and extreme” – Slate; “dreadful and repugnant” – the Washington Post; “scathing and dismissive” – Los Angeles Times. The strong words were directed at the draft ruling written by Alito and leaked to Politico that, barring a possible but unlikely change of heart by any of Alito’s conservative peers on the US supreme court, will eviscerate federal abortion rights in America. Though millions had been bracing themselves for the court’s newly emboldened rightwing majority to deliver a blow to Roe v Wade, the constitutional right to abortion that has been law of the land for half a century, Alito’s attack was so brutal and direct it still left many dumbstruck. “Roe and Casey must be overruled,” Alito wrote, referring to the 1973 landmark ruling along with its 1992 affirmation in Planned Parenthood v Casey. “Roe was egregiously wrong from the start.” It is conceivable that some of the sharper edges of Alito’s devastating 98-page screed will be smoothed out before the final ruling is delivered in coming weeks. Other supreme court justices, notably Brett Kavanaugh, might demand as much in order to spare their own blushes. But none of that will alter the fact that Alito will forever be known as the supreme court justice who destroyed a woman’s right to control her own body and who set the US on a regressive course pointing back to the 17th century. At least that’s what is suggested by some of the juridical reasoning that Alito deploys in his draft ruling. As Emily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, noted, the draft draws heavily from two treatises written by an English jurist, Sir Matthew Hale, describing abortion as a “great crime” and a “great misprision”. No matter that Hale was writing in 1673. Or that, as Bell pointed out, his distinguished career included securing the executions of two women as witches and writing the definitive text for a marital rape exemption that said that husbands cannot be culpable of raping their wives because “by their mutual matrimonial consent and contract the wife hath given up herself”. Alito leans on Hale and other voices from the distant past to underline his main contention: that “the Constitution makes no reference to abortion” and as a result there can be no constitutional right. He glides over the fact that the constitution, written in 1787, equally makes no reference to airplanes, car license plates or Snapchat, though that hasn’t prevented the nine justices applying constitutional laws to those fields. Alito’s other central argument in scuppering Roe is that constitutional rights have to be “deeply rooted in the Nation’s history and traditions”. Yet, interestingly, that standard makes no appearance in the US constitution either. That Alito should have made such an abrasively aggressive, no-holds-barred, demolition of Roe v Wade comes as no surprise to those who have observed his style of jurisprudence up close. The justice has a famously quick temper and razor-sharp tongue that he’s even prepared to turn against his colleagues on the conservative side of the court – especially the chief justice, John Roberts, who is looking increasingly isolated amid the rightward march of the majority. Alito responded derisively to a recent opinion written by Roberts in a religious liberty case relating to same-sex couples fostering children. The ruling sided with the religious group, but for Alito that wasn’t enough. “This decision might as well be written on the dissolving paper sold in magic shops,” Alito complained. “He’s very intelligent, extremely aggressive, often sarcastic,” one lawyer who has argued a case in front of Alito told the Guardian. “He’s not pleasant to argue in front of. Other justices are incisive but conversational questioners – he is combative and hostile towards people he doesn’t agree with.” Alito, 72, was born in Trenton, New Jersey, to an immigrant Italian father and Italian-American mother. Educated at Princeton and Yale law school, he rose up the legal ladder through the US Department of Justice (DoJ) in the Ronald Reagan years. George W Bush nominated him for a seat on the nation’s highest court in 2006. His anti-abortion tendencies stretch far back. In 1985, in a job application for a post at the DoJ, he boasted about his contribution arguing before the supreme court that “the constitution does not protect a right to an abortion” – the exact same line he pursues in his draft ruling 37 years later. In the same job application he also bragged about having argued before the court that “racial and ethnic quotas should not be allowed”. That presents a chilling portent of his position in a separate blockbuster case scheduled to be heard by the supreme court next term that challenges affirmative action at Harvard and the University of North Carolina. Since joining the court he has staked his position, alongside Clarence Thomas, as the gatekeeper of the court’s reactionary wing. With the recent addition of fellow conservatives nominated by Donald Trump – Neil Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett – his star is now in the ascendant. In 2007 he wrote the majority opinion that declined an appeal from Lilly Ledbetter that would have established equal pay for women, on grounds that she had missed a filing deadline. Barack Obama’s riposte came in his very first act as president when he signed into law the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act. The bad blood between the two men thickened in 2010 when Obama used his State of the Union speech to criticize the supreme court for unleashing corporate money into elections with its contentious Citizens United ruling, which Alito supported. “Not true”, lip readers could clearly discern the justice muttering. A lifelong Catholic who has frequently expressed his fear that the US is moving away from traditional values, the justice has also been at the forefront of the conservative push to advantage religious belief against individual liberty. He wrote the majority opinion in the 2014 Hobby Lobby case that allowed Christian-run companies to forgo contraception in their health insurance packages. That leaning could prove significant should Alito’s draft ruling overturning Roe become final, potentially unleashing a whirlwind of regressive opinions from the court. Top of the list of vulnerable targets is same-sex marriage. In his draft ruling, Alito goes out of his way to reassure those concerned about the future of gay marriage by saying that his stance on Roe was unique as “abortion is fundamentally different”. That’s not what he wrote in his dissent to Obergefell, the 2015 ruling that guaranteed the right of same-sex couples to marry. In it, he asked whether the constitution gives a view on what to do about gay marriage. “It does not,” he said. “The Constitution leaves that question to be decided by the people of each state.” If that argument sounds familiar, that’s because it is. It’s identical to the reasoning he presents in his draft ruling eviscerating the right to an abortion.",News/Law,Samuel Alito: the abrasive justice taking abortion rights back to the 17th century,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/may/06/samuel-alito-profile-abortion-supreme-court-justice
5/6/2022,"A plan to station more police officers in remote parts of the Northern Territory is a “direct threat” to the safety of Aboriginal people, Warlpiri elders have said. Northern Territory police minister Nicole Manison on Thursday announced that spending on police and emergency services in the 2022 budget would be increased to a record $510m, including $10.1m to fund an additional 21 police officers and 30 Aboriginal liaison officers in regional and remote areas. It comes two months after Northern Territory police officer Zachery Rolfe was found not guilty of murder over the fatal shooting of Warlpiri man Kumanjayi Walker. Walker was shot in the remote community of Yuendumu in 2019. Warlpiri elders from Yuendumu have issued a statement calling for police to stop carrying guns in Aboriginal communities, and said the police budget would be better directed at self-determined Aboriginal governance rather than further police oversight. “This funding increase is a direct threat to our lives in our community.” senior Warlpiri elder, Ned Jampijinpa Hargraves, said. “More funding for police means more police violence against our people. Karrinjarla muwajarri! This must stop! We demand a police ceasefire! No more police guns. The only safe way forward for our people is for our local First Nations authority to be empowered and for funding to go to our community controlled services.” Manison said investing in more Aboriginal police liaison officers would build stronger relationships with remote communities. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “We know that maintaining local relationships and engagements is vital for our police and this investment is an important step in increasing safety out in our communities,” she said. “We will always back our police and the complex work that they do right across the Territory, in some of the most remote regions in the country.” The Yuendumu community has called for a national day of action on 18 June to end police shootings. It is supported by the Human Rights Law Centre, which said that the voices of elders and community members at Yuendumu should play a central role in the steps taken by the Territory government to restore the broken trust in the justice system. “Yuendumu community has started the conversation about what is needed to address the systemic injustices faced by Aboriginal people,” legal director Nick Espie said. According to the Australian Institute of Criminology, six of the 16 deaths in police custody in 2020-2021 were the result of police shootings. All were non-Indigenous people. In the year Walker died, 2019-2020, there were 16 fatal police shootings, two of which resulted in the death of an Indigenous person.",News/Australia news,"More police in remote NT areas is a ‘direct threat’ to Aboriginal community, elders say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/06/more-police-in-remote-nt-areas-is-a-direct-threat-to-aboriginal-community-elders-say
