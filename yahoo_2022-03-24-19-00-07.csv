3/24/2022,"The Republican Party has morphed into something completely different since former President Donald Trump took control, radio icon Howard Stern said. “The whole Republican Party’s gone bonkers,” Stern said Wednesday on his SiriusXM radio show, according to The Hill. Stern also described the GOP as the “wacko party.” “There’s so many wackos. I miss the old Republican Party. It used to be nice to have a two-party system,” he said. Stern then tore into the “wackos” for resisting masks and refusing to get vaccinated during the global coronavirus pandemic. “I hate to say it, but only 65 percent of Americans are fully vaccinated, and I can’t help but think the wackos are winning,” he said. Stern also gave Republicans who believe Trump’s “big lie” about the 2020 election a reality check. Trump has claimed the election, which he lost, was rigged. Stern agreed, just not in the way the former president thinks. The rigging, according to Stern, is the Electoral College system, which allows someone to lose the popular vote as Trump did in 2016 and still become president. “The stupidity of the way we have our voting set up. The system was rigged — Trump’s right. It was rigged in his favor,” he said. “It was absolutely absurd that this guy got to be the president of the United States.” This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.",Politics/HuffPost,Howard Stern Gives 'Wacko Party' Trump Fans A Brutal Election Reality Check,https://news.yahoo.com/howard-stern-gives-wacko-party-093422279.html
3/24/2022,"On Tuesday, Aliko Dangote, the richest person in Africa, opened the continent's largest fertilizer plant. The Nigeria plant's opening comes amid disruptions in fertilizer supplies due to sanctions against Russia. Dangote said demand is robust, with customers ""begging"" for supplies. On Tuesday, Africa's richest person, Aliko Dangote, opened the continent's largest fertilizer plant in Nigeria. Demand is already knocking at the door. ""People are begging us to sell,"" Dangote told CNN on Tuesday. Sitting on 500 hectares (1,235 acres) of land on the outskirts of Lagos, the $2.5 billion fertilizer plant has an initial annual production capacity of 3 million metric tons of urea fertilizer, according to information on the Dangote Group's website. The opening of the Dangote Fertiliser Plant comes amid a supply crunch in crop fertilizers due to sanctions against Russia, which accounted for almost one-fifth of 2021 fertilizer exports, according to Trade Data Monitor and Bloomberg's Green Markets. Russia is also a top exporter in key fertilizer ingredients such as urea, ammonia, and potash, per trade outlet Argus Media. The supply strain has sent fertilizer prices soaring, with the Bloomberg Green Markets North America Fertilizer Price Index surging to record highs. This, in turn, is expected to feed into already soaring food prices. ""We are lucky to have this plant,"" Dangote told CNN. ""It is coming at the right time with the Ukraine-Russia conflict as both Ukraine and Russia control substantial amounts of agricultural inputs."" Dangote's fertilizer plant is already shipping to the US, Brazil, and India, CNN reported, citing the Dangote. Dangote, 64, is the 80th-richest person in the world with a net worth of $20 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The Dangote Group, which he founded, is the second-largest employer in Nigeria after the government, the country's Vanguard News outlet reported recently, citing the Nigerian president. The Dangote Fertiliser Plant is expected to create 5,000 direct and indirect jobs, Vanguard News reported, citing a government official. Amid the war in Ukraine, resource-rich African economies are tipped to benefit from sweeping sanctions against Russia, the world's third-largest oil producer. ""As the European Union and the United States impose sanctions to deny Russia access to European oil and gas markets, oil-producing African countries could seize on the opportunity,"" wrote Mvemba Phezo Dizolele, director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in a recent note. Oil companies may also expand prospecting operations on the continent, he added.

3/24/2022,"Retired U.S. Army Maj. Gen. James Marks put the blame for Russia’s reportedly faltering invasion of Ukraine firmly on Russian President Vladimir Putin and his excessive pride. Marks, now a military analyst for CNN, said Wednesday that Putin likely thought the invasion would be a 48-hour “cakewalk” with cities across Ukraine falling quickly to his troops. The war is now in its fourth week with the United Nations estimating that some 7,000 to 15,000 Russian troops have been killed so far. “I mean, that’s hubris,” Marks told anchor Pamela Brown. “That’s a misunderstanding, a strategic miscalculation that’s incredibly huge. And Putin is in the intel business and he totally blew it. I mean, that’s phenomenal.” Russian forces were ill-prepared to successfully invade Ukraine as a direct result of Putin’s arrogance, Marks continued. “They thought they would … get into Kyiv and they’d immediately be welcomed and they’d have an opportunity to be replenished in (a) short amount of time. That has been totally exposed,” he explained. An “incredible lack of leadership” meant supplies couldn’t get to the front line and Russian soldiers didn’t know what they were supposed to do, nor crucially why they were doing it. “I mean, it’s a total collapse of the Russian military,” he added.

3/24/2022,"They couldn’t ignore Arnold Schwarzenegger for long: After failing to contain the actor’s lengthy video directly urging the Russian people to see through state-sponsored lies, Moscow mouthpieces went on offense. Schwarzenegger’s personal-appeal video was viewed by millions across Twitter and Telegram, the latter of which is used mostly by Russians, according to the Daily Beast. After a few days of pretending there was nothing to see here, pro-Russia voices from inside the warring nation began to push back this week. “That face is the cover page of American imperialism and colonialism,” a “visibly furious” TV host Vadim Gigin said on “Sunday Evening with Vladimir Solovievon,” according to the Beast. “Not the caricature image of Uncle Sam, but this Schwarz, in a Hollywood production.” Gigin took particular issue with the former California Governor’s remarks about how he admires Russians while at the same time implying that they are being fooled about Vladimir Putin’s relentless and destructive invasion of Ukraine. “He, in California, will tell us, who live here … the truth?!” Gigin fumred. “That is their approach towards us.” Gigin’s fury was joined by Russian power-lifter Maryana Naumova, who told a Russian tabloid that Schwarzenegger is “living in alternative, imaginary reality.” “Do you remember how in the second part of the Terminator your hero goes back in time to prevent the creation of Skynet, which would bring the death of all mankind?” she reportedly said in her comments to Komsomolskaya. “Russia’s special military operation does not aim to destroy the Ukrainian people. It is aimed at the neo-Nazi Skynet, which over the years has completely subjugated Ukraine and was about to turn into an uncontrollable monster, dangerous for all of its neighbors, not only for us … Don’t side with Skynet, Terminator.” And well-known Russian writer Zakhar Prilepin, himself wanted by Ukrainian security forces for alleged ties to a “terrorist organization,” lashed out at Schwarzenegger. According to a translation by the Beast, Prilepin posted on his Telegram: “In his video message, Schwarzenegger, who killed three million Russians in his films, told the Russian people how much he loves us and how wrong we are about Ukraine … This Austrian, the son of his father, who served in the SS and was wounded near Leningrad, is trying to act as the good cop.” Prilepin also appeared as a guest on Soloviev’s Sunday show, saying the West is “pumping Ukraine full of weapons to massacre the Russians,” despite his country being the aggressor, adding: “Arnie, you are a predator and an enemy.” “If they’re seriously afraid of the conflict with Russia, of WWIII, of nuclear war or the escalation of the conflict, we should be convincing them that we’re ready for it, that we love it, that we like to make war.” Messages sent to a rep for Schwarzenegger were not immediately returned Tuesday.",U.S./The Wrap,‘Visibly Furious’ Russian TV Talking Heads Rage at Arnold Schwarzenegger: ‘Don’t Side With Skynet’,https://news.yahoo.com/visibly-furious-russian-tv-talking-153823830.html
