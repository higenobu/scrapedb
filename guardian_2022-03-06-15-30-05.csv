3/6/2022,"In November 2017, a bank with close links to the Kremlin was revealed to have funded a £140m investment in Twitter. The share acquisition made by DST Global, founded by the Russian-born billionaire Yuri Milner, was financed by the Kremlin-controlled VTB Bank, now under UK sanctions, leaked documents revealed. Milner said at the time it was a “fairytale” to suggest the investment bought in May 2011 may have been used to influence social media on Russia’s behalf. He said DST Global was a “passive investor”. While the Twitter shares are now sold, corporate filings reveal the “care of” address for the DST Global entities holding the shares was a four-storey townhouse in Mayfair, London. This stucco-fronted property is the base of Alistair Tulloch, one of the best-connected lawyers among Russia’s super-rich. Over the years, those who have tried to unpick the financial paper trails of Russian investments, oligarchs and officials have found it is Tulloch’s name – or the address of his legal firm, Tulloch & Co – that frequently pops up on the paperwork. An investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in October last year, based on the leaked offshore documents known as the Pandora Papers, reported that Tulloch’s law firm helped manage offshore companies for former Russian deputy finance minister Andrey Vavilov and Vitaly Zhogin, a Russian banker. Property records and company filings involving Tulloch’s firm also lead to other former Kremlin politicians and Russian business figures. These include Igor Shuvalov, Russia’s former deputy prime minister, who was last week sanctioned by the UK government after pressure from Labour leader Keir Starmer. Shuvalov owns two flats in Whitehall, fitted with chandeliers and marble furnishings. A previous filing on Land Registry records reveals the “care of” address for the registered property owner was Tulloch’s legal firm. Oxford-educated Tulloch is also a trustee of various charities. These include the Mamut Foundation, linked to the Moscow-based billionaire Alexander Mamut. In 2014, Mamut fired Galina Timchenko, the editor of his Russian news site Lenta.ru, over an interview she published with a far-right Ukrainian nationalist. She was replaced by a pro-Kremlin journalist. Charity Commission records show the Mamut Foundation made two grants of £100,000 each to Eton College in 2016 and 2017 in support of its library. Eton College said last week it had received no further funds from the charity. It did not comment on whether it had established Alexander Mamut was behind the charity. Tulloch said: “We fully comply with UK regulations. And obviously, in today’s world, we are incredibly sensitive to people from Russia, and we make sure that everybody is properly assessed.” It is claimed such regulations have been too lax because politicians have long been reluctant to disrupt the links that were being forged with Russia. It has meant that London – called “Londongrad” by critics – has become a nexus for Russian money and a global professional services hub for the country’s oligarchy. At a Conservative summer ball in June 2013, a London-based public relations firm, New Century Media, was revealed to have invited two prominent Russians – Vasily Shestakov, an MP in the Russian Duma and a friend of Vladimir Putin, and Andrei Klyamko, a Russian billionaire. Both men were pictured with then prime minister David Cameron. Legal filings also reveal that New Century Media acted for the oligarch Vladimir Makhlay, who entered the UK on a golden visa. The fee for services, including “reputation management”, was £75,000 a month. New Century Media has given more than £200,000 to the Conservative party, and is chaired by the former Ulster Unionist MP David Burnside. Another firm which benefited from Russian links is the concierge firm Quintessentially, co-founded by Ben Elliot, co-chair of the Conservative party. “It is not enough to simply have money,” states a recently deleted webpage for potential Russian clients on the company’s site. “One has to have proper contacts to maximise the use of that money.” The firm said it condemned the Ukraine invasion and had vetted its clients, ensuring none were on the sanctions list. Lawyers who have been hired to pursue legal actions against journalists involved in scrutiny of the Russian oligarchy are also in the spotlight. The Conservative MP Bob Seely used parliamentary privilege last week to name lawyers who had worked in connection with Russian oligarchs. A spokesperson for New Century Media said: “We fully condemn the military action in Ukraine. Neither Mr Shestakov nor Mr Klyamko were ever clients of New Century Media. New Century Media has no Russian billionaire or Russian state-owned clients. We have never worked with any sanctioned individuals.” DST Global said the international firm, with offices in London, New York and Beijing, had not raised capital from Russian limited partners since 2011. It said less than 3% of capital it had raised from inception was from VTB Bank and all such capital was returned by 2014. The firm said Milner had been an Israeli citizen since the late 1990s and had relocated to the US in 2014.

3/6/2022,"Tamerán Baboso Blanco, Gran Canaria, Spain 2020 (£48, thesourcingtable.com) You can trace the change in the status of footballers over the past 30 years in the sort of booze-related side hustles and retirement projects they get up to. Where once the conventional ambition for ex-pros was to run a pub, today’s players are just as likely to end up owning a vineyard or winery. Or, at least, that’s what a certain strain of player – specifically the kind of soft-shoed southern European that commentators tend to describe as sophisticated – seems to wind up doing. Examples include strolling Italian pass master Andrea Pirlo, who is involved in his family’s vineyard, Pratum Coller, near Brescia in Lombardy, and impish Barcelona and Spain winger Andrés Iniesta, who has an eponymous bodega he runs with his father in Spain’s Manchuela region in Castilla la Mancha. By far the most impressive playmaker cuvée I’ve tasted so far, however, is Manchester City and Spain international David Silva’s Gran Canaria white. Studio by Miraval Rosé, Provence, France 2020 (£12, Tesco, Asda) What makes the Silva wine so special is its gorgeous interplay of ripe quince, pithy lemon and a mouthwatering salty-smoky mineral quality with gravity-defying balance and a richness that belies its slight 12% abv frame: the perfect reflection of the diminutive Silva’s subtle gifts as a footballer, and also on display in the other Taméran wine I got to try: the Mavalsia Volcánica 2020. Both wines are made by the supremely talented winemaker Jonatan García, whose equally arresting work at his own Suertes del Marqués project in Tenerife’s Orotava Valley is also well worth seeking out. Picking the right collaborator is what marks out most of the best celebrity wines. Certainly partnering with the Perrin Family – makers of top Châteauneuf-du-Pape Château de Beaucastel among other excellent Rhône wines – to make their elegant rosés, has to be one of the better life decisions made by the two halves of the now-broken Brangelina brand. Two Paddocks Pinot Noir, Central Otago, New Zealand 2019 (£31.95, hhandc.co.uk) The quality of Tamerán and, to a lesser extent, Miraval, make them exceptions to the general celebrity wine rule, where the wines wouldn’t merit so much as a passing mention were it not for the bought-in glamour of the name on the label. Still, the list keeps growing with stars of sport (Ian Botham, golfer Ernie Els), pop and rock (Kylie, Pink, Sting), and film and TV (Sarah Jessica Parker, Graham Norton) all involved to varying degrees in wines of varying degrees of not bad. A cut above, most likely because he is both closely involved in the day-to-day running of the estate and is clearly a very keen wine lover, is New Zealand actor Sam Neill’s Two Paddocks estate in Central Otago. Neill specialises in wonderfully expressive, lithe and luminously fruity pinot noir. It pairs very well with a screening of my favourite of his film performances: the reluctant father figure in fellow New Zealander Taika Waititi’s poignant comedy-drama, The Hunt for the Wilderpeople.

3/6/2022,"Giuseppe Spagnuolo wakes up at about 6am each day, eats the leftovers of the previous night’s dinner for breakfast, greets the stray cats he calls his “security guards” and clambers down the steps of his crumbling home to splash his face with water from the fountain in the square. Occasionally, he walks up to the next village, if his “aches and pains” allow, for coffee in the bar. For 25 years, Spagnuolo has been the only inhabitant in Roscigno Vecchia, a long-abandoned hamlet 400m up a mountain in the Cilento area of Italy’s southern Campania region. “If you’ve experienced the school of life like I have, then you can easily live this way,” the 74-year-old said, sitting in front of the fire in his kitchen, which is cluttered with pots, pans, bottles of wine, tinned tomatoes, cheese and hanging salamis. Roscigno Vecchia is among hundreds of ghost towns across Italy, some of which authorities are now trying to bring back to life with money from the EU’s post-Covid recovery fund. The hamlet was founded in 1515, when a monk established a retreat before shepherds settled in with their flocks. Houses, shops, stables, a church and the fountain, which was the centrepiece of the large square, were built; donkey tracks wound through the narrow streets, leading to the fields beyond. By the early 20th century, Roscigno Vecchia was home to about 1,200 people, who lived a simple life sustained by farm work before an order was issued for them to evacuate their homes due to landslide risks. A new town, Roscigno Nuovo, was built 1km away, although the majority of inhabitants didn’t move there until the mid-1960s, when malaria struck. Spagnuolo was born in the new town and left home at 14, moving to Lombardy to work as an apprentice carpenter. He met his Italian wife in Switzerland, where he worked as a construction labourer. The couple had four children and eventually the family moved back to Roscigno Nuovo. But Spagnuolo struggled to find work, and his marriage hit difficulties that were compounded when his father-in-law moved in. He said the home “wasn’t big enough for two grown men”, and so in 1997 he moved into a deserted house, with no electricity or running water, in Roscigno Vecchia. He said the fire, which he uses to cook, is enough to warm the place, and candles make do for light. His wife still lives nearby, and their relationship is amicable. Spagnuolo, who is rarely seen without his trademark pipe, is often labelled “the last inhabitant” of Roscigno Vecchia, although this is not strictly true. The last official resident was Teodora Lorenzo, who had resisted leaving her home before her death in 2000, aged 85. A picture of her has pride of place in the town hall in Roscigno Nuovo. Still, the fact that Spagnuolo is the only resident has made him a star around the world, helping put Roscigno Vecchia quite literally back on the map (until a few years ago there were no road signs marking the way to the hamlet), and turning him into a de facto tour guide, supporting Pro Loco, the association behind a museum that recounts Roscigno’s history. Curious tourists often bring food, drink and other gifts. “This hat I’m wearing is from Belize,” he said. “As is the tie.” Spagnuolo may be living there unlawfully, but he’s an asset for the authorities, and a free one at that. “Giuseppe had the intelligence to occupy a space that was empty, and create a personality … so people come and find him, and he tells them the story of Roscigno,” said mayor Pino Palmieri. “So he provides a service, which I don’t have to pay for.” Just as well. Palmieri was recently left seething after Roscigno Vecchia failed to qualify as a candidate for a slice of a €1bn Covid recovery fund, that Italy is spending on reviving either abandoned or semi-abandoned towns. Palmieri acknowledges that, by law, it’s not safe to repopulate the old hamlet owing to its unstable conditions, but he would still like it to be recognised as a cultural resource. He is now seeking money to restore the church, repair the winding road leading up to Roscigno and open up the little-known Monte Pruno archaeological site, located a further 500m up the mountain, to tourism, while potentially turning the area into a centre for archaeological and geological studies. “Giuseppe is like a point of reference for tourists,” said Palmieri. “And combined with that, we would like to encourage people to stay for a few days by investing in our other resources.” Spagnuolo hardly reads newspapers, and gets snippets of what’s going on in the world from his visitors and from conversations during his trips to the bar in Roscigno Nuovo, although he said the clientele mostly talk about football. Covid has passed him by, while the lockdowns made no difference to the rhythm of his day. He said he never feels lonely, “as the world comes to me”. A self-described vagabond, Spagnuolo doesn’t know if he’ll stay in Roscigno Vecchia for the rest of his life. “I have everything I need here, and I take things one day at a time,” he said.",News/World news,How one man’s love of isolation put an Italian ghost town on the map ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/06/how-one-mans-love-of-isolation-put-an-italian-ghost-town-on-the-map-giuseppe-spagnuolo-roscigno-vecchia
3/6/2022,"For years, if not decades, the luxury property market in London and south-east England has been feasting on investment from Russia and former Soviet states. The oligarch’s mansion, with fantastical multi-level interiors containing swimming pools, art galleries and vintage car collections, has become the stuff of legend. Estate agents, lawyers, accountants, financial institutions, property companies, public relations agencies, architects and interior designers have all done well out of this abundant cash. Meanwhile, campaigners and journalists have been sounding the alarm. London, they have long pointed out, appeared to be uniquely attractive to “suspicious wealth” – as the anti-corruption organisation Transparency International UK puts it – from all over the world, and from the former Soviet Union in particular. These alarms were mostly ignored until now, when suddenly it appears problematic to have been complicit in the workings of elites whose leader has started the most dangerous war in Europe since 1945. The only possible (and insufficient) justification is that this influx of money would trickle down to ordinary citizens, but it has been of questionable benefit to most Londoners. It has added further pressure on London’s famously unaffordable homes. It has promoted exclusion and division in a city whose strengths included openness and accessibility. Most, for sure, would never be in the market in the places where oligarchs and kleptocrats like to buy, such as Knightsbridge, Kensington, parts of Highgate, and in suburban gated communities such as St George’s Hill near Weybridge, Surrey. But, as Transparency International has also argued, there has been a ripple effect: if billionaires buy in Kensington, then slightly less loaded bankers start to look in marginally less expensive districts, where the most successful professionals might be pushed further afield, and so on, until first-time buyers in outer boroughs find that their studio flats are a notch more pricey. This wealth has contributed to such unwelcome phenomena as the “iceberg house”, where colossal basements maximise square footage in high-value areas, and “ghost streets”, where owners of properties around the world are only occasionally in residence at their London address. It has also led to the phenomenon where entire apartment blocks are largely dark most of the time, their owners elsewhere. Suspect cash distorts the market, encouraging voluminous homes in a city where space is always in short supply. The oligarch’s house of popular imagination is something like Roman Abramovich’s 15-bedroom house, worth at least £150m, in Kensington Palace Gardens, one of the most expensive streets in the world, or the house in Belgrave Square believed to belong to Oleg Deripaska, the Putin ally who is under sanctions in the US. Here the value of the stuccoed classically styled house, the London staple where Paddington Bear would have lived, is inflated to unimaginable proportions, its spirit utterly changed. Another type is the house that approaches the scale of a stately home, but somehow finds itself in London. These include Athlone House, a turreted and gabled Jacobean-style fantasy in Highgate that was bought for £65m in 2016 by Mikhail Fridman, a man sanctioned by the EU, which described him as an “enabler of Putin’s inner circle”. Or there is an actual country house such as Sutton Place, a 72-room Tudor building in Surrey that is believed to belong to the recently sanctioned mining billionaire Alisher Usmanov, a former major shareholder of Arsenal Football Club and an investor in Everton. There is the suburban mansion in a gated estate, such as the art-filled Palladian Ingliston House in Virginia Water, Surrey, that belongs to Fridman’s business partner Petr Aven, who has also been sanctioned. Or Hamstone House, an art deco palace in St George’s Hill that used to belong to Deripaska and may still. The most spectacular mansion of all is Witanhurst in north London, owned by the phosphates magnate Andrey Guryev. Often called the capital’s second-largest family house after Buckingham Palace, its already ample proportions were enlarged by a colossal basement. An essential aspect of these properties is their redundant scale. Robert Adam, a purveyor of classical architecture who designed the makeover of Witanhurst, once told the New Yorker that “houses are a major expression of people’s status and ambition and dreams … You can’t put the word ‘need’ on this. The word is ‘want’.” Similar superfluity can be seen in the decision of the Putin-friendly Ukrainian Dmytro Firtash to buy the disused Brompton Road underground station, even though he already owned a magnificent modern house nearby. Other essential aspects are security, privacy and disconnection. All these factors were industrialised into the single entity of One Hyde Park, an apartment block in Knightsbridge which, although designed by the liberal-minded practice of Rogers Stirk Harbour and Partners, offers extreme security and exclusivity. Residents have included Russian tycoon Vladislav Doronin and Ukrainian billionaire Rinat Akhmetov, who early in the last decade paid a then-record £136.4m for a penthouse there. The literal transparency of its glassy walls belies the actual opacity of its interior life. It offers little to the liveliness of streets around it. Its height breaks through the horizon of Hyde Park in a way which, compared to later and higher buildings in London, seems almost modest. Bigger, higher and similarly excluding towers can now be seen in the Nine Elms area around the American embassy. These don’t seem to be particularly favoured by Russians, but it’s probable that some of the purchases there are funded from suspect sources. Fridman, Deripaska and Doronin have to different degrees questioned Putin’s war, and Deripaska has challenged the sanctions placed on him. So have Fridman and Aven, describing them as “malicious and deliberate falsehoods”. It is also impossible to trace the funding for the purchase of any of the above properties, and establish with certainty whether any of it was corruptly gained. What we do know is that, as Transparency International put it, £6.7bn of questionable funds has been invested in UK property since 2016, of which at least £1.5bn “has been bought by Russians accused of corruption or links to the Kremlin”. Given the secrecy of many transactions, says Transparency International, the true total is almost certainly many times that. As Oliver Bullough explains in his 2018 book Moneyland, ownership can be obscured through the use of shell companies, businesses that do little or nothing except hold and move assets, in countries – St Kitts and Nevis, Bermuda, Liechtenstein – whose laws make them “a formidable fortress for anyone seeking to protect their assets”. The attractions of London include the paradoxical fact that its legal system is considered robust and trustworthy and its politics, for now at least, stable. In other words, it has precisely those institutions whose absence helps kleptocrats to extract wealth from their own countries. Once their loot has been converted into land and masonry, behind a creamy stucco Victorian facade, the process is hard to reverse. All of which requires enablers. As the Panama Papers revealed, the London law firm Child & Child assisted the daughters of the president of Azerbaijan in a way that, according to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal, “led to a risk of large amounts of money being laundered”. In the Channel 4 documentary From Russia With Cash, reporters posing as Russian buyers approached London estate agents asking to invest in properties with what they made clear were ill-gotten gains. The agents were highly obliging, in several cases recommending lawyers who could help the buyers hide their identities. This was in 2015, and it was hardly a surprise even then that such things could happen. Yet the government’s response has been limited. Unexplained wealth orders, whereby British courts can require their targets to reveal the sources of the money, were introduced in 2017, but the cost of using them against well-lawyered respondents mean that they are rarely issued. David Cameron promised to shut out “dirty cash” in 2015, and in 2016 the British government promised to introduce a public register of foreign-owned property. Six years later, Boris Johnson is still promising to rush forward such a register. “There is no place for dirty money in the UK,” he recently intoned. “Those backing Putin have been put on notice: there will be nowhere to hide your ill-gotten gains.” Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said that she has a “hit list” of oligarchs whose properties will be targeted. The deputy prime minister, Dominic Raab, has suggested that the homes of Russian elites could be handed to Ukrainian refugees. Given that the government has convincingly been accused of dragging its feet, these ministerial statements, until proved otherwise, sound like virtue signalling.",News/UK news,How London became the place to be for Putin’s oligarchs,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/06/how-london-became-the-place-to-be-for-putins-oligarchs
3/6/2022,"Prominent women, including the former Australian of the year Grace Tame and the former Liberal staffer Brittany Higgins, are launching a fresh call for the Morrison government to implement significant policies to protect women and children from violence, harassment and discrimination. On the eve of International Women’s Day, the new coalition – which includes Christine Holgate, Lucy Turnbull, the former Liberal MP Julia Banks, as well as the film-maker and Indigenous advocate Larissa Behrendt, the youth advocate Yasmin Poole, the president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Michele O’Neil, the businesswoman Wendy McCarthy, the consent activist Chanel Contos, the Paralympic gold medalist Madison de Rozario, and The Parenthood’s Georgie Dent – has launched a social media campaign to press for reforms. The high-powered group is calling on the government to implement the central recommendation of the Respect@Work report – imposing a positive duty on employers to safeguard their staff from sexual harassment. In addition, the call is for 10 days paid family and domestic violence leave, full implementation of the National Plan for First Nations Women and Girls, ensuring effective employment programs for women with disability, enacting stronger and consistent child sexual assault laws, and legislative measures to address the gender pay gap. The group is also seeking the provision of free, accessible and quality early childhood education and care, expansion of paid parental leave, and embedding respectful relationships and consent education in schools, universities, workplaces and homes. In a new video message fronted by members of the coalition, the women make it clear they want to continue the momentum of 2021 – an extraordinary year where thousands of Australian women and their allies took part in public demonstrations triggered by a #MeToo moment in the Australian parliament. In February, Scott Morrison, along with other political leaders, apologised for the “terrible things” that happened in parliament workplaces and acknowledged a culture of bullying, abuse, harassment “and in some cases even violence” built up over decades. Morrison’s apology followed a landmark review by Australia’s sex discrimination commissioner, Kate Jenkins, in 2021 into federal parliament’s culture. The Jenkins review, which recommended a significant overhaul of the workplace culture, found one in three staffers interviewed had been sexually harassed. That inquiry was constituted after Higgins, a former government adviser, alleged she was raped by a colleague after hours in a Parliament House ministerial office in March 2019. The new social media campaign video opens with Tame, a survivor of sexual assault, declaring: “Australia – we need to talk”. The women note that 2021 “wasn’t the first year that women in Australia were harassed or unsafe or ignored or disrespected”. “It wasn’t even the first year that women spoke up about these things. But in 2021 more Australians started to listen to women of different ages, occupations and beliefs, who stood up and spoke out, exposing discrimination, harassment, sexism, disrespect and intimidation,” they say. “And the more people listened, the more familiar the story became”. In a joint statement, members of the coalition noted one in five Australian women would be sexually assaulted or raped in her lifetime, and one in three women would encounter workplace sexual harassment. Poole, Plan International’s national ambassador and advocate for girls’ rights, noted: “If you’re a First Nations woman, a woman of colour, have a disability or identify as LGBTIQ+, those statistics are even worse.” Separately, the Morrison government announced on Sunday it would spend $189m over five years on strengthening prevention and early intervention efforts in family, domestic and sexual violence. The pledge includes $104m over five years for the primary prevention organisation Our Watch, which will help it to drive change in the corporate sector and raise awareness about gendered violence. The minister for women, Marise Payne, said Our Watch would also develop safety programmes for use in Tafes, universities, the media, workplaces and sports organisations. “Our Watch will also boost its efforts in prevention for LGBTIQA+ Australians, Australians with disability and migrant women and develop further resources to educate young people about consent,” Payne said. The government will fund two new campaigns to run across mass media channels, including television, cinema, social media and bus stops. One of the campaigns will be adapted from Scotland’s “Don’t Be That Guy” initiative and will ask men to consider “how they can hold each other to account because sexual violence should not be considered a women’s problem to solve”. The other government-funded campaign will target young people 12 and older and their parents. The minister for women’s safety, Anne Ruston, said new research showed while almost nine in 10 Australians polled agreed “adults should talk to young people more about the topic of consent”, almost half of Australians were confused about the issue of sexual consent. That led them to actively avoid the topic. “Today we are also making the announcement to fund a survey of secondary school-age students so that we can understand what are the issues that they are confronted with as they make their journey through life and to make sure that they have a better understanding of consent,” Ruston said. The Australian Human Rights Commission will develop the survey in partnership with coalition member Contos, who is the founder of Teach Us Consent. Ruston said the government was committed to making Australia “a country where everybody lives free from fear of violence and free from violence”. Patty Kinnersly, the chief executive of Our Watch, said the organisation was seeing “record demand for our support and services in universities, workplaces and sporting clubs and organisations” and community sentiment was changing. “We are now talking about consent, we are now talking about violence against women being in the public domain, we are now giving people in the community to be bystanders and not let the sexist joke go past,” Kinnersly said.",News/Australia news,‘We will not be silent’: prominent women press Morrison government for violence and harassment reform,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/06/we-will-not-be-silent-prominent-women-press-morrison-government-for-violence-and-harassment-reform
3/6/2022,"The question My partner broke up with me after being together throughout the pandemic and, at the end, part of her reasoning was that she felt she “didn’t really know who I am”. I recently started seeing someone new and, although we’ve only known each other for a month, she said the same thing unprompted. Truthfully, I feel the same way about myself. I’m 30 and I’ve always felt subdued and unable to be expressive. I don’t know how to be authentically me. How do I find myself? I worry that I don’t have the right things to say and that girlfriends will either be bored by or put off by what I share, so I share as little as possible (not always, but it is my natural inclination). I also shy away from conflict. I’m not good at expressing myself and I think if I speak, I’ll only make things worse. Philippa’s answer I wonder if you feel that if you are yourself, you may put another person off. But if we never take the risk of putting the other person off, we never give ourselves the opportunity of letting ourselves be known. To be known we have to be seen. We will never be seen if we hide. To truly connect with others we need to be, not who we think we ought to be, but who we really are. You are worried about being boring. In my experience in the psychotherapy room and outside it, people are more likely to be boring when they are not taking the risk of being real. In other words, I want you to work on developing a tolerance for being vulnerable. One of the ways to increase wisdom and connection is to speak in the moment and work out things in conversation, rather than thinking we have to have everything right before we speak. This means not filtering all your thoughts: instead, say, “I love you,” or try to articulate other scary, self-revelatory thoughts without knowing how they are going to land. You can work out how you feel, not always on your own in your head, but in relationship with another. Say things spontaneously for the first time before you’ve thought them through. Practise being yourself and being unsure how you’ll be received. Dare to share. Is this a fail-safe formula? No. It is a risk. But without allowing ourselves to be really seen, a potential partner won’t be able to really connect with us. So, in my view, it’s a risk worth taking. In response to our earliest environment, we develop coping strategies and these become ingrained habits. What may have got you through early on – may have even earned you the appellation of “good boy!” – might have been “sharing as little as possible”. But what might have been a self-preserving policy in the past can become a self-defeating policy in the present. You say not sharing is your “natural inclination”. It could be just early adaptation, therefore ingrained rather than natural. Adapting to other people is a skill, and I suspect one you have in so much abundance that you might have lost some of yourself. Some people need to learn how to adapt and turn up the adaptation dial, while others – you seem to be among them – need to turn it down. If you adapt so completely to the other person, there is nothing left of you for them to have a relationship with. It is even hard for you to have a relationship with yourself. I expect you are putting in more energy to work out the other’s feelings than giving yourself attention to figure out your own. Perhaps conflict is difficult for you because you have difficulty in knowing what you feel. Conflicts are usually far more about how we each feel than they are about facts. There will be conflicts in any relationship as we all experience things differently. It’s better if we can think of differences, not so much as I’m right, they’re wrong, winning and losing, but as an opportunity to gain understanding of the other’s view point and to communicate how you feel about yours. Then, considering your and their feelings, work together for compromise. If conflict is completely avoided, not talked about, never aired, a relationship can shrink because, as subjects become taboo, it means there will be less and less to talk about and areas of loneliness creep in where each of you remain unseen. I’m wondering if you are numb where feelings are concerned. You don’t say how you feel about your break-up. Perhaps you learned to numb emotion because to have your feelings meant having pain. Trouble is, we cannot just numb hurt and pain without numbing joy as well. I think you need to work on turning up your feelings dial. You don’t have to go from zero to 10; try turning to a two or a three to start with. It will take practice. Your homework is to ask yourself several times a day – perhaps every time you go through a door – “What am I feeling?” Then from the answer work out what you want and then, ask for it, go for it. It’s time for you to experiment. Recommended reading Couch Fiction, a graphic novel about psychotherapy by, er, me, about a man who had to learn how to feel, available from guardianbookshop.com.

3/6/2022,"The world has watched in horror as Vladimir Putin has deployed the same tactics of indiscriminate slaughter of civilians in Ukraine as he did in Syria and Chechnya. The power of despots derives from their willingness to inflict unthinkable evil to bend the will of those they seek to dominate and Putin is no different. Ukrainians are locked into a mortal fight for their freedom and their liberty; the extraordinary bravery of its ordinary citizens should humble us all. Yesterday’s bellicose rhetoric from the Russian leader, including his threat to dismantle Ukraine’s statehood, offers no suggestion of compromise. His war crimes are intensifying. Over the past week, we have seen civilians targeted with mass shellings. Densely populated cities have been under constant bombardment for days, as people hide in basements with dwindling supplies of food and water. Hospitals and kindergartens have been destroyed by the bombs. Whole families trying to flee the carnage have been shot in cold blood by Russian soldiers. In Volnovakha, shells hit civilian buildings every five minutes from a line of contact 20km away; barely a building in the town has been left unscathed. Bodies have been left in the streets; the peril facing those carrying out rescue missions is so great that they have to prioritise the living. Just as he did in Syria, Putin has ordered that key cities such as Mariupol should be besieged. Just as he did in Syria, he appeared to make concessions for humanitarian corridors to be established from Mariupol and Volnovakha, to allow for the evacuation of civilians, only to rip up the terms of that ceasefire as soon as it had been agreed. Putin’s aim appears to be to break the morale of the Ukrainian people and to brutally terrorise them into surrender. There will be a time to go over the failings of the west that brought us to this dreadful point, where there seems to be no way for other democracies to avert a humanitarian crisis in Ukraine; all they can do is to try to lessen the toll. For now, the most important question is what we can do to support Ukrainians and their democratically elected leader, President Zelenskiy, in their fight and what we can do to limit the scale of the human catastrophe. There are actions the west can take that should not even be the subject of debate, yet on which the British government seems to be dragging its feet. Despite minor relaxations, the UK’s policy with respect to Ukrainian refugees remains far more restrictive than that of the EU. There are stories of families fleeing war who remain separated because of British bureaucracy and mean-spiritedness. This should be a source of national shame. Economic sanctions on Russian oligarchs may have limited direct effect on Putin on the short term. But there is no justification for not clamping down swiftly and hard: these are people who have profited directly from Putin’s regime. Yesterday, the Italian government seized yachts and villas worth at least €140m from four Russians on the EU sanctions list. The UK government’s sluggishness is likely to prove costly in terms of allowing individuals to escape the sanctions they must face. These are the easier questions to answer about what actions the west must take. Far harder is what Nato should do to support Ukrainian forces and minimise civilian casualties in Ukraine itself. Here, the UK has led the way on providing accurate intelligence and military supplies, but there is the ever-present question of what more there is to do. Nato cannot declare war on Russia, which is what a no-fly zone would amount to. This would be a reckless escalation of conflict with a nuclear power. But there are lessons the west must learn from Syria about effective military and humanitarian support in the face of Russian brutality. There must be more support for evacuating civilians, especially vulnerable adults and children, from cities not yet under siege. Cities should be flooded with humanitarian supplies and basic infrastructure, such as satellites and generators. Russian guarantees for humanitarian corridors cannot be relied upon. It is vital that war crimes are documented, not just in the interests of justice when the conflict is over, but to assist in negotiations for humanitarian access. Ukraine has reported that some of the anti-aircraft defence missiles it has received from Germany do not work, and has asked for more, a call that must be heeded. The bravery of the Ukrainian resistance will be remembered by generations to come: the people from all walks of life volunteering to defend their country; the unarmed protesters marching against their occupiers in Kherson, the only city the Russians have so far captured. Citizens of liberal democracies owe the people of Ukraine a debt of gratitude; they are at the frontline of the fight for freedom and democracy in the face of authoritarianism, for rights that most of us are complacent about. Russia’s strike on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station should serve as a reminder that they are more fragile than we would like to think. It is too early to know the consequences of the Russia-Ukraine conflict for the global order. China, guilty of genocide within its own borders, will be watching closely how Nato countries respond to the Russian threat. The people of Ukraine fight for their nation’s existence. What the US, Europe and the UK choose to do to support them could shape the course of history.",Opinion/Opinion,The Observer view on Ukraine and western support | Observer editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/06/observer-view-ukraine-western-support
3/6/2022,"The Heathcock, 58-60 Bridge Street, Cardiff CF5 2EN (029 2115 2290). Lunch £7-£13, mains (evenings) £15-£24, desserts £7-£8.90, wines from £19 On a slow news day in the summer of 2016, I became the subject of headlines for giving a Cardiff restaurant a good review. To be fair, it was less the nice things I said about the Classroom, which is staffed by catering students at Cardiff and Vale College, than my assertion that it was a boon to the Welsh capital because the city was short on great eating options. I’d liked both the Potted Pig and Purple Poppadom, basically anywhere beginning with the letter P, but after that, choice had seemed limited. Some people in Cardiff agreed with me. Others were aroused to a frothing digital rage. They sent me lists of terrific kebab, pizza and burger joints, all of which are marvellous things. You’ve got to love a city which boasts a street nicknamed Chippy Alley, for the number of establishments spanking the deep fat fryers. I was dismissed as an insufferable snob; a dreadful flaneur who was only interested in fancy-pants faine daining. Some said I was no longer welcome in the city. This peaked with Marco Pierre White announcing, during a press interview to promote the opening of his new Cardiff restaurant, that I specifically was not invited. Bless him. A man employed to distinguish between the execution of one pig’s head croquette over another really shouldn’t challenge a charge of insufferable snobbery. And yes, I can get as excitable over a bit of gastronomic ambition as the next over-entitled, expense-accounted keyboard jockey. But, in truth, the strength of a country’s food culture is not defined by a handful of gilded gastro-palaces, infested with espumas and granitas, and dripping with chandeliers like crystal tits, but by the presence of those places you’d keep going to repeatedly, because you just want something nice to eat. Happily, a number of interesting-looking restaurants of that sort have opened in Cardiff since my 2016 lunch: Asador 44, Sopra 73, Milkwood, North Star, Heaney’s and its sibling oyster bar Uisce, Thomas by Tom Simmons, Nook, and a few more. Then there’s the Heathcock, a reassuringly solid lump of a pub, located amid the tree-lined lanes of Llandaff to the city’s north, which is where I went, and where I would go again. It’s a second venture from the team behind the Hare & Hounds at Aberthin a few miles to the west of Cardiff. In its pleasingly straightforward approach to the business of feeding people well, it has a touch of St John about it. It feels as though the doctrine of chef Fergus Henderson has been read and fully understood – identify the good things, do them well – and then shaped for the space in which it finds itself. Both the main bar and the dining room next door are white, utilitarian spaces, as are those at St John in London’s Farringdon. Offal is embraced, as it is at St John. Ox heart makes a showing. So do pickled walnuts and duck fat. The bar menu offers a homemade sausage roll, which comes with their own brown sauce. It’s a bronzed, big-shouldered wonder of flaky pastry and dense, well-seasoned sausage meat. There are local ales on tap, including Grey Trees Drummer Boy from Aberdare and Bragdy Twt Lol Twti Ffrwti from Pontyprid. Any suggestion that I am merely copying out words at this point, and don’t have a clue what any of this means, is extremely scurrilous. The point is that the Heathcock is very much a pub which also has a dining room. For £4.20 you can get a three-strong ale flight, plus there’s a heavily French wine list, almost all of which is available by the glass, carafe and bottle. In the evenings the food menu follows a classic starter-main model. There’s lamb with Jerusalem artichokes and green sauce. There’s venison with button mushrooms, roasted beetroot and blackberries. Most of those mains cost around £20. But at lunchtime it’s a selection of small plates only rarely priced into double figures. Slices of cold roast beef, served soft and pink, come curled on a slab of duck fat toast, and topped with hefty fronds of peppery watercress with a big grating of fresh horseradish. More grated horseradish turns up with a silvery fillet of pickled mackerel, alongside a cucumber relish, that reminds me in a sweet, nostalgic way of the stuff in jars that I loved as a kid. Both elements rest on a lake of a sweet-sour blood orange dressing that is so good we ask for a spoon so it isn’t wasted. We have butter-yellow ribbons of pappardelle with a ragu made from rabbit leg that has been braised unto collapse then given a helpful boost from handfuls of chopped tarragon. For texture it is topped with golden fried breadcrumbs. There are slices of salmon pastrami, with a dry, dense texture and a spiced and brown sugared edge, that has me dabbing at the plate for any last crumbs of the massive flavour bomb of a rub left behind on the plate. Chunks of celeriac get the buttermilk fried chicken treatment and come with wild mushrooms and a purée of themselves. Dainty pieces of grilled ox heart arrive perched on what has been described as a duck fat chip. It turns out to be the same as the multi-layered, then deep-fried confit potato that we have ordered as a side. Having two portions of this on the table is no hardship. (Incidentally, I tried making these at home recently courtesy of a recipe from London’s Quality Chop House, which is credited with inventing them. While delicious, they are an enormous, 24-hour faff and should be left to restaurant kitchens.) Our other side dish is hispi cabbage which, in a radical departure, has not been chargrilled. It turns out you can just shred and butter hispi cabbage. Who knew? For a last classical flourish, the kitchen knocks out a perfectly engorged rhubarb soufflé tasting brightly of its star ingredient. There is also a wobbly and gently tart buttermilk pudding with honeycomb and leaves of sweet white chocolate. Even allowing for a pandemic-enforced gap, it’s taken me a while to get back to Cardiff. After a lunch like this I can’t fail but be delighted I’ve returned. Does the thoughtful and thoroughly satisfying cooking at the Heathcock mean I was wrong to be so down on the city’s possibilities back in 2016? No, it just suggests things have changed, and so very much for the better. A large and growing group of chefs and restaurateurs have come together to raise funds for Unicef’s relief work in Ukraine under the hashtag #CookForUkraine. The restaurants, including St John, Sabor, Blacklock and Soho House have so far raised more than £65,000, some by adding an extra charge to the bill, others by putting a Ukrainian themed dish or drink on the menu. The Ukrainian food writer and cook Olia Hercules, one of those behind the venture and whose family are still in the country, said: ‘I don’t want people to get stuck in the headlines and to lose sight of the human beings behind this story. And what’s more human than people getting together and sharing food?’ Restaurants wanting to get involved can email CookForUkraine@gmail.com. Home cooks are also being encouraged to stage fundraising supper clubs. Any donations can be made here. In other Cardiff news Lee Skeet, former head chef of Hedone in London, has more than achieved his crowdfunding goal of raising £25,000 to buy new kitchen equipment for his restaurant Cora in the Welsh capital. After a series of sold-out pop-ups, Cora opened in January. It serves tasting menus costing £50 at lunch and £75 at dinner, and seats just 12 guests. The crowdfunder actually raised over £28,000. The extra money will be invested in new staff and crockery. Elsewhere in Wales, the company behind the vast Celtic Manor Resort just outside Newport is to launch a new seafood restaurant in Milford Haven. Dulse, named after the edible seaweed, will be part of the Tŷ Hotel Milford Waterfront. It will open in April and promises ‘pure freshness from the Pembrokeshire coast and countryside’.

3/6/2022,"Andrew Rawnsley is right to note that Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine signals a global contest for the soul of our planet (“Liberal democracies must defend their values and show Putin that the west isn’t weak”, Comment). The current situation can be traced back to western triumphalism after the collapse of the Soviet Union, which may well have fed Putin’s drive to address perceived humiliation. The hubris of the west in turn fed strategic inertia and a failure to follow words with action, as in Barack Obama’s refusal to act when Bashar al-Assad crossed his red lines in Syria, when Joe Biden abjectly abandoned Afghanistan, and the UK prostituted itself by accepting foreign investment without any checks on where it came from, turning London into the world’s money-laundering capital. The wealth of a small global elite now holds sway over the planet, as noted by Nick Cohen. This in no way justifies Putin’s warmongering. However, I fear things will continue to get worse until and unless a new political leadership emerges that is willing and able to rebuild our economies on a more equitable and environmentally sustainable basis and make the options both electorally attractive and administratively feasible.Geoffrey PayneLondon W5 Would that our leaders might implement the punitive sanctions against Putin that Simon Tisdall suggests (“Timidity, greed and sloth: why the west always loses to Putin”, Focus). There are other actions that could be taken through the UN that might ease an earlier, still unresolved, refugee crisis for Europe for which Russia bears much responsibility. Putin’s preoccupation with Ukraine and the near-worldwide abhorrence of his actions provide the opportunity to make a major effort to reconvene Syrian peace talks without the previous stumbling block of Putin’s insistence that al-Assad remains in office. A peace agreement should be followed by UN-supervised elections and both Assad and Putin facing charges at the International Criminal Court.Professor Keith BarnhamFrome, Somerset The war in Ukraine is devastating and terrifying and Boris Johnson should not be allowed to use it for his career purposes (“From partygate to Putin’s war: PM rides on a rare wave of unity”, News). He may think of himself as a second Churchill, but it is up to the media to prevent this mistaken image from taking hold. It should be possible to find the newspaper contributions Johnson published in 2014, when Russia occupied Crimea. Was he writing about how to preserve peace and protect democracy in Europe? Or was he already plotting to destabilise the European Union? And ever since 2014, he has spent a lot of his (and everybody else’s) energy on creating disunity in the west, instead of the unity he is now suddenly praising. Johnson is no Churchill. He is still the lying opportunist he always has been.Aileen RambowLondon N10 Your leader article’s cynicism concerning Johnson’s promises to do anything about, let alone clean up, Russian dirty money (“Putin’s Russia is a pariah state. A united front must complete its isolation”, Editorial) is understandable. Inured by Johnson’s lying, Putin’s has been less surprising. It’s noticeable, though, that it’s taken some Ukrainians just a few days of the war before publicly questioning Johnson’s bona fides after he made his pledges, compared to the months or even years it has taken some in his own country to do the same.David MurrayWallington, Surrey Our use of Russian oil and gas is helping to fund Putin’s war machine. This affects the UK less than some European countries, but surely we and the EU can cooperate to cut back on Russian oil/gas imports, and accept some overnight power cuts as a result. It is our inconvenience against Ukrainian civilians being killed by the Russian military.Peter HenshawSherborne, Dorset Will Hutton describes the UK university system as a demand-led market (“Kicking universities is no way to solve the divide between the academic and the rest”, Comment). However, it is a perverse market. In a self-correcting functioning market, when the product yields diminishing satisfaction, demand falls, entrepreneurs reduce output and resources are transferred to more productive uses. However, education markets don’t work like this. Instead, when “consumers” (ie students) perceive that the “product” (ie access to sought-after job opportunities) no longer provides this benefit, demand does not diminish; instead, many students perceive the need for more, not less, education because otherwise they may face long-term unemployment. A-levels were once necessary for entry to many professions in the UK, then first degrees became essential, and recently those with masters and doctorates far outnumber the job opportunities they aspire to. Proposals for lowering the level of income at which student loans kick in, and extending repayments from 30 to 40 years, will reduce the amount of debt falling on taxpayers but this delays the need to rethink the future of university funding.Lawrence LockhartBath, Somerset Benjamin Zephaniah’s experiences are an inspiration to us all (“New rules will stop the likes of me going to uni – Zephaniah”, News). The government must be stopped in its proposals to bar any student who fails GCSE English or maths from securing higher educational loans. The fact a person has dyslexia shouldn’t inhibit their progress in life. My inabilities at school resulted in years of embarrassment when asked to stand up and read out a passage from our English books. It also led to years of questioning my ability to progress in life. It wasn’t until I entered university as a mature student that one of my lecturers, himself dyslexic, identified that I had a learning disability. It’s critical that the government develops new educational systems that benefit students with dyslexia and enhances their chances of reaching their goal of entering higher education.Stuart CarruthersLewes, East Sussex  ",News/From the Observer,The roots of Vladimir Putin’s invasion ambitions | Observer letters,https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2022/mar/06/letters-the-roots-of-vladimir-putins-invasion-ambitions
