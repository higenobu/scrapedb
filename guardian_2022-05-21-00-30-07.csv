5/21/2022,"The Greek composer Vangelis, who has died aged 79, always avoided becoming a trained, academic musician, and had an almost superstitious fear of analysing the nature of his gifts. “I don’t know how it happens,” he said. “I don’t try to know. It’s like riding a bicycle. If you think, ‘How am I going to do it?’ you fall down.” However he did it, he created a string of enduring and hugely varied works, ranging from pop and semi-classical compositions using a mixture of synthesisers, electronica and traditional instrumentation to some of the most memorable film scores in cinematic history. He became a pop star in his native Greece in the late 1960s with Aphrodite’s Child, zooming up European charts with their single Rain and Tears and playing to stadium-sized crowds, and formed a successful partnership with Jon Anderson, the vocalist with Yes. His solo albums covered countless musical bases, from classical and jazz to electronic and ambient. But the music that instantly springs to mind when his name is mentioned is his soundtrack for Chariots of Fire (1981), Hugh Hudson’s film about the 1924 Paris Olympics. It won Vangelis an Oscar, and its epic, soaring title theme has enjoyed an independent life ever since: for instance, featuring in medal ceremonies at the London 2012 Olympics. Equally significant was his score for Ridley Scott’s sci-fi masterpiece Blade Runner (1982). Vangelis created a stunning sonic panorama of the fragmented, alienated world that Scott depicted on the screen, where advances in technology were matched by the decay of human emotions. His music became almost like an extra character in the development of the story. Vangelis was born Evángelos Papathanassíou in the coastal town of Agria, Thessaly, and was brought up in Athens. His father, Odysseus, was in the property business, and was an enthusiastic amateur runner as well as a music lover. Vangelis began playing the piano and other instruments from the age of four, and his parents sent him for music lessons when he was six. However, he had no interest in learning to read or write music. “Music is not something that’s written,” he said. “Everything that’s noted down comes after the music is created … Music is immediate, wild, unpredictable, multidimensional.” Nonetheless he later took some piano lessons with the Greek composer Aristotelis Koundouroff. While at school, he began to play in bands, and in 1963 he joined Forminx (sometimes spelt Formynx), playing cover versions and some of his own compositions. At the time his stage name was Vagos. “It was just our idea of having fun,” he recalled, but Forminx became one of Greece’s best-known bands. They split in 1966, and Vangelis met Demis Roussos the following year. They formed the psychedelic pop outfit that would become Aphrodite’s Child. The group attempted to move to London but were not able to get any further than Paris, thanks to their lack of work permits and the chaotic events of May 1968 in France. They signed to Mercury Records and scored a major pan-European hit with their debut single Rain and Tears, which borrowed heavily from Pachelbel’s Canon in D Major. Aphrodite’s Child enjoyed further chart success, particularly with their 1970 single It’s Five O’Clock, but by the time they came to record their third album, 666, the group were beginning to suffer internal tensions. A progressive concept album devised by Vangelis, 666 was based on the Book of Revelation. His bandmates were not enthusiastic about this new direction and the members went their separate ways. Vangelis had begun composing film soundtracks as early as 1963 with My Brother, the Traffic Policeman, and he now pursued this line of work with scores for Sex Power (1970), Salut, Jerusalem (1972) and Amore (1974). He released his first solo album, Fais Que Ton Rêve Sois Plus Long Que la Nuit (Make Your Dream Last Longer Than the Night), in 1972 and a follow-up, Earth, in 1973. In 1974 he auditioned for the British prog-rockers Yes at the instigation of Anderson, but turned down the job after problems with work permits. In 1975 he moved to London and set up his own 16-track recording studio, Nemo. Signed to RCA, he released Heaven and Hell (featuring Anderson), and Albedo 0.39 (1976), based on the theme of astrophysics, which was his first Top 20 album in the UK (it included the much-covered track Pulstar). He followed up with Spiral (1977) and Beaubourg (1978). In 1979 he formed Jon and Vangelis with Anderson, who reached the UK Top 5 with their album Short Stories, the first of four they would make together. “Making music with Vangelis was always a simple pleasure, and then it became very successful,” said Anderson. “It was very spontaneous and very joyful.” By 1979 Vangelis had moved to Polydor, and his globe-trotting instincts were reflected in the albums China and Odes, the latter a collection of traditional Greek folk songs recorded with the Greek singer and actor Irene Papas. The pair collaborated again on Rapsodies (1986). Vangelis struck up another fruitful partnership with the wildlife documentary maker Frédéric Rossif. The first of his soundtracks for the director was L’Apocalypse des Animaux (1973), followed by La Fête Sauvage (1976) and Opéra Sauvage (1979). The last of these was one of Vangelis’s most successful releases in the US, lodging itself on the Billboard album chart for 39 weeks. Its combination of warm, accessible melodies and conventional instruments alongside a Yamaha CS-80 synthesiser helped bring Vangelis to the attention of mainstream film-makers (Peter Weir used music from it in The Year of Living Dangerously in 1982). It set the stage for Vangelis’s pivotal partnership with Hudson, whom he had first met in Paris in the early 70s, on Chariots of Fire. His theme for Chariots of Fire, mixing a formal classicism with the rhythmic and tonal possibilities of synthesisers and electronic percussion, reached No 12 in the UK and became a No 1 hit in the US in 1982, while the soundtrack album topped the Billboard chart. Vangelis, who played all the soundtrack instruments himself, won the 1982 Academy Award for best original score, and the fact that Chariots of Fire won the best picture Oscar probably owed much to the impact of Vangelis’s music. A reluctant traveller, Vangelis did not visit Hollywood to collect his award. “My main inspiration was definitely the story itself,” he reflected. “The rest I did instinctively, without thinking about anything else other than to express my feelings, using the technological means that were available at the time.” The film world became his oyster. His score for Costa-Gavras’s Missing (1982) won him the Palme d’Or at the Cannes film festival, and other notable works included scores for The Bounty (1984), Scott’s 1492: Conquest of Paradise (1992) – the soundtrack album would sell 4m copies – and Oliver Stone’s Alexander (2004). However, Vangelis was keen to avoid being trapped on a treadmill of soundtrack work. “The more successful that you become in any form of music, the more you become a product that generates a lot of money,” he observed. “Instead of being able to move freely and do whatever you wish, you find yourself stuck and obliged to repeat yourself and previous successes.” There seemed nowhere Vangelis could not go. His choral symphony Mythodea, which he performed in Athens in 2001 with the operatic sopranos Jessye Norman and Kathleen Battle, was adopted as the official music for Nasa’s Mars Odyssey space mission. In 2014 he composed three pieces for the European Space Agency’s Rosetta mission, and these appeared on his album Rosetta (2016). He even had an asteroid (no 6354) named after him by the Minor Planet Center of the International Astronomical Union. Fascinated by space exploration and science, he also composed a score for Stephen Hawking’s memorial at Westminster Abbey in 2018. His final studio album was Juno to Jupiter (2021), named after Nasa’s Juno spacecraft. Vangelis received the Max Steiner award in 1989, and in 1992 was made a Chevalier of the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (he was promoted to Commandeur in 2017). In 2003 Nasa awarded him its public service medal.

5/21/2022,"Stephen Colbert mocked an old target on Thursday evening: George W Bush, who gave a speech in Dallas on Wednesday for an event called “Elections – A More Perfect Union”, focused on how elections work. “And we’ve actually acquired Dubya’s powerpoint on how elections work,” the Late Show host deadpanned. “Step one: get fewer votes than your opponent. Step two: have the supreme court hand it to you.” But Colbert focused on one significant gaffe during the speech: when Bush said Russia’s undemocratic political system resulted in the “absence of checks and balances in Russia and the decision of one man to launch a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion of Iraq. I mean, of Ukraine.” Colbert gasped. “The one phrase he definitely should never utter for the rest of his life! It’s like he’s thinking of it all the time and it just popped out.” “Thankfully Dubya caught himself and did a quick course correct,” Colbert added – after the gaffe, Bush shrugged and added, “I mean, of Ukraine … Iraq too. Anyway – 75.” “Iraq too, heh? That is a refreshingly lighthearted confession to war crimes,” Colbert marveled. “I guess we should call off the search for WMDs at this point. Somebody owes Saddam Hussein an edible arrangement.” Bush accidentally admitting the invasion of Iraq was “wholly unjustified and brutal” left Seth Meyers aghast, as well. “I really am certain that clip was designed in a lab to melt the brains of anyone who was alive in 2003,” the Late Night host said. “Back then if you had called the invasion of Iraq brutal and unjustified, the Bush administration and Fox News would’ve spent an entire week calling you a traitor and anytime you went to the airport the TSA would’ve given you the full cavity search.” The gaffe was laughable, but “there is a direct line from Bush to the modern GOP,” he added. “The Trump Republican party is the natural evolution of the Bush Republican party, which was lawless and authoritarian and used culture war hysteria to stir up resentments and scare voters the same way the modern Republican party does now. “They’ve just switched topics. Back then, Bush wanted to amend the constitution to ban gay marriage. Now, Republicans want to take baby formula away from migrant children in government custody” amid a devastating nationwide shortage of baby formula. To quote Fox News host Jesse Watters: “why are we feeding illegal babies ahead of American babies?” “‘Illegal babies,’ are you out of your fucking mind?” Meyers responded. “As a rule, if you ever find yourself uttering the words ‘Why are we feeding illegal babies’ or even just the words ‘illegal babies’, that’s when you need to go in for a CAT scan to see if the doctors can find your soul.” And Samantha Bee returned to Full Frontal to address the leaked supreme court draft opinion that would overturn Roe v Wade, allowing over 20 states to ban abortion. Full Frontal was on hiatus when the leak was announced – “just a beautiful day to kick back, enjoy the sun, and burn our throats to dust with endless screaming,” she deadpanned. The 98-page opinion by justice Samuel Alito, while not official, is “basically a trailer for how fucking horrible life is to become for a lot of people,” Bee explained. Shec called the opinion “infuriating” not just for the rights it strips away but for Alito citing “shithead from the goddamn 17th century who defended marital rape and had women executed for witchcraft. Or, as more than half of the supreme court calls that: not far enough.” “And that’s not even the oldest weird shit Alito cites,” she continued. “His ass goes all the way back to abortion law in the 13th century.” She’s not a legal expert, Bee said, “but I think we can limit precedents that control human bodies to after the same century that Genghis Khan did his thing.” Given that the majority of Americans support abortion access, Bee said it was no surprise that people took to the streets in light of Roe’s likely demise, “and even less surprisingly, it took no time at all for conservatives to recast themselves as the real victims.” After playing a series of clips in which GOP figures such as Mitch McConnell, Sean Hannity and Marco Rubio call for civility, Bee interjected: “Pardon me, but in my civilest way possible, may I humbly request that you fuck the fuck off?!” “How dare Republicans demand civility as they strip away our civil rights,” she added. “When Susan Collins gets a sidewalk full of bubble letter chalk, she is not the victim. When Amy Coney Barrett’s tacky ass McMansion is visited by a back of roaming handmaids, she is not the victim.” The real victims, she continued, will be the people who live in the 26 states that will ban abortion if Roe v Wade is overturned, the people who could be prosecuted for providing a procedure, poor people and people of color who will “depressingly bear the greatest brunt of reproductive decisions made by men who, as best as I can tell, believe women lay eggs.” She consciously avoided ending on a note of despair, however, calling on viewers to fight for reproductive rights – “because if they’re taking away our right to choose, fighting is the only choice we have left”.",Arts/Culture,Stephen Colbert on Bush’s gaffe: ‘A refreshingly lighthearted confession to war crimes’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/may/20/stephen-colbert-george-w-bush-gaffe-late-night
5/21/2022,"Long before Partygate, Boris Johnson was known among colleagues for the superpower of survival: the extraordinary ability to shrug off setbacks that led his Eton contemporary, David Cameron, to liken him to a greased piglet. This weekend, as scores of junior colleagues reeled from the news that just one of the 126 fines levied over Partygate was levied on the prime minister, his supporters were celebrating what appeared to be another great escape. Shortly after finishing a call with the Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Thursday morning, what Johnson had long been telling friends was formally confirmed to No 10: he will receive no further fines, aside from the one he was handed for sharing a birthday cake with colleagues in June 2020. With a well-timed announcement of structural changes aimed at showing he has got a firmer grip on No 10, and the promise of action on the cost of living, Johnson now hopes to put the parties row behind him. He was back to his usual bumptious self in Friday’s speech to Welsh Conservatives, rattling through his greatest hits, from claiming he “got the big calls right” on Covid to attacking “Corbynistas” – though to a noticeably muted response from the audience. Earlier, he had told reporters during a factory visit that he could not “simply magic away” the cost of living crisis. He still has two more hurdles yet to surmount, however: the final report of the formidable Sue Gray, who has already told Johnson that she plans to name him; and an inquiry by the House of Commons privileges committee into whether he misled parliament. One Boris-sceptic backbencher suggested that while Gray’s report might solidify things in a few MPs’ minds, by setting out in black and white the unedifying details of the parties, it was unlikely to hit home with Johnson or his team. “I don’t know what Sue Gray’s report is going to say next week,” the MP said. “It won’t be pretty reading, and in any normal world I’m sure it will be devastating, but they’ll no doubt crack on regardless.” Some senior Tories regard the privileges committee investigation as the more dangerous of the two. “The privileges committee is the lethal one,” said one former cabinet minister. “The fundamental question is misleading the House, and whether it was deliberate or not. It seems to me very hard to argue that it wasn’t, because we now know he attended a number of parties. Either he’s very stupid or he’s very dishonest.” However, the makeup of the committee is still in flux, after Labour’s Chris Bryant recused himself, having already expressed a view about Johnson’s honesty, and with other members on the government payroll expected to be replaced. It could be many months before its findings see the light of day. Yet just as the parliamentary drama of Brexit subsided only to be overwhelmed by the Covid pandemic, Partygate is drawing to a messy conclusion just as Westminster – and the world outside – are being overwhelmed by the cost of living crisis. Conservative MPs are exasperated at what they see as Johnson and Rishi Sunak’s excessive caution over the devastating impact of 9% annual inflation, which is vividly on show in their constituency surgeries, their inboxes and at local charities and food banks. Bernard Jenkin, the liaison committee chair – who is neither a wet, nor a rebel – used his intervention in this week’s Queen’s speech debate to set out what he said was a £13.5bn package of measures to tackle the crisis. Against that background, consumer confidence in the UK has plunged to its lowest level since records began in 1974; and the latest YouGov tracker showed that 71% of voters think the government is managing the economy badly. Even in the immediate aftermath of Sunak’s spring statement, many were already of the view that, “he’ll have to do more”, as one “red waller” put it at the time. Since then, Sunak has moved from insisting that he would wait until the energy price cap is next uprated in October to saying that he “stands ready” to act. Keir Starmer sought to hammer home the costs of that delay at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, taunting Johnson that he was, “choosing to let people struggle when they don’t need to”. Labour strategists believe ultimately it will be the parlous state of the economy and the government’s failure to tackle it, that sweeps Johnson out of Downing Street. “We always felt that all the damage that has been done to him over the lies and the deflections and distortions around Partygate was money in the bank, before the real issue, which was always going to be the cost of living,” said one senior party figure. Both Labour and the LibDems are hoping to take one each of a pair of hard-fought byelections being held next month, in Wakefield and Tiverton. In the Devon seat vacated by Neil Parish, who resigned after admitting watching porn in the chamber of the House of Commons, the Lib Dems say they are starting to hear some of the same disillusionment among Tory voters they heard in Chesham and Amersham, the Buckinghamshire seat they won last June on a swing of 25 points. “The transformation of the Conservative party into Boris Johnson’s own image is unattractive to a lot of people who are lifelong, traditional Conservatives,” said a party source. Some MPs say they are increasingly picking up this disillusionment even among their own constituency associations, where party stalwarts who once flocked to Johnson’s side are now angry or even ashamed of their party leader. Judging by the gusto with which he addressed the Welsh party faithful on Friday, Johnson believes he can still win the grassroots back – and his MPs appear to have concluded for the moment, that in the absence of a clear alternative, they will stay their hand. But one veteran Tory insists that with the cost of living crisis worsening by the day, and Downing Street apparently paralysed with indecision, the danger for Johnson is far from over. “At the moment it’s bloody difficult to see who is going to be the prime minister. That’s a difficulty. But it’s not a final difficulty, because it will get to the point where people will think a gatepost would be better.”",News/Politics,Boris Johnson’s survival superpower can only last so long,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/20/boris-johnson-survival-superpower-last-tory-angry-partygate
5/21/2022,"Digest for a moment the words of Sir Charles Walker, a Tory MP once bent on toppling the prime minister, but no longer. “Love him or loathe him,” says the lapsed rebel, comparing his party leader to a cricket all-rounder who averts apparently certain defeat by taking five wickets and then smashing a century, “Boris Johnson is an extraordinary politician. He just rewrote the script.” There’s been quite a lot in that vein since the Metropolitan police announced that Johnson will face no further criminal sanctions, despite his running Downing Street like a student dorm while the rest of the country was locking down against a deadly virus. Even Johnson’s more sceptical colleagues have been putting on their “You’ve got to hand it to him” faces, marvelling that even as the police announced that No 10 was the venue for 126 breaches of the law committed by 83 people, the prime minister himself will face no more than the single fine he received last month for attending a birthday party in his honour. The talk among Conservatives – one part infuriation, two parts admiration – is that Johnson is once more the “greased piglet” of David Cameron’s memorable description, slipping out of the grasp of the perennially frustrated butcher who wants his head. But what is this supposed talent of Johnson’s exactly? Does this image, in fact, say less about the supposed agility of the prime minister than it does about the hamfistedness – or worse – of those who should be catching him? Could it be that Johnson’s political survival is only partly a function of his skill and owes rather more to the uselessness and cowardice of those who should have stopped him months, years or even decades ago? Start with the police, whose job is to investigate violations of the law. Recall that they did not do that in the case of Downing Street, that they only deigned to look into the matter after a legal challenge. Then consider the sheer strangeness of the decisions they announced on Thursday. As Adam Wagner, the leading authority on Covid law, puts it, the Met’s position amounts to a finding that Johnson “attended six illegal gatherings but attended five of them legally”. Other people – more junior people, unable to pay for top-drawer legal advice – have been fined for their presence at the very same events, so why not the prime minister? Fine legal brains have looked for small, technical loopholes that Johnson might just have slithered through, but there is a clearer explanation. Even though the police knew that Johnson attended six get-togethers, they only investigated two of them: the “ambushed-by-cake” birthday party and one other. By way of explanation, my colleague Vikram Dodd reports that the police only looked at cases where evidence was of the “slam-dunk” variety, which suggests they were only interested if there were photos. But that is odd. Why not just ask Johnson, via those notorious questionnaires, if he was present? As Wagner tells me: “The absolute best slam-dunk evidence is an admission.” But it seems Johnson was never asked. Recall that Johnson was telling people a month ago that his first fine would be his last – it seems the Met had kindly tipped him off – and you can see why people start talking of stitch-ups and the like. But you don’t have to resort to conspiracy theory. As Dodd writes, “the Met has painful experience of tangling with politicians and the powerful”: perhaps doing as little as possible seemed the safest course. In other words, the inaction of the police says less about Johnson’s talent for political escapology than it does about the Met’s timidity in the face of power. Which matters far more. Even so, to focus on the police is to miss the larger point. It suggests that the only standard that counts is the narrow, legal one: so long as you don’t get fined, you’re in the clear. There was a revealing exchange on this morning’s Today programme, when Dominic Raab – who is the, er, justice secretary – suggested that Johnson had shown “full accountability” by paying his fixed penalty notice. It had to be explained to Raab that handing over £50 hardly counts as being held accountable for presiding over a culture of serial lawbreaking in the very building that drew up the laws that bound the rest of us. Regardless of what the police did or didn’t do, that fact alone should have been enough for Raab, his fellow cabinet ministers and Tory MPs to have ejected Johnson long ago – and it should be still. They don’t need to wait for the final Sue Gray report. Redacted as it was, the update the senior civil servant gave in late January was sufficiently damning, identifying “a serious failure to observe not just the high standards expected of those working at the heart of government but also of the standards expected of the entire British population at the time” and “failures of leadership and judgment” in No 10. It wasn’t some astonishing act of political dexterity by Johnson that prevented Conservatives doing the right thing in the face of that interim verdict. It was their own lack of courage, their decision to put partisan self-preservation over the national interest, that saved him. And so it has been throughout his career. When Johnson destroyed Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s prospects of freedom, by recklessly telling a Commons committee she had been “simply teaching people journalism” in Iran, contradicting her insistence that she had been in the country on holiday, he should have been fired as foreign secretary. But Theresa May’s desire to keep the Brexiters on side stayed her hand. When he presided over corruption and incompetence as mayor of London, too many saw him as a route to power, or funding, to act. When he served up fictions as a correspondent in Brussels, designed to tickle the tummies of the Telegraph’s Euro-loathing readers, his editors indulged him. In each case, it was not some preternatural talent but the weakness of his colleagues and superiors that enabled him. The question now is whether Gray, in her imminent, final report, will follow the usual pattern and act as yet another of Johnson’s enablers or whether she will lay out the evidence that shows exactly who he is. If she follows the path of the police, Johnson’s past employers and the Conservative party, and lets him off the hook, then it will be left to the only people who might just have the stomach to do what is required: the voters.

5/21/2022,"A judge has found the University of Bristol liable for breaches of legal duties it owed to a vulnerable undergraduate who took her own life in what is being seen as a landmark decision. Natasha Abrahart’s parents have long argued that the university failed to make “reasonable” allowances for their daughter’s severe social anxiety. Abrahart, a 20-year-old physics undergraduate, was found dead at her flat in 2018, a day before she was to take part in a presentation to staff and students in a large lecture theatre. Robert and Margaret Abrahart sued Bristol under the Equalities Act for not taking reasonable care of their daughter’s “wellbeing, health and safety”, arguing that the university did not do enough to help despite staff knowing that Abrahart suffered from mental disabilities and was struggling with her studies. In a 46-page written judgment issued on Friday at Bristol county court, Judge Alex Ralton found that the university had breached its duties to make reasonable adjustments to the way it assessed Natasha; engaged in indirect disability discrimination against her; and treated Natasha unfavourably because of the consequences of her disability. He noted: “It was accepted by the medical experts that the primary stressor and cause of Natasha’s depressive illness was oral assessment.” The university was ordered to pay £50,000 to her parents. Speaking after the judgment was handed down, Robert Abrahart, a retired university lecturer, said: “Today, 1,481 days after Natasha took her own life on the day of an assessment she simply couldn’t do, after years of protestations from the university that it did all it could to support her, after having battled our way through an inquest and a civil trial, we finally have the truth: the University of Bristol broke the law and exposed our daughter to months of wholly unnecessary psychological trauma, as she watched her grades plummet, and her hopes for the future crumble before her eyes.” Margaret Abrahart, a retired psychological wellbeing practitioner, said: “We really hope that the University of Bristol will finally take its head out of the sand and recognise that now is the time for change. “We are ready to work with them to help ensure that the failings which led to Natasha’s death aren’t repeated so other families don’t have to suffer as we have suffered. We hope they will apologise for the role they played in Natasha’s death and will take us up on our offer of help.” Gus Silverman, a public law and human rights specialist at Irwin Mitchell, representing the family, said: “This judgment should serve as a wake-up call to all higher education institutions. They have to ensure that they understand and comply with their duties under the Equality Act. “This means not assessing disabled students, including those disabled by mental illnesses, in the same way as students who don’t share their disability if such assessments put those students at a substantial disadvantage, unless there is a very good reason for doing so. “This isn’t about giving disabled students an unfair advantage over their peers; it’s about levelling the playing field so that everyone has a chance to succeed. As Natasha’s case tragically illustrates, breaching the Equality Act is not only unlawful, it can also be fatal.” Abrahart was one of 11 University of Bristol students to kill themselves between 2016 and 2018. A University of Bristol spokesperson said: “Our whole university community has been deeply affected by Natasha’s tragic death and we would once again like to extend our sympathies to her friends and family. “We believe staff in the school of physics worked incredibly hard and diligently to support Natasha during her time with us, and it was due to their efforts that she was receiving specialist mental health support from the NHS. Our staff’s efforts also included offering alternative options for Natasha’s assessments to alleviate the anxiety she faced about presenting her laboratory findings to her peers. We are very grateful to them for their endeavours on Natasha’s behalf and for their unwavering commitment to our students. “We cannot replicate the NHS but are committed to working with the NHS and other partners to improve services and ensure we are collectively providing the best possible support for students. “Given the significant impact this decision could have on how all higher education providers support their students, we are reviewing the decision carefully, including whether to appeal.”  In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

5/21/2022,"Rising temperatures driven by the climate crisis are cutting the sleep of people across the world, the largest study to date has found. Good sleep is critical to health and wellbeing. But global heating is increasing night-time temperatures, even faster than in the day, making it harder to sleep. The analysis revealed that the average global citizen is already losing 44 hours of sleep a year, leading to 11 nights with less than seven hours’ sleep, a standard benchmark of sufficient sleep. Lost sleep will increase further as the planet continues to heat but it affects some groups much more than others. The sleep loss per degree of warming is about a quarter higher for women than men, twice as high for those over 65 years old and three times higher for those in less affluent nations. The researchers used data from sleep-tracking wristbands used by 47,000 people over 7 million nights and across 68 countries. Previous studies have shown that rising temperatures damage health, including increased heart attacks, suicides and mental health crises, and accidents and injuries, as well as reducing the ability to work. Poor sleep has also been shown to have these effects and the researchers said their study suggests that disturbed sleep may be a key mechanism by which heat causes these health impacts. Worryingly, the researchers said, their data showed no signs of people being able to adapt to hotter nights. “For most of us, sleep is a very familiar part of our daily routine; we spend nearly a third of our lives asleep,” said Kelton Minor, at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, and who led the research. “But growing numbers of people in many countries around the world do not sleep enough.” “In this study, we provide the first planetary-scale evidence that warmer than average temperatures erode human sleep,” he said. “It might actually be the tip of the iceberg, because it’s very likely our estimates are conservative.” Minor said sleep reduced by warmer nights is affecting huge populations. For example, he said, a night above 25C in a city of a million people would result in 46,000 extra people suffering from shorter sleep. “And if you look at the heatwave that’s transpiring right now in India and Pakistan, we’re talking about billions of individuals exposed to conditions expected to result in considerable sleep loss,” Minor said. The study, published in the journal One Earth, analysed sleep and outdoor weather data collected from 2015 to 2017 and found that higher temperatures reduced sleep by delaying its onset. People’s bodies need to cool every night as they fall asleep, but this is harder when it is warmer. Women may be affected more because their bodies usually cool faster than men’s when going to sleep. Women also have higher levels of subcutaneous fat on average, making cooling slower. Older people are known to sleep less at night and have poorer body temperature regulation, which may explain their susceptibility. People in poorer nations could lose more sleep as they have less access to cooling features such as window shutters, fans and air conditioning. The researchers found the impact of warmer nights on sleep was seen in all countries, whether they had naturally cooler or warmer climates, with the impact clear when night-time temperatures rose above 10C. “Worryingly, we also found evidence that people already living in warmer climates experienced greater sleep erosion per degree of temperature rise,” said Minor. “We had expected those individuals to be better adapted.” Furthermore, people did not catch up on missed sleep at later times, according to the data. Minor said the research had important implications for policymakers, who needed to ensure cities, towns and buildings were well adapted to heat in order to reduce the health impacts of rising temperatures. The UK government’s official advisers warned in 2021 that it was failing to protect people from the fast-rising risks of the climate crisis, particularly heatwaves. The data used in the study came mainly from richer nations, although it included some from India, China, Colombia and South Africa. The wristbands also tended to be worn by people less prone to sleep disturbance by warmer temperatures, such as middle-aged, wealthier men. “Lower-income people are underrepresented in the data and we’re very transparent about that,” said Minor. He said further research was needed, particularly in places that already ranked as among the hottest in the world, such as large parts of Africa, Central America and the Middle East. The research was unable to assess sleep quality, such as the different phases of sleep, but there was no change in the number of times people woke in the night. Minor said the path the world chose in terms of how hot the planet got wouls have consequences for everyone’s slumber. “Our decisions, collectively as societies, will have costs in terms of sleep.”",News/Environment,"Global heating is cutting sleep across the world, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/20/global-heating-cutting-sleep-study-health-impacts
5/21/2022,"The end of the season is the most emotional time in the footballing year. It’s when teams lift trophies and escape the drop and when fans give a salute to their heroes, with the Premier League promising to come to a spectacular conclusion in the last round of fixtures on Sunday. But in 2022 the season’s climax has seen emotion turn to disorder, once more causing disquiet at all levels of the game. Pitch invasions by supporters have caused trouble at Nottingham Forest, Northampton, Everton and Port Vale this week, as playoff fixtures and relegation matches ended with players being targeted by fans. On Thursday Robert Biggs, a 30-year-old Forest season-ticket holder, was jailed for 24 weeks for running on to the pitch and head-butting Sheffield United’s Billy Sharp. That same night there was a pitch invasion at Goodison Park after Everton’s dramatic 3-2 win over Crystal Palace that staved off the threat of relegation from the Premier League. The Palace manager, Patrick Vieira, was involved in a confrontation with an Everton fan where Vieira appeared to aim a kick at a man taunting him. The Football Association and Merseyside police said separately they were looking into the incident. Meanwhile the government threatened five-year bans on fans convicted of selling or taking class A drugs, as Boris Johnson said “middle-class cokeheads” were driving crime across the country. The Manchester University academic Geoff Pearson, a leading voice on fan culture and crowd safety, has argued that a “carnival” culture among some fans has been exacerbated by the absences from stadiums caused by the pandemic. But he also says behaviours have been unlearned during that time and punishments of the like imposed on Biggs are necessary to turn the tide. “There is an accountability issue,” he says, “and it takes time to correct that behaviour. But if you look back to the 80s people said hooliganism was intractable and between 1988 and 1994 we got a grip of it quite quickly. We’re now in a much better place than then and police already have the tools they need. But ultimately it is fans who will start to re-establish boundaries and that will be enforced by people being banned.” Football authorities are clear, too, that the legal framework exists to get the current problems under control. As a statement on pitch invasions from the Professional Footballers’ Association put it: “These are predictable events, it is a criminal offence, and it is unacceptable.” But the FA, English Football League and Premier League have begun new rounds of discussions over how to deal with the post-Covid rise in disorder. This week the EFL said it would support the use of measures to enforce “capacity reduction” on clubs whose fans invade the field or engage in other prohibited behaviour. Reductions could mean blocks of support being closed off, targeting areas perceived as being home to troublemakers. It could also, however, simply mean restricting fans from sitting in the first 10 rows of any stand and netting them off, so as to stop incursions physically. Other ideas being discussed include a focus on stewarding. An absence of neon tabards around football pitches has raised eyebrows among some observers, with calls for clubs to spend more money on stewarding. Pearson dismisses this as a practical solution. “You can’t stop home fans getting on the pitch with policing,” he says. But he argues that improving intelligence about crowds among police and stewards is crucial. One of the proposals being discussed by authorities is to take stewards from visiting clubs on away fixtures, the better to apply informed crowd control. Football’s stakeholders say their top priority is protecting the safety of those playing or coaching the game, and that their willingness to consider all corrective measures is a sign of how seriously they take the current problem. On this, they are in line with the police. England’s most senior footballing officer, chief constable Mark Roberts, said he was “alarmed” by the new spate of incidents. “Fans entering the pitch … [have] at times resulted in assaults and altercations with players, managers and club staff – which is totally unacceptable,” Roberts said. “The pitch is the players’ place of work and like everyone else, they should be able to feel safe. It is the responsibility of clubs to ensure that fans can view matches in safety and we will continue to work with clubs to see what can be done to help prevent these incidents in future.”",Sport/Football,Authorities searching for solutions after pitch invasions cause disquiet,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/20/authorities-searching-for-solutions-after-pitch-invasions-cause-disquiet
5/21/2022,"Flicking through a magazine one day in 1983, Jerry Bruckheimer found himself transfixed by a photo. “It was a picture of this helmet with a visor down and a plane reflected in the visor, and then two airplanes beside the helmet, and the guy’s in a cockpit,” the Hollywood producer later recalled. Three years later, the movie pitch that Bruckheimer dreamed up in that moment – “Star Wars on Earth” – became Top Gun, a blockbuster that grossed $350m from a $15m budget, sent Berlin’s Take My Breath Away to No 1 in six countries, turned a young Tom Cruise into the biggest movie star in the world, and made Ray-Ban’s Aviator sunglasses into a bulletproof summer style icon. But, while the Star Wars franchise has racked up 12 films, it has taken 36 years for Top Gun: Maverick to bring back the cocksure grin and leather flying jacket of Pete “Maverick” Mitchell. Can Top Gun – an American high-school movie in military uniform, a western with fighter jets instead of horses, a film that has been dubbed “an infomercial for America” – charm the world in 2022? With its high-fives and Budweisers, motorbikes and power ballads, Top Gun offers a nostalgic vision of the 1980s at a time of deep anxiety. Indeed, an appeal to a simpler, more wholesome past played a part in the popularity of the original film. Cruise in his James Dean-esque white T-shirt, McGillis with a baby pink sweater tied around her shoulders, the starchy whites of the military uniforms – these were all riffs on 50s iconography designed to beguile an 80s audience with their apple-pie wholesomeness. Top Gun never positioned itself as a fashion film – unlike on the set of 1980s American Gigolo, Giorgio Armani was not on speed dial – but its jumpsuits, leather jackets and mirrored shades are indelibly inked into our pop-cultural memory. Costume supervisors Bobbie Read and James W Tyson chose Aviator shades for factual accuracy, the style having been commissioned by the US military as eye protection for pilots since the 1930s. A consistent bestseller since 1986, the style currently enjoys White House patronage as Joe Biden’s signature look. The backers of Top Gun: Maverick will be hoping such longevity is a good omen. The leather flying jacket worn by Tom Cruise in the original was a centrepiece in a 2020 auction of film memorabilia that also included the thigh-high boots worn by Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman and the lightsaber used by Ewan MacGregor in Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith. A replica appears to have been made for the sequel, with an early trailer for the new film lingering on a close up of Cruise shrugging on the iconic Navy G1 bomber, in tanned goatskin with a sheep wool collar and stars-and-stripes embroidery. The olive-green boilersuits worn for flying, and the tobacco camp-collar shirts for downtime, are reprised. As Charlie Blackmore, Kelly McGillis’s wardrobe may not have had the knockout punch of Cruise’s but it offered an understated elegance that has stood the test of time. Stills of McGillis teaching class in an oversized white T-shirt with an unstructured dove-grey blazer, or teaming a streamlined version of the leather bomber jacket with a white shirt, dark pencil skirt and red lipstick are still spotted on fashion designers’ backstage moodboards as an icon of grown-up chic. Monica Barbaro, who plays a fighter pilot in the new film, is seen in the trailer playing sports in a crop top – a nod to the iconic beach volleyball scene of the original. The biggest gamble of Top Gun: Maverick is not whether audiences are still charmed by Cruise, but whether they can still be tempted back into cinemas. As Maverick straps himself in and takes to the skies, a lot is riding on it.",Arts/Film,A question of style: will Top Gun’s apple-pie nostalgia work its magic in 2022? | Jess Cartner-Morley,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/20/a-question-of-style-will-top-guns-apple-pie-nostalgia-work-its-magic-in-2022
5/21/2022,"There’s usually naff all to play for on the last Friday before the Premier League season ends, which means we can phone our Fiver in from the pub. But not this year. Annoyingly, our fierce thirst has had to wait while we work out what in Weird Uncle Fiver’s name is going on. First up: congratulations to Frank Lampard’s Everton. They won the Not Getting Relegated Cup for their third time in Premier League history by beating Crystal Palace 3-2 amid proper scenes at Goodison Park. So at least that’s done and dusted. There were touching moments at the end when fans who had effed and jeffed at players all season, ran on to the pitch in their thousands to hug it out. “Love you really, la.” If The Fiver had a glass eye, etc and so on. If the blue smog over L4 ever lifts, FL’s Everton will be able to hop on the bus down to Arsenal to take on the Big Cup-bottling Gunners. It says here that Mikel Arteta’s side need to beat the Blues – who could have Speedo Mick up front after a tremendous on-pitch performance – and hope that Spurs lose at Norwich. Yeah, Norwich, who have been the tormented ghost in the Premier League’s basement for the best part of six months. Surely, surely, not even an atomic bout of Spursiness will make that scenario happen. So congratulations Tottenham Hotspur. Enjoy Big Cup next season! What next? Ah yes, the last relegation place. Burnley’s draw with Aston Villa put survival firmly back in their own hands. If the Clarets beat Newcastle then no matter what Leeds do against Brentford, they will stay up because they have a better goal difference. But let’s be honest, they’re not going to beat the Saudi-fuelled Toon, are they? We fully expect former Claret Chris Wood to bring the pain. The good news for Burnley, though, is that Leeds have all but run out of players for their do-or-die clash. Congratulations Burnley, another season of being last on Match of the Day awaits! Now to the big one: the race to avoid Tin Pot. Eric ten Hag is so worried about having to bother reading the instructions for Uefa’s newest competition that he cut short his Caribbean holiday. He’s hoping his glowering presence at Crystal Palace can inspire Manchester United to the giddy heights of avoiding seventh. The last we saw of Palace, they were still on the Goodison Park pitch, where Patrick Vieira was appearing to put on an impromptu karate display. So congratulations Manchester United! Enjoy your Big Vase adventure next season. West Ham, currently in Tin Pot-securing seventh, are at Brighton, where there’s a beach we fully expect the tired Hammers to make a beeline for. We might get to the boozer faster than we thought, you know. So that just leaves the Premier League title to play for. All the talk is of $tevie Mbe’s Operation Etihad Exercise, because for Liverpool to win a 20th title they require Aston Villa to beat Manchester City while winning against Wolves at home themselves. He did his best for his beloved Liverpool by resting both Philippe Coutinho and Danny Ings for a large part of the drab home draw with Burnley, but since the Abu Dhabi-led takeover, City have beaten Villa by an aggregate score of 62-19. Congrats, Pep! Enjoy your champagne. We’re off for a pint. 8 May: “I will still be Borussia Dortmund’s head coach next season and I’m really looking forward to it, because I have a very good relationship with my team and want to get things off the ground” – a bullish Marco Rose on his future with BVB. 20 May: “Following an intensive season analysis … the club has decided to move forward, and wishes Marco Rose the best of luck in his next opportunity” – Dortmund are, shall we say, less effusive about his prospects. “Fresh from The Pope’s O’Rangers’ penalty faux pas fiasco (yesterday’s Quote of the Day), one-man physiotherapy industry botherer, Aaron Ramsey, is finding his heralded arrival as ‘the best signing in Scottish football since Paul Gascoigne’ coming under scrutiny by the media in the north. Tune in next week as they seek to investigate the club loyalty of Nicolas Anelka, Phil Jones’s prospects of an England call-up for Qatar, and if Daniel Farke ‘just needed more time’ to steady the ship at Norwich” – Johnny Connelly. “Re: Divock Origi doing one from Liverpool (yesterday’s Fiver letters). It certainly seems that Milan have spent the past four years or so hoovering up some of the most clutch strikers in the Premier League (if Ibra did have a spell across the pond in between). Pazza Inter indeed” – Harriet Osborn. “It’s easy to poke fun at soon-to-retire referee Mike Dean just because he used to slaughter chickens (yesterday’s Still Want More?). But have some respect. Whistlin’ Mike devoted years of his life to deciding the fate of bird-brained creatures that strutted about and preened themselves until losing their heads and ending up in the middle of the table” – Mark McFadden.

Spurs boss Antonio Conte insists there’s not been another 2006-style lasagna going round the camp, even though Harry Kane has been feeling rough. “Harry doesn’t want to miss this type of game, it means a lot for the club,” he roared. More pitch invasion bother has left Swindon boss Ben Garner feeling properly funky after their shoot-out defeat at Port Vale cost them a League Two playoff final spot. “What they have had to put up with coming off that pitch … players have been physically and verbally abused,” he sniffed. “I don’t know where we’re going as a country – it’s absolutely disgusting.” And Adebayo Akinfenwa will play one last game before hanging up his boots when Wycombe bid to upset Sunderland in Saturday’s League One playoff final. “At Wembley I’ve got to put him on, haven’t I?” riffed Gareth Ainsworth. “He’s not going to start and he probably knows that. But I wouldn’t like to be the gaffer who didn’t put him on for his last game, at the home of football.” Vivianne Miedema isn’t leaving Arsenal after all. She tells Bart Vlietstra why.

5/21/2022,"The official ratings suggest that Winter Power, last season’s Nunthorpe Stakes winner, has at least 9lb in hand of her 11 rivals in Saturday’s Temple Stakes at Haydock, but Tim Easterby’s filly disappointed twice after her Group One success and will need to be back to something like her best to win this well-contested Group Two. There were no obvious excuses for either of those poor runs and though Winter Power won first time up in 2021, a price of around 13-8 seems very short in the circumstances. Half a dozen opponents could take advantage if the favourite is below her best, including Came From The Dark, Twilight Calls, King’s Lynn and Last Crusader, but the horse that seems to have crept in almost unnoticed at around 12-1 is Stuart Williams’s Existent (3.45). The four-year-old was much improved on the all-weather over the winter and stepped up another notch when finishing strongly to take second in the Palace House Stakes at Newmarket last month. That was a well-run Group Three and on that form, Existent should not be twice the price of Twilight Calls, who was a length behind him in fifth. Haydock 1.25: Songo put up a career-best when returning to the Flat at Bath earlier this month and has an obvious chance to follow up from a 5lb higher mark. Goodwood 1.45: River Pride looks much improved this season and can underline the point here, having run into a rival with a similarly progressive profile when second at Newmarket last time. Haydock 2.00: A fascinating stayers’ handicap and Goobinator, fourth in the Cesarewitch last season and hurdling since, could still have some scope for improvement on the Flat. Goodwood 2.15: Lightly raced six-year-old West End Charmer was third in a Royal Ascot handicap two runs ago and has a solid chance in this Listed contest on that form. Haydock 2.35: Dirtyoldtown improved on his first start for Grant Tuer in April and could get an easy time of it up front. York 2.55: A typically competitive Knavesmire sprint handicap but Night On Earth ran well at Chester’s May meeting and the excellent Harry Davies keeps the ride. Goodwood: 1.10 Baccarat Baby, 1.45 River Pride, 2.15 West End Charmer, 2.50 Oman, 3.25 Calling The Wind, 4.00 Speak, 4.35 Sir Henry Cotton.  Haydock: 1.25 Songo, 2.00 Goobinator, 2.35 Dirtyoldtown (nb), 3.10 El Caballo, 3.45 Existent, 4.20 Gidwa, 4.55 Earls.

Haydock 3.10: Karl Burke has a strong hand of three-year-old sprinters and El Caballo can extend his winning streak to six here. The Curragh 3.20: Native Trail surrendered his unbeaten record in the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket but was drawn wide and away from the pace and still ran a fine race to finish third. A repeat of that form in the Irish equivalent should be enough to get a Classic success on to his CV.

5/21/2022,"A new film set in 1980s New York, in which Donald Trump’s property mogul father, Fred, and high-achieving lawyer sister Maryanne appear as characters is a direct attack on late-stage capitalism, according to its principal cast and director. Armageddon Time, which is premiering at the Cannes film festival and stars Succession’s Jeremy Strong alongside Oscar-winner Jessica Chastain as Maryanne Trump, in a cameo, is set during the run-up to the election of Ronald Reagan as president and examines the layers of privilege that determine the future of children attending different schools in the same city. Its writer-director, James Gray, said: “I think we are in serious trouble. History is very complex, but there are inflection points every few years and this moment in the 1980s was one of them. “Those children at the private school are going to run everything and they know it,” said Gray. “There is something ossified about a system that keeps the same people at the top. Why don’t we look at this system that requires a level of oppression to operate? I was trying to show the layers of that system and of that idea of privilege.” Strong, who plays aspiring global magnate Kendall Roy in Succession, said it was possible to “find the genome” for “terminal decadence in the United States” in the film. “You can find a thread connecting these two worlds,” said the actor, who plays a version of Gray’s angry, working-class father in Armageddon Time. “Succession didn’t exist for me while I was in the world of this film, but it is true that the fault lines that we see beginning to crack in this story have widened and become the political and social divisions that we see now.” While Armageddon Time focuses chiefly on the hopes of members of a struggling Jewish family, the broader story depicts the period of American politics that Gray believes has led to the racism, inequality and confused morality of today. The director was 12 at the time his film is set. As a fan of Muhammad Ali and the Beatles, the election of Reagan in 1980 came in the same period as a boxing ring defeat for Ali to Leon Spinks, the shooting of John Lennon in Manhattan and the renewed threat of nuclear conflict. The birth of the dominance of the market economy, coupled with the end of the adventurous “new Hollywood” films that Gray loves, did not help either, he said. “How did we get here?” the director wondered. “With everything owned by two people and a bunch of authoritarians who are trying to take over the planet? Children today don’t even understand the phrase ‘a sell-out’, they think it just means there are no tickets left.” He bemoaned the importance of film franchises in the entertainment industry and spoke of the enduring influence of white privilege in America, although he said he wrote the script of Armageddon Time before the death of George Floyd and the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement. Young actor Jaylin Webb plays a poor black schoolboy in the film, a character with no resources to call upon when he is confronted with prejudice and disadvantage. “Luckily I never got to experience what Johnny got to experience growing up,” he said. Anne Hathaway, who plays Esther Graff, a character based on Gray’s own mother, said she had been inspired by her own late mother-in-law’s warmth when creating her portrayal. “Who wouldn’t be honoured to play a Jewish mother?” the actor said, holding back tears. “My husband is Jewish. We talked about what it would mean for our family to take this role.” Gray said an old friend had recently advised him not to read newspapers or watch the news if he wanted to improve his mood, but said this was not an option for him. “Things do weigh upon me,” he said, “but if you are a creative person you can’t divorce yourself from the world. I have no idea how to solve issues of inequality, so you have to put it out in front of the audience. I don’t think it is my job to have an answer. As artists, we are here to pose questions.”",Arts/Film,"Armageddon Time: film featuring Trump family is attack on capitalism, says maker",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/20/armageddon-time-film-james-gray-trump

5/21/2022,"Dozens of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees who have been detained for more than seven months in a military base on an overseas territory claimed by Britain have gone on hunger strike in despair at their plight. The 42 hunger strikers are part of a group of 89 Sri Lankans, including 20 children, whose boat was intercepted and escorted to Diego Garcia in the middle of the Indian Ocean by the British military after running into distress while apparently headed to Canada from India in October. Diego Garcia is part of the Chagos Islands, which a UN court has ruled were unlawfully detached from Mauritius by the UK when it granted Mauritius independence in 1968. The UK, which calls the archipelago British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) has refused to cede sovereignty over the islands. The UK law firm Leigh Day, which is representing 81 of the Sri Lankans, says since their arrival on Diego Garcia, which is home to a US military base, the group have had very limited contact with the outside world and for the first six weeks were held without being able to communicate with anyone. They are being kept in a tented compound away from the island facilities and are understood to have made clear to the authorities that they are seeking international protection but no steps appear to have been taken to allow individuals to claim asylum. Leigh Day has written three letters to the foreign secretary and BIOT commissioner saying that returning the group to Sri Lanka could put them at risk of serious harm and be incompatible with the UK’s obligations under domestic and international law. It further says that refusing to allow them to communicate regularly with the outside world, including family members and their legal team, is unlawful. The latest letter, sent this week, says: “Our clients feel increasingly desperate at the conditions they are enduring on Diego Garcia and the lack of any apparent progress towards finding a solution for them. They have been given no information about how, when or where they will be afforded the opportunity to claim international protection, how long they are to be kept on the island, where they might be sent, and/or when (if ever) their conditions might improve. “We remind you that the group includes victims of torture and 20 children, many of whom are under the age of 10. The mental state of many of our clients can best be described as utterly despairing.” The letter says that such is the state of mind of its clients that they have asked what what the UK government will do in the event of their deaths on the island, with some requesting that should they die their organs should be donated to the British people. Sri Lanka’s civil war ended with the defeat of the militant Tamil separatist group, widely known as the Tamil Tigers, in 2009. But human rights organisations and the UN have reported an escalation of the harassment, surveillance and arbitrary detentions of – and land seizures from – Tamils over the past two years. The Leigh Day partner Tessa Gregory said: “It cannot be right for the UK government to leave this vulnerable group, which includes victims of torture and 20 children, stranded with limited access to communication, no education and without an opportunity to seek international protection. “Understandably the group are getting increasingly desperate and we have serious concerns for their mental and physical wellbeing. Immediate action is needed to ensure that a durable solution is found without any further delay.” The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office has been contacted for comment.",News/World news,Tamil refugees detained by UK on Chagos Islands go on hunger strike,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/20/tamil-refugees-detained-by-uk-on-chagos-islands-go-on-hunger-strike
