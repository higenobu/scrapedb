5/13/2022,"The government has given itself an “alarming loophole” to avoid protecting seabirds including puffins and gannets, a leaked document shows. Campaigners have accused ministers of “giving up” on the UK’s seabirds as they plan to apply for an exemption to a legal duty to protect the rare species. Each year the government sets itself targets to protect the marine environment and the wildlife within it, and one of those goals is to halt seabird decline. Of the UK’s 25 breeding seabird species, 24 are assigned red or amber status on the birds of conservation concern list, meaning they are at risk of local extinction. The UK marine strategy, seen by the Guardian, indicates that the government has shown signs that it intends to apply for exceptions to its legal duty to protect seabirds. The strategy, first published in 2012, imposed a legal duty on the government to meet 15 measures to achieve “good environmental status” by 2020. One of the targets was to halt seabird decline. So far the UK has failed to meet 11 of those targets, with progress towards the goal of halting seabird decline worsening from the 2012 starting point. Seabird numbers in the UK and have fallen almost 25% in less than four decades – a loss of more than 2 million seabirds compared with 1986. Things are at their worst in Scotland where population numbers have almost halved in this time. Reasons for seabird decline include the fishing industry hoovering up the sandeels and other small fish they like to eat, invasive species being introduced to the islands on which they breed, and birds being caught accidentally by fishing trawlers. The UK contains globally important populations of seabirds including puffins, kittiwakes and razorbills. Seabirds are also a key indicator of the health of the seas and coastal environment. Katie-Jo Luxton, the RSPB’s director for conservation, said: “We know that targets and deadlines alone will not see seabird numbers increase, but they are important in setting out the ambition of what our governments need to achieve in order to halt seabird declines. So we are urging governments to reconsider this decision to give themselves a loophole that could mean taking urgent action to save seabirds ceases to be a priority. “If our politicians are to live up to their promises of restoring wildlife then we need to see this reflected in the decisions and actions they take now. If the intention of the UK marine strategy is to restore our seas before it is too late, questions must be asked about why our governments are seeking not to be held accountable for failing to achieve the seabirds indicator. “With the UK aiming to play a leading role in the [Convention on Biological Diversity] Cop to restore wildlife, why is it sending a message that it is giving up on the UK’s seabirds?” A Defra spokesperson said: “The UK government is a global leader when it comes to protecting our seas, and we continue to work on increasing protections for our iconic seabird populations. We have set up an extensive network of special protection areas for seabirds, and are developing an ambitious seabird conservation strategy to tackle the other pressures our seabirds are facing.”",News/Environment,"Rare UK seabirds put at risk by ‘alarming loophole’, say campaigners",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/13/rare-uk-seabirds-put-at-risk-by-alarming-loophole-say-campaigners
5/13/2022,"The Globe’s audience serve as the easily swayed mob in Diane Page’s production of Shakespeare’s story of stolen power. A willing crowd, we’ll repeat whatever is chanted to us, happy to swap sides if we feel it will please the performers. The effect of this is funny, but never frightening. The cast of eight unravel this world of ancient Rome with gusto, but it hardly feels like the future of the republic depends on these decisions, or as if the person in charge could make or break the country. To the audience, it just feels like a bit of a laugh. In this modern-dress production, with clean pale suits begging for blood splatters, the well-spoken battle for power rarely broadens out beyond the characters’ concerns with their own morality. Without a sense of genuine peril, their final fights seem flimsy, and their ultimate actions often selfish. The brief encounters between Caesar (Dickon Tyrrell) and those who rise up against him are sped through, making it difficult to comprehend the strength of their relationships, and the impact of their conspiracy. Fighting for freedom, Brutus and Cassius are played both by and as women. Charlotte Bate is our determined, manipulative Cassius, her confident swagger later dissolving as the luck of the civil war changes sides. Anna Crichlow is noble to a fault as Brutus, her utter belief in her plan almost making her naive, particularly in the face of Mark Antony’s controlled passion in front of the crowd. If this is a commentary on women in power, it has little obvious effect other than a change in pronouns, but both performers hold the stage as they grapple with their own intentions. After a topless start that paints Mark Antony as being on a perpetual stag do, Samuel Oatley cements his character in a powerful performance at Caesar’s funeral, ruffling the public’s spirits to mutiny. But rather than feeling the electric danger of an angry, unruled country, the larger scenes often seem loose and scattered. It lacks a tautness. At the start of the show, a marble statue of Caesar stands grandly in the centre of the action, felled at the same time as its likeness’s flesh is stabbed. Once the statue is carried off stage, it’s unclear who or what marks the central force of this unintimidating production.

5/13/2022,"Antonio Conte urged Mikel Arteta to stop complaining after the Arsenal manager blamed the referee Paul Tierney for jeopardising his team’s chances of qualifying for the Champions League. Arteta was livid after Tierney awarded Spurs a 22nd-minute penalty, which Harry Kane converted, and then sent off Rob Holding for a second bookable offence after 33 minutes. Kane added another and Son Heung-min completed the scoring for Spurs in a resounding 3-0 win that keeps alive their hopes of pipping Arsenal for fourth place. Holding had already been booked for an earlier foul on Son when he then checked his run on to a long ball forward. The result loads the pressure on Arsenal ahead of their trip to Newcastle on Monday night. Spurs, who have closed to within one point of their north London rivals, can overtake them on Sunday when they face Burnley at home. “If I say what I think I will be suspended for six months and I want to be on the touchline for our next game on Monday night,” Arteta said. “I want the referee to come in front of the cameras and explain his decisions because we were so excited to play this game and this beautiful occasion was destroyed tonight. I haven’t spoken with Rob Holding but you can imagine that having to leave so early in a huge match like this is very tough.” Conte hit back strongly at Arteta, who had annoyed him last month when he complained about Arsenal’s fixture list. To Conte, Arteta had no grounds to moan after Arsenal succeeded in getting the original game at Spurs postponed due to a selection crisis even though it was not influenced by positive Covid cases. “Arteta is a really good coach but he has just started this job and he has to be more focused on his team and not to keep complaining,” Conte said. “In six months here [at Spurs], I have listened to him complaining a lot. He needs to be more calm. But if he doesn’t want to accept my advice, I don’t care. “The red card was clear for me and if we want to complain we have the opportunity every game to talk about referees, decisions and postponed games. If you remember, Arsenal did well to postpone this game in an incredible way when only one player had Covid. I didn’t forget this because it made us a bit angry. “If we want to complain I can also ask why we have to play again on Sunday at 12 o’clock and Arsenal do not play until Monday night and have one more day’s rest.” Son was unhappy to be substituted as he chased the Premier League’s Golden Boot award. His goal took him to 21 – one behind Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah. “Obviously I want to play always,” Son said. “What can I say? [It’s] the manager’s decision, I have to accept it. He said we have an important game Sunday, that’s why. It’s not a big deal. I’m not angry, just disappointed because I came off. I move on, and Sunday’s another game. I just wanted to keep playing, I just wanted to continue to play.” On Holding’s second yellow card, Son said: “I couldn’t see because I was down. I was running into the space and he just blocked the run. The ball is coming or not, it was a dangerous challenge. We have VAR. If there was no yellow card then VAR would check it, but look, for me it was a clear foul and clear yellow card.”",Sport/Football,Conte tells Arteta to stop complaining after Holding red in Arsenal defeat,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/12/antonio-conte-mikel-arteta-to-stop-complaining-after-holding-red-in-arsenal-defeat-tottenham
