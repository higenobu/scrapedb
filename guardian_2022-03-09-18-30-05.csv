3/9/2022,"The death of Kumanjayi Walker was a tragedy but he was “the author of his own misfortune”, and the jury must not find constable Zachary Rolfe guilty of his murder, a court has been told. David Edwardson SC, the defence barrister for Rolfe, said on Wednesday in his closing address in Rolfe’s murder trial that the Northern Territory police officer had acted courageously when he shot Walker and had been subject to a “flawed prosecution”. Rolfe shot Walker three times while trying to arrest him on 9 November 2019 in the remote community of Yuendumu, about 300km from Alice Springs. Rolfe is charged in relation to the second and third shots fired at Walker, a 19-year-old Warlpiri man. Rolfe has pleaded not guilty and is defending his actions on the basis they were justified in light of the risk that Walker, who had stabbed Rolfe with scissors immediately before the shooting, posed to him and a colleague, Adam Eberl. “This case is tragic,” Edwardson said. “A young man lost his life, and a young courageous police officer has been charged with the most serious offence under the criminal justice system … without any proper investigation, and that is a disgrace.” Edwardson used his address to criticise the executive of the Northern Territory police and three of the witnesses for the prosecution. He described Det Sr Sgt Andrew Barram, a senior NT police officer who reviewed the shooting, as neither credible nor reliable. He argued Barram “stood alone” in questioning Rolfe’s response as it related to his training and was “undoubtedly the most controversial witness”. He described Barram as a “mouthpiece for the executive” who had been “wheeled out” in “dubious circumstances” to bolster the lack of a “meaningful investigation”, given Rolfe was charged only four days after the shooting. He asked the jury to consider who they would rather have their back in a situation such as that faced by Eberl on the night of the shooting: Rolfe or the “armchair expert” Barram. Edwardson’s address came on the final full day of the trial, with the judge, John Burns, indicating he expected the jury would be able to retire to consider its verdict by tomorrow afternoon. He urged the jury to ignore attempts by the prosecution to show footage of the shooting incident frame-by-frame, describing it as “dangerous” and “wholly unrealistic”. He also urged them to ignore evidence about whether Rolfe had acted outside his training or orders on the night of the shooting. “What this trial is not about is a breach of general orders, some sort of non-compliance with orders or poor tactical awareness … it is [about] what Zachary Rolfe saw, heard, felt, and perceived when he made that critical decision.” Edwardson said the prosecution’s suggestion that Rolfe had lied about seeing Eberl being stabbed by Walker and seeing Walker’s hand on his gun was absurd – and showed their “true colours”. He sought to clearly define the threat posed by Walker, who he said was a “dangerous” and “violent” young man with a lengthy criminal record who was the “author of his own misfortune”. He also accused the prosecution of “pandering to the notion” that Rolfe should have “somehow treated Kumanjayi Walker with kid gloves”. “As tragic as it might be that a young man died as a consequence of his behaviour … in these circumstances, there can only be one verdict and that can only be not guilty of all charges.” The trial continues.",News/Australia news,"Zachary Rolfe trial: Kumanjayi Walker ‘author of his own misfortune’, court told",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/09/zachary-rolfe-trial-kumanjayi-walker-author-of-his-own-misfortune-court-told
3/9/2022,"A disabled man found hiding in a tunnel during a raid on an Afghan village compound was led away in handcuffs by Ben Roberts-Smith and another soldier before he was later found dead from gunshot wounds outside, a serving member of the SAS told the federal court. The testimony relates to a raid by Australian SAS troops on a compound called Whiskey 108, in the village of Kakarak in Uruzgan province on 12 April 2009, the site of two key allegations made by newspapers in their defence to Roberts-Smith’s defamation claim: that he was involved in the execution of two unarmed men found in the compound. Roberts-Smith is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies all wrongdoing, including the newspaper’s claims regarding Whiskey 108. Subpoenaed by the newspapers to give evidence in the case against his former comrade, the still-serving SAS soldier, anonymised as Person 40 before the court, said once the Australian troops had “fought-through” the heavily bombed compound, they found a small tunnel, secreted in a courtyard. Person 40 said Australian soldiers – through an interpreter – called for anybody hiding inside the tunnel to come out, and two Australian soldiers went in. Person 40 told the court two Afghan men came out of the tunnel. “Once they came out, they were obviously very frightened. One had a distinctive limp, that’s the person with the prosthetic leg. “Immediately coming out of his tunnel he was lifting his trousers, pointing to the prosthetic leg, expecting some sympathy from the troops.” Person 40 said the second man was balding and had a beard. He said the men were searched, “and from there they were marched off to another area, by Ben Roberts-Smith and Person 35 [another Australian soldier]”. “My understanding is that they would be TQed (tactically questioned), and Ben Roberts-Smith was the lead TQer on the ground. [TQ is] a quick set of questions to get some information and gain some advantage.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Person 40 said he expected the men to be taken back to the Australians’ Tarin Kowt base: “That’s the SOP (standard operating procedure).” But, under questioning, Person 40 told the court no prisoners were taken back to Tarin Kowt from that mission. He said he believed the men were Taliban. Person 40 said he was later standing guard when he heard a burst of gunfire fired “from about 30 metres away”. He did not see the shots fired, but recognised by sound the weapon as an F89 Para Minimi machine gun, which was carried by few Australian soldiers. Leaving Whiskey 108 at the conclusion of the raid, Person 40 said he walked past the dead body of the man with the prosthetic leg lying outside the compound. Shown a picture of the slain man in court, Person 40 said he recognised him as the man with the prosthetic leg found in the tunnel, and that he had seen the picture previously, stuck to the wall of the SAS’s unofficial Afghan bar on base, the Fat Ladies’ Arms.

One of those soldiers has given evidence he put his head and shoulders in the tunnel and saw the men in there. A fifth soldier has given evidence he saw the men at the tunnel entrance in the custody of Australian troops. Lawyers for Roberts-Smith have put it to each of those witnesses that their testimony about people in the tunnel was false. One soldier, Person 41, told the court he later saw Roberts-Smith “frogmarch” the man with a prosthetic leg outside the compound, throw him to the ground and machine-gun him to death. Under cross-examination, Person 41 conceded he had not reported what he had allegedly seen to his superiors because he “just wanted to keep quiet about the whole thing”. “I was a new trooper, on my very trip with the SAS... it’s the unwritten rule – you go along with whatever happens,” he said. Another soldier, Person 14, said he saw an unidentified Australian soldier carrying a distinctive weapon, a Minimi machine gun, throw a human-shaped object to the ground and fire a burst of bullets into it. He said he later saw Roberts-Smith carrying a Minimi during that mission but said he did not intend to suggest that Roberts-Smith was involved in the shooting and that other members of the patrol “potentially” carried Minimis. Roberts-Smith has consistently denied those versions of events, describing them as “completely false”. He said no people were taken out of the tunnel in the compound. “There were no people in the tunnel at Whiskey 108,” he told the court. In his evidence last year, he said he killed the man with a prosthetic leg outside Whiskey 108 because the man was a legitimate target, armed and running, and was killed in accordance with troops’ rules of engagement. “[He was] not running directly at me, but coming on an arc,” Roberts-Smith told the court. “He had his hand over the top of the weapon, because he was carrying it down next to his body like that… hunched over, as in, running like that with his shoulders down.” Under cross-examination on Wednesday, Arthur Moses put it to Person 40 that his testimony was incorrect, and that he had invented details, such as the presence of an interpreter on the mission. “There was no interpreter there on that day. What do you say about that?” “I disagree,” Person 40 said. “Have you always had that memory?” “That’s the truth.” Moses put it to Person 40 he was removed from his patrol for poor performance and situational awareness. Person 40 said that was incorrect and that he was asked to take responsibility for training Afghan National Army soldiers during that deployment. Person 40 remains a serving member of the SAS. The newspapers allege in their defence that a second man allegedly pulled out of the tunnel at Whiskey 108, an elderly man, was executed by another Australian soldier on Roberts-Smith’s orders. Roberts-Smith denies being involved in any execution at Whiskey 108, or any unlawful killings during his service in Afghanistan, and says there were no people in the tunnel and he did not give an order to execute anybody. The court has previously heard the prosthetic leg of the man killed on the mission was souvenired by another soldier and taken back to the Australian barracks where it was used as a celebratory drinking vessel. There is no evidence Roberts-Smith ever drank from the leg, and he has told the court he never did. Person 40 remains in the witness box. The trial, before Justice Anthony Besanko, continues.",News/Australia news,"Afghan with prosthetic leg ‘marched off’ by Ben Roberts-Smith before being found dead, court hears",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/09/afghan-with-prosthetic-leg-marched-off-by-ben-roberts-smith-before-being-found-dead-court-hears
3/9/2022,"Shayo Adebayo, an unemployed 28-year-old medical physiology graduate from south-west Nigeria, read from scores of abusive WhatsAapp messages and voice notes sent to her by debt collectors from quick loan companies. “I will destroy your life,” said one. “I want to see your payment or else all hell will be let loose,” said another. Another, which simply said “enjoy your shame”, arrived after a message calling her a fraud and thief was sent to her family, friends and everyone in her contacts, attached to a photo lifted from her Facebook page. Adebayo said the messages have been arriving on her phone almost every day since October, driving her to suicidal thoughts. She is not alone in her anguish. Unemployment, inflation and the cost of living have all risen sharply in recent years in Africa’s largest economy, fuelling a burgeoning quick – or payday – loan industry. Adverts for quick loans have appeared at bus stops and street corners and been broadcast on the radio. Messages like those sent to Adebayo’s contacts have gone increasingly viral on social media, bringing the companies’ attempts to harass and shame people who are struggling with debts into focus. For months Adebayo had been relying on regular 40,000 naira (£70) loans from a loan company based in Lagos, to pay for transport and food until payday. In October she lost her job and her debt spiralled. Between October and December Adebayo downloaded 32 quick loan application forms on to her phone as she struggled to cover her debts. “First I was borrowing just to make it to the end of the month,” she said. “Then I was borrowing to pay back the loan, then borrowing more to pay that one and on and on. By the end of it, I had taken loans from so many apps.” Adebayo said that as she began to struggle to pay off her debts, payment reminders quickly turned into sinister threats, first sent to her and then to almost everyone important in her life. As a condition for a loan, the application process required access to her contacts, social media accounts, family and friends, where she worked, worshipped and lived. “By the time you take the loan, you’re basically naked. They know everything about you,” she said. “So when you’re not able to pay, they start working on those contacts.” Debt collectors constantly called and sent texts and WhatsApp broadcast messages to her phone contacts. “Their weapon is your shame,” she said. “That’s why they do it. They use that to get to you.” Calls for the government to clamp down on the companies have grown. Many are accused of operating without registration, and of warning employees against revealing details about their operations, according to former staff. Some of the loan companies enforce illegal conditions, paying below the minimum wage and incentivising abusive behaviour, according to several former staff. Sophie Olubode worked as a debt collector for months last year at a quick loans company which employs more than 150 people and is based in an unmarked office building in Lagos. She described the work environment as “toxic”. Olubode said many staff were paid a basic salary below Nigeria’s minimum wage of just 30,000 naira a month, and received bonuses based on debt collection targets. Each collector was incentivised to take extreme measures, she said. “I remember a colleague of mine called one girl’s dad and told him that his daughter was in the police station and that until the father pays the debt amount, they’re not going to release the girl,” she said. In typical cases, people were requesting loans for as low as 2,000 naira, she said, often to cover things like food and transport costs and medical bills. The application process, she said, worked “like a trap”, and for many people outstanding debts of as little as 500 naira quickly ran to thousands. Most of Adebayo’s debts remain unpaid, but she said she turned a corner when she found support on a Facebook group used by 19,000 thousand people, many in similar or even worse situations. Stories of abuse and harassment are reported daily. People on the group encourage others to pay back their debts but not to be overwhelmed by the threats. Documents produced by loan company agents purporting to be from police are debunked, and people share messages where they’ve responded to threats with jokes or taunts. “Some of the chats are actually funny,” Adebayo said. “They joke about it. It makes you feel like: ‘OK, I can deal with this, they can’t kill me’.” The Facebook group was founded by 32-year-old Willis Osunde, an unemployed economics graduate, following his own ongoing experiences with fast loan companies. “When they defamed me, messaging my contacts, I lost almost everything,” Osunde said. “My marriage, my family, my job, all at the same time. It started from 2019, right up until last year … It occurred to me that I may not be alone.” Osunde is still paying back. In November, Nigerian financial crime and central bank authorities created a “lenders taskforce” to investigate the rise of loan sharks, with regulators becoming increasingly active at pursuing companies accused of harassment and abuse. Victims of illegal practices have been encouraged to contact the taskforce, though many in the Facebook group felt more urgent action was needed. “People are still vulnerable to these companies,” said Osunde. “In this economy, a lot of people are desperate.”",News/World news,‘Their weapon is your shame’: toxic abuse from Nigeria’s loan sharks,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/their-weapon-is-your-shame-toxic-abuse-from-nigerias-loan-sharks
3/9/2022,"A Ukrainian opera director who was arrested in Italy at Russia’s request said he hopes to be “the last ever victim of Russian exploitation of Interpol”. Yevhen (Eugene) Lavrenchuk, 39, was imprisoned in Naples for more than two months after Russia issued a call for his arrest through Interpol’s “red notice”, an instrument once used to hunt fugitive criminals but which now includes the names of political dissidents. Lavrenchuk’s name was later removed from the most-wanted list, with the global police agency telling Russian and Italian authorities in early January that his inclusion was inconsistent with an article in its statute that forbids “any intervention or activities of a political, military, religious or racial character”. Russia responded by attempting to secure his arrest and extradition from Italy independently of Interpol, claiming Lavrenchuk had committed financial crimes when he was director of the Polish theatre in Moscow. Lavrenchuk left Russia for Ukraine in 2014 in protest at Russia’s annexation of Crimea that year. He said the allegations against him are “completely false” and that he was being persecuted by Russia for publicly voicing his dissent. Naples’ court of appeal last week released Lavrenchuk at the request of the Italian justice minister, Marta Cartabia, who said that “in consideration of the dramatic developments concerning Ukraine” Lavrenchuk could be subjected to “treatment contrary to his fundamental rights” if extradited to Russia, owing to the fact that he is Ukrainian and opposed to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. A hearing is due to take place on 17 March, during which he is expected to be informed that the extradition has been rejected. Lavrenchuk, who was held at Poggioreale prison before being transferred to house arrest, is free to leave Italy but wants to stay for the judicial conclusion. “I’m grateful to Marta Cartabia for asking for my release,” he told the Guardian. “She wrote that I needed to be freed immediately because of the war, because I’m Ukrainian and because I opposed Putin – but I don’t want to speculate on the war, I want to be free, not because I’m Ukrainian, but because I’m innocent.” Lavrenchuk said he did not know he was being hunted by Russia until his arrest on 17 December at a hotel in Naples. He was forced to stay in the city on his journey between Tel Aviv, where his sister lives, and home city of Lviv in Ukraine, after missing his flight from Capodichino airport due to being held up at customs. “They took my passport, I didn’t understand why, but they eventually gave it back and I was told I could go, but by that time I was too late for the flight and there wasn’t another one to Lviv for two days. “So I booked a hotel in Naples and was happy as I had some downtime that wasn’t planned.” Lavrenchuk, who had posted a picture of his Tel Aviv-Naples boarding pass on Facebook, was arrested the next day. “It came as a total shock,” he said. “I’ve been very open and never ran away from reality. Russia has been looking for me since 2020, but I have travelled a lot and never had any problems at borders.” Russia’s accusations against Lavrenchuk date back eight years, when he allegedly defrauded one of his students by asking for money to pay for repairs to the Polish theatre. Lavrenchuk had lived in Moscow since 2000 but said that after 2014, the country had become “a grey zone in my mind”. He said he spoke out against Putin’s regime and claimed the persecution against him led to him being beaten up outside the Odesa opera and ballet theatre, where he was director, in December 2020. Misuse of Interpol’s red notices by authoritarian regimes seeking revenge against opponents has been well-documented by legal experts, human rights groups and in reports from the US Congress and European parliament. “There has been a lot of debate about the abuse of Interpol by Russia,” said Alfonso Tatarano, Lavrenchuk’s lawyer. Lavrenchuk said he had no hard feelings against Italy for his arrest, as the country was simply “respecting international conventions”, but has called for the international community to exclude Russia from the Interpol system. “Russia exploits this instrument against anyone who is unsympathetic towards it, compromising the whole Interpol system. I am not the first victim of it, but I dream about being the last.” Lavrenchuk said he speaks to his parents, who live in Lviv, in western Ukraine close to the border with Poland, every hour. “It is quite peaceful there right now, but that could change quickly … this period has been crazy, the war, the arrest.” He would like to return to Ukraine after next week’s hearing “by whatever means”. “But not to fight, I could never kill anyone, but maybe I could be helpful in other ways.”",News/World news,Ukrainian opera director freed in Italy hits out at Russia’s misuse of Interpol ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/ukrainian-opera-director-yevhen-lavrenchuk-freed-italy-russia-interpol
3/9/2022,"On a debris-lined street, not far from Lismore’s centre, Kym Strow and her wife, Sarah Jones, are staying well away from the Scott Morrison circus. “We don’t need someone picking up our hand to shake it,” Strow says. Instead, the pair are walking through their ruined home. They move slowly, still digesting. In spots, the floors are dangerous to walk on. They have warped and threaten to give way underfoot. Paint is peeling off the walls. Everything they owned is in a pile out on the street. But it’s not just their home. The cafe they’ve owned for nine years, Flock, is ruined too. Asked about Morrison’s visit to Lismore on Wednesday to see the flood damage, Strow says anger isn’t helpful right now. But it’s there, visceral in her voice, as she looks around at all that she’s lost. “This is desperation. We’re living in a fucking garage,” she says. “You need a leader who is going to stand up and say ‘I’m coming’ or ‘this is coming, you’re not alone’ and give hope. “People sure as fuck shouldn’t have to ask for it. It wasn’t even asking, it was begging.” Across town, at Morrison’s chosen public relations point – the emergency operations centre at Lismore’s council chambers – tensions were running high. A group of protesters were there to welcome him, staying for hours in the oppressive heat. Some brandished signs saying “this isn’t strange, it’s climate change” and “mental health crisis”. Morrison, unsurprisingly, didn’t stop to chat. His car ferried him around the back of the council chambers, while a line of police kept the protesters at bay. Inside, you could still hear them chanting. “The water is rising, no more compromising.” After an interminable wait, Morrison fronted the press to fend off criticism about the federal response, the inadequacy of the government’s effort on climate change, and the insufficient disaster payments, which, while now increased, are a drop in the ocean for those who lost everything. Then he left. In south Lismore, at the Norco ice-cream factory, a business ruined by the floods, a small band waited for Morrison for his second scheduled appearance. Sarah Moran, a lone protester, brandished a sign saying “SloMo”. Her brother works in the Norco factory. Like most here, he lost his home in the floods. Moran waited two hours for Morrison’s arrival. “When I realised [he] would be a while I just stood out the front, showing the people of South Lismore my signs,” she tells Guardian Australia. “They gave them a toot. They know what he [Morrison] was there for, he’s here for the photo opp, but won’t actually talk to anyone.” When Morrison was driven in, Moran seized her opportunity. “I yelled at him for a good 10 minutes, because there was no one else here,” she says. “My chest hurt. He hasn’t even offered a living wage, and you’re talking about people who were poor before. How dare you. You’ve got people who work here, they make the ice-cream, they’ve got no homes.” Morrison, perhaps wary of the 2019 bushfires disaster, didn’t stop to shake hands with victims in front of the press. He denied allegations of stage-managing his visit, saying some people didn’t want cameras in their faces amid disaster. Also outside the factory was Marcus and Leonie Bebb. They lived 500 metres down the road in a part of South Lismore that was devastated by the floods. “We copped the brunt of it,” Marcus Bebb says not long after Morrison had left. “Everybody did, but … we got it from all directions, left, right and centre.” Marcus whips out his phone and shows Guardian Australia video of his house.

In the darkness, Marcus and Leonie are wading through their inundated home, commentating as they go. “Push the fridge this way and follow the wall,” Marcus tells his wife, as they make their way through a flooded kitchen, appliances bobbing in the water. Leonie Bebb spent six hours on their roof. At one point, she saw a cow, desperate to survive, try to climb into a boat to escape the flood waters. Asked what they thought of Morrison’s visit, Marcus is frank. He’s not furious at the prime minister’s Lismore appearance, unlike others, and avoided the protest at the council chambers because it was political. Climate change isn’t his most pressing concern, he says. His family are homeless. “Yeah money is great, yeah making plans and rebuilding and fixing flood mitigation, yeah that’s stuff that’s got to be done,” he says. “But 4pm on a Wednesday, and I’m looking for a house. I’m looking for a roof. I’m looking for somewhere to put my family.”",News/Australia news,"Scott Morrison circus fails to impress Lismore, a town that has lost everything",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/09/scott-morrison-circus-fails-to-impress-lismore-a-town-that-has-lost-everything
3/9/2022,"The sunflower is Ukraine’s national flower and has become a potent symbol of hope and resistance during the invasion. It’s a concept Egle Plytnikaite, a Lithuanian illustrator based in Vilnius, has captured poignantly in her cover art for this week’s edition of the Guardian’s weekly news magazine. “My goal was to depict the unbreakable spirit of Ukrainian people who united for their country in the darkest hour,” she writes. “They are experiencing an absolutely horrible and inhumane terror from Russian occupiers and yet they manage to keep morale high and fight back with incredible force. There is a saying that ‘you cannot make a free man kneel’ and Ukrainians are a living example of that. “Slava Ukraini, heroyam slava!” (Glory to Ukraine, glory to the heroes) For many people, the true horror of Vladimir Putin’s assault on Ukraine was brought home last weekend by shocking images showing a family of four killed by Russian mortar fire while fleeing the town of Irpin. Yet, despite the dire conditions for civilians trapped in cities such as Kherson and Mariupol, determination to resist the Russian invasion stayed firm. Indeed, in refusing to leave Kyiv, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has epitomised courage and dignity in the face of Moscow’s onslaught. Our coverage in this edition focuses on the Ukrainian resistance, with Luke Harding reflecting on a week that felt as though decades had gone by. The diary of a Kyiv parent details a world turned upside down in a few days. Captured Russian soldiers express confusion and regret while, on Ukraine’s borders, a mass exodus continues, with about 2 million people having fled. Most have headed for Poland where, as Lorenzo Tondo observes, they have received a different welcome to the Syrian and Afghan refugees who arrived there last year.

3/9/2022,"History is like “a riderless horse, galloping through the night”. That was the image the then Spanish prime minister, Félipe González, used to depict the night the Berlin Wall fell. Since 24 February, when history stormed out of the stables, we have again been living in such a moment. Will we be able to bridle it again? With the invasion of Ukraine the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has thrown himself into the unthinkable. He has crossed the Rubicon into a time of war. He has no way back. Fire and flames, all or nothing. Political will and cool-headedness on our side are now of vital importance. The first is present in abundance, but the latter is in short supply. In times of great danger, unexpected forces are unleashed. Ukraine is fighting back, and in the opening battle for European public opinion it has achieved a stunning victory. We are no longer looking at a chaotic country on the Black Sea but a nation presenting itself as the bearer of Europe’s democratic promise, with the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, its hero. At least as unexpected is Germany’s geopolitical awakening. Massive defence investments, military support for Kyiv, the recognition of gas dependency as a strategic error: one surprise follows another. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, spoke in the Bundestag of a “zeitenwende” (historical turning point) for Europe, and took his parliament and public with him into that new era. It’s how Helmut Kohl seized the moment in November 1989. Three weeks after the fall of the Berlin Wall he single-handedly launched plans for German unification in that same Bundestag, astonishing friend and foe alike. This spectacular second German wende gives the whole EU more unity and strength. Now that Berlin is no longer applying the brakes, Europe is suddenly deploying the power of its economic sanctions with full force. It is also striking that the EU will be delivering weapons worth €450m to Kyiv, something that would have been taboo until 10 days ago. To the EU, this feels like crossing a Rubicon of its own. The European alliance for peace is now a party in a conflict with a military and nuclear superpower. The impact of Germany’s awakening is more far-reaching still. As long as Europe’s most powerful country remained militarily reluctant, Europe could not be strong. Now that Germany is accepting the realities of international power politics, a lot can change. France, which has always pushed for a more geopolitical Europe, will feel less alone. Other defence-spending laggards such as the Netherlands and Italy will no longer be able to hide behind Germany’s back. These events also empower Poland and the other central and eastern European member states. For years, their warnings against Russia were considered exaggerations in Europe’s capitals of the west and the south (except, perhaps, London). This has now changed. Just weeks ago, Poland was in the EU dock for offending against the rule of law. Today, peace and security trump such worries. But at a moment when Europe is fighting in the name of democratic freedoms, it should not lower its guard internally either. Europe shows plenty of political energy, but strategic calm is sometimes lacking – which is worrying. Twitter triumphalism about Russian military miscalculation is premature. Keeping heads cool is now a matter of life and death. The absolute priority is to avert the danger of a nuclear war. Bravely insisting that Putin is bluffing when he threatens one is irresponsible. But that fact does not seem to have got through to all the leading politicians. On the very day the weapons deliveries were announced, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, rashly put the prospect of EU membership for Ukraine on the table. The next day, Zelenskiy submitted an official request. Poland and other eastern European countries cheered in response, and the European parliament applauded. Hesitant member states kept quiet or took a nuanced position for the time being; nobody begrudges the beleaguered Ukrainians a ray of hope. In the recklessness of the zeitenwende, Von der Leyen appears to ignore the fact that for the Kremlin, which we are trying to bring to its senses, Nato’s and the EU’s promises to Kyiv since 2008 and 2014 are primary sources of conflict. Is this the best moment to feed the distrust of an opponent in full rage, and to add complexity to a situation already filled with dangerous ambiguities? Amid such high tension, diplomatic formulas of “long-term perspective” or “perhaps one day” are counterproductive. It is tragic but, at best, such statements have come too early. At worst, they will be another false promise. The upcoming EU summit in Versailles on 10-11 March would then repeat for the EU what the infamous Bucharest summit in April 2008 did for Nato: open a door to aspiring members while knowing very well they will never cross it in one piece. And how are we to envisage the outcome: the former Soviet Republic Ukraine joining the EU without becoming a Nato member at the same time? The latter is a geopolitical red line, since it would risk a nuclear war between the US and Russia. But without the US, can the EU rescue Ukraine from Moscow’s clutches based on its own military assistance clause (article 42(7) of the Treaty of Lisbon), the untested counterpart to the Nato treaty’s article 5, which says an attack on one is an attack on all? Unsurprisingly, Georgia and Moldova, two other countries eager to escape Moscow’s grip, followed suit within days in seeking EU membership. During the big EU eastward enlargement after the end of the cold war, Poland and the other new members entered Nato first. There was a gap of five years for some (like Poland), just a matter of weeks for others (like Slovenia), but the nuclear-security guarantee always came before the EU acquis – and not without reason. It is true that Finland and Sweden are in the EU but outside Nato (as are Austria, Ireland, Malta and Cyprus), but those states were neutral in the cold war, and not behind the iron curtain. Faced with the Russian threat, Finland and Sweden may now want to join. For the EU it might be more urgent to diminish the strategic ambiguity for these two current members by somehow extending Nato’s nuclear umbrella to them, rather than dangerously increasing it for all. To the beleagured aspirants, there are other ways to offer economic support and a prospect of rapprochement. The example of Ukrainian EU membership shows that even this war has not freed Europe of its inbuilt strategic insouciance. Thinking in terms of power, interests and identity, in terms of history and geography, is at odds with Brussels’ traditional self-image as a neutral and open space. The EU, after all, was built to overcome power politics, to tear down borders and walls, to disarm national rivalries. Its 1950s founders saw their community as the vanguard of world peace – not a player jostling with the rest but a moral beacon speaking the language of values, at once affable and haughty. This vocation was strengthened after 1989: Europe was the end of history. Now that history is brutally back, it will take time to amend these deficiencies and inbuilt blind spots. Simply calling for a “geopolitical commission” (as Von der Leyen has done) or for more “European sovereignty” (language that made it into the German coalition agreement) is insufficient. As is delivering weapons to Kyiv. An angel with a sword is still an angel. If Europe is to act as a power among powers, capable at some stage even of commanding destructive military force, it will need a different political language to speak about its place in the world. As Hans Kribbe writes in his book The Strongmen, the EU will need to change its ethos and demeanour. In sum, it should no longer be the angel battling to liberate the continent and the world from evil and tyranny, but a mortal, more strategic and real-political actor, which also understands the limits of its powers and its own time. In Versailles this week, EU leaders will discuss these matters. In the weeks ahead, one question will be: can we accept coexistence with a geopolitical adversary whom we despise, be it in Moscow or Beijing? Not crushing them as the devil incarnate, not trying to destroy them, not projecting ourselves (again) into a post-historical future of universal peace, but dealing with them as a rival? Politically, that is perhaps the real Rubicon that Europe needs to cross. Luuk van Middelaar is a historian and political philosopher.

3/9/2022,"Julia Armfield’s first book, a collection of stories called Salt Slow, set out a method. Choose a quotidian phenomenon – problem skin, say, or sleeplessness – and use it as a foundation stone for relentlessly logical, haunted edifices reminiscent of the contemporary gothic of Mariana Enríquez or Guadalupe Nettel. So a convent schoolgirl with problem skin, always shedding and peeling, undergoes a metamorphosis; or a town fills with Sleeps, each having stepped out of its owner “like a passenger from a railway carriage”. It is tricky to describe what happens without giving away the endings – which, when you become used to her method, are often prefigured in the beginnings, and in the classical tales her literalism both defamiliarises and renews: wolf-siblings, maenads, a gorgon. The effect is only heightened by a deliberate, vivid realism of place (Newport, Manchester, Glasgow; rented flats, bars in university towns) and a discerning interest in the shifting power structures of relationships. The collection ends with the extraordinary Salt Slow, in which a man and a pregnant woman find themselves in a small boat on an ocean that has drowned everything they know – a conceit that reaches both forward, to the predicted effects of climate change, and back, through Noah’s flood to creation. The world shrinks, to “lambent pupils on the water”, the “enterprising tentacles” of octopuses, their “liquid squeeze”. There is a sense that in this new reality, where whirlpools are “teeth in the ocean”, and the creatures of air and sea are growing “monstrously outsized”, humans are regressing to prehistoric beginnings. Her debut novel, Our Wives Under the Sea, takes this watery theme, adds it to the kernel of another of her stories (Cassandra After, in which the narrator’s girlfriend returns from the dead), and expands. It is told in two alternating voices: Leah’s, in the form of a journal she kept on a deep-sea dive that stranded her and two others in undersea darkness; and that of her wife, Miri, who presumed her lost, after Leah’s return. The tale travels, with Leah and the submarine, down through the missing six months and the ocean’s vertical zones (sunlight, twilight, midnight, abyssal, hadal), while on land Miri tracks how their relationship is changing in the present. Given the length of time and silence, it would not, even under the best circumstances, be easy to resume where they left off; but Leah has also changed in fundamental ways, and Miri is forced into a renegotiation. There are tropes, here, of pure horror: overt references to Jaws, voices heard by some and not others, terrible smells, a mysterious research centre. They keep the novel moving, but Armfield’s quarry feels larger: this is a kind of Orpheus story about transformation and return, a preoccupation underlined by an epigraph from Moby-Dick which reads, in part: “Consider the subtleness of the sea … do you not find a strange analogy to something in yourself? For as this appalling ocean surrounds the verdant land, so in the soul of man there lies one insular Tahiti, full of peace and joy, but encompassed by all the horrors of the half-known life.” Armfield draws on collective fears: the ocean, always, but also deep space, other people, God, madness, the unconscious (our “sunken thoughts”), dementia. The unknown is embodied as a physicalised idea. Melville’s island in the soul becomes tight locked-down rooms – the sub, Miri and Leah’s flat – surrounded by a lapping dark. As in her stories, Armfield is extremely good at anatomising the women’s relationship: the self-defensive blindnesses, the resentments and rituals and angers, grief for vanished joys – all the small moments of which lasting love consists. There are clever lines, everywhere, and wry, funny ones (“higher education seems to have leaked out of her in her mid-20s … replaced … by methods of treating black mould, by passwords and roast chicken recipes”). Teeth are a particular obsession – shining teeth on TV; toothaches; the knowledge that “to know the ocean … is to recognise the teeth it keeps half-hidden”. But there are many incidental beauties, too: Armfield has a poet’s ability to make a phrase both new and inevitable. Which is both one of the great strengths of her work as a whole, and a nagging worry. Perhaps because of their reliance on logic and myth, her short stories manage, in a weird way, to be both original and predictable. And what works in an intense few pages does not necessarily work at length: Our Wives Under the Sea feels stretched slightly too thinly over the body of an idea, especially as there is also a lot of nothing much happening. There are good reasons for passivity and lack of feeling – there’s nothing to do in the dark under the sea; Miri is in a state of denial and shock on land – but the risk in building characters who stare at what’s happening to them as through a veil is that the reader feels that way, too. And yet there is still real power here. “God keep thee!” ends the quote from Melville. “Push not off from that isle, thou canst never return.”  Our Wives Under the Sea by Julia Armfield is published by Picador (£16.99).

3/9/2022,"The story of online cowboy posse the Grannies starts, as video games so often do, in a character creation menu. Having played through the single-player story of Rockstar’s Red Dead Redemption 2, Kalonica Quigley and Marigold Bartlett, Melbourne-based friends and game developers, decided to try the online multiplayer portion of the game. On separate PlayStation 4s, and without one another’s knowledge, they each created elderly women as their avatars. It was an opportunity, laughs Bartlett over a Discord call, to cosplay as themselves in the future. Not long after, friends and fellow game-makers Ian MacLarty and Andy Brophy, rendered as elderly men, joined them. The group hung out in Rockstar’s staggering, almost photorealistic depiction of the US on the brink of the 20th century, taking photos and making their own silly fun beyond the game’s murderous objectives. Then they started seeking out glitches, faults or weirdnesses in its code. One involved a horse that duplicated the player’s body, a moment of surreal multi-limbed body horror in a game lauded for its picturesque pastoralism. Eventually, having exhausted the main map of things to do, the group set their sights on breaking out of the boundaries of the map. One evening, they approached a scrubby slope with their pistols drawn, intending to use a well-known hack to access the forbidden far reaches of the world. As if by magic, each of them slid up the verge and into a strange dimension that Rockstar never intended for any player to see. This journey is memorialised in a new travelogue-esque documentary titled The Grannies. MacLarty emphasises the vast scale of the out-of-bounds area, which is “way bigger than the main map”, he says. Bartlett describes the first moments within it as “spine-tingling”. Cautiously, unsure of how the terrain actually functioned, the foursome uncovered a place of sheer virtual otherness. In the south-east, a gloomy, sparse landscape of jutting mountains, and beyond that, recalls Bartlett, an “endless, unlit valley”. The north-east was filled with snow, glaciers, wolves and elk, and venturing farther west revealed a pine forest. At various points, gigantic polygonal objects rose out of the virtual turf like the black monolith of 1968’s 2001: A Space Odyssey: eerie, bizarre, bewitching. For the Grannies, all of whom are independent game-makers, this was a rare opportunity to “peek behind the curtain” of the secretive world of corporate game production. Quigley thinks this is why they found the space so engaging beyond its aesthetic peculiarities. “Part of the benefit of understanding how games are made is that we didn’t instantly reject it,” she says. “Often you see players commenting, ‘Oh, it’s a glitch, it’s broken, they [the game-makers] didn’t do a good job.’ But because of our experience, we were able to see that, no this isn’t broken, this is perhaps the foundation of how the full game was made.” Maclarty speculates that the out-of-bounds space they were exploring was, in fact, a deliberate part of Rockstar’s creative process rather than any kind of mistake. “As the game was coming together, maybe they generated this big landscape,” he suggests. “Then it went through this iterative process of becoming more and more refined, but they never bothered to get rid of those extra bits. It was actually more work to delete them.” The documentary, directed by Marie Foulston, who curated the V&A’s video game exhibition Design/Play/Disrupt, shows how this ethereal low-res landscape of half-finished objects could have become the exceptionally well-crafted video game Red Dead Redemption 2 ultimately is. It is at odds with Rockstar’s desire to preserve the aura of mystique around its making. “Games are still magical. It’s like they’re made by elves,” Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser told GQ. “I think you gain something by not knowing how they’re made.” The film was initially intended to be a multi-channel installation at Now Play This, a video game festival in London – two screens projected within a single space. While that version of the film was ultimately cancelled because of the pandemic, the documentary, now screening at film festivals across Europe, retains a dual-screen format. This leads to beautiful juxtapositions of images: on one side, a member of the Grannies posing as if for a holiday photo beneath an enormous floating boulder; on the other, an otherworldly desertscape and a piercing blue sky. After a while, the members of the Grannies started being inadvertently disconnected. The first to be cut off was Brophy, then Bartlett, until it was just Quigley and MacLarty left, sitting high above a cloudy abyss at 3am Melbourne time. Tired, and keen to call it quits for the evening, the pair decide to jump into the celestial expanse. After roughly an hour of constant descent, they landed in water, transparent mountains stretching high above them. The duo swam until, finally, they drowned, triggering their teleportation out of the netherworld and back into the main game map. Thinking back, Quigley describes the out-of-bounds region as “fragile”, as if it could disappear at any point. This turned out to be true. In September 2019, three months on from the first expedition, Rockstar released a patch that made it impossible for anyone to access the space using the hack up the dusty slope. Future PlayStation 4 players would never discover for themselves what the Grannies had explored. For Quigley, the trip has lived on in her imagination, just like those she’s enjoyed without a controller in her hands. “My memory now feels like a memory of a real place,” she says wistfully. “I remember the time of day, the weather, who was there, what we were wearing, and the excitement I felt seeing a giant grey cube floating above the landscape.” Future screenings of The Grannies will be detailed here.",Arts/Games,‘A giant grey cube floating above the landscape’: exploring the forbidden reaches of Red Dead Redemption 2,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/mar/09/a-giant-grey-cube-floating-above-the-landscape-exploring-the-forbidden-reaches-of-red-dead-redemption-2
3/9/2022,"Two things are about to happen in Britain. Next month ministers will increase the value of benefits by just 3.1% – the equivalent of a real-terms cut in light of soaring inflation. At the same time, household costs will rocket: energy bills will increase by 54% from April alongside record high rents and a national insurance hike. Food price inflation is at its highest in almost a decade, while even getting tested for coronavirus is about to add £6 to the bills. The Resolution Foundation says the conflict in Ukraine will further push gas and oil inflation in UK to above 8% this spring – the biggest hit to households since the 1970s. You don’t have to be an economist to work out what will happen next: if the money going out soars, while the money coming in shrinks in real-terms, millions of families who rely on benefits will be experiencing a socioeconomic catastrophe. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation says 9 million families on benefits due to low incomes will be £500 worse off on average from April. About 400,000 people could be pulled into poverty. Bear in mind that benefit rates are already at a 30-year low – a level so meagre that the government’s own research shows disabled people are unable to afford food, rent and energy bills, even before the inflation hike. April’s real-terms benefits cut comes only a few months after ministers cut the universal credit “uplift” of £20 a week. That move itself came after a decade of cuts and freezes to social security. The only things that have gone up for people on benefits in recent years are the queues at the food bank. Last week I spoke to Victoria. She told me she often gets through a day by eating out-of-date food; tins of beans handed out by her local “waste cafe”, where the poorest come for supermarket rejects. Severe ME, and heart and bowel conditions, means the mum of one relies on out-of-work sickness benefits to get by. But like so many others, the benefits system leaves her unable to afford even the basics. “My benefits don’t even cover a tank of heating oil,” she said. Instead, Victoria covers her windows in bubble wrap, keeps the curtains drawn and puts a blanket round her wheelchair to try to keep warm. When energy bills spike, Victoria calculates she’ll have to find thousands of pounds extra a year. Ministers may as well ask her to find a unicorn. Thirty charities are pushing the government to raise benefits by at least 6% to be in line with inflation and help soften the blow. Yet to expect the Conservatives to make the lives of people receiving benefits easier seems to miss the point. It is not a cliche to say the Tories fundamentally believe that someone on benefits should not be able to have a comfortable life – as if hunger pangs are a necessary motivation to get out of poverty. Or to put it another way: to a certain crowd, social security users not being able to afford food or heating is not a sign that the system is going wrong – it is the system working exactly as intended. Just look at the government’s recent plan to make universal credit “tougher”, including forcing jobseekers to travel up to three hours and apply for jobs they’re not qualified for or have their benefits docked. Britain’s welfare state is in many ways still based on Victorian morality politics, but instead of workhouses, poor and disabled people get sent to the jobcentre. The cruelty, as they say, is the point. Such austere policies are often presented under the guise that ministers “cannot afford” to increase benefit rates or ease eligibility even if they wanted to – despite the fact research shows the state has to shell out huge and increasing amounts of money not to tackle poverty. Remember that the same government that will cry poor over benefit rates next month recently found £5bn to write off fraudulent Covid loans. There is always enough money to do the wrong thing. It would be convenient to believe such thinking is confined to the worst of the right, but these are not particularly fringe opinions. They have been on the front pages of newspapers for years. It is accepted that hunger is an aberration for working families, but somehow justified for those who claim social security; that it is quite right for a certain level of suffering to come with being on benefits, but would naturally be wrong happening to “other” people. Even the use of the term “benefit claimant” is dehumanising, encouraging people to think of those who receive benefits as somehow separate from the population at large. The fact that many people on benefits are actually in work, and others are ill or family carers, is apparently still not enough to break this moral binary. Cutting social security in real terms in the middle of a cost of living crisis is, in many ways, the natural end point for this narrative, a darkly cruel turn of events that is only possible in a political culture that long ago lost its hold on decency or even common sense. Until we challenge it, this country is destined to repeat the same old mistakes, becoming an ever meaner society, one that is ill-equipped to provide even the most basic essentials for millions of its citizens. The pandemic showed dramatic state intervention could be mobilised in a time of crisis – and it would be hard to argue vast hikes in food and energy prices do not constitute another. Mass hunger and cold are just as much a sickness as coronavirus, and a vaccine is available: raising benefit rates; introducing a windfall tax on oil and gas producers; increasing the warm homes discount for poorer and disabled households; union-backed pay rises for squeezed workers; and, in the longer term, building more affordable and social housing. It is a reflection of how low we have sunk that to get there, we must argue for the most obvious of truths: so-called benefit claimants matter too.

3/9/2022,"A Morrison government decision to veto some academic research funding grants had made it harder to attract international talent to Australia’s top-ranked university, a Nobel laureate has told a Senate inquiry. In late December, the acting education minister, Stuart Robert, vetoed six Australian Research Council (ARC) grants in the humanities that had been recommended for funding, on the grounds that they did “not demonstrate value for taxpayers’ money nor contribute to the national interest”. The decision drew widespread condemnation from academics, ​​writers and intellectuals in Australia and internationally. The vice-chancellor of the Australian National University and a Nobel prize winner for physics, Prof Brian Schmidt, told a Senate inquiry into the issue that the “independence of the research grant process is a core part of how liberal democracies work”. He said humanities and social science research helped “build cultural awareness and an understanding of our society, which is clearly in the national interest”. “Elected politicians must of course be accountable for the use of public money, but we believe ministers’ decision making should in most cases stop at the point of deciding how much money Australia will invest in research and in what area,” he said. “This is more fundamental than issues of parliamentary process. It is about the health of Australia’s democracy and the vibrancy and resilience of our research system.” Schmidt said the ministerial veto powers had become a problem for recruiting talented international researchers, with some having “expressed their concerns to the point of saying: ‘I am not going to come to Australia until you sort this out.’” “Those are conversations I’m having with people at the highest level of institutions globally,” Schmidt said. “It is literally affecting my ability to attract talent to Australia.” The inquiry was initiated by Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi, who has introduced a bill that would remove ministerial right to veto ARC grants that had been recommended for funding via peer-review processes. Faruqi noted that of the 80 submissions received by the Senate education and employment legislation committee, only three organisations opposed the bill: the ARC, the federal department of education and rightwing thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs. Those expressing support for the bill included Universities Australia, the peak body for Australia’s 39 universities, the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia, the Australian Academy of Science, the Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering and the National Tertiary Education Union. Four Coalition ministers have vetoed research grants that were selected for funding after a competitive review process led by the ARC’s college of experts. In 2020, the then education minister Dan Tehan vetoed five grants on national security grounds; 11 were vetoed by Simon Birmingham in 2017 and 2018. Brendan Nelson was the first to exercise the ministerial veto power in 2005. Many who spoke at a public hearing on Wednesday described the “chilling effect” ministerial vetoes had on academic independence. The chief executive of Universities Australia, Catriona Jackson, said: “You wouldn’t ask the captain of Australia’s netball team to make a decision about the people who should be on the cricket team. “We respect the – in some cases, decades-long – expertise of those people in the college of experts to make very fine judgments about matters of … very complex research.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The deputy vice-chancellor for research at the University of Melbourne, Prof James McCluskey, said: “It can be bitterly demoralising and utterly bewildering when a grant recommended for funding by the college of experts is rejected apparently on the basis of a 150-word national interest test.” McCluskey and several others made reference to the Haldane principle, which suggests researchers rather than politicians should decide where research funds are best spent. “The Haldane principle was enshrined in the UK legislation, whereby research councils are autonomous and there is no ministerial power of veto,” McCluskey said. The president of the Council for the Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences, Prof Dan Woodman, said: “The best defence for our record of research excellence and academic freedom we think is something like this Haldane principle.” “It recognises the absolute need for ministerial input into the higher-level decisions about where money is allocated and under what criteria, but it states that the granular decisions about individual research proposals … should be taken by researchers themselves through peer review.” Woodman said that ministers had only deployed their veto powers in relation to applications from humanities and social sciences. The acting chief executive of the ARC, Judi Zielke, told the inquiry: “Peer review is the backbone of identifying quality research and robust research assessment.” “Nonetheless, as the ARC is spending public money, we also have other considerations which we must take into account,” she said. Asked by Faruqi whether she accepted that the ARC appeared to be out of step with the research community, Zielke – who has been in the role for five weeks – said she understood researchers’ concerns that a ministerial “response in this way does lead to a lack of credibility”. “I think that’s something that the ARC needs to step up and improve its communication in relation to,” Zielke said.

3/9/2022,"A trickle in Sydney’s rain gauge on Wednesday meant the city is yet to get a dry day in the past 16, extending the record wet start to any year for the Harbour City. The 0.2mm reading so far on Wednesday – the smallest measure the Bureau of Meteorology counts as rain – nudged the rainfall total at Sydney’s Observatory Hill to 872.6mm. Brisbane has been even wetter, collecting 1,059.8mm so far this year. That tally, though, trails 1893 when the Queensland capital was soaked by just shy of 1.3 metres of rain by 9 March of that year. @BOM_au says river levels at Windsor peaked around 7am Wednesday with flood levels nearly 1m above the March 2021 floods. The main flood peak in the Hawkesbury is now downstream of Wisemans Ferry.https://t.co/3xvSGIW0rO #NSWFloods pic.twitter.com/xETa755QQn Aside from the soggiest start to any year, Sydney is also enduring 16 days of at least 8mm of rain in a row, according to Ben Domensino, a senior meteorologist at Weatherzone. The next longest stretch of such falls was 10 days, back in 1908. “We didn’t break any one-day records but it was so persistent,” he said. Over those 16 days, the city endured 617.4mm of rain, the most for any 16-day period in records going back to 1858 – just pipping the 612.8mm recorded during a sodden spell in 1990. The second-wettest start to the year for Sydney occurred in 1956, when 815.8mm fell in the period up to 9 March that year. Residents in much of eastern Australia will have had to keep their umbrellas handy for a few months, not least because the La Niña event in the Pacific has increased the chances of above-average rainfall as rain systems shift westwards towards Australia. Even though La Niña is past its peak its influence will continue for some months, pointing to a wetter-than-normal autumn, Andrew Watkins, the bureau’s head of long-range forecasting, says. @BOM_au's outlook for March-May points to a wetter-than-usual autumn for eastern Australia, a region's mostly had a very wet start to 2022. pic.twitter.com/lJymVok2aj La Niña “will play influence on the weather through the autumn, but we also have warmer-than-normal ocean temperatures around northern Australia at the moment, and that’ll play some role as well”, Watkins said. The flooding, too, will itself provide a source for further rain. “Just having so much moisture in the landscape means that over land as well as over the sea there is water that can evaporate, of course, and fall again as rain,” he said. @BOM_au's outlook for April-June also has the odds tilting towards above-average rainfall for those sodden eastern regions. #NSWFloods #QLDFloods2022 pic.twitter.com/F077s4JDLc For all the mayhem, the current La Niña event – the second in as many years – is only a “moderate” one. “Sea surface temperatures got to be about 1.1–1.2 degrees cooler than normal” in the central Pacific, making it weaker than the 2010–11 and 1973–75 events, Watkins said. Still, with soil moisture levels already high and many dams near capacity going into this past summer, it didn’t take a lot of additional rain to cause flooding. For the same reasons, a wetter-than-usual next few months could mean more floods to come. “We don’t need big amounts of rainfall to see impacts because of how wet the landscape is,” Watkins said. “So we need to be cautious even of smaller rain events now as we don’t have to have big ones to create issues.”",News/Australia news,Sydney records wettest start to a year ever as BoM warns of more flooding to come,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/09/sydney-records-wettest-start-to-a-year-ever-as-bom-warns-of-more-flooding-to-come
3/9/2022,"The owner of KFC and Pizza Hut, along with the UK babywear chain Mothercare, have become the latest companies to pause business in Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. After a number of major western brands, including McDonald’s, Starbucks, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, bowed to public pressure and suspended operations in Russia, the Kentucky-based Yum! Brands followed suit. It said it was suspending KFC company-owned restaurants in Russia and finalising an agreement to suspend all 50 Pizza Hut outlets in partnership with its master franchisee. Yum! has 1,000 KFC restaurants in Russia, most of which are run by franchisees. The company had already previously suspended all investment and restaurant development in Russia, and said it would donate all profits from its Russian operations to humanitarian efforts, including a $1m (£762,000) donation to the Red Cross to help those affected by the war, and activating its disaster relief fund to support Ukrainian franchise employees. Mothercare has announced that all business in Russia, including shipment of all products, has been suspended. Its local partner has confirmed that it will be immediately pausing operations in 120 Mothercare stores and online. Russia accounts for 20-25% of Mothercare’s worldwide retail sales and was previously expected to contribute about £500,000 a month to group profit. The fast food firm McDonald’s is also temporarily suspending operations at its 850 locations in Russia. The company – which opened its first Russian branch in Pushkin Square in Moscow on 31 January 1990, when an estimated 38,000 Soviets lined up for hours to taste the Big Mac, a symbol of American capitalism – said it would continue to pay its 62,000 Russia-based employees. The Chicago-based company, which owns 84% of its stores in Russia, could take a big financial hit because of the closures because its restaurants in Russia and Ukraine normally contribute 9% of annual revenues, or about $2bn. A host of other consumer brands including Netflix, Levi’s, Burberry, Ikea and Unilever, the owner of Marmite and Ben & Jerry’s, have halted business in Russia, while professional services firms including KPMG, PwC, EY and Deloitte have also cut off businesses in the country and its ally Belarus. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, told CNN two days ago that “all western companies must withdraw from Russia” on humanitarian grounds. “We were upset to hear companies like Coca-Cola and McDonald’s remain in Russia and continue providing their products,” he said. There had been calls for consumer boycotts of McDonald’s and Coca-Cola on social media, from public figures including the American actor Sean Penn and the UK Dragons’ Den investor Deborah Meaden.",News/World news,Mothercare and owner of KFC pause business in Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/mothercare-and-owner-of-kfc-pause-business-in-russia-yum
