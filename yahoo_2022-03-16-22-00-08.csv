Earlier this week, Tara, who asked to have her last name withheld for privacy reasons, was checking her daughter Izzy's homework folder after school. ""I check her twin sister and her homework folders when they get home from school and had a very hard time keeping a straight face,"" the mom of three told TODAY Parents. Tucked inside Izzy's folder was a worksheet the kindergartner had completed at school. ""The assignment was to ask a question that they could survey high school students to practice tally marks and counting,"" Tara said. On the lined sheet of paper, the 6-year-old had practiced sounding out words to prompt the high schoolers for her poll question. Her teacher had taken the time to correct the innocent misspelling. ""She was so excited because they made the trip over to some high school students to ask her survey question,"" Tara explained, adding there was no additional note in her daughter's folder. ""Seeing that her teacher corrected the incorrect spelling to the correct, I figured there had to be something."" The next day, Tara opened up her email. ""Her teacher wrote me and said, ‘Good afternoon! So, this afternoon we were learning how to write survey questions in math. I got a good laugh out of Isabelle’s question and wonderful kid writing! Hope it brings laughter to your evening as well!’"" Tara shared. As for Izzy's project, she correctly identified that seven high schoolers like peanuts. “We are now looking for a spelling tutor if anyone is available,"" Tara joked.

3/16/2022,"It was an especially inspiring story of Ukrainian bravery, in a war replete with many of them. In video that spread quickly online on March 2, Artem Semenikhin, the mayor of the small city of Konotop, in northeastern Ukraine, stood on a planter outside the City Council and announced to a crowd that Russian soldiers had told him they would “raze the city to the ground with their artillery” if it did not surrender. Then Semenikhin asked the crowd whether they wanted to fight anyway, and the response was overwhelmingly in favor. The video was picked up by Western media outlets including Newsweek, the Daily Mail and the New York Times, which also showed a video of armed Russian troops being jeered by Konotop residents. Semenikhin was also featured in a ""PBS NewsHour"" segment, in which he referred to the Russian troops as “cockroaches.” There was just one thing missing from those accounts: the fact that Semenikhin is a member of the far-right, ultranationalist Ukrainian political party Svoboda, which emerged in 2004 from the former Social-National Party of Ukraine. In 2015, shortly after Semenikhin took office, the Jerusalem Post reported that he “refused to fly the city’s official flag at the opening meeting of the city council because he objected to the star of David emblazoned on it.” The newspaper also alleged he uses white supremacist dog whistles. Alan MacLeod, a writer for the far-left website MintPress News noted on Twitter that in Semenikhin’s interview with PBS, conducted remotely via video, one can see a painting of Ukrainian nationalist icon Stepan Bandera in the background. During World War II, Bandera led the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, which collaborated with Nazi Germany and killed Polish and Jewish civilians. At the time, Nazi troops were invading the Soviet Union, which Ukrainian nationalists were hoping to break away from. Bandera later had a falling out with the Nazi regime and was imprisoned in a concentration camp. He remains a highly controversial figure in Ukraine. After Semenikhin was elected in 2015, he replaced the portrait in the mayor’s office of then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko with one of Bandera. As a pretext for his invasion, Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly sought to connect the entire Ukrainian government to Nazis, vowing to “de-Nazify” the Kyiv regime. But Putin’s claim is absurd, based on the facts: Semenikhin's city of Konotop had only about 80,000 people before the war, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is one of the few Jewish leaders on the world stage and says he had many relatives killed in the Holocaust. Russia has been lodging this false accusation for years. In 2014, Russian state propaganda claimed the Maidan Revolution was also backed by Nazis as the pro-Western protesters toppled Russian-backed President Viktor Yanukovych. Experts on Ukraine characterized that assertion as “entirely baseless,” according to U.S. News & World Report. That being said, like many European countries, Ukraine does have far-right, nationalist political parties with racist tendencies. Svoboda, Semenikhin’s party, has had a number of incidents that drew widespread condemnation. Svoboda’s leader, Oleh Tyahnybok, has been accused of racism and antisemitism for such comments as saying Ukraine was headed by a “Muscovite-Jewish mafia.” On April 20, 2018 — Adolf Hitler’s birthday — the youth movement of Svoboda, C14, destroyed a Roma settlement in Kyiv by driving out its residents and burning down their tents. It’s worth noting, however, that Svoboda no longer holds any seats in Ukraine’s parliament, whereas far-right nationalists hold seats in the parliaments of at least 19 other European countries, including Hungary, Austria, Switzerland and Denmark.",World/Yahoo News,"Ukrainian mayor, heralded by many, is ultranationalist",https://news.yahoo.com/ukrainian-mayor-heralded-by-many-is-ultranationalist-161819300.html
3/16/2022,"Workers racing against a tight deadline to reopen the devastated cathedral of Notre Dame by Easter 2024—after it was nearly destroyed in a fire sparked by an electrical short three years ago—were shocked to find an ancient graveyard that included a “completely preserved, human-shaped sarcophagus made of lead” in the spot they were trying to set scaffolding. The roof and spire of the historic Parisian church were destroyed when a fire swept the structure in 2019. Since that time, more than 1,000 historic oak trees have been felled to rebuild the ancient roof. But as workers started the delicate work to rebuild the ancient spire that crumbled as the church was consumed by fire, they hit a lead coffin while digging the footing holes for the tall scaffolding needed to erect the new spire. Archeologists working on site—as is the practice in France when working on ancient structures—quickly identified the area as an ancient graveyard full of tombs, according to a statement by France’s cultural ministry. The centerpiece was the lead sarcophagus that had buckled under the weight of the church built above it, but remained perfectly sealed. Professor Who Scanned All of Notre Dame Died Months Before Fire Using a tiny endoscopic camera, workers were able to glimpse inside, where they noted what appears to be a perfectly mummified corpse, complete with hair and clothing. Archeologists on site say it was likely a senior dignitary buried in the 1300s, about 100 years after the cathedral was built. “You can glimpse pieces of fabric, hair and a pillow of leaves on top of the head, a well known phenomenon when religious leaders were buried,” Christophe Besnier, the lead archaeologist, told AFP. “The fact that these plant elements are still inside means the body is in a very good state of conservation.” The remnants of the graveyard are of “remarkable scientific quality” France’s culture ministry said Tuesday in Paris, where a handful of journalists were allowed on the site. The dignitary and others were buried directly below the central nave, above which the original spire was built in 1220. The spire that was destroyed in the fire was built in the mid-19th century after the ancient spire started to decay. Beside the lead coffin, archeologists have so far unearthed painted sculptures that include a pair of carved hands, vegetables, and the bust of a yet-unidentified bearded man. Other artifacts included remnants from the original church, which has been restored numerous times in its 800-year existence. To stay on track to reopen the cathedral on time, archeologists with the National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research have been given a deadline of March 25 to remove the artifacts—or rebury them for the next generation to find.

3/16/2022,"By Josh Smith SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea's decision to use the international airport near its capital city as a site for test-firing large missiles is ""absolutely bonkers"" and may be a way for leader Kim Jong Un to keep a close eye on his most prized weapons, analysts said. Debris fell in or near Pyongyang after a failed test-fire from the airport on Wednesday, Seoul-based NK News reported, citing unnamed witnesses and a photograph of the test showing a red-tinted ball of smoke at the end of a zig-zagging rocket launch trail in the sky above the city. There was no immediate confirmation of damage or casualties. The launch underscored the danger behind North Korea's decision to use the airport as a major site for test firing large missiles. The airport is in Sunan about 17 km (10 miles) northwest of the North Korean capital. ""The idea of placing a dedicated facility to support developmental missile testing at North Korea’s major international airport is absolutely bonkers,"" Jeffrey Lewis, a missile researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS), said in a report on Sunday. ""This is a very strange airport,"" he added. ""And it’s been getting progressively stranger all the time."" Since Aug 2017, North Korea has conducted an increasing number of major tests from the Sunan airport, including a pair of launches on Feb. 27 and March 5 that U.S. officials believe are developmental tests for the Hwasong-17 intercontinental ballistic missile. With the construction of what analysts believe is a ballistic missile support facility, the airport could take on a major role as North Korea prepares to potentially conduct its first full-scale ICBM test since 2017. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic ended international travel in and out of North Korea, the airport was hardly busy, with a handful of flights operating to cities in China and Russia. But North Korea appears to be the only country to have conducted missile tests from its primary international airport, and could be planning to use the site to develop technology specifically related to its ICBMs, Lewis said. In 2016 North Korea began constructing a facility next to the airport that appeared to be for ballistic missiles. A high-bay building within the facility is tall enough to allow for North Korea’s largest ICBMs on launch vehicles to be easily elevated into the firing position to allow for testing of both, as well as the training of maintenance and ground crews, the U.S.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) said in a 2020 report, citing satellite imagery. Dubbed the Sil-li Ballistic Missile Support Facility by CSIS, the complex also includes an unusually large covered rail terminal and buildings that are linked by drive-through access. The facility is also relatively close to ballistic missile component manufacturing plants in the Pyongyang area. ""The airport is likely favoured for its proximity to the capital, allowing Kim Jong Un potentially to attend and observe these launches, without his presence being reported,"" said Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the U.S.-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""Airports also provided large, paved areas for safely operating road-mobile launch vehicles."" The Vienna-based Open Nuclear Network disputed media reports this week that said North Korea had built concrete pads to accommodate the launch of ICBMs at the airport, saying the activity was more consistent with agricultural development. Wednesday's failed launch is concerning given the airport's proximity to Pyongyang, Panda said, noting that in 2017 a Hwasong-12 intermediate-range ballistic missile fired from a different location failed after launch and crashed into a populated area.

3/16/2022,"By Hyonhee Shin SEOUL (Reuters) - The USS Abraham Lincoln aicraft carrier led military exercises in the Yellow Sea, and air defence artillery at Osan air base intensified drills, U.S. forces in Asia said on Tuesday amid signs of an imminent North Korean long-range missile test. Tension on the Korean Peninsula has been growing amid speculation North Korea could test its largest intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) at full range as soon as this week, after threatening to break a self-imposed 2017 moratorium on long-range missile and nuclear testing. In a demonstration of air power in international airspace on Tuesday, the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) mobilised fighter jets from the USS Abraham Lincoln Strike Group along with other regionally based Air Force planes. U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) also said that in response to North Korea's recent missile tests its air defence artillery brigade at Osan air base had increased the intensity of its certification exercise to demonstrate its capabilities. ""DPRK's significant increase in its missile testing activity undermines peace, security and destabilises the Northeast Asia region,"" USFK said, using the acronym of North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. ""While this type of training is routinely conducted by U.S. Patriot batteries ... its increased intensity of its certification underscores the seriousness USFK takes against the DPRK's recent missile launch behaviour,"" USFK said. On Friday, Washington and Seoul said in a rare joint announcement that North Korea had used its largest-ever ICBM in two recent launches. Pyongyang said the launches were conducted as preparations for a satellite launch. Those launches did not demonstrate the missile's full range, and analysts said the North might have used only one stage of the missile or adjusted its fuel volume to fly at lower altitudes. The missile system, the Hwasong-17, was unveiled at a military parade in 2020 and reappeared at a defence exhibition in October 2021. ""The ICBM launches by DPRK are a brazen violation of multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions - as well as its international commitments - and pose a threat to regional neighbours and the international community,"" INDOPACOM said in a statement. A spokesman for South Korea's defence ministry said it was also closely monitoring North Korea's movements and maintaining a robust combined readiness posture with the U.S. military.

3/16/2022,"The West Virginia legislature recently passed a bill that would allow the state treasurer to restrict the state’s business with financial institutions that adopt corporate policies to cut off financing for the coal, oil, and natural gas industries. The legislation, which was first proposed by state Treasurer Riley Moore, advanced through the state House of Delegates and Senate over the weekend and now heads to the desk of Republican Governor Jim Justice. If Senate Bill 262 becomes law, Moore will be able to create a list of restricted financial institutions that “have been shown to refuse, terminate or limit commercial activity with coal, oil or natural gas companies without a reasonable business purpose,” his office said in a statement on Monday. Companies on the restricted list may be excluded from eligibility for state banking contracts “ensuring that financial institutions are not entrusted with the state revenue and taxpayer dollars they are attempting to diminish,” Moore’s office said. “I am proud to lead the way to protect our coal, oil and natural gas companies from unfair, anti-American attempts to cut off their access to capital and banking services,” Moore said in a statement. “The current situation in Europe clearly demonstrates the dangers of letting woke capitalists weaken and destroy our domestic energy producers. It’s time to fight back against those who are trying to wipe out thousands of middle-class jobs, and once again put America first and restore our energy independence.” A spokesperson for Moore told Bloomberg West Virginia has paid banks annual fees ranging from thousands of dollars to upwards of $3 million. Moore’s office does not have a list of financial institutions it expects would be restricted by the proposal, according to the report. The bill’s passage in the state legislature comes months after Moore led a coalition of financial officers from 15 states that warned the U.S. banking industry in November that they plan to take “collective action” against banks that cut off financing for the coal, oil, and natural gas industries. The group threatened to scrutinize or potentially curtail future business with banks that adopt an “economic boycott” of those industries in a letter to financial institutions including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs. The group included state treasurers, auditors and comptrollers from West Virginia, Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Louisiana, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming, Alabama, Texas and Kentucky.  The letter put the financial institutions that have “adopted policies aimed at diminishing a large portion of our states’ revenue” on notice, saying the banks have “a major conflict of interest against holding, maintaining, or managing those funds.” “This is not really a boycott,” Moore told National Review at the time. “I’m a market participant and I’m exercising my preference not to work with these banks.” He added that the treasurers “want banks to go back to being banks and not instruments of this woke agenda,” saying that “woke capitalism” is “nonsense.” The treasurers noted in November that the coal, oil and natural gas industries provide well-paying jobs, health insurance, basic infrastructure and quality of life to citizens in every state. In comments to National Review at the time, Moore accused the banks of trying to control Americans’ lives. “They sold us on globalization and now the only businesses in our small towns are Walmarts. Now they want to eliminate one of the only remaining industries that gives West Virginians a good living.” Fifteen States Respond to ‘Woke Capitalism,’ Threaten to Cut Off Banks That Refuse to Service Coal, Oil Industries Biden Concedes Administration ‘Can’t Do Much’ about Record-High Gas Prices Joe Manchin Urges Biden to Up Domestic Energy Production, Ban Russian Oil Imports",Business/National Review,"West Virginia Legislature Passes Measure to Cut Off Banks That Refuse to Service Coal, Oil Industries",https://news.yahoo.com/west-virginia-legislature-passes-measure-210523650.html
3/16/2022,"A leading researcher into government secrets says he may have found the “jackpot” of documents on potential extraterrestrial encounters. John Greenewald Jr., who operates The Black Vault, a website dedicated to revealing declassified government documents obtained via Freedom of Information Act requests, said he asked the Barack Obama Presidential Library for anything it has on UFOs and related phenomena. What he got back left him “absolutely floored”: Unfortunately, Greenewald won’t get to see any of those documents and electronic files anytime soon. In a followup tweet, he wrote that the library won’t let him view any documents in person and estimated it would take 16 years to fulfill his FOIA request. “It took the wind right out of my sails of excitement,” he wrote on Twitter, and called on lawmakers to help expedite the request. Greenewald is the author of several books, including InsideThe Black Vault: The Government’s UFO Secrets Revealed, which reportedly involved collecting some 8,000 FOIA requests. Although it’s not clear what might be contained in the Obama Library documents, Motherboard noted that they could be procedural documents or contain previously known information. But the sheer volume of content is enticing to researchers and enthusiasts. The revelation comes amid an unprecedented series of disclosures about UFOs, or as the federal government now prefers to call them, UAPs (unidentified aerial phenomena). Several videos leaked in 2017 to The New York Times and The Washington Post showed encounters with fast-moving objects, including one nicknamed “Tic Tac” because of its resemblance to the candies. Unlike the candies, this object ― still unknown, at least publicly ― plunged from 60,000 feet to just 50 feet in a matter of seconds: The U.S. Navy later confirmed the authenticity of the videos to The Black Vault. A 2020 report in The Times said that a Pentagon consultant had briefed Defense Department officials on items retrieved from “off-world vehicles not made on this Earth.” Obama addressed the subject last year, saying the federal government doesn’t have a secret base with alien spaceships. “But what is true and I’m actually being serious here, is there are, there’s footage and records of objects in the skies that we don’t know exactly what they are,” he said on “The Late Late Show.” “We can’t explain how they moved, their trajectory. They did not have an easily explainable pattern.” This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.",U.S./HuffPost,UFO Expert 'Absolutely Floored' By Revelation From Obama Library,https://news.yahoo.com/ufo-expert-absolutely-floored-revelation-080935069.html
