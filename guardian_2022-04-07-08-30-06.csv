4/7/2022,"Sydney and surrounding areas of New South Wales were battered by severe storms on Thursday morning, with up to 140mm of rain forecast over six hours. The Bureau of Meteorology issued a severe weather warning just before 5am, predicting rainfall of between 60mm and 100mm would fall over a wide stretch of the already sodden state, including Sydney, the Illawarra, the south coast, the central and southern tablelands, and parts of the Hunter. On the coast, rainfall could reach up to 140mm, the BoM said. A flash-flooding warning was issued for coastal parts of the south coast, Illawarra, metropolitan Sydney and the southern Hunter region, extending into the southern and central tablelands in the afternoon. Flood warnings were also issued for Bega, Batemans Bay, Nowra, Goulburn, Wollongong, Sydney, Katoomba and Gosford.

There were 12 flood warnings in place across the state on Thursday, mostly in catchments that are already saturated from more than a month of heavy rainfall. Lismore and surrounding towns have endured two one-in-100 year floods in a month. The severe floods have also killed hundreds of thousands of fish in the Richmond River. A final flood warning was issued for the Clarence River at Grafton in the northern rivers region, which peaked on Tuesday and was falling on Thursday morning. There was also a warning of possible major flooding at the Upper Nepean River at Menangle, which could reach the major flood level of 12.2m on Thursday afternoon, and minor to moderate flooding throughout the Hawkesbury and Nepean catchments. The Georges River at Liverpool and Milperra was also predicted to reach major flooding levels early on Thursday afternoon. The river was tipped to exceed the moderate flood level of 3m about 11am, and major flood levels of 4.5m in the afternoon. The State Emergency Service warned people in areas with flood warnings in place to prepare to leave when advised to do so. “Ensure you take pets and valuables with you,” the SES said. The assistant commissioner, Dean Storey, said the SES had conducted 11 rescues and responded to almost 600 requests for help in the past 24 hours. “We’re expecting those numbers to increase unfortunately today as that rain continues,” he told Nine’s Today program. “It’s a very dynamic and volatile situation.” The bad weather has been driven by a strong upper trough over the centre of NSW, working to deepen another trough sitting off the coast. The systems were expected to weaken on Friday morning.",News/Australia news,Sydney battered by severe storms as NSW braces for widespread flash-flooding again,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/07/sydney-nsw-weather-severe-storms-forecast-rain-flash-flooding
4/7/2022,"The top 0.1% of earners in the UK have annual incomes in excess of £500,000, according to a study by a leading thinktank that shows the effect of “unfair” tax rates available to business owners. More than 50,000 people in the top income bracket account for 6% of all earnings – 60 times greater than their population share, said the Institute for Fiscal Studies in a report covering the 10 years to 2019. It showed that more than half of the top 1% richest adults lived in London and the south-east, while almost 60% were aged between 45-64, and as few as a fifth were women. The report, Top Income Inequality and Tax Policy, shows that earnings from self-employment and business ownership were far more important for those at the top end compared with low and middle earners. Suggesting that this has consequences for inequality because income from company ownership is taxed at a lower rate than earnings from work, the report argues that reforms could be launched to tackle unfairness in the tax system. Alex Beer, welfare programme head at the Nuffield Foundation, which funded the research as part of the IFS Deaton review of inequalities, said: “The current design of the tax system, including the way in which different forms of income are taxed at different rates, is unfair and inefficient, penalising employees and distorting investment decisions, to the detriment of social wellbeing.” According to the report, business income – from either self-employment or owning and running a company – accounts for 21% of total incomes for the top 1% of adults and 29% for the top 0.1%, compared with just 9% for the rest of the population at large. It said business owner-managers could effectively choose to take income out of their company through the form of a salary, dividends, or capital gains – allowing them to benefit from lower rates of tax. The report pointed to a preferential 10% rate of capital gains tax, called business asset disposal relief, while saying that company owner-managers were able to access tax rates of just 27% on income taken in the form of capital gains. In comparison, the average tax rate on wage earners in the top 1% is 42%. The government sets the basic rate of income tax at 20% on earnings above the tax-free personal allowance of £12,571, up to £50,270, with a rate of 40% on income above £50,271, and 45% above £150,000. Despite the lower rates open to business owners, the IFS said taxes on the highest-paid wage earners had increased since 2010. As a result, the share of overall after-tax income in the UK received by the highest earners had fallen from 14% in 2009-10 to 11% in 2018-19. Illustrating the gulf between public and private sector pay at senior levels, the Taxpayers’ Alliance said in a report earlier this week that only 2,921 people employed by local authorities in 2020-21 received more than £100,000 in total remuneration and 739 received over £150,000, 46 more than the previous year. According to the Institute for Government, just 1,560 of the 456,410 civil servants earned more than £100,000 in 2020. Across the whole civil service, the majority of staff (55%) were paid below £30,000.",News/Business,"UK’s top 0.1% earners have annual income of over half a million, says IFS",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/07/uks-top-01-earners-have-annual-income-of-over-half-a-million-says-ifs
4/7/2022,"Adele, Ed Sheeran and Inflo, a musician billed as “the most influential and mysterious producer on the planet”, have dominated the Ivor Novello award nominations in a year in which drill artists were also recognised by the most prestigious songwriting awards in the UK. Dean Wynton Josiah Cover, AKA Inflo, leads the award nominations, which celebrate Britain’s best songwriters and composers, with four, while Ed Sheeran – who has just won a plagiarism battle over his song Shape of You – has three nods and Adele is in the running for two awards, including songwriter of the year. Adele will compete for the songwriting award with Coldplay, Raye, Dave and Ed Sheeran, who also has two songs – Bad Habits and Shivers – nominated in the PRS for music most performed work category. Inflo has credits on three of the five albums nominated in the best album category, with work on Cleo Sol’s Mother, Sault’s Nine and Little Simz’s Sometimes I Might Be Introvert, while Nottingham duo Sleaford Mods’ LP Spare Ribs and Laura Mvula’s 80s pop-inflected Pink Noise round out the category. Mvula said she was delighted to receive the nomination for the album she worked on during lockdown after being dropped by her label, despite producing two Mercury prize-nominated albums. “Sometimes it was hard to imagine getting to the finish line, so to know that it has made some impact in such strange times is really exciting for me,” she added. The songwriter said the lineup for this year’s Novellos, which is one of the most diverse ever, was important, especially for young Britons who will see people like themselves represented. She said: “They need to know that they can do whatever they want to do, especially when it comes to creativity and the arts. I’m genuinely thrilled to feel empowered and celebrated, and to be a symbol of something that is needed and positive in this ever-changing climate.” The hip-hop genre drill was also recognised with Russ Millions and Tion Wayne’s number-one single Body nominated in the best contemporary song category, alongside FKA Twigs’ Don’t Judge Me, a collaboration with rapper Headie One and Fred Again. James Blake’s track Coming Back, featuring SZA, PinkPantheress’s Just For Me and Little Simz’s I Love You, I Hate You all secured nods. Elsewhere, Jonny Greenwood’s soundtrack for Pablo Larraín’s Diana, Princess of Wales biopic, Spencer, is up against scores for After Love, Censor, The World To Come and Edgar Wright’s time-travelling psychological thriller Last Night In Soho. Inflo’s domination of the Ivor Novello nominations continues his meteoric rise. He has already won a Novello for Little Simz’s Grey Area and worked on Michael Kiwanuka’s Mercury-prize-winning album Kiwanuka, before teaming up with Simz again on her award-winning album Sometimes I Might Be Introvert and contributing to Adele’s 30. He is a member of the press-shy Sault project, which has melded hip-hop, soul, spoken word and R&B over the course of five releases, and at this year’s Brits he became the first black Briton to win producer of the year, following in the footsteps of Brian Eno, Peter Gabriel and Calvin Harris.",Arts/Music,"Inflo, Ed Sheeran and Adele lead Ivor Novello nominations",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/07/inflo-ed-sheeran-adele-dominate-ivor-novello-nominations
4/7/2022,"The human rights group Liberty is threatening to sue the government and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) over the bitterly contested law of joint enterprise, arguing that it is discredited and racist in the way the authorities pursue it. Under the law, people present when a person is killed can be convicted of murder despite not committing any serious violence themselves, if they are found to have “encouraged or assisted” the perpetrator. Liberty is acting for the campaign group Joint Enterprise Not Guilty By Association (Jengba), which supports approximately 1,400 people in prison who believe they have been unjustly convicted of serious crimes perpetrated by somebody else. Many joint enterprise prosecutions cast all participants in an incident as a gang, which ascribes to them a collective motive for an attack. There have long been accusations, supported by academic studies and parliamentary inquiries, that the gang label is attached disproportionately and without adequate evidence to black and minority-ethnic young men. The Guardian has reported extensively on the 2017 case in which seven black and mixed-race teenagers were convicted of murder, and four more of manslaughter, after the fatal stabbing in Moss Side, Manchester, of Abdul Hafidah, 18, by one of them. Greater Manchester police and the CPS portrayed all the young men as a gang who “controlled territory” but presented minimal evidence of criminal gang activity, and most of the defendants had no criminal records. Neither the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) nor the CPS records numbers of joint enterprise prosecutions, nor the defendants’ ethnicity or age, nor whether gang evidence was advanced in a case. Liberty argues that means the authorities are breaching their duties under the Equality Act because they are failing to “ascertain the extent of, and eliminate, any race discrimination in the use of joint enterprise laws”. In a letter sent to justice secretary Dominic Raab and director of public prosecutions Max Hill last month, Liberty called on the MoJ and the CPS to immediately begin recording and publishing such data, and “properly take into account” the duty to apply the joint enterprise law equally. Liberty threatened to issue a judicial review claim against both the MoJ and the CPS if they did not respond positively by Monday, 4 April. Both have asked for more time to respond. Lana Adamou, a lawyer at Liberty, said: “We all want our communities to be safe, and for our laws to treat us equally. But joint enterprise is overwhelmingly used against people from marginalised communities, especially young black men, and drags people unfairly into the criminal justice system. “It’s completely unacceptable that there is still no official data being recorded about how the doctrine is used and who it is used against. By failing to do so, the justice system has been recklessly sweeping thousands of young black men into the prison system.” Gloria Morrison, co-founder of Jengba, said that joint enterprise has been applied in a racist way to “over-criminalise” people, and described it as “common law, used against common people, that makes no common sense”. A CPS spokesperson said: “We have received a letter from Liberty regarding joint enterprise prosecutions and we will respond in due course.” An MoJ spokesperson said: “While charging decisions are made by independent prosecutors, we are currently considering the feasibility of collecting data on joint enterprise cases.”",News/World news,Liberty threatens to sue government over ‘racist’ joint enterprise law,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/07/liberty-threatens-sue-government-racist-joint-enterprise-law
4/7/2022,"A downcast Thomas Tuchel declared Chelsea’s position in the Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid to be irretrievable after their 3-1 first-leg defeat at Stamford Bridge and described his team’s slump in form as “alarming”. Chelsea must produce a significant turnaround at the Bernabéu next Tuesday if they are to hold hope of retaining the trophy and Tuchel poured cold water on their hopes of doing so, saying he could not explain an atrocious five days during which they also lost 4-1 at home against Brentford. “No, not at the moment, no,” he said when asked whether the tie was still alive despite Karim Benzema’s decisive hat-trick. “Because we have to find our level back. I don’t know where it is, since the international break. Our first half is a repetition of the second half against Brentford, in a quarter-final of the Champions League against Real Madrid. “We were so far off our level in absolutely everything the game demands; you cannot expect a result for his kind of performance.” Tuchel reiterated his shock at two such comprehensive defeats at Stamford Bridge, which followed a run of 10 wins from 14 unbeaten games in all competitions. “After the international break we don’t look the same and I don’t really have an explanation, as before we were on a long winning streak and were very competitive,” he said. “We didn’t change anything: it’s alarming. Two games, seven goals [conceded], but nothing has changed.” Invited to clarify his assertion that the tie cannot be won from here, Tuchel doubled down. “If you want to put it [like] this sentence, put it [like] this sentence,” he said. “Today, with this performance, is it alive? No. If we don’t get our heads and legs straight then we will not beat Southampton [on Saturday] and then this tie is not alive. If things change, maybe, but we need three goals and how often did this happen? “We need to find our competitive spirit and then we can talk. If we keep on playing like this we will lose in Southampton and then we don’t need to think about the Bernabéu: we will get hammered in the Bernabéu.” Carlo Ancelotti struck a less strident note despite a commanding performance from his side, who were 2-1 up at half-time thanks to two stunning Benzema headers before the Frenchman capitalised on Edouard Mendy’s mistake 45 seconds into the second period. “Of course we have a lead but the tie is still open,” he said. “We no longer have the away goals rule, which is an advantage for Chelsea now. I think Real Madrid played better but there is another game to go and anything can happen.”",Sport/Football,"Chelsea’s position in Champions League quarter-final irretrievable, says Tuchel",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/06/chelseas-position-in-champions-league-quarter-final-irretrievable-says-tuchel
4/7/2022,"The House voted on Wednesday to hold two of Donald Trump’s top advisers – Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino – in criminal contempt of Congress for their months-long refusal to comply with subpoenas issued by the House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol attack. The approval of the contempt resolution, by a vote of 220 to 203, sets the two Trump aides on the path toward criminal prosecution by the justice department as the panel escalates its inquiry into whether Trump oversaw a criminal conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election. Congressman Jamie Raskin, a member of the select committee who introduced the contempt resolution to the House floor, said the select committee needed the House to advance the measure in order to reaffirm the consequences for defying the January 6 investigation. Citing a ruling by a federal judge last week that Trump “likely” committed felonies to return himself to the Oval Office for a second term, Raskin said on the House floor that the panel wanted Navarro and Scavino’s cooperation because they engaged in trying to overthrow an election. But having refused to comply with their subpoenas in any form, Raskin said that “these two witnesses have acted in contempt of Congress and the American people; we must hold them in contempt of Congress and the American people”. The contempt citations approved by the House now head to the justice department and the US attorney for the District of Columbia, Matthew Graves, who is required by law to weigh a prosecution and present the matter before a federal grand jury. Should the justice department secure a conviction against the Trump aides, the consequences could mean up to a year in federal prison, $100,000 in fines, or both – though it would not force their compliance, and pursuing the misdemeanor charge could take months. The subpoena defiance by Navarro and Scavino meant the select committee was ultimately unable to extract information directly from them about Trump’s unlawful scheme to have then-vice president Mike Pence stop Joe Biden’s election win certification on 6 January. But the panel has quietly amassed deep knowledge about their roles in the effort to return Trump to office in recent weeks, and senior staff decided that they could move ahead in the inquiry without hearing from the two aides, say sources close to the inquiry. The determination by the select committee that Navarro and Scavino’s cooperation was no longer essential came when it found it could fill in the gaps from others, the sources said, and led to the decision to break off negotiations for their cooperation. The final decision to withdraw from talks reflected the panel’s belief that it was not worth the time – the probe is on a time crunch to complete its work before the November midterms – to pursue their testimony for potentially only marginal gain, the sources said. House investigators had sought cooperation from Navarro, a former Trump senior advisor for trade policy who became enmeshed in the effort to reverse Trump’s election defeat, for around a month until it became apparent they were making no headway. The select committee issued a subpoena to Navarro since he helped devise – by his own admission on MSNBC and elsewhere – the scheme to have Pence stop Biden’s certification from taking place as part of one Trump “war room” based at the Willard hotel in Washington. Navarro also worked with the Trump campaign’s legal team to pressure legislators in battleground states win by Biden to decertify the results and instead send Trump slates of electors for certification by Congress at the joint session in January 6. But when that plan started to go awry, Navarro encouraged then-Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to call political operative Roger Stone to discuss January 6, the panel said in its contempt of Congress report published last week. The former Trump aide, however, told the select committee – without providing any evidence – that the former president had asserted executive privilege over the contents of his subpoena and would therefore not provide documents or testimony. With Scavino, the select committee first issued Trump’s former deputy White House chief of staff for communications in September last year, since he had attended several meetings with Trump where election fraud matters were discussed, the panel said. But after the panel granted to Scavino six extensions that pushed his subpoena deadlines from October 2021 to February 2022, the former Trump aide also told House investigators that he too would not comply with the order because Trump invoked executive privilege. The select committee rejected those arguments of executive privilege, saying neither Navarro nor Scavino had grounds for entirely defying the subpoenas because either Trump did not formally invoke the protections, or because Biden ultimately waived them. At the business meeting last week where the select committee voted unanimously to recommend that the full House find Navarro and Scavino in contempt of Congress, Raskin delivered an emotional rebuke of the supposed executive privilege arguments. “This is America, and there’s no executive privilege here for presidents, much less trained advisors, to plan coups and organize insurrections against the people’s government in the people’s constitution and then to cover up the evidence of their crimes.“These two men,” Raskin said of Navarro and Scavino, “are in contempt of Congress and we must say, both for their brazen disregard for their duties and for our laws and our institutions.” Attending an event featuring Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday night, Navarro made a point of appearing aloof to his impending referral to the justice department. “Oh that vote,” Navarro said dismissively, the Washington Post reported.",News/US news,House votes to hold Trump duo Navarro and Scavino in contempt of Congress,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/06/house-navarro-scavino-trump-advisers-contempt
4/7/2022,"Catching Covid is associated with a fivefold increase in the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and a 33-fold increase in risk of a potentially fatal blood clot on the lung in the 30 days after becoming infected, data suggests. The findings, published in the British Medical Journal on Thursday, could help explain a doubling in the incidence of, and deaths from, blood clots in England since the start of the pandemic compared with the same periods in 2018 and 2019. They also help to put the very small increased risk of blood clots associated with Covid-19 vaccination into context. “The degree of complications associated with Covid-19 is much stronger and lasts for much longer than what we might be getting after vaccination,” said Dr Frederick Ho, a lecturer in public health at the University of Glasgow, who was not involved in the research. “Even those people with mild symptoms who do not need to be hospitalised might have a small increase in the risk of [blood clots].” Although previous research had suggested that catching Covid was associated with an increased risk of blood clots, it was unclear for how long this risk remained, and whether mild infections also increased people’s risk. To address these uncertainties, Anne-Marie Fors Connolly at Umeå University in Sweden and her colleagues measured the risk of DVT, pulmonary embolism – a blood clot on the lung – and various types of bleeding, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or a burst blood vessel in the brain, in more than 1 million people with confirmed Covid infections and more than 4 million uninfected individuals. Overall, they identified a 33-fold increase in the risk of pulmonary embolism, a fivefold increase in the risk of DVT and an almost twofold increase in the risk of bleeding in the 30 days after infection. People remained at increased risk of pulmonary embolism for six months after becoming infected, and for two and three months for bleeding and DVT. Although the risks were highest in patients with more severe illness, even those with mild Covid had a threefold increased risk of DVT and a sevenfold increased risk of pulmonary embolism. No increased risk of bleeding was found in those who experienced mild infections. “Pulmonary embolism can be fatal, so it is important to be aware [of this risk],” said Connolly. “If you suddenly find yourself short of breath, and it doesn’t pass, [and] you’ve been infected with the coronavirus, then it might be an idea to seek help, because we find this increased risk for up to six months.” Ho said the results remained relevant even in the Omicron era, since current vaccines were highly effective against severe Covid but breakthrough infections were common, even after a third dose of a vaccine. “Despite the potential for new variants of concern, most governments are removing restrictions and shifting their focus to determining how best to live with Covid. This study reminds us of the need to remain vigilant to the complications associated with even mild Sars-CoV-2 infection, including [blood clots].”",News/World news,Covid linked to 33-fold increase in risk of pulmonary embolism,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/06/covid-linked-33-fold-increase-risk-pulmonary-embolism-dvt
