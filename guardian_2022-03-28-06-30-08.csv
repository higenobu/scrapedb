3/28/2022,"The series got its swagger back in the nick of time. Here’s your breakdown of the penultimate ever episode, The Road to Hell … After last week’s shattering diagnosis of an inoperable brain tumour, Thomas Shelby OBE MP (Cillian Murphy) had nothing to lose. His in-built deadline had given the conflicted gang boss renewed purpose. He spent this propulsive episode striding from meeting to meeting, taking care of business. The show roared back to form in his newly turbo-charged wake. First stop was Chinatown, where, with the aid of a ticking briefcase bomb (where’s Vicky McClure’s “Expo” team when you need them?), he instructed the Chinese cafes to stop selling opium or he would have the entire neighbourhood demolished. By order of the Peaky Blinders? Nope, “by order of the Birmingham urban district council”. Neatly done – but not as neat as Tommy’s timing, as he dropped the bomb into the canal with seconds to spare. Pause … wait for it … ka-boom. Not a real bomb, you say? An explosive return to form, only five minutes in. Next came a clan meeting in the Garrison Tavern over a full Shelby breakfast (Irish whiskey and cigarettes, obviously). Fans had been wondering where on earth the youngest sibling, Finn (Harry Kirton), had got to, since he has been only fleetingly sighted this series. Now, we found out – marrying his sweetheart, Mary (Abbie Hern). Finn still didn’t get any dialogue, though. Perhaps wedlock has worn out his vocal cords. Main item on the agenda? The introduction of Tommy’s long-lost son, Erasmus, AKA Duke (Conrad Khan). Tommy’s wife, Lizzie (Natasha O’Keeffe), simmered with fury about their deceased daughter, Ruby, seemingly being replaced so swiftly. Cracks between the couple are widening, not least because Tommy hasn’t told her about his plans – or even his health condition. As for Duke, he doesn’t drink, read or write, but he does pick pockets. “We’ll need Curly and a strong rope to break this one in,” noted Arthur (Paul Anderson), approvingly. Duke didn’t take to working in the betting shop – too many people, too much violence – so Tommy sorted him a job at the salvage yard. “I have a future for you, Duke,” said Tommy, understandably preoccupied with his own legacy. Someday, Duke will take care of the dark side of the family business, Tommy’s younger son George the light side. Until then, keep a close eye on your wallet and watch. In an effort to get his big brother straightened out, Tommy had been in correspondence with Arthur’s estranged wife, Linda (a welcome return for Kate Phillips). Now, he made her an offer she couldn’t refuse – a donation of £10,000 to her Quaker missionary foundation in return for reconciling with Arthur. Deal. She was willing only to help Arthur down the road to redemption, not sleep with him, but Blinders can’t be choosers. Linda came back and led Arthur through a prayer, although the devout doofus barely managed to stop himself swearing. A-fookin’-men. Tommy’s packed schedule continued with a visit to Liverpool docks and union convenor Hayden Stagg (Stephen Graham). He paid Stagg for the “care he took” over Arthur’s comradely addiction pep talk, but reminded him he was still due a beating for stealing from the opium stash. Fearless Stagg barely batted an eyelid. More pressingly, there was business to be done. A shipment of submachine guns was arriving for the IRA. Stagg would unload and store them. He was handed a bullet with his name on it, just to keep him in line. Now that Tommy was dealing with Boston, he was considering rerouting his supply line through Liverpool, rather than Belfast. Such a shift had the potential to make Stagg a rich man. He took this news with his usual stoic stillness, noting that Tommy was “an ordinary, mortal man” – echoing his own words from last week. Stagg possesses the uncanny ability to see inside the Shelbys’ heads. He’s magic, that Stephen Graham. But is Stagg a powder keg waiting to blow? On the promise of securing the Guinness Trust’s support for charitable housing along the canal, Tommy met Diana Mitford (Amber Anderson) on his family’s old narrowboat in Solihull. The toxic toff had been making eyes at him all series and now made her lascivious intent clear: “Oswald has fucked your wife … It would be only fair.” Well, since you put it like that. They took her chauffeur-driven Rolls to a nearby hotel, complete with purple bedsheets, for passionate sex that contrasted starkly with Tommy’s more perfunctory marital duties with Lizzie. Anyone else reminded of Ada quipping “Tommy Shelby is going to stop the revolution with his cock” two series ago? Mitford said it sealed their political alliance (“the English aristocracy’s way of shaking hands”), but spitefully used it as leverage to lord it over Lizzie. When drunken, brash east-coast crime kingpin Jack Nelson (James Frecheville) dined with the Shelbys en route to catch his steamer home, Mitford and Oswald Mosley (Sam Claflin) gatecrashed to say their goodbyes. Nelson, a presidential envoy, had been reassured of fascism’s rise across Europe, building bridges from Washington to Berlin, via Dublin, London and Rome. The two-week visit had changed the course of history, boasted Mosley. When Mitford gloated that she had “sampled” Tommy, Lizzie left the table, humiliated, but with her dignity intact. Poor bab. I would love to see her sock Mitford on the nose before the series is out. The vile couple told Tommy that Lizzie’s past meant she wasn’t a suitable wife. To his credit, he defended her, replying that she doesn’t deserve a man who consorts with “fuckers like you”. Well said, but his marriage still looks in jeopardy. So does his life. Tommy is heading to Canada to collect the $5m payment for his opium shipment. But don’t worry; cousin Michael (Finn Cole) “will be there to watch his back”. With friends like these … At last, Finn spoke – bringing Arthur a problem about a football referee who refused to match-fix. When they summoned the reluctant whistleblower for a spot of intimidation, he didn’t bow to pressure. Trying not to bloody his hands, Bible-bashing Arthur bullied the former footballer Billy Grade (the luxuriantly bearded Emmett J Scanlan, another first-time appearance this series) into garrotting him. With the resulting arterial spray, Billy was blooded as a Blinder. While a shaken, naked Billy washed off the evidence at the local baths, he received an eye-watering visit from Nelson – who was also handy with a garotte, only preferring to aim lower. He knew Billy used to be an informant – likely the “black cat” traitor who leaked the assassination attempt on Mosley. On pain of losing his unmentionables, Grade grassed for Jack. The Americans planned to kill Tommy. It was Billy’s job to give up Arthur. This was our first real glimpse of Nelson’s ruthlessness, leaving things tantalisingly poised for next week. What’s more, Nelson had just the man to do the deed. In the closing scene, vengeful Michael was visited in jail by a priest with a question. “The grey man” in his prison scrubs answered in the affirmative: “When I’m released, it is my intention to kill Tommy Shelby.” As his mother, Polly (flashbacks of the mighty Helen McCrory), foretold: “There will be a war in this family and one of them will die.” Not long until we find out which. “It would be nice if just one thing could happen in Birmingham that wasn’t our fault.” Ada, have you learned nothing these past six series? The show was back to its strutting, stylised best with that opening sequence set to Lawman by the Irish punks Gilla Band. Other belters included Marilyn Monroe’s One Silver Dollar, soundtracking Mitford’s arrival at the barge, and Thom Yorke’s Unmade during Tommy’s hallucination. But the tune of the week was undoubtedly Patti Smith’s bravura cover of Red Right Hand, recorded specially for the show. Last week’s gunned-down Gypsy curser Evadne Barwell (Gwynne McElveen) was atop the pile of people Tommy killed. Did you recognise any others? As well as Tommy guns, Thompson submachine guns were nicknamed Chicago typewriters, due to their use by Prohibition-era mobsters. They were indeed shipped to the IRA via Liverpool. Birmingham City only won 1-0 at home on two occasions in 1934 – against Blackburn in the league and Charlton in the FA Cup. I wonder if either was the rigged match in question. Next Sunday’s feature-length finale clocks in at 81 minutes. “We were like, fuck the 10 O’Clock news,” says the director, Anthony Byrne. “It’s such a Peaky thing to do for the last hurrah. It’s the 10.22 news for one night only.”​ The end is nigh.

3/28/2022,"Adam Kinzinger, one of two Republican members on January 6 committee, on Sunday vowed to “get to the bottom” of events surrounding the 2021 insurrection at the US Capitol but refused to reveal whether the panel intends to question Ginni Thomas – wife of US supreme court justice Clarence Thomas – over reports of her urging the White House to overturn Donald Trump’s election defeat. Senior Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar said Clarence Thomas must recuse himself from relevant cases and warned the integrity of the supreme court is at stake. Kinzinger refused to confirm or deny the existence of text messages Ginni Thomas is reported to have exchanged with then White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, although he did not contest the Washington Post and CBS’s joint revelation last week that they obtained copies of such messages from materials submitted to the congressional committee by Meadows. “The question for the committee in this or any exchange is ‘was there a conspiracy, or how close did we get to overturning the election?’” he told CBS’s Face the Nation show on Sunday. Kinzinger, one of two Republicans on the House select committee investigating the events surrounding 6 January 2021, said of witnesses being summoned to give evidence to the committee: “We’ll call in whoever we need to call in.” He added: “Was there an effort to overturn the legitimate election of the United States? What was January 6 in relation to that? And what is the rot in our system that led to that and does it still exist today?…We are going to get to the bottom of this.” He did not say whether that “rot” extended to the nation’s highest court. Thomas and her husband are rightwing political darlings who have described themselves as “one being – an amalgam,” according to the New York Times. Amid the latest reports, Justice Thomas is now facing calls to recuse himself from any cases surrounding the 2020 presidential election, the insurrection and potentially the 2024 presidential election, should Trump run for re-election. Meanwhile Klobuchar of Minnesota, chairwoman of the Senate rules committee and a member of the Senate judiciary committee, which quizzes nominees for the supreme court, demanded that Clarence Thomas be removed from any such cases. “This is unbelievable,” Klobuchar told ABC’s This Week. “You have the wife of a sitting supreme court justice advocating for an insurrection, advocating for overturning a legal election, to the sitting president’s chief of staff. And she also knows this election, these cases, are going to come before her husband. This is a textbook case for removing him, recusing him, from these decisions.” The 29 exchanges reported between Ginni Thomas and Meadows reveal how the wife of one of the land’s top jurists disseminated disinformation related to the QAnon conspiracy theory and other inaccurate arguments during the tempestuous days following the November 2020 election when right-wingers were claiming Democrat Joe Biden had not won. Even as Trump strategized efforts to overturn his defeat through the courts, Virginia “Ginni” Thomas “spread false theories, commented on cable news segments and advocated with urgency and fervor that the president and his team take action to reverse the outcome of the election,” the Post reported. It reported she wrote to Meadows: “Help This Great President stand firm, Mark!!!...You are the leader, with him, who is standing for America’s constitutional governance at the precipice. The majority knows Biden and the Left is attempting the greatest Heist of our History.” Pressed about how he and his colleagues would broach Thomas’s alleged attempts to undermine a legitimate US election, Kinzinger said they want to ensure their work is “not driven by a political motivation, it’s driven by facts”. The House select committee has so far hesitated to demand cooperation from Thomas in part because they are worried she may “create a political spectacle to distract from the investigation”, the Guardian previously reported. Klobuchar said: “All I hear is silence from the supreme court right now. And that better change in the coming week because every other federal judge in the country except supreme court justices would have guidance from ethics rules that says you got to recuse. The entire integrity of the court is on the line here.”",News/US news,Republican won’t say whether Capitol attack panel will question Ginni Thomas,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/27/ginni-thomas-texts-adam-kinzinger-republican-capitol-attack-panel
