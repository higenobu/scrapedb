1/25/2022,"Tom Holland was obsessed with Spider-Man as a boy. Growing up in Kingston upon Thames, he came to own more than 30 Spider-Man costumes and cherished his Spider-Man bedsheets. And, unlike for most, his childhood obsession paid dividends later in life: he would eventually get to play his hero, landing the role that has made him the most famous young British actor in the world.  Holland, 25, has been at the centre of Marvel’s cinematic universe for years. After making his debut in Captain America: Civil War in 2016, he has starred in two Avengers and three standalone Spider-Man films. The latest, No Way Home, has so far grossed more than $1.6bn (£1.18bn) worldwide, and Holland is now one of a small handful of Hollywood big-hitters being touted by some to be the next host of the Oscars – the event’s first formal presenter in three years. The actor’s cheeky British charm, vulnerability and wit have made him one of the internet’s favourite crushes. Whether he’s accidentally spoiling the latest Marvel movie, mispronouncing “croissant” or adopting a chicken after supermarkets ran out of eggs, he has a knack for making audiences laugh and warming their hearts. But his ascent to Hollywood superstardom was not always a given. In fact, his roots lie not in drama schools or small acting roles but in gymnastics and dance, something the young Holland fell into almost accidentally. The eldest of four brothers, Holland credits his interest in dancing to the music of Janet Jackson. His dad, Dominic, a standup comedian and author, and his mum, Nikki, a professional photographer, noticed their son’s natural rhythm and signed him up to hip-hop classes at Nifty Feet dance school, run by the choreographer Lynne Page in a leisure centre in Wimbledon. During a performance one Easter, a 10-year-old Holland was spotted by a member of the Royal Ballet school and asked to audition for Billy Elliot the Musical, then on at London’s Victoria Palace theatre. In his book Eclipsed, Dominic Holland, who later became his son’s unofficial manager and agent, recalls taking Tom to see the musical and laughing at the preposterousness of him playing Billy. “There was just no way. No chance. Ballet, tap, singing, acting; Tom had never done any of these things. He had never even been cast in any of his school plays.” Despite his lack of experience, Tom still caught the eye of the director, Stephen Daldry, because “he could see that Tom could act and, even more crucially, that he could take direction”, his father wrote. After two years of preparation, including ballet, tap and acrobatic lessons, Holland was finally on stage – first as Michael, Billy’s friend, and then as Billy in 2008. Craig Gallivan, who played Tony in the musical, said it was clear from the very first rehearsals that Holland was special. “The children I was lucky enough work with on Billy Elliot were all exceptional talents so it was something of an impossibility to stand out from that, but Tom did,” he said. “For me, it was his connection to the dialogue. He had access to an emotional sensitivity that was way beyond his years.” Holland’s turn as Billy Elliot would transpire to be more consequential than he and his family would ever have imagined. JA Bayona, the director of The Impossible, Holland’s first feature film, in which he starred alongside Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts, was originally struck by the young actor when he saw a video of him discussing Billy. The German actor Sönke Möhring, who starred alongside Holland in the 2012 film, said it was “amazing to see how professional he was”. He said: “Besides his great talent he is blessed with a deep soul. You could feel that he was more connected with the story than other actors of his age. Most of all, he was down to earth, very polite and a friendly kid.” It was around the same time that Holland was cast in Kevin Macdonald’s How I Live Now. Macdonald, the Oscar-winning director behind One Day in September and The Last King of Scotland, said it was “a beautiful experience” working with the then teenager. “He’d done Billy Elliot, so he had this confidence with having been on stage in front of thousands of people night after night. When you’re meeting teenagers, they’re mostly crippled by shyness. But he was articulate and enthusiastic.” For Macdonald, this positive energy helped to make Holland a star. “It’s lovely to be around. He’s so bright-eyed.” But if his personality was what drew directors to him, it was the physical agility he developed as a result of playing Billy that kept them there. And none were more keen than the Captain America: Civil War directors, Joe and Anthony Russo. According to the Captain America star Chris Evans, who met his future co-star during the Spider-Man audition process, Holland ended up doing a flip during a scene. “Marvel doesn’t want to see this kid break his neck, so everyone from the studio was like: ‘Don’t! Don’t!’ And Joe just started salivating: ‘Just do it!’ And he did it – and stuck it,” Evans said. When Holland was cast as Spider-Man in 2015, he beat thousands of other young actors to the role, including Asa Butterfield and Timothée Chalamet. Critics have consistently praised his performances, and a campaign to get No Way Home Oscar recognition is gaining traction. Holland himself is an arch-defender of the artistic merits of the Marvel films. When Martin Scorsese likened the franchise to “theme parks”, he hit back, saying: “I’ve made Marvel movies and I’ve also made movies that have been in the conversation in the world of the Oscars, and the only difference, really, is one is much more expensive than the other.” Beyond the set, he has said that having Zendaya – another precocious actor, who plays Spider-Man’s onscreen love interest – in his life has kept him sane. The pair’s relationship has long obsessed fans, with videos such as “Tom Holland and Zendaya flirting for 8 minutes straight” racking up more than 1.8m views on YouTube. Last summer, when pictures emerged of the two kissing, Spider-Man fandom was sent into a frenzy. To Holland it was an invasion of privacy, to critics a publicity stunt, and to fans a dream come true. Holland, who has spoken about the huge responsibility that comes with playing Spider-Man, has a host of upcoming projects, including Uncharted (based on the video game series) and the Apple TV drama The Crowded Room. But of late he’s been more vocal about his desire to branch out into directing and return to dancing. “The 20-year goal is to be a film director,” he told Interview magazine in 2017. “The 15-year goal is to win an Oscar.” Whether or not he has the chance to triumph at this year’s awards is yet to be seen. But to his millions of fans, he’s already a winner.",Arts/Film,From Billy Elliot to Spider-Man: how Tom Holland won the world’s heart,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/24/tom-holland-actor-billy-elliot-to-spider-man
1/25/2022,"A police force left residents “in danger, at risk and unprotected” for a “protracted period” during a riot in which cars were set on fire and bricks were hurled at houses, leaving people fearing for their lives, an independent review has concluded. The chief constable of South Wales police, Jeremy Vaughan, apologised that his force had failed to act quickly enough during the disturbance in Swansea and accepted residents had been “tormented” by the rioters.  The independent review of the Mayhill disturbance, which happened in May 2021, highlighted that scores of officers were in the area but stood by, rather than tackling the rioters. It also said that one officer in charge that night twice asked for extra police to be scrambled from other areas as backup but was refused. It highlighted one example of a vulnerable person whose life was feared to be in danger. Officers with shields were deployed but withdrew for their own safety, leaving the person and others like him “lost”, the report said. It concluded: “Significant failings are evident. Currently available evidence strongly suggests failings in command structures and decisions, operational decisions and tactics, and communications.” There were 46 arrests over the disturbance and the charging decisions by the Crown Prosecution Service on 37 people allegedly involved are expected imminently. Vaughan said: “I want to apologise to all those who have been affected by this incident and particularly those local residents who were tormented by those responsible. We failed to take action quickly enough on the night and for that I am truly sorry.” The review, undertaken by a former senior police officer, an ex-council chief executive and a barrister, said the impact of Covid lockdowns may have been one of the catalysts for the disturbance. It said: “The adverse effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and consequent lockdowns have been identified throughout our engagements: these include impact upon the public and communities, disproportionate impact on children and young people, on policing, on the council’s work and engagements and upon partnership working between agencies.” But it added: “However, no one has suggested to us that Covid was the sole or primary cause of the events.” It calls for investment in the area – one of the most deprived in Wales – such as safe spaces, community activity and youth engagement, adding: “Identifying, supporting, and nurturing community capacity to generate positive action in sport, community events, social activity, youth engagement, etc. is a significant challenge, but an essential one.” But the role of the police is the main focus of the report. “There was a protracted period during which the residents of Waun Wen Road [the centre of the violence] were in danger, at risk and unprotected by the police,” it said. “Some of the views shared with us include the following: ‘The police let us down’, ‘they failed to protect us’, ‘they weren’t there for us when we needed them,’ and ‘we don’t understand why they didn’t do anything’. The report says that up to 60 officers were on the streets, including some equipped with Tasers and with dogs, and that residents could not understand why they did not intervene. It said: “We have been unable to identify a clear command structure either properly identified or working in practice.” The panel expressed concern over why a request for reinforcements under the force’s Operation Scorpion plan was twice refused. “There appear to have been breakdowns in communications that night,” the report said. Examining the buildup, the panel said police had told it a vehicle had been obtained in advance, with a view to using it in the trouble. There was also a car chase involving the police shortly beforehand. Swansea council said it was investing in the area, such as improving facilities for young people. “We will be further boosting our youth services and facilities in this area as part of our ongoing investment in our young people,” a spokesperson said.",News/UK news,South Wales police left residents ‘unprotected’ during Swansea riot,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/24/south-wales-police-left-residents-unprotected-during-swansea-riot-mayhill
1/25/2022,"I wrote the song in 1979 when I was 21, living in Northamptonshire and playing in the punk band Riff Raff. I was coming back from the pub one night and saw two satellites in the sky. I thought they were a great metaphor for a relationship, so when I got home I wrote down: “I saw two shooting stars last night / I wished on them but they were only satellites.” When I came back to the song the following year to finish it, I realised I could truthfully open it with the line, “I was 21 years when I wrote this song / I’m 22 now but I won’t be for long”, just like Simon and Garfunkel’s Leaves That Are Green.  By 1980, Margaret Thatcher had been elected, the band had broken up and punk had dissipated into synthesiser groups, so A New England was my way of saying that I needed a hug as well as a new ideology. The line “the girls I loved in school are already pushing prams” was about my cohort. We’d all left school at 16 and were looking for different ways to become adults. As a singer-songwriter, I played electric guitar because if I had played an acoustic, the rock clubs would have sent me to the folk clubs. If audiences heckled, I could just turn it up. A New England is like a Ramones song: all bar chords on the bottom two strings. The quiet bit before the solo, where I dampen the strings with the bottom of my hand for a chugging sound, was a technique I borrowed from Thin Lizzy. Jeff Chegwin - TV presenter Keith’s twin – read a review of my tape in Melody Maker and gave me some studio time. He worked at music publisher Chappell and was the first person to show faith in me. When the resulting album, Life’s a Riot With Spy vs Spy, came out, I left a copy at the BBC. That evening, Jeff and I were playing football in Hyde Park and afterwards we stood around a car listening to the radio. John Peel came on Radio 1 during Kid Jensen’s slot and asked if someone could bring him a mushroom biryani before his show later. Fifteen minutes later, me and Jeff were at Broadcasting House, still in our football gear, with a mushroom biryani. I told John that I’d left a record. Later that night, I tuned in and heard him say: “I’d have done this without the mushroom biryani.” Then he played The Milkman of Human Kindness and I was away. A couple of years later, when Kirsty MacColl said she wanted to record A New England, she said she would need the genders changing and an extra verse. She invited me round for a fried breakfast and by the time she’d cooked it, I’d written the extra verse. Her shimmering pop version took it into the Top 10. I think it’s better than mine. I was the in-house engineer at Chappell, where I would record songwriters trying to sell their songs to publishers. Billy was initially booked in for a day to see how he got on. I didn’t really get what he was about and waved goodbye in the corridor thinking: “What a nice bloke. Shame he’ll never make it.” Then Jeff took me to see him playing in a pub, and that made all the difference. Billy could stand on stage, make people laugh, tell a story and turn it into the introduction of the song. In those days, everything was becoming more about high production values, so to see a guy doing it raw and live with just an electric guitar was very different. I had an idea how I could record him. We recorded Life’s a Riot in three days. We spent the first day getting a good sound using various delays and the studio’s very old-fashioned plate reverb on the vocals. Once we’d got that, he could run through the repertoire, do take after take and we’d pick the best at the end. Billy was rough round the edges but to me, A New England, Richard and The Milkman of Human Kindness were really standout songs. A New England took a handful of takes, and not long after, Life’s a Riot started selling in enormous quantities. I wasn’t due any royalties from the record but Billy, bless him, turned up at Chappell’s offices with a cheque saying: “I thought you deserved something.”  A new vinyl edition of Billy Bragg’s recent album The Million Things That Never Happened is released on 4 February. Riff Raff play a one-off reunion gig at Dingwalls, London, on 8 February, for guitarist Wiggy’s 60th birthday.",Arts/Culture,How we made: Billy Bragg’s A New England,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/24/how-we-made-billy-braggs-a-new-england-john-peel-biryani
1/25/2022,"“It’s life itself.” On Friday afternoon Diego Simeone said Atlético Madrid hadn’t been through anything like this in the years he had been there. That’s how bad things had got. The very next day they went through something they hadn’t experienced in the 118 years anyone had been there. That’s how good it got, how much they had needed this. “Madness,” Ángel Correa called it. “Incredible,” José María Giménez offered. It was “unbelievably beautiful,” Matheus Cunha said. It was also a timely reminder of who they are. At least, they hoped so. “What did you feel?” Simeone was asked when it was over, everyone exhausted but alive again, the final whistle coming on 100.51 with Atlético having somehow beaten Valencia 3-2 at the Metropolitano, the club’s anthem belted out like an act of faith. “What did I feel? Pfff. That this place is wonderful where I am. And every time you see it getting away, ah, I want to reach out and grab it even tighter.” They certainly have to hold on to something, and maybe this was it. “There are nights that stay with you; this is one,” Simeone said.  This was “D Day: origin of evil”, AS had claimed on Saturday morning, and it had been set to be a disaster. Three days earlier the same paper declared Atlético had hit “rock bottom” but they hadn’t stopped yet. In a week they had been beaten by Athletic in the Super Cup and deservedly knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Real Sociedad. Beaten four times in December, they had collected four of 18 points and started the weekend 16 behind Real Madrid, their season over. Now, on a night of “barbaric cold,” in Giménez’s words, they were losing again. Atlético were 2-0 down to the team who had most exposed their vulnerability, coming back from 3-1 down to draw 3-3 with two goals in added time in November, foreshadowing their fall. Three teams were lined up to take a Champions League place off them and two more could climb to within a point. But it wasn’t just that; it was that, by Simeone’s own admission, they had done “absolutely nothing” they wanted. When Yunus Musah scored the first, it was the 25th league goal Atlético had conceded – as many as in the whole of last season, no longer good at the things that defined them. It was nicely taken; it was also dreadfully defended, and still it wasn’t as bad the second, scored by Hugo Duro and assisted by half the Atlético team. “My heart hurt,” Simeone said. There was, he admitted, “desperation, anxiety, sadness about what was happening to us”, not least because it had happened before. At half time he told his players that they could lose, but not like this. Ultimately, they didn’t lose at all. Correa came on at the break, Cunha was introduced 12 minutes later for Lemar, and centre-back Felipe replaced João Félix. That decision drew whistles, but it worked. “In the second half I could see something I identify with,” Simeone said. Cunha scored the first after an hour but going into the last minute Atlético were still losing 2-1. They had never won a league game from that position. Now, they did. On 89.58, Correa made it 2-2, dashing into the net to get the ball back. On 92.13, Mario Hermoso made it 3-2. Between the equaliser and the winner, the ball had only been in play 46 seconds. Now suddenly, Luis Suárez was leaping on to Hermoso’s back, crashing to the ground, teammates chasing. From the touchline they came too, 11 men sprinting towards the south end. In the leading pack, Simeone was flat out. From the tunnel came Antoine Griezmann, injured and unavailable but moving fast, leaping into them and almost sending Simeone to the turf. As he headed back towards the bench, Simeone’s head lolled and his legs gave way, looking to the sky about to cry like a marathon runner approaching the line, nothing left. He paused, put his hands on his knees and spat, as if post-puke, a portrait of the pressure. There were eight more minutes to endure: when the final whistle went, for once Simeone didn’t sprint straight up the tunnel. Instead, Valencia’s players were first, one booting the wall, a miracle he didn’t break his foot. “This can’t happen; we have to defend tooth and nail,” Duro said. His teammates said worse things, if they said anything. Another sat on the stairs alone, silently waiting for an opponent’s shirt. By the time he arrived, he had given it away. Five-goal thriller ends in an epic @atletienglish comeback win... 🔴🔥⚪#AtletiValencia highlights ⤵️ pic.twitter.com/d2zqr8d87U They all had. Simeone had embraced them all, leaping into Lemar, strangling Suárez, leading them towards the fans to throw their shirts into the stands. “Any other fans would have turned against us,” Simeone said. Can you explain what that felt like, Cunha was asked. “No,” he said and started laughing. “To be honest, no.” It is not the only thing that evades easy explanation; the whole season does, that Atlético again found themselves needing to come from behind, why their title defence ended so fast. The hope now is that this can be a turning point – a phrase just about everyone used afterwards. “I’m convinced,” Correa said. “We needed this.” Hermoso added: “It’s been difficult since the [last] Valencia game; what better day to turn it around?” “The first half is not us, the second is,” Simeone said, which was partly the point: too often that first half has been them. This is a recurring theme, a question of identity: who they are, what they want to be and how. Asked why this Atlético is not Atlético, there was something pointed in his response: “Maybe the coach doesn’t clearly individualise which players can transmit what we saw in the second half. [He has] to identify those who can do that.” This season Yannick Carrasco – fabulous on Saturday – has started 18 of 21 games. Hermoso has too, in different roles. Koke, left out recently, has started 16. No one else is over 14. One of them, Marcos Llorente, has not had a defined role. Another, Suárez, has not scored since the Valencia game, often withdrawn early and increasingly often not starting. Stefan Savic has been injured and missed. So too Giménez. Griezmann needs accommodating. Correa somehow never quite feels like an automatic first choice. “When they score the second goal you start to think: ‘why is this happening to us?’” Correa admitted. So why is it? “I don’t know,” he replied. “I couldn’t explain it to you, but it’s a reality.” Sometimes the margins are fine: expected goals, for and against, suggest Atlético shouldn’t have dropped so many points. Even Jan Oblak has looked normal, not the saviour he was. But chance is an unsatisfactory explanation even when it does play a part, which it always does. Last year too, Atlético had been forced into rescuing results in an extraordinary run in, but they did win the league. And maybe that’s part of it too. Success shifts things, shaping expectation, mind-sets, group dynamics, altering or even eliminating the sense of resistance or rebellion, of collective cause. Signings do too. Administering abundance is not the same, creating different challenges. Who are they? The league champions, supposedly the best squad Atlético have ever had. “For a team like Atlético it’s not easy to be champions; it’s a club not used to being champions every year,” Simeone said. “They were champions after 25 years [actually 22, from 1977 to 1996]. We took it to 18 [between 1996 to 2014], then seven [from 2014 to last season]. You have to maintain that [trend] and it takes a lot to do that. You have to prove yourself daily; nothing you did before counts; what counts is what lies ahead. That has to be a lesson to teach for me and the players to the path now.” Espanyol 1-4 Real Betis, Atlético Madrid 3-2 Valencia, Sevilla 2-2 Celta Vigo, Villarreal 3-0 Real Mallorca, Levante 0-2 Cádiz, Alavés 0-1 Barcelona, Real Sociedad 0-0 Getafe, Rayo Vallecano 0-1 Athletic Bilbao, Real Madrid 2-2 Elche, Granada 0-2 Osasuna “When you win the league, lots of teams relax because they say ‘well, it’s happened’,” Giménez said. “Four new players came and the team relaxes a bit. You think that if they score, no worries, you have players who can win it for you [still], and that was a bit what happened to us. Last season, games started and we would bite. This year, I see a slight relaxation in comparison. We were first to the challenges, the loose balls, we were aggressive in the areas, we defended games to the end. This year, that wasn’t happening. Why? Because we have a great team, but a great team is built on results too. “Today, it did: hopefully this can be the push we need to be better,” Giménez added, “but you have to believe it: you can’t say ‘done’, next week we win just with the shirt. This is a turning point we have to grab. In the end, what you need is a win. What you need is this. If you play like you always played, like Atlético Madrid, you can win any game.”",Sport/Football,Atlético revel in ‘madness’ of wildest win yet – but will it be a turning point? | Sid Lowe,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/24/atletico-revel-in-madness-of-wildest-win-yet-but-will-it-be-a-turning-point
1/25/2022,"The RSPB has called for an emergency shooting ban after an “unprecedented” outbreak of bird flu that has left wildfowl populations in “catastrophic decline”. Migratory geese that overwinter on the Solway Firth, which stretches between Scotland and Cumbria, are being hardest hit, with a 38% decline in the Svalbard barnacle goose breeding population from winter last year.  While these are protected species and not subject to hunting, experts argue that pressure from wildfowlers on nearby, legal quarry species can have an impact. Shoots nearby can cause stress, scaring the birds into the air where they use up vital energy. Some estimates suggest the UK is facing the worst outbreak of avian influenza on record. Latest population counts of the Svalbard breeding population show a drop in numbers from 43,703 in November last year to 27,133 in this month’s counts. Paul Walton, the head of habitats and species at RSPB Scotland, said: “We are in the grip of an unprecedented outbreak and unfortunately the Solway seems to be the epicentre of this in the UK. Our birds are suffering and they need an urgent reprieve to help them get through this winter and ensure that as many as possible of those remaining survive to make their migration back home to Scandinavia to breed in the summer. “The best way we can do this is by reducing the cumulative impacts of disturbance, including by wildfowling. Our teams on the ground are seeing many birds that are sick or dying and under significant stress. Anything that can be done to limit activities which incur additional disturbance at this time should be implemented with urgency. This action could help these populations during this period of catastrophic decline caused by the outbreak.” There are allowances under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 for a temporary pause in the hunting of wildfowl if there are prolonged periods of freezing weather. The RSPB is asking for this consideration in the event of a severe avian influenza outbreak. It has also asked the public to keep dogs under close control in the Solway coastal area to avoid further disturbing the birds. After the barnacle goose gained protection in the 1950s, following a long campaign by conservationists, the world population rose from just a few hundred individuals to about 40,000. But the recent sharp decline has made experts concerned the good work could be undone. Wild birds migrating to the UK from mainland Europe during the winter months can carry bird flu. Many bird populations, from chickens to swans, have been hit by the flu, which is deadly. An avian influenza prevention zone came into force across Great Britain on 3 November, meaning birdkeepers must keep their flock separate from wild birds and put strict biosecurity measures in place. Anyone who finds dead birds is advised not to handle them and to report the bodies to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.",News/Environment,RSPB calls for emergency shooting ban during bird flu outbreak,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/24/rspb-calls-for-emergency-shooting-ban-during-bird-flu-outbreak
1/25/2022,"Colm Tóibín has been named as the new laureate for Irish fiction, taking over from Sebastian Barry. The three-year role is intended to “acknowledge the contribution of fiction writers to Irish artistic and cultural life”, as well as to encourage new writers, and engagement with “high quality Irish fiction”.  The Arts Council of Ireland, which runs the initiative, described Tóibín as “one of our finest writers”, whose award-winning novels – from The Master to Brooklyn – “are not just acclaimed by critics but they are also loved by readers”. Eleanor Wachtel, a Canadian critic who sat on the selection panel for the role, said that Tóibín was “a true man of letters”. “I’ve been following Colm Tóibín’s work for almost 30 years and have long admired his intelligence, erudition, wit and compassion,” she added. “From his thoughtful essays to his engaging fiction, he’s remarkably talented and prolific, full of warmth and enthusiasm.” Tóibín said he was “honoured” to be appointed to a role which was first filled by Anne Enright, and then by Barry. “I will do what I can to work with a community of readers so that fiction continues to enrich our lives, allow us to see the world more clearly, or with a deepened sense of mystery,” said the author. “I will also work with fellow writers and aspiring writers to enhance the role novels and stories play in Irish life.” He will begin his role with a monthly book club, The Art of Reading, in which he will discuss “outstanding” Irish writing, sometimes interviewing the authors of the books he is discussing. The event, which will be offered online on the last Thursday of every month, kicks off on 24 February, when Tóibín will be talking to Claire Keegan about her recent book Small Things Like These. It is, said Tóibín, “quite an exciting time to be a reader in Ireland”. “It is as though here in Ireland there’s still things to be said that no one has worked out a way to say yet, and it is as though writers are putting up flags, and big flags, over a place, over a sensibility, or over a story that has not yet been told or else needs a new version.”",Arts/Books,Colm Tóibín is named new Irish fiction laureate in ‘exciting time to be a reader in Ireland’,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/24/colm-toibin-irish-fiction-laureate
1/25/2022,"You must remember Thomas Gainsborough’s Blue Boy. It’s the painting that gets stolen from a rich man’s house in the 1929 Laurel and Hardy short Wrong Again. Trying to claim the reward, Stan and Ollie fetch a racehorse called Blue Boy instead and attempt to “leave it on the piano” as they were asked. If only the National Gallery screened this in their tiny exhibition to mark The Blue Boy’s return to Britain for the first time in a century, we might get a sense of what it once meant. In 1921 railway magnate Henry E Huntingdon bought this 1770 painting for a world record price, making it as famous in 1920s America as Banksy is now. Perhaps The Blue Boy even inspired pop art, for it injected glamour into jazz age Hollywood. But that was then.  This glittering dazzle of blue and silver with a bonny face on top has come home far too late. Shown with two other Gainsboroughs and two portraits by his inspiration, Anthony van Dyck, it embodies a vision of English art that’s as hokey as a Disney cartoon of a fox hunt. It makes you wonder if as a nation, when it comes to art and the soul, we have something missing. I thought I loved Gainsborough’s virtuoso brushwork, like a bravura bit of Mozart or Haydn in paint, pleasing itself in molten chromatic fripperies. But staring too long at The Blue Boy is a good way to get fed up with his talent. This painting of an entitled, arrogant youth in a fancy dress costume has a country-house worth of technical magic but no soul. It surely appealed to people a century ago – including Americans who still emulated the English upper class – as a quintessentially English icon of snobbish disdain and style. Today it might stick in our throats for the same reason. But that is not, exactly, what is wrong with it. The craft of this show-off painting scintillates. You enter the small room where it is on display and are delighted by that burst of silvered azure. Whoever this adolescent was – the identity of the Blue Boy has never been established – Gainsborough turned him into precious artwork. He got him to dress in an archaic costume inspired by the cavaliers Van Dyck painted in the 1600s on the eve of the English civil war. Van Dyck, from Antwerp, created a definitive swaggering look for high-style English aristocratic portraiture. In Gainsborough’s day, when portraitists were vying for the custom of an elite enriched by the agricultural revolution, global trade and slavery, the Van Dyck manner was hot. So, in this tour de force of oil painting, Gainsborough takes on Van Dyck and out-primps him. Van Dyck’s portrait of Lord John Stuart and his Brother, Lord Bernard Stuart, painted about 1638, is hung for comparison. These two youths with expressions of ice-cold hauteur become a bit more sympathetic when you realise they would both shortly be killed in the civil war, probably while brushing their long hair. Lord Bernard Stuart wears a silver and blue cloak, blue pantaloons and fawn boots. He poses with one knee raised, hand on hip, looking down on us over his shoulder. Gainsborough’s youth wears a version of this very garb yet it is painted much more playfully. Van Dyck’s brushwork is meticulous. Gainsborough’s is rollicking. He lets loose glancing dazzles and dips of light and cool in every crease, riffs on each frolic of lace like a drunken flautist. He has great fun, riffing on ruffs. If that was enough to make a portrait great, this would be one of the greatest. However, it is not. The painting’s most brilliant visual coup is also the beginning of what it lacks. Gainsborough sets off the electric storm of blueness against a rainy English sky. As the Victorian critic Ruskin noted, Gainsborough’s weather is the most British thing about him. This sky is brown and brackish, laden with chilly moisture, a sublime bass note to contrast with the piping flute. It is a romantic landscape – one of the first. Yet Gainsborough does not use it romantically. He uses it for pure visual effect: the morose setting exaggerates the figure’s brightness. Instead of a solitary walker lost in landscape we get an overdressed cocksure kid looking right through us. Gainsborough sacrifices emotion for effect. The Blue Boy’s face doesn’t betray the least hint of introspection. In reality, the youth’s aristocratic demeanour may be a put-on. One possible candidate for the model is Gainsborough’s nephew and apprentice Gainsborough Dupont. That makes sense if, as I suspect, The Blue Boy is not a real portrait so much as a display piece Gainsborough kept in his studio to razzle-dazzle potential customers. It was painted when he had a portrait business in Bath. Gentlefolk staying at this spa town for the season could pose for him between playing cards at the Assembly Rooms and marrying off their daughters. Gainsborough called it “pickpocketing the rich”. And yes, he was happy to pickpocket people whose money came from slave plantations. To me The Blue Boy looks like his brilliant advert – today it might be a video he played for the client so they could see how he might transform them. That would explain why it has so much style and so little soul. Gainsborough could be so much better than this. And the National Gallery accidentally shows that by including one of his real masterpieces, Elizabeth and Mary Linley, which is a risky move if you want people to look at anything else in the room. Mary Linley returns your gaze with true feeling and intelligence while her sister looks into the landscape with Romantic feeling. This is how Gainsborough could paint people he really cared about – who usually tended to be women, or fellow creative workers. The musical Linleys were both. These paintings are keepers but The Blue Boy had me fidgeting after five minutes. It is as boring as it is impressive. It seems the art market a century ago was as silly as it is today. Gainsborough’s Blue Boy is at the National Gallery, London, from 25 January to 15 May.",Arts/Art and design,Gainsborough’s Blue Boy: a cocksure kid who looks right through you – review,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/24/gainsborough-blue-boy-a-cocksure-kid-who-looks-right-through-you-review
1/25/2022,"A woman in Michigan checked her spam email folder – and found out she had won a $3m lottery prize. “I saw an ad on Facebook that the Mega Millions jackpot was getting pretty high, so I got on my account and bought a ticket,” Laura Spears, 55 and from Oakland county, said in a release from the Michigan Lottery.  “A few days later, I was looking for a missing email from someone, so I checked the spam folder in my email account. “That’s when I saw an email from the lottery saying I had won a prize. I couldn’t believe what I was reading, so I logged in to my lottery account to confirm the message in the email.” “It’s all still so shocking to me that I really won $3m.” Spears in fact won $1m on her original ticket but had paid another $1 to add a “Megaplier”, a gambit the Michigan Lottery said can multiply prizes up to five times. Spears said she will retire earlier than planned, and will share her winnings with family members. She also said she had “added the Michigan Lottery to my safe senders list just in case I ever get lucky enough to receive another email about a huge prize”. The lottery operator was keen to emphasize that a huge prize is now on offer in the Mega Millions draw, which operates in 45 US states, Washington DC and the US Virgin Islands. “The Mega Millions jackpot was last won on 22 October 2021,” the operator said, “when a family in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, won $108m. The current jackpot stands at $376m.”",News/US news,Michigan woman checks spam folder and learns she won the lottery,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/24/woman-checks-spam-folder-learns-she-won-lottery
1/25/2022,"The head of the World Health Organization has warned member countries that the UN’s global health body is being “set up to fail” without a “paradigm shift” in the way that it is funded and supported. In stark language delivered to the WHO’s executive board, the organisation’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed more than 5.5 million lives, had underlined the need to strengthen health systems as well as pandemic preparedness plans.  Addressing the specific issue of Covid-19, Tedros also cautioned that conditions remained ideal for more variants to emerge. He said it was dangerous for countries to assume Omicron is the last variant or that “we are in the endgame”. “There are different scenarios for how the pandemic could play out and how the acute phase could end,” he said. “But it’s dangerous to assume that Omicron will be the last variant or that we are in the endgame,” he added. “On the contrary, globally, the conditions are ideal for more variants to emerge.” He insisted, however, that “we can end Covid-19 as a global health emergency, and we can do it this year,” by reaching goals such as the WHO’s target to vaccinate 70% of the population of each country by the middle of this year, with a focus on people who are at the highest risk of Covid-19. “It’s true that we will be living with Covid for the foreseeable future and that we will need to learn to manage it through a sustained and integrated system for acute respiratory diseases” to help prepare for future pandemics, he said. “But learning to live with Covid cannot mean that we give this virus a free ride. It cannot mean that we accept almost 50,000 deaths a week from a preventable and treatable disease.” In wide-ranging remarks on Monday, Tedros told members: “Covid-19 has proven that health is not just a national issue; it’s an international issue. The scale of challenges we face is immense, and is reflected by the breadth of your agenda this week.” Supporters say the WHO’s reliance on voluntary funding from member states and charities forces it to focus on priorities set by funders, and makes it less able to criticise members when things go wrong. A proposal by the WHO’s working group on sustainable financing calls for members’ mandatory contributions to rise gradually to account for half the agency’s $2bn core budget by 2028, from less than 20% now. “For far too long, health has been compartmentalised and deprioritised, nationally and internationally. It’s time to recognise that if we fail to invest in health, we fail to invest in the future,” Tedros said. Addressing long-term concerns over the performance of the organisation, Tedros said that members were within their rights to expect higher standards from the organisation, including “enhanced governance, efficiency, accountability and transparency”, syaing that included “zero tolerance for sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment”. The reference to sexual abuse appears to be a reference to a damning report last year that found that 21 employees working for the UN global health body were among perpetrators of serious sexual abuses during the Ebola crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The comments appeared directed at concerns – some of them politically motivated and levelled in particular by the former Trump administration, which withdrew from the WHO – around the WHO’s initial response to the coronavirus pandemic and research into its origins. Underling the continuing scale of the pandemic, Tedros said: “This Sunday marks two years since I declared a public health emergency of international concern – the highest level of alarm under international law – over the spread of Covid-19. “At the time, there were fewer than 100 cases and no deaths reported outside China. Two years later, almost 350 million cases have been reported, and more than 5.5 million deaths – and we know these numbers are an underestimate. Returning once again to the issue of vaccine equity, he added: “As it stands, 86 member states across all regions have not been able to reach last year’s target of vaccinating 40% of their populations – and 34 member states, most of them in Africa and the eastern Mediterranean region, have not been able to vaccinate even 10% of their populations. “Eighty five percent of the population of Africa is yet to receive a single dose of vaccine. How can this be acceptable to any of us? We simply cannot end the emergency phase of the pandemic unless we bridge this gap.”",News/World news,"‘Paradigm shift’ needed in way WHO is funded, says director general",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/24/world-health-organization-funding-who-director-general
1/25/2022,"Dominic Cummings has submitted written evidence to the inquiry into lockdown breaches in Downing Street in 2020, telling Sue Gray he did not trust Boris Johnson not to leak his conversations with the inquiry chief. The former senior adviser also claimed that officials were deeply uncomfortable with handing over some evidence to the inquiry, believing that they could face retribution for damaging evidence.  Cummings has claimed Johnson was warned in advance that a summer party invitation held in No 10 during the first lockdown was a breach of the rules. Both Cummings and another senior official are said to have warned Johnson the party was a mistake – but Johnson has claimed he believed the 20 May drinks in the garden to be a work event. Senior police officers are understood to have also have been interviewed by Gray, with evidence reported to be extremely damaging. Cummings said he was hesitant to speak directly to Sue Gray, the official leading the probe into multiple lockdown breaches. He said that other private discussions he had had since leaving government had been leaked. Cummings said that he had told Gray: “If we speak the PM will invent nonsense and spin it to the media and you and I will both have problems, let’s keep everything in writing, therefore he cannot invent things I’ve supposedly said to you, there is only a written record, this makes both our lives easier.” He added: “She agreed. So I have answered questions in writing and will answer further questions in writing if she wants. But I will not speak and therefore provide the PM with more chances to lie and confuse everybody.” Cummings said he believed officials would not hand over crucial evidence to the inquiry. “I know others are very worried about handing things to the Cabinet Office because they know the PM will see everything SG [Gray] collects,” he said. “This inevitably means that evidence, including photos, is not given to her and instead will keep leaking after her report. To stress, this is a consequence of beliefs about the PM’s integrity, not SG’s.” He said he believed more damaging stories would emerge this week, saying “many officials are desperate to shove the kunlangeta off the ice this week”. The latest detail from Cummings came amid transparency fears over the publication of the report, as two cabinet ministers said only the “findings” of Gray’s report will be published. Asked if it would be published in full, the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “So the terms of reference for Sue Gray’s report is that the findings of her report will be made public, and the prime minister has pledged he will come to parliament to then make a statement and be scrutinised by colleagues on the findings of that report.” Dominic Raab, the justice secretary and deputy prime minister, said on Sunday that it would be up to Boris Johnson to decide how much information was released.",News/Politics,"I don’t trust PM not to leak interview with Sue Gray, says Cummings ",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/24/dominic-cummings-submits-written-evidence-on-no-10-parties
1/25/2022,"As countless football managers have discovered over the years, the hardest thing of all to manage is the fans’ expectations. Amid the euphoria after Saturday’s Clarence House Chase at Ascot, though, a race that promised much and delivered even more, it was only natural that thoughts would soon turn towards Shishkin vs Energumene II: the Rematch. If both horses turn up and if both run to form, the Queen Mother Champion Chase at Cheltenham on 16 March seems certain to be the race of the Festival. But those are, of course, two very big “ifs” right there, and if racing history tells us anything, it is that you can only hope, and never expect. Saturday felt like the kind of race we are fortunate to see once in a decade, not twice in the space of eight weeks.  Such concerns are unlikely to affect the demand for tickets for the second afternoon of the Festival, however, and day two of the meeting just happens to be the one that is in need of a bit of a lift. Wednesday’s card slipped to the bottom of the attendance list in 2011 and shifted just 57,000 tickets in 2019, the only day of the four which did not pull in at least 60,000 racegoers. If the prospect of a rematch between Shishkin and Energumene does not see an uptick in sales, then nothing will, although it has to be said that Ascot’s crowd on Saturday was not noticeably swelled by their much-anticipated first encounter. The likelihood, perhaps, is that many occasional racegoers plan their trips to the track weeks in advance, to fit in with wider groups of friends or colleagues. They already had plans by the time a very welcome, but equally unexpected, head-to-head crystallised a few days before the race itself. Like it or not – and there are plenty of National Hunt devotees who do not – Cheltenham in March is the only stage that means anything to many with a more casual interest in the sport, and Nicky Henderson and Willie Mullins both made it plain too on Saturday that the Champion Chase is the race that really matters. If Energumene can reverse the form at the Festival, it will feel more like a 3-1 win for his connections than a 1-1 draw. Both trainers deserve huge credit for having their horses spot on for Saturday when Cheltenham is already on the horizon. It bears repeating that Shishkin and Energumene went into the Clarence House with official ratings of 172 and 171 respectively and both apparently ran to within an ounce or two of their best. The jeweller Boodles has been announced as the new sponsor of the Cheltenham Gold Cup, the feature event of the Festival meeting in March, following the decision by cider brand Magners to end its association with the race after the 2020 meeting. Steeplechasing’s championship race was run to support the charity WellChild in 2021, when anti-Covid regulations forced the meeting behind closed doors, and Boodles will donate a piece of jewellery for auction to support WellChild as part of its sponsorship agreement. Boodles is a former sponsor of the week-long contest for the leading rider at the Festival, and also of the meeting’s juvenile handicap hurdle since 2018. “It is wonderful to enjoy this association with Boodles, such an iconic British brand, at Cheltenham,” Ian Renton, the track’s managing director, said on Monday, “and we are very proud to see this partnership expand to take on the most prestigious jump race in the world.” They also, understandably, drove each other on to the finest performances of their careers. The official handicapper’s verdict on Shishkin’s performance is due tomorrow, but Timeform moved him up to a mark of 181 (still 1lb ahead of Energumene) which also puts him 1lb in front of the peak rating for Altior, his former stable companion and dual Champion Chase winner. The time of Saturday’s race was also as strong as the visual impression implied, with both horses comfortably posting the best Timeform timefigure of their careers. That, of course, also underlines that it was the hardest race either has experienced, and it would be no great surprise were either or both to be still feeling the effects just 51 days later. A big head-to-head somewhere other than the Festival made for a refreshing change but it could potentially have its downside too, though in that respect, Shishkin and Energumene could not be in better hands. Mullins and Henderson have 148 Festival winners between them and have no peers when it comes to training a horse to the minute in mid-March.
