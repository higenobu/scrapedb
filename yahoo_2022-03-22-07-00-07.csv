3/22/2022,"Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for a rescue operation and investigation into a China Eastern Airlines jet that crashed into a mountain during a domestic flight on Monday.

Flight MU5735, which carried nine crew members and 123 passengers, reportedly went down near Wuzhou in the Guangxi autonomous region just before 2:30 p.m., Beijing time.

VariFlight, a China-based civil aviation data provider, said the plane was up at about 8,900 meters (approximately 29,200 feet) when it started to slow down and descend at 2:19 p.m. Minutes later, it dropped to 1,300 meters (4,265 feet) and lost radar contact.

Flight-tracking website FlightRadar24.com reported a similar account. According to its data, the aircraft was up at about 30,000 feet (9,144 meters) when it entered a deep dive just after 2:20 p.m.
 


A truck driver identified only as Li recalled seeing smoke as he drove to Wuzhou.

“I was about 2-3 kilometers away, I couldn’t hear the sound but the black smoke was there, it looked like an explosion,” Li said.

At approximately 3 p.m., the Wuzhou Fire Brigade deployed 25 fire engines and 117 firefighters to the crash site. A batch of 538 fire and rescue personnel from all over Guanxi followed and helped extinguish the blaze at around 5:15 p.m.

Multiple medical personnel were also deployed to the site; however, not a single survivor has been reported to be found as of this writing.

In response to the crash, China Eastern Airlines reportedly suspended all 737-800 jets and assembled nine teams to deal with accident investigation, aircraft disposal and family assistance. China Eastern is one of the country’s leading airlines.

 Boeing delivered the aircraft, which reportedly had a good safety record, to the airline in June 2015. “[We] can confirm the plane has crashed,” China Eastern said in a statement. “The company expresses its deep condolences for the passengers and crew members who died in the plane crash.”Later on Monday, Xi called for the immediate activation of emergency mechanisms to address the accident. The State Council, which functions as China’s cabinet, will have its officials investigate the crash as a priority, as well as general safety hazards to improve passenger safety.Premier Li Keqiang called for maximum search and rescue efforts in service of the victims’ families.The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), the Ministry of Emergency Management and other relevant departments have also sent working groups to aid in the rescue efforts and aftermath of the crash.

3/22/2022,"Senior U.S. officials are coming to believe that Russia has moderated its war goals in Ukraine after stiff resistance inflicted heavy losses and shattered any hope of a swift and easy victory, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday. Per the Journal, international observers believed Russian President Vladimir Putin's initial objective was to capture Kyiv within days, depose Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and install a pro-Russian puppet regime. Now, Biden administration officials told the Journal, Putin's goals appear to be less ambitious. If Putin can bully Ukraine into accepting neutrality, recognizing Russian claims on Crimea and the Donbas, and surrendering a ""land bridge"" connecting the two, he'll be able to spin that as a win back home. Securing this land bridge would require capturing the port city of Mariupol. Russian forces encircled the city weeks ago and have been pushing into its neighborhoods in recent days. On Sunday, Russia demanded that the city surrender, but Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk replied early Monday that ""[t]here can be no question of surrender,"" Reuters reports. Putin may well be looking for an off-ramp from this war. An assessment released Saturday by the Institute for the Study of War in Washington, D.C., concluded that Ukraine has ""defeated the initial Russian campaign"" and that Russian forces must take a ""lengthy operational pause"" to regroup if they are to have any chance of capturing major Ukrainian cities. In an address to the nation on Sunday, Zelensky said Ukrainian forces have killed over 14,000 Russian troops since the invasion began less than four weeks ago. The U.S., which estimates Russian military deaths at around 7,000, lost just over 4,500 troops during the nine-year Iraq War. None of this is certain, however. The Institute for the Study of War released another assessment on Sunday reporting that Russia appears to be ""preparing its population"" for a protracted conflict by ""implementing increasingly draconian mobilization measures.""

3/22/2022,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge climbed up an ancient Mayan “sky palace” in the jungle on Monday, a man-made structure likened to the Buckingham Palace of its day. The couple clambered up the steep steps of the “Caana” at Caracol, a Mayan archaeological site in the jungle in the Chiquibul Forest. The Duchess was heard to say “wow” as she gazed out over the forest from the halfway point. Caracol was once the hub of life in the foothills of the Maya Mountains, close to the border with Guatemala and is believed to have been occupied as early as 1200 BC. At 43 metres (141ft) high - 540m above sea level - it is the tallest, man-made structure in Belize. Allan Moore, director of architecture in Belize, showed the Cambridges around the site, and said: “It’s like looking at the inside of Buckingham Palace.” He added: “It was a vast community of 150,000 people. Three thousand years ago, this would have seemed a modern place.” The Duchess was casually dressed in a white t-shirt tucked into khaki trousers with white Superga plimsolls and sunglasses. The Duke also wore sunglasses and a matching khaki shirt and trousers. The original settlement dates back to 400BC, developing into a more prosperous city by 200AD. Once home to 100,000 people, it measures 75 square miles and is five times larger than even the country’s biggest modern inhabitation, Belize City. Its name derives from the Spanish for snail shell because of the spiralling access road that led to the site. Mr Moore showed the Duke and Duchess some ancient Mayan carvings, prompting the couple to point out lizards, fish nibbling on water lilies and a feline shape, which he explained could have been a jaguar, a resident of the jungle area surrounding them. He also walked them round to an area where the ancient Maya used to play ball games. As they began the trek up to the top, the couple paused to peer into the ruins, asking their guide questions. They stopped at the halfway point to admire the view, posing for pictures before turning to continue the climb. But the Duke got the giggles when he found himself face to face with another group of photographers positioned behind them. ‘We got one [group] one side and another the other. You are in each other’s photographs,” he laughed. Mr Moore told them: “People often like to try and run up here.” The Duke was shocked. “What they race?” he asked. “You must be very fit if you are doing this three times a week, Allan.” Caracol was discovered by a Belizean logger in 1937 when the country was then British Honduras. Archaeologists spent several decades excavating it, discovering monuments, tombs and extensive terrace systems. The Caana is believed to have been built so that high priests and rulers could be closer to the sky. Asked how Belize felt about the British monarchy, Mr Moore said: ‘It’s as relevant here as it is in the UK. It’s Symbolic and we respect that. And some people like having a monarchy far, far away. “As an archaeologist, I cherish what is rare. As a good Belizean, I welcome the prince and his wife. We are known to be a hospitable nation. They will enjoy this.”",World/The Telegraph,Duke and Duchess of Cambridge take in the view as they climb up ancient Mayan palace,https://news.yahoo.com/duke-duchess-cambridge-view-climb-202347770.html
3/22/2022,"
 The International Chess Federation (FIDE) announced on Monday it was imposing a six-month competition ban on Russian chess grandmaster Sergey Karjakin for his public support of the invasion of Ukraine. The organization said Karjakin, 32, had been found guilty of violating the FIDE Code of Ethics, which states that disciplinary action will be carried out in instances that cast the federation in an ""unjustifiable unfavorable light and in this way damage its reputation."" ""The statements by Sergey Karjakin on the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine has led to a considerable number of reactions on social media and elsewhere, to a large extent negative towards the opinions expressed by Sergey Karjakin,"" FIDE said. It was determined that Karjakin's online statements posed a threat to the reputation of chess, himself and the FIDE, the federation said. Karjakin will be permitted to appeal the organization's decision. Shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine, Karjakin issued an opinion on social media to Russian President Vladimir Putin, expressing his support for the attack and spreading the baseless claim that Kyiv was pushing a genocidal Nazi regime. As The Guardian reported, Karjakin, born in Crimea, argued on social media that he was being targeted for his support of Putin. ""An expected, but no less shameful decision by FIDE,"" Karjakin wrote on Telegram. ""All sports selections have been trampled, the basic principle that sport is out of politics has been trampled,"" he continued. ""Most importantly, first of all I am a patriot of my country and only second of all I am an athlete. If I thought back to the situation when I supported the president of Russia, the people and the army I would have done the same thing! I don't regret anything."" Fellow Russian grandmaster Sergei Shipov was not banned, with the FIDE saying he was ""considerably less known and has, therefore, a less powerful platform."" They also noted that Shipov's statements were ""slightly different and less provocative character than the ones made by Karjakin."" Last week, the FIDE banned the Russian and Belarusian teams from competing in official FIDE tournaments on the recommendation of the International Olympic Committee.",World/The Hill,Russian chess grandmaster suspended for publicly supporting invasion,https://news.yahoo.com/russian-chess-grandmaster-suspended-publicly-201205601.html
3/22/2022,"Arnold Schwarzenegger’s video appeal to the Russian people has been remarkably effective. The famed film star and former California governor posted it not only on Twitter, but also on Telegram, which is used almost exclusively by Russians. For days, Russian state media tried to ignore it altogether—but millions of views across multiple platforms forced them to address Schwarzenegger’s powerful message. “That face is the cover page of American imperialism and colonialism,” TV host Vadim Gigin declared on state TV show Sunday Evening With Vladimir Solovievon, raging about Arnold Schwarzenegger and his video clip. “Not the caricature image of Uncle Sam, but this Schwarz, in a Hollywood production.” Wild Kremlin TV Hosts Threaten the U.S. With Nuclear Strikes Unless Sanctions End and Reparations Are Paid Gigin seemed particularly peeved with the first comments Arnold made in his video. In an effort to dodge state media’s propensity to immediately dismiss any criticism as “Russophobia,” Arnold had opened his address with reminders of his fondness for the Russian people, with years of positive interactions long before Vladimir Putin started a full-fledged war against Ukraine. “He, in California, will tell us, who live here… the truth?! That is their approach towards us,” Gigin fumed. Visibly furious, Gigin recounted the second half of Schwarzenegger’s video, where he mentioned the cup gifted to him by champion weightlifter Yury Vlasov, which Arnold continues to use to this very day. Gigin opined that Schwarzenegger never understood Vlasov, who opposed the dissolution of the Soviet Union. “Vlasov couldn’t transfer any of his brain [to Schwarzenegger] with his handshake and the gifted cup,” he sniped. Host Vladimir Soloviev then chimed in by pointing out: “Schwarzenegger twice traveled to Iraq to support the American troops and never tried to tell the Iraqi people why they’re being destroyed.” It’s not only state media pundits who are outraged with Arnold’s video. Russian powerlifter champion Maryana Naumova, who has expressed her admiration for the likes of notorious Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad, weighed in with her response to the message, which was published by the Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda on Monday. In her commentary, Naumova accused the American film star of “living in an alternative, imaginary reality.” Baselessly accusing the Ukrainian government of Nazism, she claimed: “The fact that Mr. Zelensky, as you say, is a Jew, did not help them. Nazism has no nationality, Nazism is not based on the word ‘German.’ And Russophobia is no better than anti-Semitism.” Referring to Schwarzenegger’s famed feature films, Naumova proclaimed: “Do you remember how in the second part of the Terminator your hero goes back in time to prevent the creation of Skynet, which would bring the death of all mankind? Russia's special military operation does not aim to destroy the Ukrainian people. It is aimed at the neo-Nazi Skynet, which over the years has completely subjugated Ukraine and was about to turn into an uncontrollable monster, dangerous for all of its neighbors, not only for us... Don’t side with Skynet, Terminator.” Zakhar Prilepin, a famous Russian writer who boasted of “killing many” in the last war in Donbas, and who is wanted by Ukraine’s SBU security service on charges of “taking part in the activity of a terrorist organization,” also had harsh words for Arnold. Prilepin wrote on his Telegram channel: “In his video message, Schwarzenegger, who killed three million Russians in his films, told the Russian people how much he loves us and how wrong we are about Ukraine... This Austrian, the son of his father, who served in the SS and was wounded near Leningrad, is trying to act as the good cop.” Russian Forces Destroy Massive Kyiv Mall, Killing at Least Eight Prilepin complained that the United States is “pumping Ukraine full of weapons to massacre the Russians,” failing to mention that Russia is the aggressor in this war. He added: “Arnie, you are a predator and an enemy.” As a guest on Soloviev’s Sunday show, Prilepin stressed that the Russians shouldn’t try to convince the West of their humanity and good will. He argued that Russia’s approach towards the West should be as harsh as possible: “If they’re seriously afraid of the conflict with Russia, of WWIII, of nuclear war or the escalation of the conflict, we should be convincing them that we’re ready for it, that we love it, that we like to make war.” Read more at The Daily Beast.
