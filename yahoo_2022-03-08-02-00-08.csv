3/8/2022,"A south Florida teacher was taken to the hospital last week after she was attacked by a 5-year-old student, leaving her ""dazed"" and ""unresponsive,"" authorities said. The unidentified instructor was found by first responders “sitting on the ground against the wall"" and ""appearing to be in a faint state"" at Pines Lakes Elementary School, about 15 miles southwest of downtown Fort Lauderdale, according to a heavily redacted Pembroke Pines Police Department incident report. The victim was ""clearly weak and dazed,"" able to ""blink and breathe regularly but at no point was able to vocally respond or show signs of a response,"" the report said. The troubling incident started when a 5-year-old had to be removed from class for “throwing things around” and “flipping the chairs,” police said. The youngster was taken to an empty “cool down” room, where the attack on the teacher allegedly took place, police said. The teacher was taken to Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood. Her young alleged attacker was charged with ""aggravated assault with hands, fist and feet,"" authorities said. A police spokeswoman on Monday told NBC News she did know know the instructor's condition and a representative for the teachers union could not be immediately reached for comment. Broward County Public Schools officials referred all questions about the beating to police. The district, though, did share a message that Principal Susan Sasse sent to parents and staff, acknowledging there had been ""an incident that occurred in school"" which required ""a staff member to be transported to a local medical facility"" on Wednesday last week. ""At all times during the incident, our campus was secured,"" Sasse reported. ""As always, the health, safety and well being of our students and staff continues to be my highest priority."" The school has nearly 800 students, who range in age from pre-kindergarten through the fifth grade.",U.S./NBC News,"Florida teacher beaten and hospitalized after attack by 5-year-old student, police say",https://news.yahoo.com/florida-teacher-beaten-hospitalized-attack-162747938.html
3/8/2022,"IRPIN, Ukraine — The bridge was just a shell of its old self, blown up days earlier by Ukrainian soldiers intent on slowing the Russian advance on the capital, Kyiv, but battered as it was, it offered a lifeline to civilians desperate to flee the fighting. On Sunday, as Ukrainian refugees were milling near the entrance to the structure, calculating their odds of making it safely over the Irpin River, a family laden with backpacks and a blue roller suitcase decided to chance it. The Russian mortar hit just as they made it across into Kyiv. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times A cloud of concrete dust lofted into the morning air. When it settled, Ukrainians could be seen running madly from the scene. But not the family. A mother and her two children lay still on the roadway, along with a family friend. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly denied that his forces are targeting civilians fleeing battle zones. He did so again on Sunday, a day after a railroad track used to evacuate Ukrainians came under fire. But only a handful of Ukrainian troops were near the bridge when mortar shells began raining down. The soldiers there were not engaged in combat but in helping refugees carry their children and luggage toward the capital. “The military is the military and that is one thing,” one soldier said bitterly. “But these are civilians, people who waited until the last moment.” The attack at the bridge was witnessed by a New York Times team, including photojournalist Lynsey Addario, a security adviser and Andriy Dubchak, a freelance journalist who filmed the scene. Since Saturday, hundreds of Ukrainians fleeing the fighting in three towns on Kyiv’s western rim have clustered around the bridge to make their way to the capital — which is also in Moscow’s cross hairs. Civilians who cross the bridge into Kyiv form small groups and together run about 100 yards while potentially exposed to Russian fire. Ukrainian soldiers run alongside the civilians to help them and then return to take cover behind a cinder block wall. But early Sunday morning, the regional governor announced that the routes out of Irpin were so unsafe as to be effectively blocked. “Unfortunately, unless there is a cease-fire,” he said, no one could get out. But people kept trying, scrambling over the debris of the damaged bridge and dashing across the exposed street. When the mortar shells hit, Ukrainian forces were engaged in clashes nearby, but not where the civilians were moving along the street on the Kyiv side of the bridge. Outgoing mortar rounds could be heard from a Ukrainian position about 200 yards away, far enough from the bridge to suggest that the Russians were either purposefully targeting the evacuation route or disregarding the risk of civilian casualties. The mortar shells fell first 100 or so yards from the bridge, then shifted in a series of thunderous blasts into a section of street where people were fleeing. As the mortars got closer to the stream of civilians, people ran, pulling children, and trying to find a safe spot. But there was nothing behind which to hide. When the family — a mother, her teenage son and a daughter who appeared to be about 8 — was spotted sprawled on the ground, soldiers rushed to help, but could do little for them or a man described as a family friend who had been helping them escape. The group’s luggage was scattered about them. A small green pet carrier lay nearby, too. A dog could be heard barking. © 2022 The New York Times Company",World/The New York Times,Ukrainian Family's Dash for Safety Ends in Death,https://news.yahoo.com/ukrainian-familys-dash-safety-ends-123002433.html

3/8/2022,"Stolichnaya vodka is severing its final tie to Russia and changing its name to ""Stoli."" Stoli Group said it rebranded as a ""direct response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine."" Yuri Shefler, the Russian-born billionaire founder, said he'd been exiled from Russia since 2000. Stolichnaya vodka is rebranding to go by its nickname ""Stoli."" The vodka brand, which has previously been marketed as Russian, changed its name as a ""direct response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine,"" Stoli Group said in its press release on Friday. The founder of the company, the Russian-born billionaire Yuri Shefler, said the name, and its association with Russia, was no longer representative of the brand. ""While I have been exiled from Russia since 2000 due to my opposition to Putin, I have remained proud of the Stolichnaya brand,"" Shefler said in the press release. ""Today, we have made the decision to rebrand entirely as the name no longer represents our organization. More than anything, I wish for 'Stoli' to represent peace in Europe and solidarity with Ukraine."" Shefler said he was forced to move to Luxembourg because Russian President Vladimir Putin attempted to ""wrest control"" of the brand. Ownership of the brand has been disputed between Shefler's Stoli Group, which is based in Latvia, and Sojuzplodoimport, a firm owned by the Russian state, since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. ""I have personally experienced persecution by Putin's regime and I share the pain of Ukraine and its people,"" Shefler said. The company's production facilities are in Latvia. Last week, Stoli Group said it would only use Slovakian sources to avoid any ties with Russia. Stoli Group's announcement comes as businesses and state officials across the country call for a boycott of vodka. Though many vodka products are advertised as Russian, only about 1% of vodka in the US comes from Russia.
