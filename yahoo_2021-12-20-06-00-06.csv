12/20/2021,"An Indiana couple helped police arrest a man wanted for a deadly hit-and-run after they realized he was their house guest. Police arrested John Killough Jr., 52, and charged him with leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death. Killough is accused of striking and killing 11-year-old Kyson Beatty and fleeing the scene. An Indiana couple frantically called the police after they realized their house guest was wanted for the deadly hit-and-run of an 11-year-old boy. Kyson Beatty, a sixth-grader at Perry Middle School, was struck by a vehicle on December 11 on Wicker Street south of Indianapolis. Beatty, who had been riding a small motorcycle, was pronounced dead on the scene, according to a release from the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department. Police later identified a flatbed truck as a vehicle of interest and were searching for the driver. A week later, Katie Book and Craig King said a man identified as John Killough Jr. showed up at their home on December 17 asking for a place to stay. They recognized Killough as the friend of a neighbor. ""They started talking, and (Killough) wanted to stay in the camper, and (King) said, 'Well, you could stay for the night,'"" Book told CBS 4. ""We let him in this morning to warm up, and we fed him and let him take a shower,"" Book added. ""He was definitely nervous."" That's when Book opened Facebook and saw Killough's picture, along with the information that he was wanted by police in connection with the previous week's deadly hit-and-run. ""I freaked out and jumped up,"" Book said, adding that she called the police. ""I'm like, 'That's the guy, that's the guy.'"" Police arrested Killough, 52, at Book and King's home on the 3500 block of Orange Street, about 15 miles northeast of where the hit-and-run occurred on Wicker Street. Jail records show Killough was charged with leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death, operating a vehicle as a habitual traffic violator, and possession of methamphetamine. A vigil was held for 11-year-old Beatty last week by the Decatur Youth Football League. Meanwhile, a GoFundMe for Beatty's family has raised over $19,000. Book said Beatty's father came to their home to thank them in person. ""He said, 'At least now before I lay my son to rest on Monday, I've got closure knowing he's behind bars,'"" Book told CBS 4.

12/20/2021,"By Min Zhang and Ryan Woo BEIJING (Reuters) - Debt problems at a major Chinese property developer have now spilled over into a vital artery of the nation's industrial engine - the steel sector - and started to ripple through to other critical parts of the world's second-largest economy. The spreading balance-sheet crisis at real estate firms is a warning for policymakers as a swing in the fortunes of the steel industry would have significant repercussions for China's economy, with cement, glass, and household appliances all vulnerable to demand drops. Already, steel prices are down from their record highs seen earlier this year due to easing demand from construction activities, which account for over half of the metal's consumption, while steelmakers' share prices have also been hurt. Steel's acute sensitivity to the ebbs and flows in construction and manufacturing makes it a closely-tracked bellwether for China's economy, which has started to slow down from the second quarter. Steel firms are also massive employers that support a vast supply chain. Hitting steel operations, real estate developers have dialled back investment in projects to conserve cash in a sector squeezed by tighter borrowing regulations that have engulfed indebted companies, most notably China Evergrande Group. ""We normally stockpile steel products in winter at relatively lower prices and sell them after the new year holidays when consumption resumes. But we are holding off this year,"" said Qi Xiaoliang, a Beijing-based steel trader. ""There's still uncertainty in the real estate market for 2022 and the situation is not expected to be fully reversed for another six to 12 months,"" he added. In the final quarter of 2021, the property market took a further hit as the unease in the sector shook already weak buyer sentiment, with unsold housing stock in China's 100 biggest cities reaching a five-year high in November. Demand for homes is expected to ease further in 2022, hitting downstream manufacturers of household products. Cement production, another construction material, was down around 16% for September-November year-on-year, and was lower versus the same period between 2017 and 2019. Demand for earth excavators has also dropped off in recent months. The broadening spillover impact of the property downturn was also seen elsewhere. In the appliances industry, for example, monthly refrigerator output has been falling since May through to November on an annual basis. REVERSAL IN FORTUNES Steel producers were among the best performers of the entire Chinese economy over the first three quarters of 2021, with China's 28 major listed mills pocketing over 106 billion yuan ($16.61 billion) in net profits, up 174% year-on-year and 129% higher than in pre-pandemic 2019. But the boom times in the steel sector are over. The paralysis that has struck China's mammoth construction industry is triggering a rare contraction in building activity across the country. New construction starts by floor area have contracted from a year earlier since July - their longest stretch of declines since 2015. The slowdown in the real estate sector has dented China's monthly crude steel output by more than 20% since September. The closely-tracked steel equity instruments and commodities futures have captured the reversal of fortunes. After gaining roughly 90% through mid-September, the CSI steel equities index has plunged 27% since, while futures prices for construction materials rebar and wire rod have tumbled 24% and 31% respectively from their historical highs to erase almost all their gains this year. As steel producers hit the brakes, the key inputs used in steelmaking have also taken a shellacking, with Dalian Commodity Exchange iron ore futures down more than 45% from their record in May. Gross profits for steel rebar have started to trend down from the peak seen in late September. UNCERTAIN OUTLOOK Property-related sectors are the single biggest contributor to China's economy, accounting for 28% of GDP in 2021, down from a recent peak of 35% in 2016. The GDP share is broken down into a 7% direct contribution from property and a 21% indirect contribution from construction and through sectors along the supply chain such as machinery and equipment, according to Moody's. A government industry consultancy forecast China's steel demand will slip 0.7% in 2022, following an expected 4.7% decline this year.[nL1N2T102U] Looking ahead, any extended credit constraints ""could reduce demand for metals used in construction as developers lose the ability to pay for raw materials at high prices,"" analysts with Fitch Solutions wrote in a recent note to clients. If the contraction in construction spending endures, it will then affect the producers of appliances and white goods that constitute a key part of China's critical manufacturing base. ""Property construction has been the engine of China's economy for over two decades now,"" said Frederic Neumann, Co-Head of Asian Economics Research at HSBC. ""With building activity likely to remain depressed for quite some time, growth will inevitably shift down a gear or two.""

12/20/2021,"Maryland's Republican Gov. Larry Hogan predicted that Donald Trump would not run for president in 2024. Hogan told Fox News that it would be 'bad' for the country and the Republican party if Trump ran. Trump has teased a 2024 run but has not committed to the idea. Republican Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland predicted Sunday that former president Donald Trump would not run for president in 2024. Speaking with Fox News' Bret Baier on Sunday, Hogan said it would be ""bad"" for the country if Trump were the 2024 nominee. ""I think that'd be bad for the party and bad for President Trump and bad for the country,"" Hogan said. ""So I don't think he's gonna run, and I would â€” my advice would be that he did not run."" Baier also asked Hogan if he would consider running for president in 2024. Hogan is in his second and final term as Maryland's governor, which will end in January 2022. ""I'm gonna be governor until January 23, and then I'm going to take a look at what the options are after that,"" Hogan said. It remains to be seen whether Trump will run for president in 2024. While he exited his presidency with the lowest approval ratings in his term, he has steadily maintained control over the Republican party, with some Republicans insisting they cannot be successful without Trump. Hogan has been a frequent critic of the former president and those in his party who have refused to cut ties with him. ""I think they're concerned about retaliation from the president,"" Hogan said in a May interview on ""Meet the Press"" of Republicans who refuse to criticize Trump. ""They're concerned about being attacked within the party. And it just bothers me that you have to swear fealty to the 'Dear Leader' or you get kicked out of the party. It just doesn't make any sense."" In a November tweet, Hogan mocked Trump's 2020 performance in Maryland after the former president endorsed the rival to Hogan's preferred candidate to replace him as Maryland governor. ""Personally, I'd prefer endorsements from people who didn't lose Maryland by 33 points,"" Hogan wrote on Twitter, Insider previously reported.
