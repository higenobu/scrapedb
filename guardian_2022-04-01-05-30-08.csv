4/1/2022,"A12.30pm kick-off after an international break will concern Jürgen Klopp more than any back-slapping to celebrate his 250th league game in charge of Liverpool on Saturday. Even a manager as despairing of the schedule as Klopp, however, may privately concede that Watford’s early arrival offers an ideal opportunity in his quest to unnerve and ultimately unseat Manchester City. Liverpool would go top with a 10th successive Premier League win and 10th consecutive home league win when Roy Hodgson’s relegation-threatened side visit. They would be on the summit for only a few hours should City respond in kind at Burnley but the sense of Liverpool closing in would have been reinforced before Pep Guardiola and his players emerge at Turf Moor. It feels inexorable on current form. City have been top since beating Watford on 4 December and held an 11-point advantage over their only genuine title rivals at the start of January, having played a game more. Their lead was nine points at the start of February, six when March opened and has been whittled down to one before the business end commences in April. Liverpool, who have equalled their points tally for last season, have reasserted their claims to be far more than a “pain in the ass” to Guardiola. They are his greatest obstacle in the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League too, and the strongest squad of Klopp’s near seven-year Liverpool reign appears well-equipped to handle the physical load. There is no questioning their ability to handle the demands mentally. “We are not close to thinking about any crazy stuff like that,” the Liverpool manager said when, with the Carabao Cup in the bank, the subject of winning the quadruple cropped up with a quarter more substance. He will continue to straight-bat the possibility, certain in the knowledge that one tired performance, bad decision or injury crisis could shatter the historic quest and one draw can have profound repercussions in a Premier League race with a City team capable of producing another flawless run of their own. But there is justification for others to contemplate crazy stuff, and for Liverpool supporters to dream about it before the showdown at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday week. From the rare luxury of a month-long pre-season training camp in Austria and France last summer until the 47th game of their season before the international break, Liverpool’s objective, as Klopp has stated, was to build a foundation to deliver in April and May. In that respect his team have timed their run to perfection. Liverpool have dropped two Premier League points since the turn of the year; City seven points in their past seven league games. There have been 16 wins in 19 matches in all competitions in 2022, including the remarkable penalty shootout success against Chelsea in the Carabao Cup final, and their only defeat, against Internazionale in the Champions League, could not derail progress to the quarter-finals on aggregate. Benfica await next week. The Portuguese club are third in Primeira Liga. Liverpool defeated the leaders, Porto, 5-1 and 2-0 in this season’s group stage. No team in England’s top four divisions have conceded fewer league goals at home than Liverpool (seven), and the improvement in squad depth was evident throughout the Carabao Cup campaign and when Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané departed for the Africa Cup of Nations after scoring in the 2-2 draw at Chelsea in January. That month’s signing of Luis Díaz, who has assimilated seamlessly since his arrival from Porto, has embellished an already formidable forward line. Klopp’s aversion to talk of a quadruple is understandable, however. Liverpool produced several laboured performances before the international break but, as in the slender victory over West Ham or defeat by Inter at Anfield, managed to find a way through. The loss of Trent Alexander-Arnold to a hamstring injury is significant, with the team’s most creative force responsible for 11 Premier League assists this season and 17 in all competitions. The right-back spent time rehabilitating in Dubai during the international break and, while not expected to feature against Watford or Benfica on Tuesday, remains on course to return for the crucial trip to the Etihad. Andy Robertson should be available on Saturday despite having to self-isolate with Covid on Scotland duty. Salah returned to Liverpool by private jet on Wednesday after Egypt’s latest penalty heartbreak at the hands of Senegal and Mané the night before. The Egypt international has been castigated in some quarters back home for his country’s failure to reach the World Cup, with Salah sending his penalty over in the shootout, and Klopp will be wary of any emotional toll on his leading goalscorer. The pain could work in Liverpool’s favour as Salah channels his frustrations into their three remaining targets for the season, or decides the sanctuary of Anfield is worth a contract extension. A home date with Watford looks an inviting way to start for a striker with nine goals in seven outings against them. Klopp’s personal milestone is even more impressive. No Liverpool manager has overseen as many league wins in their first 250 matches as the 54-year-old, who has 159 victories in 249 games. Kenny Dalglish was the previous highest with 150 from his first 250. The potential exists for 16 more this season, along with unprecedented achievement.",Sport/Football,Liverpool and the quadruple may not prove such a laughable notion | Andy Hunter,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/31/liverpool-and-the-quadruple-may-not-be-such-a-laughable-notion
4/1/2022,"Proposals to restructure the board of Yorkshire and enable the county to host international cricket again this summer have been overwhelmingly approved by members on a pivotal day in the history of one of cricket’s most famous clubs. Yorkshire lost its right to host international matches in the wake of its handling of racism allegations brought against the county by the former player Azeem Rafiq. Kamlesh Patel was subsequently appointed as chair last November to help oversee structural, wholesale changes at the county but a proposed extraordinary general meeting to approve the changes had been cancelled on two separate occasions, while former chair Robin Smith had indicated he would vote against the reforms. With the England and Wales Cricket Board promising it would lift the ban on hosting international matches providing a number of conditions were met by the end of March, Yorkshire faced the prospect of a day that could have had grave ramifications on the county’s long-term financial future if the proposals were turned down by members. But in Headingley’s famous Long Room on Thursday evening, over 80% of the 1,100 members both in attendance and via proxy voted in favour of the changes. Lord Patel’s appointment as chair – something Smith had described as “invalid” – was given the seal of approval before members voted in favour of the removal of Graves Trust powers and the appointment of six non-executive directors to the club’s board. Patel said: “We welcome the outcome of this EGM and thank the Members for their full and proper consideration, an open exchange of views, and their votes. It means Yorkshire can stage internationals against New Zealand and South Africa this summer, in the process averting a major financial crisis. It is an overwhelming vote for positive change. “This support will help Yorkshire County Cricket Club to be an inclusive and welcoming place and gives us the clarity and certainty we need to keep building this great club. Yorkshire has now met the ECB’s conditions for the return of international cricket and, working with them, we’ll deliver some great events here at Headingley this summer.”",Sport/Sport,Yorkshire free to host international cricket again after members’ vote,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/31/yorkshire-free-to-host-international-cricket-again-after-members-vote

4/1/2022,"The third episode of WeCrashed, Apple TV+’s eight-part series on the precipitous rise and fall of the WeWork founders Adam and Rebekah Neumann, gives the viewer a small taste of being a startup employee. It’s 2012, and a nameless female employee arrives for her first day; she’s given a key card, an Apple laptop, a reminder that there’s a 7pm “Thank God It’s Monday” meeting, and a mimosa. In one of the most effective montages of the series – largely because it draws attention away from the two eccentric, delusional founders who take up the vast majority of screen time – we whirl through the nameless female employee’s hedonistic, exhausting life at WeWork. Coffee, shot, staff party, sex with a co-worker in a supply closet. Adam Neumann leading employees in a “we!” “work!” call and response. Another shot, another day, pass out, wake up, repeat. Is it night or is it noon? At a desk or at a party? Doesn’t matter – she’s at work, which is life. This ethos of so-called “hustle culture” – the idea that work is life and the self derives value through constant work – courses throughout a number of recent shows set across the 2010s. It’s most overt in WeCrashed, based on the Wondery podcast of the same name, in which Neumann literally urges workers to “hustle harder” (also the title of its fifth episode, which airs this Friday). The Theranos employees in The Dropout, Hulu’s eight-part series on Elizabeth Holmes’s fraudulent blood-testing company that was once the darling of Silicon Valley, work through the night, missing kids’ birthday parties and dinners in the name of changing the world. Same for the Uber staff in Super Pumped, Showtime’s series on Uber’s relentless, now disgraced founder Travis Kalanick, who berates employees to pursue growth at any cost (and change the world.) Anna Delvey, the scammer at the heart of Netflix’s Inventing Anna, is most chagrined that her notoriety as the “Soho grifter” overshadowed how hard she worked at the business plan that ultimately exposed her; the journalist who covers her is so obsessed with the story and its import for her career that she goes into labor in the office. These shows, which all depict headlining stories of singularly deceitful, messianic people, have been loosely classified as true-con TV, “bad entrepreneur TV” or modern grift series in the headline-to-TV pipeline. These are all fair descriptors – all four series, which premiered in the span of a month, evince our evergreen fascination with the art of the scam (see also: recent Netflix docu-series hits The Tinder Swindler and Bad Vegan). But they are also, in piecemeal fashion, building the iconography of a certain slice of millennial experience now barely discernible in rear-view. There are the deliberately dated nods to the late 2000s/early 2010s – the music (Katy Perry gets a name drop in both WeCrashed and The Dropout), the fashion, the fascination with (and mourning of) Steve Jobs. And there is an awkward, inchoate through-line of “hustle culture” or “workism” – the distinctly American, quasi-religious belief system among the college-educated elite (myself included) that work is not merely a job but an identity, an arbiter of self-worth, and a cause worth believing in. WeWork was not a company, Adam Neumann infamously said, but a movement. Hustle culture, like other ideologies, is amorphous. It undergirded the #girlboss, the rise of the influencer, the complete elision between self and livelihood online; there’s no clear start or end, though look around and you can see evidence of its demise. There’s recent blowback over Kim Kardashian’s advice to businesswomen to “get your fucking ass up and work”, eulogies for the heady, doomed early days of venture capital-backed digital media, the so-called Great Resignation and The Age of Anti-Ambition. These shows appeal to current prestige TV sensibilities – antiheroes, timeline jumping, expensive hair-and-makeup transformations by famous actors – but they feel distinctly of another era, a time of “rise and grind” sloganeering. They may ultimately each focus on a singularly fascinating, loathsome individual and uncomfortably posit that the people who believed them weren’t rubes, but to describe them as portraits of modern grift is an incomplete picture. Together, they compose a limited, loose and imperfect mosaic of a belief system that transcended those roped in by Holmes, Kalanick, the Neumanns or Delvey. They’re also part of a larger evolution of workism on television. Showtime’s Billions and HBO’s Industry, both shows about the financial industry which became modest hits in the late 2010s, hinge on the hook of watching (hot) people run their personal lives and morals through the (lucrative) grinder of a hyper-competitive, all-consuming job. HBO’s Succession, one of the most critically acclaimed shows on TV, is about a group of people with absolutely no distinctions between work, personal life and family. In a buzzy New Yorker profile about Succession star Jeremy Strong, the British actor Brian Cox, who plays patriarch Logan Roy, said of Strong’s notoriously intense acting method: “It’s a particularly American disease, I think, this inability to separate yourself off while you’re doing the job.” That’s a good summary of Apple TV+’s current sleeper hit Severance, in which characters undergo a brain procedure that literally separates their work and life selves. Severance is, as the Ringer’s Alison Herman argues, the eerie latest entry in the genre of “uncanny office” shows like Corporate, Better Off Ted or Loki. Call it the mystery-box inverse to the hustle culture show – instead of blurring the lines over an 18-hour day, Severance is an extreme allegory of work-life balance that also points to something sinister in the corporate office. Which is not to say that all the hustle culture shows work as effective critiques, or as entertainment worth sinking 8-10 hours into. Inventing Anna, as I’ve written previously, is both too credulous of Anna and yet not interested enough in her. In a strange and unrewarding decision, the modern workplace soap master Shonda Rhimes turned the scammer story into a newsroom drama in which a fictionalized journalist, Vivian Kent (loosely based on Jessica Pressler, the New York Magazine writer who reported the definitive Anna Delvey feature in 2018) obsesses over saving her career through Anna’s story. Super Pumped, created by the Billions co-creators Brian Koppelman and David Levien, matches Uber founder Travis Kalanick’s (Joseph Gordon-Levitt)’s carnivorous business leadership – growth at all costs – with gonzo flourishes (narration from Quentin Tarantino, breaking the fourth wall) that ultimately underscore his self-importance. The Dropout is by far the best of these shows, the only one to nail the tricky balance between the thrill of the scammer and the devastation of their lies. WeCrashed, created by Drew Crevello and Lee Eisenberg (a writer, producer and director on The Office), has a better grasp on the absurdity of the office setting than one might expect and a compellingly toxic duo in Anne Hathaway’s Rebekah and Jared Leto’s Adam, but comparatively frivolous stakes. Adam seems to convince and succeed by the inexorable rising tide of plot; valuation numbers are batted around with too many zeros to feel consequential. The Hollywood Reporter’s Angie Han called the series “amusing but ultimately inessential”, and I cannot think of a more accurate description. Part of the appeal and the issue with the hustle culture shows is that they depict a history that is too recent to see clearly and yet too distant, especially since the pandemic cleaved the timeline for many viewers, to feel of the zeitgeist. Still, there is something unsettling about watching WeCrashed, a series which depicts an idea in extremity – the neon “hustle harder” signs and “do what you love” mugs are hustle culture at its most explicit – that is barely out of date. (Full disclosure: in 2019, I worked as a member of the Guardian US at a New York WeWork office.) The Thank God It’s Monday parties and billion-dollar valuations are supposed to seem ridiculous in this 2022 show, and they always were. The haphazard results of these hustle culture shows reflect a culture just beginning to understand that.",Arts/Television & radio,Hustle harder: how TV became obsessed with stories of workism,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/31/wecrashed-hustle-harder-tv-workism
4/1/2022,"Good morning. Senior European Union officials are worried about a deepening alliance forming between Russia and China. Families in Victoria earning up to $132,000 will be able to rent homes from the state government. And flood-hit regions in New South Wales have been left reeling from the latest devastation as rains finally ease. European Union leaders are being urged to tell China it will face sanctions if it offers military aid to Russia for the war in Ukraine, amid concerns about a deepening authoritarian alliance that threatens the rules-based international order. Senior EU and Chinese leaders are expected to hold discussions on Friday at a video summit that is likely to be dominated by the war. EU diplomats said the the bloc’s representatives needed to pass on a message that Beijing would pay a price for any intervention in support of Russia’s war. Current sanctions on Russian oligarchs and officials, however, do not appear to be stopping them from flying into and out of EU and UK airports despite flight bans and sanctions imposed, a Guardian data investigation has found. Meanwhile, Ukraine has launched a fresh attempt to rescue civilians from Mariupol after warnings from the Red Cross that thousands of lives depend on the successful evacuation of people trapped in the besieged city by Russian forces. A total of 45 buses were en route to the nearby southern coastal town of Berdyansk, Ukrainian deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said, as well as a team delivering humanitarian aid and assisting evacuations from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The convoy was expected to enter the city on Friday morning after Russian promises of a limited ceasefire along the route from Mariupol to the Ukraine-held city of Zaporizhzhia. Families earning up to $132,000 will be able to rent homes from the Victorian government as part of a scheme it says will help ease housing affordability concerns in the state. On Friday, the housing minister, Richard Wynne, will announce the affordable housing rental scheme, which will make about 2,400 homes from the government’s $5.3bn “big housing build” available to rent. In metropolitan Melbourne, rents will be set at least 10% below the median market rent of the area – and capped at 30% of the median income in Melbourne. In regional Victoria, creating extra supply is the priority for the scheme. Rents will be set at the median market rental price for that area, as well as limited at 30% of the median income in regional Victoria.

Israeli forces have raided a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, setting off a gun battle in which two Palestinians were killed and more than a dozen were wounded, the Palestinian health ministry said. The British government has provided more than £5bn in the past three years to overseas energy and infrastructure projects linked to labour abuses and environmental damage, according to documents and interviews with workers. Beijing has expelled its high profile former justice minister and deputy police chief from the ruling Communist party, denouncing him as being “extremely despicable” and accusing him of befriending “political frauds”. Paris climate agreement goals will fail unless the rights of Indigenous people who protect rainforests are honoured, according to a new report.

4/1/2022,"When I agreed to try presenting an episode of Newsround, I wasn’t expecting this. “I’ll talk about how animal poo is being used to heat up homes to generate power,” says presenter Martin Dougan, who is about to pretend to be a guest. “You can ask whatever questions you want, but remember: my name is Jerry and it is about poo.” Next week, Newsround celebrates its 50th anniversary. Hence my visit to the set of the children’s news bulletin: partly because the show’s production team have invited me to mark the milestone by presenting a whole (fake) episode – and thus understand how hard it is to cover news for children. But also because Newsround was a mainstay of my childhood. Without it, I don’t think I would be a journalist. When I turn up at the Salford studios, I’m met by the show’s editor, Lewis James. He has recently gone through the show’s archive, to see how they reported on major news stories, such as Nelson Mandela’s release from prison. He also uncovered some items he did not expect. “There’s a 30-minute documentary from John Craven on the Bay City Rollers,” he says. Newsround axed the evening edition of its bulletin after 48 years in 2020, citing changes to how children watch television. A shorter eight-minute bulletin still airs in the mornings. According to James, this strategy has proved popular with teachers. “A survey by the BBC shows that 75% of primary school teachers say they use Newsround at least once weekly in the classroom.” While Newsround has expanded its offering to a website and social media page, reflecting where younger audiences are these days, its mission statement has not changed since the Craven years. “Where there is reassurance, we give kids that,” says Lewis. “Where we can give kids hope, we will do that. We won’t sugarcoat it. We won’t say everything’s all right in the world. But we will give information in a different way from other news outlets.” I’m given a brief of how the recording will work and how best to interact with the news items and the production gallery. This is a flood of information, most of which goes immediately out of my head. Afterwards, I look down at my notepad and realise that I have only written one word: poo. From the pandemic to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, current affairs coverage is often overwhelming to adults, let alone children, but this doesn’t stop Newsround from reporting on it. “Kids already know about these things, whether they’re hearing it from the grownups in their life or in the school playground,” says Hayley Hassall, one of the show’s presenters. “We are here to tell them what is really happening and give them the facts, so that they feel empowered with the knowledge to be able to do something.” Nonetheless, Newsround does take a gentler approach to the news than more other outlets, as shown by its recent report on the help Ukrainian refugees had received after arriving in Poland. It looks at the donations and supplies provided by local people, before focusing on a refugee who had been enrolled in a local school and had already made friends. Distressing images, such as ones shown that day on the BBC News at Ten, do not appear. Neither is there any analysis or speculation on what could happen next. “Speculation isn’t helpful for kids,” said the show’s deputy editor Kirsti Adair. “They want reassurance.” Will they get it from me? As I prepare for my rehearsal, I’m not so sure. I’m miked up and sent to the studio. I’m asked to stand on an X on the floor for the camera positioning, and my nerves cause me to sway like a cruise ship. Every time I’m off camera, such as when I’m moving to the sofa during a news report, my voice goes up an octave. Then, an unexpected challenge. When I introduce “Jerry” it becomes obvious that he isn’t there to talk about poo. Rather, he is a disruptive guest, constantly going off-topic, a reminder that live children’s television can be unpredictable at the best of times. “How can you use poo to create energy?” I innocently ask. “I don’t know anything about that!” Jerry responds, with two minutes left on the item. For Newsround’s crew, this isn’t the biggest problem they have to deal with. The war in Ukraine – and some of the content circulated on TikTok – is a source for concern for the production team. It is not just misinformation, but the impact of viral videos – a recent one highlighting the destruction that could be caused if a nuclear bomb landed on Manchester, London or Bristol. The topic can also be a challenge to cover because they don’t want to reiterate what these videos say. “The reason that you may be seeing this on your feeds, or your friends are talking about it in the playground, is because it’s dramatic,” says Lewis, “but not necessarily because it is true.” Another difficulty can be how to unpack essential yet incredibly complicated new stories. When asked what it was like to report on the complexities of Brexit, a groan from several of the production team reverberated around the room. Explanations are needed in news stories where you wouldn’t expect them. In the report about Ukrainian refugees, Poland is introduced as a country that “borders Ukraine”. “You have to assume that they [children] have no idea every time,” says Adair. “Even if you are doing Ukraine for the third day in a row, you assume that some kids are tuning in for the first time.” The need to report so concisely and clearly makes it no surprise, then, that the show has had such notable alumni, from Channel 4 News’ Krishnan Guru-Murthy, to Newscast’s Adam Fleming, via the BBC’s entertainment correspondent Lizo Mzimba. Senior BBC News journalists, such as security correspondent Frank Gardner and Kyiv correspondent James Waterhouse, are often drafted in to explain complicated news stories. How do they find the transition? “Some are better than others,” says Hassall. One challenge is to ensure that they don’t talk down to children. “Or throw in a horrific detail,” adds Adair. Heavier stories are often immediately followed by lighter stories, too, with animal news being a favourite. “I did a live broadcast next to a goose once and it pecked my head,” says Hassall. She then reels off anecdotes as if such events happen to all of us. “I’ve swum with sharks. I’ve jumped out of a plane at 21,000 feet. I’ve rescued a lion from France.” “You rescued a lion from France?” I ask. “Two lions, actually,” she says. By the time of the recording, I’m not quite feeling brave enough to tackle lions, but I am a little bit more confident. I remember that the Autocue is there to follow me, not the other way round, so I try to resist reading it faster and faster. Unfortunately, it doesn’t exactly go to plan, given that Jerry has put on a fancy dress giraffe’s costume, and is insisting that he’s here as a spokesperson for the long-necked creatures, to “give them the platform that I think they deserve.” When I hear the slight panic of the gallery informing me that this mess of an interview with Jerry is overrunning, I swiftly bring it to a close, only for Jerry to shout: “Thank you, Mum!” to the camera. I follow it up with: “Thank you to Jerry’s Mum!” It’s all a bit of a blur. Only later, when we are looking back at the footage, and I see myself on screen in front of a set, does it feel as if I was in a proper news studio. It reminds me that the world of television can appear distant and overwhelming to some children, so I ask Hassall and Dougan whether younger viewers lose it if they spot them in public. “I mean, we’re not Little Mix!” responds Hassall. I don’t say anything, but I can’t help think: when I was a child, they would have been a much bigger deal than that.",Arts/Television & radio,‘I realise I have only written down one word – poo’: what happened when I was a Newsround presenter for a day,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/31/newsround-bbc-50-anniversary-presenter
