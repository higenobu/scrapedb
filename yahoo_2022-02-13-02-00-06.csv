2/13/2022,"Sophie Draper says she was removed from an American Airlines flight due to her nut allergy. The airline refused to accommodate her allergy, Draper said in a series of Twitter posts. Draper has a severe allergy that puts her at risk for life-threatening anaphylaxis if she inhales an allergen. A 26-year-old woman from England said she was booted from an American Airlines flight because the airline would not accommodate her nut allergy. In a series of tweets, Sophie Draper — who has a severe nut allergy that puts her at risk for life-threatening anaphylaxis — said she first mentioned her health condition at the gate when boarding a flight from London to New York in December 2021. According to Draper, the head of cabin crew informed her they were ""contractually obliged to serve hot mixed nuts in first and business class."" Draper had purchased a seat in economy. However, due to the severity of her allergy, she explained that sitting in economy would not protect her from the risk of inhaling an airborne allergen. —Sophie Draper (@EnergySoph) February 6, 2022 Draper's boyfriend, who was planning to fly to New York with her, asked staff what the protocol would be if she went into anaphylactic shock on the plane. ""He knows how to use your EpiPen, right?"" a crew member said in response, according to Draper's tweet. That's when Draper and her boyfriend were removed from the flight, Draper said. ""I broke down in tears,"" Draper tweeted. ""I felt totally discriminated against for a health condition I have no control over."" Draper's boyfriend filed a complaint against the airline over a month ago, she tweeted, but has not yet seen any action. ""American Airlines made me feel like my health and safety and that of others with severe food allergies is not important,"" she told HuffPost UK. ""I have no control over my nut allergy and the danger it presents to my life if I were to go into anaphylaxis."" ""The least airlines could do is take this health condition seriously by making appropriate announcements and replacing nuts with another snack,"" she added. In a statement to Insider, American Airlines said it prioritizes ""the health and safety of those who fly with us."" ""We regret that we disappointed Ms. Draper and her travel partner during this trip, and our team has reached out to apologise and hear more about their experience,"" a spokesperson for the airline said. The airline also urged people allergies to take medical precautions ahead of their flight. Draper and her boyfriend were offered a refund for bag fees.

2/13/2022,"New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman is getting dumped on for supposedly sitting on a big story that former President Donald Trump clogged White House toilets by trying to flush ripped-up pieces of paper. It was a pretty big-ass scoop, one that many people felt that Haberman should have reported sooner rather than saving for her upcoming book, “Confidence Man,” according to the Independent. Haberman isn’t the first person accused of withholding vital information about the Trump administration in order to presumably juice book sales. Bob Woodward and John Bolton also faced similar accusations. But Haberman decided she wasn’t going to take that kind of crap and defended herself on CNN Friday. Haberman insisted she did not know about Trump’s supposed document dump when he was in office, and said she’s “not known for, you know, sitting on scoops if I have information.” She said she found out about Trump’s toilet antics after he was out of the White House and pointed out that the information isn’t exactly being held for her book. “That book is not out for eight months, and so I am trying to get this information out as fast as possible because I think it’s relevant,” she said. “Do I know that it is particularly meaningful in terms of what pieces of paper ended up where? We do not. I don’t want to suggest that, you know, I know more than I do, right?” Haberman said she thought the toilet story was relevant and “would not want someone thinking that I knew this in real time because I didn’t.” You can see her exchange with John King below. .@maggieNYT insists that she did not save her report that then-President Trump clogged White House toilets by flushing documents for her book.
