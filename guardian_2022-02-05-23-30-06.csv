2/5/2022,"It’s when leather-jacketed Serra Petale fans out a hand of flaming playing cards and lights her cigarette off them that you know it’s going to be love. This scene from the video for Las Panteras, part of a linked series of pulpy tales in which the London-based quartet Los Bitchos portray Charlie’s Angels-style secret agents on the trail of a criminal cat gang, encapsulates their charm: silly, self-aware, swaggering with punked-up global psychedelic grooves. Formed in 2017 over a mutual love of cumbia (Afro-Latin dancing music, laced with rock guitar), Los Bitchos are Australian Petale, ex-drummer of dreamy indie rockers Kid Wave on guitar; Uruguayan former model Agustina Ruiz on keytar; Swede Josefine Jonsson, once of garage rockers Thee MVPs, on bass; and Londoner and NHS physiotherapist Nic Crawshaw on drums.  As the million-plus views on their KEXP live session attest, they’re a band who need to be experienced live, though they’ve bottled their lightning with debut album Let the Festivities Begin!, on which cumbia parties with Turkish and Middle Eastern psych-rock and distorted, fuzzy surf-garage. Recorded pre-pandemic, it was produced by Alex Kapranos of Franz Ferdinand (also the creepy quiz host in the video for Good to Go!), who provided vintage synths and razor-sharp discipline. It’s music made by crate-diggers who aren’t chin-scratchers, whose laudable main ambition, as they told NME, is to “play all over the world and make people dance”.  Let the Festivities Begin! is out now on City Slang.

2/5/2022," Actions have consequences. Unless, of course, you’re rich and powerful, in which case it seems you can just go ahead and do whatever you like. Lie, cheat, stick your hand down your trousers when you find yourself in a hotel room with a woman young enough to be your granddaughter. Knock yourself out! The chances you’ll face any meaningful repercussions are low. The chances you’ll be asked on a reality TV show and have your reputation laundered, on the other hand, are high. Exhibit no 476, Rudy Giuliani: the guy who was once considered “America’s mayor” and a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination but then proceeded to set his reputation on fire and stomp on the ashes. Donald Trump’s former personal lawyer. The guy who helped Trump with all his unhinged and very undemocratic attempts to overturn the 2020 election. That guy. Well that guy has managed to thrust his way into the headlines once again – in one of the most inane ways possible – after he was unmasked as a contestant during a taping of the Fox show The Masked Singer. Unfamiliar with The Masked Singer? It’s a ridiculously popular competition in which celebrities sign and dance in costumes that hide their identities; at the end of each episode the losing celebrity’s identity is revealed and everyone is stunned. This season’s panel of celebrity judges were certainly stunned when Giuliani revealed himself: two of the judges, Ken Jeong and Robin Thicke, walked off the stage in protest. (Thicke, by the way, is not exactly a social justice warrior. He’s a singer whose most famous song, Blurred Lines, has been described as “kinda rapey”. The model Emily Ratajkowski, who appeared in the video for Blurred Lines, has also accused Thicke of sexually assaulting her while the video was being filmed. As a number of people have observed, you know you’ve messed up when you’ve offended Thicke’s moral sensibilities.) Thicke and Jeong aren’t the only ones outraged over Giuliani’s musical number. It has attracted the ire of a few late-night TV hosts. “The guy who’s trying to destroy our country? He’s singing on a show!” Jimmy Kimmel scoffed on his own show. “No headline has captured the national zeitgeist of existential dread combined with ridicu-stupo-lousiness better than this,” said Stephen Colbert of Giuliani’s Masked Singer appearance. Getting an overwhelming sense of deja vu? I certainly am. From Sarah Palin to Sean Spicer to Anne Widdecombe, a wide variety of odious figures have gone on the reality TV show circuit to reinvent themselves. If they don’t get a gig on reality TV, they get a gig on Fox News, which is essentially the same thing. There’s a little bit of outrage but it quickly dies down. The reputation laundering works. Just look at George W Bush, for example. He may not have gone on reality TV but he hung out with Ellen DeGeneres and painted a few terrible portraits. Now an embarrassing number of liberals have forgotten all about that nasty Iraq business and think of Bush fondly. He’s morphed from man-accused-of-war-crimes into cuddly grandpa in a scarily short period of time. I’m all for giving people second chances. I’m all for giving people the chance to rehabilitate themselves. But that doesn’t mean forgetting and forgiving just like that; accountability is important. When you reward liars and cheats with TV appearances then you send a message that lying and cheating is fine (hilarious even!) as long as the right sort of person is doing it. You give the worst sort of people carte blanche. You help pave the way for monsters. This isn’t a complicated issue: the lines are by no means blurred. Giuliani, under Trump’s orders, tried to get the Department of Homeland Security to seize voting machines in an attempt to overthrow the 2020 election. We all know what happened to him next. Now compare his case with Pamela Moses, an activist in Memphis. Last November Moses was convicted for trying to register to vote while she was ineligible. On Monday she was sentenced to six years and one day in prison. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, Tennessee officials have conceded that they had made a series of mistakes concerning Moses’ voting eligibility. Everyone’s equal under the eyes of the law, eh? “[H]ospitals disproportionately [drug] test and report pregnant and postpartum patients of color,” a representative from National Advocates for Pregnant Women told ReWire News Group. One study found that despite similar rates of substance use among Black patients and white patients, Black women were reported to social services at about 10 times the rate of white women. The Guardian reviews Nan Sloane’s new book, which profiles the working-class female radicals overlooked by history. One reason why these women have been “hidden from history”, Sloane suggests, is that a lot of feminist history is focused on voting rights. These women were more concerned about feeding their families than the right to vote: they marched for bread and smashed machinery in protest at unregulated capitalism. “The vote, for them, is a luxury that [would] have to wait.” In certain instances anyway. During a recent press briefing Associated Press reporter Matt Lee asked the Biden administration to explain its rejection of Amnesty International’s new report on Israel, which explicitly said its US-backed policies amount to apartheid. “Why is it that all criticism of Israel from these [human rights] groups is almost always rejected by the United States and yet accepted, welcomed and endorsed when the criticism is of other countries?” Lee asked. It’s an essential question: if you undermine human rights groups when it comes to their work on Israel-Palestine, you undermine all of their work. I barely go on social media any more because the amount of online harassment I get. My experience, of course, isn’t unusual. If you’re a woman, particularly a woman of colour, with any sort of platform you are expected to deal with grotesque levels of harassment – it’s part of the job description! Aubrey Hirsch covers the exhaustion of existing as a woman online beautifully in this essay, That’s How It Works When You’re a Woman on the Internet. A British weekly magazine asked women that question in 1889 and got some very witty answers. Years of domesticity has done a number on cats’ brains, according to a new study. A bunch of researchers measured cats’ heads (which one imagines was no easy feat) and concluded that the brain size of domestic cats is smaller than their African ancestors. Size isn’t everything, of course. They may have tiny little heads but you should never underestimate a cat.

2/5/2022,"In primates, what looks like a smile usually signifies submission. In humans, it’s more complicated. “There is a smile of love and there is a smile of deceit,” intones a disembodied voice – actor Cillian Murphy’s – at the start of the third live performance in a series by the Smile, the latest band headed up by Thom Yorke of Radiohead. The power trio is completed by fellow ’Head Jonny Greenwood, latter-day composer of film soundtracks, and drummer Tom Skinner of jazz activists Sons of Kemet. (Producer Nigel Godrich is a silent partner.) It’s a sunny January morning outside, contrasting with the dimly lit, alternative Sunday service indoors, in which a churchy Fender Rhodes features. The band have snuck a few hours’ kip after their earlier 11pm and 1am live streams. The only sign that they are not fresh as daisies is one slight mistake on one song.  The opening invocation is by William Blake, that great observer of humanity’s double nature. But there’s confusion too: last May, Yorke declared the Smile to be named after a particularly intense Ted Hughes poem. That confusion lingers. The songs that make up the Smile’s 15-song set list come under this new alias, but Yorke and Greenwood’s preoccupations and aesthetics are ongoing. In May, when the Smile debuted online at Glastonbury, they were hailed as a raw, almost post-punk outfit, in sharp contrast with Radiohead’s more rococo output. This morning, the clear blue water between the bands is less clear and less blue. As last spring, they play an unreleased song, previously thought to be by Radiohead – Skirting on the Surface. Yorke’s wracked croon takes centre stage and Greenwood’s effect-laden instrumentation now provides a trebly counterpoint. There is also Open the Floodgates, previously a solo Yorke tune, now warmed by the glow of Greenwood’s guitar notes and analogue blooping from the multi-talented Skinner, who frequently leaves the kit during this gig to man an electronic workstation. It climaxes as something akin to 60s systems music, one of the key features of the set. As these songs spool out, it seems the Smile’s rawness has proved ephemeral. The vast bulk of these songs are intense, layered and feature Yorke’s vocals and Greenwood on guitar. Exactly how is this not a Radiohead gig? Because Colin Greenwood, Ed O’Brien and Phil Selway are not here? So many of Yorke’s non-Radiohead projects have privileged digitals over instrumentation. It has been easy to interpret his extracurricular activity as the restless singer exploring electronic sounds that other members of Radiohead did not wish to. But the Smile is chock-a-block with guitars – electric and acoustic – with live drumming, and harp for good measure. Greenwood, who usually plays no part in Yorke’s side hustles, is in full swing in the Smile, fringe flopping, bowing his bass on Free in the Knowledge, hitting effects pedals with stockinged feet and playing keyboards with one hand as he attacks the harp with another on Speech Bubbles. (The downside is that the track sounds like three different songs being played simultaneously.) Free in the Knowledge starts off very Radiohead. But the keening and spacious percussion that closes the track is a beautiful departure. As the gig unfolds, there’s a sense that the Smile have been tuning in to much older electronic music, with resonant analogue synths providing clear division between the bands – like the insistent oscillations of The Same. Obviously there’s the magnificent Skinner too, whose default time signature is trigonometric. While not strictly playing jazz, he scrapes bells along his hi-hats, lifting the trio with his dynamism. The hectic clatter of Thin Thing is a revelation, with all three instrumentalists going hell for leather. Just Eyes and Mouth is practically Afrobeat, Greenwood’s guitar and Skinner’s kit doing genuinely new things. Most of those present (or tuning in online) will probably be thrilled at this not wildly novel iteration of the Yorke/Greenwood partnership. But the Smile are most musically convincing when they stretch farther away from Radiohead. Two Smile songs are, by now, familiar. The Smoke finds Yorke playing dubby, hip-swivelling bass – traceable, perhaps, to the influence of Red Hot Chili Pepper Flea and his sinuous work in that other great Radiohead spin-off, Atoms for Peace. The set ends with the excellently angry You Will Never Work in Television Again, whose lyrics about “bunga bunga” have confused those not familiar with the more unpleasant ins and outs of Italian public life in the Silvio Berlusconi era. (Yorke’s other half is a Sicilian actor.) The deceit of politicians is a welcome through line in Yorke’s work. It’s hard not to think of the Smile without thinking of Berlusconi’s shark-like dentistry, or the Tony Blair grimace.",Arts/Music,The Smile review – Yorke and Greenwood stay close to the mothership,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/05/the-smile-live-stream-thom-yorke-jonny-greenwood-tom-skinner-magazine-london
2/5/2022,"I had asthma as a kid and still do. I started blacking out a little at the end of training runs. Then, at 14, I was diagnosed with exercise-induced asthma by a brilliant doctor who told me, “This isn’t going to stop you doing any of your sport, you’re just going to have to learn to control it.” I have inhalers in pretty much every bag. What makes me sad? Losing people I care about – I lost my dad in 2020. And hearing stories about kids who weren’t as lucky as my daughter, who beat cancer last year. I burst into tears when the doctor gave us the initial diagnosis, but she’s been so brave. The chemotherapy made her hair fall out, which was obviously difficult for a teenage girl. But she’s bounced back so quickly.  I could probably beat my kids in a race, but it depends on the distance. If it’s more than 100m, yes – any less, probably not any more. They’re getting faster all the time. I got funny looks when I was chasing them around the supermarket when they were younger. The most famous person I’ve met is probably the Queen. I was awarded an MBE and was invited to lunch with about eight others at the palace. She was friendly, welcoming, genuine – an inspirational lady. I once saw Muhammad Ali sitting on the other side of an airport lounge. My husband was starstruck and staring, so Ali started jokingly punching the palm of his hand, then called him over and asked if he wanted anything signed. I remember coming out of hospital in New York after giving birth to my son and being in a shop, looking for a handbag. A lady looked over and started saying what a cute baby he was. When I looked up I realised it was Sarah Jessica Parker. She said, “I know you, you run the New York City marathon, we live on the route, my husband’s a big marathon fan.” I couldn’t believe it. I thought she was winding me up. The last mile of a marathon is easier than the couple of miles before it because you can almost see the finish. The biggest dangers at that point? Lurching spectators – and dogs, of course. When you’re running on very tired legs towards the end of a long run, it’s hard to react to a loose dog and move yourself out of the way quickly. The etiquette with needing the toilet during a run is probably try not to, but be prepared. If you can find a Portaloo in time, then that really helps. Obviously, it’s something that happened to me, but it’s not the highlight of my career. Being the best in the world at something is a surreal feeling. But it’s very much a team effort, it’s not all down to me. You haven’t seen me on roller-skates! I think I’m definitely better at running marathons.

2/5/2022,"Pakistani exiles seeking refuge in the UK are being advised by counter-terrorism police to keep a low profile following warnings that their lives may be at risk after criticising Pakistan’s powerful military. Counter Terrorism Policing, a collaboration of UK police forces and the security services, has told possible targets that they need to inform police if they intend to travel within the UK.  One British-based dissident said she had received information that hitmen linked to Pakistani drug gangs would be contracted to target her. The heightened alert follows a recent trial in which a London-based hitman was found guilty of conspiring to murder a Pakistani dissident. The trial heard how Muhammad Gohir Khan was offered £100,000 to kill a dissident blogger and fierce critic of the Pakistani intelligence services, Ahmad Waqass Goraya, in the Netherlands last year. However, the mysterious middleman behind the plot – known as “Muzzamil” – remains at large, with the Metropolitan police yesterday confirming they are still attempting to establish his identity and whereabouts. The Met would not comment on whether it is liaising with the Pakistani authorities to locate him. Officers have also issued a plea to the public for information on Muzzamil, who speaks with a British accent and, during a voice message heard at the trial, told Khan that future “jobs” in the UK and Europe would follow after killing Goraya. Days before the trial started last month, officers from Counter Terrorism Policing, whose brief is to “prevent, disrupt and investigate dangerous extremists”, visited the UK home of Pakistani political commentator Rashid Murad to review his security. Police have already installed a panic alarm and CCTV at his home and shared guidance on personal security from the national counter-terrorism security office. Murad said: “Two police officers visited my home in 2021, informed me that they had intercepted a communication in which it was revealed that some people were planning to harm me. They didn’t tell me who but indicated they were from the Pakistani authorities.” His brother, based in Manchester, has also been approached by the British authorities and informed of a potential threat. Another apparent target of the Pakistani authorities, lawyer Fazal Khan, said he had been informed by officers from the Met’s counter-terrorism command, SO15, to notify other UK police forces if he intended to travel outside the capital. The officers, he added, had discussed the mysterious death of Pakistani dissidents such as Karima Baloch, who campaigned for an independent Balochistan and was found dead in a lake in Canada in 2020. Khan, who has filed court petitions involving Pakistan’s military, said: “In the UK, a severe threat exists. London, Birmingham and cities like Sheffield with big Asian communities and where they [the Pakistani authorities] have people on their payroll. I was asked not to move around, not to leave the city and provide the police details of my contacts.” Khan has already survived a previous assassination attempt, in Pakistan in July 2020. Ayesha Siddiqa, an outspoken Pakistani political scientist and commentator based in London, has also been warned of threats to her life, and revealed that a well-connected lawyer had told her that the method used to target her would involve British-based Pakistani drug gangs. “That sense of being secure is gone,” she said. Siddiqa urged the UK government to pressure Pakistan to also identify a figure named in Khan’s trial who was referred to as the “boss” behind the murder plot, which ultimately failed because Khan could not locate Goraya. Goraya, a critic of the Pakistani military and government who the Met believes may have been targeted because of his “political views”, told the Observer that the attempt to kill him was “a transnational crime” in which Khan was merely the tool. “The EU and the UK should take up this matter with their Pakistani counterparts to end this. We didn’t move to Europe to live under the terror of the Pakistani military,” he said. The Observer spoke to a further five Pakistani dissidents, living in exile in five different cities in Europe, who all expressed similar concerns for their safety. Two had received police warnings of a potential threat to their lives. Zar Ali Khan Afridi, a Pashtun rights campaigner, who fled to the Netherlands after an abduction attempt, revealed he had received a life-threatening call from a British number. “The best thing about moving to Europe was that I thought I would be safe. Now there is always the fear of being attacked, killed or harmed,” he said. In France, journalist Yunas Khan said he had received an email in December from the French authorities, informing him of leaked audio files in which a figure from Pakistan’s ruling party, Tehreek-e-Insaf, tells the Pakistani community in Europe to attack Khan. “It is a matter of Pakistan’s honour,” says the man on the recording: “Go and make him accountable if you are legitimate sons of your parents.” The government of Pakistan said: “The levelling of malicious allegations such as Pakistani authorities targeting its critics through hitmen in foreign countries is nothing but absolute lies and sheer absurdity.” It added: “Those who are baselessly defaming and spreading propaganda against Pakistan military and intelligence agencies are doing it to accomplish either their own ulterior motives or that of their sponsors.” It added that when the Khan trial began “propagandists further amplified the smear campaign against Pakistan military and intelligence agencies without due regard for the law of the land by passing absurd judgments and initiating reckless propaganda over social and mainstream media on a matter that was subjudice”. It said the court had found Khan guilty “in his personal capacity”.",News/World news,"Your lives are in danger, police warn Pakistani dissidents in UK",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/05/your-lives-are-in-danger-police-warn-pakistani-dissidents-in-uk
