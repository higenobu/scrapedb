2/9/2022,"Freestyle skier Eileen Gu, poster girl of the Beijing Winter Olympics, delivered under immense pressure to hand China gold in the Big Air competition - and was then immediately labelled a 'traitor' by her critics. Nicknamed the ‘Snow Princess' by Chinese media, Gu, born in America but now competing under the flag of China, stomped down a massive final jump to finish with a combined score of 188.25, pushing France’s Tess Ledeux into silver on 187.50 with Switzerland’s Mathilde Gremaud taking bronze. The conclusion brought to an end a pulsating first Olympic skiing Big Air final - attracting the presence of International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach and Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai and in which Britain’s 17-year-old skier Kirsty Muir also finished a creditable fifth. But the result did not go down well with Americans, themselves still reeling from their team's worst start to a Winter Olympics in history. “#EileenGu is a traitor to the US. China must have paid her a fortune to represent them. She should stay in China for college & beyond,” wrote one Twitter user, while another posted: “Eileen Gu is a human rights abuse supporter and a traitor and should be dealt with accordingly. One can only hope she gets what’s coming to her.” Gu, born in San Francisco to an American father and a Chinese mother, has come in for heavy criticism since switching to compete for China in June 2019, the 18-year-old saying her goal was to be a role model for young Chinese girls who have not had many female athletes to admire. It was a message she reiterated after her gold-medal winning performance, in which she landed the first 1620 of her career on her final jump. ""No matter if I land that trick, I win because the whole world can see my spirit,"" she said. ""I want to break boundaries for girls, they can think as long as Eileen can do it, they can also do it."" That reason, however, has not been swallowed by many Americans - whose country is staging a diplomatic boycott of these Games over China’s poor human rights record - with Fox News even labelling her the “ungrateful child of America,” a sentiment found frequently under her social media posts. Gu has never publicly shared whether she renounced her US citizenship to compete for China and she again dodged repeated questions on it during her post race press conference - but she had a clear message for those critics. ""Here's the thing,"" she said. ""I'm not trying to keep everyone happy, I'm an 18-year-old here living my best life. ""It doesn’t matter if other people are happy or not. I'm enjoying the entire process and I am using my voice to create enough positive change for the voices who will listen to me in an area that is personal and relevant to myself. ""I know I have a good heart. And I know my reasons for making the decisions I do, they are based on a greater common interest and that something I feel like is for the greater good. ""And so if other people don't believe that is where I am coming from, that just reflects they do not have the empathy to empathise with a good heart - perhaps because they don’t share the same kind of morals that I do. ""I'm not going to waste my time trying to placate people who are one uneducated and two, they are not going to experience the gratitude and love I have the great fortunate to experience on a daily basis. If they don't believe me, and if people don’t like me, that is their loss: they are never going to win the Olympics."" She added: ""I've always expressed my gratitude to the US team as well, they have been nothing but supportive to me. Same to the Chinese team. Sport is a way we can unite people. It doesn't have to be related to nationality. It does not need to be used to divide people."" Gu - who speaks fluent Mandarin and has nearly two million followers on the Chinese social media platform Weibo - has been widely promoted by the Olympic hosts as the main star of the Games. Hopes are high that her Big Air title will be the first of a golden hat-trick with the slopestyle and halfpipe still to come. “That was the best moment of my life,"" she said immediately afterwards. ""The happiest moment, day, whatever — of my life. I just cannot believe what just happened."" Her face is splashed everywhere, from billboards to magazine covers as well as promotional videos of her running on the Great Wall of China. Multiple Chinese sponsors already have her signed up; she has made appearances for Vogue, Victoria's Secret, Louis Vuitton and Tiffany and documentary teams follow her every move. Despite the pressure, she put on a blockbuster performance at the purpose-built Big Air Shougang venue on Tuesday, cranking out the 1620 on her final jump to deny Ledeux gold. The French skier, the only other woman to ever land the trick in competition and who did so again in the opening round, albeit with a slight wobble on landing, could not better her rival's combined score on her own final effort, leaving the Chinese spectators to erupt in celebration. ""I don't want to beat anyone,"" added Gu. ""What I said to her (Ledeux) was I was really proud of her. The performance she did actually drove me to achieve my 1620, which I have never done before. I really want to share my medal with her and tell her, even though she is upset, I want to tell her that a part of this gold belongs to her."" Meanwhile Britain's youngest athlete in Beijing, teenager Muir was proud of her efforts in such a high-quality final. The Aberdeen skier, who also competes in the women's slopestyle on Sunday, landed her first two runs, including a huge 90.25 on her first attempt. ""It was an amazing competition and the level was just insane. It feels amazing to be competing against these girls. It's a dream come true just to come to the Olympics,"" she said. ""I've got a bit of studying to catch up for sure, I'm focused on my next event and then it's back to school."" By Oliver Brown in Beijing For China, it was an exquisitely choreographed Olympic moment: a brilliant 18-year-old freestyle skier winning a gold medal to sit alongside her multiple modelling contracts, all while Thomas Bach and a few hundred pre-selected fans clapped ecstatically in the background. The one complication is that Eileen Gu is not just the poster-girl of these Winter Games, but a pawn in a complex diplomatic game. No sooner did she toast the greatest moment of her young life than the word “traitor” began trending alongside her name. It does not take long listening to Gu to realise that she was born and raised a long way from Beijing. While fluent in Mandarin, she delivers her interviews in English in impeccable Californian upspeak. For it was just four years ago that, as a high school student in San Francisco, she chose to switch national affiliations and compete for China at the Winter Olympics. Her objective, she explained, was to wield greater influence as a role model than she could hope to manage in the United States. That rationale is hardly unfounded: long before she seized gold thanks to an astounding final jump in the Olympics’ inaugural Big Air competition, she was China’s chosen face of its sporting future, placed front and centre in every advert as its “snow princess”. But where her shift in allegiance stirred raptures here in Beijing, it has made her persona non grata among sections of her American audience. “Welcome to China,” said Fox News host Will Cain, on learning of her latest triumph. “I hope stardom and the riches that you have earned through betraying America are all worth it, because you have definitely sold out.” The problem for Gu, who is shortly to enrol at Stanford University, is that she would like to have it both ways. Her oft-repeated mantra is that “in the US, I’m American, and when I’m in China, I’m Chinese”. It is a cute line, but sadly impractical, for the simple reason that China does not recognise dual citizenship. The clear implication is that, by declaring for China, she has renounced her US passport, a subject on which she repeatedly refuses to elaborate. As such, when she represents her decision solely in terms of idealism, others see only opportunism. Kristi Leskinen, who was the pre-eminent advocate for freestyle skiing to be included at the Olympics, casts doubt on Gu’s motives. She highlights how while the US system has made Gu the athlete she is today, it is China that has transformed her into a commercial phenomenon, with endorsements from Louis Vuitton and Victoria’s Secret, plus invitations to the Met Gala and Paris Fashion Week. Under normal circumstances, you could only congratulate her on monetising her prodigious talent. Except the conditions under which Beijing 2022 is being staged are anything but normal. Relations between the US and China are at their frostiest in decades, with President Biden ordering a diplomatic boycott of the Games after his intelligence agencies described Chinese treatment of the Uyghur population in Xinjiang province as a genocide. For Gu to imagine that in this climate, she can be a supranational butterfly, balancing vastly different cultural expectations and attitudes to free speech, is at best naive, at worst downright cynical. The scenes at the Big Air final captured the problem perfectly. For there next to a grinning Bach was Peng Shuai, the tennis player who vanished from the radar for almost three weeks last November after accusing the country’s former vice-premier of sexual assault. Her presence alongside the president of the International Olympic Committee was designed to assure us that she was safe from Chinese oppression. The bleaker reality is that she has been shamelessly paraded in Beijing as a prop, compelled to conduct an interview in which she denied ever accusing Zhang Gaoli of attacking her. You might reasonably imagine this is a subject on which the highly-educated Gu should hold strong views. Certainly, it bothers her Big Air rival Jamie Anderson, who has lamented: “We can’t speak about anything important, which is really b-------.” Except Gu’s alliance with China prevents her from offering the mildest criticism. When, in an otherwise passionate and eloquent press conference performance, she was asked whether she was worried we were not hearing the full story about Peng, she retreated to platitudes. “I’m grateful that she is happy and healthy and doing her thing again,” Gu said. Except Peng is not just “doing her thing”. For 48 hours, she has been used as a human crutch for Bach and the Chinese autocracy he is enabling. on Tuesday night, she left the closed loop to confront 21 days’ quarantine and an uncertain fate. Perhaps this is not Gu’s problem, but the fact that she is incapable of expressing any concern is troubling. It demonstrates the impossible circle she is seeking to square: being the darling of US fashion magazines one minute, and a symbol of Chinese patriotism the next. Gu, for her part, shrugs off any suggestions of pressure, insisting she is an “18-year-old trying to live my best life”. But what she regards as having the best of both worlds soon risks becoming a dangerous compromise. By Oliver Brown in Beijing The Canadian women’s ice hockey team took the astonishing decision to wear surgical-grade face masks for all 60 minutes of an Olympic round-robin match out of fears that their Russian opponents could be infected with Covid-19. With the contest in Beijing already delayed by over an hour amid Canada’s suspicions over Russian Covid test results, the players took to the ice with N95 masks underneath their face shields for the entire game. Despite World Health Organisation advice that masks should not be worn during exercise, the team insisted that they were acting out of an abundance of caution. “We wanted to make sure that everyone who was participating was healthy and that we were lowering the risk,” said Rebeeca Johnston, a Canadian forward. The roots of their mistrust lay in a remark by Russia’s Alexandra Vafina that she and her team-mates had been subject to additional testing measures as “close contacts”. Under protocols enforced by the Chinese for the Beijing Winter Olympics, a close contact is defined as anybody who records a CT value of 35 to 40, usually as a result of a historic infection, or who is within two metres of a positive case for more than 15 minutes. With some members of the Russian team in isolation last week after their arrival in China, Johnston suggested Canada, who won 6-1, had not been prepared to take any chances. “I think we weren’t sure what was going on,” she said. The International Ice Hockey Federation officially attributed the in-game mask-wearing to “safety and security concerns”. Canada’s move reflected the paranoia that has taken root among athletes at these Games, where just two consecutive positive results - with thresholds for positivity far more exacting than those used in standard PCR testing - can trigger confinement at a Chinese quarantine facility. It also came in spite of Russia’s insistence that they had complied with all necessary precautions. “We are trying to follow all the strict rules and to prevent the spread of disease,” Vafina said. WHO recommendations state that masks should be avoided for vigorous physical activity as they can create difficulty breathing and promote the growth of microorganisms. Issues around masks have become a central issue in this week’s unprecedented protests in Ottawa. A state of emergency has been declared in the Canadian capital due to a truckers’ revolt against the country’s stringent mask and vaccination mandates.",World/The Telegraph,Chinese skiing gold medallist hits back at critics after being labelled a 'traitor',https://news.yahoo.com/chinese-skiing-gold-medallist-hits-091002630.html
