1/20/2022,"The Trump Organization failed to produce email records from a top executive for more than a year, according to the New York AG's office. The delay meant that Chief Compliance Counsel Jill Martin had to be interviewed twice. The company blamed it on ""email migrations,"" according to the AG's office. The Trump Organization said that for more than a year, email snafus prevented it from handing documents over to New York Attorney General Tish James from its executive in charge of conflict-of-interest rules, according to court documents. For years, James's office has been conducting an investigation into whether the Trump Organization manipulated property values so that it paid little in taxes while receiving favorable loan and insurance rates. The delay meant that Chief Compliance Counsel Jill Martin had to sit for a second interview with the AG's office, according to a letter sent to the Trump Organization in April 2021 and made public in court filings Wednesday. ""We have reviewed the 18 documents you produced on Friday evening, and they do not come close to completing the Trump Organization's production obligations with respect to Ms. Martin,"" Assistant Attorney General Colleen Faherty wrote in the April 19, 2021 letter to a company attorney. ""As we have expressed to you, we believe it is a waste of resources to proceed with her testimony at this time because the Trump Organization has failed to make a complete or even reasonable production of her documents."" The Trump Organization had said that ""email migrations"" from 2019 prevented attachments from Martin's emails related to the valuation of a golf club in Los Angeles from being located, according to a second letter filed to court. The letters were included as exhibits in a set of court filings where James asked a judge to force Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr., and Ivanka Trump to sit for depositions and answer questions about the Trump Organization's finances. James' office had already taken depositions of Eric Trump and Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg, who both ran the company during Donald Trump's presidency, when it issued subpoenas in December to the other Trump family members. Earlier in January, the Trump family members asked a judge to quash the subpoenas, and Donald Trump filed a federal lawsuit seeking to halt James' investigation. Representatives for the Trump Organization have denied wrongdoing and said the investigation is politically motivated. The new filings from James' office argue that documents and testimony the office obtained show there is ample evidence the Trump Organization lied about its property values. For example, James' office said Trump's personal triplex in Manhattan's Trump Tower was valued at $127 million and $327 million in different financial filings that described the apartment as being 30,000 square feet. The apartment is actually 10,996 square feet in size, according to documents obtained by James' office. The exhibits detail how slow the Trump Organization was to respond to document requests over time. The company was first subpoenaed in December 2019; by the time Martin sat for her first interview with the attorney general's office, on April 20, 2021, James' office said the company still hadn't done a thorough search of its own internal files. Seven days after that interview, James's office informed the Trump Organization that its investigation had become criminal in nature, though the move was not made public until nearly a month later. The investigation has been running in tandem with a similar probe from the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, which brought criminal charges against the Trump Organization and Weisselberg in July 2021. In a follow-up letter, dated July 27, 2021, Faherty wrote that the company still hadn't adequately explained why ""migration issues"" from nearly two years earlier were preventing it from producing ""hundreds of relevant and responsive emails"" from Martin. It's unclear if the Trump Organization handed over more of Martin's emails in advance of a second interview. But in another follow-up letter, dated November 1, 2021, Faherty didn't include Martin in a list of employees whose records the office still wanted. Martin didn't immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

1/20/2022,"The Biden administration will distribute 400 million high-quality N95 masks through ""tens of thousands"" of pharmacies, community clinics, and other locations starting next week, a White House official told reporters ahead of an official announcement Wednesday. Each adult will get up to three masks, and ""we anticipate making additional, high-quality masks for children available in the near future,"" the official said. The masks will be shipped around the U.S. from the federal Strategic National Stockpile at the end of the week. The White House, which launched a website for ordering free COVID-19 tests on Tuesday, is stepping up the federal response to the flood of cases of the highly transmissible Omicron variant. ""This is the largest deployment of personal protective equipment in U.S. history,"" the White House official said. ""Experts agree that masking is an important tool to control the spread of COVID-19,"" especially the Omicron variant. The Centers for Disease Control advised last week that N95 or KN95 masks are more effective than disposable surgical masks, and ""loosely woven cloth coverings"" offer the least protection of any masks. The Strategic National Stockpile has more than 750 million N95 masks, and ""unlike earlier in the pandemic when severe shortages of personal protective equipment affected hospitals, forcing hospital staff to make homemade face shields and use bandanas, an ample supply of high-quality masks exists for health-care workers,"" The Washington Post reports. ""Those masks are also widely available to the public online and in stores."" ""I know that for some Americans, a mask is not always affordable or convenient to get,"" President Biden acknowledged last week. And ""I know we all wish that we could finally be done with wearing masks. I get it. But ... they're a really important tool to stop the spread."" While Biden is urging people to mask up in public indoor spaces, he hasn't asked state or local governments to require them for the public at large. That sets the U.S. apart from every other Group of Seven country, all of which have mask mandates or widespread mask-wearing, said Julia Raifman, an assistant professor at Boston University.

1/20/2022,"Thad Cummings, 31, is a registered nurse who works in emergency rooms in Michigan and North Carolina. He told Insider his pandemic experiences, including conversations shifting from ""Hey, you're sick"" to ""Hey, you're dying."" This is his story, as told to writer Jenny Powers. This story is based on a conversation with Thad Cummings, 31, a registered nurse who works in emergency rooms in Michigan and North Carolina. It has been edited for length and clarity. My hands visibly shook as the anesthesiologist directed me to inject the sedatives into the IV line attached to the not-yet 40-year-old mother with COVID-19 who was begging me not to let her die. Only one week before, this woman had learned she'd tested positive for COVID-19. Within just a few days, her lungs began to fail her and the conversation quickly turned from ""Hey, you're sick"" to ""Hey, you're dying."" It was November 2020, and I had only been a registered nurse for a month at that point. I'd earned my nursing license over the summer and subsequently passed my nursing exam that fall. By that fall, I found myself inside a local COVID-19 ICU doing everything I could to make myself useful. It all depends on how you look at it. In my career, I go wherever I am most needed. Most of the time, that means rotating between two states — Michigan and North Carolina — regularly. I pull a 30- to 40-hour workweek at Mercy Health in Muskegon, Michigan, filling in gaps in the hospital's schedule while my daughter is at school. With joint custody, I fly to Charlotte, North Carolina, during the weeks I don't have her. There, I work at a community hospital called Atrium Health for up to 80 hours during a six-day window. I know flying during a pandemic presents an added health risk, but I never take my mask off during a flight under any circumstances. Upon arrival, I change into surgical scrubs, don an N-95 mask topped by a surgical mask, and I follow that up with a pair of goggles or a face shield. Then, I cover my body with a plastic suit and my hands with two pairs of nitrile gloves. Within minutes, like most of our patients, I find it hard to breathe. Then I begin sweating from head to toe as if I'm wrapped tightly inside a garbage bag. That's how I remain for most of my shift up to 14 hours a day. Walking the halls of the hospital, my senses are constantly assaulted by everything, from alarms signaling people's last breaths to desperate cries for help. So, on the day that mother pleaded for her life, I gazed into her panicked brown eyes and gave her hand a comforting squeeze. Rather than provide false hope, I said nothing as the medication infiltrated her nervous system and rendered her comatose, the first step in the intubation process — which, while a last resort, was a necessary one in the early days of the pandemic. According to the anesthesiologist on duty that day, only 10 patients had survived intubation on this particular floor since COVID-19 reared its ugly head in March. This young mother, whose final act before losing consciousness was making the sign of the cross, would not be of them. The intubation process requires a patient to be put into a medically-induced coma. Then a tube is inserted into their airway and connected to a ventilator that pushes air into the lungs and removes it. It takes 20 to 30 minutes for a team of six or seven to intubate a single patient. With staff already stretched thin and an overflow of patients, often there was no time for patients to even call loved ones before we'd storm in and get to work, racing against the clock. Most of the time, despite all our efforts, they die anyway. During my first two weeks on the job at Mercy Health in Michigan, I watched as four of the five hospital floors were converted into a COVID-only ward. Every day, I woke up to do battle on the frontlines in what can only be accurately described as a war zone. We were in complete disaster mode, surrounded by trauma and loss. I got COVID-19 in April 2020. Then, two weeks into my job, I got it a second time and was required to quarantine once more. I experienced the hallmark symptoms of loss of taste and smell, headaches, fevers, low oxygen counts, and lung infection. It would be another two to three months before I could walk up a flight of steps again without losing my breath, which says a lot, since I'm a triathlete who prides myself on leading a healthy lifestyle. In 2021, I transitioned from the ICU to the emergency room when the Delta variant hit. One afternoon I caught up with a friend to grab a cup of coffee and try to indulge in a bit of normalcy. Turns out, the place we chose was filled with mask-less people who had just returned from a rally against COVID-19 vaccinations. Those people believed COVID was a hoax and part of a political agenda, but they've never seen the inside of an ER or ICU and witnessed the level of decimation I have. Try standing by as doctors tell parents their children are going to die, then tell me it's all a hoax. Despite people saying that Omicron is a milder variant, it's still wreaking havoc. Our emergency rooms continue to be flooded by people, many of whom have not only been vaccinated but have also had the booster. In Michigan, we're seeing more hospitalizations in this surge than we did last fall. Does this mean every person coming in is terribly ill? No. Some people with COVID-19 are driven by fear, so they come in despite being perfectly stable. Yet a fair number of people are in fact quite ill, and some don't even know how ill they are — to the point that they're coming in almost too late. The medical field now understands more about the virus than when it first arrived. For example, we may be slower to intubate someone and first treat them with a BiPAP machine, which is a positive-pressure ventilator that allows you to reach positive air pressure when you breathe in and out. It isn't that we treat Omicron differently than other variants; it's that our understanding and relationship to what may help people has evolved and continues to each day. We had a lady come in who was having a heart attack. On a normal day, we would stabilize the patient, and within two to three hours, she'd be in a neighboring hospital in a cath-lab receiving life-saving treatment. Instead, she spent eight days in the ER where I worked waiting for a bed. None were open. The implications and politics or personal beliefs on COVID-19 are lost to me, because the average citizen doesn't even grasp the greater impact on the community as a whole. Once you're ill, you come to the hospital regardless. Your beliefs are left behind at home with your Facebook posts. COVID-19 is very real. It isn't political and it doesn't discriminate. It doesn't care if you are a Republican or a Democrat. It doesn't care about your age, race or religion. It doesn't care that hospital staff is getting burnt out and leaving the field in droves, or that our resources are limited. I'm not asking anyone to stop living their life, but I am urging everyone to put politics aside and come together. COVID-19 hasn't only caused people to lose their lives — it's caused us to lose our humanity.

1/20/2022,"Eric Trump and Allen Weisselberg invoked the Fifth Amendment in the Trump Organization civil probe, a filing says. Both men took the Fifth more than 500 times in depositions, the NY attorney general's office said. The filing also accused Donald Trump of inflating his property values and misleading investors. Eric Trump and Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization's chief financial officer, each invoked their Fifth Amendment rights more than 500 times during depositions with the New York attorney general's office. That's according to a new court filing from Attorney General Tish James' office asking a judge to enforce subpoenas targeting former President Donald Trump and his two eldest children, Donald Jr. and Ivanka. James is spearheading a years-long civil investigation into the Trump Organization and its business dealings. Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump were subpoenaed on December 1 as part of the investigation. James also wanted the former president to sit for a deposition on January 7, which he did not do. Eric Trump appeared for a deposition in October 2020. Tuesday's court filing said he ""invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in response to more than 500 questions over six hours."" Weisselberg sat for a deposition in September 2020. ""At testimony held on September 24, 2020, after answering a number of preliminary questions, Allen Weisselberg invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination to more than 500 questions over five-and-a-half hours,"" the filing said. In response to James' announcement of the legal filing late Tuesday, Eric Trump tweeted: ""Letitia you can not escape your own words. This is all window dressing for your abuse of office and ethical misconduct (which we are prosecuting you for) and northing more than a PR move to revive a political career after your gubernatorial disaster."" A spokesperson for the Trump Organization also put out a statement accusing James of misleading the public and ""misrepresenting the facts"" surrounding the case. The statement went on to say that James' allegations are ""baseless and will be vigorously defended."" A person familiar with the investigation told The Washington Post last month that James was looking into whether rampant fraud ""permeated the Trump Organization."" Her investigation runs parallel to a criminal inquiry by the Manhattan district attorney's office that James' office is also collaborating on. The attorney general's office alleged in this week's court filing that Trump repeatedly inflated his property values and misled investors about his personal wealth. In one instance, the filing said, Trump personally signed documents falsely claiming that his triplex in Trump Tower was three times its actual size. Weisselberg also ""testified that it was 'certainly possible' Mr. Trump discussed valuations with him and that it was 'certainly possible' Mr. Trump reviewed the Statement of Financial Condition for a particular year before it was finalized,"" the filing said. In another instance, investigators said Trump personally intervened to seek a higher valuation of his golf clubs in Los Angeles. Specifically, the filing described Trump as saying in a 2014 phone call with an outside tax counsel and an appraiser that the properties should be ""valued higher than previously sold lots in the Trump Golf LA project because they were in a 'more prestigious' zip code and could thus command a 'zip code premium.'"" The appraiser subsequently asked the outside tax counsel ""to confirm whether the lots were in a different zip code,"" the filing said. ""Trump Organization in-house counsel concluded they were not."" Weisselberg and the Trump Organization were indicted on 15 felony counts including tax fraud and grand larceny as part of the Manhattan DA's investigation last year. Both pleaded not guilty. Trump, for his part, filed a lawsuit late last month accusing James of trying to ""harass"" him and his family with investigations. ""To be clear, neither Mr. Trump nor the Trump Organization get to dictate if and where they will answer for their actions,"" James' office said in response to the lawsuit. ""Our investigation will continue undeterred because no one is above the law, not even someone with the name Trump.""

1/20/2022,"Two siblings have pleaded guilty in the killing of 19-year-old Frank McAlister 30 years after his skeletal remains were found by hikers in Shingletown, California, allowing authorities to close the decades-old cold case. McAlister was reported missing by his then-girlfriend on May 7, 1993. She told authorities that he was driving her car, which was also missing, according to KRCR, a television station in Redding. Police said the car was later found at a Costco parking lot with what appeared a substantial amount of blood inside. McAlister had been in a car accident in March 1993 and had collected an insurance settlement check for at least $4,500 the day before he disappeared, according to the Record Searchlight. Authorities investigated the case for over 20 years but got nowhere until Brian Keith Hawkins confessed to the murder during a gut-wrenching interview with KRCR in 2018. He asked for a smoke and a soda before appearing on camera. “I’m going to turn myself in, next door at the sheriff’s department, for a crime I was involved in years ago,” he told the station. “And somebody lost their life. Murder.” Brian Hawkins Photo: Redding Police Department Hawkins said he was confessing because of his Christian faith and that he could no longer live with the guilt. “God and Christ and these things that have happened over the course of 25 years have pushed me to do the right thing. I know the wrong can’t be changed, but this is the closest I can come to doing the right thing.” Hawkins also named Curtis Culver and Shanna Culver as his accomplices. Both were taken into custody within hours of his confession. ""Horrible, horrible, horrible, absolute horror, absolutely horrible since that day. Every minute of every day has been a nightmare,"" Hawkins told the station. ""Frank never got to have a life, but we were teenagers and now I'm 44 and still haven't even had a life and now most likely won't anyway."" Police had long suspected that Hawkins and the Culvers were the last people to see McAlister alive and interviewed them several times as they investigated the case, but all three had repeatedly denied any involvement in his disappearance or knowledge of his whereabouts. Hawkins told police that they planned to rob McAlister. He was going to use the insurance money to buy methamphetamine, which he then planned to sell.  The trio used the drug sale to lure him to Shingletown. Hawkins and Curtis Culver stabbed the victim to death and left his body in the woods, according to the Redding Police Department.  They took his money and car and drove it back to Redding, leaving it in the Costco parking lot.  In November of 2019, Hawkins, now 48, pleaded guilty to murder in the first degree, robbery, and additional special allegations. He will be sentenced to 25 years to life in prison, according to the Shasta County District Attorney’s Office.  On Friday, Curtis, 49, and Shanna Culver, 45, pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter, robbery in concert and multiple assault charges. They’re scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 25.

1/20/2022,"Parallel Systems, a company founded by three former SpaceX engineers to build autonomous battery-electric rail vehicles, came out of stealth mode on Wednesday with a $49.55 million Series A raise. The company, which has raised $53.15 million to date, including a $3.6 million seed round, is working to create a more efficient, decarbonized freight network that flows on top of existing railway infrastructure. The funds will be used to build Parallel System's second-generation vehicle and launch an advanced testing program that will help the startup figure out how to integrate its vehicles into real-world operations, according to co-founder and CEO Matt Soule. Parallel Systems also intends to use the new investment -- which was led by Anthos Capital and includes investments from Congruent Ventures, Riot Ventures, Embark Ventures and others -- to hire about 60 engineers, most of whom will deal with software, says Soule. The startup's rail vehicle architecture aims to solve a few problems: carbon emissions in freight, supply chain constraints of trucking and limits of railway freight. In the U.S., rail network accounts for 28% of all freight movement, but most of that is bulk movement activity -- large trains that move primary resources like coal and lumber. A smaller portion of rail freight movement is referred to as intermodal activity, which essentially involves moving steel containers between a range of different modes of transportation, like boats and trucks. ""Rail has a lot of opportunity to grow when it comes to intermodal, and we focus on this because this is where we think there's competition and appetite for innovation,"" Soule told TechCrunch. Parallel's patent-pending vehicle architecture involves individually powered railcars that can load and transport standard shipping containers as a single or double-stacked load. They can join up to form ""platoons"" or split off to multiple destinations while en route, which means they don't need to hold large volumes of freight to make the service economical, although Soule says they can actually carry much more weight than trucks, which handle most freight transportation in the U.S. ""For the unit economics of freight trains to get competitive with trucks, you need really long trains, and you're amortizing the cost of that locomotive and crew over that one really long train,"" said Soule. ""When that becomes a problem is when you're figuring out where to park that big train, and the answer is, not many places."" Relying on long trains to transport goods means it's harder to do high-volume turnovers that handle all our e-commerce wonders because those trains can't always access urban communities or ports. They require specially built, large terminals to accommodate their physical size, said Soule. ""Our unit economics don't depend on a very big train,"" said Soule. ""We can move in smaller platoons and rather than dwelling all day for the unloading and loading operation, we're in and out within an hour or two, leaving room for other platoons to come in. It's the more efficient footprint and it enables things like serving ports and creating inland port shuttle systems so you can move the containers from a seaport to an inland port, which is often a better place for trucks to go and are closer to warehousing activities."" When it comes to autonomy, Parallel sees the railroad's closed network as the ideal operational design domain for safe and early commercialization of autonomous technology due to limited track access and centralized traffic control. It's important to note, however, that while Parallel's long-term vision seems promising, the company has yet to test on national networks -- it has been testing its prototype vehicle on a small rail in Los Angeles that's insulated from national networks. Rail in the U.S. is privately owned by owner-operators, which makes it difficult for Parallel to test its vehicles and the autonomous systems running the vehicles on a large scale. Parallel is targeting private rail companies as its customers, hoping to sell or lease its tools for them to operate the service on a day-to-day basis while offering a supporting role in terms of providing and integrating the technology. Until the startup gets a legacy railroad partner on board, it won't be able to see if its tech can handle real-world operations. The early-stage company is a few years off from developing tech that could go to market, says Soule, but it has an opportunity to own this sector of the market, particularly as shippers around the world not only want faster freight, but also cleaner freight. The company's platoon technology features self-propelled rail cars that push against each other to distribute the load, which, the company predicts, will lead to Parallel vehicles using just 25% of the energy compared to a semi-truck. ""The fundamental reason we're doing this is to accelerate the decarbonization of freight, but the problem that we see is rail's scale of operations is limited to a market it can serve,"" said Soule. ""So we're trying to embrace this energy efficiency, but then break down its operational and economic barriers at the same time. And by the way, we're making our powertrain electric, which further accelerates the decarbonization benefits because our grid itself is not clean. So when you look at a diesel truck, compared to what we're building, and looking at the average, real-world CO2content of the U.S. grid, we're going to be 90% less CO2 per mile to move a unit of freight with our technology versus a diesel truck today.""",Business/TechCrunch,"Former SpaceX engineers bring autonomous, electric rail vehicle startup out of stealth",https://news.yahoo.com/former-spacex-engineers-bring-autonomous-130022992.html
1/20/2022,"Ukraine is again looking warily over its eastern border as Russia threatens its territorial integrity. In recent weeks, a buildup of Russian troops along the Ukrainian border has rattled Western leaders fearful of an incursion similar to, or perhaps even more wide-ranging than, Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. Then, on Dec. 17, 2021, Vladimir Putin demanded that no former Soviet states, such as Ukraine, be added to NATO – the Western alliance that Ukraine has long expressed a desire to join – and that NATO cease all military cooperation in Eastern Europe. Such rhetoric harks back to the Cold War, when global politics revolved around an ideological struggle between a communist Eastern Bloc and a capitalist West. It also serves Russia’s ideological and political goal of asserting its position as a global power. As scholars of the politics and culture of Ukraine and Russia, we know that underpinning Putin’s goal is Russia’s historical view of Ukraine as a part of its greater empire, which at one time ranged from present-day Poland to the Russian Far East. Understanding this helps explain Putin’s actions, and how he leans into this view of Ukraine to advance his agenda. Ukraine today comprises 44 million people and is the second-largest nation by area in Europe. But for centuries, within the Russian Empire, Ukraine was known as “Malorossiya” or “Little Russia.” The use of this term strengthened the idea that Ukraine was a junior member of the empire. And it was backed by czarist policies dating from the 18th century that suppressed the use of the Ukrainian language and culture. The intention of these policies was to establish a dominant Russia and later strip Ukraine of an identity as an independent, sovereign nation. A similar ploy has been used to downplay Ukrainian independence in the 21st century. In 2008 Putin’s then-spokesman, Vladislav Surkov, claimed that “Ukraine is not a state.” Putin himself recently wrote an article claiming Russians and Ukrainians are “one people – a single whole.” This concept of a single people derives from the history of “Kyivan Rus” – the medieval federation that included parts of modern-day Ukraine and Russia and had as its center present day Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. In recent years, commemorations in Russia of Kyivan Rus’ history have increased in prominence and scale. In 2016, a 52-foot statue of Prince Vladimir of Kyiv, considered a saintly ruler by Ukrainians and Russians alike, was unveiled in Moscow. The statue caused consternation among Ukrainians. Placing a mammoth depiction of Vladimir in the center of Moscow signaled, to some, Russia’s attempt to own Ukraine’s history. The fact that it came just two years after Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the invasion of the eastern Ukrainian Donbass region didn’t help. The Donbass and Crimea are both home to large numbers of ethnic Russians and people who primarily speak Russian. In the years leading up to Russia’s military actions, Putin and his allies often invoked the concept of the “Russian World” or “Russkiy Mir” – the idea that Russian civilization extends to everywhere that ethnic Russians live. The ideology also asserts that no matter where Russians are in the world, the Russian state has a right and an obligation to protect and defend them. Ukraine – both in 2014 and with Putin’s seemingly increasingly belligerent stance now – provides the perfect landscape for this concept. And Russia has allegedly been promoting “Russian World” ideology through the arming of pro-Russian separatists in the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk since 2014. Viewing Ukraine as a country split between pro-Moscow ethnic Russians and pro-Western Ukrainians, however, is a gross oversimplification. Ukraine’s ethnic makeup today – with an especially large minority of Russians living in the east – reflects the country’s absorption into the Soviet Union from 1922. Ethnic Ukrainians lived across the country before it was incorporated into the Soviet Union. In 1932-33, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin orchestrated a famine that killed some 4 million Ukrainians in the eastern regions. The famine, known as “Holodomor,” made it possible for ethnic Russians to move into the territory of Ukraine. These new residents drove Stalin’s industrialization campaign. To this day, the Donbass remains the heart of Ukraine’s industrial economy. When Ukrainians voted for independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, all of its 24 “oblasts,” or regions – including Donetsk, Luhansk and Crimea – supported independence. The large minority of ethnic Russians – 17.3% of the population at Ukraine’s last census in 2001 – were included as Ukrainian citizens in an independent state. For the most part, they too voted for independence. For most of the first two decades after independence, ethnic Russians have lived peacefully with Ukrainians and the country’s other ethnic minorities. But that changed in 2010 when Viktor Yanukovych, a politician from Donetsk, became Ukraine’s president. Though he did not state outright that he preferred a pro-Russian future for Ukraine, many of his policies marked a move away from the pro-European policies of his predecessors and played into Vladimir Putin’s designs on Ukraine. Ukraine was on track to sign an association agreement with the European Union in 2013. Instead, Yanukovych decided to join an economic union with Russia. This set off mass protests around the country that resulted in Yanukovych’s being ousted. Putin then annexed Crimea on the pretext of protecting ethnic Russians living on that peninsula. Meanwhile, pro-Russian separatists took over multiple cities in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the hope that Russia would have a similar interest in protecting Russians in eastern Ukraine. But ethnic Russians and Russian speakers in Ukraine’s east did not automatically support the separatists or want to be part of Russia. Since 2014, some 1.5 million people have left the Donbass to live in other parts of Ukraine. Meanwhile, at least a million people have left for Russia. Many of those who remain in the territories occupied by separatists are now being offered a fast track to Russian citizenship. This policy allows Putin to increase pro-Russian sentiment in eastern Ukraine. While Putin claims that ethnic Russians living in Ukraine are part of the Russian World, in reality, ethnicity is not a predictor of political affiliation in Ukraine. In other words, being an ethnic Russian or a Russian speaker does not indicate that one sees oneself as part of the Russian World. Rather, across Ukraine, there has been an increase in sentiment of a strong, unified Ukrainian identity since 1991. Meanwhile, the vast majority of Ukrainians support entrance into NATO. Most Ukrainians see their future as a sovereign country that is part of Europe. But this directly contradicts Putin’s goals of expanding the Russian World. They are conflicting visions that help explain why Ukraine remains a flashpoint. [Get the best of The Conversation, every weekend.

1/20/2022,"A Georgia pastor has been charged with false imprisonment after police found eight people locked in his home’s basement, according to the Griffin Police Department. Curtis Keith Bankston and his wife, Sophia Simm-Bankston, were holding the eight as part of an unlicensed “group home” for people with disabilities, police said in a news release. Investigators say Curtis Bankston, 55, identifies himself as pastor of a church known as One Step of Faith 2nd Chance. The discovery was made Jan. 13, when the Griffin Fire Department and a team of EMTs responded to a report of someone having a seizure at a home on Valley Road in Griffin, officials said. The city is about 35 miles southeast of Atlanta. “Personnel noticed the entry door to the basement was double keyed (dead bolted), and access had to be gained by climbing through a window to reach the patient,” police said. “Preliminary information indicated as many as eight individuals resided in the basement ... and that they were ‘locked in’ at certain times by the ‘caretakers.’” The home has been under lease for the past 14 months, and its basement was being used “as a personal care home for the individuals, which essentially imprisoned them against their will,” police said. The eight individuals were identified as “mentally and/or physically disabled.” Investigators called the arrangement “an extreme hazard,” because the eight would not be able to exit the basement in an emergency. A search warrant found evidence the site was operated “under the guise” of One Step of Faith 2nd Chance church. The arrangement put the couple “in control of the disabled individual’s finances, medications and public benefits,” police said. “These individuals had been denied their medications and, in some cases, medical care,” police said. The eight, including five who are wards of the state, have been placed “into suitable care and housing” by the state’s Department of Human Services, officials said. Independent investigations were conducted by the Division of Aging Services and the Department of Human Services, resulting in Curtis Bankston being arrested and charged with false imprisonment, officials said. The investigation is ongoing, and additional charges are likely, officials said. “It is both frightening and disgusting to see the degree to which these individuals have been taken advantage of by people who were in a position of trust,” police officials said in the release. “The City of Griffin, along with D.H.S., will continue to use any resources available to ensure this doesn’t happen again.” Police stop van they thought was stolen in Georgia — and find flock of sheep inside Sheriff’s office shares grim photo after Alabama deputy’s ear was ‘torn and bitten’ School cafeteria fight ends with mom arrested for using mace on student, NC cops say",U.S./Macon Telegraph,"Pastor had 8 people locked in basement as part of illegal group home, Georgia cops say",https://news.yahoo.com/pastor-had-8-people-locked-145340459.html
1/20/2022,"MOSCOW (AP) — Russia maintained a tough posture Wednesday amid the tensions over its troop buildup near Ukraine, with a top diplomat warning that Moscow will accept nothing less but “watertight” U.S. guarantees precluding NATO's expansion to Ukraine. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, who led the Russian delegation at the security talks with the U.S. in Geneva last week, reaffirmed that Moscow has no intentions of invading Ukraine as the West fears, but said that receiving Western security guarantees is an imperative for Moscow. The talks in Geneva and a related NATO-Russia meeting in Brussels last week were held as Russia has amassed an estimated 100,000 troops near Ukraine in what the West fears might herald an invasion. Amid the soaring tensions, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Ukraine on Wednesday to reassure it of Western support in the face of what he called “relentless” Russian aggression. In Strasbourg, French President Emmanuel Macron urged the European Union to quickly draw up a new security plan containing proposals to help ease tensions with Russia. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Wednesday that talks between Blinken and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov set for Friday in Geneva are “extremely important.” In a move that further beefs up forces near Ukraine, Russia has sent an unspecified number of troops from the country’s far east to its ally Belarus, which shares a border with Ukraine, for major war games next month. Ukrainian officials have said that Moscow could use Belarusian territory to launch a potential multi-pronged invasion. The Russian Defense Ministry said Wednesday that some troops already have arrived in Belarus for the Allied Resolve 2022 drills that will run through Feb. 20. It said the exercise will be held at five firing ranges and other areas in Belarus and involve four Belarusian air bases. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Wednesday it's too early to tell whether talks could defuse the crisis, adding that “after years of rising tensions, staying silent is not a sensible option.” “The Russian side is aware of our determination,” Scholz told the World Economic Forum. “I hope they also realize that the gains of cooperation outweigh the price of further confrontation.” Russia has denied that it intends to attack its neighbor but demanded guarantees from the West that NATO will not expand to Ukraine or other former Soviet nations or place its troops and weapons there. It also has urged NATO to roll back the deployments of its troops and weapons to Central and Eastern European nations that have joined the alliance after the end of the Cold War. Washington and its allies firmly rejected Moscow’s demands but kept the door open to possible further talks on arms control and confidence-building measures to reduce the potential for hostilities. Ryabkov insisted, however, that there can't be any meaningful talks on those issues if the West doesn't heed the main Russian requests for the non-expansion of NATO. He warned that the Russian demands “constitute a package, and we're not prepared to divide it into different parts, to start processing some of those at expense of standing idle on others.” The Russian diplomat said Ukraine's increasingly close ties with NATO allies pose a major security challenge to Russia. “We see the threat of Ukraine becoming ever more integrated in NATO without even acquiring a formal status of a NATO member state,” Ryabkov said, pointing at Western powers supplying Ukraine with weapons, training its troops and conducting joint drills. “This is something that goes right to the center of Russia's national security interests, and we will do our utmost to reverse this situation.” Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 after mass protests prompted Ukraine’s Moscow-friendly leader to flee to Russia. At the same time, Russia also cast its support behind a separatist insurgency that swept over large areas in eastern Ukraine. More than 14,000 people have been killed in nearly eight years of fighting there. Asked if Russia could accept a moratorium on NATO's expansion eastward, an idea circulated by some political experts, Ryabkov answered with a firm no, saying that Moscow has seen the West backtrack on previous promises. He emphasized that ""for us, the matter of priority is achievement of watertight, bulletproof, legally binding guarantees” that Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations will not join the alliance. Ryabkov suggested that the U.S. could also take a unilateral obligation to never vote for NATO membership for Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations. Russia has urged the U.S. and NATO to provide a quick written response. Peskov told reporters Russia expects to receive it “within days.” ___ Matthew Lee in Kyiv, Ukraine and Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this report.",World/Associated Press,Russia says it will take nothing less but NATO expansion ban,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-says-nothing-less-nato-131712181.html
