1/12/2022,"It was the year that millions of urban dwellers plotted – or daydreamed about – a move to a more isolated location, with a small Scottish island, remote Cumbrian villages and the Isle of Man all featuring in a list of homebuyer search hotspots for 2021. The pandemic has prompted many people to look at quitting their homes in the town or city and relocating somewhere with more open space or more room for working from home.  Rhos-on-Sea, a small seaside town in north Wales near Colwyn Bay, topped property website Rightmove’s list of the 10 most popular hotspots, all of which are either villages or located near the sea. However, the site also found that during the final months of 2021, London snatched back its crown as the most searched-for major area – suggesting that, as lockdowns lifted and restrictions eased, many would-be homebuyers underwent a reality check. Sandwiched between Llandudno and Colwyn Bay, Rhos-on-Sea is popular with daytrippers, with a population of less than 8,000. Searches for properties in the town were up 858% on 2020. In fourth was the village of Breage in deepest Cornwall, located a few miles from Helston and 20 miles from Land’s End. In fifth place on the list was the Isle of Man, with its “favourable tax regime” and low crime rate. Unlike other offshore jurisdictions, there is no limit on buying or renting property on the island. In sixth and 10th place were villages in Cumbria: Frizington, situated a few miles from the Lake District national park, and Allonby, which boasts a long sandy beach and views across the Solway Firth to the mountains of southern Scotland. The town of Huntly in Aberdeenshire, just under an hour’s drive north-west of Aberdeen, was in seventh place, and in eighth was Millport, the only town on Cumbrae, off the Ayrshire coast, which has been dubbed “Scotland’s most accessible island”. The seaside village of Thorpeness in Suffolk came in ninth place. Perhaps a little more familiar to many were the second- and third-placed hotspots. Hove in East Sussex, just to the west of Brighton, saw home searches up 680% on 2020, while in third came the village of Chadlington in the Oxfordshire Cotswolds – the epicentre of broadcaster Jeremy Clarkson’s foray into agriculture, as depicted in his Amazon Prime reality show, Clarkson’s Farm. In terms of major areas, London is historically the most searched-for location on Rightmove; however, in January and February 2021, and then from May until September, Cornwall led the way. But after that, London took the top spot again and kept it. Rightmove said these findings reflected “changed buyer preferences” in 2021, when more people looked for homes near coastal areas as they spent time working from home, while the return of London to the top of searches later in the year highlights its returning popularity.",Lifestyle/Money,Escape to the country?

1/12/2022,"UK households have suffered the sharpest fall in the amount of cash they have available to spend for almost eight years, amid a worsening cost of living crisis driven by high inflation and rising energy bills. According to a report by the insurer Scottish Widows, increasing living costs at the end of last year hit people’s pockets and led to the steepest decline in cash availability since the start of 2014.  It said people were increasingly pessimistic about their future finances in 2022, according to the latest reading from its quarterly household finance index. The poll of 1,500 individuals, compiled by Ipsos Mori and IHS Markit on behalf of the insurer, found that pressure intensified on savings and disposable income in the final months of 2021, with both declining quicker than at anytime in over the past seven years. The index, which measures households’ overall perceptions of financial wellbeing, fell from 44 in the third quarter to 40.1 in the final quarter of 2021, the lowest reading since the second quarter of 2020 when Covid-19 first spread. A figure above 50 signals an improvement as opposed to a deterioration. It comes as a separate report from the Royal Society for Arts said young adults were among the hardest hit by the cost of living crisis, in a warning that the damage to their finances from inflation, student debt, and rising taxes risked creating a new “generation precariat”. According to a survey of 1,000 young adults by the thinktank, researchers found almost half (47%) were unable or just about managing to make ends meet each month, or had an income that varied significantly from paycheck to paycheck. With inflation at the highest level in a decade, ministers are coming under growing pressure to act on living standards ahead of an expected sharp increase in gas and electricity prices for British consumers from April. According to the RSA study, carried out as part of an inquiry by the Health Foundation thinktank into young people’s health, those living in financially precarious situations were far more likely to be worried about their mental and physical health. It found that just 41% of young people believed others like them would ever be able to buy their own home, and only 51% thought they would ever earn enough to support a family. Just over half (51%) said they thought young people like them would not be able to retire and live comfortably when the time comes. The researchers said young adults risked a tougher squeeze than other age groups as the government’s “national living wage” for under-23s was lower than the headline rate of £8.91 an hour. The legal pay floor will go up to £9.50 from April for those aged 23 and over, while there will also be increases for those in younger age brackets. The RSA also noted that the government was considering lowering the repayment threshold on student loans to £22,000 from £27,295 at present, which would have the effect of reducing incomes for graduates. Fran Landreth Strong, an RSA researcher and lead author of the report, said: “Young people across the UK face a toxic cocktail of inadequate work and safety nets, high levels of debt, and a rising cost of living. “Our research shows that this results in a worrying number of young people facing financial precarity, with significant impact on their mental and physical health and their confidence about the future. Without proper action, we risk creating a ‘generation precariat’, unable to invest in their futures and move confidently into adulthood.”",News/Business,UK households suffer biggest fall in available cash in eight years,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/12/uk-households-suffer-biggest-fall-in-available-cash-in-eight-years
1/12/2022,"The rollout of smart motorways has been suspended by the government until at least 2025 in response to safety concerns from MPs and motoring groups. Schemes to convert stretches of the M3, M25, M62 and M40 will be put on ice until five years’ worth of safety data from the controversial roads are available, ministers said.  The government has promised a £900m package of additional safety measures on existing smart motorways in the meantime, including building more emergency refuge areas for vehicles in difficulty. Smart motorways, which were introduced to increase road capacity and manage traffic by converting the hard shoulder to a live running lane, have been heavily criticised by safety campaigners – particularly relatives of people who have died in crashes after being left unable to find safe refuge when their vehicles broke down. The government’s change of tack comes in response to a report by the cross-party transport select committee demanding a halt to the programme and a number of safety enhancements. While the Department for Transport said that available data shows that smart motorways are the safest roads in the UK in terms of fatalities, it has agreed to have the technology independently evaluated by the regulator, the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), and to suspend the new schemes pending the full five years’ worth of safety data across the so-called “all lane running” motorways converted over the past decade. The first smart motorways were either known as “controlled”, with a permanent hard shoulder as well as the electronic signage that imposes temporary, changeable speed limits, or “dynamic”, where the hard shoulder is used at peak times. In a review of smart motorways commissioned by transport secretary, Grant Shapps, in March 2020, the government said dynamic smart motorways were confusing and should be phased out in favour of all-lane running, removing the hard shoulder permanently. However, MPs on the transport committee said that the decision was premature and based on insufficient evidence. The government says it will also pause the conversion of seven dynamic smart motorways to all-lane running while it assesses the data, before making a decision on next steps – but made clear, for now, that it did not believe that safety would be improved by reinstating the hard shoulder on motorways, as called for by many campaigners. In its formal response to the committee’s report, the DfT noted the conclusion of MPs that evidence suggested reducing motorway capacity “could put more drivers and passengers at risk of death or serious injury if they were to divert on to less safe local roads, and that hard shoulders do not provide a safe place to stop”. The government said it would now spend another £390m on installing more than 150 additional emergency refuge areas on existing smart motorways, about 50% more than at present, by 2025, on top of the £500m spend on retrofitting more stopped vehicle detection technology promised after Shapps’ 2020 stocktake. Shapps said he had tried to “raise the bar” on safety, adding: “While our initial data shows that smart motorways are among the safest roads in the UK, it’s crucial that we go further to ensure people feel safer using them. “Pausing schemes yet to start construction and making multimillion-pound improvements to existing schemes will give drivers confidence and provide the data we need to inform our next steps.” Smart motorways already under construction will, however, be completed, the DfT said. That includes stretches of the M1, M4 and M6 due to be finished in 2022 or 2023. The DfT said failing to complete them would cause “significant disruption” for drivers. The chief executive of National Highways, Nick Harris, said existing motorways would be made safer “and we will step up our advice to drivers so they have all the information they need”. Motoring organisations and road safety campaigners welcomed the news of the pause. Meera Naran, whose eight-year-old son, Dev, died in a crash on the M6 in 2018, said it was “a positive opportunity to assess the future of our motorway network”. The RAC said it was a “watershed decision [and] an unqualified victory for drivers” while the AA said it had met a key demand, that emergency refuge areas should be no more than three-quarters of a mile apart. Huw Merriman MP, chair of the transport committee, credited ministers for revisiting the issue so soon and accepting the safety recommendations. He said: “It was clear that the public needs more reassurance that these motorways are safe to use.” However, former roads minister Mike Penning MP, who signed off several smart motorway schemes but has since spoken out against them, said he remained deeply concerned. “Either we are happy that all-lane running is safe or we’re not,” he said. “If there is any reasonable doubt, which there clearly is … then we should stop using them.”",News/UK news,Smart motorway rollout suspended amid safety concerns,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/12/smart-motorway-rollout-suspended-amid-safety-concerns
1/12/2022,"Pausing the rollout of smart motorways suggests the government has finally bowed to the inevitable, faced with the collective outrage of motoring groups, bereaved families, newspapers, MPs – and indeed a former minister who signed off the schemes. Not, though, that the small print guarantees drivers have in any way seen the end of the hard shoulderless highways: ongoing major works will be completed, and even design work will go ahead for more stretches, in case the mood changes by 2025.  For now, that decision awaits more data. The trouble is that the cold data has yet to convince drivers who feel instinctively that the motorways are unsafe. While the accident statistics, as the Department for Transport continues to point out, show that smart motorways are the safest roads in the country – in terms of fatal incidents involving motorists by a significant margin, per mile, compared with A-roads – it is the circumstances of those fatalities, rather than the numbers, which have appalled. In several cases, people died in their cars long after breaking down and calling for assistance; unable to make it to a place of safety, hit by other vehicles at high speed. Inquiries have heard harrowing testimony, including the final, recorded conversations of victims. And coroners as well as relatives have concluded that the deaths were due to the layout of the motorways. Roads which were initially trialled with more refuge areas, or hard shoulders only used at peak times, with technology to manage speed and to detect stopped vehicles, have been rolled out without the same levels of protection. Until today’s decision, the government had affirmed that all smart motorways would be converted to all-lane running, ie without a hard shoulder at any point. Grant Shapps’ stocktake in 2020 was an acknowledgment that drivers feared they could not be reached in the event of trouble, without a clear passage for emergency vehicles. Safety measures, from greater retrofitting of technology and clamping down on motorists ignoring the red Xs signals, were inadequate reassurance. Nonetheless, the reasons that compelled ministers to move from trials in 2006 to mass introduction of smart motorways from 2014 remain. More and more traffic, barely dented by Covid restrictions, and less tolerance of new roads. Drivers are the most impacted by the work to convert motorways – rather than say, the neighbouring residents or surrounding countryside blighted by building a new road. Eating up the hard shoulder provides a relatively cheap, efficient, and less environmentally intrusive way of expanding the network – although green campaigners have made clear that the rollout, encouraging more traffic, is barely compatible with climate commitments. A pause until 2025 will also save hundreds of millions of pounds on road contracts, not insignificant after the Treasury blocked planned rail investment – the kind of spending that was supposedly popular. Suspending the programme may have become a political no-brainer but the DfT’s constraints suggest any motorways built after 2025 will probably remain, more or less, “smart”.",News/UK news,Ditching the hard shoulder proved too hard a sell to MPs and motorists,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/12/ditching-the-hard-shoulder-proved-too-hard-a-sell-to-mps-and-motorists
1/12/2022,"Modern dating is a minefield at the best of times, let alone when you’re 40, living in a foreign country, widowed and the single father of an emotionally difficult 11-year-old. When we meet American expat Gary (Josh Gad), he’s being dumped in an Australian restaurant by a self-described empath who claims he’s not emotionally available enough. Soon after, Gary has a chance encounter with the beautiful Mary (Isla Fisher) when their cars collide, and is stunned when she manages to soothe his daughter Emma (Ariel Donoghue) during a panic attack – something he can’t do himself. Mary seems like a dream come true, but not all is as it seems.  Directed by Abe Forsythe and produced by Jodi Matterson (Nine Perfect Strangers), Bruna Papandrea (Big Little Lies) and Steve Hutensky (The Dry), this schlocky six-part series is choppy and confused, unsure of its purpose. Mary’s true identity is flagged in the title of the show, which has all the subtlety of a Twilight film – except that Twilight could be considered “so bad it’s good”, and this is really just the former. Mary is a kind of manic pixie dream wolf, playing the prospective stepmother of Emma’s dreams; she gives the girl a Carl Sagan novel, which Emma reads obsessively, and recommends a Queens of the Stone Age song, so Emma locks herself in a car to listen to it. The charm of Mary, for both Emma and her father, is the way in which she can cut through to some kind of emotional centre: through interacting with Mary, Emma is able to develop a new vocabulary that helps her in her therapy sessions. But does all this make Mary a good partner for Gary? Here’s where Wolf Like Me does, perhaps, succeed a little: illustrating the addictive, push-pull nature of toxic relationships. Just as we think Gary is out for good, something pulls him back towards Mary; Mary’s constant running away act is frustrating but understandable, given her fear of intimacy and judgment. Both characters elicit some sympathy from the viewer, but neither is particularly likable. The relationship is unhealthy on both sides and borders on emotional abuse, manipulation and boundary-crossing. It’s hard to watch without thinking both characters would be better off without the other. One early scene shows Gary ordering a cab driver to follow Mary home so he can see for himself what she’s up to. “You shouldn’t be following women like this, it’s 2021,” the driver says. This might be the show’s only real moment of self-awareness. Its depiction of women and race leaves a lot to be desired: the sole person of colour to appear in the show is an Asian woman Gary goes on a date with, who is only on the dating app to learn English. Wolf Like Me gets more ridiculous across the six 30-minute episodes, with Mary and Gary’s relationship developing at warp speed as their lives become more intertwined. The climax, in which Mary’s secret is finally shown on-screen, is laughably bad – the special effects and costuming leave a lot to be desired – but there’s a sweet father-daughter moment there, in which Gary finally finds a way to communicate with Emma. Still, the plot is nonsensical. It’s hard to tell what genre Wolf Like Me wants to be. Horror? Romcom? Drama? A mix of all three? Whatever it is, it falls flat. Wolf Like Me premieres on 13 January on Stan (Australia) and Peacock (US).",Arts/Television & radio,"Wolf Like Me review – so bad it’s good?
