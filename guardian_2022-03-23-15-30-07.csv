3/23/2022,"I’d happily watch Mads Mikkelsen sit in silence for an hour and a half. Whether he’s playing a weepy-eyed Bond villain, an alcoholic teacher, or the bloke who designed the Death Star, the Danish actor imbues all of his performances with a sort of brooding intensity that often transcends the need for any form of dialogue. That’s exactly why he’s the perfect casting for Arctic, an icy survival drama in which his deserted protagonist has no one to speak to, aside from himself, a barely conscious helicopter co-pilot and a very angry polar bear. Directed by Joe Penna, a former YouTuber making his feature debut, Arctic was initially screened at Cannes in 2018, but later went under the radar thanks to a limited theatrical release. Those who seek it out, though, will be treated to Mikkelsen’s finest performance yet. He’s excellent in The Hunt and Another Round, but here is a role that allows him to reach new emotional depths, expressing loneliness, fear, hope and despair with the most subtle of facial movements – and then effortlessly upping the ante when his quest for survival takes a more extreme turn. He is in fact so natural and convincing, you’d be forgiven for thinking he was actually stranded in this frozen-over hell. All we know about his character is that he’s called Overgård, and that he’s a pilot of some description. However, when we meet him at the beginning of the film, it becomes immediately apparent that he won’t be doing much flying, given that his plane has crash-landed in a remote part of the Arctic. We don’t know how long he’s been there, but it’s long enough for him to have fashioned the remains of his aircraft into a cosy little shelter. There’s something oddly therapeutic about Overgård’s isolated existence. In his solitude, he has built himself a regimented daily routine, catching fish from the water holes he’s drilled into the ice, sending out distress signals on a portable transmitter and maintaining the massive SOS sign he has carved into the snow. If it weren’t for the ever-present threat of frostbite and death, some travel agencies would probably advertise this as an idyllic getaway. In one of my favourite scenes, Overgård plucks an enormous Arctic trout from his ice hole and promptly cooks it with some salvaged instant noodles. It’s the tastiest and warmest meal he’s had in ages, and witnessing Mikkelsen’s sheer disbelief at its deliciousness is a magical thing to behold. Like a fine fish stew, though, the plot soon thickens when a helicopter – which should be his ticket out of the tundra – ends up crashing right in front of him. The pilot is dead, but the co-pilot (played by Maria Thelma Smáradóttir) is just about clinging on to life, albeit unconscious with a huge gash across her stomach. With barely enough medical supplies to keep her alive, Overgård makes the executive decision to strap his newfound companion to a sled and trek towards a distant outpost in the north, knowing full well that the treacherous journey will most likely afford them the same fate as Jack Nicholson at the end of The Shining. It’s an unrelenting mission, bringing to mind the sort of suffering witnessed in 127 Hours and The Revenant. There’s even a moment that feels directly inspired by the former, coming as a cruel twist of fate just seconds after Overgård is given a whiff of hope. As for that latter comparison, Mikkelsen doesn’t get to sleep inside the carcass of a frozen horse, but he does come face to face with an actual, real-life polar bear. No CGI or practical effects required. By my reckoning, that makes him infinitely harder than Leonardo DiCaprio. It’s quite amazing to think that Arctic is Penna’s first feature-length film. He’s so assured in every decision he makes, and the twists and turns are paced so perfectly that you simply can’t afford to look away from the screen. Though a juggernaut performance does virtually all the heavy lifting (quite literally at times), this is still an incredibly authentic and poignant exploration of the human will to survive, one that translates the world over thanks to its refreshing lack of dialogue. If someone told you this was the work of an award-winning director, you’d probably believe them.

3/23/2022,"Gambling addiction rates may be nine times higher than the betting industry claims, according to a landmark study that found 1.4 million people are being harmed by their own gambling, while a further 1.5 million are at risk. Published with the government weeks away from unveiling plans for a once-in-a-generation reform of gambling laws, the survey is part of a push by leading charity GambleAware to encourage more people to seek treatment. The online survey of more than 18,000 adults conducted in 2021 found that up to 2.8% of the population scored eight or higher on the problem gambling severity index, a measure used by experts to gauge harm suffered by individual gamblers. The rate rises significantly among men, with 3.7% deemed to have a problem and 7.5% at risk, indicating that more than a 10th of men are either struggling with gambling or in danger of doing so. Among women, addiction rates were 2%, with 4% in the at-risk category. Women were more likely to be among the 6% of the population, or 3.3 million people, classed as “affected others”, meaning that someone else’s gambling had an impact on them. Despite the high rates found by the survey, just 8,490 people received treatment from the National Gambling Treatment Service (NGTS) last year, GambleAware said, suggesting that for every one person receiving help, 160 who could benefit from it did not. The NGTS comprises services including GamCare, Gordon Moody and the Primary Care Gambling Service, offering confidential treatment and support for anyone experiencing gambling harms or problem gambling. Nine out of 10 people who completed treatment an NGTS service saw their condition improve, GambleAware said. YouGov’s estimate that 2.8% of people are suffering gambling-related harm is nine times higher than the 0.3% rate found by the Gambling Commission’s telephone survey, a measure that has been frequently cited by gambling industry lobbyists to indicate that addiction is on the decline. The YouGov figure is also far in excess of the 0.5% found in face-to-face studies performed for the NHS in 2016. GambleAware said this was likely due to methodology, as people taking part in online surveys may be disproportionately likely to be experiencing difficulty with gambling. However, it said that while YouGov’s figures were likely to be at the “upper bounds” of the true addiction rate, the survey had been carefully controlled to prevent the data being skewed. The charity suggested other surveys may be underestimating the true figure. A spokesperson for the Betting & Gaming Council, said: “We do not recognise these figures which are not supported by the Gambling Commission’s most recent research which showed rates of problem gambling have been falling, according to the regulator at 0.3% – down from 0.6% 18 months ago. That’s equivalent to a drop of 340,000 problem gamblers down to 170,000 – not 1.4 million suggested by GambleAware.” The national lottery remains the most popular activity, with 44% of adults taking part. But the fastest growing area is online slot machines and casino games, which carry significantly higher rates of addiction, according to previous NHS surveys. Anyone wanting to get help or support with gambling, for themselves or another, can contact the National Gambling Helpline on 0808 8020 133. Kevan Mailey, 46, began gambling aged seven or eight during his childhood in Glasgow and says it consumed him until he entered a 14-week residential treatment programme in 2018 at the Gordon Moody Clinic. “Gambling ruined my life for almost 30 years,” he said. “It started when I visited arcades when I was seven or eight and started becoming a problem when I was 13 and got my first job as a paperboy, spending all of my wages on the dog and horse races. Gambling impacted on almost every part of my life and if I hadn’t got the help I needed I know I wouldn’t be here any longer.” Mailey now works as a residential support worker for Gordon Moody in Beckenham, Kent. “It hasn’t been easy and I would still describe myself as an addict. That will never leave me. But through the treatment I received I now have the tools and support I need to keep myself out of harm’s way and falling into old habits.” Nicola Jacques, 36, is an “affected other”, the former wife of a compulsive gambler. She only discovered that he had been gambling for a decade when she discovered a message from a payday loan company. “When I first found the … message on my former partner’s phone, I was shocked and confused,” she said. “I had no idea what gambling disorder was, its components or complexities. I had no preparation for the devastating consequences it would have on our everyday family life.” “People often aren’t aware of the toll that being an ‘affected other’ of a loved one’s gambling can take on you.” Jacques said gambling-related harms she suffered included family breakdown and domestic violence. She now works with families affected by gambling at the Beacon Counselling Trust, which offers services in north-west England.",News/Society,Gambling addiction could be nine times higher than industry claims,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/23/gambling-addiction-could-be-nine-times-higher-than-industry-claims
3/23/2022,"All big experiences in our lives have two realities. There is what really happened. And there is the narrative, the story we tell ourselves and each other about what happened. Of the two, psychologists say it’s the narrative that matters most. Creating coherent stories about events allows us to make sense of them. It is the narrative that determines our reactions, and what we do next. Two years after the World Health Organization (WHO) finally used the word “pandemic” in its own story about the deadly new virus from Wuhan, narratives have multiplied and changed around the big questions. How bad is it? What should we do about it? When will it be over? The stories we embraced have sometimes been correct, but others have sown division, even caused needless deaths. Those stories aren’t finished – and neither is the pandemic. As we navigate what could be – if we are lucky – Covid’s transition to a present but manageable disease, it is these narratives we most need to understand and reconcile. What has really happened since 2020? And how does it still affect us now? The first narrative we got wrong was the widespread assumption that infectious disease is only a problem for poor countries. Most western countries failed to prepare as the virus raced across Asia – until horror stories began emerging from Italian hospitals. By then, in some places, it was too late. At least once we agreed a response was needed, most people were on board. “It may seem hard to believe today,” marvelled US pollsters at the Pew Research Center in a 2021 report, but in March 2020 there was “strong bipartisan support” for shutdown measures. But that initial consensus frayed faster than many remember. Two months later the US was widely split along party lines, and remained that way, with Republicans rejecting control measures and insisting Covid was mild, even a hoax. A year after that, just before the more deadly and contagious Delta variant hit, three in 10 Americans said the pandemic was over. Similar divides emerged in England, where Brexit supporters shared an “anti-establishment narrative” with US Republicans. Researchers have found that local support for Brexit was the strongest factor associated with higher Covid deaths and lower vaccination rates in British voting districts after October 2020, possibly because this group rushed to abandon protections: separate polling found Brexit supporters were most keen to drop masks. At the government level, Downing Street seemed to follow two narratives of its own: a libertarian preference for individual responsibility over collective action, and the conviction that we could either save lives or the economy, not both. This led to its plan in March 2020 to not actively contain the virus, as the WHO insisted and as east Asian countries were already doing, but to let it spread until everyone was immune. That only changed when epidemiologists calmly explained how many deaths it would entail. The trade-off between death and wealth too was disproved when Asian countries that locked down early and hard had fewer deaths and fared better economically. But in England both that and the individual responsibility narrative persisted. Jeremy Farrar, until recently a Sage member, described the repeated decisions by Downing Street to lift restrictions too soon or reimpose them too slowly as “libertarian”. These narratives and their effects are still with us. They clearly informed England’s recent “living with Covid” plan for dropping masks, closures, testing, even viral surveillance from April, even though cases of the even more contagious BA.2 version of Omicron were already climbing True, vaccines and antiviral drugs have blunted Covid’s impact, and getting vaccinated is a personal responsibility. But infectious disease is always profoundly collective, whether or not leaders find that ideologically congenial. Omicron is better than its forebears at breaking through our immunity. The many people whose age or medical condition makes them more likely to die if that happens, or who have suppressed immunity – perhaps only because they need an arthritis drug – cannot take “personal responsibility” for avoiding Covid if they must return to the office, surrounded by maskless people exercising their “individual freedom” to exhale asymptomatic Omicron. Meanwhile, even people who accepted Covid was serious and required a collective response have assumed the narrative would end with Covid going away, and 2019-style normality returning. Even some scientists initially hoped the virus would mutate too slowly to evade our immunity, we would contain its spread, and it would die out like its relative, Sars, in 2003. No such luck. We all want the disruption and anxiety to stop, but we won’t achieve that with policies that pretend the pandemic is over when it isn’t. Moreover, things could get worse: the virus will keep evolving as long as it circulates, and Covid has shown that another widely held narrative, that diseases always evolve to be milder, is mere wishful thinking. And it looks set to keep circulating. So far, vaccines do not stop vaccinated people from catching and spreading it. So, of course, do the many people who remain unvaccinated. For some, the narrative of mistrust of science or government means they refuse. Others simply live in poor countries, and rich countries insist on another widely approved narrative: vaccinate our own first, even if that lets the virus keep evolving elsewhere, possibly into one that comes back to us and evades our vaccines. Between that and the many animal species that can host it, Covid will not go away. The best we can hope for is that one day we will not need to disrupt our lives to live with it. Some disruptions will become normal: more working from home, masks, testing. Better vaccines, drugs and treatments for long Covid will, we hope, make the disease less likely to kill or damage, at least those with access to them. Eventually Covid may infect us all as children, leaving lasting if partial immunity, perhaps becoming just another common cold. Living with Covid is, in fact, how this comes out, although we will not be there by April. But that isn’t the end of the pandemic story, only this chapter. Even if we fight Covid into normality, scientists agree there will be another pandemic, and more likely sooner than later. To stop that we must learn to spot and contain worrying outbreaks. To do this we must see through yet another misleading story: an “outbreak narrative” that portrays pandemics as primarily a sudden and unexpected battle between microbe and hero scientists seeking the cure. This cuts out the long backstory of deforestation, wildlife trade or risky farming that makes it more likely germs will jump from animals to us in the first place. These are causes we could address for a fraction of the cost the diseases spawned that way already cost us. But our experience – our story – of Covid, locked down until scientists found the vaccine, strengthens the outbreak narrative. Governments may assume they can react after the next one strikes too, without spending on being prepared. But a closer reading shows we were incredibly lucky: we found safe, effective vaccines faster than expected (vaccines for some coronaviruses have proved impossible), and meanwhile the disease wasn’t too deadly. Sars was 10 times more likely to kill you once infected. We desperately need a multinational effort to watch for new infections, and devise remedies. The WHO says we need to spend $31bn annually. Will we? As always it depends on the narrative. Is Covid over? No. Will there be another pandemic? Yes. Can we stop it? Maybe. It may all depend on the stories we tell ourselves now.

3/23/2022,"A Russian couple who staged a solitary protest against their government’s invasion of Ukraine is thought to be among the first to have claimed asylum in the UK since the war started. The couple, Anya and Igor (changed names), both 28, who cannot be identified because of the risk to themselves and to their families in Russia, protested with anti-war placards saying: “No to Russian aggression in Ukraine. No to war,” in the main square of their home town in the south of Russia on 24 February, the day Russia invaded its neighbour. They said that most people in the town are supportive of Vladimir Putin and of the Russian invasion. One other woman in the town staged a lone protest earlier the same day and was arrested. “When I protested an old lady walked past and said: ‘You are crazy, you need to change your position,’” said Anya. Anya made a donation of €50 (£42) to an organisation providing humanitarian aid to Ukrainians. She was later horrified to discover that Russia had passed a new law making this kind of donation a criminal offence. “Every hour new laws are passed now in Russia,” she said. “We call them ‘crazy printer’ laws because there are so many of them,” said Anya. Last year, never believing that rumours of war would translate into reality, they applied for and obtained visitor visas to see their friends in the UK. After deciding that they had to flee Russia they escaped to Armenia and then Georgia although they were “intensely” questioned at the border by Russian officials about where they were going and for how long. They then were able to get a flight from Georgia via Turkey to the UK. “We arrived at Stansted Airport and claimed asylum immediately. The Border Force officials seemed surprised to see us. I think we were the first Russians they had seen who had reached UK and claimed asylum since the war started. Russians who want to escape are going to countries like Georgia and Turkey. It’s very difficult for them to reach the UK.” Igor said that Russians have been bombarded with propaganda by the government for the past eight years since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. “Russians value comfort over freedom. Maybe when there is no food left in the fridge they will start to wake up to what is going on. Now in Russia we have what we call ‘desugarisation’ because it is hard to get hold of sugar,” said Anya. “It’s hard to comprehend what is going on inside Putin’s head but I think he has always been the way he is now. Before he had a mask on but now he can’t be bothered to wear it any more,” she added. Anya and Igor are waiting anxiously for their asylum claim to be processed. “We are self-loathing Russians at the moment,” said Igor. “This war is bringing nothing but death and destruction. Apart from the atrocities being committed against Ukrainians, it will throw Russia back a few decades at least,” said Anya. “When we did our demonstration in our home town we were not doing it as political activists. We are not Pussy Riot! We protested on the first day of the war because we felt morally obliged to show we are against it. We would never have forgiven ourselves if we had stayed silent.”",News/UK news,Russian couple who protested against war in Ukraine claim asylum in UK,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/23/russian-couple-who-protested-against-war-in-ukraine-claim-asylum-in-uk
3/23/2022,"Three girls have been held in an all-boys prison for at least eight months owing to “appalling” and systemic failures in the prison system, MPs and campaigners have said. The girls, aged 15 to 18, were transferred to the UK’s biggest prison for boys following the enforced closure of a privately run centre for safety reasons last year, the Guardian has learned. The teenagers have been held at the previously all-male Wetherby young offenders’ institute in West Yorkshire since last June. An inspection report found that they self-harmed and were subject to pain-inducing restraint techniques on 12 occasions – a higher proportion than the boys – according to an inspection report. Carolyne Willow, director of the children’s rights charity Article 39, said it was “appalling” that highly vulnerable children were “being put into completely the wrong environment and predictably suffering harm as a result”. She added: “It is unforgivable that ministers and statutory child welfare agencies were not able to work together to find a humane alternative to locking up three girls in the country’s largest prison for boys.” A cross-party group of MPs said the detention of the three girls alongside 140 boys represented a failure in effective planning at national level. The girls were taken to Wetherby after being moved from Rainsbrook secure training centre (STC), which was closed by the government after it emerged that children were being locked up for more than 23 hours a day. In June last year, the government announced the immediate closure of Rainsbrook, in Warwickshire, after the contractors, MTC Novo, failed to deliver changes ordered by the then justice secretary, Robert Buckland, following a damning report that exposed serious safety concerns. At the time, the Ministry of Justice said the 33 children, boys and girls would be taken to safe and secure centres across the youth prison estate. The Guardian has learned that three girls were transferred to the all-male Wetherby prison. They are held on a wing separate from the 140 boys. MPs Jackie Doyle-Price and Debbie Abraham, co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on women in the penal system, said it was “unacceptable that the three girls have been placed in Wetherby because of a failure at a national level to plan effectively”. They added: “Ministers must look again at this situation and come up with a sustainable long-term solution that ensures girls get the care and support they need.” A report on youth jail by the chief inspector of prisons, Charlie Taylor, was published last week. Taylor found Wetherby’s use of pain-inducing restraint techniques were the highest of all comparable prisons. The three girls had been restrained 12 times in the six months they had been at Wetherby at that point, significantly higher than the rate for boys. And of the 348 incidents of self-harm in six months, 14 were suffered by the three girls. The inspection, last December, criticised aspects of the environment and regime for all inmates. It says children spent less than six hours a day out of their cells, reduced to four hours at weekends, which inspectors said was not enough, noting the accommodation on the wings as “prison like” and some of the exercise yards “resembled those in high security jails”. Inspectors observed “children standing around in bare yards with nothing to do”. However, inspectors said children in crisis or at risk of self-harm had spoken positively about the support they received at the jail. One child told them:” It’s the best support I have ever had, in or out of prison.” The Wetherby inspection report found that three-quarters of the children had been in the care of their local authority at some point before custody. Nearly 30% had been excluded from school, and nearly a third were not in education, employment or training before custody. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “Inspectors recognised that staff at HMP Wetherby have rapidly created a caring and supportive environment for the small number of girls placed there after the closure of Rainsbrook STC. “The Keppel unit is separate from the rest of the population and has been adapted temporarily to support the needs of girls.”",News/Society,Three girls in England held in male offender institution for months,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/23/three-teenage-girls-male-offenders-institution-months
3/23/2022,"Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has inspired an unprecedented global response. Governments have supplied aid and arms to Ukrainians and organized severe sanctions against Russia’s economy, in the hopes of pressuring the Kremlin to back down. Ordinary people around the world are finding their own ways to resist Russian aggression. The desire to do something, anything, as civilians are being massacred is part of what makes us human. It’s easy to feel powerless in the face of this much violence, so even small acts of protest can be meaningful. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has requested Americans stop buying from companies that have continued to do business with Russia – including the parent companies of Dunkin’ Donuts, Reebok and Subway – so it’s understandable people don’t want to find themselves on the wrong side of efforts to aid Ukraine. But that doesn’t mean everything is helpful. Since the invasion began, we’ve been seeing some reactions that come across less as solidarity and more as empty symbolism, if not outright xenophobia. Earlier this month, a group of small-town officials in New York gathered news crews to watch them dump bottles of vodka on to the pavement. This follows bans on the sale of Russian vodka by at least 11 US states, and protests from bar owners around the country, including Bob Quay of Bob’s Bar in Grand Rapids, Michigan, who stopped serving Stolichnaya last month after learning about US sanctions against Russia and deciding he “would put on sanctions as well”. The reality is less than 1% of US vodka imports are actually made in Russia. Stolichnaya – which rebranded as Stoli this month – is produced in Latvia and was founded by a Putin critic who was exiled from Russia in 2000. Svedka? Made in Sweden. Smirnoff? Made in the USA. As one liquor store wrote in a note to its customers recently: “No need to dump them out anywhere except your glass.” Vodka isn’t the only “Russian” product being targeted regardless of actual Russianness. Rick Anderson, a North Carolina deli owner, made headlines last week when he renamed Russian dressing “Ukrainian dressing”, which he said “tastes just like our old dressing, without the notable hints of genocide”. He should rest assured that, just like French dressing and Italian dressing, Russian dressing was created in the US – sauce historians believe it originated in New Hampshire. Some restaurateurs have gone to extremes to avoid any association with the war. Le Roy Jucep, a Quebec diner that claims it invented the celebrated Canadian dish poutine, announced earlier this month it would no longer use that name over fears that it sounds too close to the Russian leader’s name in French. Instead, it’s calling poutine “fries-cheese-gravy”. The restaurant wrote on Facebook: “Tonight the Jucep team decided to temporarily retire the word P**tine from its trademark in order to express, in its own way, its profound dismay over the situation in Ukraine,” before deleting the post shortly after. But others have shown awareness that protesting against Russian food can only do so much. Last week, Wisconsin’s National Mustard Museum replaced its Russian mustard with a sign promising the condiment’s return “once the invasion of Ukraine is over and Russia recognizes and respects the sovereign nation of Ukraine”. After the sign went viral online, the museum reversed course. “We do not for a minute believe that the makers of the Russian mustards on display at the National Mustard Museum should be held responsible for the war in Ukraine,” the museum’s founder, Barry Levenson, told the Guardian. “That is why we are returning them to the public display with a sign asking people to donate to the IRC,” a non-governmental organization that provides humanitarian relief to the refugees. The condiment curator added: “I have tasted so-called Russian-style mustards – sweet and hot. I like them.” Some of history’s most famous Russians have been shunned, despite having been dead for generations. In early March, a university in Milan axed a course on the 19th-century novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky after administrators deemed the writer to be disturbingly Russian. The institution said in a statement that it wanted “to avoid any controversy, in a moment of high tension”. The school backtracked after an uproar, as Dostoevsky defenders pointed out that the author was sentenced to a Siberian prison labor camp for discussing banned books under Russia’s Tsarist regime, and that he has been dead for 141 years. There’s been debate as well over whether we should listen to the work of Pyotr Ilych Tchaikovsky, in particular the composer’s 1812 Overture, written to mark Russia’s defense against Napoleon’s invading forces more than two centuries ago. A performance of the work was canceled by the Cardiff Philharmonic Orchestra. A director there claimed it had “nothing to do with Tchaikovsky being Russian” but “more to do with us deciding that it was inappropriate at the present time”. On Saturday an American space advocacy nonprofit renamed a fundraiser that had been dedicated to Soviet astronaut Yuri Gagarin – the first human to enter outer space, who died during a training flight in 1968. The annual gala, which has been known as “Yuri’s night” for seven years in a row, is now called “A Celebration of Space: Discover What’s Next.” According to a now-deleted note, the organizers explained the change was made “in light of current world events” but “the focus of this fundraising event remains the same.” This month the video game studio Electronic Arts removed the Russian national team from its Fifa video game franchise, “in solidarity with the Ukrainian people”. Even Russian animals are feeling the heat. The American Kennel Club announced that it would ban dog registrations from its Russian counterpart, “in solidarity with the Ukrainian people”. That followed a move earlier this month by the International Cat Federation, the self-described “United Nations of cat federations”, which barred Russian felines from its competitions, saying in a statement that it could not “witness these atrocities and do nothing”. By far the most unhelpful protests have been those directed at ordinary Russian people. In countries including New Zealand, Germany, Canada and the United States, Russian immigrants of all ages have reported being harassed and threatened, on public transit, in stores and at their jobs. Vandals have targeted Russia-themed restaurants and stores in New York and Washington and Russian community centers and churches in Canada, even though all these places publicly oppose the invasion of Ukraine, and in many cases count Ukrainians among their staff. This Russophobia doesn’t exist in isolation. It’s part of a long and ugly pattern of xenophobic, nationalist hatred that flares up during international conflicts and targets people just for appearing “too foreign”. It operates according to the same fearful logic of comparatively sillier acts like pouring out vodka. And it ultimately undermines solidarity rather than creating it. For most of us, the best way to make a tangible difference right now is to donate resources to the victims of war. Examples of worthy organizations include People in Need and the International Rescue Committee, which are on the ground helping Ukrainian residents and refugees (some others are listed here). Ukrainian media need help to keep reporting. And OVD-Info, a legal aid group in Russia, is accepting donations to assist anti-war protesters who have been arrested by Putin’s government.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Dumping vodka, banning Dostoevsky: some anti-Russian protests are empty gestures",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/23/russia-protests-vodka-mustard-poutine
3/23/2022,"Until the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Hungary’s general election campaign was dominated by such ruling party preoccupations as “traditional values” and protecting children from “LGBT propaganda”. Neither Russia nor Ukraine featured in the slogans of Viktor Orbán’s ruling Fidesz party or the opposition parties which have united to dislodge him. But the war, the ensuing refugee exodus and the reshaping of Europe’s geopolitical calculations have dramatically altered the political context ahead of Hungary’s 3 April vote. Warmly received at the Kremlin just three weeks before the invasion, Orbán has had to condemn it, distance himself, at least publicly, from a decade-long friendship with Vladimir Putin and join Hungary’s EU partners in imposing punitive economic sanctions on Russia. Overt hostility to refugees has been a defining issue of Orbán’s rule, but on this too, he has had to fall into line with the EU by granting visa-free admission to those fleeing Russia’s bombs. More than 200,000 Ukrainians have sought refuge in Hungary. The combined opposition now characterise Orbán as Putin’s shameless servant and his ties with Russia as a national security threat. Those ties have been so close that Orbán’s foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, received a Russian Order of Friendshipmedal from Putin’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov as recently as December. “Orbán and Putin or the west and Europe – these are the stakes. A choice between the dark or the good side of history,” Péter Márki-Zay, the joint opposition’s prime ministerial candidate, wrote on social media. Fidesz remains ahead in opinion polls. According to a mid-March poll from Nézőpont, which is close to the ruling party, 49% of voters would choose Fidesz against 41% for the united opposition. However, a survey published on 21 March suggested that Fidesz’s lead had narrowed to just three points with the vote less than a fortnight away. But after 12 years in office Orbán is counting on a counter-narrative on Ukraine to blunt criticism of his Russia policy and return him to power for a fourth consecutive term. Only Fidesz, he claims, can keep Hungarians safe and clear of the conflict next door. Not only is a vote for his party a vote for peace – the government won’t send lethal weapons to Ukraine – but, Fidesz claims, the opposition is on the side of war. “The opposition has lost its mind.” Orbán told supporters at a rally marking Hungarian national day on 15 March. “They would walk into a cruel, protracted, and bloody war and they want to send Hungarian troops and guns to the frontline. We can’t let this happen. Not a single Hungarian can get caught between the Ukrainian anvil and the Russian hammer.” Márki-Zay a centrist conservative, has been smeared by Fidesz political ads, which repeatedly state that he “wants to send Hungarian troops to Ukraine”. Election posters plastered on billboards around Budapest, are almost exclusively those of Fidesz, and most promise to “protect the peace and security of Hungary”, although some have been spray-painted over with the letter Z, to remind voters of Orbán’s close ties to Russia. Orbán’s attempt to avoid taking sides in the conflict is contemptible as far as some younger voters are concerned. Dániel, a 26-year-old systems engineer working in the capital said it brought “shame to this country that Orbán is trying to dance between Russia and Ukraine. The government has done absolutely nothing for the Ukrainians. The help that refugees get here is done by civilians almost entirely.” Nevertheless the dominance of the Fidesz political machine gives it a massive advantage in promoting the “peace and security” narrative, analysts say. “It did not even take Fidesz a week to come up with a new campaign that portrays Orbán as a peacekeeper and an assurance for safety,” said Lakner Zoltán, a political analyst and editor-in-chief of the Jelen news outlet. “Orbán has more resources and a much bigger platform to reach voters.” Fidesz and its allies have effective control of most Hungarian media outlets, including state TV. This grip on the broadcast media along with an online advertising budget that dwarfs the opposition’s reduces other parties’ ability to campaign fairly, they complain. Orbán’s national day address for example, was replayed on the M1 public channel nine times in a 24-hour period. Márki-Zay leads the United for Hungary (Egységben Magyarországért) a coalition of six opposition parties including socialists, social democrats, greens, liberals, and even the former far-right party Jobbik. Orbán’s close ties with Putin ought to have offered them an open goal for slogans such as “Hungary will not become a Russian colony” and “Putin or Europe?” But the broad-spectrum nature of the opposition is also its weakness. Ágoston Mráz, chief executive of Nézőpont, said the war in Ukraine was helping the ruling party more than those promoting a change of government, because “people want to feel secure in a crisis”. András, 31, a taxi driver in the capital, articulated this concern. “You know, I never voted for Orbán, I’m just not a fan of him and Fidesz,” he said. “But I am going to [vote for him] this time. I agree with his policies when it comes to Ukraine. This is not our war. We shouldn’t get involved in all of this.” Péter Krekó, the director of the Budapest-based thinktank Political Capital Institute argues that Orbán’s 12 years fostering a close relationship with Russia has undeniably backfired. The relationship has hardly evaporated since the 24 February invasion either with pro-government media maintaining a seemingly off-message pro-Kremlin tone. Hours into the invasion, a pro-government security commentator Georg Spöttle said on state tv channel, M1, that it was “dangerous” for Volodymyr Zelenskiy to call on Ukrainian citizens to take up arms, and comparable to the actions of Hitler. The government-controlled MTI (Hungary’s state news agency) initially toed the same line required by the Kremlin of Russian media, calling the events in Ukraine a ‘“military operation’” instead of a “war”. Anna Donáth, the chair of the liberal Momentum Mozgalom party concedes that Orbán’s ties with Putin may not damage him reputationally at home. “It’s important to note how effective [Fidesz] propaganda is in Hungary.” Yet, surprises can’t be ruled out. The Hungarian currency, the Forint, already hit by the fallout of the pandemic, has plunged to record lows recently and inflation has risen to 15-year highs. For many Hungarians the economy is of more pressing relevance than foreign policy. Fear of the economic consequences of the war is behind a massive hike in pre-election government spending, Krekósaid. “Everything is just getting worse and worse since Orbán is in power. They are stealing more and more from taxpayers’ money. I am going to be devastated if they win again,” said Gyula, a 67-year-old pensioner in the crowd at an opposition rally last Saturday in Dunakeszi, a city north-west of the capital. The government has capped prices of flour, sunflower oil meat and sugar as well as fuel. But Russia’s war on Ukraine also now threatens one of Orbán’s biggest appeals to voters: cheap gas and heating. With Hungary’s reliance on Russia for 95% of its gas reserves Orbán has ruled out EU sanctions on Russian oil and gas. Whoever prevails on 3 April will inherit a situation unprecedented both in economic and geopolitical terms. Orbán’s campaign slogans include “Hungary is going forward, not back”, a reference to the dismal economic growth record of the pre-Fidesz Socialist-led administration. In some places the opposition have trolled Fidesz’s billboards, replacing “back” with “to Moscow”. In Miskolc, north-east Hungary, Anna, a 56-year-old teacher spoke for the undecideds, thought to make up a quarter of the electorate. She had, she said, “absolutely no idea” who to vote for. “I agree with some of Orbán’s policies, and I voted for him before, but the things he is saying now are the complete opposite of his early promises. But Márki-Zay is also not someone I would like to lead this country. I think we don’t have good options here.”",News/World news,"Orbán casts himself as safe choice as ‘cruel, bloody war’ looms over Hungary’s election",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/orban-casts-himself-as-safe-choice-as-cruel-bloody-war-looms-over-hungarys-election
3/23/2022,"There is a second world war poster showing a red-faced couple looking angrily at their daughter as she adds more fuel to their fire. The caption reads: “Save fuel to make munitions for battle.” It was one of a series of public campaigning posters aimed at driving a collective response to the need to save energy for the war effort. The message was clear: stop using so much fuel, because it is needed for the fighting troops. Today, as Europe and the UK try to pivot away from their dependence on Russian fossil fuels, there is as yet no similar call for collective action from the populace. But Russia gets 40% of its revenue from fossil fuel exports, so any reduction in oil and gas demand will hit Vladimir Putin’s finances. Europe imports 40% of its gas from Russia and 25% of its oil, so any drop in consumption could make a significant impact. The UK is less dependent on Russian fossil fuels; less than 4% of total UK gas supply and 8% of UK oil demand in 2021 was from Russia, according to government figures. But in an interconnected energy world, if Europe cuts imports of Russian oil and gas it will need to source it from elsewhere, contributing to a squeeze on global supplies and global price rises in oil and gas. A recent paper by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change says reducing our oil and gas consumption could be an important tool to help Europe through the medium-term challenge of moving away from Russian energy. There is a need to address energy demand now, according to Prof Nick Eyre, director of the Centre for Research into Energy Demand Solutions at Oxford University, both as a result of the Ukraine crisis and to tackle climate change. Reducing demand and decarbonising our energy systems is something we should be doing anyway for climate reasons, said Eyre, in order to meet our targets for net zero. “This energy security and price crisis is another prompt to do this,” he said. “It will be expensive – but a windfall tax on companies who, at best, have had a pretty dubious relationship with Russia, would help pay for it.” Eyre said collective action was needed, driven by government, who should bring forward immediate detailed policies on decarbonising domestic heating in the UK. Domestic heating produces about 14% of UK emissions, and decarbonising the way homes are heated – meaning more efficient homes and the electrification of most heating systems – would cost an estimated £200bn over the next 30 years, according to the Institute for Government. Between now and 2050, emissions from residential buildings need to fall to zero at a rate of 3.4% a year based on current emission levels, according to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Eyre believes any new energy supply policy – expected to be announced by Boris Johnson in the coming days – will make no sense if it does not include energy reduction measures and the bringing forward of detailed plans to decarbonise our homes. “If it’s all about building nuclear power stations, this would take 10 years, so it’s not a very sensible strategy,” said Eyre. “Energy efficiency and renewable energy can provide what we need more quickly and less dangerously.” Molly Scott Cato, former Green MEP and professor of economics at the University of Roehampton, says the UK government should launch a massive, nationwide, and publicly funded home insulation programme backed up by information campaigns about how to use energy efficiently, including reducing the thermostat settings on central heating systems and introducing a 55mph speed limit on the national road network to cut energy demand. Public information messages could be created as part of this focusing on the dual benefits of helping the war effort against Putin and moving the UK towards meeting its climate targets to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions to reach a target of net zero by 2050. Areas focused on could include where individuals can make changes as part of collective action to reduce energy demand and national policy areas. Turn down the thermostat on your boiler by 1C. If everyone in the UK did this, it would reduce their energy demand by 10%. Energy bills would be cut by £670m, while saving 3.5m tonnes of CO2 a year, according to the Energy Savings Trust. Set your heating to come on only when required. This is estimated to help reduce a household’s electricity use by 2.8% and gas use by 2% (Energy Savings Trust). Set thermostats no higher than 19C and the water temperature in heating systems no higher than 55C, says the Committee on Climate Change. Keep your shower time to four minutes. This could save a typical household 950kWh of energy and 195kg of carbon emissions a year; equivalent to driving 700 miles from Birmingham to Aberdeen and back again (Energy Savings Trust). Turning lights off when leaving a room will save you around 70kWh of energy and 17kg of carbon annually – the equivalent to driving 61 miles from London to Canterbury (Energy Savings Trust). Insulate your home. A fully insulated home is 50% more energy efficient than a property that has no insulation, according to Eyre. Cut domestic energy demand by introducing a four-day week and encouraging more working from home, says the Centre for Research into Energy Demand Solutions. Speed up the replacement of gas boilers with heat pumps. After the failure of the Green Homes Grant, the government will launch its replacement on 1 April 2022. The boiler upgrade scheme will offer a £5,000 grant to replace gas boilers with air-sourced heat pumps. Switching from a typical gas heating system to an air-source heat pump could save about 9,200 kWh a year (Energy Savings Trust). Increase the use of renewables, which are now the cheapest form of energy production on the market. 649 solar and windfarms already have planning permission; if they went ahead they would save more gas than currently imported by the UK from Russia, according to Carbon Brief. Replace fossil-fuelled cars with electric ones. A fully electric vehicle could save 2 tonnes of CO2 a year and help end dependence on fossil fuel (CCC).",News/Environment,Could a behavioural change campaign save energy and cut Russian gas imports?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/23/could-a-behavioural-change-campaign-save-energy-and-cut-russian-gas-imports
3/23/2022,"Climbing the inside of Christina Sporrong’s gigantic head, I look up towards the books that are escaping through the top of its open skull and fluttering out into the perfect blue sky. I have to watch my step – there are some gaps in the railings – until I reach the eye socket and get to peek out at my surroundings. Back in 2019, when Sporrong’s Flybrary sculpture was first unveiled, this would have given me the chance to take in Nevada’s famous desert festival Burning Man. I could have watched naked hippies and spaced-out ravers dancing amid colourful sculptures and bursts of pyrotechnics. Today, however, I’m getting a rather different view: the glorious park estate of Chatsworth House in Derbyshire. It’s here that Radical Horizons: The Art of Burning Man will open next month: a free exhibition of 12 sculptures created by artists from the festival, dotted all around the grounds. From my vantage point inside the head, all is quiet. In the distance, a dog-walker is crossing Paine’s Bridge. Nearby a couple of bemused pensioners are taking photos. I sense they may be asking themselves why a giant, non-binary head has suddenly landed on the lawn of one of the country’s most beloved stately homes. The same question could be asked about quite a lot of what’s here: steel wings 28ft tall that invite you to stretch out inside them; cuddly bears made from US pennies; a trio of metal moths named Jayne, Luna and Gonzo. Perhaps most eye-opening of all, a huge mechanical winged horse that will gallop and breathe fire right beside the house itself. Isn’t this all rather wild for Chatsworth? “No, I thought it was wonderful!” says Peregrine Cavendish, the 12th Duke of Devonshire, from inside his lower library. He explains how this unlikely collaboration between a festival of self-expression in the US and an ancient estate in the Derbyshire Dales came to be. The auction house Sotheby’s put them in touch, predicting they had more in common than one might think. One is an open mind. The duke may look and speak like a duke but he has a subversive streak. Opening alongside Radical Horizons is an exhibition called Living With Art We Love, in which Chatsworth House will be decorated with the duke and duchess’s private collection of modern art: some more in keeping with the style of the house (a corridor of Lucian Freud’s portraits) than others (a series of retina-shredding Michael Craig-Martin prints). “I’m a bit nervous to be honest,” says the duke. “It’s a bit like exposing yourself.” Time for a tour of the sculptures. We start with Wings of Glory, the silver pegasus that is having its first wing lowered on to it as we arrive. “This bit never goes smoothly,” says creator Adrian Landon, kitted out in a hi-vis jacket, as they try to screw down the bolts. I catch a glimpse of its inner workings: a riot of old cogs and chains that apparently consists of a 1980s golf cart and a BMW rear differential. But I also sense its majesty. This winged beauty could almost have been standing guard here by the house for hundreds of years. Landon first went to Burning Man in 2018 and was instantly inspired, creating Wings of Glory for the following year. “As an artist, you rarely have such clear moments of inspiration,” he says, recalling the reaction it got when it arrived: “There was this sea of people completely transfixed by it. People were coming up to me in tears, thanking me for it.” Bringing it to Chatsworth has proved challenging: the horse had to be dismantled and packed into a 40ft shipping container along with all the correct tools and spare parts. As Landon tells me this, a ladder comes crashing down on the newly-attached wing. He grimaces. I let him get back to work. The Flybrary has been placed near the banks of the Derwent, its head turned away from the house so that people have to venture out to get the best view of it, which is from across the bridge – although Sporrong says she tilted it slightly so that the duke and duchess could still see part of the face from their window (unlike many stately homes, Chatsworth is still used as a residence). She says the idea for Flybrary came to her in a dream: the head of a future human, ambiguous in race and gender, who could still think and dream no matter how bad the oppression from the Trump era might get. When she debuted the piece at Burning Man, she had the added idea of turning it into a library. It was filled with 600 books that people could check out during the week. “We also worked with the Human Library from Denmark,” says Sporrong. “So you could ‘check out’ a person and learn from them.” One was the father of a victim of a school shooting. “He would talk about his experience, what he learned and how he overcame it. It was profound and lovely.” Sporrong always assumed her head would end up outside a public library in a big city. Bringing it to the heart of the British aristocracy required a bit of a mental leap. “I’m curious as to what the reaction will be,” she says, a little tentatively. We hop in the car of Kim Cook, director of creative initiatives at Burning Man, to visit some of the further flung works. We drive past the spot where Lodestar, the biggest piece, will go: a second world war military jet now boasting hand-blown glass flowers as blossom. At present, only half of the top has arrived and that’s caused problems enough: too heavy to be driven over the bridge, which has a 28-ton limit, it had to come via an alternative entrance that involved squeezing it through the house’s gold leaf gates (it made it by a centimetre or two). Next we pass a pile of stones arranged neatly next to each other. This is the half-finished work of Benjamin Langholz, whose free-spirited life (“trekking in Nepal, dancing in Israel, learning rope bondage in Japan”) was also altered forever by a 2016 visit to Burning Man, during which he helped build – and burn – two wooden pyramids called Catacomb of Veils. The following year he brought his shibari rope bondage teacher and a crew of Japanese people to the festival to make a piece using 11 miles of rope. More recently he created Stone 27 for the festival, a stunning walkable pathway of 600lb stones suspended in mid-air. He is reimagining that work as Stone 40 for Chatsworth, a spiral circle that, as with the other sculptures, is very much there to be touched and clambered upon. Langholz will use locally quarried stone, like that which Chatsworth itself was built from, and it’s these connections that make Cook especially passionate about the project. “It’s easy to say, ‘Burning Man, naked people! Chatsworth, old England’,” she says. “But then you lose these layers of connection.” Cook adds: “There are a number of people, including the duke and duchess, who can see the future here and want to pull forward. But at the same time, all of us hold a responsibility for the tender hearts of those who might be a bit like, ‘What’s happening here?’” Everything needs to work in harmony. Not least because four sculptures are set to be made on site during the exhibition over the summer, all engaging with local people and materials. Dana Albany is making a mermaid with local children using steel from a playground that had to be pulled down. Rebekah Waites is creating a piece called Relevé, inspired by the Nine Ladies Stone Circle, a bronze age archeological site that’s near the house. According to local lore, this circle was created when nine women were caught dancing on the sabbath and turned into stone as punishment. Waites’s tribute to it will be made from some sweet chestnut trees that had to be felled because they were diseased. Relevé will be set ablaze on the celebratory final night of the installations, in true Burning Man style: another bold move for Chatsworth. I wonder how the duke will feel about the whole thing once that final work has gone up in flames? Will he become a convert, perhaps even tempted to attend the next Burning Man himself? “I would love to see it,” he says. “But I have to admit I’m not too keen on camping.” Perhaps he could invite the festival-goers over here instead for a free house and garden party. Could that be Chatsworth’s next move? “I think that’s very unlikely,” he says. “But we do love doing new things. We should never rule anything out!”  Radical Horizons: The Art of Burning Man is at Chatsworth House, from 9 April to 1 October 2022. Living With Art We Love, an exhibition presented by the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire, is at Chatsworth from 26 March to 9 October.

3/23/2022,"When John Adams and his two daughters settled down to watch a family film, he wasn’t expecting questions about bombing raids. But as they discussed what to watch, he spotted 12-year-old Helen scrolling through YouTube, looking for clips of air-raid sirens. She wanted to know what it would sound like, if the worst came to the worst. “The question this morning at breakfast was: ‘What are we meant to do if there’s a nuclear attack?’” says Adams, a stay-at-home dad from Caterham in Surrey, who runs the parenting blog DadBlogUK. “That one just took me right back to my childhood, when these were real practical questions and everyone knew that you were meant to get under a table or a flight of stairs.” He still remembers deciding that in the event of war, he would climb some high ground near his house to watch for incoming missiles. Now, he’s the one digging out maps to show nine-year-old Izzy where Ukraine is. The family has distant relatives in the country, who have now escaped to Hungary, which he thinks has made the war “that bit more real” for them. Over tea or on the school run, and in those raw moments just before lights out, when children often disclose what’s actually troubling them, many parents now face questions they’re struggling to answer. A primary school teacher friend spent last week soothing pupils who were panicking that a bomb was about to drop on them; another father I know was floored by questions about whether he would be called up in the event of a world war. While British children’s anxieties pale in comparison with what their Ukrainian peers are suffering under bombardment from Russian rockets, a pandemic that led to rising mental health problems among young people has left many parents wondering about the impact of living through seemingly apocalyptic times. Books on helping children manage their emotions, from the TV presenter Ant Middleton’s Mission Total Resilience, to Tom and Joe Brassington’s picture book Bottled, are shooting up Amazon rankings. On Mumsnet, a mother questioning whether her daughter’s year 3 teachers should have talked to the class about Ukrainians “having to leave the country with their pets for fear of being shot by Russians”, triggered a lengthy debate (the consensus was that it was already the talk of the playground). School-gate chat revolves around whether to turn off the radio, and how to reassure children still reeling from lockdown that life isn’t about to turn upside down again. “I’m a firm believer in lying to the children,” says Liz, a writer and parent of three children aged 12, 14 and 16. “We told them we’d all be fine and not to worry during Covid, which we all were. If something terrible does happen, I’ll deal with it as and when. While it’s all speculation, I am not putting that on them.” But Julia, a mother of three teenagers aged 19, 17 and 14, regrets reassuring them when the virus first emerged in China that it was nothing to worry about; within weeks the boys were in lockdown, and their grandmother had died in a nursing home. “I learned then never to reassure when I couldn’t be sure. But I worry that after two years of pandemic stuff, we’re straight into even more scary stuff. It’s hard being a parent right now.” Dr Jane Gilmour, a consultant clinical psychologist and author of the book How to Have Incredible Conversations with Your Child, recommends honesty. “If you say something that’s not true to your child it may harm their sense of trust, and when we’re in this period of time when things are feeling unstable then keeping a sense of stability is exactly what they need.” But being honest, she stresses, doesn’t mean telling them everything you might know. For a young child, for example, you could use an analogy from everyday life to explain why war has broken out. “For example, if somebody takes something that doesn’t belong to them, that’s not OK. Your description need not be lengthy.” On questions parents themselves struggle with, such as whether this is the beginning of world war 3, she suggests not getting drawn into detail. “I’d stick to general statements: ‘Yes, this is a concerning issue, but the countries are working together to figure out what to do.’ Note that day-to-day life in the UK is going to be the same as it ever was.” She also recommends parents establish what children have already heard and pitch things accordingly. “My first question would be: ‘What do you want to know?’ not: ‘What are you worried about?’ Older children might be interested in facts, like what does a sanction mean. Other children might want to know about safety, like: ‘Am I going to be OK?’” With younger children, you could watch BBC Newsround together; if teenagers mention something they have seen on social media, don’t scoff but suggest looking at it with them. “It might be accurate, but it’s important to give them the skills of critical evaluation. If you tut and say: ‘Don’t bring me stuff you’ve seen on social media,’ you’ve lost your chance.” And with anxiety-prone children, Gilmour says it’s all in your delivery. “The way you act, the tone of your voice, the speed that you talk at – all of these pieces of information help children figure out how they should feel about the world. If parents appear calm, then their children are more likely to feel calm.” Getting children to identify their emotions, or describing their emotions back to them (“I think you’re feeling anxious …”) can help them feel more in control. For children spiralling from one what-if scenario to the next, she suggests encouraging them to write down or record their worries through the day and then set a daily check-in time to discuss them; help them recognise which fears have faded since writing them down, which are big and which are relatively small. “Worries are very often intense in the moment but disappear with time.” Parents can also explain that while the news may seem bleak, life won’t always be like this, and that some, such as the psychologist Stephen Pinker in his book Better Angels of Our Nature, argue that the overall trend of human progress is away from violence. Some families, however, are struggling with more complicated questions. Natasha emigrated from Russia to Britain two decades ago, and while her two sons were born here, her parents are still in Moscow. She has been showing her 14-year-old pictures of anti-war protests in Russia, explaining that many ordinary Russians abhor the invasion, while others support it only because they are fed propaganda. “I had this chat to just help him with what to some degree we all have – this internal dilemma, something awful has been done, and it’s not in our names,” says Natasha, who spent much of the last week in tears. Her 19-year-old, a fluent Russian speaker, is grappling with similar questions of identity. “He was getting into some scraps online even before this, when people were saying anti-Russian things, and I’ve had to have conversations with him, asking him to tone it right down. I’ve had to explain that it potentially might have consequences for him.” The boys haven’t seen their grandparents for three years due to Covid, and Natasha is worried about the impact of sanctions imposed for a war her parents don’t support. “I’m worrying whether my mum’s cancer drugs are going to be available in a couple of months, because they’re expensive. Two weeks ago, I could PayPal them some money, but I can’t any more because of sanctions. Their savings are halved in value because they’re in roubles and prices are going super-crazy for everyday stuff.” As the editor-in-chief of a national news magazine, Anna Bassi regularly finds herself tackling distressing subjects. What makes that trickier is that the Week Junior’s readers are all children, aged eight to 14. In one issue this month, she devoted five pages to Ukraine, covering everything from how economic sanctions work to pictures of refugees being welcomed in Poland, along with posters to colour in. Following careful consultation with parents and teachers about what fears children are expressing, it also tackled Vladimir Putin’s threat to put nuclear weapons in a higher state of readiness. “One mother told us that her son had said: ‘I’ve heard that Russia has weapons that will melt your skin and kill us all.’ Some of it is absolutely heartbreaking,” says Bassi. So the magazine explained that Putin was trying to send a message to the west, but that didn’t mean nuclear weapons were going to be used, and that adults were working to stop that happening. It also highlighted ways children could help, such as fundraising for refugees or writing to their MP. But Bassi stresses that whether she’s covering war or climate change – the magazine avoids the phrase “climate crisis”, judging that it can heighten anxiety for kids – there’s a delicate balance between giving children constructive things to do and overloading them with responsibility. “There’s a lot of talk about this amazing generation of children who care so much and are going to save the planet and I strongly feel that the burden shouldn’t all be on their shoulders. It’s really important to demonstrate that there are adults whose job is to prevent climate change too.” Like Adams, Bassi grew up in the 80s under the threat of nuclear war, and doesn’t think the world is necessarily a scarier place now than it was then. The difference, she argues, is that “children are exposed to more of it because of social media”. With her own children, 12 and 16, her priority is putting what they have heard elsewhere in context. “I think there’s a real danger of allowing them to build a picture of world events on overheard snippets of information.” The magazine’s formula is to provide facts, explain the context, but then move quickly on to what’s being done to help. It’s an approach Michael and his partner have used with their two sons, who they adopted aged three and one, just before the first Covid lockdown. Adoption involves discussing difficult emotions openly, he points out, which was unexpectedly good training for talking about a deadly virus followed by a war. They have explained it as a bully country attacking a smaller one. “I still don’t really know what language to use, except to think back to the TV they like: superheroes and rescue missions. So we talk about rockets flying through the skies and buildings on fire, and then focus on the rescue efforts of Ukrainians to ‘save the day’ and get people safely out,” he says. “It’s our job to make them feel safe in their new home, but they’re entitled to know that the world isn’t always a safe place. Sadly, they experienced that themselves in their previous life.” What the past two years have brought home to many parents is the sobering realisation that we can’t protect children from everything. There was no hiding the pandemic from toddlers once playgrounds were locked and they couldn’t see their grandparents. It’s hard to shield teenagers from a war when TikTok is full of video footage from Kyiv. Gilmour points out that living through uncertain times can help children acquire the tools to deal with shocks in adult life. “One of the things we have got to develop as parents is ways of managing uncertainty,” she says. “I’m not saying this is an easy period in family life. But it’s an opportunity for families to say: ‘This is a concerning time, but we’re going to keep calm and carry on.’” Even if, sometimes, we’re doing so with fingers crossed. Some names have been changed.

3/23/2022,"The lines for sugar in Saratov were hard not to compare to the Soviet era, part of a recent run on Russian staples that have revived fears that the Kremlin’s invasion in Ukraine will lead to a virtual slide back to the shortages or endless queues of the Soviet Union. Bags of sugar and buckwheat began disappearing from local markets in early March, just a week after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. And when the local mayor’s office announced that it would hold special markets for people to buy the staples last week, hundreds showed up. “People are sharing tips about where to get sugar. This is crazy,” said Viktor Nazarov, who said that his grandmother had tasked him with visiting the special market last weekend to stock up. “It’s sad and it’s funny. It feels like a month ago was fine and now we’re talking about the 1990s again, buying products because … we’re afraid they’ll disappear.” After an hour and a half waiting at the city’s main square, he was limited to buying one bag of five kilograms, he said. Other videos shared on social media have shown fights for sugar in markets in other cities in Russia, all while officials have maintained that the shortage is part of an artificial crisis. “What is happening with sugar today is aimed at creating a panic mood in society,” said the governor of Russia’s Omsk region, which is facing similar shortages, on Tuesday. The sudden shortages are a first taste of what is going to be a hard year for Russia, marked by a massive economic contraction, high inflation and an unprecedented cutoff from the world for a globalised economy. “I think we are steadily going back to a USSR,” said Elina Ribakova, deputy chief economist for the Institute of International Finance, indicating that the Russian government would likely continue to close off from the world economy. “I’m not seeing it as a temporary shock and then we’re going to go back to the liberal democracy and reintegration into the world, unless there is a change in government.” As Russian troops pressed forward in Ukraine, stores in some big cities have reported shortages of essential products such as tampons. Prices on imported goods, such as Tide detergent, clothing, or toothpastes, have also skyrocketed as the rouble tumbled in value. For the rise in price on basic goods, the government has blamed panic buying and speculators, saying it has more than enough supply to satisfy demand. “As in 2020, I want to reassure our citizens now: we fully provide ourselves with sugar and buckwheat. There is no need to panic and buy up these goods – there are enough of them for everyone,” said Viktoria Abramchenko, a Russian deputy prime minister, in a public address. More worryingly, medicines such as insulin have begun disappearing from pharmacy shelves. Some polls have indicated that Russian doctors are facing shortages of more than 80 medicines at pharmacies, including insulin and a popular children’s anti-inflammation medicine. Once again Russian officials blamed panic buyers, noting that most western pharmaceutical companies have said that they will not limit shipments of essential medicines to Russia. But as Russia’s economy contracts, inflation is expected to skyrocket as high as 20% this year, said Ribakova. For ordinary Russians, she said, that would mean “poverty. Poverty and desperation.” “People were so busy with just surviving,” she said. “Getting basic drugs, basic foods, surviving on minimal pensions … people are coming very skinny to this crisis. They don’t have savings, they were barely surviving before, and now they’ll be spending days in queues and lacking access to basic healthcare and drugs.” Natalia Zubarevich, an expert on the economy of Russia’s regions, noted that the main reason for the recent shortages was not just the damage from sanctions but also the failure of supply chains and hesitancy to make big purchases while the value of the rouble remains so volatile. “I understand that the instincts of the Soviet-Russian people don’t change,” she said during a recent radio show, noting how sugar was a traditional item to purchase during unsure economic times. “But I’d think like this: If you have a beloved pet, think about where the pet food is made and from what … I was berating myself because I bought too little [medical pet food]. This isn’t sugar. I should have bought more.” Thousands of employees have been affected as large foreign companies including Ikea and McDonald’s have temporarily exited the market. Meanwhile, local factories and other employers have also begun halting production. Earlier this month, AvtoVAZ, one of the country’s largest automakers, had been forced to halt production of certain lines of vehicles earlier this month. And Moscow’s Sheremetyevo, the country’s largest airport, said on Monday that it would have to furlough a fifth of its staff and halt further hiring as passenger traffic slows due to sanctions. In the longer term, entire sectors of the Russian economy could be at risk, as the lack of access to western component parts could affect everything from air travel to production of consumer goods. “Economic growth is sacrificed for the sake of this wartime economy,” said Maria Shagina of the Finnish Institute of International Affairs and the Geneva International Sanctions Network. The additional risks and volatility of operating in Russia now mean that many companies will decide not to reenter the market, she said. And the recent exodus of the youngest and the brightest of the country makes it unclear who will step in to prepare alternatives. “It is possible that a couple of years down the road that there will be Russian alternatives for products from Microsoft to tampons but it will take time to produce,” said Ribakova. “And the question is who will produce that.”",News/World news,‘We’re going back to a USSR’: long queues return for Russian shoppers as sanctions bite,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/were-going-back-to-a-ussr-long-queues-return-for-russian-shoppers-as-sanctions-bite
3/23/2022,"The US’s most powerful pro-Israel lobby group has been accused of putting support for Israel before American democracy after it declared its backing for the election campaigns of three dozen Republican members of Congress who tried to block President Biden’s presidential victory. But the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) has defended the move by saying that support for the Jewish state overrides other issues and that it is “no moment for the pro-Israel movement to become selective about its friends”. In December, Aipac launched a political action committee that enables it for the first time to spend money directly supporting congressional candidates in this year’s midterm elections. Earlier this month the committee released a list of 120 political endorsements that includes 37 Republicans who voted against certifying Biden’s victory following the January 6 2021 storming of the Capitol. Among them are two members of Congress, Jim Jordan and Scott Perry, who plotted with Trump’s White House to overturn the election result. Perry has also publicly promoted racist “white replacement” conspiracy theories. The lobby group’s move has been met by a storm of criticism, including from other pro-Israel organizations. “Aipac’s support for these candidates endangers American democracy and undermines the true interests and values of millions of American Jews and pro-Israel Americans who they often claim to represent,” said the more moderate but less influential pro-Israel lobby group, J Street. “Whatever their views on Israel, elected officials who threaten the very future of our country should be completely beyond the pale.” Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, described the endorsement of politicians who “undermine democracy” as “morally bankrupt and short-sighted”. “What ties the 2 countries is a commitment to democracy. An undemocratic America could easily distance itself from the Jewish state,” he tweeted. The former head of the strongly pro-Israel Anti-Defamation League, Abe Foxman, described the endorsements as a “sad mistake”. The former US ambassador to Israel, Dan Kurtzer, called on Aipac to reconsider the move and “do the right thing for America”. Halie Soifer, CEO of the Jewish Democratic Council of America and a former national security adviser to then Senator Kamala Harris, said that Aipac’s endorsements suggest that, at times, “one must compromise support of America’s democracy to support Israel”. “This is a patently false dichotomy rejected by the overwhelming majority of American Jews,” she wrote in the Israeli newspaper, Haaretz. In the face of the growing criticism, Aipac’s leaders last week sent a letter to the group’s members defending the endorsements. “This is no moment for the pro-Israel movement to become selective about its friends,” said the letter, obtained by the Jewish Insider. “The one thing that guarantees Israel’s ability to defend itself is the enduring support of the United States. When we launched our political action committee last year, we decided that we would base decisions about political contributions on only one thing: whether a political candidate supports the US-Israel relationship.” Aipac broke with more than 70 years of standing back from individual political campaigns to launch the political action committee (Pac) that permits it to directly fund favoured candidates within limits. It also founded a second so-called “super Pac” that allows unlimited funding for advertising in support of campaigns but not direct donations. The super Pac is reported to have raised $10m already, including $8.5m from Aipac itself. The list of endorsements includes Democrats with a record of strong backing for Israel at a time when opinion polls show declining support among the party’s voters. A poll last year found found that half of Democrats want Washington to shift policy toward more support for the Palestinians. Although Aipac presents itself as bipartisan, that position has been increasingly tested. It openly opposed President Obama’s demand that Israel freeze expansion of settlements in the occupied territories, widely considered illegal under international law. The group also lobbied Congress on behalf of Israel against Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran. In his memoir, A Promised Land, Obama wrote that “members of both parties worried about crossing” Aipac. “Those who criticized Israeli policy too loudly risked being tagged as ‘anti-Israel’ (and possibly antisemitic) and confronted with a well-funded opponent in the next election,” he wrote. Aipac’s move also comes amid stiffening criticism of Israel from human rights groups, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, which have both recently accused the country of maintaining a form of apartheid over the Palestinians. The head of Amnesty International’s US office, Paul O’Brien, recently said that when the organisation met with members of congress to discuss its new report, Israel’s Apartheid Against Palestinians, it found that Aipac had got there first. “It was an interesting experience for us to introduce a report that was about to be launched in public a week later and to get in 80 different congressional offices a public statement dissociating themselves from the findings of the report in which none of those 80 statements actually disputed the findings of the report, except to say, in broad strokes, we do not believe that this report is motivated for the right reasons or reaches the right conclusions,” he said.",News/US news,‘Morally bankrupt’: outrage after pro-Israel group backs insurrectionist Republicans,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/23/aipac-pro-israel-group-backs-insurrectionist-republicans
3/23/2022,"Praise for Ash Barty’s actions on and off the court has flooded social media since news of the world No 1’s shock retirement broke. Coming less than a year after her Wimbledon win and less than two months after she became the first local Australian Open winner in 44 years, the 25-year-old’s announcement came as a huge surprise. Barty’s long-time mentor, Evonne Goolagong Cawley, said she was excited to see what she did next. “I’m so supportive of Ash and making a decision that is the best for her and makes her happy,” the retired champion said. “I can’t wait to see what the next chapter brings and to watch Ash achieve her dreams.” Australian of the Year and wheelchair tennis legend Dylan Alcott was among the many to pay tribute to Barty as a champion on and off the court. Ash Barty. Amazing tennis player but even better person. A champion in every sense of the word. Very proud of you mate ❤️ Her rivals on the court also noted her popularity off it. American tennis player Madison Keys congratulated “an incredible tennis player but more importantly one of the nicest people on tour”. Former world No 1 Simona Halep said she would miss her friend on the tour. Ash, what can I say, you know I have tears right? My friend, I will miss you on tour. You were different, and special, and we shared some amazing moments. What's next for you? Grand Slam champion in golf?! Be happy and enjoy your life to the max xo Simo@ashbarty pic.twitter.com/WbX7kXnJ1l Former Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova said Barty had shown “true class leaving tennis in this beautiful way”. Ash, I have no words... actually you are showing your true class leaving tennis in this beautiful way.I am so happy I could share the court with you.. tennis will never be the same without you! I admire you as a player and a person.. wishing you only the best! ❤️@ashbarty As another Wimbledon champion, Andy Murray, said, it’s a huge loss for the game. Happy for @ashbarty gutted for tennis 🎾 what a player❤️ Many Indigenous Australians took to social media to express what Barty’s career meant to her community. Scott Morrison, the prime minister of Australia, called Barty to personally thank her for her contribution to the country. At a press conference he said she had inspired “a generation of young people, and particularly a generation of young Indigenous people in this country”. Other Australian politicians also applauded her impact. An inspiration, a magician on the court, a champion of Wimbledon and the Australian Open – World Number One.As you climbed to the very top, you lifted us all.Congratulations to Ash Barty on a magnificent career. 🇦🇺🎾 pic.twitter.com/Us2B3Z5Ob0 The Women’s Tennis Association thanked Barty for “the incredible mark you’ve left on-court, off-court and in our hearts” while Tennis Australia congratulated the “world No 1 role model”. Barty told long-time friend and former tennis player Casey Dellacqua in the announcement made on Instagram that she has other dreams to chase. Her loss from Australia’s sporting landscape will be felt beyond the tennis world. Former Australian netballer Nat Medhurst expressed mixed emotions, saying she was feeling “torn between being completely gutted that she’s retiring or being so happy for her in reaching this decision & everything that she has achieved. Either way – what a bloody legend.” Bec Goddard, an Australian rules football coach, believes Margaret Court Arena should be renamed for Barty as a better representative of contemporary Australian values.

3/23/2022,"Wednesday’s bombshell was not the first time Barty has called time on her tennis career – she did likewise after the US Open in 2014, saying the rigours of the professional tour meant she had missed out on the kind of life a normal teenager enjoys. So Barty went and did what any normal teenager would do – play professional cricket. But after just one impressive season with the Brisbane Heat in the WBBL, Barty decided to return to tennis in 2016, even though at the time she wasn’t sure if her decision would pay off. “I was very young, but I turn 20 this year and it’s a different perspective on life and tennis in general,” she told the WTA website at the time. “If it works, great. If it doesn’t, I can’t really complain. I’ve had a phenomenal career for the short time that I did play.” It did work out for Barty, who returned to the court under the tutelage of coach Craig Tyzzer, initially in doubles before embarking on what would be a remarkable rise up the singles rankings. By the end of 2017, she was ranked inside the Top 20 and a year later the Top 15. WTA titles were pocketed but her major breakthrough came at Roland Garros in June 2019 when she claimed the first of what would be her three grand slam titles, following in the footsteps of compatriot Margaret Court 46 years previously and becoming the first Australian to win a grand slam singles title since Sam Stosur at the 2014 US Open. Another Australian, Pat Cash, summed up Barty’s meteoric rise after her 6-1, 6-3 win over Czech teenager Markéta Vondroušová in the French Open final. “Where she has come in the last year is just incredible. She was a decent player and a very good doubles player – and the next thing you know, she’s a grand slam champion.” As the freshly minted French Open champion, Barty rose to No 2 in the world before she reached the pinnacle of women’s tennis for the first time with victory in her next tournament, the Birmingham Classic. It was a lofty position she would get used to. Despite briefly losing the top spot to Naomi Osaka, she regained it and did not relinquish it again. In total, Barty spent 121 weeks on top of the world and became just the fifth woman to finish the year as No 1 for three consecutive years. Last year was a big year for Barty. After an 11-month hiatus due to the impact of Covid-19 on international travel, the Queenslander – still ranked No 1 – returned with a bang as she continued to enjoy success on the tour, picking up three titles, including the 2021 Miami Open. By June, she had claimed the biggest of them all and lived out a dream on the grass courts on SW19 by winning her second grand slam title. She did so against Karolína Plíšková after a tense final to become the first Australian woman to win Wimbledon since her mentor and idol Evonne Goolagong Cawley in 1980. That Barty chose to wear a scallop-patterned dress inspired by her cultural roots and links with fellow proud Indigenous woman Goolagong Cawley made her achievement and the moment even more special. Success at her home slam had eluded Barty until this year when she staged a fairytale run to the final at Melbourne Park. In front of an adoring public, her dominance was total – she did not drop a single set and lost just one service game on her way to the championship decider against Danielle Collins, who she then dispatched in straight sets to end a 44-year wait for an Australian woman to lift the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup. Everyone from Rod Laver to Cathy Freeman, Russell Crowe to Chris O’Neil was present to witness her ascension to Australian sporting greatness, although it was Goolagong Cawley who stole the show when she surprised Barty by appearing on court to hand her the Australian Open trophy. Sometimes it’s difficult to tell if Barty is actually a singular entity, such is her insistence on including her wider team in any individual praise aimed her way. Rarely does she refer to herself as “I” – rather it’s “we”, an acknowledgment of the unseen efforts of those around her and reflective of her opinion that tennis, despite appearing to be a very individual sport, is a team game. It is a small verbal tick that speaks a great deal about Barty the person. Despite her enormous success, her humility became a shining trait during her career – and an inspiration to many across the globe. Take this year’s Australian Open, and her words about the great Rod Laver, as one of numerous examples. “He was unbeatable. I’m certainly not. I’m just out here doing what I can, enjoying it.” Or when she reached the top of the rankings for the first time, emulating Goolagong Cawley: “I’m nowhere near her status. To be mentioned in the same sentence is incredible.”",Sport/Sport,Ash Barty’s greatest hits: the moments that defined retired tennis star’s career,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/23/ash-bartys-greatest-hits-the-moments-that-defined-retired-tennis-stars-career

3/23/2022,"“Can you see it?” I say. “Up there. A skylark.” “Yes,” says my daughter, not seeing it. It’s bright and blustery up on the moor edge, on the south bank of the great slug of upland that divides the dales of the Aire and the Wharfe. Cruising raptors seem almost to pitch themselves off the edge of Eldwick Crag into the deeper air of the valley: a kite, a buzzard, a kestrel pair. As we climb the path, the skylarks pop up, song-powered, spring-propelled, from the farmland on our right. Where they cross a cloud they’re easy to see; then you lose them in the blue. They’ll be nesting soon (the skylark, Shelley’s “scorner of the ground”, in fact, lays its eggs there, in loose, low vegetation). They will share their breeding quarters here with lapwings, which are making a start right about now. We watch a few of them putting on an airshow of twisting display flight – black-bolero wings working madly, shrieks of glee a stone’s throw from hysteria. Lapwings always seem to be having fun. An old legend, though, tells otherwise: it says that each lapwing embodies the damned soul of someone who jeered Jesus at his crucifixion, transformed and banished to the wild places (“filling the air with their eternal wail”, wrote WR Calvert in his 1937 novel Wild Life on Moor and Fell). I’m not buying it. Weeoop, say the lapwings. Peeeooo! I pick up my daughter. “Can you see them?” “Yes.” She’s holding her binoculars backwards. The lapwings, if not cursed, may yet be ill-fated. They are red-listed now – the highest level of conservation concern. UK populations have crashed with the rise of spring cropping and intensified pasture management. Lapwings have been here before, in the 19th century, when farmland restructuring and a rise in “egging” for food led to a population crash; that time, eventually, they came back. A little later, by the canal, we hear our first chiffchaff of the year. The trees are still leafless; he’s not hard to pick out. “Can you see him? In the treetop there?” “Yes.” I’ll take her word for it.

3/23/2022,"Aquatic-safety advocate Angela Beale-Tawfeeq grew up swimming at the public pool in her predominantly Black neighborhood. “We always say, ‘In North Philadelphia, born and raised, in the swimming pool is where we spent most of our days,’ she recites, referencing the familiar lyrics of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air theme song. Now the education and research director of Diversity in Aquatics (one of the nation’s only organizations of Black and brown aquatics professionals), Beale-Tawfeeq is one of the many compelling voices contributing to Pool: A Social History of Segregation, a new wide-ranging exhibition about the United States’s history of segregated swimming and its connection to today’s alarming drowning rates in Black communities. Encompassing history, artworks and storytelling across a broad array of media, the immersive presentation uses public swimming pools as a lens through which to ponder social justice and public health. The ​​4,700-sq-ft exhibition is now on view at Philadelphia’s historic Fairmount Water Works, a neo-classical landmark abutting the Schuylkill River that pumped water into the city until the turn of the 20th century and later became an aquarium and then one of the city’s first integrated pools, backed by the father of the actor Grace Kelly. After decades of preservation efforts, most of the building reopened in 2003 as an environmental education center, but the three-lane cement pool area was never restored due to lack of funding, according to Victoria Prizzia, the exhibition organizer. “It felt very important to have that sacred space – a historic site and former public pool that had been neglected and captured in a state of arrested decay,” says Prizzia, a former lifeguard and competitive swimmer who since 2009 has directed many projects about water issues and the environment. “When you step inside, you really are transported. This is a reclaiming of that space, to tell the story in a different way.” The exhibition’s projections bring the walls of the space to life. Near the entrance lies a digital pool of water that visitors are encouraged to sit around and virtually dip their feet into while listening to interview excerpts from athletes, activists and academics. “I love when you have the architectural elements speak for themselves, and in this case they really become another character,” Prizzia notes. (And this character has seen its share of floods due to its riverbank location: the exhibition was all set to open in September, but Hurricane Ida swept through mere hours after the opening reception; the space flooded, but miraculously nothing was damaged.) Public pools have long been contested sites that reflect America’s racial and economic divisions, since the 1920s when pools began to be segregated by race instead of, as previously, by sex or class. A deep anxiety emerged around that time about people of different races and sexes sharing such intimate spaces. In the south, segregation was mandated through city ordinances and other official exclusionary rules; in northern states, de facto segregation occurred as a result of building public pools in white neighborhoods or, more frequently, through intimidation, harassment and violence. A digital animation commission by the noted Philadelphia playwright James Ijames titled Moving Portraits interweaves the history of segregated swimming with the achievements of Black swimming heroes. Cast on to the Water Works’ historic facade opposite custom stadium seating evoking the golden era of public pools, it’s a highlight of the exhibition, according to Prizzia: “We’re not only showing tragedy but also revealing this other current – the accomplishments that have been forgotten, happening in parallel, by Black swimmers.” Also largely overlooked is the fact that many non-European peoples were proficient swimmers until the late 1800s, at which point a nascent white beach and pool culture drove people of color away from those spaces. In Pool, this essential and little-known historical context comes via archival images and narratives from Kevin Dawson, author of the 2018 book Undercurrents of Power: Aquatic Culture in the African Diaspora. “The exhibit is really important in that it’s helping to encourage Black people to get back into the water,” Dawson tells the Guardian. “Many are seeing swimming as kind of their historical heritage that Jim Crow racism denied them.” The legacy of that shameful history, compounded by the slashing of funds for public pools, is evident in today’s grim drowning disparities: in Pennsylvania, Black children have a 50% higher rate of accidental drowning than white children. Nationwide, Black youth are almost six times more likely than white children to drown in a swimming pool, and 69% of Black children have little to no swimming ability, compared with 42% of white children. “The story of water is really a story of social justice,” says Prizzia, pointing to inequities in land use, infrastructure and pollution in addition to access to swimming spaces. Philadelphia has a uniquely rich public pool culture, opening the first outdoor municipal pool in the US in 1883 (which functioned as a public bath for poor and immigrant communities who didn’t have indoor plumbing) and, with more than 70 pools, still boasting the largest number of public pools per resident of any large American city. In response to an outcry over drownings in nearby rivers and creeks, seven swim clubs cropped up around the middle of the century to serve both urban and suburban Black swimmers. (Several are still going strong today, including the nation’s first Black-owned swim club.) “Philadelphians love their pools,” Prizzia says. “They’re really important to the fabric of local neighborhoods. They’re like your extended family.” Beale-Tawfeeq knows that well: “I grew up understanding that learning to swim can actually save lives in more ways than one.” She joined the Philadelphia Parks and Recreation diving team at age 10, later was coached by the visionary Jim Ellis (who formed the country’s first Black swim team and was the subject of the 2007 film Pride), and eventually attended Howard University on an athletic scholarship. Now a physical-education educator, she touts swimming’s health benefits: “It’s a physical activity you can do from six months old until you’re 100.” Beale-Tawfeeq notes there’s trauma in the exhibition’s narratives, but an exuberant mural at the exhibition entrance hopes to balance that. Created by El Salvador– born, Philadelphia-based artist Calo Rosa and representing an offering to a Yoruba water goddess, the piece exhorts visitors to “dive in”. “We wanted to create an invitation to come in and enjoy too,” Prizzia says. “By excluding people from swimming, you’re also excluding them from a very natural joy. People gravitate toward water; everyone wants to play in it. Hopefully the exhibition is a pathway for people to learn to swim and have access to something that would bring them joy.” Pool: A Social History of Segregation is showing at the former Kelly Pool in the National Historic Landmark Fairmount Water Works until August 2022",Arts/Art and design,‘A story of social justice’: a history of racial segregation and swimming,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/23/pool-exhibition-segregation-swimming-philadelphia
