5/16/2022,"Voters in Lebanon have gone to the polls in the first national election since a disastrous economic collapse and an explosion that wrecked the Beirut waterfront in 2020, amid low expectations that the leaders they hold responsible will face a serious challenge to their stranglehold on the country. A number of civil society candidates lined up against an entrenched ruling elite with pledges to change a political landscape in which feudal lords and their networks have enriched themselves since the end of the civil war. The chances of a real breakthrough appeared slim as the polls closed on Sunday evening, with the most likely outcome being a return to some form of the status quo, where power is apportioned along established sectarian lines, with existing control structures barely diluted. In the run-up to the election, the former prime minister and leader of Lebanon’s Sunni Muslim community, Saad Hariri, had urged a voter boycott, and many of his followers appeared to pay heed, with low turnout in Sunni parts of the country amid a modest turnout nationwide. Many polling stations were without electricity and some were short on ballot papers, in a microcosm of the country’s continuing disintegration under fuel and power shortages, and hyperinflation as the local currency continues to lose value. At some polling centres, there was no shortage of the precious commodity of fresh dollars, which had been used to lure the support of last-minute voters, particularly families who had arrived with multiple members. “They have to give me something,” said one woman at a west Beirut polling station. “What else am I going to get from these people?” At another polling station in the Keserwan region, one voter, Joseph Karam, 41, said he had considered voting for civil society candidates, but had decided to cast his ballot for the Lebanese Forces, a civil-war-era party that has been resurgent in recent years and has won the patronage of Gulf states for its willingness to confront Lebanon’s dominant political bloc, Hezbollah. A total of 718 candidates from 15 electoral districts were running for seats in the 128-member parliament. Going into the poll, Hezbollah and its allies retained 71 seats. Their support base was expected to hold firm against a handful of secular Shia candidates and a push by mainstream parties backed by western states. The Lebanese Association for Democratic Elections said its delegates were forced to withdraw from two polling stations following threats by Hezbollah supporters and their allies in the Shia Amal group. While fistfights were reported at some booths, and there were claims of harassment by rival blocs at other locations, the poll seemed to have defied predictions of more serious unrest. “The issue now is counting these ballots,” said Anwar Habib, a voter from the southern city of Sidon. “This is not a secure process. Hezbollah and Amal will do anything they can to win.” Preliminary results were expected by Monday. Weeks of political horse-trading are then expected before a government is formed.",News/World news,Lebanon votes in first national election since onset of economic crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/15/lebanon-votes-polls-national-election-parliament
5/16/2022,"The former Munster legend Ronan O’Gara will be looking to overcome the favourites Leinster in Marseille on Saturday week. La Rochelle’s director of rugby saw his side defeat the Champions Cup nearly men Racing 92 in the stifling heat in northern France in the first game of professional rugby at Stade Bollaert-Delelis in Lens. It was physical and attritional but it was not pretty. Certainly these sides could not match Leinster’s stately progression to the final 24 hours earlier. La Rochelle will not beat the overwhelming favourites Leinster if they choose to play a high-tempo game next week but if the game is tight they are a match for anyone. O’Gara’s side, beaten 12 months ago at Twickenham in the final by Toulouse, have a monstrous pack and they have made great strides in the past 12 months. No one has made more carries in the competition this season than their captain, Grégory Alldritt, whose try on the stroke of half-time turned the game La Rochelle’s way and the No 8 was outstanding alongside the 35-year-old former All Black Victor Vito in the back row. Romantics will regret that the final will not be graced by Racing’s Nolann Le Garrec. The scrum-half turned 20 on Saturday but could not celebrate a win alongside his half-back partner Finn Russell, both outstanding the previous week against Sale in their quarter-final in Paris. Le Garrec has been lauded as the next Antoine Dupont but he had to watch Ihaia West finally kill off the game in the last move of the afternoon with a try that made up for the New Zealander’s wayward place-kicking that could have cost them the game. La Rochelle, though, deserved their victory. The day had not started well for Racing with the full-back Max Spring and the prop Trevor Nyakane pulling out with injuries but the Parisian side got their noses in front in a scrappy first half when both sides appeared to be racked by nerves in this, their first Champions Cup meeting. After Le Garrec had put Racing ahead with an early penalty his side scored the first try. The Racing pack drove forwards and Virimi Vakatawa saw his opportunity with a neat step and a stretch over the line. La Rochelle’s pack then began to stretch its muscles. Racing endured another injury blow when Ibrahim Diallo went low to halt the giant prop Uini Atonio and the flanker left the field dazed and confused. La Rochelle began to squeeze the life out of the Racing pack and, after a series of penalties and scrums, Alldritt powered over with the last move of the first half to take his side to within two points of Racing for whom the second half looked ominous. Racing changed their front row at the break. La Rochelle soon had a chance to take the lead for the first time but West fluffed his third kick of the afternoon when a straightforward penalty struck a post. Instead it was Racing who stretched their lead when Le Garrec landed a penalty five minutes later. Racing, though, put more pressure on themselves when their hooker Camille Chat, one of those replacements, was shown a yellow card for tackling a man without the ball. Suddenly the whole momentum of the game changed. La Rochelle’s pack rumbled forwards and the referee, Matthew Carley, awarded them a penalty try when the Racing No 8 Yoan Tanga was penalised for obstruction at the maul. Tanga was shown a yellow card and Racing were reduced to 13 players and a seemingly hopeless task of rescuing the game. Le Garrec had two opportunities to restore the lead for the 13 men with two penalties. But they drifted wide and La Rochelle sensed they were on their way to a second successive final.",Sport/Sport,West try seals La Rochelle’s win over Racing 92 to reach Champions Cup final,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/15/racing-92-la-rochelle-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report
5/16/2022,"Jeremy Hunt has been accused of ignoring serious NHS staff shortages for years and driving medics out of the profession while health secretary after he intervened this weekend to warn of a workforce crisis. Promoting his new book, Zero: Eliminating Unnecessary Deaths in a Post-Pandemic NHS, Hunt said tackling the “chronic failure of workforce planning” was the most important task in relieving pressure on frontline services. Now the chair of the health and social care committee, he said the situation was “very, very serious”, with doctors and nurses “run ragged by the intensity of work”. But his comments drew sharp criticism from healthcare staff, who said Hunt – the longest-serving health secretary in the 74-year history of the NHS – failed to take sufficient action to boost recruitment while in the top job between 2012 and 2018. Instead, critics said, his tenure saw health workers quit the NHS in droves for jobs abroad or new careers outside medicine. There are now 100,000 vacancies in the NHS, and the waiting list for treatment has soared to 6.4 million. “There’s an avalanche of pressure bearing down on the NHS. But for years Jeremy Hunt and other ministers ignored the staffing crisis,” said Sara Gorton, the head of health at Unison, the UK’s largest health union. “The pandemic has amplified the consequences of that failure. Experienced employees are leaving at faster rates than new ones can be recruited.” “Hunt has recently been an articulate analyst of current issues, particularly workforce shortages, but these haven’t come out of the blue,” said Dr Colin Hutchinson, the chair of Doctors for the NHS. “At the time he could have made the greatest impact, his response was muted. We have to ask: was the service people were receiving from the NHS better, or worse, at the end of his time in office? At the time when it most mattered, he was found wanting.” In an excerpt from his book, published in the Sunday Times, Hunt described sitting at the top of a “rogue system” while health secretary, and criticised a “blame culture” in the NHS that makes it “incredibly difficult for doctors, nurses and midwives to speak openly when things go wrong”. Dr Jenny Vaughan, chair of the Doctors’ Association UK, said Hunt was “correct” that the absence of “complete commitment” to transparency and honesty in healthcare “clearly provides the context for avoidable deaths and mistakes”. However, she raised questions over his failure to address staffing levels as health secretary and said she was “pleased” that he now accepts that “this should be an absolute priority”. She said: “Hunt says that doctors and nurses are exhausted and that the institution is crying out for renewal. Could he not have tried harder to improve what he knew to be seriously low staffing levels when he was in charge and handled the strike of junior doctors in a more compassionate way? His tenure was marked by many of them becoming disillusioned with the health service and leaving for other countries or changing career.” Speaking to the BBC on Sunday, Hunt called for every NHS patient to have access to their own named GP. Responding to his comments, Prof Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs (RCGP), said there were “many” advantages to continuity of care, but “intense workload and workforce pressures” make it “increasingly difficult to deliver, particularly when political focus consistently prioritises quick access”. In 2015, Hunt pledged to hire 5,000 more GPs within five years – but the total went down instead of up. In their 2019 manifesto, the Conservatives promised to recruit 6,000 more GPs by 2024, but Sajid Javid admitted last November that they were unlikely to hit their target. “Ultimately, the long-term solution that is really needed is an increased workforce with more GPs, more members of the practice team, and more time with our patients so that we can offer both good access and continuity of care for patients,” said Marshall. “The government have promised 6,000 more GPs and 26,000 more members of the practice team by 2024, and it’s imperative they pull out all the stops to deliver it.” Speaking to the BBC on Sunday, Hunt refused to rule himself out of a future Tory leadership contest, but said now was not the right moment. When asked if Boris Johnson was the right person to lead the Conservative party into the next election, Jeremy Hunt said he “hoped” so.",News/Politics,Jeremy Hunt ‘ignored’ NHS staff shortages while health secretary,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/15/jeremy-hunt-ignored-nhs-staff-shortages-while-health-secretary
5/16/2022,"End-of-season games often have a slightly curious dynamic, a sense of being played at cross-purposes. On the one hand, there was Manchester City battling for the win as they pursue a fourth league title in five years. On the other, West Ham basking in the knockings of a season well done and determined to celebrate the final home game of one of their greatest recent players, Mark Noble. When Noble came on with quarter of an hour remaining, what did that mean? He had played just 308 league minutes previously this season. Would he have come on had this not been his grand farewell? Does it matter? Would Liverpool fans who, if social media was anything to go by, were bizarrely aggrieved by the VAR award of an obvious penalty, have been aggrieved that West Ham in effect turned the final quarter of an hour into a testimonial? As it was, with Lukasz Fabianski saving that Riyad Mahrez penalty, the score remained 2-2, meaning that there is still life in the Premier League title race, that there remains the possibility that Steven Gerrard could at last win Liverpool a league title by leading his Aston Villa side to a point or better at the Etihad next weekend. But the Noble factor shaped the game. This was, after all, as the pitchside announcer insisted, Mark Noble Day: the post-match obsequies were so maudlin they might have been a funeral on EastEnders. There were montages – “one of our own”, “Canning Town-born, claret-and-blue-raised”, “that Custom House grit”; a voiceover from Danny Dyer; Ben Shephard on the pitch; testimony from fans, at least one of whom had named their dog after him; clips of him in various scenarios in various seasons, hair magnificently consistent (his son, happily, seems to have inherited the family parting); and a minute’s applause in the 17th minute in celebration of his No 16 shirt. Pep Guardiola gave him a hug and a lengthy lecture at the final whistle. Even Prince Albert II of Monaco came to pay his respects. This has been another good year for West Ham. There have been memorable wins over Liverpool and Chelsea, a Europa League run that will be talked about for years and a sense that the London Stadium has at last come to feel like home. Maybe they’ll qualify for the Europa League again, may have to be content with the Europa Conference League, but the distinction is never going to generate the sort of tension that might have impinged on the general good humour. One team was relaxed, one was not and, for a time, that threatened a serious upset. It wouldn’t quite be true to say West Ham were 2-0 up at half‑time by mistake, but there was an odd sense that the pressure that is usually induced by City’s domination of the ball simply wasn’t there. And when the ball was belted forward, when the space behind City’s characteristically high line was tested, Michail Antonio and Jarrod Bowen went galloping gleefully after it. It all seemed tremendous fun. City’s press was shaky, their willingness to compete for second balls limited. Were they really going to blow it in such a characteristic way? They did not, and a draw should still be enough. But this at least was a proper examination, they had to pass a test of their character and will have another one next Sunday. If they do hold on to defend the title, this will have been far harder won than the title of 2018-19, when City and Liverpool each cantered to win after win over the final two months of the season. This has been a run-in with at least a few twists and turns, with the possibility of one more to come. The pivotal moment, in the end, came after 65 minutes with the score at 2-1 as Antonio, inadvertently sent clean through by Fernandinho, pulled his chip over Ederson just wide. Had that gone in – or had Bowen not slightly selfishly dragged an effort into the side-netting when he might have squared it a minute earlier – this might still have been a costly afternoon for City. As it was, West Ham followed the path of so many David Moyes sides before them by dropping deeper and deeper, inviting pressure and, inevitably, conceding. With the scores level, West Ham immediately stepped out and City began to look threatened again. City had chances to win it and they were, of course, the better side, as xG has had them in every single game this season, but in the minutes after the penalty, as they chased a winner that would in effect have secured the league title, they were oddly lacking in imagination. Rodri was thrown up front, a glimpse of what a big No 9 might look like in a City side next season, an uncomfortable temporary addition to the lineage that runs from Niall Quinn to Erling Haaland, and crosses slung into the box – although the only player who actually got on the end of one of them was Vladimir Coufal, who scored the equaliser with a diving header into his own net. After two facile wins, this was all a little unconvincing from City. But that’s how it should be. That’s what title races are supposed to be about, the contenders choking on their anxieties as laid-back opponents with little to play for operate, for worse and sometimes for better, to a different set of priorities.",Sport/Football,Mark Noble’s farewell defuses drama of Manchester City’s title defence | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/15/mark-nobles-farewell-defuses-drama-of-manchester-citys-title-defence
5/16/2022,"The fashion retailer Next and the restaurant group behind Wagamama are facing a potential backlash over executive bonuses after both their chief executives received the highest pay since 2015 while benefiting from government support. Simon Wolfson, chief executive of Next, whose pay will be put to the vote on Thursday, took home almost £4.4m last year, up 50% on the year before after being awarded an annual bonus worth 100% of his basic salary and two share bonuses based on long-term performance. Andy Hornby, the chief executive of the Restaurant Group, which holds its annual general meeting on 24 May, was paid £1.2m, up from £518,000 a year before, as he collected his first annual bonus after more than two years in charge. It was the first time the group, which also owns the Frankie & Benny’s and Chiquito chains, paid out any annual bonus to a chief executive since 2017. The Institutional Voting Information Service (IVIS), which is part of the Investment Association and advises investors on corporate governance, has marked both companies’ annual remuneration reports with a “red top” warning, suggesting shareholders vote against. It has raised concerns about the bonuses at a time when both companies benefited from government support including furlough pay for workers and business rates relief. “Shareholders will need to be satisfied that the payment of bonuses was appropriate in a year when the company again participated in the government’s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and there is no clear indication whether the company has or intends to repay the support received from the government,” IVIS said of Next according to report seen by the Guardian. Next paid back £29m of business rates relief last summer, intended to cover the period when its shops were open. A spokesperson for the company said any further relief for when shops were open has also been repaid. It said Next received “no direct benefit” from furlough payments which covered 80% of workers’ pay while stores were closed, which the company topped up to workers’ usual rates. The annual report says the furlough support had allowed Next to continue to “employ talented colleagues whom we might otherwise have been required to make redundant”. The group’s remuneration committee added that executive pay was “proportionate and aligned to business performance”. IVIS said to back TRG’s remuneration report, shareholders would “have to be satisfied that the bonus payouts for 2021 are commensurate with the experience of employees and other stakeholders”, given the company’s use of furlough and business rates support and the suspension of dividends. TRG’s remuneration committee said it had reduced the executive bonus pay outs to 60% of their total. A spokesperson for the company said: “The board is mindful of a range of external and internal factors when considering its approach to remuneration and regularly consults its shareholders on these matters. “The business delivered a strong trading performance in 2021, following the reopening of its sites; however, in light of the Covid-19 pandemic and the receipt of significant government support, the remuneration committee felt it appropriate to reduce executive directors’ bonuses by 40%. During the pandemic, 2019 bonuses were voluntarily waived by directors and no bonuses at all were awarded in 2020. In addition, directors waived between 20% [and] 40% of their salaries through the pandemic for 12 months from March 2020.” Companies are facing close scrutiny over pay at annual shareholder meetings this year after a tough period for investors who have seen dividends cancelled and share prices hit during the pandemic. Bakery chain Greggs is this week facing a potential shareholder revolt over high pay for its executives despite not paying back £87m in government furlough support received in 2020. It did pay back £4.9m in furlough support received last year. Almost 30% of shareholders in Ocado rebelled against high pay for directors at the online grocery specialist after it laid out a plan to pay the chief executive, Tim Steiner, up to £100m over the next five years. Pharma group GlaxoSmithKline and Standard Chartered bank have also seen big votes against executive payouts.

5/16/2022,"The families who gathered in a Spanish cemetery beneath Saturday’s burning sun had waited 82 years. They weren’t going to let the 30C heat stop them doing what they had come to do. At 11am, Pit 111 of Paterna cemetery in the Valencia region finally gave up the remains of 21 of the 3,400 Republicans who were summarily executed by Franco’s forces after the end of the Spanish civil war, and whose bodies were tossed into an enormous and infamous mass grave. Shortly before the remains, which were identified using DNA, were returned to the families of the murdered in a solemn ceremony, a letter was read aloud by Vicenta Juan, secretary of the Pit 111 Association, which has worked to reunite the bodies of the dead with their descendants. In it, one of the victims, Germán Sanz, said a last goodbye to his wife and children. “If they kill me, it will be because I didn’t think like them and because I served my legally elected government,” it read. “I’m not afraid of dying, just of leaving you on your own. Forgive me, Rosa, for the sadness my death will cause you. I send a last hug to you, my dear wife, and to you my children. I want you to know that if there really is an afterlife, I’ll be waiting for you there. Goodbye forever from your husband and father, Germán Sanz.” Sanz and his fellow victims were shot between March and May 1940, almost a year after Franco’s victory in the Spanish civil war. All of the 150 bodies painstakingly recovered from the seven-metre depths of Pit 111 showed the same treatment, a coup de grâce shot to the head. They had lain in the earth of eastern Spain for almost nine decades as the country grappled with the legacy of the coup that brought Franco to power, with his dictatorship, and with political and social disagreements over how best to make peace with the past. Although neither Sanz’s remains, nor those of Juan’s grandfather, could be identified, others could. Much of the information on where the exhumations were based came from Leoncio Badía, a grave-digger who secretly passed details to the families of those killed. His meticulous record-keeping was vital to Arqueoantro, one of the associations that helps families find their civil war dead. While work to exhume the grave began in May 2020, efforts were badly affected by the pandemic. This weekend, at long last, brought the day for which so many families had prayed for. Lina Torres Baena, who was two years old when her father, Amadeo Torres Julián, was shot, wore black and clutched a carnation tied with a ribbon in the colours of the Second Spanish Republic as she received his remains, the pencil he used to write his letters home, and the soles of the shoes he was wearing on 6 April 1940. “He was 28 when he was shot,” said Lina’s daughter, Yolanda. Lina’s mother never spoke to her daughter about her father for fear of reprisals. It was only at the end of her life, when she got dementia, that she shared stories about him. “My mum is one of those who never knew anything about her father,” said Yolanda. “She’s one of the daughters of silence but she’s happy to have her father back now and to be able to bury him properly.” Nearby stood the family of Regino García Culebras, a Republican soldier whose murder left behind his wife and six children. “They arrested my father in 1939 and shot him on 27 March 1940,” said his daughter Rosa. “They gave him the most summary of trials and then they shot him. By then, we’d already been through a year of misery. We didn’t have to look for his remains for years because my mother always knew which grave he was in.” For those who gathered in Paterna on Saturday, the event was as overdue as it was welcome. Eighty-three years after it ended, the civil war and the subsequent dictatorship continue to cause personal pain and political skirmishes. Spain’s socialist-led government is hoping to build on landmark legislation from 2007 with a “democratic memory” bill intended to “settle Spanish democracy’s debt to its past”. Among its 65 articles are plans for a census and a national DNA bank to help locate and identify the remains of the tens of thousands of people who still lie in unmarked graves, a ban on groups that glorify the Franco regime, and a “redefinition” of the Valley of the Fallen, the hulking mausoleum outside Madrid where the dictator lay for 44 years until his exhumation in 2019. The plans have been criticised by the opposition conservative People’s party, which says the proposed legislation will serve only to “dig up grudges” and churn up the earth that was carefully tamped down with the post-Franco amnesty law and the so-called pact of forgetting. But for many, the recovery of remains is a basic human and democratic right. Clutching the box that held the remains of a man they never knew, the grandchildren of José María Balaguer Gómez, who was 56 years old when he was shot on 27 March 1940, said they had come to do what their parents and grandmother were never able to. “We’ve come,” said his granddaughter María, “to take him home. He’s coming home now.”",News/World news,‘He’s coming home’: mass grave in Valencia gives up Franco’s victims,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/15/hes-coming-home-mass-grave-in-valencia-gives-up-francos-victims
5/16/2022,"The supreme court is “dangerous to families and to freedoms in our country”, Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday, as justices prepare to finalize a draft ruling stripping almost have a century of abortion rights in the US. The House speaker railed against conservative judges appointed by former president Donald Trump in an interview Sunday on CNN’s State of the Union, in which she urged Democrats to keep their “eye on the ball” to protect other freedoms she sees under threat. “Beware in terms of marriage equality, beware in terms of other aspects,” she said. “Understand this. This is not just about terminating a pregnancy. This is about contraception, family planning. “This is a place where freedom and the kitchen table, issues of America’s families, come together. What are the decisions that a family makes? What about contraception for young people? It’s beyond just a particular situation. It’s massive in terms of contraception, in vitro fertilization, a woman’s right to decide.” Speaking the day after hundreds of protest events took place nationwide, Pelosi insisted Democrats had done what they could in terms of protecting abortion rights through legislation. She pointed out the House had passed a bill before the women’s health protection act failed in the Senate on Wednesday, and she said she was still optimistic of a resolution with the support of pro-choice Republicans. But she said the 60-vote requirement in the Senate was “an obstacle to many good things”, and that Democrats needed to rally ahead of November’s midterm elections to “get rid of the damage” caused by conservative justices, including Trump’s three appointments, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. “Whoever suspected a creature like Donald Trump would become president, waving a list of judges he would appoint, therefore getting the support of the far right and appointing those anti-freedom justices to the court?” she said. “This is not about a long game. We played a long game, we won Roe v Wade a long time ago, we voted to protect it over time. Let’s not take our eye off the ball. The ball is this court, which is dangerous to families, to freedoms in our country. “The genius of our founders was to have a constitution that enabled freedom to expand. This is the first time the court has taken back a freedom that was defined by precedent and respect for privacy.” Independent Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, on NBC’s Meet the Press, said he remained hopeful that abortion rights legislation could be resurrected before the midterms. “Nobody should think this process is dead. We should bring those bills up again, and again and again,” he said. “People cannot believe you have a supreme court and Republicans who are prepared to overturn 50 years of precedent. What we should do is on this bill end the filibuster, do everything that we can to get 50 votes on the strongest possible bill to protect a woman’s right to control her own body.” An NBC News poll conducted after the leak of a draft opinion and reported by the network Sunday showed six out of 10 voters were in favor of abortion rights, and that 52% of voters were “less likely” to support a candidate who backed the supreme court’s draft ruling. But the poll found that inflation and the economy remained the biggest concerns for voters as the midterms approach.",News/Law,Nancy Pelosi: supreme court ‘dangerous to families and to freedoms’,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/may/15/us-supreme-court-abortion-nancy-pelosi
5/16/2022,"Peter Tatchell has refused an invitation to be declared a “national treasure” at the Queen’s platinum jubilee because of the monarch’s “neglectful stance towards the LGBT+ community”. Tatchell, who has been campaigning for gay rights and equality since 1967, had been invited to attend the pageant outside Buckingham Palace as one of more than 100 “national treasures”. But he declined, stating his lifelong republicanism and also that: “To my knowledge, [the Queen] has never publicly acknowledged that LGBT+ people exist. The words lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender have never publicly passed her lips and she has never visited or been a patron of any LGBT+ charity.” He added: “To be ignored for 70 years feels like a deliberate snub.” In a letter to the platinum jubilee co-chair, former publishing titan Nicholas Coleridge, Tatchell also claims that for many years palace staff were prohibited from bringing same-sex partners to the Christmas ball. He also claims that “after the 1999 Soho gay pub bombing, which killed three people and injured over 70 others, the Queen did not visit the scene or the victims in hospital”. The pageant is due to take place on Sunday 5 June and will feature more than 10,000 participants – including members of the royal family – parading through the streets of Westminster and along the Mall to Buckingham Palace. For the finale, Coleridge invited Tatchell to be among an “ensemble of over one hundred ‘National Treasures’ to join us as we pay tribute to Her Majesty”. He explained that national treasures “means the celebrated, respected and admired people from many spheres – theatre, film, television, music, literature, sport, the sciences and business”. In an interview with the Guardian, Tatchell said the pageant was “propaganda for the anti-democratic system of an unelected and unaccountable head of state”. He added: “To join the celebration of the Queen’s reign would give legitimacy to an elitist and anti-LGBT+ monarch.” He said he also objected to the royal family because of the way future monarchs are chosen, with “the first-born of the all-white Windsor family” ascending to the throne. “For the foreseeable future no black or brown Briton, no matter how worthy, can be made head of state,” he said.

After Thatcher’s election, Norman Tebbit told us to get on our bikes; Norman Lamont told us a degree of unemployment was necessary to keep inflation down; Michael Portillo told us that we had no respect for authority (we proved it at the following election by kicking him out of his safe seat); John Major told us that we had to get back to basics and family values (before it was discovered that several of his colleagues had got back to basics with someone other than their wife, including Major himself); and today’s party is looking dangerously like the last days of Major.

5/16/2022,"Sam Kerr handed a battling Chelsea side the FA Cup and a domestic double in a 3-2 defeat of Manchester City that went to extra time. In front of a record FA Cup final crowd of 49,094 fans, the Australian forward scored the opener and the winner – her seventh and eighth goals in four consecutive domestic cup finals – to ensure Chelsea retained the title they won on 5 December. Lauren Hemp levelled for City before the break but Erin Cuthbert’s blistering strike from the edge of the box gave Chelsea the lead for a second time before a 89th-minute goal from the substitute Haley Raso took the final to extra time where Kerr pounced on a mistake from her compatriot Alanna Kennedy to race clear and score. There is no love lost between Manchester City and Chelsea, who have exchanged blows at the top of the Women’s Super League since 2015, with only Arsenal’s title win in 2019 and runner-up spot this term pushing either team out of the top two. The City manager, Gareth Taylor, had said it would be two teams “going at it, slugging it out” and he was not wrong. There was only one yellow card in the first half, which was collected by the City centre-back Kennedy, but the tackles came in thick and fast, with stoppages for the clattering of the Chelsea trio Cuthbert, Pernille Harder and Sophie Ingle, and the City forward Bunny Shaw. Despite City having had the better chances in the opening minutes, it was Chelsea who took the lead and the indomitable England centre-back Millie Bright powered the move, collecting the clearance from a Chelsea free-kick on the right before thumping the ball goalward only for Kerr to steal in and nod the final yard over the line it looked destined to cross anyway. There was a risk in the following period that City would be cowered, and Chelsea would exploit their bruised prey. First, Guro Reiten would lift a 30-yard effort over the bar with Ellie Roebuck miles off her line, then Harder would shoot wide from distance too. Having weathered that little storm of Chelsea pressure, City eased back into the tie and it was another England international, one to rival her compatriot Bright for the Lionesses’ in-form player this season, who made the breakthrough up the other end. Escaping a sliding challenge from the wing-back Jess Carter, Hemp skated back into the box from the left, wrongfooted Bright and sent her effort looping into the side-netting. In added time at the end of the half City could feel aggrieved when Shaw was felled by the centre-back Aniek Nouwen in the box but with no VAR and only goal-line technology in use there was no reassessment of the incident. Despite the rivalry that has developed between those in sky blue shirts and their opposites in royal blue, with the past five FA Cup finals won by one of the two teams, this was the first time they had met in the final. Chelsea and City had faced each other eight times in the FA Cup or league cup before this season, where they finally met in the final of each domestic cup competition. At Plough Lane, in the Continental League Cup final, City had edged Emma Hayes’s side, coming from a goal down to win 3-1 to clinch the first available silverware of the season. That match was almost a microcosm of City’s season, with a first-half capitulation followed by a surging fightback. The resurgence of Taylor’s side, after the first third of the season was crippled by a summer of injuries, meant that heading into this final it could be argued that it was City, having clinched a Champions League spot and won the league cup, who were the team to beat despite Chelsea having lifted the WSL title the week prior. While City’s race to third was done at a canter, Chelsea’s path to the title was torturous. Sign up for our new and free women’s football newsletter! The momentum of having crossed the line and lifted the title depleted and having dug deep cannot be underestimated, though, and it was fitting that it was the Blues’ biggest warrior who put Chelsea ahead for a second time, with Cuthbert lashing in off the bar from the edge of box with a ferocity that is characteristic of the Scot. In search of the leveller that would keep hopes of a cup double alive City pressed forward and the substitute Raso, with one minute of normal time remaining, scored a goal worthy of her Australian compatriot in opposition colours. Collecting the centre-back Alex Greenwood’s ball over the top, Raso chested the ball down and poked past the onrushing Ann-Katrin Berger. In extra time, unwilling to relinquish her status as Chelsea’s hero this season, Kerr latched on to the ball missed by Kennedy and charged away on a two-v-one break with the substitute Jessie Fleming alongside her. Going alone, Kerr’s shot took a deflection off the outstretched foot of Greenwood that caught out Roebuck and flew in, giving Chelsea the League Cup final revenge they craved.",Sport/Football,Chelsea clinch double as Sam Kerr sinks Manchester City to win FA Cup final,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/15/chelsea-manchester-city-womens-fa-cup-final-match-report
5/16/2022,"A British man has claimed the record for the most ascents of Mount Everest by a foreigner after standing on the summit of the world’s tallest mountain for the 16th time. Kenton Cool from Gloucestershire reached the top of the mountain in Nepal early on Sunday morning, according to a post on his Instagram page. The 48-year-old’s initial push for the summit was delayed due to high winds, which forced his team to wait below the peak. Many Nepali guides who help tourists to climb the mountain have completed substantially more ascents of Everest. The current record holder is Kami Rita Sherpa, who last week climbed the mountain for the 26th time at the age of 52. In an Instagram post, Cool paid tribute to the local guides, who he said had “worked super hard on our behalf”, calling them the “superheroes of the mountain”. Cool has previously climbed Everest with other mountaineers including Sir Ranulph Fiennes and the broadcaster Ben Fogle. He was told he would never walk again unaided after he shattered both heel bones in a rock-climbing accident in 1996. He defied those predictions with a year of surgery and therapy, but still suffers from chronic pain. Speaking to the PA news agency via satellite phone ahead of the final leg of the climb, Cool said conditions were looking good, with a “great weather forecast” and a “great team”. “Overconfidence on a mountain like Everest is a dangerous thing, so nothing is assured until you’re back down at base camp,” he said. May is the most popular time to climb the world’s highest peak, and the Nepali government has issued 316 permits to climb Everest during the current peak season, according to Reuters. The large numbers of people trying to complete the ascent in a short period of time has previously resulted in negative coverage of queues to reach the top – and of the debris left behind by some mountaineers. But the mountaineering industry also brings in substantial income for Nepal and supports thousands of jobs in the region around Everest, which was hit hard when global tourism collapsed during the coronavirus pandemic. According to the Kathmandu Post, as many as 150 climbers made it to the top of Everest in a day last week, including a group of black climbers who were taking part in an expedition designed to improve diversity in the mountaineering industry.",News/World news,British man claims record for most Everest ascents by non-Nepali,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/15/british-man-claims-record-most-everest-ascents-kenton-cool
