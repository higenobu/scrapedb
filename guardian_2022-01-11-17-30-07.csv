1/11/2022,"Heathrow airport has said at least 600,000 passengers cancelled their travel plans from the airport in December because of Omicron, warning aviation would take years to recover from the pandemic. Only 19.4 million passengers passed through the airport in 2021 – less than a quarter of 2019 levels and below even 2020, the year when the Covid-19 pandemic started in March.  Heathrow said passengers cancelled their travel plans last month because of the Omicron variant and the uncertainty caused by swiftly imposed government travel restrictions. The UK’s busiest airport again urged the government to remove all testing requirements for fully vaccinated passengers and to adopt a playbook for any future variants of concern that is more predictable. The Heathrow chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said: “There are currently travel restrictions, such as testing, on all Heathrow routes – the aviation industry will only fully recover when these are all lifted and there is no risk that they will be reimposed at short notice, a situation which is likely to be years away.” He said there was significant doubt over the speed at which demand will recover. The International Air Transport Association, the industry body, forecasts that passenger numbers will not reach pre-pandemic levels until 2025, on the assumption travel restrictions are removed at both ends of a route and travellers have confidence the curbs will not return rapidly. Travel firms reported a surge in bookings last week after the government relaxed travel restrictions, ditching the requirement for a pre-departure test for UK arrivals who will not have to self-isolate until they receive the result from the day two test, which has been changed from a PCR test to a cheaper lateral flow test. EasyJet and Tui said the biggest jump was in bookings to the Canary Islands. Heathrow also called for help from the regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, which has approved an interim rise in landing charges from £22 to £30.19 a passenger. The airport had called for higher charges of up to £43 to help recoup losses caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The levy is likely to be passed directly on to travellers.",News/UK news,"Heathrow demands end to Covid testing for vaccinated as 600,000 cancel flights",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/11/heathrow-covid-testing-vaccinated-cancel-flights-omicron
1/11/2022,"Nilüfer Yanya may have grown up in Chelsea, but hers is not the world of the Sloane Ranger 2.0: pristine Georgian townhouses and endless champagne brunches. Instead, it is the manic, deadening, claustrophobic side of the city that radiates through her work: on recent single Stabilise, the 26-year-old sings of never-ending high rises, filled with small flats “rotten to the core”. “Grey concrete,” she says. “I see that immediately when the song starts. A literal grey but also an emotional grey.”  Today we are in the first kind of London – a posh, gleaming, pink-accented coffee shop in Bayswater – discussing Yanya’s upcoming second album, Painless, a collection of prickly, occasionally jazzy, and always catchy post-punk that lands somewhere between Joy Division, King Krule and PJ Harvey. It is the sequel to 2019’s rave-reviewed Miss Universe, a record that heralded this unassuming, smiley woman as one of Britain’s most exciting new rock stars. And yet, in spite of her uniformly excellent output, Yanya’s rise seems highly unusual. Not because it was sparked by a flukey moment of internet-fuelled hype – but because it wasn’t. Instead, it involved nothing more newfangled than gigging around London throughout her teens and early 20s, signing to an independent label and, then, more of the same. Granted, she was offered some (questionable) shortcuts along the way, such as the time she dodged involvement in a doomed manufactured girl band with links to One Direction’s Louis Tomlinson, an industry approach Yanya sums up as: “‘Let’s go and pinch some young people, tell them we’re going to make a really successful group but we’re obviously going to make a lot more money than them.’ It’s a very selfish thing to do.” Even more so considering she heard the entire project was unceremoniously ditched a year later. In any case, being a pop star was never on Yanya’s radar. You don’t make sour, spiky, impressionistic rock songs if you want to be top of the charts, or, indeed, if you want to surf the zeitgeist: Painless doesn’t exactly correspond with the current sound of young London. Do her friends listen to guitar music? “Not massively,” she admits. It’s also not the music some people expected her to make, going by her name (her father is Turkish) and her appearance (she is mixed race). “Some people have [described it as] R&B and it’s like: where are you getting that from? There’s a very small element of that in any music I’ve released.” It was boys with guitars that shaped her musical ambitions from the start. A talented pianist as a child, she was turned on to “pop-rock, skater-punk, and the Strokes” by her elder sister. “It was weird because I didn’t really listen to any female singers; the only music that was ‘credible’ was by guys. Obviously I never realised that, I just thought this is cool. I didn’t think ‘I feel excluded.’” Without seeing any women doing it, how did she know she could? “I just wanted to try. I guess I wasn’t worrying about it being commercially successful; I wasn’t thinking: how am I going to make this a TikTok hit.” Not that she’s totally off the hook in that regard: she is now being encouraged by her team to promote her wares on the platform: “It’s a young person’s thing; I feel like I’m past that. Can’t I just be an adult now?!” For Yanya, adulthood hasn’t only involved a creeping ambivalence towards social media; it has also turned her attention towards her Turkish heritage. Painless features a saz, the stringed instrument her father used to play around the house, and she has recently started taking Turkish lessons. Her younger self shared none of this enthusiasm. “When you grow up here and your parents are from other countries, you want to disassociate in some way,” she says. “You’re like: ‘No, I just want to be from London, I don’t want to have to deal with all this other stuff.’” She still feels like she’s only just starting to understand Turkish culture: “I don’t really know anything. My mum’s Irish and Bajan so there’s so much going on, I don’t really know myself most of the time.” It doesn’t help that the music industry tends to treat her background in a reductive, flattening way. “‘You’re Turkish, great, we’ve got that covered’ or ‘You’re mixed race, cool, got that ticked.’ They’re like: ‘Well we need people who aren’t just white now, but you still look white so that’s even better.’” One weapon against industry cynicism is to surround yourself with people who genuinely have your best interests at heart – and Yanya has managed to keep her career a family affair. At 16, she recorded her first song in her uncle’s Cornwall studio, a tradition she has continued with Painless. Her younger sister, Elif, sometimes joins her on tour as a backing singer, while her elder sister Molly directs her music videos. With Molly, she has also set up an initiative called Artists in Transit that brings creative workshops to refugee children, initially in Greece and now in London. “You’re just talking to people, making nice things,” explains Yanya. “Their parents just want them to have a nice time no matter where they are, so we’re playing to that. I don’t know how to help people get out of that situation, [but] I think the first step is getting to know people and bridging some sort of gap.” As the child of two visual artists, creativity has been a constant in Yanya’s life. But the arts, she notes, seem increasingly undervalued in the UK. A case in point: she attended Pimlico School, known for fostering music talent (alumni include La Roux’s Elly Jackson, Roots Manuva and Dave Okumu of the Invisible, who also taught Yanya music there). Halfway through her education, the school was converted into an academy and music teaching cut by half. She despairs of the way creativity has become “a luxury. It shouldn’t be something for people that have extra money or extra time. Why can’t everyone take part?”. School music lessons, giving young refugees a creative outlet: the arts are not just a nice-to-have, says Yanya, they are an essential. “It’s a way of communicating, it crosses cultures. When you cut people off from being able to do that, it’s like cutting off an arm.” It’s not difficult to agree – and if anyone remains sceptical about the benefits of encouraging creativity in childhood, an encounter with Yanya’s exhilarating music is sure to change their minds. Painless is released on 4 March.",Arts/Music,Nilüfer Yanya: ‘I wasn’t thinking: how am I going to make this a TikTok hit’,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/11/nilufer-yanya-i-wasnt-thinking-how-am-i-going-to-make-this-a-tiktok-hit
1/11/2022,"It’s a point in 2022’s favour that, rather than violent insurrection or the misery of lockdown, most English-speaking people on the internet are currently preoccupied with a harmless word game. Harmless at the time of writing, I should say – it’s popular enough that some kind of backlash is inevitable. I’m sure any day now Wordle will be revealed as a Bad Thing and I don’t want to speculate how; I am merely here to observe that it is a) a lot of fun b) linguistically interesting, and I’d like to explain why. I may even be able to make you a bit better at it. If you don’t already know, Wordle is a browser-based puzzle that gives you six goes at guessing a five-letter word. If your guess includes a letter that’s correct but in the wrong place, it turns yellow (more like ochre – now there’s a good starting word for you). If it includes a letter that’s correct and in the right place, it turns green, allowing you to build on your guesses until you hit the jackpot. The solution to the Wordle in the screenshot above is “craze”.  It’s helpful to understand what Wordle is mainly testing, and I think there are a couple of things: first, your knowledge of the frequency of individual letters in the English language – that is, how common they are (think of the value of letters in scrabble – “q” is 10 because it’s harder to find words that use it, whereas “e” is 1). So it would be unwise, for example, to use “hyrax” as your first guess. More interestingly, though, it probes your instinct for how letters can be combined. Very often you find yourself thinking: I’ve got an “o” an “r” and a “t”. Do many English words end in “o”? Is “t” a good bet to start the word with? Should it be followed by “r”, or should there be a vowel in between them? OK, so most of us will have a sense of how to answer these questions already, because we use words every day and have a gut feeling for which sequences are possible where, and which aren’t allowed at all (“ng”, for example, is pretty common in English, but never at the beginning of a word, and “lng” never appears anywhere). But linguistics can help a bit. There is actually a whole branch of it that looks at the way sounds enter into sequences, and it’s called phonotactics. Each language has its own phonotactic constraints – such as the rule that says “ng” can’t start a word in English (it can, and does, in Māori and Swahili). Then there are rules that determine the possible order of consonants in a syllable: “tr” is fine at the beginning of a syllable but not the end, and the reverse is true for “rt”. “Bl” and “lb” follow the same pattern. That’s not actually a coincidence. There’s a mechanism behind it called the “sonority sequencing principle” or SSP. Certain sounds, often “hard” ones like “t”, “b” or “g”, are not very sonorous, or resonant. Softer sounds like “r”, “l” and “w” are a bit more sonorous, and vowels are very sonorous. In a syllable that contains consonant clusters, the less sonorant sounds will tend to appear at the beginning, there will be a sonority peak in the form of a vowel, and then a gradual downward slope back to something less sonorous. “Blurb” is a lovely example of this, as is “twerk” or “plump”. “Rbubl”, an impossible word, violates SSP because “r” is more sonorous than “b”, and “b” is less sonorous than “l”. Within this framework, some combinations of sounds are seen way more often than others: “tr” and “pr” are everywhere, but “dw” is pretty unusual, appearing in “dwell” and “dweeb”, with “dz” rarer still – “adzes” may be the only Wordle-able example. Why do we see this rise and fall pattern with sonority? Basically, it makes things easier for both the speaker (the transition between sounds requires less effort if there’s a gradient rather than a sudden leap) and the hearer (syllables are more distinct when there are less sonorant, more abrupt sounds at the edges). As a bizarre aside, some researchers believe that climate has an effect on the ratio of sonorant to not-so-sonorant sounds in a language. In places with higher temperatures, which can distort high frequency sounds, languages may have fewer consonants and simpler syllables as a result. Anyway, the reason it’s useful to think about SSP when you’re Wordle-ing is because it can guide you towards more likely sequences and away from unlikely or impossible ones. There is something to beware of here, however, and it’s the fact that in English there often isn’t a one-to-one correspondence between sounds and letters. “Sh” is actually one sound, not a combination of “s” and “h” – but it’s still represented by two letters, whereas “e” can indicate no sound at all, as in “craze”, which ends phonetically with a “z”. SSP was described with sounds in mind, and doesn’t always work perfectly with letters. I await a version of Wordle for linguistic purists that uses the international phonetic alphabet, but until then, a little bit of phonotactics might still be enough to give you an edge. Good luck!

1/11/2022,"As if Jos Buttler’s Ashes series had not been painful enough, a campaign that included one particularly humiliating drop – to spare a century-bound Marnus Labuschagne in Adelaide – and a combined 45 runs across his last six innings has ended with a broken finger and an early flight home. Buttler averages 35.68 in 20 Tests as a specialist batter compared with 29.60 in 37 as wicketkeeper, including just 19.04 against Australia at home and away, leaving his long-term place in the team in doubt. First a new keeper has to be found to end the series. Jonny Bairstow, the obvious candidate, has his own injury to nurse, and though Ollie Pope did admirably as stand-in in Sydney Sam Billings is widely expected to make his Test debut. At 30 Billings has experience across all formats and also as a captain, but he has only played 11 first-class matches in the last three years, keeping wicket in just two of those. This will not be an easy audition.  Given their struggles getting the Kookaburra to swing the only curveballs England have produced in Australia have been with their team selections. Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson watched from the sidelines as the opening Test was played on a green pitch, Mark Wood and Jack Leach missed the second, Broad was eased out again for the third. The series has exposed the English bowlers’ limitations but also their qualities, with Wood’s pace in particular discomfiting the Australians. He was hit on the foot in being trapped lbw by Pat Cummins in Sydney and is dealing with the resulting bruise, while Ben Stokes’ injury seems likely to keep the ball out of his hands in Hobart. Who knows what surprises England have in store, but Ollie Robinson and Chris Woakes, the unlikely new-ball pairing in the opening game, stand by for potential returns. It is a sad fact that England’s most successful opener in the last five years – of those who have performed the role more than once – has been Jack Leach even though in one of his two attempts he was out for one. The tourists go into the final game of the series wondering whether Rory Burns, discarded after the first two matches, is less of a liability than Haseeb Hameed, who since the opening game has scored 6, 0, 0, 7, 6 and 9. Hameed, who spent five years in the international wilderness after his breakthrough in India in 2016, now seems likely to return there, with Burns and Dawid Malan the most obvious candidates to replace him. Zak Crawley’s place is secure after his 77 in Sydney. The 23-year-old does not always please the purists but it was a fine innings, impressive particularly against the short ball, and across the series only Travis Head (twice) has faced 50 or more balls with a superior strike rate to his 77. Expect more experimentation when England head to the West Indies in March. It is ridiculously premature to label this a problem given Root famously ended 2021 with 1,708 runs across the calendar year at an average of 61. But by the end of the year a cloud had formed on his horizon, and it was Scott Boland-shaped. It was the 32-year-old who, on his debut, ended the final innings of Root’s annus mirabilis in Melbourne, and since his half-century in the first knock of that game the England captain has faced 22 Boland deliveries, hit one scoring shot and been dismissed three times, twice caught in the slips and once by the wicketkeeper. Thankfully Boland is nursing sore ribs which were bruised when he fell in his follow-through in Sydney and might not be cleared to play in the final Test. It is possible to argue that given their lack of preparation England were always going to flop in their first few matches of the series, and rather than wallowing in that misery their fans should revel in Sydney’s signs that the giant is finally rousing. It is wise not to go overboard here, but despite his injury Stokes batted excellently in the fourth Test, as did the returning Bairstow, while Leach bowled better and to better fields. There is no hiding from England’s inferiority across the series, but with a strong performance in Hobart their failure will at least be given a sheen of respectability. And perhaps the series might end with Anderson adding another record to his growing collection: he is just 14 runs away from becoming the highest-scoring No 11 of all time.",Sport/Sport,Five questions for England to resolve for the fifth and final Ashes Test  | Simon Burnton,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/11/five-questions-for-england-to-resolve-for-the-fifth-and-final-ashes-test
1/11/2022,"Over the years, footballers agitating for a transfer have concocted all manner of schemes and ruses in an attempt to secure their dream move. The well-placed media briefing: classic. Refusing to turn up for pre-season training: an old favourite. Few players, however, have gone to the trouble of commissioning and writing a 220-page graphic novel purely for the purpose of earning a move to Real Madrid. You didn’t need to a be a literature scholar to glimpse the subtext of “Je M’Appelle Kylian”, the comic-book autobiography released by Kylian Mbappé in November in collaboration with the illustrator Faro. The young Mbappé makes no secret of his desire to play for Real Madrid when he is older, to the point where in one early passage he is even visited in a dream by Cristiano Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane. In the dream, Ronaldo and Mbappé do keepie-uppies while Zidane hands him a freshly laundered white Madrid kit. Later, Mbappé is invited to Madrid for real, an experience he describes as “the best of his life”.  Later still, Mbappé is at Monaco when Paris Saint-Germain come in with a record-breaking bid. “Are you sure about your choice?” Mbappé’s mother asks him. “You know that Madrid still want to sign you. You’re not going to get bored in Ligue 1?” At which point, Mbappé’s representatives inform them they are close to an agreement with PSG that will see Mbappé earning €18m a year plus bonuses. “Ummm, that’s not bad,” Mbappé grimaces, with a grudging acceptance that the wheels of this high-end transfer had been irrevocably set in motion. I mean, as graphic metaphor goes, Maus this is not. And yet as Mbappé enters the last six months of his contract at PSG and his move to Real begins to take on a ring of inevitability, it’s worth re-examining the basic absurdity of what is being proposed here. One of the world’s richest clubs – under no real financial pressure – is about to lose one of the world’s best players for nothing, in part because Ronaldo visited him in a dream. Someone here, you feel, is getting mugged off. Watching Mbappé in PSG’s rain-sodden 1-1 draw at Lyon on Sunday night offered a few clues. Mbappé wasn’t the best player on the pitch, or very possibly the best player on his own side (that was probably Marquinhos). But as PSG – already 10 points clear in Ligue 1 – toiled at a deserted Stade Groupama, somehow the moments when Mbappé got the ball were the only times the game seemed to mean anything at all. He dipped and swerved and wriggled out of three-man challenges. He hit the post with a free-kick from a heroically unpromising angle. At his best Mbappé takes the game into new places, unfamiliar places; places you didn’t think football could go. The contrast with what was unfolding around him was stark. For all their bloodless excellence, PSG seem a particularly unhappy club at the moment, on the pitch as well as off. Every attack seems strained. Every win feels like a temporary relief from agony. Every new week seems to bring fresh revelations from the dressing room, a sort of sporting Great Gatsby where everyone is partying but nobody is really having any fun. A couple of weeks ago a big L’Equipe exposé lifted the lid on the many fissures at the club. The indulgence of Lionel Messi, who reportedly missed training the morning after a private party to celebrate his Ballon d’Or win, has been met with indignation. Keylor Navas and Gianluigi Donnarumma are currently engaged in a gloriously bitchy fracas over the goalkeeper’s jersey. Mauro Icardi’s marriage has been in crisis. Meanwhile, Achraf Hakimi is said to be unhappy with the lack of defensive structure (to which the only response is: did you not read the letterhead? Who, exactly, did you think was signing you?) Few individuals capture this malaise like the increasingly forlorn Mauricio Pochettino, the alchemist-coach who seems more tangential with every passing week. Putatively, he’s the man in charge. In reality he’s little more than a bystander, the coaching equivalent of Rowan, the training instructor in The Office: helplessly looking on as the lovelorn Icardi bares his soul, Mbappé describes his ultimate fantasy in unsparing detail (“Ronaldo. Zidane. I’m just watching”) and Neymar strums Freelove Freeway on his acoustic guitar. This is, if you think about it, quite some achievement. A 37-year-old Qatari billionaire buys a football club with an unlimited budget to attract the world’s best players to one of its greatest cities. Over the course of a decade he wins seven league titles by a combined margin of 101 points. On paper – and let’s set aside the morality of the thing for a minute – this sounds like the most riotously fun project in the history of football. And yet for some reason, it’s not. It feels malcontent and unsatisfying and overwrought and over-serious and thoroughly joyless. Is this why Mbappé is leaving? Probably not, although it certainly doesn’t help. On one level perhaps this is just a loveless marriage that has simply run its course, as well the fulfilment of an inexorable childhood dream. And yet whatever Mbappé’s motivations it’s hard not to see this as a judgment on PSG too: a club that for all its riches seems to have lost its way, lost itself, forgotten why it got into this in the first place. When you have all the money in the world, few players are ever truly irreplaceable. And yet PSG may just discover that Mbappé is one of them.",Sport/Football,Kylian Mbappé’s graphic yearning for Real Madrid lays bare PSG’s joyless state | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/11/kylian-mbappes-graphic-yearning-for-real-madrid-lays-bare-psgs-joyless-state
1/11/2022,"An Indiana state senator has backtracked on his remarks that teachers must be impartial when discussing nazism in classrooms after he sparked widespread backlash. During a state senate committee hearing last week about Senate Bill 167, a proposed bill that would ban “concepts that divide”, Republican Senator Scott Baldwin, who co-wrote the bill, said teachers should remain unprejudiced when teaching lessons about fascism and nazism.  “Marxism, nazism, fascism … I have no problem with the education system providing instruction on the existence of those ‘isms’,” Baldwin said, adding, “I believe we’ve gone too far when we take a position … We need to be impartial.” He went on to say that teachers should “just provide the facts” and that he is “not sure it’s right for us to determine how that child should think and that’s where I’m trying to provide the guardrails”. Baldwin has since walked back on his remarks. In an email to the Indianapolis Star last Thursday, he said that his intention with the bill was to make sure teachers are being impartial when discussing and teaching “legitimate political groups”. “When I was drafting this bill, my intent with regard to ‘political affiliation’ was to cover political parties within the legal American political system,” Baldwin said. “In my comments during committee, I was thinking more about the big picture and trying to say that we should not tell kids what to think about politics.” He went on to denounce the aforementioned ideologies, saying, “nazism, Marxism and fascism are a stain on our world history and should be regarded as such, and I failed to adequately articulate that in my comments during the meeting. I believe that kids should learn about these horrible events in history so that we don’t experience them again in humanity.” SB 167 was filed in recent weeks in response to the fierce debates that have emerged across Indiana and the rest of the country in the past year regarding the ways schools should teach children about racism, history and other subject matters. The bill prohibits kindergarten through 12th grade schools from teaching students that “any sex, race, ethnicity, religion, color, national origin, or political affiliation” is inherently superior, inferior, racist, sexist, oppressive. Teachers would also be prohibited from making individuals feel “discomfort, guilt, anguish, responsibility or any other form of psychological distress” when it comes to meritocracy and the notion that it was created by one group to oppress another. The bill also prohibits teachers and curriculums from teaching that Indiana and the United States was founded as a racist or sexist state or nation. The midwest chapter of the Anti-Defamation League has criticized Baldwin’s apology, arguing that it “doesn’t change the deep harms of using ‘impartiality’ or ‘neutrality’ as tools to sanitize history”. “This is part of the continued efforts by some to try and rewrite history and characterize extremism, racism, and genocide as somehow legitimate That is dangerous and despicable. It should be categorically, universally, and loudly rejected,” the organization added. The incident comes less than three months after a north Texas school official said that classrooms with books on Holocaust must offer “opposing” viewpoints.",News/Education,GOP state senator walks back comments on Nazi history in schools,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/11/gop-senator-backtracks-comments-nazism
