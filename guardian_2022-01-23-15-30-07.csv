1/23/2022,"The term “rogue male”, denoting a rampaging bull elephant, is also used figuratively to describe a dangerously out-of-control, cold-hearted loner. It may be that Vladimir Putin has a cuddly side. If so, it’s well-hidden. Russia’s president fits the rogue male profile to a T – unscrupulous, vicious, cunning, and ever ready to trample on other people and countries. Much recent effort has been expended trying to understand and explain Putin’s motives in threatening a wider war in Ukraine. Does he hope to restore past Soviet glories or crush Kyiv’s pro-western trajectory? Is it about his historical legacy or his need for a repeat electoral “Crimea bounce”? Such theories carry weight, but they all miss the essential point.  Putin is and always has been an unpleasant, smirking, devious, KGB-trained thug whose main aim in life, besides retaining power, is to weaken and divide the western democracies. His attitude, resembling a vendetta, is as emotional as it is rational. Ukraine is but his latest solo sabotage operation. If he gets his way there, his one-man mission to create an updated Russian sphere of influence bordered by puppet states will accelerate. Next stop, the Baltic republics, the Balkans, or an increasingly politically isolated Poland. The rogue male phenomenon is brilliantly explored in Geoffrey Household’s eponymous 1939 novel, in which a solitary huntsman sets out to assassinate an un-named European dictator, presumed to be Adolf Hitler – one rogue male tracking down another. The book amplifies one of history’s great might-have-beens: whether, with the Nazi leader dead, war could have been averted. No one, as far as can be known, is planning to assassinate Putin to prevent war in Ukraine – and all good liberals would surely condemn so heinous an idea. Regrettably, he himself has exhibited no such scruples when silencing critics and opponents over the past 20 years. The late Alexander Litvinenko, Anna Politkovskaya and Boris Nemtsov are three among many. So the question now is how to treat the chronic RMS (rogue male syndrome) from which Putin evidently suffers. Just think about it. Almost single-handed, he has whipped up the biggest east-west confrontation of the post-Soviet era. Who sent troops to the border? Who is waving ultimatums at Nato? Who now hints at deploying nuclear weapons in “rogue states” Venezuela and Cuba, and plays footsie with Iran? It’s Putin. As panicked western leaders scramble like Spitfire pilots (but without the same determination), a slight air of exaggeration and theatrical hype persists around Russian actions. Putin is certainly enjoying western discomfort. He’s already made significant geopolitical gains. But is he really serious about all-out invasion? Despite much Kremlin tub-thumping, there’s scant enthusiasm among the Russian public for a ground war in Ukraine – no great patriotic, nationalist surge, only fatalistic acceptance. It’s obvious, too, that no western leader wants to lock horns (or tusks) over Ukraine, any more than in Crimea in 2014. EU disunity over what to do, typified by Germany’s fractious coalition and the way Brussels has let itself be bypassed, is embarrassing but telling. For all its tough words, Nato also hangs back. As for US president Joe Biden, he pledged to end wars, not engage in new ones. Last week’s excruciating “minor incursion” gaffe left his aides counting marbles. Ukrainians, naturally, are against being invaded again. Their leaders are successfully leveraging the crisis to obtain greater security assistance and weaponry from the US and Britain. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, wants sanctions on Russia imposed immediately. But like western Europe, Kyiv’s strong preference is clear: no more war. The same goes for Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, understandably worried that, if push comes to shove, Nato’s protective shield may not be all it’s cracked up to be. In Taiwan, they fret that a Ukraine invasion will create a precedent. But Xi Jinping, China’s president, is a more subtle adversary. He doesn’t want war with the west, either – not yet, anyway. Russia’s worries over Nato’s intentions and future membership for Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia are not baseless. But they are overcooked. If war comes, it will accentuate the pro-western trends in the old “near abroad” Putin so dislikes. As the US secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, noted in Berlin last week, there is genuine western willingness to address Russian concerns. It’s plain, in sum, that almost no one, Moscow hawks and Donbas militia headbangers aside, wants an escalating conflict. It’s plain, too, that if it happens, Ukraine will go down as one man’s war, provoked, prosecuted and publicly owned by Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin. The west is complicit in this crisis. Its leaders have known what kind of man Putin is since the brutal second Chechen war. He invaded Georgia in 2008 and seized Crimea in 2014. He’s overseen chemical weapons atrocities in Syria, hostile cyber operations in Europe, pernicious anti-democratic election meddling, and multiple murders and poisonings. Yet they continue, for the most part, to treat him as a normal leader. Whether or not he ultimately attacks Ukraine again, directly or indirectly, Putin is a proven, ongoing global menace. He went rogue years ago. His behaviour grows steadily more threatening. So what kind of elephant trap would snare him? How to tie him down? Start now by declaring Putin an international pariah. Launch multiple universal jurisdiction prosecutions over his alleged complicity in overseas assassinations, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Sanction his cronies. Go after his money. Limit diplomatic contacts. Find alternative energy suppliers. Help democrats such as Alexei Navalny rid Russia of him. In short, freeze him out. The world has been here before, many times. One screwed-up little man must not be allowed to start a war no one wants.

1/23/2022,"What can possibly explain Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema’s decision to sink voting rights protections? Why did they create a false narrative that the legislation had to be “bipartisan” when everyone, themselves included, knew bipartisanship was impossible?  Why did they say they couldn’t support changing Senate filibuster rules when only last month they voted for an exception to the filibuster that allowed debt ceiling legislation to pass with only Democratic votes? Why did they co-sponsor voting rights legislation and then vote to kill the very same legislation? Why did Manchin vote for the “talking filibuster” in 2011 yet vote against it now? Part of the answer to all these questions can be found in the giant wads of corporate cash flowing into their campaign coffers. But if you want the whole answer, you need also to look at the single biggest factor affecting almost all national politicians I’ve dealt with: ego. Manchin’s and Sinema’s are now among the biggest. Before February of last year, almost no one outside West Virginia had heard of Manchin and almost no one outside Arizona (and probably few within it) had ever heard of Sinema. Now, they’re notorious. They’re Washington celebrities. Their photos grace every major news outlet in America. This sort of attention is addictive. Once it seeps into the bloodstream, it becomes an all-consuming force. I’ve known politicians who have become permanently and irrevocably intoxicated. I’m not talking simply about power, although that’s certainly part of it. I’m talking about narcissism – the primal force driving so much of modern America but whose essence is concentrated in certain places such as Wall Street, Hollywood and the United States Senate. Once addicted, the pathologically narcissistic politician can become petty in the extreme, taking every slight as a deep personal insult. I’m told Manchin asked Joe Biden’s staff not to blame him for the delay of Build Back Better and was then infuriated when Biden suggested Manchin bore some of the responsibility. I’m also told that if Biden wants to restart negotiations with Manchin on Build Back Better, he’s got to rename it because Manchin is so angry he won’t vote for anything going by that name. The Senate is not the world’s greatest deliberative body but it is the world’s greatest stew of egos battling for attention. Every senator believes he or she has what it takes to be president. Most believe they’re far more competent than whoever occupies the Oval Office. Yet out of 100 senators, only a handful are chosen for interviews on the Sunday talk shows and very few get a realistic shot at the presidency. The result is intense competition for attention. Again and again, I’ve watched worthy legislation sink because particular senators didn’t feel they were getting enough credit, or enough personal attention from a president, or insufficient press attention, or unwanted press attention, or that another senator (sometimes from the same party) was getting too much attention. Several people on the Hill who have watched Sinema at close range since she became a senator tell me she relished all the attention she got when she gave her very theatrical thumbs down to increasing the minimum wage, and since then has thrilled at her national celebrity as a spoiler. Biden prides himself on having been a member of the senatorial “club” for many years before ascending to the presidency and argued during the 2020 campaign that this familiarity would give him an advantage in dealing with his former colleagues. But it may be working against him. Senators don’t want clubby familiarity from a president. They want a president to shine the national spotlight on them. Some senators get so whacky in the national spotlight that they can’t function without it. Trump had that effect on Republicans. Before Trump, Lindsey Graham was almost a normal human being. Then Trump directed a huge amp of national attention Graham’s way, transmogrifying the senator into a bizarro creature who’d say anything Trump wanted to keep the attention coming. Not all senators are egomaniacs, of course. Most lie on an ego spectrum ranging from mildly inflated to pathological. Manchin and Sinema are near the extreme. Once they got a taste of the national spotlight, they couldn’t let go. They must have figured that the only way they could keep the spotlight focused on themselves was by threatening to do what they finally did last week: shafting American democracy.

1/23/2022,"When animal rights activist Matt Johnson last made national news, he was in disguise. He appeared on Fox Business in December 2020, sporting a buzz cut and button-down (much different to his usual casual attire) and posed as the CEO of Smithfield Foods. The pork giant he claimed to be representing had factory farms that were “petri dishes for new diseases”, he told the news anchor. After the segment went viral online, Fox realized their mistake: “It appears we have been punked,” host Maria Bartiromo announced, apologizing to Smithfield, which called the interview “a complete hoax”.  Johnson’s antics, and his seeming lack of fear of the consequences, have made him a formidable opponent of the meat industry. But while the Fox incident offered a moment of levity, today, Johnson makes the news for something far more serious. He has just been let off for criminal charges that could have sent him to prison for up to eight years. After conducting an undercover exposé of conditions at the pork company Iowa Select Farms in May 2020, his actions put him on the line for burglary and planting recording devices. Another charge, for trespassing at a food operation (an offense created by an Iowa ag-gag law), was added in 2021. While these specific charges against Johnson can’t be brought again, they may not be his last. His work as an organizer with the animal rights group Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) involves high-profile, high-risk actions like secretly recording factory farms and rescuing animals. Since farm animals are legally property and have no rights and almost no protection from suffering, removing them is usually treated as burglary, no different from stealing jewelry or someone’s wallet. In the last decade, many state “ag-gag” laws have sought to further criminalize such activism. The conditions that brought Johnson, an Iowa native now based in California, to Iowa Select Farms facilities were particularly cruel, according to DxE – and the outrage that followed his exposé suggests the public were similarly alarmed. As Covid was tearing through US slaughterhouses, Johnson had been tipped off by an Iowa Select truck driver about conditions at the company’s facilities. Across the meat industry, workers were falling ill, meatpacking capacity was significantly reduced, and farms were overloaded with animals and looking for ways to dispose of them. Johnson was made aware of a practice called “ventilation shutdown”, being used by Iowa Select to mass exterminate pigs: the animals were packed into sealed barns and essentially cooked to death by heaters and steam generators. In undercover footage captured by Johnson in May 2020, which was published by The Intercept, the pigs can be heard shrieking in distress. These revelations immediately made headlines and sparked a PR crisis for Iowa Select, which stopped practicing ventilation shutdown after it was brought to light – a rare and solid win for animal rights activists. “Matt’s investigation of ventilation shutdown is probably the most important [factory farm] investigation in more than a decade,” explains Justin Marceau, an animal law scholar and professor at the University of Denver. Prosecutions of activists such as Johnson have been on the rise in recent years. Last month, Wayne Hsiung, the DxE co-founder who for years has had criminal charges against him pending across multiple states, was convicted for the first time of two felonies in North Carolina for removing a sick goat from a farm. But on Wednesday, the day before Johnson’s trial, all charges against him were dismissed, an outcome that surprised reporters and activists alike. An earlier set of charges pertaining to Johnson’s ventilation shutdown investigation in Iowa had already been dismissed in January 2021, a few days before trial, because Iowa Select Farms didn’t want to testify. The charges dismissed this week, which included Johnson’s rescue of a sick two-week-old piglet whom he named Gilly, was the second case involving his activity at Iowa Select facilities. The case’s prosecutor, Joe Corrow, Wright county assistant attorney, on Tuesday filed to dismiss the charges “in the interest of justice”, a vague legal phrase that doesn’t provide much insight into his reasoning. “It’s basically a catch-all to say ‘Yeah, we don’t think we should go forward anymore’,” said Adam Junaid, one of Johnson’s attorneys. The motion to dismiss came 15 minutes before a hearing on news media recording of the trial, which is usually permitted in Iowa, was supposed to begin. Neither Corrow nor Iowa Select Farms responded to multiple requests for comment for this story. Johnson’s was one of the most highly anticipated farm animal rights cases in recent history, and the outcome is undoubtedly a victory for DxE, a group that since 2013 has been taking animals from factory farms and daring law enforcement to come after them – a practice they call “open rescue”. That has sparked debate over whether activists have the “right to rescue” animals from suffering. “We are setting a precedent that rescuing animals from situations where they’re in distress is the right thing to do. It’s not a crime,” said Johnson, speaking after the charges were dismissed. But Johnson had hoped to make it to trial. Some might question the wisdom of inviting criminal convictions, but for DxE, breaking laws in order to change them is part of the point. “I think when people see activist repression, it’s actually very positive for movements because you get that sympathy, you get that attention, and people see you as someone who’s suffering unjustly,” said DxE lead organizer Almira Tanner. “And then of course there’s the opportunities for concrete legal victories.” Marceau, the animal law scholar, believes there’s value in pushing unjust animal treatment laws to trial. If a jury votes to acquit in such a case, he said, that would be a bad outcome from the state’s perspective – making prosecutors reluctant to bring similar cases to trial, and opening up space for activists to do more rescues. But it’s a high-risk strategy. “Prison is terrible,” Marceau said. Alongside the personal suffering, he wonders whether the incarceration of prominent activists such as Johnson could damage the morale of the movement. Even if an activist has a sympathetic case, the jury aren’t certain to hear it. At Hsiung’s North Carolina trial, for example, the judge blocked most testimony on the health and suffering of the goat he had rescued. In Johnson’s case, the state had filed a motion arguing that showing ventilation shutdown would “appeal to the jury’s sympathies and arouse their sense of horror, and only serve to confuse the issues”. Johnson did not want his case to be dropped. He had hoped to use the trial to try to convince a jury that he was right to expose Iowa Select’s atrocities, create a precedent for the right to rescue suffering animals, and challenge the constitutionality of the ag-gag law he was charged under. Even a guilty verdict, he said, would help the movement. “I’m very at peace with the fact that sacrifice of this sort is going to be necessary,” he said before charges were dropped. He’d spent the last few weeks with his family in Iowa, preparing for the possibility of going to prison. “Not really,” Johnson said when asked if he was relieved that he wouldn’t be locked up after the prosecutor moved to dismiss the case. His legal team then filed an objection to the dismissal, arguing that Johnson should be able to address the allegations against him and “to have the ‘right to rescue’ tested in a court of law”. At a final hearing Wednesday, the judge seemed confused that Johnson was fighting for the right to risk prison. “The court cannot force the state to go to trial,” he concluded, before dismissing the case.",News/World news,An animal rights activist was in court on criminal charges.

1/23/2022,"The words “garden village” give rise in me to feelings of helplessness and despair. This was certainly the case after reading the article “Uproar in the garden of England as homes plan swallows up villages” (News). Stuck on to the south of Carlisle, a so-called garden village comprising 10,000 houses will be built in the near future. The destruction of agricultural land, woodland areas and other aspects of the rural Cumbrian landscape is apparently of no importance. Also of little importance appears to be the fact that within Carlisle there are 1,000 empty houses. In the nearby market town of Wigton, more than 100 empty houses are quietly mouldering. If this is the situation in Cumbria, it is probably the same dismal picture all over the UK – decaying empty buildings and brownfield sites put to no good use.  Many years ago, I lived in Kent. As a schoolgirl, I and a close friend spent happy hours cycling in the countryside, and one of our favourite haunts was a steep hill near Westerham.

No… figures show divide is widening”, News). Economists and politicians have enough evidence to show how good public investment in transport, education, healthcare, green spaces etc makes areas more desirable for homes and businesses to locate, pushing up land values. Given that taxpayers from all over the UK pay for public investments, why don’t taxpayers all over the UK share equally in the economic benefits such investments bring about? If our distorted and unfair tax system were changed to one based on returning all land and other natural resource wealth to the public purse, then we could have equality and fairness in society and a sustainable source of funding for maintaining and developing our public services and an economy that makes us use our land and other natural resources sparingly helping provide a clean environment to all.Heather WetzelHanworth, London The inspiration for the Red House in Dorset is not CFA Voysey or Louis Kahn, it is Bayko, the British construction toy popular in the 1940s and 50s (Architecture, the New Review).

The Swiss Criminal Code allows a “departure from the rules governing the execution of sentences in the favour of an inmate in the event of pregnancy”. Swedish law allows sentence postponement when a female inmate is pregnant, the duration of which is determined by what is considered to be reasonable. Even in China, the law allows for a woman sentenced to imprisonment to temporarily serve her sentence outside prison while pregnant. Prison is not, and will never be, a safe place for pregnant women. Inmate healthcare is evidently a grey area in UK legislation and when the NHS, responsible for the provision of healthcare in detained settings, last published a report summarising strategic directives for improving healthcare in the justice system, pregnancy was not even mentioned.Emilie McRaeTrowbridge, Wiltshire Where will it all end – do we have to remove Picasso’s work from public view because he was a deeply unpleasant man (“Sometimes a statue is indefensible – the BBC should get rid of Eric Gill”, Comment)?

According to the Scotch Whisky Association, Scotch accounted for 75% of Scotland’s (and 21% of the UK’s) food and drink exports in 2021, even if a combination of Brexit and (now rescinded) US tariffs have seen it lose more than £1bn worth of exports since 2019 (taking the figure for 2021 down to £3.8bn from £4.9bn in 2019). Still, the dominance of whisky does rather invite the question that a (Scottish) friend of mine asked me after my last whisky-monopolised contribution to the pre-Burns Night drinks column genre: don’t the Scots have any other drinks to offer? A question that he followed up the next time I saw him with a glass of G&T using Edinburgh’s gloriously pure, critussy Lime & Lind gin as a base. Swannay Brewery Orkney Porter (£3.70, swannaybrewery.com) My friend’s liquid punchline was only slightly undermined by the fact Lime & Lind is part of an exciting ongoing project helping to revive Edinburgh’s whisky heritage which includes the construction of a striking multi-storey (“vertical”) distillery on the waterfront in Leith, and which is due to finally open after a series of logistical and Covid-inspired delays, sometime over the summer. Scotland has more than its fair share of other genuinely distinctive, high-quality gins, from the enormously successful original Scottish craft gin Hendrick’s produced in Ayrshire (£29, 70cl, Tesco) to the brisk, crisply herbal-aromatic, subtly Sugar Kelp-infused, Isle of Harris Gin (£40, 70cl, harrisdistillery.com). And although I don’t think the location of a brewery is anything like as important in shaping a beer’s flavour as the location of a vineyard is in shaping a wine’s (or a distillery is for whisky or gin for that matter), Scottish craft-brewing does seem to me particularly creative. It’s certainly responsible for a high proportion of my favourite beers, such as Swannay Brewery’s darkly alluring, 9% abv classic Orkney Porter.  M&S 12 Year Old Highland Single Malt Scotch Whisky (from £31.50, Marks & Spencer, ocado.com) Beer has an obvious affinity with whisky, with that key trio of ingredients: water, barley and yeast. And some of the best and most distinctive Scottish beers make the most of this connection, using used Scotch whisky barrels to impart a little whisky-like rounded complexity and flavour. First brewed in 2003, Innis & Gunn’s The Original (£2, Morrisons), a golden ale made with three different malts that is aged in single malt whisky casks, is wonderfully suave, creamy, and laced with vanilla but brightly refreshing, too, an 6.6% abv brew that would work superbly with a scallops first course at any Burn’s Feast. For the haggis, meanwhile, I might switch to the richer, darker, roasted mocha intensity of Harviestoun’s 8% abv Ola Dubh 12 Year Old Whisky Aged (£4, 33cl, as part of a case of three bottles, harviestoun.com), before finishing off with at least one dram of whisky: M&S’s superb value, silky Highland bottling, perhaps, or a full peaty-smoky hit of Islay’s Bruichladdich Port Charlotte 10 Year Old Whisky (£52, Waitrose).

1/23/2022,"Bayside Social, 1 Beach Parade, Worthing BN11 2FG (01903 867050; baysidesocial.co.uk). Small plates £4-£13, desserts £7-£8, wines from £21 English seaside towns off-season are often said to be romantic places of sweet desolation and benign neglect. There is nothing romantic about Worthing today. Instead, my relationship with the town feels hotly dysfunctional, like it’s strapped me to the wall bars and is calling me filthy names. A wolf of a gale attempts to strip the clothes off my back, the rain slaps me about the chops and, beyond the beach, an angry sea seems to merge with a sky the colour of the bags beneath my eyes after too many late nights. I came to Worthing for lunch; instead, I am now seeking refuge.  I find it courtesy of a handsome wood and glass pavilion with the kind of sturdy bifold doors that the middle classes perv over when they’re getting their kitchens done. I know this because I am that perv. I’ve got those doors. The restaurant is tucked in among sharp new apartment blocks and looks out defiantly at the wind-blasted Channel. Once in here we feel as if we have become spectators on the elements, rather than its victims. It is a good place to be. Bayside Social is the second restaurant from 2018 amateur MasterChef winner Kenny Tutt, a former banker who ran away to join the circus. He has clearly decided just one ring won’t do. The online menu at his first place, Pitch, located further into his home town, is a grown-up affair offering confited salmon with aerated hollandaise for £10 and local venison with pommes Anna for £22. It is clearly a serious restaurant; the sort an amateur changing career to become a professional uses to make a statement of intent. This new venture, which opened last September, is the confident, relaxed second child of a team that now knows what it’s doing. This sort of multifunctional operation, which has to be many things to many people at many different times of day, is harder to pull off than a traditional restaurant. It’s all about flexibility. Ahead of my visit, for example, I become mildly obsessed with browsing the breakfast menu: the shakshuka baked eggs for £8, the full English with its “old English breed” sausages, the three ways with eggs benedict and the option to add Ramsay black pudding or “homestyle” potatoes. I probably would add potatoes to my breakfast. That feels like me. The general all-day menu is a modish parade of small plates priced at between £6 and £8. Only the few dishes involving showy ingredients, like scallops and beef, nudge into double figures. Outside the weather is a cacophony of blues and gunmetal greys; inside it is all riotous colour and wake-me-up flavours. The menu is pleasingly fish-heavy, as it should be this close to the sea. After all, if the doors were open you could lob a Riedel glass from your table and get it in the surf. A greaseless stack of white fish tempura, so vaguely named because the fish involved might change depending on the available catch, is today made with haddock. It’s bound in a bright yellow lacy batter. On the side is a cheerfully rough and ready tartare, which is exceptionally light on binding mayonnaise and big on all the chopped gherkins and capers. The fish cookery, as with almost everything we try, is on point. Slabs of salty smoked haddock arrive on a foamy hollandaise, and glazed with a toasted layer of tart cheddar. It is lunchtime, but it feels like the table has been invaded by a moment from an old-fashioned high tea. Then we’re off to the northern shores of the Med, courtesy of a piece of hake, the skin crisply roasted, the flesh pearly white, laid across a heap of a white bean cassoulet with salty nuggets of chorizo. There is a bowl of fat king prawns, so fresh they squeak a little beneath the teeth, in a steamy lake of garlic butter spiked with Aleppo chilli. On the side there is a hard crusted piece of olive-studded focaccia, which softens quickly in the deep swamp of melted dairy. They make their own sausages here. The cumin-spiked lamb merguez have a dense, sticky quality, and come on a mess of stewed chickpeas dressed with the ludicrously vivid pink of quick pickled onion ribbons. A small dollop of labneh, or strained yoghurt, helps lubricate everything. It is early in January and pigs in blankets are still on the menu. I order them out of some misplaced wistfulness. They come with an overly sweet Cumberland sauce that, in the oven heat, has started to set and attempts to glue my teeth together. I know I will be picking bits of this out of my molars all the way up the train line home. It really is the only thing I can find to quibble over. No worries. There is a plate of their crunchy and vivid long-stem broccoli in a miso dressing. This has the double benefit of making you feel like you are a good person who believes in the way of the vegetable, while also dislodging lumps of a cumberland sauce which has gone far beyond soft ball stage, and is now auditioning for a role as a denture adhesive. Florets of caramelised cauliflower rest on a thick purée of darkly roasted onion. Given my whine about the cumberland sauce, it is obtuse of me to complain now that the pear tarte tatin is a little light on caramel stickiness, but only people who are desperate to please, cleave to notions of consistency. I won’t ever be one of those. I am however very taken by a Black Forest Eton mess, the bright purple cream given acidic vigour from black cherry. It is big on meringue and there are squares of a cherry kirsch jelly. After all that has gone before we do not need to finish it. We finish it. At the end there is a deep, dark-roasted espresso with none of the acidic notes the young people seem to like these days. God is in the detail and the detail has been fully attended to. Looking about the room I can suddenly see how it will be in summer: all those doors thrown open to let in the light sea breezes and the breath of saline. It will be a place of louche afternoons and sunshine. For now, though, the afternoon light is draining away and the wind is still cracking its cheeks. We must step outside. To be honest, I’d much rather stay in here and just start all over again. Chef Nathan Outlaw, who closed his flagship restaurant at the height of the pandemic and opened the more casual Outlaw’s New Road in Cornwall’s Port Isaac, is expanding. He and his wife Rachel have bought the Stargazy Inn, a well-known pub with rooms boasting great views out over the coast, also in Port Isaac. ‘I’ve been gazing at the property from our restaurant Outlaw’s New Road, just a stone’s throw away, dreaming that one day we could get our hands on this property,’ Outlaw told Cornwall Live. ‘And now we have the keys.’ At outlaws.co.uk. In other expansion news, KFC has announced plans to open 500 new restaurants across the UK, a massive expansion from its existing 900 outlets. A lot of the growth will, they say, be through the opening of drive-throughs. Because what this country really needs now is more fried chicken. A grateful nation rejoices. Visit kfc.co.uk.

1/23/2022,"The question I had a very intense two-year affair with someone who, like me, had long been married. Eighteen months in, I left my wife, feeling sure my affair partner was the love of my life, and in the hope it might lead to us being together. This led to the loss of my home and much of my social network, and the need to change jobs. My affair partner decided to stay in her marriage, citing the wellbeing of her children. She wanted to keep the relationship with me going indefinitely in secret. This rapidly became unbearable to me and I have now cut off all contact, which was not her wish. She was evasive about whether she intended, or even wanted, to leave her marriage and be with me openly. Her final message to me expressed that this was now her intention, but that she could give no sense of a timescale.  I have told my wife absolutely everything and she has been phenomenally sane. She is offering to have me home, for a trial period, with a view to mutual kindness, leading to either reconciliation or a better parting. There was much of value in our shared life. I know that the rational thing to do is to assume my affair partner will never be able to be with me, but I still love her and think of her with hope. I have never felt the way I feel when in her presence with anyone else. Every day, a part of me wants to reach out and tell her this, for the millionth time, to try to win her. I obsess about it. Another part of me wants to have no contact. My life is stuck. Philippa’s answer “I wouldn’t want to belong to a club that would have me as a member,” said Groucho Marx. What is the pull of a potential partner who is not committing to you? What is this about? Did you have to work hard to get the approval of a parent? Did a teacher you had a crush on withhold praise? Have you had a pattern of falling for unavailable lovers, those who lived abroad, or were already married? I want you to think about your longing. At the moment, you are your longing, your longing is you, you are it. Take a step back from it. Look at it in a detached way. You’ve told me: “In my whole life, I have never felt the way I feel when in her presence.” And I’m tempted to prompt: “What about your mother when you were two?” Now this might sound far-fetched, but look at the way a toddler wants their parent. Notice the clinging, the desperation, the longing: it’s all there. I’m guessing you may be haunted by an inner ghost of that baby or toddler who longed and longed and sometimes had the ecstasy of being momentarily held, in an intermittent way that reinforced the longing and made you long all the more. The trouble with what is familiar in this way is that it feels right. Sometimes people say love feels like “coming home”, like coming back to what is familiar, from a time even before words could explain that familiarity. You learned how to long – like a sort of default mood for you – before you knew any words. The love you have with your lover sounds like a “falling in love” type of love. The type we see in films where you are swept up in a passive way: it happens to you. Very much, really, like it happens to a baby or a toddler, they don’t do anything, they fall into longing. But the love your wife is showing you? Wow! That is a different sort of love altogether. That isn’t passive, that is love as a verb, that is love as an action, that is the sort of steady, committed, available, consistent kindness that, had you experienced it as a toddler, I don’t think you’d be in this situation now. That is probably the love you need, rather than the one you think you want. What would I advise you to do? Go home and develop the appreciation for your available (at least for the moment; she probably has her limits) kind wife into something deeper. Not the heady obsessional, no-one-has-had-a-love-like-ours craziness that you had for your lover, not that raging sea, but a steady lake than runs deeper than you could have ever imagined. And that old, old scar that your lover picked into a scab will heal and – more than heal – will become memory upon memory of love in action, rather than love that falls down a familiar hole again. Don’t fall into the longing-trap, be loving. It’s better, far better in the long run and leads to something more sustainable. Short answer: be interested, not in your lover, but in the way you long for someone who won’t prioritise you. Find out about that part of you. Find a narrative for how that part came into being. Second, appreciate what you do have. If what I’ve said has any resonance for you, follow it up. If it all seems like double-Dutch, don’t worry, keep seeking help until you find what you need.

1/23/2022,"For the last nine years, Sam Quinones has been studying the changing face of drug use, sales, and addiction in the United States. In his new book The Least of Us: True Tales of America and Hope in the Time of Fentanyl and Meth, he tracks the explosion of synthetic drugs that has hit the streets of America, increasing the danger of drug use and making addictive chemical substances far cheaper and more plentiful than ever before.  He finds that the days when drug production required land and agriculture are gone. Now drugs are being manufactured from toxic chemicals in vast quantities by Mexican traffickers and introduced to users by slipping them into the supply of other substances, like heroin and cocaine. The Guardian spoke with Quinones about the origins and dangers of synthetic drugs and his theories about the intersection between drug use and homelessness. The conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. In your 2015 book, Dreamland, you explored how the opioid addiction crisis took hold in the small towns of America, through pain pills marketed by drug companies and over-prescribed by doctors. How have opioids changed since then? The opioid epidemic is probably a misnomer by now. It’s actually an epidemic of addiction. The supply is no longer coming from doctors as much. Now you are finding the drugs that the Mexican trafficking world produces – primarily fentanyl and methamphetamines – everywhere. And that is due to the switch traffickers have made towards synthetic drugs. These drugs do not require a plant to produce – just chemicals. These are extraordinarily dangerous drugs. Fentanyl is the deadliest drug we’ve ever known on the streets. And meth has the capabilities of truly turning people mentally ill. These drugs are now all over the country and cheaper and more prevalent than ever before. How does fentanyl fit into the record number of overdoses we’re seeing in the US? Fentanyl is responsible for over 70% of overdoses in the US. The thing about fentanyl, which is very appealing to the drug trafficking world, is that it is so potent. A very small amount will make you a lot of money. One kilo of fentanyl can be cut and turned into 50 kilos of saleable product on the street. But, because it’s so potent, it also can kill people very, very quickly. A few small specks, similar to a few grains of salt, can make you high and a little bit more than that will kill you. A fentanyl high lasts for a short period of time compared to heroin. So people who are addicted have to use it several times a day. And every time they use, they run the risk of getting a mix far, far more potent than they can handle. Which means you’re essentially playing Russian roulette several times a day. How did we end up with so much fentanyl being sold on the streets? Traffickers are making a drug that they never even knew about 15 years ago. When it first arrived in the US, it was coming in the mail from chemical companies in China. They were making it and sending it to buyers who ordered it on the internet. That has ended because China put in place regulations allowing only a few companies to make fentanyl. But companies still make the ingredients for fentanyl and they ship those to Mexico, where traffickers have figured out how to make fentanyl. They have been shipping it up here in quantities that boggle the mind. How did this get to drug users? Were they seeking fentanyl? At first, it was mixed into heroin. They called it heroin, but increasingly it was almost all fentanyl. In later years, street-level dealers began mixing fentanyl into cocaine and methamphetamine as well. It’s a market expansion tool. When you put fentanyl into cocaine, in fairly short order that user will become a fentanyl addict. That addict has to use every day to keep the dope sickness and withdrawals away. Whereas a cocaine user would buy from you every few days or every weekend, this customer has to buy from you every single day. But, of course, you run the risk of killing some of your customers by doing that, because they don’t have tolerances that prepare them for fentanyl. Your book also looked at some devastating changes in the way methamphetamine is being manufactured. Tell me about that. For a lot of years methamphetamine was made with a chemical called ephedrine. Ephedrine is a decongestant found in Sudafed pills. It comes from the ephedra plant. The Mexican drug trafficking world industrialized that process and made methamphetimines with it through the 90s and the 2000s. That drug created a very euphoric feeling; it was a party drug. Finally, in 2008, the Mexican government said only a few companies can possess ephedra and significantly reduced the amount of importation of the chemical. Once the government did that, the trafficking world in Mexico had to find a new way to produce meth. And they found a different way. There are a lot of chemicals. It stinks. It’s complicated. It has one benefit over ephedrine and that is that you can make the precursor many different ways with lots of different legal, industrial, toxic chemicals. The name of this precursor is phenyl-2-propanone, which is commonly known as P2P. With this new method, the government can really never crack down on your meth production the way they did with ephedrine. There are dozens of ways of making it, apparently. What sorts of chemicals are they using? All sorts of industrial, toxic chemicals, like lye and hydrochloric acid. There’s a long, long list of things that can be used. But none of these are chemicals you want to put into your body. They’re used for tanning, perfumes, racing fuels. How did this new formulation of meth change the effects of the drug? First of all, the reformulation allows the mass distribution of methamphetamine unlike we’ve ever seen before. So it’s now all across the country, from LA to Vermont, including regions like New England where it never existed really before in large quantities. Along the way though, what I found is that it is accompanied by rapid onset of severe symptoms of schizophrenia, particularly hallucinations. There is incoherent babbling. There’s an extraordinary degree of paranoia. It’s very intense, so you think everybody’s out to get you. No longer is it a party drug. It’s more of a sinister drug, where you kind of turn inward. How does that affect people’s lives? You believe this changed version of meth is connected to homelessness, right? What happens is people very quickly become homeless. As this form of meth has marched across the country, we have also seen an enormous increase in mental illness and in homelessness, particularly the encampments that we now have in so many towns across the country. I believe the tent encampments are connected intimately with this kind of methamphetamine. Certainly nobody on this form of meth wants to be in a homeless shelter. Because they’re kind of paranoid and scared of everybody. And so people feel a tent is a little pod where you can be alone away from this nasty world. And I believe it’s all connected. Have other experts confirmed this? There have been no neuroscientific studies on this. So what exactly is happening? I don’t know. Is it because the meth has some new formulation or some new kind of chemical in it? Or, on the other hand, is it simply the fact that it’s so much more potent and so cheap and people are using lots of it? I don’t know. What I’m giving you is the street reporting, from talking to people who have worked in this world most of their professional lives, people who have been addicted to it and people now in recovery. Can you tell me about Eric Barrera, the former meth addict you met who first highlighted these changes for you? He had been using methamphetamines since the early 2000s, when Mexican traffickers were almost entirely producing meth using ephedrine. He said he would party all night long and would want to jabber away with everyone. Then, he said, in 2009, everything changed. There was no more of that party euphoria. One night he used methamphetamines and he became scarily paranoid. At his girlfriend’s house, he began stabbing the walls with a butcher knife thinking she was keeping a man inside the walls. He then very quickly became homeless. Up to that point, he had held a job, he had a car and an apartment. Then all of a sudden everything just kind of disintegrates and he ends up on the street. When I met him, he had been sober for years and was a homeless outreach coordinator for vets. He said, “I don’t know what’s causing this, but I can tell you that every encampment I go through, I see people in the same condition of mental degradation that I went through.” 2009 is exactly the year when the Mexican trafficking world began to switch away from ephedrine meth and toward P2P meth. So I began asking people who worked in the world of methamphetamines what they were seeing. The story is always the same. This stuff arrives and, very quickly, people begin to lose all bearings and the homeless population expands. Have you gotten any pushback on this theory from those who work with the homeless? Sure. People want to blame high housing costs for homelessness. They feel that, if you say drugs are the reason for homelessness, then that stigmatizes people who are homeless. I’m not sure I buy that at all. But I found the increases in homelessness happening in areas where housing costs are very high, like Los Angeles, but also in areas where there are no rising costs and where they’ve never had any homelessness, like, for example, the town of Clarksburg, West Virginia.

1/23/2022,"Are there no tactics to which a disgraced and unpopular prime minister will not sink in his desperate attempt to cling on against the odds? For Boris Johnson, it would seem not. In the last week, there have been further revelations about the underhand tactics his whips have deployed to keep MPs loyal: threats of placing hostile stories about their private lives in the press or of withdrawing planned funding to the detriment of their constituents. Meanwhile, the government has pushed out story after story to try to distract from critical headlines; policymaking has become no more than an instrument to try to save Johnson’s skin, regardless of the consequences. Just over a decade ago, the parliamentary expenses scandal exposed the gulf between what MPs thought was acceptable and what the public was willing to accept. Too many parliamentarians saw the manipulation of expenses loopholes as compensation for their public office; voters saw it as greed and corruption. The row that has erupted over the parliamentary whipping exposes a similar dynamic. Allies of the prime minister and Westminster stalwarts argue putting pressure on MPs to express support or vote with the government is just part of the rough and tumble of politics. But voters quite rightly do not expect a government to extract loyalty from its backbenchers by threatening constituency funding or warning that if they rebel there will be nasty stories in the press.  Christian Wakeford, the Conservative MP for Bury South who defected to Labour last week, claimed he was threatened with the withdrawal of funding for a new school in his constituency if he did not vote with the government against summer holiday meals for pupils from low-income families. The Conservative backbencher William Wragg has revealed that colleagues have come to him reporting that the whips had attempted to blackmail them into continuing to support Johnson; he will be meeting the Metropolitan police to discuss these allegations. Chris Bryant, the Labour chair of the Commons standards committee, says he has heard MPs alleging that Johnson himself has been involved in this blackmail. At best, this is political corruption, at worst, criminal conduct. There urgently needs to be an independent inquiry into these allegations. But such an endeavour is vanishingly unlikely from a government whose main focus at the moment is avoiding accountability for the culture of boozy parties that has ended up with the prime minister himself being accused of breaking lockdown laws and of misleading parliament. Everything Johnson and his government are now doing is driven by panic and narrow political interests. Nothing is sacred, everything is fair game. The distraction techniques over the last week, dubbed by his allies as “Operation Red Meat”, have involved the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, launching a politically motivated attack on the BBC, unilaterally announcing a two-year funding freeze and implying that the licence fee would be abolished altogether in 2027, from which she later rowed back. The BBC is a vital national institution that has already made significant cutbacks; it cannot afford a funding cut. The home secretary, Priti Patel, has announced that the armed forces would take charge of operations to limit the number of asylum seekers trying to cross the Channel, in a move the defence select committee chair has described as “rushed” and a massive distraction for the armed forces. Yet another country – this time Ghana – has been forced to call out the government’s false claims that it is in talks with it to process migrants offshore, a move that would anyway probably contradict international law. Meanwhile, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, aimed for the front pages with his announcement he would be clamping down on excess train announcements, to the bewilderment of people affected by far more pressing transport issues across the country. The longer this corrupt and hypocritical government limps on, the greater the risk it does long-term damage to public trust in the institutions of democracy. How can citizens trust a government to act in their interest while it wheels out ludicrous announcements that serve no purpose other than attempting to bolster a prime minister mired in crisis after crisis? Nowhere is this true more than with Covid. During an ongoing national emergency, it is critical the public trusts the government to take decisions for the right reasons, based on evidence rather than its desire to capture the news cycle. It is extremely good news that Omicron infection rates are falling. But is the government dropping plan B measures – including the compulsory wearing of masks – this week because the data indicates this is appropriate or for the purposes of generating a feelgood news story? The cynicism Johnson is embedding in the electorate will not evaporate with the end of his premiership. Johnson may last another month; he may last another year. But he is prime minister of this country in name alone: despite winning a large majority just two years ago, his authority has leached away entirely as a result of his incompetence and lack of integrity. The longer the Conservative party props him up, the more he undermines the notion of standards in public life.",Opinion/Opinion,The Observer view on the use of dirty tactics to bolster Boris Johnson | Observer editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/23/observer-view-on-dirty-tactics-to-bolster-boris-johnson
1/23/2022,"New South Wales and Victoria have announced near-identical plans to slow the spread of Covid as students return to classrooms next week with both states relying on rapid antigen tests (RATs) in the first month. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, and the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, outlined their state plans on Sunday acknowledging they had collaborated so the two biggest jurisdictions were in sync.  The leaders agreed that getting students back into the classroom after two years of disrupted learning was a priority despite the Omicron wave sweeping across Australia. Perrottet said that some students had spent a quarter of their schooling at home. “What is most important about this approach is that it allows students to enjoy all aspects of their schooling in a safe and sensible way,” he said. Here we outline how the NSW and Victoria plans are similar, where they differ, and what we are still waiting to learn. Twice-weekly testing with RATs Both states will provide staff and students with enough rapid antigen tests to facilitate twice-weekly surveillance testing during the first four weeks of term one. In NSW, Perrottet announced the state government would provide more than 12m RATs to over 3,150 government and non-government schools and also early childhood centre staff. Schools should receive the first 6m tests by Wednesday ready to be distributed to parents. In Victoria, Andrews said a total 14m RATs would be delivered across the coming weeks. He said 6.6m tests will be at school by the time classes start back next week. In contrast to NSW, Andrews said that there will also be enough RATs to allow students and staff at specialist schools to test for the virus every day to better protect medically vulnerable children against severe illness. Andrews warned that there will be cases in schools but he said surveillance testing was about “finding as many cases as we can and shutting down those chains of transmission”. “We have to get schools back. Once they get back, given how much Omicron is in the community, there will be cases,” the Victorian premier said. No contact tracing Schools will no longer close in NSW or Victoria if a student tests positive for the virus – and there will be no contact tracing for students or staff. The Victorian deputy premier, James Merlino, told reporters “the approach in schools and kindergartens will be in line with any communicable disease” – a sentiment echoed by his NSW counterparts. Parents of children who test positive for Covid in NSW or Victoria will need to keep the child at home, let the school know, and report the case to their state health authority. It will then be up to schools to contact other parents to let them know there has been a positive case in the school community and to monitor their child for symptoms. In both NSW and Victoria anyone who tests positive to Covid must isolate for seven days. The NSW chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, appeared to step beyond her government’s official advice, warning parents not to send their symptomatic children to school even if they have tested negative for Covid-19 on a rapid antigen test. “Even if they have a negative test on the first day, please keep them home and do a repeat test. Only send them back if there is an alternate diagnosis,” she said on Sunday. School events Both states on Sunday suggested that school events like assemblies, sport and excursions will be allowed to go ahead with Covid-safe plans. Mandatory masks Masks will be mandatory for high school staff and students in both states. The two states differ, though, when it comes to masks in primary school. In Victoria, masks will also be mandatory for students in grade three and above and highly recommended for those in prep, grade one and grade two. In NSW masks will just be recommended for primary school students. Booster shots for teachers A third Covid vaccine dose will be compulsory for school staff in Victoria. Merlino announced on Sunday that Victorian school and early childhood staff will be required to get a booster shot by 25 February or within three months and two weeks of their second jab. Merlino said he thought the workforce would “enthusiastically respond” to the new mandate given that 99.7% of staff were double-vaccinated by the end of term four in 2021. In NSW, Perrottet said last week that state education department school-based staff would be required to have a booster shot. But a spokesperson for the education minister, Sarah Mitchell, told the Guardian on Sunday the government was still working with NSW Health to update the health orders. They noted staff would be given sufficient time to comply with the changes. Air purifiers and outdoor learning Both state governments are upping the number of air purifiers in schools. The NSW state government will distribute about 20,000 air purifiers to schools while Victoria is providing 51,000. Merlino said the Victorian government was focused on providing purifiers to high-risk settings with poor ventilation, like music rooms, staff rooms and indoor canteens. He didn’t shy away from flagging that “no other jurisdiction is rolling out our purifiers as we are here in Victoria”. Merlino said that some classes could be moved outdoors, especially during the warmer months. He said more than 1,800 schools applied for a government shade cloth grant, noting that construction had already begun at more than 300 schools. Staffing arrangements Both state governments flagged that staff shortages would be one of the biggest challenges when students returned to the classroom, as teachers test positive for the virus or need to stay home to care for cases or close contacts. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning State leaders said that, in addition to schools’ casual teaching workforces, they would draw upon retired teaching staff, final-year teaching students at university, departmental staff, and school principals and vice-principals to keep classrooms open. Merlino said that “remote learning is an absolute last resort” and classrooms would only close down due to staff shortages “for the shortest period of time [and] only localised to particular schools”. Will this be enough? The president of the NSW Teachers’ Association, Angelo Gavrielatos, said the state government should be doing more to protect staff as they returned to school. “With respect to rapid antigen testing, we support the use of those tests twice a week in what is described as a surveillance approach,” Gavrielatos said, but he questioned whether more RATs could be needed for additional testing each week. Gavrielatos also argued that the NSW government should make mask-wearing a requirement for anyone in schools in indoor settings. He said the teachers’ association would push for the provision of high-quality masks such as P2 masks. And he warned against forcing staff to return to work if they were close contacts. “Any suggestion that staff would be directed to return to work when they are close contacts is quite frankly beyond comprehension because all that will do is increase risk rather than mitigate against risk,” he said. “It is not practical because those staff that are close contacts … will invariably be caring for other members of their household. These are not practical [measures] and quite frankly not supported.” Both NSW and Victoria will allow teachers to attend school even if they are close contacts of a known case so long as they produce a daily negative RAT. What are other states doing? We are yet to hear if other states are modifying their back-to-school plans in light of the Omicron variant and high rates of community transmission. The Queensland health minister, Yvette D’Ath, on Sunday ruled out rapid antigen testing school students twice a week. Queensland has delayed term one by a fortnight. D’Ath said there was no national health advice for twice-weekly RATs and it was “not a comfortable test at the best of times”. Rapid test supplies were also in short supply in Queensland, the minister said. “We believe that those tests are best focused in the areas where we need them the most, such as ... being able to get hold of them for critical essential workers, aged care and health.”",News/Australia news,NSW and Victoria schools reopening plans focus on Covid surveillance testing but scrap contact tracing ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/23/nsw-and-victoria-school-reopening-plans-focus-on-covid-surveillance-testing-but-scrap-contact-tracing
1/23/2022,"In 19th century Macedonia, a witch roams the hills. She’s a ghoulish cautionary tale told to children, referred to as the wolf-eateress. But one day, to a new mother in an isolated house, she’s suddenly very real, hovering above the baby, thirsty for fresh blood. The woman pleads, begs for a deal. If the witch returns when her daughter is 16, she can take her then. The witch agrees but as a sign of their bargain cuts the baby’s tongue, rendering her incapable of speech.  It’s a bold, attention-securing first scene, writer-director Goran Stolevski taking one of many big swings in a one-of-a-kind debut, arresting not just because of its horrific act of violence against a baby (it is mercifully not explicit) but of its calm, matter-of-fact nature. In Stolevski’s vividly wrought world, the supernatural is an accepted part of life. It’s feared and demonised, yes, but whenever it crashes into scene, it’s not met with great shock, more an inevitable sigh. It comes for us all. The desperate mother feigns a loss, that the witch has taken her child, allowing her to hide the baby in a cave, a sacred place she believes will be safe. The child grows up feral, afraid but curious, until one day, the witch finds and takes her. She gives her the spit, which in the world of the film is a conversion, given just once in a witch’s lifetime, making the child immortal as well, able to switch bodies when she meets someone she wants to inhabit. And so begins a fascinating journey, a life in the bodies of others. There are vague shades of Jonathan Glazer’s Under the Skin and, in his less self-indulgent, less recent films, the work of Terrence Malick. But Stolevski’s film is confidently of his own creation. Most of the dialogue is Macedonian narration, the fractured speech of someone figuring out how to be, in awe of nature while weighed down by a mounting disappointment in humanity, in how women are manhandled and sexualised, a stranger able to look at how unjust such an accepted and normalised patriarchy might then seem. It’s a deft and thrilling conceit, experiencing the highs and lows of life through different people. Stolevski, in a film that feels less like a debut and more a late-stage magnum opus, has found an ingenious vessel to make profound observations on gender, sex and being. The bodies allow for an international cast – Swedish Noomi Rapace, Australian Alice Englert, Portugese Carloto Cotta and Macedonian Sara Klimoska – each sharing an ever-learning wonder and a physical awkwardness, an incredible feat of collective and consistent acting. Experiencing life as a man provides an illuminating lesson, his odd behaviour laughed off by others or blamed on the evils of women while sex is meant to be pleasurable and controlled. As a woman, life is based more on violence and subjugation and sex is to be tolerated (she’s told not to relish the act). But the film is not steeped in oppressive darkness, it’s a tale of growing strength and unwavering endurance and how to find joy in a life that many might tell you is without it. With just short films under his belt before this, Stolevski is operating at a higher, more assured level than most with a great deal more experience. As a director, he’s as thrilled by the specifics of nature and human interaction as his protagonist, picking out the curious small things and suddenly making them that feel that much bigger, cracking open this world for us all. As a writer, he’s capable of remarkable insight and empathy, shown most effectively in the late-stage reveal of a harrowing backstory for the wolf-eateress, a woman destroyed by male expectation and judgment. His film toys with fairy tale fantasy and gruesome body horror – there are plenty of torn innards on display – but he has ultimately created something indefinable, gloriously so, like nothing we’ve really ever seen before and like nothing we’re likely to see again.
