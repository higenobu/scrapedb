1/21/2022,"Britain’s wind and solar farms could help to reduce households’ energy bills by paying back almost £800m to consumers by the end of the winter after gas and electricity market prices rocketed above their set subsidy levels. Households earned a £157m windfall from renewable energy generators for the first time in the final quarter of last year following record high market prices, according to official figures.  The body responsible for managing renewable energy payments, the Low Carbon Contracts Company (LCCC), has forecast paybacks from the industry could increase to a total of £770m by the end of winter, shaving an average of £27 from the annual home energy bill. But customers might have been in line for multibillion pound paybacks worth about £140 for a typical annual energy bill if the UK’s renewable energy rollout had taken place sooner, according to the industry. The UK government is due to announce the results of its biggest every renewable energy subsidy auction this spring. This will support up to 12 gigawatts of clean energy capacity by allowing onshore wind and solar projects to compete for a subsidy for the first time since 2015. Renewable energy projects typically receive payments from household energy bills to top up the earnings from the energy market to an agreed level, or “strike price”, But in return they are expected to pay cash back to consumers when market prices outstrip the set subsidy level. This system helps to protect households from surging market prices, which are expected cause bills to soar from an average of £1,277 this winter to £1,925 from 1 April, while providing renewable energy investors with certainty too, the LCCC said. Based on the official figures from the last quarter, the UK’s pipeline of renewable energy projects, which are expected to be under construction until 2023, could have saved households £3.9bn if they were operating this winter, according to analysis by SSE. The company claims that its Dogger Bank windfarm, under construction in the North Sea and featuring the world’s largest wind turbines, would have saved UK homes almost £1.9bn in total this winter, or the equivalent of more than £67 per household. The analysis does not include the savings from avoiding the use of gas power plants, which have become “eye-wateringly expensive” after record-high gas market prices, or the cost of integrating renewable energy into the UK’s electricity system. Dan McGrail, the chief executive of RenewableUK, an industry trade group, said: “The answer to an energy crisis caused by soaring gas prices is to encourage investment in low-cost renewables to decrease our reliance on eye-wateringly expensive fossil fuels.” “The escape route from volatile and uncontrollable gas prices couldn’t be clearer – investing in our green future secures low-cost reliable power as well as getting the UK to net zero as fast as possible,” he said. Alistair Phillips-Davies, the chief executive of SSE, added: “By building more of our own clean energy infrastructure here in Britain and, critically, investing strategically in the network infrastructure to connect it all, we can protect ourselves from the next energy crisis.”",News/Business,Paybacks from UK renewables could cut £27 from bills by end of winter,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/20/paybacks-from-uk-renewables-could-cut-pounds-27-from-bills-by-end-of-winter
1/21/2022,"Tory whips were accused on Thursday of using dirty tactics to intimidate rebels as Boris Johnson was said to be increasingly convinced he could see off a vote of no confidence. Though allies of Johnson believe a vote is almost inevitable after the inquiry into Downing Street parties is published next week, one cabinet minister said on Thursday there were now significant doubts among the rebels about whether they could defeat the prime minister.  The Guardian has been told of at least five MPs who have expressed concerns about the government threatening funding for their constituency or encouraging damaging stories to be published in newspapers. MPs said the tactic had been used not only during the so-called partygate scandal, but ahead of the votes on Uighur genocide, cutting international aid, free school meals and the rise in national insurance. A No 10 spokesperson said: “We are not aware of any evidence to support what are clearly serious allegations. If there is any evidence to support these claims we would look at it very carefully.” Johnson said he had “seen no evidence” of those threats. The row over whipping tactics came amid other developments as: A significant email from a senior official warning Martin Reynolds not to hold the summer party on 20 May has now been obtained by the inquiry by Sue Gray. Anger among Johnson critics escalated after sources briefed that rebels were losing their nerve. MPs denied that letters of no confidence had been withdrawn, calling it spin by Number 10. Leading Brexiter Steve Baker said it looked like “checkmate” for the prime minister. As allies of Johnson claimed the prime minister was being given a reprieve before the Gray report, senior Tory William Wragg, who chairs a government scrutiny committee, claimed there was attempted blackmail against some colleagues involving public money. He urged MPs to report government ministers, whips and advisers to the Speaker – and even the police. Two of the MPs, the Tory defector Wakeford and Andrew Bridgen, another Johnson critic, spoke publicly on Thursday about the tactics they claim had been deployed against them. Wakeford backed up the claims by Wragg that threats involving public money were made by the whips. “I was threatened that I would not get a school for Radcliffe if I did not vote in one particular way,” he said. “This is a town that has not had a high school for the best part of 10 years. “How would you feel when they hold back the regeneration of a town for a vote. It didn’t sit comfortably. That was the start of me questioning my place, where I was and ultimately to where I am now.” Wragg, who chairs the public administration and constitutional affairs committee (PACAC), which looks into the work of government and the civil service, said it would breach the ministerial code “in threatening to withdraw investment from members of parliaments’ constituencies which are funded from the public purse”. He said encouraging the publication of stories in newspapers would also be a breach. “The intimidation of a member of parliament is a serious matter,” he added. “Moreover, the reports of which I’m aware would seem to constitute blackmail. “As such it would be my general advice to colleagues to report these matters to the Speaker of the House of Commons and the commissioner of the Metropolitan police.” Bridgen, a Conservative backbencher who was among the first MPs to call for Johnson to go, said he believed a story in the Times on Monday detailing his links to a Ghana-based timber company had been inspired by No 10. “Not only am I confident that happened, but so are all my colleagues,” Bridgen, MP for North West Leicestershire since 2010, told the Guardian. “One of them told me, ‘It’s not even subtle nowadays.’” One former minister said he was incensed by the tactic of threatening to cut funding to seats. “It has unusually high leverage with our newer colleagues. We have young, new members with marginal seats in poor areas. “That’s precisely the area where the seat is dependent on allocations of money and the levelling up regime. The scope for this kind of threat is much more than it would have been. If you use this tactic all the red wall are susceptible to it.” The Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, said allegations about potentially criminal offences would be a matter for the police. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said the alleged threats to withdraw investment to force support for Johnson were “disgusting” and Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, said Johnson was “now in full scorched earth mode”. One cabinet minister said Johnson was increasingly confident that he could “probably win” in a vote of no confidence and called the whipping row “a sideshow.” He said colleagues were beginning to think it was “electoral suicide” to depose Johnson. “When you start to put it to people that the prime minister who got us this huge majority might have to go over cheese and wine – well it starts to look ridiculous.” But other MPs said Johnson was still in deep peril. “There are a lot of people who do not like these kinds of threats; they don’t like bullies,” one MP said. Another MP opposing Johnson denied that letters of no confidence had been withdrawn after Wakeford defected to Labour. “These briefings of withdrawals are pure invention from No 10,” one said. “Wakeford may have stayed some people’s hands yesterday but this isn’t going into reverse.” Johnson is understood to be keen for Gray’s report to be published by Tuesday, to allow him to make a statement before facing another PMQs on Wednesday. A significant email from a senior official warning Martin Reynolds not to hold the summer party on 20 May has now been obtained by Gray, first reported by ITV. Cabinet Office sources said she had already been given the authority to search email records – which are retained even from departing officials. A Whitehall source said Gray is nearing the end of her inquiry and publication next week was very likely. Baker, a key Westminster figure who often led rebellions including on Brexit and Covid, said he would not be organising against the prime minister but said he should resign if he broke the law or misled parliament. “I’m appalled we’ve reached this position,” he told the BBC’s Political Thinking podcast.“At the moment I’m afraid it does look like checkmate but whether he can save himself, we’ll see … I’m very clear that if he’s broken the law or lied at the dispatch box, then he must go. But one thing I would say I’m not going to organise against Boris Johnson, my heart wouldn’t be in it.”",News/Politics,Ministers accused of intimidating MPs who oppose Boris Johnson,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/20/boris-johnson-ministers-confidence-vote-whipping
1/21/2022,"Sally J Morgan has won the Portico prize for her debut novel, which was inspired by her experience of being offered a lift by the serial killers Fred and Rosemary West. Morgan’s Toto Among the Murderers, set in Leeds and Sheffield in the 1970s, follows the lives of Jude – known to her friends as Toto – and other women as violence moves closer, and the Wests stalk the country. It beat titles including Andrew O’Hagan’s Mayflies and Jenn Ashworth’s Ghosted to the £10,000 Portico prize, which goes to outstanding writing “that best evokes the spirit of the north of England”.  Chair of judges Gary Younge said that Toto Among the Murderers “vividly evokes a period in recent history with themes that carry clear, if painful echoes, to today – a time when women in the north, in particular, lived in mortal fear of sexual violence made explicit by daily headlines about mass murderers targeting vulnerable women”. Younge and his fellow judges were in “broad agreement” that it should take the award, he said. “What comes through is the determination of Toto, the main character, to refuse to allow fear to define her as she lives a life of reckless adventure, longing and love,” he said. Morgan has previously spoken about how an experience in her 20s, when she was offered a lift by the Wests, eventually resulted in the novel. “I needed a lift. They stopped and offered me one. But when I looked into Fred West’s eyes, his eyes were full of cruelty. It was like a physical assault that propelled me away from the car,” she wrote in the Guardian. “The sense of being someone’s prey has haunted me. So much so, that years after this encounter, I wrote a novel about trying to survive in a world of predators.” Morgan grew up in Yorkshire and now lives and works in Wellington, New Zealand. The north of England, she said after winning the Portico prize, holds “a big place” in her heart. “I love to write about place, and I wanted to write about a place and a time and stories that I felt were being neglected and in danger of being lost. So, to have [Toto Among the Murderers] recognised in this way is enormously affirming,” she said. The award was established in 1985 by The Portico Library in Manchester to “celebrate the strong regional and literary identity of the north” and raise awareness about its historical, cultural and literary heritage. Previous winners include Jessica Andrews, Benjamin Myers and Sarah Hall.",Arts/Books,Story inspired by near miss with Fred West wins the Portico prize,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/20/story-inspired-by-near-miss-with-fred-west-wins-the-portico-prize
1/21/2022,"If Paris fashion week can come with a festive gaudiness, the highly anticipated Louis Vuitton autumn-winter 2022 show – the last by its late artistic director, Virgil Abloh, who died in November, was delivered with a special serenity. A revamped 19th century industrial building once entered, gave way to a majestic sky blue decor which served as a reminder of the celestial quality of Abloh’s work.  Aptly named “Louis Dreamhouse”, the space had been described by Abloh (according to the encyclopaedic notes of the show), as “a spark of imagination that turns into an eternal flame”. The collection presented itself as a coming-of-age story, following, as the show notes point out, “the boyhood ideology, seeing the world through the unspoiled eyes of a child,” immersed in a dreamlike sound design crafted by Tyler, the Creator with arrangements by Arthur Verocai and performed by the Chineke! Orchestra. The show alternated models and dancers, intertwining fashion runway and performances. A meeting between artifacts and archetypes, the garments re-encoded the wardrobes that had become quintessential to Abloh’s creative vision – tailoring, sportswear, skirts, hacked as only he knew how: this included cartoon characters emerging on knitwear and hoodies, as well as a graphic play with the Louis Vuitton monogram, visibly questioning the place of the logo in society. The show made the most of the men’s suit, which appeared with extra wide shoulders, as if to question the superhuman and posthuman quality of the body; it came recomposed and revisited in a tapestry that skillfully mixed two opposite paintings, Gustave Courbet’s The Painter’s Studio, dating back to 1855, and Giorgio de Chirico’s Souvenir d’Italie from 1914. This, and the occasional cherub’s wings on a handful of models’ backs. Reflecting on issues of “originality, provenance, reference and self-reference,” Abloh also included a variety of dresses, full length ones with pleats and tulle, and even a bridal model, thus implicitly questioning the idea of gender – yet underscoring how much our binary view of the matter is anchored in western culture, by adding historically fluid caftans and djellabas. As for accessories, Abloh’s knack for masculine it-bags was apparent in a variety of designs including climbing bags and rubberized crocodile bags, some filled with leather cut out flowers and others adorned in sequins. All in all, they provided a sort of apotheosis of key leitmotifs of his previous work: mainly the hacking of masculine stereotypes and deconstructed cliches. All summed up in some of his most memorable quotes: “I’m not made for a podium but I’ll design a podium that ushers in systemic change,” he had once said.

1/21/2022,"“Lidl eat your heart out!” laughs a member of the Bread and Butter Thing, as he makes his way out down the path, a box of frozen steak and kidney pies balancing on his lap, and bulging carrier bags of vegetables and groceries tucked under the seat of his mobility scooter. He is not the first satisfied customer that morning. Members of this thriving cut-price food club have been queueing around the side of St Peter’s Church in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, all lunchtime. The initiative helps people stretch their budgets at the best of times, but now, in a cost of living crisis, it’s a godsend.  “Speaking for myself, I haven’t had to food shop in a supermarket since November,” says Margaret Bevan, who recently came back to live in Ashton to be near her family after several years of retirement in Norfolk. “The money I save here means I can afford to switch my heating on, and that’s the difference it makes.” The Bread and Butter Thing (TBBT) has been quietly growing for a few years, but the current economic squeeze – inflation is at a 30-year high – could see a huge expansion. The model is a kind of hyper-value weekly food shop: members pay £7.50 a week, and in return they get three pre-packed bags of healthy, high-quality surplus food with a shop value of about £35. There are fears that the cost of living crisis could overwhelm low-income families, with energy bills expected to rise by more than 40% after April. According to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, those increases would eat up to a fifth of the household budget for the average family, rising to 25% for single parents, and as much as 54% for single adult households on low incomes. Talk to TBBT members, however, and you realise this is no sudden shock or one-off. Life for many in this neighbourhood has been tight for years, though things have got harder recently. Natalie Leyland, a local mother, TBBT member and volunteer, gives an example from her weekly shop. “A bag of pasta in Asda used to be £1.20; this week it was £1.39. But my benefits haven’t gone up.” Indeed, she points out, her benefits have actually gone down, as the government withdrew the £20-a-week universal credit Covid top-up back in October. On top of that, there are council tax increases and rent top-ups to pay, and then the scarcely comprehensible energy bill rises. “The government have got it all wrong,” she says. “They should raise benefit rates or get energy capped.” Leyland is not alone. A survey of 2,000 TBBT members in November found that almost nine out of 10 said they were “worried” about energy costs this winter, with 38% saying they would not be able to pay their bills. One in four said they would have to borrow money to pay their energy bill, and almost half said they would cut down on energy use. Families with three children or more are most fearful, while those on universal credit or other benefits are twice as likely to go into debt to pay energy bills. “Everything is going up in price, but the pound in your pocket is worth less than it’s ever been,” reflects Craig, a 42-year-old father and full-time carer standing in the queue by St Peter’s. “I had an email the other week telling me the gas and electric is going up by £1,500 this year. To be honest it works out cheaper to buy oversized fleece-lined hoodies for everyone than to have the heating on for a week. It’s that sort of scenario now.” What about “heat or eat”, the perennial winter dilemma of the UK’s hard-up? “Not yet, thank God,” he says. “The kids would come first, no matter what. They’d eat a meal; I’d have a sandwich. We’ve got a good family; they’d bail us out, but we are in 2022 – you don’t want to be going cap in hand to your parents.” There are currently more than 22,000 TBBT members attached to 56 hubs (pop-up weekly distribution venues) in some of the most economically deprived neighbourhoods of Greater Manchester and the north-east of England, many of them in “food deserts” poorly served by supermarkets. Last year it distributed about 50,000 tonnes of food. It is a registered charity, though its founder, Mark Game, sees it as more of a non-profit food retail business. TBBT, he says, is essentially a weekly veg box for people on low incomes who are struggling but want good-quality food and like a bargain. He treats his members as customers, not beneficiaries, as people who are making active choices in the food they buy. They often shop at both TBBT and the supermarket. Game is slightly irked by comparisons to food banks. Unlike many food banks, TBBT members do not need a referral and there is no requirement to “prove” dire hardship. There is a strong social and self-help element. It is not the full-on retail experience, nor is it charity. “We are bridging the gap between crisis food and supermarkets,” he says. Game says his customers are perhaps not the ones in the most extreme need but those who have times when they struggle, not dissimilar to Theresa May’s “just about managing families”. They are probably in the bottom quarter of income, and often food-insecure, but not destitute and not in need – yet – of emergency food. “[Our customers] are being hit hard now,” says Game. “Brexit, Covid, the energy crisis and no real increase in incomes.” Inside the church, the food bags are packed with practised efficiency. This week there are blackberries, asparagus and spring onions, as well as such staples as apples, oranges and potatoes. The next line of bags contains eggs, butter, cereal and Marmite, and the final line of bags has chilled goods: sausages, goat milk, strawberries and pies. “Food you wouldn’t be able to afford to buy,” says one member. All of this was heading to landfill or animal feed before TBBT stepped in. Dr Megan Blake, a senior lecturer at Sheffield University and a food security expert, says the TBBT model offers positive support for struggling families: “In the current context, where prices are increasing and energy costs rising, it helps keep the tide back, but it is not enough on its own; we do need a government policy shift.” Amid the positivity of TBBT, there is a lot of barely contained anger at the wider social issues, not least the sense that privileged politicians have little clue about the reality of life close to the breadline. “People are having to choose to get the heating on or feed the children,” says Tanya Ladley, a TBBT member and volunteer from nearby Guide Bridge. “The poverty is disgusting. I’ve never known it so bad.” As the food club packs up and the last customers leave, there is a feeling that with the right backing, the TBBT could and should reach a lot more people. Bevan, a TBBT member and volunteer, says: “We don’t want to be perceived as ‘poor northerners’ and we are not. We are typical people trying to make our money go further and that’s it. That’s why people are happy to come here.”",News/UK news,How northern food clubs are helping stretch budgets in cost of living crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/20/bread-and-butter-thing-food-club-manchester-cost-of-living-crisis
1/21/2022,"Good morning. The Omicron outbreak of Covid cases appears to have peaked in New South Wales, Victoria and other parts of Australia, epidemiologists believe. Prof Adrian Esterman, an epidemiologist and biostatistician at the University of South Australia, said the Omicron wave had “absolutely certainly” peaked in NSW and Victoria. But with states recording tens of thousands of new daily cases and hospitals under immense pressure, it remains a long road out of the crisis. National cabinet met on Wednesday to agree on a common approach to school reopening, but states are expected to individually announce their plans in the coming days. Meanwhile, the reopening of Western Australia has been suspended to allow West Australians to get booster shots. And there are warnings that millions of Australians could be left empty-handed when the government’s free rapid test scheme launches on Monday, with pharmacies citing severe supply and cost pressures. The United States has alleged that Russian intelligence is recruiting current and former Ukrainian government officials to take over the government in Kyiv and cooperate with a Russian occupying force. The US Treasury on Thursday issued sanctions on two Ukrainian members of parliament and two former officials it said were involved in the alleged conspiracy, which involved discrediting the current government of president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. “Russia has directed its intelligence services to recruit current and former Ukrainian government officials to prepare to take over the government of Ukraine and to control Ukraine’s critical infrastructure with an occupying Russian force,” the Treasury statement accompanying the sanctions said. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris has joined in on the White House’s campaign to repair Joe Biden’s flub on Ukraine in his press conference on Wednesday, where he revealed Nato is divided on how to respond to a “minor incursion” from Russia.  Skilled migrants and graduates still trapped by ongoing border restrictions for bridging visa holders have condemned their “brutally unfair” treatment by the Australian government, saying it will drive away workers at a time of dire labour shortages. Travel restrictions remain for those who hold bridging visa B (BVB), which usually allows holders to live in Australia and travel abroad while they await government decisions on more permanent visas. But BVB holders have found themselves stuck in Australia due to a combination of huge blowouts in visa processing times and the border restrictions, which make it near impossible for them to enter the country or to re-enter after leaving. Armadas of alien-like sea creatures called bluebottles have been washing up on Australian beaches in ‘“gobsmacking numbers”.

American film-maker Kelly Duda, who revealed how contaminated blood taken from prisoners in Arkansas was sold around the world, faces up to three years in prison in Italy if found guilty. Duda has been put on trial in Italy for “offending the honour or prestige” of an Italian prosecutor, an offence that dates back to Italy’s fascist period. The billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk’s brain chip startup is preparing to launch clinical trials in humans that could “enable someone with paralysis to use a smartphone with their mind faster than someone using thumbs,” according to Musk.

As the planet warms, the Arctic treeline is accelerating towards the pole, turning the white landscape to green. The trees used to creep forward a few centimetres every year; now they are leaping north at a rate of 40 to 50 metres a year.

Don’t listen when people tell you about the noble value of a job, says advice columnist Eleanor Gordon-Smith. “While it’s true that some people find meaning in their career or use it to forge an identity they’re proud of, the fact that’s true for them doesn’t mean it should be for you.” Instead, try to find a way to restore your sense of agency. Just as people hold on to a wardrobe full of clothes that they haven’t worn in years, we like to keep an idea of ourselves that is from the past. “I was pretending to be a hedonist,” writes Brigid Delaney. “But perhaps it was time to confront the fact that I was actually the opposite and had been for some time.” Millions of Australians are heading to the supermarket and facing empty shelves, but it’s not due to a lack of supply.

1/21/2022,"In early January, Brooks Nader, a 26-year-old Sports Illustrated swimsuit model, was walking home alone from a night out in New York when she received a disturbing iPhone notification telling her she was carrying an “unknown accessory”. “This item has been moving with you for a while,” the alert read. “The owner can see its location.”  That’s when she knew “something wasn’t right,” Nader told the NBC news program Today. Nader discovered that somebody had slipped an Apple AirTag into her coat pocket while she was sitting in a restaurant earlier. Unbeknown to her, the device tracked her location for four hours before Apple’s abuse prevention system triggered the notification to her phone. AirTags are wireless, quarter-sized Bluetooth devices that retail for $29 each. Apple launched the product in April 2021 as tracking tools that users can pair with the company’s Find My app to help locate lost belongings, like backpacks or car keys. Yet AirTags have proven easy to abuse – police in New York, Maryland, Idaho, Colorado, Georgia, Michigan, Texas and elsewhere both within the US and internationally, have reported instances of AirTags being used to stalk individuals, as well as to target cars for theft. Last week, the New Jersey Regional Operations & Intelligence Center issued a warning to police that AirTags posed an “inherent threat to law enforcement, as criminals could use them to identify officers’ sensitive locations” and personal routines. Months after AirTags hit the market, Apple added abuse-mitigation features, including pop-ups like the one Nader received, and an alarm that beeps at 60 decibels (a conversational volume) after the AirTag has been away from its owner anywhere between eight to 24 hours. Near the end of 2021, the company released a new Android app called Tracker Detect, which was designed to help people who own Androids discover suspicious AirTags near them – yet the app must be proactively downloaded and kept active to be effective, and is only compatible with Android 9 or higher. The outcome of more anti-stalking mechanisms is that more people are realizing they are being stalked. On 14 January, police in Montgomery county, Maryland, responded to a call from a person who was stalked home from a movie theater after an AirTag was planted on their car. Around the same time, two California women called 911 after receiving a notification that their whereabouts were being tracked while out shopping. A 30 December report from the New York Times cites seven women who believe AirTags were used to surveil them. On social media, posts from mainly women sharing their own experiences of being tracked by AirTags have drawn attention to the issue, with one TikTok video from November 2021 receiving more than 31m views. If you suspect you’re being tracked, the conventional wisdom is not to head home, but rather call – or go to – the police. However, law enforcement responses to incidences of AirTag stalking have thus far been inconsistent, and help is not always guaranteed. When Arizona’s Kimberly Scroop went to local police after receiving an iPhone notification that she was being tracked in September last year, “they were not interested in taking a report, they didn’t take my name or phone number,” she says. “They said if I noticed someone following me, to call the police then.” Scroop went home and made a TikTok video about her experience being tracked, thinking she should “make as much noise as possible, so there was some public record of it” online in case anything bad happened to her. “I was having a mini panic attack, just really scared,” she says in the post that has now been viewed more than 5.5m times. In New York, Jackie’s Law – passed in 2014 to allow police to charge people using GPS tracking devices to stalk victims even if the victims have not pressed charges – contributed to police in West Seneca’s decision to subpoena Apple for information about a case involving an AirTag attached to a victim’s car bumper. Nonetheless, Nader claims she was unable to file a report after being tracked in Tribeca, New York City, as police told her no crime had been committed. In an official statement, Apple says it will cooperate with police “to provide any available information” about unknown AirTags people discover on their person or property. “We take customer safety very seriously and are committed to AirTags’ privacy and security,” says a spokesperson. Apple added anti-stalking mechanisms to AirTags after concerns were raised, and suspicious AirTags can be easily disabled when discovered. Even then, “If you really are nefarious and evil and you really want to find someone, there are things that are much better than an AirTag,” in the $100 to $300 range, says Jon Callas, director of technology projects at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Indeed, stalking affects an estimated 7.5 million people in the United States each year, and one in four victims report being stalked through some form of technology, according to the Stalking Prevention Awareness & Resource Center. And it’s on the rise: a 2021 international study by the security company Norton found the number of devices reporting stalkerware daily “increased markedly by 63% between September 2020 and May 2021” with the 30-day average increasing from 48,000 to 78,000 detections. There are thousands of different stalkerware variants, such as Cerberus, GPS tracking devices and Tile, a Bluetooth-enabled AirTag competitor that announced a partnership with Amazon last spring. To Callas, the conversation around AirTags is drawing much-needed attention to the potential for technology to be misused; he hopes more people will consider the safety risks of tracking devices, regardless of how innocent they seem. “If you make a generalized technology that helps you find your lost keys, it can help you find anything,” he says, “and that includes people.”",News/Technology,‘I was just really scared’: Apple AirTags lead to stalking complaints,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/20/apple-airtags-stalking-complaints-technology
1/21/2022,"How big is the Friday night fixture between Watford and Norwich? “It’s very big,” says Claudio Ranieri. “We all know how important it is,” says Dean Smith. The two managers are “fighting” against adversity (Smith) and will “crash” into each other in the quest for three points (Ranieri). In the end, however, “the Premier League doesn’t stop”, as Ranieri puts it, or at least not until “the most important part … after 38 games”, in the words of Smith. So maybe it’s not that important after all.  Smith and Ranieri were brought into their clubs mid-season to help reverse downward trends, but are still in the relegation mix. It’s a mix made all the muddier by 22 Covid-induced postponements which mean last-placed Burnley have played four games fewer than Norwich and two fewer than Watford, who are 17th but could fall into the bottom three should they lose to the Canaries at Vicarage Road. If anyone truly knows what’s going on in the Premier League basement then nobody’s admitting to it, and Smith’s and Ranieri’s pre-match press conferences were classic examples of saying just enough to not reveal much at all. But after Watford’s visit to Newcastle last weekend, which ended with Ranieri’s side earning a late deserved point, this fixture will provide more evidence as to how the leading candidates for the drop are placed as we enter the business end of the season. Norwich are everyone’s favourites for a second return to the Championship in three years, partly because that’s the natural order of things, but also due to some woefully weak performances. But since Smith took charge in mid-November there’s been a series of stronger showings too, the latest coming last weekend in a 2-1 victory against Everton. “It certainly lifted the place,” Smith said. “There’s been a bit more of a spring in the step in the training ground this week. That’s what a performance and a win can do for you. I felt like the squad was getting back to a healthier and a stronger position, and I thought the performance against Everton was good and it was a deserved victory.” Last Saturday’s result was built from a 4-4-2 formation which Smith said he had developed out of necessity for the previous match against West Ham, when he had only two fit central midfielders. Kenny McLean has returned to fitness after Covid and that may allow a change of shape against Watford, perhaps one of those occasions where, as Smith said, “we have to deny the space behind us against some of the big counterattacking teams.” Counterattacking is how Watford caused Newcastle a lot of pain and how they have hurt Norwich again and again over the course of five consecutive wins in recent meetings. Ranieri has not been in charge for any, however, and he suggested there may be a safety first element to his approach, with Watford – incredibly – still to keep a clean sheet this season. “We have to win but we don’t want to lose,” Ranieri said. Whereas Norwich have the confidence inspired by victory, Watford’s is brought by the performance of three new signings against Newcastle: the Brazilian centre-back Samir, the left-back Hassane Kamara and the midfielder Edo Kayembe. “They brought quality experience and a new strength to the team,” Ranieri said. “Now we are a very good block.” The Italian also has the goalkeeper Ben Foster back from injury just as Norwich have lost Tim Krul to damaged shoulder ligaments. “It’s a big loss,” Smith admitted. Media and fans will spend much of the hours before kick-off trying to discern messages in the tea leaves, to see which team are better placed for a match that means so much. To that end it may be instructive to read the thoughts of both managers on how to deal with the pressure. For Smith, it is about process. “Pressure’s a privilege at times,” he said. “It’s how you control yourself and your feelings and your emotions under that pressure. If you can maximise your clearer thoughts during those periods then you get better performances.” For Ranieri, it’s balance. “I am used to working under pressure, pressure is normal,” he said. “If there is too much pressure you have to zero down the pressure; if you see your players are a little too happy you have to kill them.” After the lights go out at Vicarage Road, we’ll have a little more clarity as to which of these two managers has read the situation right.",Sport/Football,Watford and Norwich under pressure in Premier League survival showdown,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/20/ranieri-and-smith-try-to-shrug-off-the-pressure-watford-norwich-survival-showdown
1/21/2022,"A “very tense” behind-the-scenes row over how quickly hospitals in England can be expected to reduce the massive backlog of surgery has broken out between NHS bosses and ministers. The dispute has delayed publication of the government’s “elective recovery plan”, which Downing Street had indicated would be part of Boris Johnson’s “Operation Red Meat” political fightback this week.  Johnson’s plan for salvaging his premiership after revelations of lockdown-busting parties at Downing Street has been to announce a slew of populist policies, including freezing the BBC licence fee for two years. No 10, the Treasury and Department of Health and Social Care are pressing NHS England to ensure that hospitals do as many operations as they can, as quickly as possible, in order to tackle the backlog, which now stands at a record 6 million patients. They want to impose “stretching and demanding” targets on hospitals, sources with knowledge of the discussions said. However, NHS trust bosses say the ongoing impact of treating patients sick with Covid, due to the current Omicron surge, longstanding gaps in their workforce, exhaustion at the frontline and record levels of staff sickness, mean they need time to get back to doing as much surgery as they did before the pandemic. The Treasury is said to be frustrated with NHS England and privately believes it is “foot-dragging” over the targets. NHS bosses for their part fear the plan is being driven by “political expediency”, given the growing concern at the sheer number of people facing long delays for care. One source said: “The Treasury are keen to set out some pretty bold targets but there’s been pushback on that [from the NHS]. The Treasury are saying ‘let’s really crack on’, and the NHS is saying ‘let’s just keep it real and remember the pressures on us just now from Covid, the vaccination programme and other things.’” Both sides agree that targets for what percentage of pre-Covid levels of non-urgent care hospitals should get back to providing, and by when, will be a key element of the “elective recovery plan”. It was due to appear last month but was delayed when Omicron struck in early December and threatened to overwhelm the NHS, forcing some trusts to cancel some non-urgent surgery. However, hospital bosses say the targets have to be “realistic”, given the pressures they are under. One NHS official said ministers needed to be pragmatic and “not set up the NHS to fail”. Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents health service trusts, said: “We need to set stretching targets but the worst thing the government could do is to set unrealistic targets that risk undermining public confidence in the NHS if and when they are not achieved.” Ministers should wait several weeks, until the full impact of Omicron is known, before finalising the targets, he added. Hospitals were already doing their best to make inroads into their waiting-lists, Taylor said. “But they are facing a demand crunch of rapidly rising demand for care, high hospital admissions from Covid and staff absences that are double the normal level for this time of year.” The fast-growing backlog of care is emerging as a key political priority for Johnson. Last week brought another set of grim NHS performance figures. They showed that the number of people on the waiting list had reached almost 6 million, that more than 2 million people had already waited beyond the supposed maximum of 18 weeks and 18,585 had waited more than two years. The waiting list already stood at 4.4 million before the pandemic. But Covid’s disruption to many normal hospital services, and people’s reluctance to seek NHS care while infection rates have been so high, have pushed it to record levels. It has been growing by about 150,000 people every month since last year. The prime minister has appointed a team of officials, all with significant NHS experience, to advise him how waiting lists can be brought down and to scrutinise NHS England’s progress. Sir Michael Barber, the ex-head of Tony Blair’s Downing Street delivery unit, who is a firm believer that targets ensure the NHS delivers, has been advising the health secretary, Sajid Javid, on the backlog. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of the hospitals group NHS Providers, told the Health Service Journal earlier this week that ministers should wait to see Omicron’s full effect on the NHS before finalising the detail of what the targets will be. “The bit that needs careful thought, and risks not being done if the plan is rushed out too quickly, is what difference Omicron is making and what the NHS can sensibly commit to, particularly for 2022-23, given the significant disruption that the Omicron surge has caused”, he said. A DHSC spokesperson said: “The pandemic has put enormous pressures on the NHS, but we are committed to making sure people get the treatment they need. “We have provided an additional £5.9bn to help tackle the Covid backlogs and we are investing £36bn over three years. The elective recovery plan is an important part of our recovery, and we will set out the details in due course.” Meanwhile, patients who are worried that they may have cancer but are having no luck with their GP can call a hotline for help, a health minister has told MPs. Maria Caulfield, the minister for patient safety and primary care, told the Commons health and social care committee that the NHS was piloting cancer hotlines staffed by nurse specialists as a route towards rapid diagnosis.",News/Society,Ministers and NHS bosses clash over surgery waiting list targets in England,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/20/ministers-and-nhs-bosses-clash-over-surgery-waiting-list-targets-in-england
1/21/2022,"It’s one thing for Terry Smith to take a swipe (slightly unfairly) at Unilever management’s love of seeing purpose in mayonnaise, which was last week’s entertainment. The latest missile from Mauritius, which is where Smith resides while picking the stocks for his £29bn Fundsmith fund, is more serious and better-aimed. Framed as a “postmortem” on Unilever’s abortive £50bn tilt at GlaxoSmithKline’s consumer products business, it was scathing on management, strategy, long-term performance and communication – all the big stuff.  The numbers didn’t add up on the GSK deal in terms of returns on capital, or not in a way Unilever was prepared to explain, argued Smith. Unilever’s share price has lagged rivals’ for years and management responds with “meaningless platitudes”. The new strategy of targeting beauty, oral care and over-the-counter medicines would take the company into areas where it has little expertise. Management – “or someone else if they don’t want the job” – should improve the current business before attempting new challenges. This column would dispute the idea that acquiring the GSK business would have been a leap into the unknown. The logic wasn’t wacky. As the Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo put it, the widespread hostility to the deal would almost make you think Unilever had proposed buying a defence contractor rather than “a purveyor of toothpaste and headache remedies”. Quite. Yet Smith’s advice to fix the current assets will resonate. His fund’s £800m investment represents a stake of slightly under 1%, but the lack of appetite for an enormous “transformational” deal is widely shared. That is the main lesson of this week. The chief executive, Alan Jope, if he values his job, would be wise to concede as much when he unveils his latest strategic thinking next month. If he wants Unilever to be bigger in consumer health and beauty and smaller in food, the process will have to be gradual. Deal-making on a smaller scale needn’t be off the table, but shareholders primarily want to see hard operating improvements. There aren’t big bargains out there to justify the risk of betting the farm The board of Unilever should also reflect that, under different chairs and different chief executives, it has badly misread the mood of shareholders twice in four years. The other occasion was the plan to incorporate solely in the Netherlands; a U-turn to the UK followed. It hardly helps that Nils Andersen is near-invisible compared with most chairs of top-10 FTSE 100 companies. He needs to get out and about: the repair job with investors is getting bigger by the day. Smith, incidentally, also made a fair point when he said the GSK consumer unit now faced its own test. If £50bn was a “fundamental undervaluation”, which was the GSK board’s view of Unilever’s offer, a par score for valuation has been set. After the demerger happens in the summer, performance will be judged from that mark. It would be unfair to expect the independent business, which has yet to be given a name, to deliver £50bn on day one. Analysts’ expectations, after all, were grouped around the £45bn level. But it will be expected within reasonably short order. 2021 was “an eventful period” for Entain, says the chief executive, Jette Nygaard-Andersen, in the Ladbrokes and Coral group’s end-of-year trading update. You bet: the company received bids from two US suitors, both of whom eventually walked away. Nygaard-Andersen could also have said it was correct to give both approaches a frosty reception. Entain does not need to sell itself because BetMGM, the bit that excites outsiders, is doing fine. In the gold rush that is the liberalising US market, its revenue rose fivefold last year to $850m. The figure still isn’t huge but if the US operation can achieve its long-term aim of keeping a 20-25% share of its market, Entain will eventually own half of a very substantial business. The interesting sideline is what has happened to the two would-be bidders’ share prices since they tried their luck – a critical consideration since both offers mainly came in form of paper rather than cash. DraftKings’ has halved since September, and so is in no position to take a second run. By contrast, MGM Resorts, Entain’s joint venture partner in the US, is up by a third. It is the only credible acquirer, just as seemed obvious last year, because the existing partnership is set. Marriage still looks a likely eventual outcome but time is on Entain’s side. Just let US market liberalise further.",News/Business,Time for Unilever boss to concede lack of appetite for a big tilt | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/jan/20/time-for-unilever-boss-to-concede-lack-of-appetite-for-a-big-tilt
