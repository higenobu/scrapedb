12/25/2021,"Ministers could meet as soon as Monday to determine whether new restrictions are needed in England over the new year amid growing concerns that soaring Covid cases could hit public services. They will be expected to assess new modelling from the University of Warwick, given to the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) in documents published on Thursday.  Scientists have looked at the effects of a potential return to step 2 restrictions from 28 December or 1 January, lasting either two weeks, four weeks or three months until 28 March. No 10 said the data had not yet been considered by ministers. Step 2 – part of last year’s roadmap – includes a ban on indoor social mixing, a return of the rule of six, and bars and restaurants only able to serve outdoors. It comes as new ONS figures showed one in 35 people in England had Covid last week, with 1.7 million people testing positive across the UK. No 10 said officials would continue reviewing the latest hospital data over Christmas but that ministers would not meet again until Monday at the earliest. “We are worried about workplace resilience,” one government source said. “That’s a key reason to reduce the isolation days [from 10 to seven] but a decision will have to be taken in the round, taking in hospitalisations and severe illness, which should be clearer over the weekend.” A Whitehall source said any restrictions based on workplace concerns would likely be targeted at sectors rather than being broadbrush but ministers had not ruled out legal guidance coming in next week. The government’s Covid-O committee, which has been focused on the functioning of services and workplace absences, is expected to review the situation again after the Christmas weekend. Pat Cullen, head of the Royal College of Nursing, told the BBC there was a “very, very depleted workforce” due to the number of staff forced into isolation. Dr Jenny Harries, the head of UK Health Security Agency, said there were a number of factors as well as the variant’s severity, that would be taken into account when ministers convene after the Christmas weekend to discuss further restrictions for England. Despite the soaring cases, hopes have been raised that new restrictions could be avoided after analysis showing the risk of hospitalisation is up to 70% less for people with Omicron compared to those infected with Delta, according to the first UK government study of its kind. Harries said ministers would need to take a holistic approach about how widespread case rates were impacting essential services – as well as numbers being hospitalised. “Ministers will look at all of the data that we have available –– and that isn’t simply what the epidemiology is saying, it’s how it’s impacting society,” she told the BBC. “So, for example, we have very high rates of individuals off sick – we know that particularly in London, around one in 35 have currently got Omicron. Now that’s having an impact on the workforce. So these are not simply about hospitalisation rates.” She added that ministers are being kept updated daily and that will continue throughout the Christmas period. “I don’t think we do know yet that this is going to be a significantly less serious disease for the population – the older population – that we are normally most concerned about in relation to serious disease and death.” The Sage documents found “an apparent slowing of growth rates” which could be linked to self-policing of behaviour. But the papers said there were still “doubling times in most of the country … in the region of two to three days and, importantly, test positivity rates are still rising.”",News/World news,Decision on stricter Covid rules for England may come on Monday,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/24/decision-on-stricter-covid-rules-for-england-may-come-on-monday
12/25/2021,"A white Christmas may be on the way for the uplands of north Wales and northern England, while festive flurries and bracing temperatures will set in on Boxing Day, with the Met Office issuing warnings for snow and strong winds across the north of England and central Scotland from the early hours of Sunday. Snow is predicted to fall in Snowdonia and the Pennines on Christmas Day, with more expected from the early hours of Boxing Day across the north of England and southern Scotland.  With cloud and rain forecast for southern parts of the UK on Saturday, this band is expected to move northwards, then turning to snow over the higher parts of northern England and then southern and central Scotland. Motorists in south Wales and south-west England have been warned to take care on the roads with heavy downpours expected. Temperatures are forecast to plunge to as low as -2C in some parts of the north and east of England between Christmas Day and 28 December, although weather across most of the UK will be slightly warmer than average for this time of year, with southern England enjoying mild temperatures of between 7C and 9C. A warning has been issued for snow over some upland areas, coupled with strong, gusty winds, which the Met Office says could lead to hazardous travel conditions on 26 December. Combined with strong winds, gusting between 35mph and 45mph in places, this could lead to challenging travel conditions across higher Pennine and Cumbrian routes, as well as the Scottish Southern Uplands during the early hours of Sunday. The Met Office also warned that temporary blizzard-like conditions may be encountered above around 300 or 400 metres elevation. These conditions will probably move into some hillier central parts of Scotland during Sunday morning, while snow turns back to rain further south. Chief meteorologist Frank Saunders said: “The Christmas period will be unsettled for much of the UK this year. Many will see wet and cloudy conditions as mild air dominates the south and west of the UK. “This contrasts with the cold air in the north-east, which brings that chance of some snow, most likely over the Pennines and the southern half of Scotland, and perhaps a little more likely into the early part of Boxing Day. Added to the mix is a strong easterly wind, especially in northern areas, which will make it feel particularly cold.”",News/UK news,Chance of white Christmas in parts of north Wales and northern England,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/24/white-christmas-parts-north-wales-and-northern-england-uk-weather
12/25/2021,"My father, Trevlyn D’Cruz, who has died aged 83, was an accountant who became managing director of the publishing company New English Library (NEL) in 1974. His years there read like a primer of 70s culture: he distributed Bob Guccione’s Playboy magazine rival, Penthouse, was involved in the launch and distribution of the feminist magazine Spare Rib, and published Richard Allen’s hugely popular youth culture novels, including Skinhead and Suedehead. He also worked closely with authors such as Harold Robbins, Stephen King and James Herbert, and secured the UK rights to L Ron Hubbard’s Battlefield Earth. On one occasion he was invited to lunch with Hubbard in California, but arrived to find the great man represented at the table only by a framed portrait and some senior Scientologists.  Trev, as he was widely known, was born into India’s mixed-race Anglo-Indian community to Kathlyn (nee Belletty), a telephonist, and Samuel D’Cruz, a commercial buyer, in the Entally district of Calcutta (now Kolkata) during the last years of British rule. Evacuated to the countryside during the second world war, he was again moved away from the city in 1947, this time to avoid the civil strife that accompanied independence and partition. As a result he was schooled at Goethals, an austere Congregation of Christian Brothers school in the Himalayas. After studying intermediate commerce in Calcutta, he went to England on his own, aged 16 in 1955, doing articles with a firm of accountants in Battersea in south London and qualifying as a chartered accountant in 1961. The move to the UK was supposed to be a temporary one, but in the event he never went back to live in India. In 1961 his father died, and instead of returning home, he brought his mother and youngest sister to London. Trev’s new roots in England were already firmly planted as he had, upon arrival, fallen in love with Jill Rogers, the daughter of the couple who ran the boarding house where he lived in Balham. They married in 1964 and remained together until Jill’s death this year. Working first as an accountant at the Morgan Crucible factory in Battersea, in the early 70s he became financial director of NEL, and was appointed as its managing director in 1974. Leaving NEL shortly after it was sold to Hodder & Stoughton in 1982, he established a new publishing company, Quadrant Books, before going on to manage the commercial arm of the Institute of Chartered Accountants from 1985 to 1999, when he retired. He then became immersed in voluntary work for various charities, including Wandsworth’s Foster Board, Merton Women’s Aid, the Rosemary Simmons Housing Association and the Diabetic Society. Widely admired for his charm and wit, Trev was a noted host and entertainer. He is survived by his two daughters, Emma and me, our foster brother, Jason, five grandchildren, Jack, Raphael, Ollie, Theo and Evie, and his sisters Anita and Yvonne.",Arts/Books,Trevlyn D’Cruz obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/24/trevlyn-dcruz-obituary
12/25/2021,"Derek Pearsall, who has aged 90 died of cancer, was one of my earliest academic colleagues and a friend for more than six decades. When he joined the English department at King’s College London in 1959 as assistant lecturer in Old and Middle English, Derek was four years my junior, both in years and in the job, and there were similarities in the social background and experiences of national service and earlier teaching that had brought us together in this role. Born in Birmingham, the second child to Elsie (nee Rawlins), a housewife, and Joseph Pearsall, a shop fitter and toolmaker, Derek attended King Edward grammar school in Camp Hill. From there his brilliant school-leaving results gave him entry to Birmingham University as a student of English, the first person in his family to go to university.  A first-class degree gave Derek the opportunity of postgraduate study under the medievalist Geoffrey Shepherd, which he completed after a period of national service in the RAF. His MA thesis on the Gawain poet received a mark of distinction. From KCL, Derek went on in 1965 to a lectureship, and later a professorship, at the newly founded University of York, where he collaborated with Elizabeth Salter and Barrie Dobson of the history department to found the Centre for Medieval Studies in 1968. He built up a core following of postgraduate students who were inspired by his teaching to become pioneers of research in medieval literature in universities throughout the world. They were joined in later years by a multitude of scholars who could claim Derek as sometime mentor. In 1987, after a number of visiting professorships in the US and Canada, he became Gurney professor of English literature at Harvard University, where he remained for 13 years, continuing to train new graduate students and adding to an impressive record of publication in 14th- and 15th-century literature. In 1952 he married Rosemary Elvidge in 1952 in King’s Lynn, Norfolk. They had met three years previously, while students at Birmingham. In all, during a lifetime of scholarship and research, he was sole or joint author of 32 books, among them definitive lives of the poets Geoffrey Chaucer and John Lydgate, and an edition of the C-text of the Middle English Piers Plowman. He was also author of 120-plus articles on medieval literature, and reviewer of more than 100 books published by other scholars in this area of research. Nothing of this huge learning was ever on display in the exchanges of everyday life. In casual conversation he was always the same benign and affable, very ordinary person. Rosemary died in 2004, and their eldest son, Simon, five years later. Derek is survived by four children, Sarah, Mary-Ann, Judith, and Daniel, and his grandchildren, Jamie, Elspeth, Tom, Gregor, Ben and Jessica.",News/From the Guardian,Derek Pearsall obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2021/dec/24/derek-pearsall-obituary
