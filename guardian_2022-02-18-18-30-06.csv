2/18/2022,"A Swedish gold medallist has said it was “extremely irresponsible” to hold the Winter Olympics in China because of the government’s human rights record. Nils van der Poel, a 25-year-old speedskater, made the comments after returning home from the Beijing event, where officials have been at pains to keep politics and protest out despite diplomatic boycotts.  Van der Poel told Sportbladet he had “a very nice experience behind the scenes”, but that the decision to give Beijing the Games was “terrible”. “The Olympic Village was very nice, the Chinese people I met were absolutely amazing,” he said. “The Olympics is a lot, it’s a fantastic sporting event where you unite the world and nations meet. But so did Hitler before invading Poland, and so did Russia before invading Ukraine. “I think it is extremely irresponsible to give it to a country that violates human rights as blatantly as the Chinese regime is doing.” Governments including the US have accused China’s government of conducting a genocide in Xinjiang, through its long campaign of forced assimilation against ethnic minorities including Muslim Uyghurs. An estimated 1 million people have been detained in mass detention and reeducation centres, and the general population has been subjected to acts of religious and cultural suppression, alleged forced labour, and enforced birth control. Several human rights and legal groups have said the actions amount to crimes against humanity. Beijing denies all accusations of human rights abuses, and says its policies are part of anti-terrorism efforts and poverty alleviation programmes. Human rights groups had called for widespread boycotts of the Winter Olympics by governments and sponsors. Several nations including the US, UK and Australia staged a diplomatic boycott of the event, while there has been significant focus on athletes’ ability to protest. Human rights advocates had warned athletes about conducting any activism, including making statements, while in Beijing for the Games. The US Nordic skier and former Olympian Noah Hoffman said athletes had a powerful platform, but advised them to stay silent in Beijing. “They can speak out when they get back.” Acts of protest at the Games are generally against the rules set by the International Olympic Committee, which also warned athletes not to protest at the Tokyo summer Games, or face potential punishment. However, there are mounting concerns over the increasing intolerance of protest, dissent or criticism in or against China. Prior to it starting, a Beijing official warned any athlete behaviour that is against the Olympic spirit or Chinese rules or laws would be subject to “certain punishment”. China’s government and Olympic officials have insisted the Games should be free from politics, but when asked at a press conference on Tuesday about human rights issues, committee spokesperson Yan Jiarong dismissed human rights violations among the Uyghur Muslim population as “lies” and insisted Taiwan was part of China.",Sport/Sport,"China’s human rights record made Winter Olympics ‘irresponsible’, says Swedish athlete",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/18/chinas-human-rights-record-made-winter-olympics-irresponsible-says-swiss-athlete
2/18/2022,"NatWest is giving its bankers bigger bonuses this year after the group, still majority-owned by taxpayers, bounced back to a £4bn profit in 2021 as the economy recovered from the coronavirus pandemic. The lender said it had increased its bonus pool to £298m, a 44% increase on a year earlier.  Alison Rose, the chief executive of NatWest, said it was a “restrained bonus pool” and added that the bank was “very mindful of the challenges that our customers are facing with inflation and cost of living”. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We need to make sure we are rewarding fairly.” Rose’s total pay for 2021 was £3.6m, up from £2.6m a year earlier. It came as NatWest reported statutory pre-tax profits of £4bn, a return to profitability after a £351m loss a year earlier, as the bank benefited from the UK’s economic recovery from the pandemic. The bonus pool for 2021 was 3% lower than the £307m for 2019, before the pandemic. Rose added the bonus pool was reduced in 2020 to reflect the bank’s performance during the first year of Covid, when it was loss-making. Rose said the lender was aware of the cost of living crisis being experienced by its customers, in the face of rising inflation, but said it was “not seeing any signs of strain at the moment” among households and businesses. “For lots of customers and businesses actually, these are challenges that they haven’t faced for almost 10 years, so these are new challenges,” Rose said. NatWest, which is still majority-owned by the UK government, returned £1.7bn to taxpayers in dividends and share buybacks in 2021. The taxpayer stake in the bank formerly known as Royal Bank of Scotland has reduced to just under 51%, and is expected to move below 50% in the coming months. Rose said it was “in the government’s hands” when ministers would opt to sell down the remaining stake.",News/Business,NatWest increases bonus pool by 44% as bank returns to profit,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/18/natwest-increases-bonus-pool-bank-returns-to-profit
2/18/2022," Its array of comically unreliable narrators make Craig Gillespie’s 2017 biographical drama about disgraced US figure skater Tonya Harding an edgier, wittier proposition than the facts would suggest. Self-proclaimed “redneck” Harding (Margot Robbie) has real talent but lacks the clean-cut presentational skills required to woo the judges. How she ends up accused of plotting an attack on rival Nancy Kerrigan is a tragicomic story of a horrifically pushy mother (the Oscar-winning Allison Janney), domestic abuse – courtesy of husband Jeff (Sebastian Stan) – and one stupendously inept criminal enterprise. Robbie gives it her all as the girl given a terrible hand in life who is determined to make it work.Thursday 24 February, 10pm, BBC Four Steven Soderbergh’s lean, gripping Hitchcockian thriller stars Zoë Kravitz as Angela, a “voice stream interpreter” for an Alexa-style virtual assistant called Kimi. She has become trapped in her (salary-inappropriate) apartment with agoraphobia, as trauma from an assault is exacerbated by Covid lockdowns. But after hearing what she thinks is a murder she pushes herself to go outside to solve the “crime”. Rear Window and The Conversation are clear touchstones but that doesn’t detract from the film’s pleasures.Saturday 19 February, 12.40pm, 8pm, Sky Cinema Premiere A classic of British social realism, Ken Loach’s 1969 drama also has a large dose of symbolism in its story of a poor boy and his wild bird. David Bradley’s put-upon working-class teenager Billy is looking at a dismal future stuck on his Barnsley estate, but training a baby kestrel offers him an imaginative freedom unavailable in his school life or at home. The ritual humiliations of a PE lesson and canings by the headmaster show how education without empathy can destroy lives, but a glimpse of hope is offered by the natural world.Saturday 19 February, 9.05pm, Talking Pictures TV The multifaceted Daniel Day-Lewis nails the classic Hollywood hero type in Michael Mann’s sweeping adaptation of James Fenimore Cooper’s romantic adventure novel. Day-Lewis’s noble, hard-running Hawkeye – adopted son of a Mohican – is drawn into the British army’s frontier war against the French and their Huron collaborators, while falling for Madeleine Stowe’s sparky colonel’s daughter. Despite elements of “white saviour” in the plot, and shady historical accuracy, it’s visually arresting stuff, particularly in the chase sequences.Sunday 20 February, 6.55pm, AMC A rare chance to see one of Terence Davies’s less celebrated films – but any film by him is worthy of your time. He takes his poetic, image-led focus on the lives of children to 1940s America with an adaptation of the novel by John Kennedy Toole (of A Confederacy of Dunces fame). It follows Jacob Tierney’s David, whose harsh life in rural Georgia – where Bible Belt religion wields a constrictive power – is brightened by his Aunt Mae. Gena Rowlands is vibrant as the has-been singer with a rebellious streak.Monday 21 February, 2.05am, Film4 There’s a distinct touch of Jesus to Alec Guinness in this brilliant 1951 Ealing satire. His wide-eyed, unworldly scientist, Sidney, invents a cloth that never gets dirty and lasts for ever. Of course, this will not do, as the textile industry would become defunct, so an unholy alliance of capital and labour races to prevent him bringing it to the public. Master director Alexander Mackendrick sets the scene with a lightness that belies the tragic beating down of Sidney’s creative impulses – from the musical plops and parps of his lab apparatus to Joan Greenwood’s mellifluous turn as the factory owner’s daughter.Friday 25 February, 1pm, BBC Two A remote town in Brazil is attacked by trophy hunters in search of human prey in Juliano Dornelles and Kleber Mendonça Filho’s sly modern western, which riffs on 30s horror The Most Dangerous Game. The first sign of something wrong is when the settlement vanishes off online maps, but matters soon turn bloody. Udo Keir is in charge of the braggadocious post-colonial invaders, but he little realises that the good folk of Bacurau, including Sônia Braga’s doctor and Silvero Pereira’s outlaw, have a fierce community spirit and psychotropic drugs on their side.Friday 25 February, 12.45am, Film4",Arts/Television & radio,"I, Tonya to Kimi: the seven best films to watch on TV this week",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/18/i-tonya-to-kimi-the-seven-best-films-to-watch-on-tv-this-week
2/18/2022,"Andy Parker has never watched the video of his daughter’s murder. But anyone with an internet connection can find it, view it and share it. In the years since Alison Parker, a 24-year-old TV journalist in Roanoke, Virginia, was shot and killed during a live broadcast in 2015, her father has made it his mission to remove the footage from the social media platforms where it continues to resurface even after being taken down.  Volunteers help him flag the content to YouTube and Facebook. He has appealed to the companies directly, testified before the Senate, even filed complaints with federal regulators, alleging the platforms were violating their own terms of service by hosting the videos. After years of pleading his case as a grief-stricken father, Parker now believes a seat in Congress may be his best recourse. “I always wanted to honor her life with action,” Parker said in a recent interview by Zoom, a framed photo of his daughter on a shelf behind him. “I think that is what has compelled me to do this.” He continued: “I had fought this battle as a private citizen as long as I could. The only way to fix it is through Congressional action. That’s it.” Parker is seeking the Democratic nomination in Virginia’s newly redrawn fifth Congressional district, now a thumbprint-shaped expanse stretching from the center of the state to its border with North Carolina. The district is currently represented by congressman Bob Good, a staunch conservative who voted to overturn the results of the 2020 election and has promoted Donald Trump’s “big lie” that widespread fraud cost him the presidency. In a video announcing his candidacy, Parker said he was running “to make the internet safer for kids and for families”. The reel includes images of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, while arguing that the economy is tilted against middle-class Americans. “In America today, we’ve got an economy that makes tech billionaires rich enough to go to space, while young people can’t afford to go to college,” he says in the ad. Parker is hopeful he can appeal to a wide cross-section of voters with a unifying message and a platform centered on reforming big tech, a cause that has galvanized lawmakers in both parties. “Republicans, they want their kids to be safe online, too,” he said. “If I could get to Congress”, he added, “I would champion this cause, not just for me, but for all these people who have been harmed.” Alison Parker’s boyfriend, Chris Hurst, also channeled his grief into political activism, winning a seat in the Virginia House of Delegates after campaigning as a gun-safety advocate. He served two terms before losing his re-election in a Republican wave last November. Before he was “Alison’s dad”, Andy Parker was a Texas transplant pursuing an acting career in New York. A career change ultimately brought Parker to southern Virginia, where he settled with his wife and children, Alison and Drew, and became involved in local politics. He was working as a talent recruiter for the banking industry when Alison was killed. “If you’ve heard of me,” Parker says in his campaign video, “it’s probably because of what happened on August 26th, 2015.” On that day, Alison Parker, an on-air journalist with WDBJ-TV, was fatally shot by a former co-worker while conducting an on-air interview near Roanoke. Cameraman Adam Ward, 27, was also killed. The interview subject, Vicki Gardner, survived, and the gunman, who recorded the shooting and uploaded it to his social media accounts, killed himself. Seemingly overnight, Andy Parker became one of the most prominent advocates of gun-control in Virginia, a state with a tragic history of mass shootings and home to the NRA headquarters. For years, Parker lobbied the state legislature to enact gun-safety legislation, sometimes aggressively targeting Republican opponents of those efforts. Activists celebrated a major victory in 2020, when the state’s then-governor, Ralph Northam, a Democrat, signed into law a suite of new gun restrictions that had become a legislative priority in the aftermath of a mass shooting at a municipal building in Virginia Beach that left 12 people dead. A day before Parker spoke to the Guardian, two officers were fatally shot at Bridgewater College in Virginia, just a 10-minute drive from the university where his daughter attended journalism school. “Every mass shooting, it’s just like a gut punch,” he said. “But this one was particularly tough because these are friends. This was close. We have a pandemic of gun violence along with the Covid pandemic. It’s nuts and it’s got to stop.” More recently, Parker has trained his ire on big tech. But he said he hasn’t abandoned his gun-control activism. The issues, he said, go “hand in hand”. Supporting gun-control legislation, he said, made him a target of online trolls and conspiracy theorists claiming his daughter’s killing was faked as part of a plot to seize their firearms. Some of the attacks used edited or doctored footage of her murder. “At one point there were ads running on Alison’s murder,” he said. “How disgusting is that?” He pointed to the revelations provided by the Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen as proof that tech companies could do more to police the misinformation and hate that proliferate on their platforms. “They have the ability to do it. They have the algorithms. They have the AI to do it,” he said. “But they don’t because they profit from it. They want people to stay engaged and to stay on the site. That’s how they make money.” Parker said he supports some of the bipartisan proposals to reign in big tech. But he believes more needs to be done to hold them accountable. He has called for reforming Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which has largely shielded social media platforms from legal liability for content generated by its users. “For all the great things that Facebook and Google have done, bringing people together, they’re also in the process of tearing this country apart,” he said. He also hopes to demystify the process for users by making platforms and regulators like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) more responsive. If elected, Parker said one of the first things he would do in Congress is push for a hearing with the FTC chair to ask: “What are you doing? You know, these companies are violating their own terms of service, and you’re saying nothing.” Parker filed complaints with the FTC against YouTube and Facebook. But the process has been opaque and disillusioning, he said. Parker, who must first win the Democratic nomination, knows he faces an uphill battle in a district rated safely Republican by political prognosticators. Democrats face historical headwinds this cycle, after a crushing defeat in the Virginia governor’s race last year. But Parker said battles against the NRA and big tech have steeled him for an underdog campaign. He believes there’s enough “buyer’s remorse” in the district to make the race competitive. Days after Good was sworn in, he voted to overturn the results of the 2020 election. The congressman’s embrace of falsehoods and misinformation about the 2020 election and the coronavirus, Parker argued, have contributed to the toxic political environment that had gridlocked Washington. “He is the Marjorie Taylor Green of Virginia and his antics are wearing thin on people,” he said. Good’s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment. When Parker announced his candidacy last month, he braced for the onslaught of trolls and online abuse. But so far, he said the response has been overwhelmingly positive. “Candidates for congressional office don’t have running mates, but I do,” Parker said, his voice catching. “And she will be with me every step of the way.”",News/US news,His journalist daughter was killed.

2/18/2022,"Manfred Eicher, visionary founder of Munich’s boundary-busting ECM Records, once described a band led by the Tel Aviv-born, New York-honed trumpeter/composer Avishai Cohen as “one big octopus.” Eicher noticed that Cohen conjures bands in which the participants are individual limbs that react spontaneously within an ineffable group mind, yet never lose their individuality – much like the band-leading methods of Miles Davis, Cohen’s key model. Naked Truth is a barely-40-minute miniature of an album, beautifully executed and steered by the idea that improvising musicians good enough to play any headlong stream of consciousness can reveal a lot more if they sometimes play only a fraction of what they know.  In the first lockdown, Cohen focused on tiny fragments of melody that formed the cues of this nine-part improvised suite. When he took them to the studio with longtime allies Yonathan Avishai (piano), Barak Mori (bass) and Ziv Ravitz (drums), leaving out whatever felt superfluous was the rule. Cohen’s soft, perfectly rounded notes, leaning graceful lullabies into Mori’s plummy bass sound, give way to gentle piano ostinatos coaxed by whispering cymbals that build a rising insistence; elegantly classical modulations over mallet rolls resolve in mournful high-pitched horn lines and startlingly nimble runs; almost ceremonial bugle-like calls turn to quivering laments. At the close, Cohen evocatively reads Israeli poet Zelda Schneurson Mishkovsky’s Departure, a cherishing of small miracles within the ostensibly familiar that he’s very good at himself. Listeners all the way from Davis’s muted-trumpet soliloquies on 1960’s Sketches of Spain to Tord Gustavsen’s meticulous 21st-century ensemble jazz (in which every delicate drum hit sounds spontaneous and inevitable) will find plenty they recognise – and more besides – in Cohen’s quietest but maybe boldest adventure. Cecil Taylor, the technically awesome, stylistically and temperamentally uncategorisable African American piano virtuoso, died in 2018. Four years later, much of a previously lost November 1973 concert at New York City’s town hall (originally sidelined because one track runs to 88 minutes) has emerged as The Complete, Legendary, Live Return Concert (Oblivion Records), a historic digital-only addition to Taylor’s discography. A brilliant quartet comprising regulars Jimmy Lyons (alto sax), Sirone (bass) and Andrew Cyrille (drums) finds the implacable master in blistering form. UK pianist Kit Downes unveils a terrific acoustic trio of cool fluency and conversational ease (including an oblique view of Jimi Hendrix’s Castles Made of Sand) with bassist Petter Eldh and drummer James Maddren on Vermillion (ECM), New York-based saxophone/drums pairing of Ingrid Laubrock and Tom Rainey step up a gear with the arrival of young bassist Brandon Lopez on No Es La Playa (Intakt), and free-sax legend Evan Parker veers in and out of abstraction and classic themes by Monk and Billy Strayhorn with bassist Dave Green’s trio on Raise Four (Trio Records).",Arts/Music,Avishai Cohen: Naked Truth review | John Fordham's jazz album of the month,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/18/avishai-cohen-naked-truth-review-ecm-records
2/18/2022,"The philosopher Nina Power believes men are under attack. Western society has done away with “the positive dimensions of patriarchy”, that is, “the protective father, the responsible man, the paternalistic attitude that exhibits care and compassion.” In her new book, What Do Men Want?, she expresses the hope that, “following a great deal of bitterness in recent years, men and women can reconcile on the basis of a renewed and greater understanding of one another” and advocates a return to “old values and virtues — honour, loyalty, courage”; rather than being made to feel guilty for their gender privilege, “Boys and men must be allowed to be good, to become better.” These are worthy sentiments, but the underlying premise is doing a lot of heavy lifting. Just how prevalent is “the current demonisation of men”? Have compassion and virtue really been abolished? Are boys not presently allowed to be good? The sweeping, simplistic and vaguely sour tone recalls the handwringing “culture wars” opinion pieces that have proliferated in recent years. They invariably follow a template: an obscure incidence of arguably overzealous identity politicking – usually involving a university campus – is held up as evidence of a deep civilisational malaise. The alarmist register can make for compelling clickbait, but whether it can sustain a serious, book-length work is another matter.  To give us a sense of 21st-century male ennui, Power presents a cursory overview of the masculinist online communities known collectively as the “manosphere”. At the relatively respectable end of the spectrum we find Canadian self-help guru Jordan Peterson, whose brand of commonsensical conservatism has helped lots of young men find a sense of direction in their lives. (“Many people, it seems, desire the kind of certainty that comes from someone saying basic things in a stern manner,” she notes.) At the more extreme end are gender separatist groups such as Men Going Their Own Way, and self-styled incels (involuntary celibates). Power argues we should try to understand these communities rather than treating them as pariahs. She invokes the trajectory of notorious “pickup artist” Neil Strauss, who authored a bestselling manual on chatting up women before eventually seeing the error of his ways, to show that redemption is possible. Intriguingly, she suggests the subculture around obsessive self-improvement contains a kernel of radical leftism: “If pro-masculinist books have an appeal … it is in large part because they present an image of an escape from various kinds of depressed, morose types of masculinity in a consumerist, hedonistic society.” In this analysis, the restraint and discipline advocated by, for example, the NoFap movement – which preaches abstinence from masturbation and pornography – is re-conceived as a form of anti-capitalist resistance. After years of febrile identity politics discourse, it can be refreshing to read a writer urging us to come together and put aside our differences. But what does that actually mean? To whom is Power referring when she writes, in an apparent dig at contemporary feminists, that “we should be wary of those who seek to generate resentment by pitting men and women against each other”? Set against her caricaturing of bien-pensant liberalism, Power’s ostensibly reasonable call for compassion feels at best platitudinous, at worst disingenuous or even reactionary: most forms of political struggle involve some measure of conflict between competing groups; to renounce this altogether amounts to a politics of quietism. There is of course something to be said for the idea that cultivating personal virtue can mitigate the apathy and alienation of modern life, but most people already do this – after a fashion. There may indeed be some pockets of misandry here and there, but they hardly amount to a societal “war … against men”. And while many members of incel communities are probably just decent guys who lost their way, enough of them are thoroughly vile for the movement to be of concern. As with so many sallies in the culture wars, there is little substantive insight here – just a simmering animus against a largely imagined enemy.  What Do Men Want?

2/18/2022,"For something that reminds you by turns of Charlie Kaufman, Wes Anderson, Orwell and Kafka, plus Devs and Dollhouse and half a dozen other sci-fi series and workplace comedy-dramas, Severance (Apple TV+) is an impressively idiosyncratic thing, wholly itself and confident in its mission to make your mind implode. This is ironic, given that the conceit of the show, directed by Ben Stiller, is essentially the bifurcating of brains. At Lumen Industries, data inputter Mark (Adam Scott, quiet inheritor of Tom Hanks’s everyman mantle) and his colleagues on “the severance floor” have all undergone a procedure that separates, absolutely, their work selves (“innies”) from their home selves (“outies”).  Their innies input data for eight hours a day, get into the elevator at the end of it and “transition” to outie mode on the way down to the lobby. One has no idea what the other does with its time and any anxieties or burdens carried in either mode do not bleed into the other. It is, supposedly, the work-life balance made flesh. Except, of course, it is a little more complicated than that. Mark underwent the procedure after his wife’s death, to escape the pain of grief for at least half his waking life – although, as his pleasingly sardonic sister says, “I can’t help but feel this isn’t the same as healing”. Perhaps this is true for all of them – a deeply touching friendship between meticulous control freak Irving (John Turturro) and Burt (Christopher Walken) starts to develop in a way that suggests Irving might be hiding from something on the outside – but newcomer Helly (Britt Lower) seems to regret her choice. “Am I livestock?” is one of her first questions when she wakes up on the conference table with no memory. “Did you grow me for food?” Maybe her outie is more of an optimist, but I like to think some things endure between worlds. Helly repeatedly tries to resign – or escape, which on the severance floor seem to be virtually synonymous – only to be thwarted at every turn. In the process, a lot of functional details are explained that might otherwise prey on viewers’ minds. I am not going to enumerate them here, but the thoughtfulness that has gone into building the premise and the careful working out of various points is indicative of the quality of Severance as a whole. As the series unfolds, it doesn’t just pose but considers, unhurriedly and intelligently, profound questions about what makes a self, the existence of free will, the appearance of choice and much, much else. If it weren’t so often so deeply funny at the same time, it would soon plunge you into a smooth-sided pit of existential despair from which you would never emerge. It also, in the innie scenes, manages to skewer the lighter aspects of life under late western capitalism. Competitive colleague Dylan proudly accumulates pointless workplace prizes (a whole cupful of fingersnap toys, a drawerful of hand-drawn caricatures of himself) and is still eager for more. Group photos, bonding games and office parties are approached with the mandated joyfulness that secretly lies at the heart of them all in real life. And then there is the creeping malevolence of Lumen/the corporate US itself. What the company actually does – precisely what data the protagonists are actually spending their days sorting into unnamed files – is unknown. But the signs are not good, given that they are presided over by the unbending, unsmiling – and unsevered – boss Harmony (Patricia Arquette) and her only-too-smiley and equally unsevered assistant, Mr Milchick (Tramell Tillman, turning in an hypnotic and utterly terrifying performance). They revere Lumen’s founder – a monument to whom dominates the building’s lobby. That mystery is set to be unravelled when a man sits down in front of Mark and tells him he is his former colleague and best friend Petey (with no memory transferral between the two worlds, innies, of course, don’t recognise fellow innies when they are on the outside). He has undergone a supposedly impossible re-integration procedure, is on the run and has information on Lumen’s terrible purpose. This reassuringly traditional moment and instantly addictive narrative thread is another prophylactic against falling into the aforementioned pit of despair. Severance looks beautiful and is directed with enormous sensitivity and style by Stiller. His quartet of oddball actors, Arquette (a frequent Stiller collaborator), Turturro, Walken and Tillman, elevate an already shining script and a story that is always a finely calibrated 12 to 15 degrees off kilter, while the everyman quality of Scott throws the whole into perfect relief. It might be slightly slow to get going, but thereafter becomes one to savour.",Arts/Television & radio,Severance review – Ben Stiller’s workplace fantasy might make your mind explode,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/18/severance-review-ben-stillers-workplace-fantasy-might-make-your-mind-explode
