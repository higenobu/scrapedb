2/4/2022,"For nearly a week, Paul Aubue, has lived and slept in the cab of his truck, parked in downtown Ottawa. The 64-year-old grandfather travelled from New Brunswick to join hundreds of others as they descended on the Canadian capital. Aubue, the owner of a trucking company, said he’d been driven to protest by a recent requirement that truckers be vaccinated against Covid.  “I’m here for freedom. This whole thing has been going on for two years and it seems everyday there’s something more. We don’t need a vaccine passport,” he said, adding that family had dissuaded him from getting vaccinated. “People die everyday, people born every day – that’s nature.” The vast majority of truckers – and Canadians – are vaccinated against the coronavirus, however. And most Canadians, even though they’ve grown tired of the pandemic, also say they’re against the sustained protests, which have paralyzed central Ottawa and forced businesses to close. But as tensions rise between protesters and local officials, analysts say the recent events could signal the birth of a growing populist movement which could potentially reshape Canadian politics. Despite the cold, Aubue said he’s been well taken care of by organizers and some residents who oppose public health measures. He says he’s received hot meals and fuel to run the truck’s generator for heat. Another protester, Philip Grenier, said he would remain in Ottawa “for as long as it takes” for the federal government to repeal pandemic restrictions – although almost all such rules fall under provincial jurisdiction. But for local people say the protests – which have included honking truck horns, but also allegations of assault and intimidation – have left them frustrated, fed up and – at times – in fear of leaving their homes. A local woman who gave her name as Jennifer said that she’d been harassed by a group of men wearing Canada flags as capes and shouting “Freedom!” before two other men in an idling truck called her a “dumb cunt sheep” for wearing a mask. “I’m just done with these people,” she said. When Tim Abray, a communications consultant, attempted to take a picture of the protests, he was confronted by three men who grabbed and shoved him. He said nearby police officers failed to intervene. Ottawa police chief Peter Sloly told called the protests “intolerable” and unprecedented” as officers began ramping up enforcement. Police say they have laid charges against three people and have 25 active investigations, including the desecration of the National War Memorial and incident at a soup kitchen, where employees and clients were harassed. On Thursday, Justin Trudeau rejected suggestions that the military might be called in to end the protest. “One has to be very, very cautious before deploying military in situations engaging Canadians,” he told reporters, adding that a military response was not on the cards “right now”. But Ottawa police say the situation has become increasingly difficult to navigate, and with more protests planned for the weekend, all options are on the table. Police say that a number of protesters are believed to armed, and amid growing calls for counter protests, there is growing of fear that violence could erupt. Officers say their strategy has been to defuse tensions, but critics say that other demonstrations, including those by Indigenous peoples, are often met with force. “It’s OK if angry white men do it, because they are politically aligned with you, but it’s not OK if Indigenous people peacefully protect their own rights,” Indigenous lawyer and professor Pam Palmater told APTN News. The pandemic – and the public health restrictions that came with it – have brought together a number of disparate movements and ideologies, including far-right and separatist groups. “The pushback to government overreach or public health policies brought QAnon, the Proud Boys and ‘sovereign citizens’ or anti-government people into the same room,” said Amarnath Amarasingam, a researcher into extremism and populism movements at Queen’s University. On Thursday, Romana Didulo, the self-proclaimed “Queen of Canada” arrived in Ottawa along with her supporters. Didulo, a QAnon linked conspiracy theorist, was recently arrested after calling on her 70,000 online supporters to shoot health-care workers. “These groups have proven they can mobilize very quickly and actually get people to give up their lives and go on a trip across the country, which is not an easy thing to do in the middle of winter,” said Amarasingam. “But I’ve been thinking about where all this energy goes when, inevitably, nothing happens, because their goals are so lofty that they’re never going to be met. How do they actually get out of this and save face?” The group organizing the protest has already raised more than C$10m online, although the fundraiser was paused by GoFundMe on Wednesday. But members of Trudeau’s Liberal party and the Ontario provincial premier are unlikely to meet the protesters’ demand for an audience. But the spectacle has caught the attention of influential far-right voices in the United States, including former president Donald Trump and his son, and Fox News host Tucker Carlson. Tesla founder Elon Musk also tweeted his support of the truck convoy. On Wednesday, Ottawa police said a “significant” amount of the funding and organizing was coming from the United States. US politics was dramatically reshaped by the Tea party movement in the 2008s, changing the makeup of Congress and shifting political rhetoric. Canada’s electoral system tends to reward more centrist parties, but the recent protest has elevated the profile of previously fringe characters, including those who espouse Islamophobic and xenophobic views. With a vacuum in the Conservative party leadership, high-profile members of the party have actively courted the protesters, suggesting they see value in what could be a growing populist movement. Conservative politicians, including the former party leader, have posed with protesters outside parliament, in a stunt that Ottawa’s mayor described as an “absolute disgrace”. But the willingness of MP to embrace the protesters speaks to the mainstreaming of more fringe views, say experts. “They’re hedging their bets to see where the political current goes, and how this movement drives broader political and electoral trends. They want to be the ones that ride the fence for as long as possible to decide where their allegiances are in order to keep their jobs,” said Amarasingam. “If Canadian populism becomes this anti-government, anti-immigrant, anti-refugee and racist fringe and if some elected officials feel like that segment of the population is useful, that’s going to colour the discourse in terms of how we actually do politics in Canada. That’s a larger concern,” said Amarasingam. “If it goes the way of the United States, that’s just as destructive, even if we don’t have somebody in power.”",News/World news,Ottawa protests: tensions grow as ‘intolerable’ truck blockade paralyzes Canada capital ,https://www.theguardian.com/discover-cool-canada/2022/feb/03/ottawa-protests-tensions-grow-truck-blockade-paralyzes-canada-capital
2/4/2022,"That sound you can hear – that faint but persistent chuckle – is Kim Cattrall laughing. The actor was the only one of the original Sex and the City cast to decline to join And Just Like That …, the sequel to the much-loved, era-defining show. The rest of them stayed, and suffered. But at least they were getting paid. Viewers – if they did stay, which many of us did out of a potent blend of desperate hope that things would improve, and fascinated horror as they did not – had no such solace. The end of the 10-episode run has now been reached, with the finale refusing to redeem anything that had gone before. It could have, should have, been great. The idea of best friends Carrie, Charlotte and Miranda returning to navigate the complexities of female life and friendship in their 50s – a rare televisual sight – was a fine one (even if Cattrall’s Samantha would be missed). New writers and characters were brought in to address the glaring whiteness and heteronormativity of the original. Michael Patrick King was in charge, as he had effectively been for much of Sex and the City.  But what we got was a shambles. On every front, it was a mess. Some of it was no one’s fault. Claims from several women of sexual impropriety by Chris Noth (Carrie’s husband, Mr Big) meant he had to be hastily written out of flashback scenes. (Noth has described the allegations as “categorically false”.) Willie Garson (Carrie’s beloved friend Stanford) sadly died unexpectedly during shooting and a major storyline for him had to be abandoned, and the cracks papered over. The rest, however, was the result of deliberate and often bafflingly tone-deaf decisions. Samantha – one absence the show had plenty of warning about – was written out clumsily and unbelievably (the woman who had been diehard, diaphragm-fishing friends with Carrie for decades supposedly left for London in a huff after Carrie departed her PR firm). Characters of colour were written in with cringe-making crassness. They were given a maximum of one feature each (having doubts about IVF! Being unhappily single! Being – uh – a rich mother!) and paired off with one each of the trio to address their unwoke blind spots. Because that’s what normal people do? Because that’s what actors of colour are there for? It was virtually the “magical negro” trope, dressed up in designer clothes. The whole endeavour seemed like a box-ticking exercise, without any effort to weave zeitgeisty concerns into the whole – let alone manage it with the grace and humour that defined Sex and the City. Charlotte got a gender-fluid daughter (she wasn’t anything else. Just gender-fluid. Thassit). Miranda got Che Diaz (Sara Ramirez), Carrie’s non-binary boss, for whom Miranda leaves Steve after Che delivers her unto the heights of sexual ecstasy in Carrie’s kitchen while the abandoned, post-operative owner wets the bed. If this sounds like narrative chaos to you in summary, be assured it played no better in real time. Most disconcertingly of all, Miranda, Carrie and Charlotte seemed to have been written by people who had never seen or heard of Sex and the City. Miranda’s biting wit and cynicism were gone – they made her a quivering bunch of neuroses (with a drinking problem that disappeared almost before it had arrived) in a terrible grey wig instead. Carrie was a rich, grieving widow, devoid of all the scrappy drive and snappy lines that made her bearable the first time round. And Charlotte simply flapped over her non-problems through every episode. The promised exploration of the ageing process never came. A brief discussion of the ethics of hair dye here, a mention of menopause there, and Miranda’s leg going to sleep after she’d sat at a picnic table for lunch (again, it didn’t work any better if you saw it), and we were done. That Carrie’s hip problem turned out to be a congenital birth defect and not an “old lady” issue was emblematic of the whole show – frightened to show anything real, and taking the least troublesome way out possible, regardless of credibility. The women wandered through 2022 as if they had been asleep rather than simply off our screens for the last 20 years, so frightened by new concepts were they, so deep their levels of cultural estrangement. I don’t know the age range of the writers, but their work suggests that even their combined years barely made it into double figures. What could have been another groundbreaking iteration of the show was instead a regressive, embarrassing disappointment. And just like that – we’re back to square one.",Arts/Television & radio,"‘A regressive, embarrassing disappointment’: how And Just Like That ruined Sex and the City",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/03/a-regressive-embarrassing-disappointment-how-and-just-like-that-ruined-sex-and-the-city
2/4/2022,"Sometimes an outcome feels certain and, on this occasion, an Egypt win on penalties fitted that bracket. They are a tough watch and, against a Cameroon side that was lively but blunt, seemed content to grind through two hours’ play in order for a shot at what they do so expertly.  Their sixth consecutive win in a shoot-out, and their second in this Africa Cup of Nations, brings a final against Senegal and, for those marketing the tournament, a battle between the continent’s two star turns. In the event Mohamed Salah was not required to take a spot kick after Cameroon fluffed their lines from three, Clinton Njie lifting the final penalty high. Cameroon fell short in the first match to be played at Stade Olembé since eight fans died in a crush 10 days ago. The stadium had reopened its doors but, despite the efforts of those present, this hardly felt like the kind of festival the tournament’s organisers might have envisaged a fortnight ago. The attendance at kick off was fairly sparse, even though it would be bolstered by a section of 900 Egypt fans whose aeroplanes had cut it fine. Outside, the extra measures employed to avoid a repeat of last Monday’s tragedy appeared to be working: security personnel managed crowd control to the most minute detail, even upbraiding anyone deemed to be walking too quickly, and this time all the gates required for safe passage inside were kept open. But they were undoubtedly helped by the fact that many had chosen to stay away, making an under half-full arena a visually glum monument to what had passed. The vibrant scenes on the streets of nearby neighbourhoods in the buildup offered a reminder, at least, that the empty seats bore no correlation to the country’s passion for its national team. Once Cameroon got things underway, that was reflected by a noisy environment that urged António Conceiçao’s players forward. They should have been ahead by half-time. Cameroon have pressed aggressively over the past three and a half weeks, hunting in packs and posing a consistent menace down both flanks. That was evident when Karl Toko Ekambi blazed a trail to the right byline and saw a low centre stopped; it prompted a squall in which Egypt survived by the skin of their teeth. When Ekambi sent in an 18th-minute corner, Michael Ngadeu saw his header rebound off the angle of post and bar. The ball was smuggled behind and, from Moumi Ngamaleu’s left-sided delivery, an unmarked Ngadeu kicked it against his standing leg. Mohamed Abou Gabal was forced to punch clear ahead of Vincent Aboubakar moments later, having briefly looked second favourite, and at that point proceedings were rattling along at a tempo conducive to the hosts. Egypt prefer their football more fragmented, and gradually managed to slow things down, perhaps helped when Gabal required lengthy treatment after that intervention against Aboubakar. They rode their luck again when Ngamaleu skipped down the left before finding Ekambi, who miscued; by the break they had barely shown anything in attack although there was a sense that meant little. Salah had a golden chance to prove that point in the 58th minute. Egypt are masters at waiting for mistakes, and, when Martin Hongla left a backpass short, they appeared to have found their moment. Their talisman was first to the ball as he raced to meet it ahead of André Onana, who rushed 15 yards outside his area, but the keeper stuck out a foot and diverted it away. An empty net would have greeted Salah had he taken it around Onana, but his touch was poor and then Samuel Gouet, taking aim from 25 yards, thudded wide. Queiroz was then sent to the stands for haranguing the officials before the 90 minutes were completed, but at the end of the shoot-out he would be without a care.",Sport/Football,Egypt deny hosts Cameroon on penalties to book Afcon final with Senegal,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/03/gabals-penalty-shoot-out-saves-take-egypt-past-cameroon-into-afcon-final
