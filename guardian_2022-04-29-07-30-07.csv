4/29/2022,"As the minutes leaked away in east London, the trickle of West Ham fans heading for the exits began to swell and thicken: first dozens, then hundreds and finally thousands. By full-time there were white plastic seats as far as the eye could see. Perhaps this will come as no surprise to anyone who has ever found themselves trapped in the infamous London Stadium kettle, where the queues outside Stratford station can last well over an hour and you eventually begin to wonder whether you will ever see your family again. Still, with West Ham straining every sinew in search of a famous equaliser, it was a strange look. Certainly, you had to wonder at the risk-reward calculus. Cons: potentially missing a defining last-minute goal in your team’s first European semi-final for 46 years. Pros: getting a seat on the Jubilee Line. And as the home side slipped to a disappointing but if eminently retrievable defeat, it felt like an appropriate metaphor for a game in which they could just have dared a little more, dreamed a little harder. You couldn’t fault West Ham’s commitment. They ran and chased and weathered the frequent squalls of pressure with courage. They put their necks on the line, and sometimes – as when Jarrod Bowen painfully found himself on the wrong end of a cross from Filip Kostic – even more tender parts of their anatomy. But against an Eintracht Frankfurt side who had conquered the Camp Nou and no longer feared anything or anyone, West Ham needed players to step up, to gild the game with class, to take their chances. Too many of them had 7/10 games. Declan Rice tried. It had been a poor start for West Ham’s captain, failing to get close enough to Daichi Kamada or Rafael Borré as they created an opening goal for Ansgar Knauff within 50 seconds. But he grew into the game as it went on, playing braver passes, finding more dangerous spaces, keeping the attacks ticking over. Bowen tried. It was his spectacular bicycle kick deep into injury time that rattled the bar and brought the departing West Ham fans sprinting back through the concourses. Bowen was a nuisance all night, winning crucial free-kicks and checking the forward runs of Kostic. But as ever, the quality of his final ball was mixed and he should probably have scored a one-on-one early in the first half. But nobody tried harder than Michail Antonio. As West Ham reeled from the early Frankfurt goal, you could see David Moyes urging his side to recycle the ball quicker, to put it at risk, to get it forward. The game was already beginning to settle into a structure and that favoured Frankfurt. Borré was dragging West Ham’s defence out of shape and Sebastian Rode was running the midfield. What was needed was a dose of chaos. What was needed was Antonio. There are few more tantalising moments in football than the few seconds when the ball is rolling towards Antonio, with a defender close by. Long before the ball has reached either of them you can see them grappling and jostling for supremacy, a flurry of arms and legs and torsos at unusual angles, like two men playing Twister in the back of a Volvo. When the ball finally arrives, pretty much anything can happen: a clearance, a free-kick, a clear run on goal, an opposition counter-attack. You can never really be sure. Moyes’s side is well-organised, well-drilled and sometimes a little predictable. More than anyone it is Antonio who gives them that point of difference, that little twist of the unknown. Perhaps he lacks the consistency to be considered among the Premier League’s elite strikers. He can go on mighty hot streaks, but until his equalising goal here he had not scored in almost two months. But he always gives you an almighty work rate in attack and defence, a physical presence up front, and above all occupies defenders to the point where they are barely capable of thinking about anything else. West Ham looked a little flat in the second half, perhaps as a result of all those games in their legs, and too often the telling pass or quality cross seemed to elude them. Kamada’s winning goal was probably deserved and had he scored 12 minutes from time rather than hitting the post, the tie might already be over. But if there was a positive to come out of this game then the return of Antonio to scoring form might just be it: a timely jolt of confidence just as West Ham’s season begins to sharpen to a point. And nothing has been decided or settled yet. Lest we forget, Eintracht Frankfurt have won once at home in four months in all competitions, a team who thrive at breaking games open but are often less adept at controlling them. Urged forward by their boisterous home crowd, there will be frailties to exploit and wide open spaces to be found. And the tireless Antonio will be their best hope of finding them.",Sport/Football,Michael Antonio strives in vain to add twist of unknown for West Ham | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/28/michael-antonio-strives-in-vain-to-add-twist-of-the-unknown-for-west-ham
4/29/2022,"The premier of the British Virgin Islands (BVI) has been arrested in a sting operation in Miami on charges of conspiring to import cocaine into the United States and money laundering. The BVI governor, John Rankin, confirmed in a statement that Andrew Fahie had been arrested on Thursday morning, saying: “I realise this will be shocking news for people in the territory. And I would call for calm at this time.” Oleanvine Maynard, the manager director of the Caribbean territory’s port authority, was also detained in the operation in which DEA agents posed as cocaine traffickers from Mexico’s Sinaloa cartel, the Miami Herald reported. Liz Truss, the British Foreign Secretary, said she was “appalled” by the arrest. Truss said: “This afternoon, the premier of the British Virgin Islands, Andrew Fahie, was arrested in the United States on charges related to drugs trafficking and money laundering. “I am appalled by these serious allegations.” She said had held talks with Rankin and stressed the importance of the recent inquiry into corruption on the Caribbean archipelago. Last year, the UK set up a commission of inquiry into mis-governance in the British overseas territory, which has heard allegations of systemic corruption, cronyism, jury intimidation and misuse of public funds. In his statement, Rankin said Fahie’s arrest was the result of a US operation led by the US Drugs Enforcement Agency (DEA) and was not linked to the Commission of Inquiry (CoI) report. “The remit of the Commission of Inquiry focused on governance and corruption, and was not a criminal investigation into the illegal drug trade. To avoid unnecessary speculation, I intend to move ahead urgently on publication of the inquiry report so the people of the BVI can see its contents and its recommendations in the areas it addressed,” he said. Addressing the commission of inquiry last year, Fahie denied that there was any corruption in the BVI. He said: “The key to any country is its reputation, but so far, and thank God for that, there is no evidence provided in the CoI showing that the BVI is corrupt.”",News/World news,British Virgin Islands premier arrested on cocaine charges in US sting operation,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/28/british-virgin-islands-premier-arrested-miami
4/29/2022,"The ACLU helped Amber Heard draft the Washington Post article accusing Johnny Depp of abuse after the organization was promised a $3.5m donation from her divorce – though at least $500,000 of it eventually came from a fund connected to Tesla founder Elon Musk, jurors in the Depp-Heard defamation trial heard on Thursday. The American Civil Liberties Union’s general counsel, Terence Dougherty, testified that the organization decided to propose Heard as an ambassador for the group after Heard pledged the sizeable donation over 10 years. “Ms Heard spoke with such clarity and expertise on issues of gender-based violence that [ACLU representatives] decided she would be an appropriate person to ask to become an ACLU ambassador,” Dougherty testified. But of the $1.3m slice of the donation that was meant to come from Heard, $100,000 came directly from her ex-husband Depp, and, based on an email from Elon Musk, the court was told, $500,000 came from a donor-advised fund connected to Musk yet registered as a donation from Heard. Just $350,000 was contributed from accounts directly controlled by Heard, the court heard, and another $350,000 came from an anonymous donor, whom the ACLU believed to also be Heard. By 2019, when donations attributed to Heard dried up, the ACLU representative told the court it was the group’s understanding that “she was having financial difficulties”. “We didn’t receive any amounts in 2019 and on,” Dougherty added. As part of the relationship the ACLU forged with Heard, the group later agreed to draft the 2018 Washington Post article in which Heard said she was “a public figure representing domestic abuse” that lies at the center of Depp’s libel claim against his ex-wife. “Based on my review of higher drafts of the op-ed, I knew that it was referring to Johnny Depp and her marriage,” Dougherty said during the 2021 video deposition shown to the jury. The ACLU’s communications team sought to include Heard’s “fire and rage” on the subject, but internal ACLU emails, including drafts and changes to the article, reflect the organization’s concerns that references to domestic abuse could violate the terms of the non-disclosure agreement in her divorce. Heard, the court was told, had wanted a reference to her temporary restraining order against Depp mentioned in the article, but the reference was removed by her lawyers. “I think that Amber’s contributions to the portion of the op-ed that talks about personal experiences is part of what informed the view that this was a strong op-ed, and the importance of women’s rights issues,” Dougherty said. The ACLU and Heard, Dougherty added, were keen to have the article published in the week the film Aquaman was released to capitalize on her role in it. The court was told that the ACLU’s communications department contacted the Washington Post to pitch the article, saying: “As you know, Amber Heard was beaten up by Johnny Depp during their brief marriage.” The relationship between the ACLU and Heard, and the group’s role in drafting the article at the center of the case, comes amid reports that neither Musk nor James Franco will be testifying in the trial. The two celebrities appeared on Heard’s publicly available witness list at the start of the trial, but Musk’s attorney Alex Spiro has said his client will not testify. The Fairfax county court in Virginia was told that Heard had “spent time” with Musk while she sought to resurrect her relationship with Depp in 2016. This was two months after she had made allegations of domestic violence against Depp, the Pirates of the Caribbean actor, and after the couple had separated, the court heard. “You told me a thousand times [that] you were just filling space,” Heard’s talent agent Christian Carino texted Heard about Musk in 2017. “You weren’t in love with him.” Jurors were also told of Heard’s divorce negotiations with Depp after 15 months of marriage. Heard had initially asked for $4m before escalating her demands, said Depp’s accountant Edward White. “It went to $5m, to $5.5m … then it went to $7m, and $500,000 to her attorneys,” White said, before adding $13.5m for community liabilities under California divorce law. The payments, which Heard requested to come tax free, would have required Depp to make $30m, White said. White was also asked to describe Depp’s alcohol bill, which he said was $160,000 a year during Depp’s marriage and had now “dropped to virtually zero”. Malcolm Connolly, Depp’s longtime security detail and the last witness on Thursday, testified that he saw that “Amber wanted to wear the pants in this relationship”. Connolly testified that “she could get a bit frosty at the drop of a hat”. Over time, Connolly testified over video, he began to notice marks on Depp. “It would be scratches on his neck, maybe a fat lip in the corner. He had bruising on the eye socket. It would get more regular. Not every week, but it definitely happened, yeah.” On the couple’s honeymoon, a train trip from Bangkok to Singapore, Connolly said Depp had marks under his right eye. “He’s walked into a door, or a door’s walked into him,” he said to laughter in the courtroom after jurors were shown a photograph. Depp, he surmised, was not enjoying himself. “He was not happy. Not happy at all,” Connolly said. Connolly described removing Depp from the couple’s rented house in Australia in 2015 after the incident in which Depp’s finger was partially severed, allegedly after Heard threw a bottle of vodka at her husband. “It was like a cartoon exploding cigar,” he said. “It’s flapping around. I can see bone.” Heard, he testified, berated Depp as Connolly led him away from the house to his own apartment where he administered first aid, saying, “Fuck off! That’s what you always do, fuck off with you guys, you big man!” the court heard. The security guard said he had seen Depp under the influence of drugs on several occasions. “I’ve seen him smoke marijuana,” Connolly said. “I have my suspicions that when he was off to the bathroom he probably does cocaine. I’ve never seen him do it.” “He’s got a very high tolerance of any substance,” he said, adding, “I think Jack Sparrow was drunker than Johnny.” The trial continues.",Arts/Film,"ACLU helped draft article at heart of Depp v Heard case for $3.5m donation, court hears",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/28/johnny-depp-amber-heard-libel-case-aclu
4/29/2022,"Investigative reporter Sarah Ferguson will replace Leigh Sales as the presenter of ABC nightly current affairs flagship, 7.30, in July. Ferguson, who has been reporting from Washington DC for two years, is a forensic long-form reporter and a tough interviewer whose work made headlines when she fronted 7.30 for six months in 2014. Her opening gambit to then Liberal treasurer Joe Hockey on budget night was: “It’s a budget with a new tax, with levies, with co-payments. Is it liberating for a politician to decide election promises don’t matter?” The interview was nominated for a Walkley award and attracted accusations of bias, which the ABC rejected. “These are challenging times nationally and internationally, scrutiny of power is at a premium, but I have also witnessed in the US the destructive force of rancorous political division,” Ferguson, 56, said on Friday. “On a brighter note, I expect to enjoy the role hugely, interviewing is one of the true thrills of journalism. Working in collaboration with the inimitable Laura Tingle is irresistible.” The former Four Corners presenter and reporter had a run-in with News Corporation last year after her two-part Four Corners program Fox and the Big Lie took a critical look at Fox News and its relationship with Donald Trump. News Corp Australia responded by publishing 45 articles in just two days attacking the public broadcaster and Fox News sent a legal threat, saying the ABC had “clearly violated” its own standards by “exhibiting bias and a failure to maintain any level of impartiality in the presentation of news and information”. The complaint was investigated by audience and consumer affairs and was not upheld. The ABC managing director, David Anderson, said ABC audiences know and respect Ferguson. “Her work has set an unparalleled standard, not only in Australian journalism but internationally, as evidenced by her recent reporting from Ukraine,” Anderson said. The ABC’s new director of news, Justin Stevens, who has been the executive producer of 7.30, said Sales has done a “superb job” anchoring the program for the past 12 years. “The nightly role 7.30 plays in holding to account those in power is a key part of the democratic process and Sarah, along with the rest of the team, will ensure we continue the program’s proud history of delivering agenda-setting public affairs journalism,” Stevens said. Launched as a state-based program in 1986, 7.30 has been a national program since 1996 when Kerry O’Brien hosted until he stood down in 2010. In 2021 7.30’s national audience averaged 980,000 viewers a night with an audience share of around 13% in metro markets and 12.5% in regional areas, according to ABC figures. Ferguson joined the ABC in 2008 after working for SBS and the Nine network after arriving from the UK and France. She has won five Walkley Awards, including the 2011 Gold Walkley for “A Bloody Business”, an expose of Australia’s live cattle trade. Her documentary work includes the 2015 series on the Rudd-Gillard years, The Killing Season, and in the same year a landmark series on domestic violence, Hitting Home. In 2020 she presented Revelation, a ground-breaking documentary series on the criminal priests and brothers of the Catholic church.",News/Media,Sarah Ferguson to replace Leigh Sales as host of ABC’s 7.30 program,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/29/sarah-ferguson-to-replace-leigh-sales-as-host-of-abcs-730-program
4/29/2022,"Amazon announced its first loss since 2015 on Thursday as sales slowed, costs rose and its investment in electric vehicle company Rivian wiped out profits. The news sent Amazon’s shares tumbling by 10% in after hours trading. The tech giant’s revenues grew at a sluggish 7% in the first quarter to $116.4bn. For the same quarter last year, Amazon’s sales increased 44% to $108.5bn. It lost $3.8bn for the quarter compared with a profit of $8.1bn during the same period a year ago. The company warned there may be more losses ahead. For the current quarter, Amazon expects operating income between a loss of $1bn and a gain of $3bn, compared with $7.7bn in second quarter of 2021. Amazon’s stake in electric vehicle company Rivian was largely to blame for the loss. Amazon owns close to 20% of the company and lost $7.6bn after shares in the electric vehicle collapsed, falling by more than 50%. “The pandemic and subsequent war in Ukraine have brought unusual growth and challenges,” said Andy Jassy, the Amazon chief executive officer. Amazon was one of the biggest winners of the pandemic, recording huge jumps in sales as consumers moved to shopping online and companies turned to Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing unit, to run their businesses. AWS sales increased 37% over the quarter. As Covid-19 vaccination rates increase and hospitalizations fall, shoppers are switching back to bricks and mortar. In-store shopping rose 11.2% in March while online fell 3.3%, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse, a monthly transactions report. Amazon is not the only online retailer feeling the change. The share of retail purchases made online has dropped from 15.7% in the second quarter of 2020 to 12.9% during the last three months of 2021, according to Census Bureau data. But as Mastercard’s survey shows, online retailers gained hugely over the pandemic. E-commerce grew over 83% from March 2019 to March 2022 compared to a 9.4% growth rate for in-store shopping. The company faces additional pressure from employees across the country who are pushing to unionize and negotiate for higher wages, better working conditions and benefits. Earlier this month Amazon workers in Staten Island, New York, became the first to vote for a union in the US. Votes to establish a union at a second Amazon facility in New York will be counted on Monday and organizers say they have been inundated with calls from other Amazon outposts to help them set up unions. “Today, as we’re no longer chasing physical or staffing capacity, our teams are squarely focused on improving productivity and cost efficiencies throughout our fulfillment network. We know how to do this and have done it before. This may take some time, particularly as we work through ongoing inflationary and supply chain pressures, but we see encouraging progress,” said Jassy.",News/Technology,Amazon sees first loss since 2015 as shares tumble 10%,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/28/amazon-revenue-loss-shares-drop
4/29/2022,"The Beastie Boys and Fight For Your Right (To Party) was the appropriate backdrop after the full-time whistle blew. RB Leipzig and Rangers had been embroiled in a taut encounter which endorsed time-honoured theories about the mundane nature of semi-finals. The intensity of Leipzig celebrations as Angeliño cracked home a late goal, not at all in keeping with much that had come before, said it all. Leipzig had huffed and puffed. Rangers were resolute to the point where they will be sore about not returning to Glasgow with parity. But, crucially, the Scottish champions retain legitimate hope of a Europa League final berth. Their exploits at Ibrox in recent times should provide peace of mind ahead of the second leg. “We defended and played really well,” said the Rangers manager Giovanni van Bronckhorst. “We made it difficult for them to create chances. It is disappointing to lose a goal so late in the game but we know what we have to do next week. We know it’s not over yet. They also know it’s not over yet.” The drawbacks from a Rangers perspective relate to Leipzig’s impressive away form and the sense that the ordinarily prolific Christopher Nkunku surely cannot be as wasteful as was the case here. “We are not looking forward with fear but with happiness,” insisted the Leipzig coach Domenico Tedesco. “Ibrox is special and we will be happy to be there.” Does he think Leipzig will have to score in Glasgow? “Yes. But we are able to score.” There followed a devilish smile. In 16 earlier European matches this season, Rangers had not endured a spell without possession as was the case in the first quarter of this match. Yet for all Leipzig’s control, they failed to create serious opportunity. Nkunku should have done better after the hosts capitalised on a Borna Barisic error and Dominik Szoboszlai rued allowing Connor Goldson to recover after a half chance appeared but Leipzig’s early play lacked cutting edge. Boosted by this bluntness, Rangers duly enjoyed a far more coherent spell. James Tavernier, the captain, spurned a decent free-kick position moments before Goldson headed a corner over Peter Gulacsi’s crossbar. Leipzig were jolted into action; Tavernier provided a desperate block from Angeliño’s half-volley following a spell of pinball inside the Rangers penalty area. Konrad Laimer was next to threaten, with a teasing cross from the right which evaded all Leipzig attackers. This was, however, a pretty drab opening period. Leipzig, not unreasonably, seemed to regard themselves as the superior side but without the kind of ruthless style which would rock Rangers. Trickery from Ryan Kent almost afforded Rangers a dream start to the second half. Instead, the ex-Liverpool man’s subsequent shot flew wide. Van Bronckhorst had altered Rangers’ approach during the break, with Joe Aribo now the focal point of the attack with Kent and Wright switching to wider positions. The change was immediately effective, Tavernier seeing a shot at goal deflected for a corner. Nkunku replied, his 53rd minute blast actually the first time Allan McGregor’s palms had been stung. With 25 minutes to play, frustration from the home support was audible. No wonder; the sight of Benjamin Henrichs standing on the right flank with arms outstretched as no teammate sought the ball in a scoring position summed up Leipzig’s growing impatience. There was perhaps a broader anxiety, too, for a club looking to win a first European trophy since being founded in 2009. Red Bull’s heavy financial backing brings expectation. Nkunku, who already has 30 goals to his name in this campaign, was to endure a horror moment 20 minutes from time. The Frenchman did the hard part, shrugging John Lundstram aside before escaping a despairing McGregor dive. With the goal gaping, Nkunku blazed wildly over from just 12 yards. Leipzig now had cause to fear it may be one of those nights. Nkunku was profligate again, this time with a back post header from a terrific Angeliño cross. Leipzig appealed in vain for a penalty as Barisic clashed with Henrichs. The Germans needed something unorthodox, which was soon to arrive. McGregor had done well to tip a Tyler Adams shot over, with Fashion Sakala heading the resulting corner kick away. Enter Angeliño, who strode forward to lash a 20-yard volley through a crowd of bodies and beyond the helpless Rangers goalkeeper. Cue a wild celebration in front of the home dugout. Advantage Leipzig; yet one so slender to keep things very interesting.",Sport/Football,Leipzig’s Angeliño rifles in to hurt unlucky Rangers after battling display,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/28/rb-leipzig-rangers-europa-league-semi-final-first-leg-match-report
4/29/2022,"The House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol is expected to issue letters requesting voluntary cooperation from House minority leader Kevin McCarthy and around a dozen other Republican members of Congress, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The panel intends to issue a letter to McCarthy – the top House Republican – and is considering further letters to Scott Perry, Jim Jordan, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Mo Brooks, Lauren Boebert, Andy Biggs, as well as some Republican senators, the sources said. Congressman Bennie Thompson, the chair of the select committee, is expected to authorize the list of Republican members of Congress caught up in the investigation potentially as soon as this week. The letters may come either this week or next week, the sources said. The scope and subjects of the letters are not yet finalized, and the sources cautioned that the members of Congress approached for cooperation may still change. On Thursday, Thompson said only that he would send letters to McCarthy and other Republicans. But the select committee’s move to seek cooperation from some of Donald Trump’s fiercest defenders on Capitol Hill – and for some members like McCarthy, Jordan and Perry, the second such request – marks a new gear for the inquiry as it reaches its final stages. The new letters are being discussed internally as a final chance for cooperation before the select committee considers ways to compel their assistance, the sources said: once reluctant to pursue subpoenas against members of Congress, the mood on panel is changing. The panel has a renewed interest in McCarthy’s cooperation after new reporting this week showed he had told the Republican leadership days after January 6 that Trump admitted to him at least partial responsibility for the Capitol attack, the sources said. The select committee is particularly focused on whether Trump might have indicated to McCarthy why he believed he was culpable for the Capitol attack, the sources said, and whether the former president knew he may have acted unlawfully on January 6. Thompson is also considering letters to Greene and Perry and other Republicans who played an outsize role in the effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election and pressed the White House about Trump declaring martial law to stay in office, the sources said. The select committee wants to learn more information from members of Congress who were in constant text-messages communication with Trump’s former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, described by one of the sources as “those in the text message traffic”. A spokesman for the select committee declined to comment. Greene messaged Meadows on 17 January, according to one of more than 2,000 texts Meadows turned over to the investigation and obtained by CNN, that some members of Congress were calling for Trump to impose martial law to remain in power. “In our private chat with only Members several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call Marshall [sic] law,” Greene said in the text. “I just wanted you to tell him. They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next.” Meadows did not appear to respond to Greene’s text. But the messages Trump’s top White House aide was receiving shows the extraordinary ideas swirling around Trump after he and his operatives were unable to stop the certification of Biden’s election win on January 6. The newly-released text messages also show Perry, now the chairman of the ultra-conservative House freedom caucus, lobbying Meadows to replace the justice department leadership with Jeffrey Clark, a DoJ official sympathetic to Trump’s effort to undo the 2020 election. Greene and Clark were among the leading Republicans determined to overturn Trump’s defeat to Biden, according to the text messages – as well as testimony provided to House investigators by Cassidy Hutchinson, a Trump White House aide who worked for Meadows. The select committee appears to believe the time is right to request voluntary cooperation from the members, the sources said, capitalizing on the public outrage surrounding McCarthy’s remarks and the texts sent by the Republican members of Congress. Thompson on Thursday confirmed to reporters that he would certainly issue a second letter to McCarthy to appear before House investigators, as well as to Jordan and Perry, but declined to name other targets or how he would proceed if the requests were rejected.",News/US news,Capitol attack panel set to issue letters to Kevin McCarthy and other key Republicans,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/28/capitol-attack-panel-kevin-mccarthy-republicans-letters
4/29/2022,"The predominant feeling throughout Under the Banner of Heaven, and ambitious and uneven adaptation of Jon Krakauer’s 2003 nonfiction book, is dread. From the moment in the first scene when a phone call takes detective Jeb Pyre (Andrew Garfield) away from his two young daughters, there’s a sense that Something Bad is coming, that each step forward will sink deeper into darkness. There’s that first horrific step down in the second scene, as Pyre recoils at a vicious crime scene. Director David Mackenzie’s camera spares you the bodies but not the blood – smeared on the phone, handprinted on the door, puddled on the kitchen floor. The seven-part limited series, created by Oscar-winning screenwriter Dustin Lance Black (Milk), follows the investigation into who slashed the throats of 24-year-old Brenda Lafferty (Normal People’s Daisy Edgar-Jones) and her 15-month-old daughter in July 1984. But it also offers a steady stream of evermore disturbing revelations: the perversion of religious fundamentalism, the silence of religious institutions who choose pride over truth and, less effectively, the history of violence within the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, more commonly known as Mormonism. The real-life murders of Brenda and Erica are no mystery, and thus the show is not a whodunnit like HBO’s similarly bleak Mare of Easttown. Krakauer’s book investigated how gruesome violence could be committed in the name of faith, and how the LDS church obscured its ties to the fundamentalist groups that splintered following the church’s official ban on polygamy in 1890. (Krakauer had no official role on the TV series.) Black, who was raised Mormon, casts a similarly harsh and probing light on the LDS church, both in the specifics to this case (an unwillingness to help Pyre’s investigation – the Laffertys, we’re told, were “Utah Kennedys”) and the conservative faith’s general subjugation of women. The series attempts to translate Krakauer’s sweeping book through the overused prestige TV trop of multiple timelines. In the first – and by far most successful – of the three storylines, Pyre and his partner, detective Bill Taba (Yellowstone’s Gil Birmingham) peel back the rotten layers in the murder case through interrogations with the younger Lafferty brothers: Brenda’s distraught yet inscrutable widower Allen (Billy Howle), reticent Robin (Seth Numrich) and off-the-grid fundamentalist Sam (Rory Culkin). Taba, a Native American of Paiute heritage, offers a skeptical, hardened foil to Pyre’s pious good cop – and a reminder, both in presence and in dialogue, that he’s the only character with brown skin in the “99% white town” of American Fork, Utah. The second, confusingly jumbled timeline follows Brenda’s uncomfortable fit into the Lafferty family – she’s an aspiring journalist from less conservative Idaho, they’re Utah Mormon stalwarts with an ugly history of abuse by terrifying patriarch Ammon (Christopher Heyerdahl). The brunt of his violent anger falls on eldest sons Ron (Sam Worthington, with the wobbliest accent in a cast of primarily non-American actors) and Dan (an unnerving Wyatt Russell), whose repeated humiliations seem to undergird a vague slide into anti-tax libertarianism, spousal abuse and eventually polygamy. By far the least successful storyline depicts Mormonism’s early days under founder Joseph Smith – himself a polygamist, although the LDS church did not admit this until 2014. Whatever support the Mormon historical record lent to Krakauer’s analysis in the book doesn’t translate here; the 19th century scenes – stark, hokey, mostly sans historical context – resemble budget History Channel re-enactments and do almost nothing to enhance the later stories. They’re jarring and unnecessary distractions to the much more nuanced, taut later timelines, not least because they require awkward narration from the present-day characters – particularly poor Allen, also tasked with explaining Brenda to us. Which is a shame, because the modern scenes of characters torn between their faith and their morals could easily stand on their own. With his baby face and mostly smooth American accent, Garfield is more than convincing as a buttoned-up church guy fraying under the weight of cognitive dissonance – the gap between what he believes (that man is the authority of the household, that the church is the ultimate authority) and what he knows (that his wife is his equal, that Brenda and Erica deserve justice). Edgar-Jones, too, captures this – some form of unbreakable spirit – in her heartbreaking portrayal of Brenda, a faithful Mormon and nascent feminist. At its best, the series digs into the always fascinating and confusing tension between instinct and instruction – how people see right when they’re told wrong, how people feel pulled to the truth. How beliefs molt and mutate. When that question gets center stage, the show becomes something more than a competent if muddled entry into the dead girls oeuvre. As a whole, the series is almost always discomforting, relentlessly ominous and occasionally nauseating. (Warning: if you, like me, find dog suffering/death to be unbearable, the second episode will be tough.) I don’t know if you can say it’s something inherently rotten about the LDS church, as the show sometimes seems to argue; what’s clear is that the church – an institution that secretly amassed a $100bn war chest – is more protective of its reputation than its people, like many other large institutions.

4/29/2022,"Good morning. Anthony Albanese is due to rejoin the campaign trail after seven days of Covid isolation. The Labor leader will fly to Perth on Friday ahead of the party’s campaign launch on the weekend. Scott Morrison will be in Hobart, after announcing $50m for the Nyrstar smelter in the Tasmanian capital. A majority of voters agree with key Labor campaign messages that Scott Morrison is “all announcement no delivery”, a new poll reveals. In further bad news for the government, Labor’s claim it will “put the care back into aged care” is also resonating well ahead of election day. The poll of 1,000 voters, commissioned by the progressive thinktank the Australia Institute, also found Coalition claims about handling of the economy are testing well, but overall it was Labor’s messaging that was hitting the mark. Meanwhile, two of Labor’s star candidates in must-win marginal electorates have advocated strongly for an increase to the jobseeker payment, contradicting the party’s decision to scrap its planned review of the benefit if it wins government. Russia attacked western Kyiv with two cruise missiles on Thursday evening, as the UN secretary general, António Guterres, visited the Ukrainian capital. Ukrainian officials were quick to underline the extraordinary timing of the attack, saying it was hard to see it as anything other than Moscow mocking the UN. Meanwhile, US president, Joe Biden, has called for a giant $33bn package of military and economic aid to Ukraine, more than doubling the level of US assistance to date. Wholesale power prices in Australia’s main electricity market continued to rise in the first three months of 2022, more than doubling the cost a year earlier, with the increase blamed mostly on more costly fossil fuels and the falling reliability of coal-fired power plants. The leap in wholesale power prices is beginning to feed into the bills sent to households and businesses. Extra costs will also stoke the highest consumer price inflation since the introduction of the GST more than 20 years ago. The Queensland and federal governments are trading blows over the state’s housing after another report on the crisis from the Queensland Council of Social Services (Qcoss), which said more than 50,000 households are currently on the waiting list for social housing. One Nation has divided its support between the major parties on how-to-vote cards, saying the move is in retaliation for Liberals’ decision to preference the Jacqui Lambie Network in Tasmania. Party leader, Pauline Hanson, revealed the plan on Thursday, directing supporters to preference Labor in at least five seats while helping the Coalition in the north Queensland seat of Leichhardt and Braddon in Tasmania. The wet weather that has triggered record floods and filled dams across much of eastern Australia looks set to extend well into winter and beyond, global models indicate. After two La Niñas in two years in the Pacific – a pattern that sees strengthening easterly winds pushing rainfall towards Australia – the landscape “is a bit more primed for flooding” than a year ago. Debut writer Evelyn Araluen has won the $60,000 Stella prize for her collection Dropbear, which she wrote while “one paycheck away from complete poverty”. She is the first poet to win Australia’s literary award for women and non-binary writers, in the first year poetry was allowed to enter. The UN secretary general has described the war in Ukraine as “an absurdity” in the 21st century, on a visit to the scene of civilian killings outside Kyiv. “I imagine my family in one of those houses that is now destroyed and black,” said António Guterres, who has been criticised for visiting Ukraine only after having first met Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, in Moscow. Chinese authorities have said they are cracking down on price gouging as food shortages due to Shanghai’s lockdown continue and fears in Beijing prompt a run on supermarkets. On Wednesday, the ministry of public security pledged any individuals taking advantage of outbreaks to make a profit would be dealt with strictly, with fines of up to 3m yuan (A$637,400). A Samsung advertisement featuring a woman jogging alone at 2am has been criticised as “unrealistic” and “tone deaf”, coming after the death of 23-year-old Ashling Murphy, who was attacked while out running along a canal near Tullamore, west of Dublin, earlier this year. Pristine rainforests were once again destroyed at a relentless rate in 2021, according to new figures, prompting concerns governments will not meet a Cop26 deal to halt and reverse deforestation by the end of the decade. “If I actually am friendly, what other stories about myself could be true?” ponders Sinéad Stubbins, after an encounter with a friendly person has a profound effect on how she sees herself. “It’s peculiar that we think certain elements about ourselves are set in stone, even if there’s no real evidence to suggest that. Maybe these stories that we carry, like heavy trunks full of memories, can become outdated – or maybe they were never really true in the first place.” Yuki Kihara celebrates Samoa’s third gender in an interview with Jinghua Qian. Her show Paradise Camp comprises 12 tableau photographs that offer a winking response to the paintings of French post-impressionist Paul Gauguin and a wry comment on tourism and the climate crisis. Prominent in every element of the show are fa’afafine – a Sāmoan term that literally means “in the manner of a woman” and refers to third gender people in both the singular and plural. Make or Break’s behind-the-scenes look at the World Surf League engages fans and non-fans alike, even if some hard questions remain ignored, writes Kieran Pender. There is a moment early in the first episode when Tyler Wright neatly encapsulates the tension at the heart of professional surfing. “We come from a sport of, ‘aww we’re hippies’,” says the Australian surfer, a two-time WSL champion. “We’re not. We’re competitive little assholes.” New inflation figures show the largest annual rises since the introduction of the GST. The consumer prices index hit 5.1% annually. The numbers tell a clear story: Australians are struggling – struggling to afford groceries and petrol, and to keep a roof over their heads. In today’s episode of Full Story, Gabrielle Jackson talks to Lenore Taylor and Mike Ticher about why we aren’t hearing from the people most affected by massive price hikes and low wage rises and whether it will influence the election campaign.

4/29/2022,"As first taste of European semi-finals go, this barnstorming match will surely have whet the appetite of Leicester. Ademola Lookman bundled in a second-half equaliser via Gianluca Mancini to cancel out Roma’s early opener and ensure a grandstand finish in the second leg of this Europa Conference League contest at the enormous Stadio Olimpico next Thursday, leaving José Mourinho frustrated on his return to England. The Portuguese had reeled off eight of Leicester’s attacking threats in the buildup to this game and his stubborn side eventually wilted. Brendan Rodgers had eulogised about Mourinho’s influence on his career during their three years together at Chelsea and, after taking the opportunity to catch up, the Leicester manager handed his opposite number a bottle of red. “He got me the best Portuguese bottle of wine,” Mourinho said. “He’s crying because it’s really expensive, but he wanted to give me my favourite bottle of Portuguese wine. It is really hard to find. I don’t know how he found it, but I know how he paid.” The tie is finely poised but it was the kind of evening when both managers were able to smile. Mourinho is adamant Roma’s home advantage for the “final date” will help to propel them to the final and Rodgers was effusive in his praise of his youthful team’s performance, with James Maddison, Wesley Fofana and Lookman lively on Jamie Vardy’s return to the starting lineup. “The winner of the Roma final has to win the Albanian final,” Mourinho said, referring to the competition’s final next month in Tirana. “For us it makes a difference to play at home with 70,000 [fans].” For all Leicester’s early promise, Roma ruthlessly punished them with their first clean sight of goal on 15 minutes. The bubbly wing-back Nicola Zalewski surged upfield on a meandering run and after driving inside he spied the run of his captain, Lorenzo Pellegrini, who rattled a shot through the legs of the Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel. In the dugout Mourinho, silver hair, grey long coat, was unmoved, steadfastly jotting down a note or two. It was not always the way, however, and the former Tottenham manager was soon crouching on the touchline, contorting himself as he cajoled his players into shape or skipping out of his technical area to deliver instructions. Vardy and Timothy Castagne, who departed after 21 minutes with a head injury, fashioned early chances but Tammy Abraham, one of two Englishmen in the Roma starting lineup along with Chris Smalling, freed Nicolò Zaniolo before Fofana intervened. Mourinho’s 25 titles (25 and a half, if you ask him, given he was sacked six days before Tottenham reached the Carabao Cup final last year) were crammed into the honours list in the match-day programme and how Leicester, who sent PSV packing in the previous round, crave more of these nights. Fofana occasionally took matters into his own hands, gracefully flowing forward from centre-back, and Smalling made a superb sliding block to prevent Lookman getting a clear shot at goal after he was threaded through by Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall. Vardy lasted an hour on his return before being replaced by Kelechi Iheanacho but another substitute, Harvey Barnes, was the catalyst for Leicester’s leveller. Chances had been at a premium but Barnes poured forward into a dangerous position at the byline after the Roma centre-back Roger Ibañez, trying to shield the ball from Iheanacho, inadvertently played a one-two with the Leicester winger. Barnes sent a cross into the six-yard box and Lookman was there to help it in with some help from Mancini. This stadium was now rocking but Rodgers was a picture of calm, sipping a bottle of water. Feyenoord edged Marseille 3-2 in a pulsating clash in Rotterdam, letting a two-goal lead slip before rallying to win and take a slender advantage into next Thursday's second leg on the French south coast. Feyenoord scored twice in as many minutes early in the first half to take the upper hand in their tie at De Kuip. Cyriel Dessers (pictured) and Luis Sinisterra provided the reward for a positive start in which the hosts mounted wave after wave of attacks. But Marseille pulled a goal back with a thunderous strike from 25 metres from Bamba Dieng that flew past Ofir Marciano at his near post in the 28th minute and they were level before the break as the keeper could only parry Matteo Guendouzi's cross to Gerson, who finished from 10 yards out. Dessers put Feyenoord back in front straight after the break as Duje Caleta-Car left his back pass to keeper Steve Mandanda short and the Nigeria international stole in to score and give the Dutch side the advantage ahead of their trip to France. Reuters Iheanacho forced the former Wolves goalkeeper Rui Patrício to tip round a post and Schmeichel made an acrobatic stop to deny Sérgio Oliveira at the other end a couple of minutes later. Maddison’s cross then took a wicked deflection and a pulsating tie will resume next week. “I said to the players afterwards: ‘Look at the performance level,’” Rodgers said. “We had no fear; we can go to Rome and play to that level. We’re in with a fantastic chance to get to the final.”",Sport/Football,Leicester hit back at Roma to take shine off José Mourinho’s return to England,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/28/leicester-roma-europa-conference-league-semi-final-first-leg-match-report
4/29/2022,"Sam Kerr’s reply 72 seconds after Kerys Harrop’s improbable equaliser ensured Chelsea remain on course to retain the league title after navigating tricky back-to-back games against Tottenham. Kerr’s goal just before half-time to restore the lead, after Harrop cancelled out Beth England’s header, earned Chelsea victory in a second gritty encounter with Spurs. The win means the Blues have moved four points clear of Arsenal, albeit having played a game more, with two games left to play – at Birmingham then at home to Manchester United. “I think the game was comfortable, but because we didn’t get the third goal they were always in it,” said Chelsea’s manager Emma Hayes. “Right now it’s just getting the three points and on to the next one.” Spurs’ early lead and the sending off of the goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger had hinted at Chelsea’s fallibility on Sunday. Then, a gruelling and passion-fuelled comeback at the Hive to earn a 3-1 win underlined their resilience. Back on home turf Chelsea were brutally efficient, harrying and pressing with an intensity that had been missing from the first half in north London. Hayes made four changes to the starting XI for this game. With Berger suspended, the Swedish goalkeeper Zecira Musovic came in, while the captain Magda Eriksson, the Danish striker Pernille Harder and the full-back Jonna Andersson, who all came off the bench as Chelsea swung the game around four days earlier, were also called back in. For Tottenham, there was an enforced change too, with the influential Ash Neville suspended after picking up her fifth yellow of the season and young Asmita Ale favoured in her absence at right-back. With close to 20 minutes played Chelsea took a deserved lead when a short corner to Andersson, who provided the assist for Kerr’s goal on Sunday straight after coming on, was swung into the middle for England to nod down and in. Despite the superiority of Hayes’s side, Tottenham would stun the hosts with one minute left of the half when a free-kick from the Australian forward Kyah Simon was turned in by the head of Harrop. There is something about the character of these Chelsea players that means they always bite back harder, and Spurs had just poked the bear. From the restart, Sophie Ingle sent the ball wide to Harder who delicately flicked it and turned past Harrop before sending a cross that Kerr would rise to meet and put Chelsea ahead against Tottenham for the second time in less than a week. If the Tottenham manager, Rehanne Skinner, had been able to legitimately lament defeat on Sunday, there could be no such reflection on this encounter on the far slicker and more comfortable grass of Kingsmeadow. With just over one minute between Harrop’s header and Kerr’s reply, Spurs’ fightback was over as quickly as it had begun. Central to Chelsea’s dominance was Harder who, playing wide but operating fluidly in combination with Kerr and England, pulled the strings, creating space and tracking back in equal measure. Spurs would go close once more, as Rosella Ayane curled the ball in from the edge of the box but Musovic read the flight of the ball and tipped it over. Chelsea would almost score, with Erin Cuthbert driving forward before rattling a powerful shot off the base of the post. Then Kerr collected Cuthbert’s looped pass and squeezed the ball between Tinja-Riikka Korpela and the near post only to be incorrectly flagged offside. “I was onside? Dang, should have 19 [in the league this season] then eh,” said Kerr with a grin. “It is what it is, no one cares who scores in this team, it’s about getting the job done, the defenders do what they do and I do what I do.” She was right, it mattered little, two games, two wins and Chelsea will secure the title. There is no added pressure though. “You know what, we were talking about it before the game, it’s the same as last year, we were two points off City,” said Kerr. “One point, two points, it’s just one game, we’re in exactly the same position – and we play for Chelsea, we love this stuff.”",Sport/Football,England and Kerr fire Chelsea to win over Tottenham and stretch WSL lead,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/28/chelsea-tottenham-womens-super-league-match-report
4/29/2022,"In the end the only consolation for West Ham was that they are still in the tie. The damage could have been more severe. Eintracht Frankfurt were superior for long spells and, as David Moyes picks through a messy performance from his team, he will feel relieved that West Ham will have a chance of reaching the Europa League final when they travel to Germany next week. There is much for a naive West Ham to improve before the second leg. Eintracht picked them off at will at times and should have departed the London Stadium with more than a 2-1 lead. It would have been undeserved if West Ham, whose goal came from Michail Antonio, had equalised when Jarrod Bowen’s overhead kick struck the bar in stoppage time. It meant so much to both sides to have come this far. There was no sense of ennui in the stands; no sense of anyone taking this for granted. After all, younger West Ham fans had never seen anything like this before. This was their side’s first European semi-final since 1976 – through a strange quirk of fate, that was also against Frankfurt – and it was not a surprise to find the ground packed long before kick-off, the hairs on the back of the neck standing to attention when the home fans launched into a rousing rendition of I’m Forever Blowing Bubbles a the teams emerged. Yet Frankfurt were never going to be overawed after stunning Barcelona in the previous round. The visitors were backed by a large travelling contingent and, more importantly, were not short of confidence on the pitch. There was a crispness to Oliver Glasner’s side, trouble flaring when Daichi Kamada had possession, and the early signs were ominous for West Ham, who could not have imagined that they would be behind with less than a minute on the clock. Admittedly it was a beautifully worked goal from the Germans. The move began with Kamada drifting down the left and West Ham were slow to react when the ball reached Rafael Borré. The striker had too much time to turn and when Borré sent a lovely curling cross in behind Pablo Fornals at the far post it was almost as if he knew Angsar Knauff would be there, hurtling in from right wing-back to meet the delivery with a header that left Alphonse Areola rooted to the spot. West Ham, who were boosted by Kurt Zouma returning from injury to partner Craig Dawson in central defence, looked shocked. For a while they could not do anything right. Too many passes went astray and there were times when Frankfurt, who were posing problems thanks to their enterprising 3-4-2-1 system, looked likely to extend their lead. Gradually, though, West Ham began to impose themselves. Declan Rice began to win his tackles in midfield. Antonio began to use his strength up front, which forced Frankfurt to think twice and move their defence back a few yards. The equaliser should have arrived when Antonio combined with Tomas Soucek, who sent Bowen racing clear through the middle. His low finish looked good enough, only for Kevin Trapp guide the shot on to the left post. Yet it was encouraging for West Ham and it was not a surprise when they drew level. They had a height advantage over Eintracht, who were missing the influential Kristijan Jakic and Evan Ndicka through suspension, and the visitors cracked when Manuel Lanzini lifted a free-kick to the far post in the 21st minute. There was no challenge on Zouma and Antonio bundled a volley past Trapp. Finally the tension was lifted, Antonio threatening to score again after an error from Almamy Touré, though Frankfurt remained menacing on the break. At times West Ham’s players did not seem to know who to pick up. Borré kept dropping deep to pick up possession between the lines and it was hard not to feel for Aaron Cresswell as the left-back strained to keep up Knauff, who kept making the same angled run and almost restored Eintracht’s lead when he fired inches over after another slick counterattack. It was uncomfortable for West Ham. Eintracht simply had more to them. Their movement was too quick, the interplay too sharp West Ham could not cope and they were behind again when Djibril Sow surged through midfield after 54 minutes, burst clear after a one-two with Jesper Lindstrøm and tried to place a low finish past Areola, who parried the ball into the path of Kamada and watched helplessly as the midfielder put the rebound away. West Ham had it all to do by the end. While Saïd Benrahma went close with a bending effort after replacing Lanzini, an equaliser rarely felt likely. More precision was required in the final third. Too many promising positions went to waste and there were howls from the crowd when Benrahma fired over with Antonio unmarked in the middle. It summed up West Ham’s night, although they did enjoy a huge escape when Kamada’s deflected shot hit the woodwork. At least they still have hope before the second leg.",Sport/Football,West Ham face uphill task after Kamada rewards Eintracht Frankfurt dominance,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/28/west-ham-eintracht-frankfurt-europa-league-match-report
