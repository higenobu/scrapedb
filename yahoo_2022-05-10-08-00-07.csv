5/10/2022,"Loved-up prison guard Vicky White and her jailhouse beau Casey White have been caught after an extraordinary 11 days on the run, officials in Indiana and Florida confirmed Monday evening. “We’ve captured them,” Vanderburgh County Sheriff Dave Wedding told WAAY 31, adding that they were involved in a crash after a police pursuit. Vicky White, 56, was taken to a hospital with a self-inflicted gunshot wound, while 38-year-old Casey White, no relation, surrendered and was taken into custody, the outlet reported. When asked if it was surprising that Vicky had pulled the trigger, rather than her roadtrip buddy, a hardened criminal with a reported death wish, Wedding mused: “With criminals and criminal minds, they are very unpredictable. We don’t take anything they say with merit and they can change on a dime.” The pair were found in Evansville, Indiana, just five hours’ drive from the Florence, Alabama, prison they’d vanished from. Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton, Vicky’s former boss, confirmed their capture. “We got a dangerous man off the street today,” Singleton said at a news conference. “He is never going to see the light of day again.” It appears the pair were eventually undone by a stolen car. Late last week, investigators found Vicky’s rust-colored SUV in a tow yard after the Whites abandoned it off an interstate near Bethesda, Tennessee. Authorities said another car, a black Ford pickup truck, was reported stolen in the same area around the same time. Investigators then tracked that stolen car to Evansville, about 100 miles north of Bethesda, on Monday. It appears the duo tried to evade police initially before they overturned the truck and were caught. Casey had been driving, according to Singleton. End of police chase — Evansville, Indiana.

But they never arrived, instead driving Vicky’s patrol car to a shopping mall 10 minutes away, then jumping into the rust-colored Ford Edge SUV that Vicky had bought days earlier using a fake identity. “You don’t know who you can trust,” Singleton told reporters. “You know, I had every bit of trust in Vicky White. She had been an exemplary employee. And what in the world provoked her, or prompted her, to pull something like this, I don’t know. I don’t know if we’ll ever know.” Casey, a hulking 6-foot-9 inmate decorated with white supremacist tattoos, was serving 75 years for, among other things, attempting to kill an ex-girlfriend and killing a dog. He was also awaiting trial for murdering another woman. It was not immediately clear if Vicky would survive her wounds. “I hope she survives this,” Singleton said. “... She has some answers to give us.” More to come… Read more at The Daily Beast. Get the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox. Sign up now.

5/10/2022,"A capital murder suspect and a corrections officer who allegedly helped him escape from an Alabama jail last month are in custody, authorities said Monday. Casey White, 38, and Vicky White, 56, were captured after a pursuit with authorities in Indiana ended in a wreck, Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton told reporters. ""This has ended a very long, stressful, challenging week and a half,"" Singleton said. Casey White surrendered to police after the wreck, Singleton said. Vicky White was taken to a hospital for unspecified injuries. Singleton said the nature of her injures remained clear. The pair were taken into custody after Casey White was seen on security camera washing a Ford F-150 truck in Evansville, Indiana. The business owner provided authorities with security camera images and the agency confirmed they showed White, the Marshals Service said. Officials have said that he had a ""special relationship"" with Vicky White, 56, a former employee of the Lauderdale County Jail. Authorities have said she helped Casey White escape on her final day at work. Vicky White was not seen in the photos from the car wash. A warrant for her arrest was issued earlier this month for allegedly facilitating or permitting Casey White's April 29 escape.

5/10/2022,"The Cobb County Sheriff’s Office has officially charged a Georgia sheriff accused of groping a prominent former judge. Prosecutors said former Bleckley County Sheriff Kris Coody groped Judge Glenda Hatchett at a sheriff’s convention earlier this year. Channel 2′s Cobb County Bureau Chief Michele Newell spoke to Thomas Brown, the former sheriff of DeKalb County, who is listed as a witness to the incident. Brown said he’s not just a witness, but had to physically intervene. [DOWNLOAD: Free WSB-TV News app for alerts as news breaks] Brown said that remembering that day brings back many unsettling feelings. Brown said that Hatchett was his guest at the conference, and that Coody groped Hatchett as he was introducing her to sheriffs at the Renaissance Atlanta Waverly Bar. Brown said three sheriffs came to the standup table, including Coody and the president of the Georgia Sheriff’s Association. Brown said he turned his head away from Coody and Hatchett as they were talking. “As I turned to my left to focus back on the two of them, I saw his hand go down on her left breast,” Brown said. “I grabbed his arm threw it off of her chest and basically said, ‘What are you (adjective) think you’re doing?’ and that’s basically where it ended.” TRENDING STORIES: Shooter on the run after 6 shot, 3 killed at DeKalb condo complex Man shot several times in broad daylight road rage shooting, Brookhaven police say Investigators on scene of officer-involved shooting in Atlanta Brown said he was so angry that his first reaction was to do more than take his hand off of her. “She was there as my guest, so I was obviously upset,” Brown said. “Obviously mad. He was obviously intoxicated.” Brown said Hatchett told him the incident shocked her. “After that, she had a rough time of it,” Brown said. [SIGN UP: WSB-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter] Brown said he immediately removed Hatchett from the room and had a stern conversation with Coody the next day. Coody has since been charged with sexual battery. Channel 2 Action News is only identifying Hackett as the victim because she wanted her story told. “She’s very passionate about telling her story at some point in time, if for no other reason, for the hundreds or ladies out there who may have been victims of some time of sexual assault, but have not said anything because they are afraid to do so,” Brown said. Newell tried contacting Coody, but he wasn’t available. Channel 2 Action News did receive a statement from the sheriff’s office and Coody after he turned himself in. Coody said he takes the charges seriously and will comply with all legal obligations placed on him. Coody said that while it would be improper to contact Hatchett, he looked forward to personally expressing his regrets for an offense at the appropriate time. Brown said he was going public with the story because he wants the judicial system to be respected. “I felt like I needed to say something, because the accusation is now out. It’s unsealed,” Brown said. “The judge had no problems with it being unsealed, because she’s a lot stronger now.”",U.S./WSB Cox articles,Georgia sheriff charged with sexual battery after groping prominent Atlanta judge,https://news.yahoo.com/georgia-sheriff-charged-sexual-battery-213317880.html
5/10/2022,"A recent survey conducted by Fox News indicates the majority of Republicans have negative views of immigrants.

In the new poll, jointly developed by Democratic political data firm Beacon Research and Republican polling firm Shaw & Company Research, participants were asked, “In general, do you think immigrants who come to the United States today help the country and make it a better place to live or hurt the country and make it a worse place to live?”

Overall, 45% of all respondents said immigrants “help the country and make it a better place to live,” notably down from 51% in 2018. By political party, 71% of Democrats and 22% of Republicans affirmed this belief.

Meanwhile, 39% of all respondents said they believe immigrants “hurt the country and make it a worse place to live.” This belief was supported by 59% of Republicans and 21% of Democrats.

Independent responses were closer to the overall results, with 44% who believe immigrants “help” and 30% who believe they “hurt.”

Among Republicans, 54% of men and 64% of women believed immigrants hurt the country. Other demographics that reflected a high level of agreement included Trump voters at 60% and white women without a degree at 55%. Just under half of white men without a degree (49%) responded that immigrants had a negative impact.

The survey, which mainly asked questions focused on Americans’ satisfaction with Biden’s performance as president, was conducted by phone between April 28-May 1 and sampled 1,003 registered voters across the country.

Among all respondents, Biden received approval from 45% (83% of Democrats, 11% of Republicans), while 53% (15% of Democrats, 88% of Republicans) said they disapprove.

5/10/2022,"Russia’s Typhoon-class submarines were true Cold War leviathans. The missile-firing submarines were designed to operate in the Arctic under pack ice. A typical Typhoon was more than 1.5 times longer than a football field and three times as tall as the average American house. If you’ve ever seen The Hunt for Red October, you’re probably familiar with Russia’s truly massive Typhoon-class submarines. These Cold War giants still stand as the largest subs ever built. Just how big are we talking? Each u-boat stretched to nearly 600 feet long and was wider than the average American house—and almost three times as tall, to boot. In the 1970s, the Soviet Union embarked upon a new nuclear weapons program (code name: Typhoon) to develop a new missile-firing submarine and nuclear missiles. The subs (code name: Akula) were designed to be 566 feet long, 76 feet wide, and nearly 38 feet tall. The Typhoon-class submarines displaced 23,200 tons in order to accommodate a payload of 20 RSM-52 ballistic missiles. Although most subs are relatively spartan in amenities, the sheer size of the Typhoons made it possible for engineers at St. Petersburg’s Rubin Design Bureau to squeeze in such unprecedented perks as a solarium, swimming pool, and sauna. The first submarine in the Typhoon class, Dmitri Donskoy (TK-208), entered service in 1981. Russia built five Typhoons in total, but today, only Donskoy remains in service. The sub has spent its post-Cold War career as a test bed for a new generation of Russian submarine technologies and missiles, and was instrumental in testing the buggy Bulava submarine-launched ballistic missile. The images directly above and below, which undersea warfare authority H.I. Sutton created, show the Typhoon in relation to the American Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines and the average American house. While the Typhoon-class subs are only 17 feet longer than the Ohio boats, they’re considerably wider and taller. A Typhoon sub looks so menacing because its sail (also known as the conning tower) is located behind the missile silos instead of in front of them, meaning the missiles are always included in any picture of the sub. The titular Red October was supposed to be a fictional super-variant of the Typhoon class, equipped with six more RSM-52 missiles for a total of 52,000 kilotons of nuclear firepower. (The atomic bomb exploded at Hiroshima, by comparison, had a yield of 16 kilotons.) Red October came packed with a magnetohydrodynamic drive (MHD) system, a real-life propulsion system that supposedly gave the ship a first-strike capability. In both The Hunt for Red October and the novel it was based on, the sub was designed to use its near-silent MHD propulsion to sneak to a position off the eastern seaboard of the U.S., launching its missiles in a surprise attack. This unadvertised capability was the final straw for ship captain Marko Ramius, who defects with his submarine to the U.S. Today, a newer generation of Russian missile submarines, the Borei class, are replacing the Russian Navy’s aging Typhoon- and Delta-class subs. The Borei-class subs carry 16 Bulava missiles for a total explosive yield of 7,200 kilotons, though the Bulava missiles are likely much more accurate than their predecessors. And since the Boreis are smaller and more space-efficient than their ancestors, they probably don’t have swimming pools. Russia plans to build at least eight Borei submarines, split between the Northern (Atlantic) and Pacific Fleets. At 40 years old, Dmitri Donskoy is nearing retirement age. The Soviets built the Typhoon boats during a time before computers and compact ballistic missiles, and their size was dictated in large part by their enormous RSM-52 missiles. There may never be a class of submarines as big as the Typhoons ... though never say never.
