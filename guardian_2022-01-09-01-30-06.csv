1/9/2022,"A snow leopard at a zoo in Bloomington, Illinois, has died after contracting Covid-19.  Miller Park Zoo announced the death of Rilu, 11, which the zoo previously said “began coughing and had a raspy respiration beginning on 20 November”, in an Instagram post on Thursday. Noting the animal’s spectacular tail, which was almost as long as its body, the zoo said Rilu produced seven offspring which are now part of its Species Survival Plan. “Rilu’s personality and beauty will be missed by guests and staff but he will not be forgotten,” said superintendent Jay Tetzloff, adding that masks are required in all indoor spaces at the Bloomington zoo. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most animal Covid infections come from contact with humans “including owners, caretakers or others in close contact”. Among animals vulnerable to Covid, the CDC lists companion animals including cats, dogs and ferrets; several types of big cats; otters; non-human primates; binturong; coati-mundi; fishing cats; hyenas; mink; and wild white-tailed deer. The photographer Joel Sartore, whose image of Rilu accompanied the announcement of the animal’s death, paid tribute in his own post. “Snow leopards are proving extremely susceptible to the disease and it’s often fatal,” Sartore said. “If you haven’t received a vaccination and booster yet, please do so. It’s more than just human lives that are at stake. Thank you.” In December, three snow leopards at the Lincoln Children’s Zoo in Nebraska died of complications from Covid-19. Two Sumatran tigers recovered. In July, zoos in Oakland and Denver announced they would start vaccinating tigers, bears and other mammals with a two-dose vaccine first administered in March to gorillas in San Diego. Zoetis, a New Jersey animal health company, has said it has donated more than 11,000 vaccine doses to almost 70 zoos and wildlife sanctuaries, as part of an effort authorised by the US Department of Agriculture. In December, two hippos at a zoo in Antwerp, Belgium, tested positive for Covid-19. Imani, 14, and Hermien, 41, showed no symptoms “other than runny noses”, the zoo said. Francis Vercammen, a zoo vet, told CNN: “To my knowledge, this is the first known contamination in this species.”",News/US news,Snow leopard at Illinois zoo dies after contracting Covid-19,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/08/snow-leopard-dies-covid-19-illinois-zoo
1/9/2022,"Record house prices, cheap mortgages, a stamp duty holiday and the “race for space” during the pandemic have meant huge rewards for UK housebuilders, Taylor Wimpey included. In the first half of 2021, the UK’s third-largest housebuilder finished a record number of homes, returned to profit, and upgraded forecasts for the full year, the results for which it will publish in March.  But the company has become the latest target of unwanted attention from US activist investor Elliott Advisors, which has also picked battles with the Argentinian government, mining giant BHP and Britain’s second-biggest drugmaker, GSK, among others. A month ago, the New York hedge fund went public with its demands on Taylor Wimpey, revealing in a nine-page public letter to Taylor Wimpey chair Irene Dorner that it was one of the company’s top five investors and wanted the housebuilder to find a new chief executive from outside the organisation. In typical fashion, Elliott was scathing about Taylor Wimpey’s current leadership’s “operational and strategic missteps,” and called for an experienced external candidate to succeed Pete Redfern as chief executive. The letter came a few days after Redfern announced he would be stepping down in 2022 after 15 years at the helm (he denied that the decision was prompted by pressure from Elliott). In 2006, Redfern became the youngest FTSE 100 chief executive when, at 37, he took charge of George Wimpey and led a merger with rival Taylor Woodrow the following year. Taylor Wimpey says it is at an advanced stage in its search for a replacements, looking at internal and external candidates, including from outside the housebuilding sector. Elliott is pushing for it to choose someone from within the industry and is thought to prefer either Crest Nicholson chief Peter Truscott, who previously ran Galliford Try and also spent 30 years at Taylor Wimpey; former Persimmon boss Dave Jenkinson, who quit last year in a row over build quality (and after a controversial £45m payout); and Barratt deputy chief executive and chief operating officer Steven Boyes. Analysts say Truscott is the most likely to get the job. From within Taylor Wimpey, another strong candidate is group operations director Jennie Daly, who has long been talked about as a possible successor to Redfern. “She has lots of experience in strategic land [buying] and planning, which is the lifeblood of housebuilding,” said Anthony Codling, chief executive of property firm Twindig. “She’d also bring a great deal of operational expertise.” If appointed, Daly would be the only female chief executive of a major housebuilder; Dorner is the only female chair in a male-dominated industry. There was speculation that Jeff Fairburn, the Persimmon boss ousted after a public outcry over his proposed £110m bonus, was also being lined up for the job at Taylor Wimpey, as Elliott had also backed the takeover of east Midlands-based Avant Homes by Berkeley DeVeer, a builder controlled by Fairburn, last April. However, Avant and Fairburn swiftly denied that he had any interest in the job. Analysts said Elliott was attracted to Taylor Wimpey because of Britain’s housing shortage and the firm’s hidden potential, including its land bank, but some believed it needed to improve its operational performance. Its shares have fallen by a quarter since February 2020. Clyde Lewis of Peel Hunt said: “Elliott has some valid points. Of the major housebuilders, TW has probably been the quietest in the past few years. Persimmon has gone through a lot of management change; Barratt has made more progress in terms of strategy and margins. TW hasn’t evolved much. There’s probably a modest amount of support [behind Elliott] from other investors.” In its criticism of Taylor Wimpey, Elliott cited its “failed large-sites strategy”, which it said had led to cost overruns and sale-price erosion in 2019, as well as the £500m fund-raising and £1.7bn splurge on new land in summer 2020. It noted that the firm had suffered the sector’s biggest decline in housebuilding volumes in 2020, with a 39% drop compared with Barratt at 29% and Persimmon at 14%. The company has defended its record, noting that it was the first major builder to shut all its sites when the pandemic first hit. The housebuilder has pointed to its record first-half profits for 2021 and its upgraded forecasts for the full year. It also said that the equity increase enabled it to snap up land at low prices, investing for the future in the hope of reaping stronger growth in 2023. Despite all that, Elliott looks to be shaping up for its next fight.",News/Business,Taylor Wimpey shores up defences against US activist investor,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/08/taylor-wimpey-shores-up-defences-against-us-activist-investor
1/9/2022,"Whoever gives out music awards should hand one to the German label Analog Africa, which has spent the past decade uncovering lost delights from the continent’s output during the 1960s to 1980s, when few people aside from those who lived there were tuning in to the sounds of West Africa and beyond, Nigeria’s Fela Kuti providing one of the few exceptions. Hot on the heels of Cameroon Garage Funk, this collection – as ever, charmingly presented with in-depth research – focuses on Ghana, whose highlife music was the wellspring for much African output. Its title salutes the Essiebons label of producer Dick Essilfie-Bondzie, who died aged 90 midway through the album’s compilation, but not before unearthing some unreleased gems. By the mid-70s, highlife’s jazzy roots had become entangled with the sound of Black America to create a funk-heavy hybrid with lots of stuttering guitars, James Brown declamations and meandering organ parts – a genre captured on tracks by scene-shakers such as Ernest Honny and CK Mann, whose Yeaba is a standout. Odder moments feature the proto-synths of the time; Joe Meah’s Ahwene Pa Nkasa typifies an appetite for psych-heavy weirdness. A surprising trip to an altogether other time and place.

1/9/2022,"Tessa Hadley walks into the sitting room of a hotel in London’s West End that is a pleasant mixture of Christmassy, deserted and library-quiet – a welcome side-effect of the pandemic. At 65, she has an eager, intelligent, girlish face and an elegant angularity (I’ve not seen her handwriting but would bet on forward-sloping italics). She is wearing a long string of red beads against a white sweater that is reminiscent of her character Alice’s fashion advice in her 2015 novel, The Past: “you should go for this understated thing, that the French women do”. I feel, from the minute we meet, as if Hadley were a friend unaccountably not seen for years, and, as swiftly, recognise this as an explicable illusion because, like all her admiring readers, I have met her through her beautifully written, quietly bestselling novels, including The Past and Late in the Day (2019) – and now through her bold new book, Free Love. It is not that her writing is autobiographical, more that she has the gift for bringing everything she has, sees and knows to the characters she creates. As soon as she is sitting down, we order a pot of Ceylon tea for two – our excuse, we agree with relief, for shedding our face masks. There is so much to talk about, I say.  Free Love is set in the 60s, and at its centre is Phyllis, an attractive, middle-aged woman who falls in love with Nicky, the grown-up son of a friend of her husband’s – young enough to be her child – and leaves her own children to be with him. The Washington Post has described Hadley as “one of the greatest stylists alive”, and in this novel, as in her others and in her short stories (many of them published in the New Yorker), the beauty of her prose is in its supple, non-attention-seeking articulacy. Free Love is brilliantly plotted and keeps its secret through two-thirds of its length so faithfully, I did not even begin to guess at the hugely satisfying slipknot ahead. But when I put it to Hadley that Free Love is about the cost of love, the price tag attaching to passionate relationships, she just nods in acquiescence, regretfully, as if she could not be expected to be held responsible for this or any other consequence. She is surprised-bordering-on-hurt when I tell her that while she might not condemn Phyllis for abandoning her children, I do. “Do you?” she says wistfully, “My mum does too.” (Her 90-year-old mother, as well as being a critical ally, will turn out be a wonderful presence in our conversation.) Hadley’s surprise at readers not liking some of her female characters is not new (take a look at this London Review bookshop interview), but what fascinates is what this reveals about her creative process. One of her strengths is that she never judges, and this is because she is too closely involved with her characters for the distance that judgment requires: “If I met them I might not like them. But when you’re writing, you’re more interested in getting them, seeing them, just having them there.” By suspending judgment herself, I suggest to her, it is her readers who are left holding the baby of responsibility and likely to become aghast, apprehensive and desperately sorry for Phyllis’s children. Does she feel compassion for her own characters? She wonders if that would come over as “a bit soppy”. And she decides that, anyway, she doesn’t: “It’s a little bit colder than that. When I’m writing Phyllis, I’m being her, which doesn’t involve judging her or feeling compassionate, it’s just inhabiting.” Inhabiting – this is the key; Hadley’s gift is to move in completely. And so to what extent does she see Phyllis’s tumble into love as being about the vain longing to feel young again? “A lot,” she replies, and refers back to the opening chapter, a dinner at Phyllis’s house in which she first sets eyes on Nicky and believes he is recoiling from her physically. “It upends her and destabilises the careless, unexamined assumption she has had that she will go on being herself. She suddenly thinks she is going to be old, and that there is something she has not had. And one has to be reasonably sympathetic to that anguish.” But surely Hadley could not imagine leaving her own children for a man? “I couldn’t – and that has not arisen for me, which is good – but I can imagine the women who have done it and don’t condemn them.” Phyllis’s relationship of loving reciprocity with her nine-year-old son, Hugh, is movingly described. But once Phyllis has deserted, the age of innocence is over. There is an excruciating moment when Hugh receives a birthday card from his mother, while at boarding school, and throws it away. I ask if Hugh is based on any of her sons but this proves too simple a serve and she hits it straight back over the net: “No, that was just made up.” She defends Phyllis by emphasising that she was about to lose her son anyway to boarding school: “It’s a precipitating factor in unloosing her. She has a marvellous, kind, companionable marriage but it’s not passionate on either side. The reward has been her blissful relationship with her son.” Tessa Hadley met her own husband, Eric Hadley, at teacher training college. He was her tutor and she married him at 23, “ridiculously young”, and had her first baby at 24. Elsewhere, she has blamed DH Lawrence for what she describes as “crazy life choices”. She explains now that the craziness was her belief that “a career was not what I wanted”. She was in flight from a “disastrous” year of trying to be a school teacher. She had also flirted with the academic route, getting as far as applying to do a PhD on Jane Austen, but when her husband got a teaching job in Cardiff deciding against that too: “In a Lawrentian spirit I thought there was a falsity and deadness…” she does not finish her sentence. Reading between the lines, it cannot have been an easy time. She admits she kept notebooks about the “tensions of young motherhood and marriage”. As material for a novel? “No, I had nil idea – they were for myself… I loved my sons, and being domesticated gave me alibis for not going out and getting a proper job.” But she veered “backwards and forwards” between feeling she was on the right path (her mother’s) and feeling “desolate I wasn’t in the world”. Hadley has three stepsons and three sons. Her eldest stepson is 55 – 10 years younger than she is. Her youngest son is 30. I am curious – it is something we have in common – to hear about her experience of an all-male household. She had pictured herself having daughters, but “my sons are exactly what I want because they are who they are”. She flags the positives about having boys: “Privacy and a sort of freedom in your head, although anyone who thinks boys don’t suffer from angst – there’s plenty of that. But they are ironists, jokers – you can’t get away with being too solemn. I remember a no-good book I wrote called Crazy Salad, a quotation from Shakespeare. The boys found this on my computer and would weave it into everyday conversation: ‘What’s for supper tonight, Mum? Is it crazy salad?’” They lived in Cardiff in “a house that was a bit of a slum but good for bringing up wild teenagers”. After the boys had grown up, they moved to London for 10 years but are now back in Cardiff “in a very pretty street” so her mother can be with them. “Cardiff is a wonderful city, and it’s great to be in Wales with a Labour government.” But Hadley is, by birth, a Bristolian. She is the daughter of a teacher, Geoff Nichols, who ran a music shop and was a jazz trumpeter with a successful West Country band. He died a couple of years ago (his brother, Tessa’s uncle, was the playwright Peter Nichols). Mary, Hadley’s mother, was a dressmaker and amateur artist, and vivid, positive, glamorous. “She still is. Some people resign themselves early to being elderly, but Mum was furious the other day because she couldn’t hammer in her Christmas decorations.” Over the course of the conversation, we track Hadley’s writing life to its beginnings, starting with the tiny, stitched books she wrote aged 10, illustrated on their backs by her mother: “These were imitation Frances Hodgson Burnett or E Nesbit’s The Wouldbegoods.” She still possesses a little book entitled The Countess which she disparages as “fake” and influenced by Daisy Ashford’s The Young Visiters, but which, she says, has one good line: “Frederick Fillet gazed into the dying coles [an Ashfordesque misspelling] of the fire.” Hadley went to “a horrible girls grammar school” before escaping to join her brother at the local comprehensive. And throughout this time she kept “an utterly humiliating diary”. Her early entries were sweetly uneventful: “Mummy is a pig, she won’t let Kate stay for tea.” But then she sank into the teenage mire: “I don’t think I can live if I don’t see M in the morning.” She laughs. “I don’t even know who M is now!” She was too insecure to write stories: “I’d had the stuffing knocked out of me and was too busy living – or failing to live. Mum was my role model in thinking one had always, first of all, to be loved and make a home.” When she got into Cambridge to read English, she “fell in love with other people’s writing” but still did not dare write herself. Hadley is, and always has been, a bookworm, “a compulsive, obsessive, library-going reader”. A talent for reading is seldom remarked upon but can be the making of a writer. Hadley has been compared to Virginia Woolf, Iris Murdoch and Anne Tyler. But it is the less mainstream novelist, Elizabeth Bowen (1899-1973), who matters to her most: “Bowen’s writing got into my bloodstream. It’s to do with the excitement she has at life. She can make you excited about everything from central heating in a stuffy hallway in a Regent’s Park house, to the sun setting behind hills in Ireland, to a suitcase sliding around on the back seat of a car. The work of getting those things on to the page is so vigorous.” This is Hadley’s work too: “an urge to capture what is actual around me”. And it is work that, at first, led nowhere. Her first novel, Accidents in the Home, was not published until she was 46. For 20 years she weathered rejections (she winces in explanation for her vagueness about the precise number “about 14?”). “I was trying to write and failing catastrophically. It was a compulsion so insane… I did it badly, failed, longed to stop – but couldn’t. Every time I would give up for a bit and then this compulsion returned to write about everything I was seeing, feeling, watching – not just my own thoughts but what was out there. Our moment in Britain…” The born writer in her refused to be still-born, and in her 30s, with scepticism, she says, she enrolled on an MA in creative writing at Bath Spa University, where she would later become, from 1997 onwards, a professor of creative writing herself. She enjoyed the course, but after completing it still did not feel she was where she needed to be as a novelist. She believes “the reason I wrote so badly for so long is that I didn’t have a strongly formed, authoritative self”. She had to learn not to be “in awe of the characters I used to write about in my bad books. I was trying to write as if I were writing books by other novelists I loved – Nadine Gordimer, above all.” But it was doing a PhD on Henry James, whose novels “give you a wonderful permission to make big art out of small things”, that proved to be her turning point. She knew she was a “good critic”, and she was able to harness that authority and apply it to her fiction. But it is plot, she says, that remains the “hardest thing to get right. Finding the story is the secret. I spend a lot of time with horrible brain ache… I used to say to my students (I am no longer teaching): work at the story but don’t work too hard. Just dream it… such a contradiction.” I tell her that, aside from her mastery of plot, what I love most is her ability to understand that minds are rogue and can host contradictory feelings (like Christine in Late in the Day who, devastated by her husband’s desertion, simultaneously and fleetingly exults at having their flat to herself). Hadley cannot account for this imaginative leaping, except by describing herself as having a “weird absorbency”. Before we part, I briefly refer back to Phyllis and her fear of ageing. How much does Hadley mind getting older herself? “It was anguishing in my late 40s and early 50s – that was the transition, when it felt there were things that hadn’t happened. I don’t feel like that now. But it would be stupid for there not to be a sadness in being older as well as repose and a kind of calm.” And she describes the “joy” of writing a novel and the slog, the “two to three years of haulage”, and the knowing, as she gets older, that she will not be able to produce novels for ever. But she emphasises that she feels lucky to have succeeded, and describes being published as “lovely”. Yet there remains a trace of anxiety. “I sometimes look at my marvellous daughter-in-law who is a civil servant in housing and think, ‘Good God, I’m only making things up’, and I feel a twinge of shame.” Her self-doubt must be a burden. What is it she feels she has not done? She leans forward, says she does not know, wonders: “Maybe it is to be Phyllis and have rashly run off?” She then quickly takes that back. And it’s at this point that the thought – it could hardly be clearer – arises in us simultaneously: it is through her novels that she pursues the paths not taken and leads the lives unled.

1/9/2022,"On 24 December, the movie Don’t Look Up began streaming on Netflix following a limited release in cinemas. It’s a satirical story, directed by Adam McKay, about what happens when a lowly PhD student (played by Jennifer Lawrence) and her supervisor (Leonardo DiCaprio) discover that an Everest-size asteroid is heading for Earth. What happens is that they try to warn their fellow Earthlings about this existential threat only to find that their intended audience isn’t interested in hearing such bad news. The movie has been widely watched but has had a pasting from critics. It was, said the Observer’s Simran Hans, a “shrill, desperately unfunny climate-change satire”. The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw found it a “laboured, self-conscious and unrelaxed satire… like a 145-minute Saturday Night Live sketch with neither the brilliant comedy of Succession… nor the seriousness that the subject might otherwise require”.  Those complaints about crudity and OTT-ness rang a bell. It just so happens that a distinctly over-the-top satire published in 1729 attracted comparable reactions. Its author, Jonathan Swift, was an Anglo-Irish clergyman who was dean of St Patrick’s Cathedral in Dublin. Swift’s title – A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People from Being a Burthen to Their Parents or Country and for Making Them Beneficial to the Publick – gives only a hint of the savagery of the satire within. For the nub of the proposal was that that the impoverished Irish might ease their economic troubles by selling their children as food to rich gentlemen and ladies. “A young healthy child well nursed,” it reads, “is, at a year old, a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricassee, or a ragout.” You get the drift. Swift’s target was the Anglo-Irish aristocracy, often absentee landlords living on the rents of their desperately poor Irish tenantry while poncing about in Mayfair. McKay’s targets are more diffuse. He aims less at a specific class than an entire way of life – at people too stupefied by consumerism, short-termism and social media, too hypnotised by the interests of big tech corporations, to worry about the future of humankind. Which brings us, oddly enough, to a contemporary obsession – the frenzy now surrounding non-fungible tokens or NFTs. For those who have not yet noticed this obsession, an NFT is basically a traceable code that is indelibly attached to a digital object such as an image or recording. Once someone has bought that object it becomes irrevocably registered to their ID and so they can be said to be owners of the code. If it sounds abstruse, then that’s because it is. And yet, over the last 18 months or so, NFTs have become a sensation in the art world or, at any rate, in the part of it controlled by the big auction houses. Last June, Sotheby’s ran an auction of NFTs with prices ranging between $9,000 and $11m. In an earlier auction by Christie’s, a digital artwork by Mike Winkelmann, who calls himself Beeple, sold for $69m. Up to that point, Mr Winkelmann had never sold a print for more than a hundred bucks. You can guess what this has triggered: an avalanche of wannabe Beeples, plus a lot of speculative hustlers who see a possibility of more modest jackpots for relatively little work (say a recording of your charming cat’s purr). Anyone can play at the game and there are useful DIY guides on the web for those interested in having a go. So what’s not to like? Surely it’s a good thing that artists who have had a hard time earning a crust in the pandemic can get paid? It is. But there is one small snag: the technology that ensures that the NFT you’ve bought is a blockchain similar to the ones that power cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin or Ethereum. And the computation needed to provide the certification that is the USP of blockchains requires massive amounts of electricity, which comes with a correspondingly heavy carbon footprint. A single transaction on the Ethereum blockchain, for example, currently requires 232.51 kWh, which is equivalent to the power consumption of an average US household over 7.86 days. If McKay decides that he’d like to have another go at Swiftian satire, there’s an opening for him here. Nero merely fiddled while Rome burned: we’re enthusiastically bidding for NFTs while heating up the planet.

1/9/2022,"Jack Saunders might possess a PhD and have lectured undergraduates for 10 years, most recently at University College London, yet in all that time job security and an above-inflation pay rise have eluded him. “I have been on a fixed-term contract since I started in 2011,” he said. “And there hasn’t been a pay award above inflation since Gordon Brown was prime minister. It means you are always searching the job market and each job is a stopgap.”  Saunders, a rep for the University and College Union, a trade union representing academics, went on strike along with staff from 57 other institutions for three days last month. He is expecting to support further strikes in a war of attrition with university employers over three issues – low pay, cuts to the academic staff pension scheme and the “casualisation” of the workforce, where fewer staff are on permanent contracts. “Higher education employers have adopted a form of macho management that just makes things worse for staff every year that it goes on,” he added. The Universities and Colleges Employers Association has offered a 1.5% rise dated back to April, arguing that in the midst of a pandemic, and when it is putting increased sums into academics’ final salary pension schemes, it cannot afford any more. At the B&Q warehouse and distribution centre in Worksop, and at workplaces across the country, the story is much the same. Faced with the huge squeeze on living costs, as inflation erodes wages and household bills soar, workers are demanding pay rises to keep up. About 450 staff who work for the logistics firm Wincanton and operate the B&Q site in Nottinghamshire have downed tools to protest at a 2% pay offer, subsequently increased, without resolving the dispute, to 4%. One worker at the site said it was clear staff were angry about more than the steeply rising cost of living after a 96% vote in favour of strike action. “The site has been in operation for 16 years and this is the first dispute. But the employer doesn’t recognise that people are working in a harsh environment for 40 hours a week, being monitored all the time, and, on top of that, can’t make ends meet when many are paid less than £10 an hour,” they said. The Unite union is supporting workers with strike pay, though many were already using a hardship fund and regularly visiting food banks. Wincanton said: “We value the vital work our colleagues carry out every day and the offer we have put forward is fair and competitive. We remain committed to finding a resolution that satisfies all parties.” Mike Clancy, the general secretary of the Prospect union, said the rising cost of living was throwing fuel on a tinder box of grievances built up before and during the pandemic. “Pay disputes are usually the result of a deeper malaise inside the organisation,” he said. Prospect has grown to represent 150,000 members over a wide range of industries, mostly in higher, professional grades. While it has a fraction of Unite’s 1 million-plus membership, it too is involved in several pay disputes, most recently at the government agency Natural England. Staff went on a work-to-rule last week after a succession of wage freezes and low pay awards the union says go back more than a decade. Union negotiator Jane Lancastle said the agency’s management were exploiting staff who joined on starting salaries of £22,168. “The starting salary at the Environment Agency is £24,213 and £27,235 at the Forestry Commission. When more than half the staff say in the employer’s own survey their job has made them ill in the last year, it is not surprising the want to take action,” she said. A 76% vote in favour of a strike has been put on the back burner while talks with the management continue. Until a few weeks ago, the incomes expert Ken Mulkearn was convinced a spike in inflation would pass without much reaction from Britain’s 32 million-strong workforce; a decade of low average pay following the 2008 financial crash seemed to suggest that workers, fearful of an increasingly insecure jobs market, had little appetite for confrontation. “Now I’m not so sure. There are signs rising prices are having an impact,” he said. Behind the Bank of England’s interest rate rise last month was a fear that runaway prices could spark a succession of sky-high wage demands. Over the next couple of months thousands of companies will consider how much to pay staff from April and whether that means an inflation-busting, real-terms rise heading towards double figures. With the main measure of inflation, the consumer prices index (CPI) at 5.1% and heading towards 6%, officials at the Bank have scoured private sector pay-settlement data to detect whether a wage/price spiral – one that entrenches rocketing levels of inflation for years to come – has gained momentum and if they need to impose further rate rises in 2022 to calm the situation down. Mulkearn, the director of Incomes Data Research, of is one of the experts consulted by the Bank. His firm found the median pay award across the economy was 2.3% in the three months to November – with little sign of a wage spiral. Rival consultancy XpertHR says much the same. Its median basic pay monitor found increases averaged 2.2% in the same period, up from 2% in October, based on the outcome of 42 pay settlements that took effect between 1 September and 30 November, covering more than 650,000 employees. It said the rise for public sector workers was just 1.4%, down from 2.5% a year earlier. The official data, which also takes into account increases in pay when staff are promoted or change jobs, jumped in the first months of the pandemic, mostly in response to large job losses among lower-paid workers that artificially raised the average. A spike above 8% began to fade in the summer. In the latest figures, for October, the average increase in pay had tumbled below 4% and looked to be falling further in November. Mulkearn believes a wave of disputes and strike ballots mean isolated settlements above the rate of inflation could become more common. Not that there is the prospect of a general strike or even the kind of mass industrial strife that characterised the 1970s, when union membership peaked at 12 million. Stephen Bevan, head of research at the Institute for Employment Studies, said there was little evidence so far that either the 6.7 million unionised workers (4 million of them in the public sector), or the 76.3% who are not members, were buckling up for a fight over pay, other than at the margins. Union membership among private sector companies stands at one of the lowest levels on record, at 2.56 million in 2020. Bevan said that while firms like Amazon and Starbucks had gained publicity in the UK for pushing salaries above the legal minimums, they were unlikely to permit year-on-year real-terms increases. “The reality is that these are US companies and when you look at how they operate, in the US they are paying consultancies to make sure unions cannot even gain a foothold.” Most workers remained in a weak position after the shift to “individualised performance pay”, he said, which forced them to fight on their own, face-to-face with their manager. “Individual pay faded, but working from home is bringing it back.” Nevertheless, a skills shortage, especially in manufacturing after an exodus of older skilled workers, but also in professional sectors such as law, accountancy and computer services, is working in favour of staff. About 1,200 Tesco warehouse staff and HGV drivers recently rejected a 4% pay offer, threatening Christmas deliveries, before settling on 5.5%, backdated to July, plus a further 0.5% in February. The Usdaw union settled with Tesco for what is thought to be a similar amount, on behalf of 5,000 members. In November, Ford agreed a two-year deal that kicks off with a 5.1% rise before pegging pay to the retail prices index (RPI) in the second year. RPI is currently standing at 7.1%. Sharon Graham, the new leader of Unite, is credited with orchestrating a more focused campaign by the union to match pay to inflation, and exert pressure resulting from high levels of vacancies and changing work patterns to redress a decade of low pay. Mulkearn says Unite has “moved to a different footing” since the departure of Len McCluskey, who was renowned for political grandstanding; it now focuses more on nitty-gritty issues such as pay. The University and College Union says successful strike ballots at 58 universities could be joined by another 42 universities that failed last year to reach the 50% participation threshold. They are being re-ballotted, making it possible that 100 will be involved in strikes when the outcome is known on 14 January. Nurses have rejected a 3% pay offer and in a consultative ballot in December found more than half in favour of strike action. The civil service union PCS is holding similar consultation that general secretary Mark Serwotka says will gauge whether members are prepared to take strike action over pay, pensions and living standards. Kate Bell, head of rights at the TUC, said there was anecdotal evidence workers were flexing their muscles after pushing average wage rises to around 4% pre-Covid. “Lots of people have been working hard through the pandemic and understandably want to get back to pay rises at that level,” she said. “There is a broader sense that people who have battled through the pandemic want and need a real-terms pay rise.” So far, only the RMT union, which represents rail workers, looks like securing an above-inflation rise if RPI is used as the benchmark for deals. It already has a commitment that Transport for London will increase tube drivers’ salaries by RPI plus 0.1% from April. Agreed as part of a three-year deal, it looks prescient now. As a negotiator, the RMT stands out. No other can match its resolve – or its ability to bring the railways to a halt. That may mean the Bank of England is worrying unnecessarily about wages taking off – at least not with the ferocity seen in the 1970s, when union membership was strong and wage bargaining to beat inflation was the norm.",News/Business,Cost of living crisis raises fears of a new era of industrial strife,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/08/cost-of-living-crisis-raises-fears-of-a-new-era-of-industrial-strife
1/9/2022,"This time last year my partner John and I celebrated purchasing an electric car by driving through London to see the Christmas lights without having to pay congestion or Ulez – ultra-low emission zone – charges. I gleefully tweeted that Regent Street, deserted in lockdown, seemed a London from a different era: empty roads and glittering shop windows. This was my first moment of enjoyment of the electric vehicle (EV), whose purchase had been the source of considerable domestic tension. An eternal optimist, John was convinced we should dispense with a diesel car. The arrival of a grandchild, living at the opposite diagonal corner of London, tipped the balance. It would cut 30 minutes off a hellish journey.  I mainly saw negatives. I liked my nippy BMW and had range anxiety. How far could we go before the battery failed? Would we be able to do long drives? Were our meandering journeys through France finished for good? “Of course we’ll go,” John said. ‘The French are way ahead of us when it comes to electric.” Not in the Tesla price bracket, we settled on a Renault Zoe. Of the cheaper cars, it had the longest range: about 240 miles on a full charge, weather and driving conditions dependent. But all EVs are expensive – £31,000 for this small and far-from-luxury car. We opted to lease, paying a small amount of cash and then monthly payments. From the outset the whole experience was distinctly lacking in frills; a couple of young petrolheads waved us goodbye with minimal induction to the car and no information about the charging infrastructure, except to “use the Zap[-Map] app to find a charge point”. One piece of info that would have been handy for our survival was that EVs have incredible acceleration. We had been in eco-mode since purchasing the car, when, on the first trip outside London, we found ourselves labouring up a hill, accelerator flat to the floor and still only hitting 55mph. John reached over and switched off eco-mode “to see what happens”. Pinned against the seats by the sheer force, we took off like a rocket. We were on our own trying to figure out the mysteries of the country’s charging network. BP rang, offering us a charging point outside our house. This domestic charging is cheapest but, living in a London terrace, we were ineligible. Instead we became aficionados of charging lamp-posts, relatively common in our area. But, as often with EVs, there is a catch. Wandsworth borough council does not reserve the parking spaces for EVs, so “ordinary” cars park there, displacing EVs, which are forced to hunt around for one of the faster, more expensive chargers. There are numerous providers and not very numerous chargers. Each provider requires you to download its app and subscribe. They all work differently and prices vary. Many chargers are out of order. Problems are most visible on longer journeys. When lockdown was relaxed in May we booked to stay at Derek Gow’s rewilding project in Devon. We planned to stop where there were “clusters” of chargers but still got caught out, idling away an hour in a glum corner of Amesbury in Wiltshire, only to discover the charger had stopped working after 10 minutes. After that, it was a hunt for other chargers in obscure garden centres, supermarkets and garages. Some worked, some did not, but we began to meet the community of electric adventurers, passing time waiting for chargers by comparing apps, prices and “worst EV journeys”. Most places are willing to help out with charging. They were happy to sling a wire at Gow’s and on the way back, the Bull hotel in Bridport, Dorset – booked last minute – didn’t turn a hair, reserving us a place by an external charging point. “We’d better get used to this,” they said. But plugging into unprepared domestic supplies is not always successful. In June we managed to blow the electrics of our friends’ home in Kent. By July I noticed my range anxiety was fading. I didn’t think twice about a trip to North Yorkshire. I no longer watched the battery gauge. If the car said it would do another 106 miles, it meant it. Stops could be planned confidently. A new mentality was creeping in: “get as far as you can” was replaced by scheduling in longer stops and delays. But “laid-back” only works up to a point. There were still anxious moments – chargers not working, less-than-helpful helplines and ever more provider registrations. The new anxiety was charge anxiety – not that the car cannot do it, but that chargers will not be available. By August it was decision time for France. John was still pushing for the 700-mile journey in this car. I was just as set against it: I could not recall seeing chargers around and my French source said our destination village had a charger that was invariably hors service. I got my way and was also proved right. Once there and able to look around, it was clear France was not electric car nirvana after all. So the French EV adventure still awaits. By autumn the car was a useful, boring thing rather than a source of anxiety. We could drive to and fro to Kent on one charge, smugly travel across central London, laugh at the fuel shortages and reduce charge anxiety by sticking to reliable chargers. But I noticed gender division was setting in. John had most of the apps on his phone and did more of the technical side, especially midnight trips to find a lamp-post. This is typical, judging from encounters with the informal club of early adopters, mainly male, around the charging points. So, I no longer have diesel particles on my conscience and changes in driving habits augur well for the environment. Conscious of conserving energy, you drive at lower speeds, while travel by train for longer journeys becomes more appealing. But the unnecessarily complicated charger network leaves everything to be desired. There is no universal charge card for all suppliers and far too few chargers overall. This will be a huge problem when EV numbers increase. Lack of government regulation is also ridiculous: as things stand, multiple suppliers face no comeback if they fail to keep chargers working. I cannot say the electric car has widened my horizons, but it has made me plan more carefully for reaching them.",News/Environment,Streets ahead?

1/9/2022,"At what point in the ledger of brutal, sapping days, of boundary-fumbling jeers and spiralling numbers, does a tour from hell tick over into something more human and manageable: a tour from limbo or purgatory, from the uneasy netherworld of the merely very bad? English spinners have tended to die the most public of sporting deaths in Australia. Take the long view and the realistic goal for these brave, lost boys, these gadabouts in Napoleonic uniforms marching in single file across the flatlands, is to avoid being the worst guy, the one with the quiz question numbers, the English spin bowler who gets to define this four-yearly horror.  On day four of the Sydney Test, as England resisted – gassed and wobbling, but hanging on all the same – Jack Leach finally caught a break. And Leach has probably found that moment of grace now, or just enough to have something of his own alongside the bruises and buffetings. In Sydney Leach took four for 84 in Australia’s second innings, despite never really offering any sense of control. In his first spell he had Australia’s batsmen in two minds, unsure whether to cut him or drive him as he bowled too short or too full. But he did also have one wonderful moment, the kind of moment he will treasure and tend to, and place in a jar over the mantelpiece. Coming back just after lunch, with Australia on 83 for three, Leach had figures of 6-0-28-1. A little earlier, after Leach had lured Marcus Harris into a loose drive, Steve Smith had come dandying out of his crease and launched Leach in a wonderful cinematic arc over mid-off, the brand of shot that reminds us what a wonderful mover, athlete and basic cricketing specimen Smith is, besides the numbers and the twitches and the chirrups. Smith was on 22 off 26 by now and cruising. There was a brief delay as Haseeb Hameed, who always seems to be tumbling out of the door with his school tie askew clutching a piece of toast, fiddled his way into a pair of shin-pads. Leach’s fifth ball was a skiddy arm ball. Smith played that weird lean-back push, the shot of a man resplendent at the prow of his yacht, missed the ball and saw it splay his stumps. For Leach, face a little puce, there was was an edge of bottled rage in the celebrations. Understandably so. How long have you got? The ballad of Jack Leach is a fascinating tale. He isn’t exactly a victim – Leach has his first central contract now of an up-and-down career – more a leaf blown along the road, tossed in the to-and-fro conflicting winds, manfully clinging to his path. He took 28 wickets in six Tests in Galle, Ahmedabad and Chennai in spring and was then dropped for the entire summer. This is the level of deep thought in England’s brains trust. We’re going to play this bloke in the Ashes. Let’s leave him out for nine months. Instead Leach bowled 29 championship overs between the 25 April and 11 July, then didn’t bowl again until the end of August, then didn’t bowl between 22 September and just before lunch at the Gabba, when his captain decided this was the ideal moment to shove him down the mountain and see if he was ready for the black run. He hasn’t bowled well in Australia. There will be criticism of the defensive fields at the SCG, but the fact is Leach kept pitching short and the ball kept being pounded out to the man on the fence. In three Tests he has six wickets at 53.5 and has gone at 4.3 runs an over. How bad is this? Well, here’s the thing: it’s pretty standard. Four years ago Moeen Ali and Mason Crane took six wickets at 128 between them. Four years before that Graeme Swann and Monty Panesar took 10 at 81.7. Four years before that Panesar and Ashley Giles took 13 at 49. All bled runs. Even in the great outlier, 2010-11, Swann’s 15 wickets came at 39.8. What he did so well was offer control, going at 2.72 runs an over and playing a key role in the win at Adelaide. So what, really, did we expect now? The real story of Leach’s tour has been the same as everyone else’s. He needs runs, pressure leverage, games that go into the last two days. A spin bowler with no backup, no platform is basically someone bowling slowly and hoping for the best. There were some other good things on the fourth day for England. Ollie Pope’s wicketkeeping was lithe and limber. There was even something refreshing in the sound of his eager, piping chat, a pleasant change from the silent sadness of Jos Buttler, who crouches for every ball with the look of a laudanum-addled poet splayed in his garret composing his latest ode to death. And there was Leach’s final hurrah, two wickets in the slog that leave him on a hat-trick the next time he plays. When will that be? Dom Bess will perhaps get a game in Hobart. And there would be something very Jack, very much the leaf tumbling down that windswept path, were Leach never to play again, but end his career suspended on a hat-trick. More likely that moment might have to wait until the English summer, when the home crowd can gild it with some well-deserved underdog affection.",Sport/Sport,The ballad of Jack Leach: a leaf blown along the road and into the Ashes | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/08/the-ballad-of-jack-leach-a-leaf-blown-along-the-road-and-into-the-ashes
1/9/2022,"Matty Pearson was Burnley’s nemesis once again as his late header saw Huddersfield come from behind to dump the Premier League side out of the FA Cup with a 2-1 win at Turf Moor. Pearson, whose extra-time goal gave Accrington Stanley a League Cup win over Burnley in 2016, headed in for the Championship club four minutes from time after Josh Koroma had cancelled out Jay Rodriguez’s first-half goal.  It means the Terriers are into the fourth round for the first time since 2018, while relegation-threatened Burnley are left to wonder if this will again be a league fixture next season.The Clarets were without manager Sean Dyche - absent with Covid-19 - and without a spark against the Terriers, who made seven changes to the side that drew 0-0 with Blackburn last weekend but who were able to boss the second half. This is the 100th anniversary of Huddersfield’s only FA Cup success - a run which began with a 2-2 draw at Turf Moor - and though a repeat would be beyond a fairy-tale, this was a fine start. League Two Hartlepool United also provided an early shock on third-round Saturday with a 2-1 win over Championship Blackpool. Keshi Anderson gave Blackpool an eighth-minute lead but David Ferguson equalised just after half-time and on the hour mark teenager Joe Grey scored the winner. League Two Mansfield Town were pipped at the death after a brave fightback in a 3-2 home defeat by Middlesbrough. The visitors were in command with two goals in the first 14 minutes. But Stags dominated the second half and thought they had forced extra time when Rhys Oates levelled after 85 minutes only to be undone by a John-Joe O’Toole own goal in stoppage time. And in a pair of all-Championship ties, Coventry were 1-0 winners over Derby, while Fulham needed extra time for victory by the same scoreline over Bristol City.",Sport/Football,FA Cup third-round roundup: Burnley shocked by Championship Huddersfield,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/08/fa-cup-third-round-roundup
