3/17/2022,"Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg acknowledges already fragile global supply chains have been dealt a twin blow from Western sanctions on Russia for its war on Ukraine and fresh lockdowns in China due to renewed COVID-19 outbreaks. ""Well, they are major curveballs for the economy and for the supply chain,"" Buttigieg told Yahoo Finance. ""And this is exactly why we've been so focused on making our supply chains more resilient. We don't know what the next shot is going to be — a pandemic, a war, a climate-related extreme weather event, which is happening more and more frequently every passing year. But we shouldn't have to know what the threat is going to be to know that we've got to have more nimble supply chains to deal with any threat, to deal with any uncertainty."" On that score, the Biden administration revealed a new program on Tuesday designed to improve battered supply chains by bolstering data visibility among companies. The initiative — led by Buttigieg and National Economic Council director Brian Deese — is formally called ""Freight Logistics Optimization Works,"" or FLOW. The data-sharing initiative focuses on ensuring companies have insight into what and how cargo is being moved around the supply chain. Some of the key private companies that have signed on early are Target, UPS and FedEx. Despite the new initiative, it's unclear how supply chains will react in the coming days and weeks to fresh external pressures. One of Apple's largest suppliers Foxconn has temporarily halted operations as the Chinese government looks to contain a new COVID-19 outbreak. It's unclear when operations will restart. If the shutdown persists, analysts warn, it could hurt the bottom line of Apple and others in the tech supply chain. Meanwhile, corporate America has joined in protest of Moscow’s military attack on Ukraine, moving to sever business dealings with Russia or take a stand in support for Ukrainian refugees. Companies halting operations in Russia range from jeans maker Levi's to computer giant HP. Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

3/17/2022,"(Reuters) -Russia said on Wednesday that some parts of a possible peace deal with Ukraine were close to being agreed after Kyiv agreed to discuss neutrality, raising hopes of an end to the biggest war in Europe since World War Two. ""Neutral status is now being seriously discussed along, of course, with security guarantees,"" Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said told RBC news. ""Now this very thing is being discussed in negotiations - there are absolutely specific formulations which in my view are close to agreement,"" Lavrov said. He said that President Vladimir Putin had spoken about neutrality, along with security guarantees for Ukraine without NATO enlargement, as one possible variant in February. The euro extended gains after Lavrov's comments and was up 0.4% to $ 1.1005. Lavrov cautioned that the negotiations were not easy but that there was ""some hope of reaching a compromise"". Ukraine has also made cautious positive statements on peace talks. It says it is willing to negotiate to the end the war, but will not surrender or accept Russian ultimatums. Lavrov said key issues included the security of people in eastern Ukraine, the demilitarisation of Ukraine and the rights of Russian-speaking people in Ukraine. Announcing the invasion on Feb. 24, Putin blamed the United States for threatening Russia by enlarging the NATO military alliance eastwards into Russia's backyard. Putin said there was no option but to launch the military operation because Russian-speaking people in Ukraine had been subjected to genocide by ""nationalists and neo-Nazis"" since Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea. Ukraine and the West says claims of genocide are baseless.

 A pundit is facing fierce backlash for knocking Volodymyr Zelensky's casual look during the Ukrainian president's wartime address to Congress. Peter Schiff, a former GOP Senate candidate in Connecticut and chief economist at Euro Pacific Capital, wrote Wednesday following Zelensky's impassioned plea to lawmakers that he understood ""times are hard"" but questioned the Ukraine leader's choice of appearing in an army-green T-shirt. Zelensky was speaking from Kyiv, which is under bombardment by the Russian military. He has frequently worn the army-green shirt in a series of appearances, including while speaking to other foreign governments. Schiff faced intense blowback for the remark, with critics dubbing it one of his ""worst all time takes."" ""The guy is in the middle of a war zone ducking mortars, Peter, he's not going to be rolling around his garment rack with him,"" one Twitter user wrote. Another user responded, ""Unfortunately the Kyiv Men's Warehouse was closed for bombing repairs."" Schiff appeared to double down on his remarks following the criticism, suggesting Zelensky could have opted for a collared shirt.

3/17/2022,"A white North Carolina woman is the subject of a criminal investigation after stealing a “Black Lives Matter” sign out of another person’s front yard. The theft was caught on the victim’s Ring camera located near the property’s front door. According to WSOC-TV, an unidentified woman trespassed on Melanie Larkey’s property with the sole aim of removing the sign from her yard on Friday, March 11, around 1:30 pm. The ginger-haired woman got out of a black sedan and marched up the grass to the sign. Before pulling up the sign, she waved at the camera. Then she retreated back to the car. The homeowner was in her house during the crime but did not know anything was happening at the time. It was not until she reviewed her camera’s footage that she became aware of the violation. “Surprised and unsettled are going to be the two words I’m going to use,” Larkey said when asked to describe how she felt. She continued, “It was really unnerving. Her abrasiveness and walking into my yard and stealing something that didn’t belong to her.” “Then she even waved at the camera,” Larkey recalled. “And then made some distasteful remarks when she got back to the car she was in.” The community of Starmount in south Charlotte, North Carolina, boasts approximately 2,800 people throughout its two ZIP codes (28210 and 28217). A predominately Hispanic and white neighborhood, less than 7 percent of the people that live in the area identify as African American, City-Data.com reports. Larkey believes the sign and conversations about race should not seem provocative. In fact, because of the lack of diversity within the area, it could serve as an educational tool. “I can’t figure out what it is about my sign that says, ‘Black Lives Matter’ is so upsetting to other people,” she remarked. “It has shown me, and a lot of the neighbors have mentioned it too, that we need a discussion about race.” “Race and racial discussions in this country shouldn’t be provocative. They should be out in the open. People should be able to have a discussion about it,” Larkey concluded. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg police said they are still investigating the case. However, over the last two years, activists, supporters, and allies with BLM signs outside of their homes have increasingly been the targets of harassment, intimidation, or hate crimes. In July 2021, a 32-year-old white Minnesota man harassed a Black family because he was allegedly upset they put a sign in their yard and spoke out against racism in their children’s school. The family reported the man’s harassment to authorities and received a restraining order, after suspecting he might harm them. That did not stop him from stealing his roommate’s SUV and ramming it into a Black family’s home. Inside the truck, the man left a teddy bear hanging with a noose around his neck. For this, he was charged with 11 criminal counts including two counts of second-degree assault, two counts of stalking, and one count of first-degree property damage. A month later, a man thought to be a Chicago city worker yanked and turned over a Black Lives Matter sign a Black family placed in their yard. Like both of the aforementioned incidents, the homeowner also saw the assailant strike while reviewing his home’s security footage. Dimitri Hepburn, the owner of the property where the sign was, called the man’s actions “shocking.” “He took the time to turn it over so that it was face down,” Hepburn said. “It was … I don’t wanna say unbelievable, but shocking.” He continued, “It was a violation of my First Amendment rights. You have signs up in my own yard. It was a violation of our safety and privacy, I felt.” Candace Nadeen Breen, a Black resident of Rhode Island, also believes these “microaggressions” are used to intimidate and violate people’s sense of safety and privacy. She said she received a letter on Jan. 16, 2021, that read in part, “Please remove your black lives matter Marxist anti-American paraphernalia as well as well. The angry Black Lives Matter has taken in billions and billions of dollars and never helped one black person and yet you bow down to this group. This is an embarrassment to this country.” She was able to trace it back to a white woman, who happened to be her neighbor, named Laura Larrivee. Larrivee is an outspoken supporter of former President Donald Trump, who herself has signs planted in her yard celebrating Donald Trump and has decorated her yard with tombstones for former NFL player and activist Colin Kaepernick and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. “This was a crime. It was an invasion of our space, it came into our house, and it’s wrong,” Breen told Atlanta Black Star. “The letter was so unhinged. It was a rant that really made no sense. None whatsoever. And those kinds of people can get violent.” Like others who have had their homes targeted because they choose to place Black Lives Matter signs in their year, Breen said she feels “unsafe.” “I felt very, very unsafe. This was hate,” she said. “I didn’t ask for this. I never, ever, ever bothered that person. Never sent them an email, never talked about them on social media. We aren’t like that, we don’t do that, which is why it’s very surprising that they came my way with that nonsense.” Stealing a sign outside of someone’s home, whether it has a socio-political statement or campaigning for a specific politician, is considered a Class C misdemeanor in most states. In Connecticut, it is classified as “6th-degree larceny, which is defined as larceny where the value of the stolen property or services is $250 or less.”",U.S./Atlanta Black Star,"White Woman Caught Stealing BLM Yard Sign In North Carolina, Then Waves to Camera: ‘It Was Really Unnerving’:",https://news.yahoo.com/white-woman-caught-stealing-blm-150000145.html
3/17/2022,"Trump put out a statement repeating his false claims about NATO on Wednesday. He released the statement as Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy was wrapping an emotional address to Congress. Trump has repeatedly and wrongly claimed that NATO is ""delinquent"" and member countries need to ""pay up."" Former President Donald Trump released a lengthy statement full of false claims about NATO while praising himself for bolstering the alliance. The statement came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was wrapping up an emotional address to Congress in which he called on the US government to take stronger action to counter Russia's devastating war in Ukraine. Trump has repeatedly gotten basic facts of NATO wrong or been willfully lying about the alliance he's said was ""obsolete"" only to later correct himself because he did not know ""much about NATO."" Most of Trump's new statement repeated previous false claims he's made about the NATO alliance, including that several member countries were ""delinquent"" and that he was the one who got them to ""pay up"" in exchange for the US's protection. ""Nobody knew things would happen so rapidly, but NATO was poor and now it is rich, and all of the Fake News commentators that said Trump was tearing down NATO should be ashamed of themselves for telling lies,"" Trump's statement said. He went on to say that unlike previous US presidents, ""I acted, and acted strongly. I said to them, 'if you don't pay up, no protection.' They all paid up, and paid up quickly."" Contrary to Trump's claims, European members of NATO and Canada had increased their defense spending in 2015 and 2016, before Trump took office. Also, NATO countries don't pay up. They have pledged to spend a certain amount of their gross domestic product on their own militaries, and pay a small stipend to fund NATO headquarters. And in 2014, two years before Trump came into office, all NATO members reached an agreement to spend at least two percent of their annual GDP on their own defense by 2024. Trump's assertion that members of the alliance were ""delinquent"" in their contributions also doesn't add up, because countries decided on their own how much of their GDP to spend on their own defense. In other words, as fact checkers have pointed out, they don't ""owe"" NATO or the US money. ""There is no ledger that maintains accounts of what countries pay and owe,"" former Obama administration National Security Council staffer Aaron O'Connell told NPR. ""NATO is not like a club with annual membership fees."" That said, NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg did give Trump credit for pushing NATO countries to spend more, noting that Canada and European allies added $130 billion to their defense budgets for a total goal of $400 billion by 2024. Trump ""is committed to NATO,"" Stoltenberg told Fox News at the time. He added: ""But at the same time, he has clearly stated that NATO allies need to invest more. And therefore at the summit in July last year, we agreed to do more to step up, and now we see the results.""

3/17/2022,"SURFSIDE, Fla. (AP) — The mayor of the South Florida town where 98 people died in a beachfront condominium collapse last summer has been voted out of office. Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett came in third in Tuesday's election, according to uncertified results from the Miami-Dade County Elections Department. Business owner Shlomo Danzinger won the race with 499 votes, followed by Vice Mayor Tina Paul with 476 votes and Burkett with 466. “The voters have their own ideas and I’m happy with the determination of the voters,” Burkett told the Miami Herald. “That works for me just fine.” The newly elected mayor and commission will be sworn in Wednesday. Danzinger, 42, said residents were tired of the constant bickering, mostly between Burkett and Commissioner Eliana Salzhauer. Salzhauer, who also lost her seat, flipped her middle fingers at the mayor twice, drawing wide media attention. “If we don’t end up in the newspapers in the next two years, that’ll be an accomplishment,” Danzinger told the Herald. Nearly 6,000 people live in Surfside, just north of Miami Beach, where luxury condominium high-rises lining the oceanfront draw an outsized number of people who can't vote. Residents include Latin Americans, Canadian snowbirds and Russian immigrants along with Orthodox Jewish families. The 40-year-old Champlain Towers complex began collapsing with virtually no warning in the early morning hours of June 24. The disaster exposed delays in repairs that were needed to comply with Miami-Dade County's 40-year-recertification process. Emergency workers spent weeks searching for survivors and then human remains in the wreckage of the 12-story building. A lawsuit continues as parties work to reach a settlement. The site where the towers once stood will be put up for auction at the end of April, attorneys said. One offer for about $120 million has been on the table for months, but there may be others as the auction approaches.",U.S./Associated Press,"Surfside, Florida votes out the mayor after condo collapse",https://news.yahoo.com/surfside-florida-votes-mayor-condo-133549312.html
3/17/2022,"The president of Finland has spoken of his concern that Vladimir Putin could launch a ‘hybrid war’ on the country if it joins Nato. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Finnish prime minister Sanna Marin acknowledged the debate surrounding its membership of Nato ""will change”, having previously stated it is ""very unlikely"" Finland – which borders Russia – would apply for a Nato membership during her current term of office. Polling earlier this month showed around 62% of Finns now back such a move, the first time a majority of the population has done so and up from around 28% in February. But speaking on BBC’s Newsnight on Tuesday, Finnish president Sauli Niinisto warned Putin could unleash a hybrid war – a mixture of conventional warfare and other methods - if Finland were to press ahead with membership. Last month, Russia threatened ""serious military and political repercussions"" if the Nordic country were to join the Atlantic alliance. Niinisto said that while Finland is a “military non-alliance”, it is not neutral due to its “deep enhanced partnership with Nato”. Watch: Boris Johnson hosts Finnish President for talks at No. 10 He warned: “I don't believe Russia will come with tanks. “I don't believe there will be a war but I believe there would be a hybrid war… there would be more tension going on.” Elina Valtonen, an MP for Finland’s National Coalition Party, said that a hybrid war on Finland would mean “other means of interfering with our sovereignty or security”. Watch: Nato - the western alliance that protects the security of Europe The Russian missile strike on a Ukrainian military base close to the border with Poland has raised new fears that Nato could be drawn into the conflict. 

Here we look at why Nato was formed, its purpose and its significance in the war between Russia and Ukraine. She explained: “For instance, sending a number refugees across our border, which has been tried by Putin a number of years ago in northern Finland… “It can be anything else – for instance interfering with electricity systems or cyber warfare.” Last month, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Russia had “noted the targeted efforts of Nato and other members of this alliance to involve Finland as well as Sweden [a fellow non-member] in this alliance"". She warned: ""We have seen this policy over a number of years... and Finland and Sweden should not base their security on damaging security of other countries. ""Their accession to Nato can have detrimental consequences... and face military and political consequences."" Part of Putin’s basis for war is to halt what he believes is a Nato advancement into eastern Europe, and demands that Ukraine changes its constitution so that it does not join either Nato or the EU. However, Ukraine was not on any formal path to joining Nato – a 30-member defensive alliance that includes nuclear powers like the US – before Putin invaded. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has now said his country ""must admit"" that it wouldn't join Nato. Speaking in a meeting with leaders of the Joint Expeditionary Force this week, Zelenskyy said: ""It is clear that Ukraine is not a member of Nato. We understand that. We are adequate people. ""For years, we have heard about the supposedly open door, but we have also heard that we should not enter, and this is true and we must admit it.” Boris Johnson has also said there is “no way Ukraine is going to join Nato anytime soon” as Zelenskyy said peace talks with Russia had taken a “realistic turn”. Johnson, speaking to broadcasters at the Emirates Palace hotel in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday, said: “I talked to Volodymyr (Zelenskyy) again yesterday and of course I understand what he is saying about Nato and the reality of the position. “And everybody has always said – and we’ve made it clear to Putin – that there is no way Ukraine is going to join Nato any time soon.” But Johnson said decisions about the future of the country had to “be for the Ukrainian people” and their “elected leader” to make, as he vowed Britain would continue to “back” Zelenskyy. It comes as UK foreign secretary Liz Truss urged allies to step up their measures against Moscow, as she called for those in opposition to the war to sanction Russia.
