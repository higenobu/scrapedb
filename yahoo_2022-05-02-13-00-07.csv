5/2/2022,"Netflix lost subscribers for the first time in a decade last quarter and expects to lose 2 million more.

The streamer credited its first subscription drop in over a decade to growing competition, password sharing, and macroeconomic factors such as inflation and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
