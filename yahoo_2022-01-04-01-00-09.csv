Why can’t we throw all our trash into a volcano and burn it up? – Georgine T. It’s true that lava is hot enough to burn up some of our trash. When Kilauea erupted on the Big island of Hawaii in 2018, the lava flows were hotter than 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit (1,100 Celsius). That’s hotter than the surface of the planet Venus, and hot enough to melt many rocks. It’s also as hot as waste incinerators, which usually burn garbage at 1,800 to 2,200 F (1,000-1,200 C). [Over 140,000 readers rely on The Conversation’s newsletters to understand the world. Sign up today.] But not all lavas are the same temperature. The eruptions in Hawaii produce a type of lava called basalt. Basalt is much hotter and more fluid than the lavas that erupt at other volcanoes, like the thicker dacite lava that erupts at Mount St. Helens in Washington state. For example, the 2004-2008 eruption at Mount St. Helens produced a lava dome with surface temperatures less than about 1,300 F (704 C). Beyond temperature, there are other good reasons not to burn our trash in volcanoes. First, although lava at 2,000 degrees F can melt many materials in our trash – including food scraps, paper, plastics, glass and some metals – it’s not hot enough to melt many other common materials, including steel, nickel and iron. Second, there aren’t many volcanoes on Earth that have lava lakes, or bowl-like craters full of lava, that we could dump trash into. Of all of the thousands of volcanoes on Earth, scientists know of only eight with active lava lakes. They include Kilauea, Mount Erebus in Antarctica and Nyiragongo in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Most active volcanoes have craters filled with rocks and cooled lava, like Mount St. Helens, or with water, like Crater Lake in Oregon. The third problem is that dumping trash into those eight active lava lakes would be a very dangerous job. Lava lakes are covered with a crust of cooling lava, but just below that crust they are molten and intensely hot. If rocks or other materials fall onto the surface of a lava lake, they will break the crust, disrupt the underlying lava and cause an explosion. This happened at Kilauea in 2015: Blocks of rock from the crater rim fell into the lava lake and caused a big explosion that ejected rocks and lava up and out of the crater. Anyone who threw garbage into a lava lake would have to run away and dodge flaming garbage and lava. Suppose it was possible to dump trash safely into a lava lake: What would happen to the trash? When plastics, garbage and metals burn, they release a lot of toxic gases. Volcanoes already give off tons of toxic gases, including sulfur, chlorine and carbon dioxide. Sulfur gases can create acidic fog, which we call “vog,” for “volcanic fog.” It can kill plants and cause breathing problems for people nearby. Mixing these already-dangerous volcanic gases with other gases from burning our trash would make the resulting fumes even more harmful for people and plants near the volcano. Finally, many indigenous communities view nearby volcanoes as sacred places. For example, Halema’uma’u crater at Kilauea is considered the home of Pele, the native Hawaiian goddess of fire, and the area around the crater is sacred to native Hawaiians. Throwing trash into volcanoes would be a huge insult to those cultures. Hello, curious kids! Do you have a question you’d like an expert to answer?

1/4/2022,"Gettr had a big day Sunday. Marjorie Taylor Greene posted on the Jason Miller-led social media platform after her permanent ban from Twitter, and podcaster Joe Rogan directed his Twitter followers to the site, too. “Just in case sh– over at Twitter gets even dumber, I’m here now as well,” he wrote on Gettr, which was founded by the former aide to Donald Trump and is increasingly popular with right-wing users. Rogan’s account on the site features numerous crossposts of his existing Twitter and Instagram content. On Twitter, he has about 7.8 million followers, so his push toward the new platform was notable. His “Join me on GETTR” tweet got over 10,000 retweets in less than 24 hours and prompted cryptocurrency guru Bryce Paul to respond, “RIP, Twitter.” Twitter permanently suspended Greene’s personal account on Sunday after the Republican congresswoman violated its COVID-19 misinformation policies for the fifth time. Her official Congressional account is still active, but its most recent post was made on Christmas Eve. Greene was briefly suspended for a week back in August for the same reasons. “We’ve been clear that, per our strike system for this policy, we will permanently suspend accounts for repeated violations of the policy,” a Twitter spokeswoman said in a statement. “When Maxine Waters can go to the streets and threaten violence on Twitter, Kamala and Ilhan can bail out rioters on Twitter, and Chief spokesman for terrorist IRGC can tweet mourning Soleimani but I get suspended for tweeting VAERS statistics, Twitter is an enemy to America and can’t handle the truth,” Greene wrote later on Gettr. “That’s fine, I’ll show America we don’t need them and it’s time to defeat our enemies.”",Politics/The Wrap,Joe Rogan Directs Followers to Gettr After Marjorie Taylor Greene’s Twitter Ban,https://news.yahoo.com/joe-rogan-directs-followers-gettr-142952062.html
1/4/2022,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - China, Russia, Britain, the United States and France have agreed that a further spread of nuclear arms and a nuclear war should be avoided, according to a joint statement by the five nuclear powers published by the Kremlin on Monday. It said that the five countries - who are the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council - consider it their primary responsibility to avoid war between the nuclear states and to reduce strategic risks, while aiming to work with all countries to create an atmosphere of security. ""We declare there could be no winners in a nuclear war, it should never be started,"" the Russian-language version of the statement read. ""As the use of nuclear arms would have far-reaching consequences, we also confirm that nuclear arms - as long as they exist - should serve defensive aims, deterrence against aggression and prevention of war."" France also released the statement, underscoring that the five powers reiterated their determination for nuclear arms control and disarmament. They would continue bilateral and multilateral approaches to nuclear arms control, it said. The statement comes amid increased geopolitical tensions between Moscow and Western nations over concerns about Russia's military build-up near neighbouring Ukraine. Moscow says it can move its army around its own territory as it deems necessary. Last Thursday U.S. President Joe Biden told his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin that a possible move on Ukraine will draw sanctions and an increased U.S. presence in Europe, where tensions are high after Russia's military buildup at the border.

1/4/2022,"DUBAI (Reuters) -Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi vowed revenge on Monday for the U.S. assassination of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani two years ago unless former U.S. President Donald Trump was put on trial. Iran and groups allied with it in Iraq have been holding events to honour Soleimani, the commander of the Quds Force, the overseas arm of the elite Revolutionary Guards. He was killed in Iraq in a drone strike on Jan. 3, 2020, ordered by then president Trump. ""If Trump and (former secretary of state Mike) Pompeo are not tried in a fair court for the criminal act of assassinating General Soleimani, Muslims will take our martyr's revenge,"" Raisi said in a televised speech on Monday. On Sunday, Iran urged the U.N. Security Council in a letter to hold the United States and Israel, which Tehran says was also involved in the killing, to account, according to Iranian media. Days after the assassination, the United States told the United Nations that the killing was self-defence and vowed to take additional action ""as necessary"" in the Middle East to protect U.S. personnel and interests.

1/4/2022,"After decades of hard work, Americans hope to retire rich enough to spend decades more enjoying their retirement. But if you ask financial guru Suze Orman, the average person will fall very, very short. Instead of lasting decades, their savings will last about three years. Right now, the median savings held in retirement accounts in the U.S. is just $65,000, according to a Federal Reserve study released in September 2020. Meanwhile, the government says households led by seniors 65 or older spend an average of about $47,600 a year. If you want more than three good years, Orman's book The Ultimate Retirement Guide for 50+ offers five essential rules to ensure a comfortable retirement. If you haven’t already, Orman says it’s time to buckle down and take a deep look through your budget. Compare what you’re spending to what you’re saving. Trim the fat where you can and cut back on any unnecessary spending so you can allocate more to your retirement savings column. Do you own a home and are you planning to stay in it through retirement? Then Orman says you need to come up with a plan now to ensure you’ll have your mortgage fully paid off before you retire. Not sure how? A mortgage refinance at today's still historically low interest rates could save you hundreds of dollars a month and make it possible to get out from under your home loan sooner. You may have plenty of sentimental reasons to want to stay in your current home, but if it’s more space than you need and you can make money off of it, you may want to consider selling now. Not waiting until you have to sell the house makes sense, Orman says, because if you invest the profits now, you’ll accrue much more interest than if you waited another 10 or 15 years. “I don’t want you to wait till you’re 60 or 70 to sell this home,” she says. “I want you to downsize right now, so that you can start saving more money right now.” While some may hesitate to part with their family homes, a smaller space is easier to clean, cheaper to run, will cost you less in homeowners insurance and will be more accessible as you age. Financial experts typically recommend you have an emergency fund of at least three to six months’ worth of living expenses, Orman actually recommends you make that two or three years. Yes, three years’ worth of expenses in an emergency fund. Her reasoning is that if the market ever takes a downturn, you’re not going to want to be withdrawing from your retirement accounts until it bounces back. With a substantial emergency fund you’ll be able to get by until it’s once again safe to take out funds from your retirement account. If you need a little help setting up your emergency fund, you might turn to one of today's convenient online financial planners. To avoid paying tax when you take money out of your retirement account, Orman recommends you go for a Roth IRA account. “Later on in life, you want to be able to take that money out tax-free,” she explains. Because your contributions to a Roth account are made after tax, you won’t have to deal with deductions when you withdraw. Traditional IRAs, on the other hand, aren’t taxed when you make contributions, so you end up paying later. Most banks and brokerage firms offer these accounts. And if you’re not keen on making the big investment decisions yourself, you could open an IRA through a robo-advisor that will manage your retirement account for you. One popular robo-advisor will even help you grow your savings by investing your ""spare change"" from everyday purchases. Taking a “set it and forget it” approach to your investment portfolio rarely pays off. You have to regularly revisit your portfolio and make sure it’s still in line with your financial goals and timelines. Orman recommends either stocks or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that pay dividends. So even if the market sees a downturn, your investments will still provide you some income. “If you happen to hit a patch where the market starts to go down, you want these stocks to still provide income for you,” she says. Check in with your financial adviser to ensure your balance of cash, stocks and bonds is right for your retirement goals. Try to keep your costs down by using an investing service that offers zero-commission trades. You might consider diversifying your investments by going way beyond stocks, maybe by putting some money into farmland or investing in fine art.
