3/20/2022,"Cal Moores, a 27-year-old graphic designer from the UK, shares his 12-week transformation story. I’ve always been into fitness and going to the gym, but I lacked the commitment and discipline to follow a diet and workout plan. This, along with my lack of gym knowledge, led me to doing the usual crash diets and sporadic workouts that obviously never led to any real results. I realised I wanted to make a change after the summer of 2021, as I’d been heavily involved in going out and socialising whilst watching England play in the Euros. It was the biggest I’d ever been, and it came from a lack of exercising and overindulging with junk food and alcohol. The weight gain seemed to happen without me even realizing. I knew I was letting my body get out of shape and it was knocking my confidence. I’m very active, I play football around five times a week, so you’d just assume I’d be in great shape and would be fit. That wasn’t the case for a long time as my diet was poor, and I was drinking a lot on the weekends, which really reflected on my body. I would feel so embarrassed getting changed after games; I think I’ve always subconsciously thought my teammates and people in the changing rooms would be expecting me to be in great shape when getting changed, when in reality I’d be hiding all this extra weight and not wanting anyone to know. When I started at Ultimate Performance, my diet changed massively. I’d gone from grabbing fast food after football to chicken and vegetables. I also began drinking protein shakes for breakfast, whereas it used to be whatever I could grab on the way into work in the mornings. I began really focusing on what I was putting into my body, and stuck to the program given to me by my trainer Nathan. Funnily enough, I was so much happier to be in a strict diet and routine, and it became normal to me. A typical day for me during my transformation would be a protein shake for breakfast, which included blueberries, spinach and peanut butter. Then I would have chicken or steak, with broccoli, green beans and sweetcorn for dinner and tea, followed by another protein shake in the evening. During my transformation I was working out three times a week doing a range of weight and core training, while also doing football training as my cardio. At the beginning of my training my mobility was really poor, I was struggling to do certain leg exercises due to my mobility, but Nathan gave me some tips and exercises to do that helped me, which in turn led me to being better on certain machines. At first I dreaded doing the Pendulum, but then I found it extremely beneficial and noticed it helped me massively in my football. I started out at 80kg (176 pounds), and managed to get down to around 67kg (147 pounds). I weighed myself every morning, and it was such a rewarding feeling knowing I was surpassing the goals that Nathan and I had set. My teammates had also started to notice a change in the changing rooms, which was great for me after being so shy about it after all these years. This experienced changed my life. I’m much more confident now in the gym as I have been taught the correct form so I am able to enjoy it. I’m still sticking to the diet, and I focus heavily on getting enough sleep to help me recover with training. Other positive side effects were my focus in work and my enthusiasm to work. I began becoming so much committed, I really noticed a positive output in my workflow and my enthusiasm to work. I think dieting well obviously helped, as I was feeling good and just mentally in a good place, leading to creating better work. I’m definitely not finished. My next goal now is to maintain a routine in the gym and make it a part of my life forever. I would honestly recommend getting a trainer to help you get started. I am so glad I met Nathan as I knew he would be right to help me achieve my goals. Prior to meeting him, I was in the gym working out incorrectly and just following fad diets and workout plans. Trainers can help you find a routine and tweak it to your needs, while giving you invaluable knowledge and tips that will last you forever.

3/20/2022,"The United States’ reactionary moves to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine suggest that it does not have an adequate plan in place to respond if Russian President Vladimir Putin decides to use a nuclear weapon, a former U.S. intelligence officer told Fox News. Rebekah Koffler, a former U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency agent and author of ""Putin's Playbook: Russia's Secret Plan to Defeat America,"" explained to Fox News that while the U.S. certainly has a strategic plan in place if Putin uses a nuclear weapon, recent responses to Russia’s aggression instill little confidence that the United States is doing the necessary preparation for such an outcome. RUSSIA CLAIMS TO HIT UKRAINE WITH HYPERSONIC MISSILE, EXPERT WARNS IT IS PART OF PUTIN’S ‘STRATEGIC PLAN’ Koffler said that ""the fact that we have not responded in a methodical manner to any of Putin’s actions nor have we deterred any of his actions"" is reason to be concerned that the United States does not have a coherent plan to respond to a potential nuclear attack. ""Judging by our overall response and that we put all our eggs in one basket with sanctions and we were caught off guard regardless of the fact Putin never made it a secret what he was going to do yet we are grasping at straws,"" Kofffler said. ""Given that, it doesn’t seem that we are prepared for the possibility of him using nuclear weapons."" ""The minute that Putin said he changed the combat readiness status we didn’t say anything,"" Koffler said. ""This whole confusion seems like a haphazard approach on our side."" Koffler says that the United States should be very active in putting together a contingency plan and establishing back channels to prevent Putin from de-escalating the war through escalation, a strategy Putin has developed over his years in power. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES As far as the likelihood that Putin would resort to using a nuclear weapon, Koffler says that Putin is capable of making such a drastic decision. ""He has high risk tolerance,"" Koffler said of Putin. ""I believe that it is within his frame of mind."" Russia claimed on Saturday that it deployed a hypersonic missile that destroyed a munitions warehouse in Ukraine, which Koffler said is part of a strategic plan Putin is using to show the world he has a ""high tolerance for warfare."" ""It's a game-changer in the geopolitical realm, not unlike in the military realm, because they're trying to [send a] strategic message,"" she said. ""In my assessment, [Putin] is climbing small steps in the escalation ladder on the trajectory to nuclear warfare."" ""We are so focused on thinking that it's so crazy and outside the realm of possibility,"" Koffler said about the potential use of a nuclear weapon. ""But think about all the crazy things he has already done. ""He invaded Crimea. He is now attacking Ukraine in the most brutal manner possible."" Koffler explained that the nuclear option isn’t necessarily one of the next steps Putin will take but that it can’t be ""ruled out"" because the further you ""drive Putin into the corner"" the more the ""probability increases because he has everything at stake right now.""",World/Fox News,US doesn't 'seem prepared' for possibility that Putin uses nuclear weapons: expert,https://news.yahoo.com/us-doesn-apos-t-apos-005448621.html

 House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) on Friday said Republicans would boot House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) from the committee altogether if they attain the majority in the midterm elections. At his press conference Friday, McCarthy accused Schiff of politicizing the committee, said he didn't warn the public about Ukraine or Afghanistan and alleged he lied about intelligence regarding President Biden's son Hunter Biden. ""Why is he still chair of the committee and why is he still even on the committee? In a new Congress, if it's a new majority, he will not be,"" McCarthy said. ""You cannot make this committee political, you cannot use it as a position of chairman to lie, and you should be focused on what the American people want you to be focused on around the world,"" he added. It's not the first time McCarthy has made a similar vow. He previously threatened to retaliate against Democrats for their votes in the last year to remove Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) from committees for invoking political violence in their rhetoric. In January, he said he'd remove Schiff and Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) from their respective committees.

3/20/2022,"The fifth-largest stockpile of gold in the world belongs to Russia, valued at nearly $140 billion. As with oil, sanctions are making it very difficult for Russia to trade the precious commodity. Demand for gold is still high within the country as the ruble has crashed to record lows. Like the price of crude oil, gold prices have been on a wild ride since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine. And like oil, Russia holds some of the world's largest reserves of gold — some 2,300 tons of it, worth nearly $140 billion. The huge reserves of the precious metal were built up over the past decade and a half, and were intended to be a sort of economic insurance policy for the country. But as with oil, sanctions are making it incredibly difficult for Russia to actually realize the value of its holdings. ""This is why they bought their gold, it was for a situation just like this,"" Cork University Business School lecturer Fergal O'Connor told Bloomberg. ""But if no one will trade it with you, it doesn't matter."" Last week, London's gold marketplace — the most important center in the world for bullion — banned all bars from Russian refineries, effectively shutting it out of the global trade. The US Senate followed that move with a new bill that would prohibit US citizens from making any transaction that involves Russian gold. ""Russia's massive gold supply is one of the few remaining assets that Putin can use to keep his country's economy from falling even further,"" Maine Sen. Angus King said in a statement. ""By sanctioning these reserves, we will further isolate Russia from the world's economy and increase the difficulty of Putin's increasingly-costly military campaign."" Even without international buyers, it appears domestic demand for gold is high, according to a statement from the central bank of Russia. On Tuesday, the bank said it will suspend its regular purchases of gold from lending institutions so as not to compete with household demand at a time when people are racing to exchange crashing rubles for gold bars. If the currency continues to fall relative to the US dollar, Credit Suisse strategist Zoltan Pozsar told Bloomberg that the country could use the stockpile to effectively revert to a gold-standard, using it as an ""anchor"" by selling it at a fixed price in rubles.

3/20/2022,"In Russia's latest swipe at foreign social media giants since it started a land war in Europe by invading Ukraine late last month, the country's internet censor has fired a warning shot at Google over what it describes as anti-Russian ""information attacks"" which it claims are being spread via YouTube -- accusing the U.S. tech giant of being engaged in acts ""of a terrorist nature"" by allowing ads on the video-sharing platform to be used to threaten Russian citizens. In a statement posted on its website today, Roskomnadzor claims YouTube has been serving targeted ads that call for people to disable railway links between Russia and Belarus. ""The actions of the YouTube administration are of a terrorist nature and threaten the life and health of Russian citizens,"" the regulator wrote [translated from Russian with machine translation]. ""The spread of such appeals clearly demonstrates the anti-Russian position of the American company Google LLC,"" it added. The regulator also warned Google to stop distributing ""anti-Russian videos as soon as possible"". Its statement goes on to accuse U.S. IT companies in general, and tech giants Google and Meta (Facebook's owner) in particular, of choosing a ""path of confrontation"" with Russia by launching a targeted campaign of ""information attacks"" that it says are intended to ""discredit the Russian Armed Forces, the media, public figures and the state as a whole"". ""Similar actions by Meta Platforms Inc. and Google LLC not only violate Russian law but also contradict generally accepted norms of morality,"" Roskomnadzor added. YouTube could not immediately be reached for comment on the warning from Roskomnadzor. The direct warning to Google from the state internet censor could be a precursor to Russia blocking access to YouTube. In recent days, Facebook and Instagram have both been blocked by Roskomnadzor -- as the Kremlin has sought to tighten its grip on the digital information sphere in parallel with its war in Ukraine. Facebook and Instagram were blocked after Meta said it was relaxing its hate speech policy to allow users in certain regions to post certain kinds of death threats aimed at Russia -- which Meta global affairs president, Nick Clegg, defended as a temporary change he said was designed to protect ""people’s rights to speech as an expression of self-defense"". In recent weeks, Roskomnadzor has also put restrictions on Twitter. But YouTube has escaped any major censorship since the Ukraine invasion, despite the company itself applying some limitations to its service in Russia -- such as suspending payment services for users (it took that action as a result of Western sanctions against Russian banks). In one signal that that could be about to change, a report in Russian press today suggests a block is looming, citing sources close to Roskomnadzor who told it YouTube could be blocked as soon as today or next week. RIA Novosti's sources told it a block of YouTube is ""most likely"" by the end of next week. In what may be another small indicator of the cyber war that's now fiercely raging between Russia and Ukraine, Roskomnadzor's website was noticeably slow to load as we were filing this report today. It also appears to have introduced a CAPTCHA request -- suggesting it may be trying to prevent and/or mitigate DDoS attacks.
