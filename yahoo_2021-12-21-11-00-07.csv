12/21/2021,"After the Ada County Highway District and city of Boise disagreed on the design of a 19-story building, the developer came up with a compromise. Hovde Properties, of Madison, Wisconsin, had proposed that the Ovation apartment building at 521 W. Front St. include a parking garage entrance and exit on Broad Street. Since Boise wants that to be a “festival street,” city officials appealed ACHD’s approval of that location for garage access. The city’s preference was for garage access on 6th Street. While ACHD didn’t accept Boise’s appeal, Hovde Properties offered the alternative of a one-way parking garage entrance on Broad Street and a one-way exit on 6th Street. Boise’s Design Review Committee unanimously voted to accept the compromise on Dec. 8 and added the language to the project’s conditions of approval. Boise planner Josh Wilson called it “an excellent compromise and alternative for the project.” Wilson said ACHD supports the new idea. Though resolved, the issue served as another flashpoint in the occasionally tense relationship between ACHD and the city. As far back as its inception in 1972, ACHD has dealt with critics in city leadership positions. Former Mayor David Bieter called ACHD a “failed model.” Caught in the middle was the developer, who had to figure out how to navigate the unusual structure of the different agencies. “I think the outcome is a great outcome for all. Trying to take everybody’s concerns into balance,” Hovde Properties President Randy Guenther said in a video interview. “… It was compromise on both sides, but everybody still focused on safety of people and traffic, and because the one-way exit on 6th Street is only an exit, it really eliminated a lot of the issues of the entry and exit on 6th Street.” With the changes, the width of the garage access on Broad Street is planned to be reduced from 28 feet to 18 feet, and solid waste and overhead access doors would be moved from Broad Street to 6th Street. That opens more space for ground-floor storefront access on Broad. ACHD, the agency with the final say on where garage entrances and exits can be located, didn’t allow both the entrance and exit to be moved to 6th Street. ACHD’s policy says properties with frontage on multiple streets should have driveways on the street with less traffic. Allowing the one-way exit only on 6th Street was as far as ACHD was willing to bend, Wilson said. Guenther said he’s become accustomed to working with different agencies to solve problems related to his company’s buildings. The wrinkle in Boise is having roadways run by an agency not controlled by the city. And the dispute threatened Guenther’s desired timeline to begin construction in June 2022 and complete it by the spring of 2024. Now that the Design Review Committee approved the plans, the project won’t need any future government votes to move forward. The project won’t appear in front of the Planning and Zoning Commission because it’s in a zone that allows for this kind of building. The Ovation building is planned to have 209 units. It’s among many large planned downtown projects. The 27-story Oppenheimer project with 297 apartments has been proposed at 1115 W. Idaho St. A 12-story senior apartment project with 160 apartments is planned at 601 S. 8th St. On Dec. 13, a developer’s plan to build a 20-story building with 450 apartments at 1010 W. Jefferson St. won the support of Boise’s urban renewal agency. “I want to thank the applicant for putting up with governmental bureaucracy,” Design Review Committee member Dana Zuckerman said during the Dec. 8 meeting, “and having to deal with several agencies who are not always on the same page. I appreciate your cooperation in this.” The issue reached a boiling point at a Dec. 1 ACHD meeting, when commissioners raised their voices and briefly spoke over each other during a lengthy discussion about the topic. Christy Little, an ACHD development services manager, presented to the commission and explained that the decision to allow garages on Broad Street was made by ACHD’s staff in August, and reversing course now would require Hovde Properties to redesign the site. At the Dec. 1 meeting, Wilson said Hovde Properties initially proposed access on Broad Street when the application was submitted in June. The city staff didn’t raise concerns about this until August after “stakeholder discussions,” Wilson said. Before the compromise that was reached, Guenther consistently advocated for access on Broad Street. Guenther said at the Dec. 1 meeting that his company was stuck in “a very precarious position,” and a redesign would cost “several hundred thousand dollars.” “It was a challenge. The challenge was to find a way for both governmental agencies to meet their objectives,” Guenther told the Statesman. “I wouldn’t use the word frustration. We want to move forward with our project, and we want to find a solution. … Everybody put their heads together and figured it out.” The city of Boise preferred 6th Street access because of the desire to make Broad Street more pedestrian friendly, which is outlined in its Central Addition Master Plan. Little said she could not apply that master plan because it’s Boise’s and not ACHD’s. She also pointed out that most streets with parking garages in downtown Boise similarly have significant pedestrian movement. “We have to have driveways somewhere,” Little said. “And ‘festival street’ doesn’t necessarily imply the street is always going to be closed or that it’s a heavier-than-normal focus on pedestrians.” The ACHD staff recommended that the commission deny the appeal, because the city of Boise was not the applicant, the August approval met ACHD criteria, and the staff had no basis to require a 6th Street driveway. Commissioner Jim Hansen argued that this was a land-use issue, and it would be a “a huge disservice to the taxpayers” if ACHD didn’t recognize the city’s concerns. ACHD Commission President Kent Goldthorpe said the conflict in policies “is so highly unusual as to almost never have happened before in the history of this agency.” ACHD commissioners said they would have been willing to work with the city to make note of Boise’s master plans in advance. Goldthorpe said he thought the city would be inclined to communicate earlier to avoid a potential conflict like this. “We have a conflicting set of policies, which, in my opinion, we’ve had our policies for a long time,” Goldthorpe said. “When another of our partners changes the policy themselves, somebody needs to tell the other one. I’m not sure that we should be holding the bag, if that’s the right wording, or take any blame whatsoever for the policies being in conflict.” Guenther navigated a tricky disagreement. “Everybody’s intentions are in the right place, they want a great product, they want the character of the city to be something special,” Guenther said. “We agree with that. We’re totally in alignment on Broad Street. We think that’s a great asset. That’s part of the reason we liked the site with some of the initiatives there.” This apartment building proposed in heart of downtown would be one of Boise’s tallest These downtown apartments would be the biggest new project in Boise agency’s history This just-proposed Boise building would be Idaho’s tallest.

12/21/2021,"A couple visiting Myrtle Beach from Florida is suing, claiming they were bit by bed bugs while staying at a hotel on Ocean Boulevard. Jacob and Nicole Makins were staying at the South Bay Inn & Suites Myrtle Beach Oceanfront when they were bit by bed bugs which returned with the couple to Florida and caused an infestation in their home, according to a lawsuit they filed in Horry County Court this month. The Makins stayed at the hotel Sept. 21-25, according to the lawsuit filed against Grand Strand Hotels, LLC and South Bay Inn & Suites Myrtle Beach Oceanfront. The Makins said they were bit by bed bugs while they slept, according to the filing. The bed bugs, which were in the mattresses, bedding and carpet of their hotel room, traveled with the couple and caused an infestation in their Hernando County, Florida home, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit states that the hotel’s operators knew or could have known “through the exercise of reasonable care” that the room rented to the Makins were infested with bed bugs. The Makins argued that the South Bay Inn & Suites failed to uphold the rental agreement by neglecting to provide the Makins with a “reasonable safe and clean” room. When contacted via telephone by The Sun News, South Bay Inn & Suites declined to comment for the story. The lawsuit states that the Makins’ experience with bed bugs will require psychological and psychiatric medical care treatment. The infestation also caused the Makins to incur medical expenses and lost wages, they said. The Makins have asked for an undisclosed amount of money to cover damages and legal fees. Last year, pest control company Orkin ranked Myrtle Beach among the 50 worst cities for bed bugs across the country. The list was based on data from the areas where Orkin performed the most bed bug treatment.",U.S./Myrtle Beach Sun News,"Lawsuit: Florida couple bit by bed bugs in Myrtle Beach hotel, then got infested at home",https://news.yahoo.com/lawsuit-florida-couple-bit-bed-191152712.html
12/21/2021,"Severe weather could arrive in Florida early this week as storms are forecast to bring cooler weather and rain in the days before Christmas, according to AccuWeather and the National Weather Service. Even if the system pushing through the state is a moderate one, it could bring heavy, gusty thunderstorms that are expected to become severe for some in central and southern Florida from Monday night to Tuesday. ""There is little doubt that a portion of the Southeastern states will get a thorough soaking from the storm into Tuesday, but there is some question as to how extensive the shield of rain will be,"" AccuWeather Meteorologist Tony Zartman said. Traveling for the holidays?: Here are the worst times to hit the road 'It was out of my hands': Babies survive Kentucky tornado that carried them away in bathtub If the storm strengthens quickly, a severe weather outbreak could evolve that includes some supercell thunderstorms capable of producing a few tornadoes over Florida. The system approaching Florida garnered a tweet from meteorologist Jim Cantore, who tweeted parts of Florida could get soaked Tuesday, especially along and south of Interstate 4. Brief downpours may extend as far south as the Miami area and the Florida Keys Tuesday afternoon and evening, bringing with them a threat for waterspouts. By Wednesday and through the rest of the week, dry weather and sunshine is expected to return. Airports may face some delays due to lightning or severe thunderstorms, while motorists could face reduced visibility and the threat of hydroplaning, along with localized flooding. At this time, it appears areas from northern and central Florida could receive 0.50 of an inch to 1 inch of rain, with locally higher amounts spanning Monday night to Tuesday night, forecasters said. The stronger the storm becomes and the speed at which it strengthens will have an impact on how far north and west the rain would reach, Zartman said.
