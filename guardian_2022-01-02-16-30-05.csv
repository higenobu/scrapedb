1/2/2022,"Fresh proof that the Nazis set up fake auctions and phoney paperwork to disguise their looting of art and valuable possessions has been uncovered by an amateur sleuth researching her own family mystery. French writer Pauline Baer de Perignon’s investigation has revealed the fate of a missing collection of art that included work by Monet, Renoir and Degas and also exposed the reluctance of Europe’s leading museums to accept evidence of the deceit.  Baer was prompted to look into the past when she bumped into an English cousin who told her he believed the family had been “robbed”. “The whole thing has changed my life,” said Baer this weekend. “I have had to look back at a long-forgotten family story as well as at the hidden secrets of the Gestapo. And then I had to confront the truth about paintings held by galleries such as the Louvre and the state museum in Dresden. I was so naive when I started.” Baer’s three years of research have led not just to a better understanding of the way in which significant works of art were systematically stolen after Germany invaded France, but will culminate later this month in the high-profile sale of a recovered painting at Sotheby’s in New York. Portrait of a Lady as Pomona, by the revered 18th-century French artist Nicolas de Largillière, once belonged to her great-grandfather, the Parisian collector Jules Strauss, and was only returned to his descendants last year. It is now expected to sell for $1m-$1.5m (£750,000-£1.1m). “I could have asked my father to tell me about Jules Strauss, but I never did,” Baer has explained. “My father died when I was 20, before I was bold enough to ask him about the war, about his parents and grandparents, about his emotions and his memories.” Baer’s curiosity was aroused when she bumped into her cousin Andrew Strauss at a concert in Paris eight years ago. The two had not met since she was a teenager, but he told her that he worked at Sotheby’s and believed the apparent sale of the Strauss collection in the early 1940s was “shady”. He mentioned the involvement of dummy companies, Nazi officers and museum inventories to his bemused cousin. “Andrew’s words sent my mind tumbling down a rabbit hole,” said Baer. Armed with a scribbled note listing the names of famous artists, Baer began to piece together the lost past. She was now as interested in finding out what happened to her distant family members as in the fate of the missing art. A book about her efforts, The Vanished Collection, has already made waves in France, where it was published last year and where critics have compared it to a compelling suspense novel. A reviewer for Elle said it was as “devourable as a thriller”, while others have compared the family’s story to those of other famous Jewish families whose art was looted in the war, such as the Camondos, the Rothschilds and the Ephrussis. At the start of Baer’s inquiries, all she had was one photograph of Strauss, her illustrious great-grandfather, and another of the many portraits hanging on the walls of his former home on Avenue Foch in Paris. She knew the apartment had gone, but that there was one elderly living relative with first-hand knowledge of what had happened. She delved into the archives of great museums and asked difficult questions of the French ministry of culture. She was surprised to discover how the thefts had been covered up, but her English translator, Natasha Lehrer, believes the most powerful part of the book concerns howmodern art institutions have dragged their feet and, at worst, avoided doubts about the ownership of important paintings. “What Pauline stumbled upon was an apparent unwillingness among those leading various large state museums to admit that they were holding looted works of art until very recently,” said Lehrer. “This despite the fact that families and collectors often had all the provenance information available to identify them as the rightful owners. There has been a notable reluctance to return artworks.” The English version of Baer’s book is to be published next month by Head of Zeus. Baer tracked down the portrait by Largillière to Dresden’s state art collections and found archival evidence to prove that Strauss had been forced to sell it. The masterpiece had apparently been acquired in 1941 for the Reichsbank in Berlin and then transferred to the ministry of finance, before going to Dresden in 1959. Baer found the words “Collection Jules Strauss” next to the Largillière’s listing in the German Lost Art Foundation, but was then told that the Dresden museum’s director was not minded to return it. She was questioned about whether Strauss was originally happy to sell, despite evidence of laws that prevented Jews from profiting by such deals. “The more I continued with my investigation, the more I realised how unlikely it was that Jules had been able to avoid his collection becoming seized by the Nazis,” said Baer. “Even before the invasion of France, the Germans had compiled a list of large French collections.” Dresden’s state art collections has since said: “The investigation of this complex case was as extensive and thorough as is necessary to ensure that a work of art is returned to its rightful owner.” The portrait’s sale in New York this month will now allow all 20 of Strauss’s heirs a share in its value. Painted between 1710 and 1714, when Largillière was at the height of his powers, the sitter for the portrait is thought to be Marie Madeleine de La Vieuville, the Marquise de Parabère, mistress of Philippe II, Duc d’Orléans. She is depicted as Pomona, the Roman goddess of fruit and abundance. Strauss, a Frankfurt-born banker, built an extraordinary collection of art, ranging from antiques to the Impressionists, while he was in Paris. It is now clear that much of it was then stolen or forcibly sold by the Nazis.",Arts/Art and design,Retrieved after decades: the painting supposedly ‘bought’ by the Nazis,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/02/retrieved-after-decades-the-painting-supposedly-bought-by-the-nazis
1/2/2022,"Guilty, five times over, Ghislaine Maxwell, shackled, sits in the sweat box as it crawls over Brooklyn Bridge along with the rest of the rush-hour little people she used to fly over, saying a last goodbye to the Imperial City’s billion-dollar stalagmites. The one-time Princess Mwah-Mwah is now the Demon Queen, facing 30 years, the rest of her life in prison, not some Disneyland of rightwing fantasy but a bone pit of the bad, the mad and the broken locked up until the end of age. She has a secret key that could unlock her shackles. What if she sings, tells the feds what she knows, gives up the overmighty men who, along with her one-time lover Jeffrey Epstein, abused women more child than adult back in her pomp? She could cut her jail time down to 10 years and be out in seven, thanks to good behaviour.  But to do that, Maxwell – once the bosom pal of the second son of the Queen of England, two US presidents, and our prime minister, Boris Johnson, on the word of his sister, Rachel – would have to admit that she had been Epstein’s $30m pimp, that she treated a host of underage women as nothings, trash, that she did great wrong, that she was sorry. No sign of that. I do feel pity for Maxwell, for the dark chasm between how her life was and the wretched place she is in now but her lack of remorse, her failure to address reality, her unwillingness to express a smidgen of regret to her victims hardens the heart. And therein lies her tragedy, the darkest fairytale of modern times. Her first chance at coming clean was in 2002 when reporter Vicky Ward was checking out claims by Annie Farmer, who said that in 1996, when she was 16, she was flown to Epstein’s Zorro ranch in New Mexico where, her story goes, she was sexually abused by Maxwell and Epstein. She tricked Farmer, giving the teenager a massage. It became sexual, then Farmer realised the door was open, her fear being that Epstein was standing in the dark, watching. Later, Epstein came into Farmer’s bed but she resisted, then fled. To Ward, Maxwell said: “I can guarantee that I didn’t give her a massage… Why do you say this? Some kid who just says she came to the ranch that I gave a massage to… It’s wrong. OK? It is wrong! I don’t like the implication of what you’re saying either, for the record. At all. I don’t like it at all. Disgusting.” That story never ran until far too late. Ward, by the way, went on to blog in 2011 that she admired Epstein and: “I like Ghislaine, everyone does.” No one at all who knew Maxwell back in the day comes out of this story well. Maxwell’s second chance to set evil to rights was in October 2005 when the Palm Beach police department raided Epstein’s house on El Brillo Way. The socialite who got a countess to write a 50-page manual on such things as how full a box of tissues had to be before it was thrown away – half – never noticed the fresh child factory production line of underage girls coming and going. But she would have registered the fact of the police raid, surely? Would, perhaps, have wondered what had happened to all the house’s computer hard drives, including, one would think, her own, when they were mysteriously removed before the raid, as if a bent copper in on the police investigation had forewarned Team Epstein? Nothing from Maxwell then. Not a word in 2007 when she got her final dollop of Epstein’s $30m, a single $7m transfer for a helicopter to be owned by her own company. Silence in 2008 when her ex Epstein was convicted of procuring an underage girl for prostitution, effectively that he was a paedophile. She was still taking his money in 2009, by her own account. In 2016 she swore on oath, in a civil suit brought by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, that there had been no underage sex, nothing to see here, folks. She was still watching the paedophile’s back. Silence, too, in 2019 when Epstein was arrested a second time in July and in August when he killed himself in jail. Instead of facing the music, Maxwell ran, only to be caught and tried. She could have told the jury that she was innocent, that the four women who said they had been abused were making it up, as were their three boyfriends, as was the butler, Juan Alessi, as was the chain of photographs showing an intimacy from the early 90s, as was the chain of money transfers proving that Epstein paid her $30m over eight years for being a fancy janitor. Instead, she held her tongue, only telling the judge: “The government has not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. So there is no need for me to testify.” Her bark of arrogant command echoed her father, Robert Maxwell, the first monster in her life, a man who stole £400m from his pensioners, who took pride in pissing off the roof of his helicopter pad in the heart of London, who evacuated his bowels within earshot of reporters, who used to wipe his bottom with cloth towels and let the maids pick them up. Her pattern of denial over two decades suggests that his daughter will find it impossible to do a plea bargain with the feds and so her future looks impossibly bleak. And that can only be down to her – and the rest of the Maxwell family. Questioned about the evidence against her on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, her brother Ian Maxwell said that conditions in her remand prison were grim. We all agree. But Maxwell in court looked fantastic, as if she had stepped off a yacht. Brothers Ian and Kevin both hit their stride, proclaiming their sister’s innocence, Kevin saying “she is not the Demon Queen”. One can only ask why did Epstein pay her $30m? The prosecution case was, simply put, that no 16-year-old girl would fly to the middle of nowhere in New Mexico to spend a weekend with Epstein but if her mother were told that Maxwell was going to be there, then you might. The same goes for the other three victims: Jane and Kate and Carolyn. Maxwell got her $30m and in return she provided cover for the paedophile. I sat through the evidence and came to the conclusion that she was as guilty as sin. So did the other reporters. So did the jury. That said, it makes one deeply uneasy that while Maxwell is facing a long, slow, grey death inside, the alpha males in our dark fairytale are walking free. The presidents, the prince, the famous Harvard lawyer, the Wall Street masters of the universe, the scientists with brains the size of planets, hobnobbed with Epstein and Maxwell, many on the Lolita Express, some on Paedo Island in the US Virgin Islands. They all deny doing or seeing anything untoward. True, none of the under-age women say they were sexually abused by Trump and Clinton. Harvard lawyer Alan Dershowitz vehemently denies wrongdoing but he has questions to answer. His primary accuser, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, stands by her story that she was required to have sex with him on multiple occasions. She also accuses Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, saying she was forced to have sex with him three times in 2001 and there is a photograph that shows they met. For the moment, Andrew Windsor denies all, as convincingly as a gimp photographed in a gimp suit denying he’s a gimp. Virginia’s lawyers are asking him to prove that she was wrong to say that he was a sweaty dancer because he can’t sweat. My friend Ashley Grossman, professor of neuro-endocrinology at Oxford, thinks the prince’s claim nonsense. Virginia was 17 when she was trafficked from Florida to London. If only there was some kind of police body in London that could investigate… The dark fairytale of Ghislaine Maxwell isn’t over, not by a long chalk.

1/2/2022,"In their terrific new book, the veteran reporters Mark Bowden and Matthew Teague argue that the mob that invaded the Capitol in Washington almost exactly a year ago “had no more chance of overthrowing the US government than hippies in 1967 had trying to levitate the Pentagon”.  The “real insurrection” was the one “led by Trump and his coterie of sycophants” in Georgia, Wisconsin, Nevada, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Arizona. It “was only slightly better organized than the mob but considerably more calculated and dangerous”. That real insurrection is the subject of this timely and important volume. The authors have used a stethoscope to examine the minutia of the American election process. The result is a thrilling and suspenseful celebration of the survival of democracy. The attempted coup was led by Donald Trump. Its intended denouement, in which the vice-president, Mike Pence, would ignore the votes of the six states above plus Washington DC in order to swing the election to Trump, was outlined in an insane memo written by the lawyer John Eastman, described here as “surely the most seditious document to emerge from the White House in American history”. That final act, of course, never happened. Not even Pence, the most sycophantic vice-president of modern times, could bring himself to violate the constitution so blatantly to keep his boss in the White House. But the genuine heroes, brought to life here, were the “hundreds of obscure Americans from every walk of life, state and local officials, judges and election workers. Many of them were Republicans, some were Trump supporters. They refused to accept his slander of themselves, their communities and their workers, and they refused to betray their sworn duty to their office and their country. They were the real patriots.” Bowden and Teague – the latter a Guardian contributor – take us through six battles that lasted from the night of the election, 3 November 2020, until Joe Biden’s election was finally certified by Congress early on 7 January last year. Their book performs a vital service, demonstrating just how well our tattered democracy managed to function despite vicious partisanship and all the new challenges created by the pandemic. For the first time, I understood how brilliantly new machines used to count the votes performed, the intricacies of opening outer and inner envelopes, capturing the images of both then preserving the vital paper ballots inside, making it possible to confirm electronic results with a hand count in case of any failure in technology. In Arizona, the elections department conducted “the mandatory hand count of election day ballots from 2% of the vote centers and 1% of the early ballots as required by Arizona law and it yielded a 100% match to the results produced by the tabulation equipment”. Scott Jarrett was co-director of elections in the populous Maricopa county, and he is one of the crucial bureaucrats celebrated here: “A pale slender young man … dressed in a plain gray suit, the very picture of an earnest functionary, a man happily engaged in the actual machinery of government and quietly proud of his own unheralded importance and competence.” In a public hearing crowded with crazed conspiracy theorists, Jarrett carefully explained how only one of the two “encrypted memory cards (both with tamper-proof evidence seals)” was transported from various polling centers to the main counting location, “so that the results on one card could be double-checked against the other as well as the precinct ballot report they had generated. Backing up that memory were, of course, the actual ballots that had been run through the machines. The memory cards and the ballots were sealed and delivered by “two members of different parties”, escorted by county sheriffs. Clint Hickman, chairman of the Maricopa county board of supervisors, noted that if the eyes of some in the audience were glazing over, he just wanted “people that are watching this” to understand “we don’t glaze over”. The authors point out that Hickman was touching on a fundamental feature of The Steal, the factitious narrative concocted by Trump and his cronies: conspiracy theorists depend on ignorance. “They begin with distrust: only a sucker believes the official story. They then replace the often tedious, mundane details of an intricate process … with a simpler narrative”: theft. They invent colorful stories about a “deal struck with a late Venezuelan dictator to deliver tainted election machines, or a plot to preprint fake ballots in the dead of night”. This creates what cognitive scientists call “a community of knowledge”. The big problem that didn’t exist even 30 years ago is the speed with which such idiotic stories are spread through the internet and by the Twitter feed of a malevolent president like Trump, exploding the reach of such stories and their power to undermine democratic norms. The book reminds us that democracy itself depends on a modicum of trust. That is why Trump’s ability to persuade so many Americans of the truth of so many lies has had such a disastrous effect on our body politic. Bowden and Teague have performed a singular service by revealing the details that disprove Republicans’ unceasing inventions about voter fraud. The problem is that so many Republicans will continue to ignore the lessons of this book. American democracy could still be destroyed by the torrent of voter suppression laws already passed by Republican-controlled state legislatures, spurred by lies invented by Trump and amplified by insidious “journalists” like Maria Bartiromo and Tucker Carlson, whose perfidy is brilliantly dissected in these pages. If democracy does prevail, it will survive because of the ability of authors like Teague and Bowden to make the truth even more compelling than Fox News fictions.

1/2/2022,"In more innocent or credulous days, the faithful sat in the dark to gaze at strange beings with detachable heads who were actually phantasms of light. Among the stars in this custom-made galaxy, the most alluring and yet the most distant was Greta Garbo, whose persona alternated between carnal heat and ascetic frost. After wickedly enticing her male victims in The Temptress, she redeemed herself as the dying courtesan in Camille; in Queen Christina, she was exalted by sacrifice and in a last mesmerising closeup all emotion blankly drained from her face as she renounced the throne and sailed into exile. Gradually this astral creature edged down to Earth. Publicists issued an excited proclamation when Garbo talked for the first time on screen in Anna Christie, even though she began by gruffly demanding a whisky in a waterfront bar. In Ninotchka, she made headlines all over again by contorting her alabaster features in a sudden fit of laughter.  Then, in 1941, she abruptly abandoned her career. Middle-aged fault lines in her perfect countenance have usually been blamed, but Robert Gottlieb’s book points to a change in the temper of the times. The young Fellini, puzzled by Garbo’s lunar pallor, mistook her for a ghost. In wartime, movie goddesses had to be less ethereal: they were now called bombshells because pilots painted their bodies on to the fuselage of the planes they flew into battle. Wispy and tremulous, Garbo lacked the ballistic sexual impact of Rita Hayworth in Gilda and unlike the pistol-packing Joan Crawford she was no spitfire. “I had made enough faces,” Garbo remarked when explaining why she quit. She knew herself to be a product, not a person, and disowned the mystique manufactured by the studio. The surname that MGM assigned to her was supposed to be Swedish for sprite, although alliteration prompted impish schoolboys to nickname her Greasy Garbage. “You are in love with Garbo,” she told her besotted co-star John Gilbert, implying that he would not have been so infatuated by Greta Gustafsson from Stockholm, a shy mouse who late in life jokingly offered to work behind the counter in a Scandinavian deli near her New York apartment. Affecting anonymity in retirement, she insisted on being addressed as Miss Brown. Despite a succession of lovers, Garbo’s only long-term relationship, as Gottlieb says, was with the lens. She surrendered gladly to the Hollywood cameramen who trapped her soul on emulsion; later, she had to fend off paparazzi who stalked her in the street and tried to penetrate her disguises. When Chaplin became the most recognisable man in the world, he chummily acknowledged the applause of the multitudes. But Garbo fled from crowds in genuine terror and felt no sense of charitable obligation to her fans; it’s alleged that she even refused to sign an autograph book pitifully proffered by a soldier who was in uniform and on crutches. Some called her divine, while for others she was a demon. A photograph by Clarence Sinclair Bull superimposes her imperishable head on the recumbent body of the Sphinx, which crumbles in the Egyptian desert. In Mata Hari, she performs an orientalised belly dance, dressed as a profane priestess and wearing a pagoda-shaped hat. Her earliest American films cast her as a vamp, a successor to the bewitching Theda Bara, whose invented name was an anagram of Arab death; the widow of Garbo’s saturnine protector George Schlee called her “that vampire” and after Schlee died, summoned a Russian Orthodox priest to exorcise their fridge because, when the purported blood drinker visited, she sometimes reached into it to grab a can of beer. Favouring men’s shoes and clothes, Garbo cultivated a teasing androgyny and one of the later projects with which she toyed was an adaptation of Oscar Wilde’s The Picture of Dorian Gray in which she would play the ageless, cruelly insensitive dandy; for the nubile actor who commits suicide when seduced and then spurned by Dorian, she wanted Marilyn Monroe. Envious and venomous, Marlene Dietrich boosted the emasculating myth by claiming that Garbo “raped men, she unzipped her fly and pounced on them”. Garbo retaliated with hazy hauteur. “Who is this Marlene Dietrich?” she once asked a reporter. Gottlieb is a renowned New York editor who at the age of 90 has earned the right to be self-indulgent and he chats wittily about his idol while leaving others to do the hard work of analysing Garbo’s appeal. In a small anthology of critical comments, Kenneth Tynan’s empurpled rhapsody about her physique – a neck that could be tilted at right angles to her spine, concave pectorals, a wayward, loping walk – is supplemented by a mystical reverie in which David Thomson regrets that “the church of cinema” where Garbo’s worshippers gathered has now been deconsecrated. The Swedish actor Fritiof Billquist contributes a sharp insight that makes sense of her craving for solitary boredom and domestic banality, a condition she attained in her long, vacuous phone monologues about paying bills and shopping for groceries. “Hers,” Billquist says, “was the artistic nature’s jealousy of real life.” Best of all, Gottlieb dispenses with words in a gallery of photographs in which Garbo cups her head like the calyx of a flower, lowers her eyelids to semaphore desire or perhaps drowsiness and smokes a cigarette as if lighting a candle to place on her own altar. The mutable human face is saved from decay and flesh and blood are somehow sculpted into the likeness of Pallas Athene.  Garbo by Robert Gottlieb is published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux (£32).

1/2/2022,"This picture of a young couple arriving at Gatwick airport from the Caribbean on 30 June 1962 was taken on the evening before the Commonwealth Immigrants Act came into force. The act had been passed by Harold Macmillan’s Conservative government to halt the flow of citizens from current and former British colonies. It was designed in particular to bring to an abrupt end the “open door” welcome for people from the West Indies – characterised by the arrival of the Empire Windrush in 1948 – to help rebuild the so-called “mother country” after the war. Macmillan had been under pressure from his militant backbenchers, some in the newly formed far-right Monday Club, to introduce the bill. Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell called it “cruel and brutal anti-colour legislation”. The couple in the picture, striding confidently across the tarmac from their BOAC plane in their Sunday clothes, therefore represent perhaps the last moment that Commonwealth citizens from the Caribbean arrived in Britain with unclouded hope. In the subsequent decade, two further immigration bills tightened the legislation against the free movement of families, and the subject became an emotive and divisive political issue right up to the present moment, with the draconian nationality and borders bill passing through parliament.  This photograph is included in an exhibition, Changing the Story, that uses pictures from the TopFoto archive to challenge received ideas of the “whiteness” of Britain after the first world war. The exhibition, brought to life by poet and performer Rommi Smith, includes images from between 1917 and 1962 that question the monocultural stereotypes of nation that conservative forces promoted. “I open the album and am spellbound,” Smith writes of encountering this archive. “I am immediately struck that what unites these stories of people and places across time and space is the racial diversity of the protagonists in them. These photos flip the script on Britishness: my history lessons did not look like this.” Changing the Story: Photographs of British Life in Black and White, 1917-1962 is at the North Wall Arts Centre, Oxford, 10-29 January",Arts/Art and design,"The big picture: last call for Commonwealth arrivals, 1962",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/02/the-big-picture-last-call-for-commonwealth-arrivals-1962

Laura Cumming A welcome addition to cinemas in the coming months is a collection of stroppy, unpredictable, unreliable and thoroughly difficult women.

Depictions of women have been freed up by a rejection of the traditional good versus bad mother binary, in films such as Maggie Gyllenhaal’s The Lost Daughter (now on Netflix) and Pedro Almodóvar’s Parallel Mothers (28 January). In the former, Olivia Colman’s self-described “unnatural mother” abandons her children for several years to pursue her career; in the latter, Penélope Cruz’s character, facing an impossible situation, makes all the wrong choices. But, crucially, neither is portrayed as a villain. Meanwhile, Harry Wootliff’s True Things (11 March) and Joachim Trier’s The Worst Person in the World (25 March) embrace the chaos of relationships and the car crash of career ambitions.

At the Bridge theatre in London from 16 March to 18 June, Ralph Fiennes stars in David Hare’s Straight Line Crazy, a portrait of Robert Moses, “for 40 years the most powerful man in New York”, at first regarded as an idealist, later as an intimidating manipulator with a divisive vision of city life. SC The Burrell Collection in Glasgow is a quirky but brilliant building designed around both its parkland setting and a personal, magnificent and eclectic array of objects – a Romanesque arch, for example, is built into its fabric. In March, 39 years after the building was completed, it will reopen with a revamp by John McAslan + Partners. The challenge is to update it without losing its soul. Also due in March is the new campus for the Royal College of Art in Battersea in south London, composed of rugged-looking brickwork, by the Swiss architectural powerhouse Herzog & de Meuron (authors of Tate Modern, the Beijing Olympic stadium). In February, a brand new theatre will open (not something you see every day): the Brixton House in south London. Its architects, Foster Wilson Size, a practice with a number of performance spaces under their belt, promise a “purposefully robust” and adaptable building, “in keeping with the spirit of studio theatre”. Rowan Moore We only saw Tilda Swinton in one film (one-and-a-half, counting Almodóvar’s short The Human Voice) in 2021, making it a fallow year by the prolific star’s standards. The year 2022, however, is serving us a double scoop of Swinton genius straight off the bat. As a woman journeying into the Colombian jungle to seek the origin of a psychological disturbance, she’s on mesmerising, minimalist form in Thai auteur Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s dreamy experiment Memoria (14 January), while she tenderly supports her real-life daughter Honor Swinton Byrne in Joanna Hogg’s exquisite autofiction follow-up, The Souvenir Part II (4 February). Guy Lodge Contemporary art shows include the witty and spatially complex figurative paintings of Canadian artist Allison Katz at Camden Art Centre in north London (from 14 January), alongside poetic multimedia installations by French-Caribbean rising star Julien Creuzet. Goldsmith’s CCA in London devotes its whole space to the evergreen question of monuments and what they are for, with works by 50 artists (from 21 January). Sculptors in glass, at the Henry Moore Institute in Leeds (from 18 February), includes Alexandra Engelfriet, Mona Hatoum and the Guyanese-British artist Hew Locke, who also undertakes the latest Tate Britain Commission in March. Look out, too, for US artist Howardena Pindell’s beautiful abstract paintings at the Fruitmarket in Edinburgh (now showing), and Chinese installation artist Wang Gongxin at White Cube Mason’s Yard in London (from 19 January), with his response to the ubiquitous presence of shadows. LC Alecky Blythe, author of London Road, has opened the ears of theatregoers with her verbatim dramas. Her new play, Our Generation, is based on interviews gathered over a period of five years. It follows the lives of 12 young people growing into adulthood, and is directed by Daniel Evans, artistic director of Chichester Festival theatre, where the production will move after playing at the National Theatre in London from 10 February to 9 April. SC Cue Nick Cave and don your flat cap because Peaky Blinders is back to start 2022 with a Brummie bang. This will be the BBC period epic’s sixth and final series, although a film spin-off is also in the works. Down the M6, three stylish returning dramas portray different strata of London’s contemporary criminal underworld. In February/March, Netflix’s Top Boy continues the battle for drug-dealing supremacy on Hackney’s fictional Summerhouse estate. BBC One’s McMafia finds James Norton reprising his role as the ruthless British son of a Russian mafioso. And Sky Atlantic’s swaggering Gangs of London sees turf wars erupt as rival syndicates fight to fill the power void left by the debut season’s corpse-littered carnage. MH From the producers of The Smart 7 , a hugely successful daily podcast that packages news, both serious and light, into seven stories in seven minutes, come two new audio offerings. First up is The Sweat 7 (10 January), a daily keep-fit show with, you guessed it, seven HIIT exercises to bash through in seven minutes. Hosted by personal trainer Georgie Okell, there’ll be accompanying explanatory animations on Instagram to show how the exercises should be done. More innovative is Blip Blip (17 January), a super-short podcast for a scrolling, visual generation who find seven minutes an eternity. Just 90 seconds long, Blip Blip will pop up on TikTok, Snapchat, YouTube Shorts and WhatsApp three times a day, offering all the showbiz news that gen Z needs to know. An interesting experiment that, if it does well, could herald one way of enticing young people into listening as well as looking. Miranda Sawyer The year-long Voices Unwrapped at London’s Kings Place celebrates everything that’s singable, from Renaissance and baroque masterworks to jazz, gospel and folk, close harmony and performance poetry. The baritone Roderick Williams and Gaelic/Hebridean singer Julie Fowlis are artists-in-focus. The opening event (13 January) features top ensemble Voces8, with composer-conductor Eric Whitacre. Expect to hear singers from Denmark, Estonia, Australia and the African diaspora, plus the Tallis Scholars, Black Voices and the evergreen Swingles. FM The year is kicking off with a rich seam of LGBTQ+ cinema, with a number of films granting new political and historical dimensions to queer relationship stories. Jonas Poher Rasmussen’s Oscar-tipped animated documentary Flee (11 February) weaves a gay love story into its powerful study of an Afghan immigrant in Europe reflecting on his harrowing refugee childhood. Meanwhile, Sebastian Meise’s wonderful, Cannes-awarded drama Great Freedom (4 March) examines the history of Germany’s anti-gay Paragraph 175 law through the long-term bond between a repeatedly incarcerated gay man (the superb Franz Rogowski) and his initially homophobic cellmate. GL Immersive theatre maestros Punchdrunk return to their home town of London after an absence of seven years. In their lofty new quarters at Woolwich Works – three Grade II-listed buildings stretching over 100,000 sq ft – the company will tell the story of the fall of Troy, transposing the tragedy to a future parallel world. Palaces and a “pulsating underworld” are promised. The Burnt City is booking from 22 March to 28 August. SC There will always be blockbuster music memoirs. Often, though, the good stuff is in the margins. In 1969, Vashti Bunyan set out in a horse-drawn wagon from London to Scotland, writing a cult folk album, Just Another Diamond Day, as she went. Her reminiscences, Wayward (out 31 March), capture the times with great poignancy. Former punk Kathy Valentine was in the Go-Gos, the first all-female band to get to No 1 in the US playing their own instruments; therein lies a tale (All I Ever Wanted, out March). However well we feel we know the Wainwright clan, the forthcoming memoir, Stories I Might Regret Telling You (March), by Martha Wainwright looks set to supply new insights into the folk dynasty. KE The hilarious writer Marian Keyes and actor Tara Flynn return to Radio 4 next Sunday with a new problem-solving show. Having asked people to email in their dilemmas, the dynamic duo set out to solve them at their “virtual kitchen table”. A neighbour’s garden ornaments, a daughter’s messy house and a difficulty with a father’s will are all tackled in the first episode. “Most things are survivable,” insists Keyes, while Flynn confesses that, actually, her “three favourite words are ‘I don’t know’”. Both are warm and kind enough to not only be funny but also offer genuinely thoughtful, if left-field, advice. MS Prepare to do a double take as three scene-stealing young actors tackle starkly contrasting roles. Erin Doherty, who won admirers as Princess Anne in The Crown, drops the plummy accent to star in BBC Three’s Chloe, a psychological thriller about social media and identity. Jamie-Lee O’Donnell, AKA wild child Michelle in Derry Girls, embraces her dark side in gritty Channel 4 prison drama Screw. And in Disney+ bio-drama Pam & Tommy, yes, that is Britain’s own Lily James beneath that peroxide wig in the true story of Pamela Anderson’s scandalous sex tape with Tommy Lee, arguably the first ever viral video. MH At the time of writing, the prospect of live music is very much still on for 2022. Some much-missed big beasts are due back in arenas early this year and there are few more major than Stormzy, who has yet to tour his 2019 hit, Heavy Is the Head. Fingers crossed, from 13 March, the rapper will play his rescheduled 2021 dates, bringing some of his Glastonbury-headlining gravitas to arenas countrywide. Fellow national UK hip-hop treasure Dave takes his lauded second album, We’re Alone in This Together, out to audiences starved of togetherness from 15 February. KE From 24 February, Tate Modern’s Surrealism Beyond Borders goes further than so many previous shows by expanding its survey to 45 countries across five decades. A fresh appraisal of the eye-popping, mind-boggling, ID-twisting art that now includes wild and weird objects and paintings from nations as far apart as Syria, Thailand and Romania. Arriving from the Metropolitan Museum in New York, the show has already been hailed as startling, chaotic and glorious. LC For Coventry’s year as city of culture, and the 60th anniversary since the consecration of the city’s cathedral, composer-performer Nitin Sawhney has written Ghosts in the Ruins, a site-specific “war requiem” in response to Benjamin Britten’s War Requiem, premiered at Basil Spence’s new cathedral in the 1962 Coventry festival. Exploring themes of refugees, migrants and asylum, Ghosts will include singers and musicians moving around the building and out into the bombed ruins of the old cathedral (28 and 29 January). Two other Britten masterpieces head the operatic season. At Scottish Opera, Dominic Hill, artistic director of Glasgow’s Citizens theatre, directs Britten’s dazzling take on Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream, conducted by Stuart Stratford (opens Glasgow, 22 February, Edinburgh, 1 March). At London’s Royal Opera House, Deborah Warner directs Peter Grimes, starring Allan Clayton as the anguished fisherman, with a top cast conducted by Mark Elder (opens 17 March). FM There’s an interesting paradox regarding the casting of Bradley Cooper. As a hero, he can be bland – a synthetic shiny smile pasted on to wholesome catalogue-model good looks. But in the role of a villain, that glittering charm takes on a devilish quality. He’s thrilling and dangerous and utterly compelling. The good news for fans of bad Bradley is that he’s back after a career hiatus and, for the next two films at least, Cooper has taken up residence on the dark side. In Guillermo del Toro’s neo-noir Nightmare Alley, he’s a magician with blood on his hands; in Paul Thomas Anderson’s just released Licorice Pizza, he plays a monstrous Hollywood producer. WI Andrew Marr will make his big move from the BBC in early 2022, taking up new slots at LBC and Classic FM. His Radio 4 Start the Week hosting duties appear to have been taken up by the three remaining hosts, Tom Sutcliffe, Amol Rajan and Kirsty Wark, though, if a headliner is needed, Wark would seem the obvious choice. Reportedly, Marr moved because he wanted the freedom to express his climate emergency opinions. At LBC, he will find ex-BBC compatriots Eddie Mair and Shelagh Fogarty; at Classic FM, he’ll be joining Moira Stewart. On Heart, a personnel shift means that another ex-BBC host, Dev Griffin, will be on weekday afternoons, while Yasmin Evans, who left 1Xtra late last year, is taking up a weekend slot on the same station. Clearly, commercial radio’s dynamism and editorial freedom are tempting some BBC long-termers away from the mothership. MS Tolstoy’s novel takes to the stage in a version by Helen Edmundson, scriptwriter of Mary Magdalene, whose plays include adaptations of Small Island and Coram Boy for the National and, for Bristol Old Vic, the musical Swallows and Amazons. Anna Karenina (how will they do the train?) will be directed by Anthony Lau, associate artistic director at Sheffield Theatres, and can be seen at the Crucible, Sheffield, from 5 to 26 February. SC The photography year kicks off with the surreal and extravagantly staged scenarios of the LA-based artist Alex Prager, known for her genre-crossing images of raw contemporary Hollywood shot through with old movie glamour. At London’s Lehmann Maupin (from 21 January), her new works insert present reality into a cinematic past. The annual Deutsche Börse shortlist is on show at London’s Photographer’s Gallery from 25 March, with very strong contenders including Jo Ratcliffe’s celebrated geopolitical landscapes of South Africa and Deana Lawson’s exacting tableaux of America’s black diaspora. Also in March, Milton Keynes Gallery has a retrospective of Ingrid Pollard’s poetic photo-meditations on racial displacement and identity, from 12 March, travelling to the Turner Margate in July. LC Ben Whishaw hasn’t done any homegrown TV since his Emmy-winning 2018 turn in A Very English Scandal. In February/March he makes his BBC comeback in this anarchic, visceral adaptation of Adam Kay’s bestselling memoir about working on an NHS labour ward.

1/2/2022,"A growing body of evidence indicates that the Omicron Covid variant is more likely to infect the throat than the lungs, which scientists believe may explain why it appears to be more infectious but less deadly than other versions of the virus. Six studies – four published since Christmas Eve – have found that Omicron does not damage people’s lungs as much as the Delta and other previous variants of Covid. The studies have yet to be peer-reviewed by other scientists. “The result of all the mutations that make Omicron different from previous variants is that it may have altered its ability to infect different sorts of cells,” said Deenan Pillay, professor of virology at University College London.  “In essence, it looks to be more able to infect the upper respiratory tract – cells in the throat. So it would multiply in cells there more readily than in cells deep in the lung. This is really preliminary but the studies point in the same direction.” If the virus produces more cells in the throat, that makes it more transmissible, which would help to explain the rapid spread of Omicron. A virus that is good at infecting lung tissue, on the other hand, will be potentially more dangerous but less transmissible. Researchers from the University of Liverpool’s Molecular Virology Research Group published a pre-print on Boxing Day that shows Omicron leading to “less severe disease” in mice, according to Prof James Stewart. The paper showed that mice infected with Omicron lose less weight, have lower viral loads and experience less- severe pneumonia. “It’s one piece of the jigsaw,” he said. “The animal model does suggest that the disease is less severe than Delta and the original Wuhan virus. It seems to get cleared faster and the animals recovered more rapidly, and that ties in with clinical data coming through. “The early indications are that it’s good news, but that’s not a signal to drop our guard, because if you’re clinically vulnerable, the consequences are still not great – there are deaths from Omicron. Not everyone can rip their masks off and party.” The Neyts Lab at Leuven University in Belgium found similar results in Syrian hamsters, with a lower viral load in the lungs compared with other variants. Prof Johan Neyts said this may be because the virus was better at infecting humans than hamsters, or that it was more likely to infect the upper respiratory tract, or that it provoked less-severe disease. A further pre-print, submitted to Nature last week by researchers in the US, also found that mice with Omicron lost less weight and had a lower viral load. And researchers at the University of Glasgow’s Centre for Virus Research have found evidence that Omicron has changed the way it enters the body. Omicron was substantially likely to evade the immunity of people who had had two doses of the vaccine, but a booster dose gave a “partial restoration of immunity”. The slew of Christmas research builds on a study from the University of Hong Kong last month showing less Omicron infection in the lungs, and on research led by Prof Ravi Gupta at the University of Cambridge, whose team investigated blood samples from vaccinated patients. They found Omicron able to evade vaccines, but less able to enter lung cells. The latest scientific research comes amid a debate about how best to carry out home-testing. Last week, some scientists suggested that lateral flow tests (LFTs) might be more accurate if people took swabs from the throat as well as the nose. Prof Jennifer Rohn at University College London said that her experience of using LFTs was that she had tested negative using nose swabs but positive when taking a sample from her throat. That seemed to be supported by a study from South Africa showing that saliva samples subjected to PCR tests were better than nasal swabs at detecting Omicron. However, Prof Lawrence Young, virologist at the University of Warwick, said the study was not significant enough for conclusions to be drawn. “This is a small study on acutely symptomatic, non-hospitalised patients. On the one hand it confirms previous studies indicating that salivary testing could be useful as a more easily performed sampling approach. I don’t think this study is significant enough to conclude anything about the behaviour of Omicron.” The UK Health Security Agency said there was no indication that rapid tests differed in their ability to detect the Omicron or Delta variants, although the tests were continuously monitored by researchers. “All lateral flow devices used by NHS Test and Trace have gone through rigorous validation and are proven to be highly effective at detecting Covid-19 in people,” a spokesperson said. “We are currently seeing high numbers of positive lateral flow device tests reported. This means we are detecting tens of thousands of cases that might otherwise have gone undetected.”",News/World news,New studies reinforce belief that Omicron is less likely to damage lungs,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/02/new-studies-reinforce-belief-that-omicron-is-less-likely-to-damage-lungs

That’s how it’s been all series.” Caught Covid? “About the only thing they have caught this series, cobber.” In these dire sporting times, we must take comfort where we can.  I mentioned in my last column that my wife was doing an MA in medieval literature and was always turning up fascinating words. This week is no exception. She drew my attention to a review of Personal Pleasures: Essays on Enjoying Life by Rose Macaulay in the London Review of Books, in which the reviewer pointed up Macaulay’s passion for words and cited the following that particularly delighted her: cantiferous, sedilian, empatining and hagiary.

1/2/2022,"When Hungarian opposition leader Péter Márki-Zay was in Brussels at the end of last year, he visited the street where an MEP from prime minister Viktor Orbán’s ruling party, Fidesz, had fled down a drainpipe to evade a police raid on a “gay orgy” that broke lockdown rules. The MEP, who later resigned, had been an architect of a clause in Hungary’s constitution defining marriage as a heterosexual institution. The drainpipe visit was easy political capital for Márki-Zay, seeking to draw attention to the hypocrisy of the governing party, while stressing his commitment to LGBT rights and conservative credentials. It’s the kind of move that has discombobulated Fidesz, who weren’t expecting to face this kind of challenge in Hungary’s parliamentary elections in spring 2022.  Márki-Zay, a conservative churchgoing father of seven, is the candidate for prime minister of six opposition parties, spanning social democrats to the former far right, who united to take on Orbán. “After 16 years it’s the first time the opposition has a real chance to win,” Róbert László, an election specialist at the Political Capital institute in Budapest, said. Hungarians go to the polls in April or May in a contest that could bring down Orbán, whose 11-year experiment with “illiberal democracy” has resulted in Hungary becoming the first EU member state to be classed as only “partly free” by the NGO Freedom House. “Nobody expected the left and centre parties who dominated the opposition could be led by an outsider coming from the right,” László said. “One of his super-powers is that he can’t be blamed as the puppet of the past leftist parties, or the ex-prime minister Ferenc Gyurcsány,” a wealthy former leader who remains deeply divisive. Fidesz was preparing for a left-liberal candidate, such as the mayor of Budapest, Gergely Karácsony, or the leader of the Democratic Coalition, Klára Dobrev, who is married to Gyurcsány. “Now we can see that the Fidesz propaganda machine is confused,” László said. “[Márki-Zay] is not a liberal intelligentsia, he seems to be much more like a Fidesz member.” Márki-Zay was never a party member, but he did vote Fidesz. He hasn’t since 2010. “I just became more and more upset with their populism, their betrayal of western values … corruption mostly,” he told the Observer. “Orbán has changed, not me.” Speaking to journalists, Márki-Zay sought to distinguish his faith from Orbán’s professions in defence of Hungary’s Christian culture. “I was a Christian way before Orbán. Orbán was still in the Communist youth movement when I attended church every Sunday in communist times.” It’s a typically blunt statement from Márki-Zay, who is equally plain-speaking in English and Hungarian. He polished his English during nearly five years in North America, where he worked for a car-parts company. Márki-Zay, who has two degrees and a PhD in economic history, spent five weeks in Canada working as a door-to-door salesman. His firm later promoted him to a job in the US, where political curiosity took him to 2008 campaign events for presidential contenders Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and John McCain. Known to the Hungarian political world as MZP, Márki-Zay made his political debut in his hometown of Hódmezővásárhely, a Fidesz stronghold in southern Hungary. Two days after he announced his mayoral run in 2018, he was dismissed from his job at an electrical components company. Soon after, five surveillance cameras appeared on his street. Government-friendly media launched vicious attacks on his wife. More recently he has been called an American spy, a CIA agent and a tool of Gyurcsány. This kind of smear campaign is typical, says Zoltán Késv, a former MP who has thrown his support behind Márki-Zay. Késv says he saw Márki-Zay’s potential in 2018: “He is a statesman, he is not the kind of guy who wants to be a politician just for the sake of politics… You can see it in his eyes that he has determination to change the system for the good.” Késv offered his support, despite their political differences. “He’s a conservative, I’m a liberal [libertarian]. He’s very religious, I’m not, but we both believe Hungary isn’t democratic now.” So far, Márki-Zay has managed to unite the six opposition parties while keeping his distance. “The electorate – including myself – have put huge pressure on these opposition parties to unite and defeat Mr Orbán,” hesaid, underlining that he does not belong to any of the six. “So yes… it took them too long to understand this and to put aside disagreements.” However, Daniel Hegedüs of the German Marshall Fund noted Márki-Zay has not yet boosted support for the opposition, with most polls showing a tight race. The situation is worse than opinion polls suggest, he adds, as the redrawing of electoral districts by Fidesz has given the ruling party an advantage. “The united opposition should win at least 3 to 5% more votes to get a majority mandate in the Hungarian national assembly. That’s a huge difference and we don’t see this advantage in the polls yet,” Hegedüs said. “The political race isn’t taking place on an even playing field; it’s heavily tilted to Orbán,” Hegedüs added. The integrity of the 2022 election will be even worse than in 2014, or 2018, which were “free but not fair”, he said. “It’s already a dirty contest and it will be a huge task for the opposition to win.” Meanwhile, Marki-Zay treads a fine line between attracting disillusioned Fidesz voters while retaining urban left-liberals. The Hódmezővásárhely mayor supports some of Orbán’s migration policies. While he has promised to repeal Hungary’s “homophobic” anti-gay law, his tone strikes analysts as reminiscent of Fidesz, by suggesting being gay is a handicap that can be used as leverage in politics. “It’s not necessarily an attractive offer for [some opposition voters] if the joint candidate is similar in some respects to the incumbent,” Hegedüs said. His close associate, Késv, thinks the opposition will stick together. “There’s no other choice. If he can’t hold the six parties together he’s lost, the whole of Hungary’s lost. Each party understands the gravity of the situation.”",News/World news,Outsider from the right backed by Hungary’s left to beat Orbán,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/02/outsider-peter-marki-zay-from-the-right-backed-by-hungarys-left-to-beat-orban
1/2/2022,"Britain’s electricity generation went through an unfortunate phase last year. According to the UK-based website Carbon Brief, it got dirtier for the first time in years as renewable sources failed to provide sufficient power to help the nation’s economy recover from lockdown restrictions. More coal and gas had to be burned to generate electricity. This jump occurred – in part – because 2021 was notable for its low winds. Wind farm output dropped by almost 15% from 2020, despite the fact that more turbines had been installed across the nation. At the same time, nuclear power generation fell by almost 10% because of problems with ageing reactors.  It is a sobering reminder that the road to limit climate change is going to be a long one, though, in this case, the news is particularly unfortunate, given that Britain is still in charge of the negotiations that followed the Cop26 summit in Glasgow last year. Indeed, the nation will remain in this position of leadership until Egypt takes charge at the end of 2022, when its Cop27 summit opens in Sharm el-Sheikh. Until then, the world will be looking to Britain to set a lead and to play a major role in ensuring that the promises made in Glasgow are fulfilled. What other nations will have witnessed so far will not have made a good impression, however. The fact that the UK last year failed to clean up its power generation, one of the easiest ways to start on the business of cutting carbon emission, is bad enough. Sadly, there have been many other setbacks in the UK’s attempts to fight climate change. Another example was provided by the public accounts committee, which last month savaged the government over the failure of its green homes grant scheme in England. The programme underperformed so badly it risks damaging future efforts to deliver net zero, the committee warned. Hailed by Boris Johnson as a key plank in his green industrial revolution, the scheme was intended to help the public make their homes more energy efficient and less reliant on fossil fuel heating. This was to be done by providing grants for installing heat pumps and other equipment. A total of 600,000 homes were targeted but in the end just 47,500 were upgraded, while only a small fraction of the expected jobs were created in the process. As Dame Meg Hillier, chair of the committee, put it: “This scheme was a slam dunk fail.” Power generation and carbon-friendly housing are clearly issues that need to be tackled urgently. But they are not the only problems that lie ahead. As another government body, the Climate Change Committee, made clear last month, the UK desperately needs a strategy to reduce carbon emissions from agriculture and to review how tax policy can help deliver net zero. This last issue is particularly important because the Treasury is now under pressure to reduce VAT on gas in response to the energy crisis – at a time when it should be making it more expensive in order to discourage its use. However, the committee’s key message was even more direct: the UK must now focus on implementation rather than targets. In other words, we need action, not words, when it comes to tackling climate change in 2022 and that action should come not just from Alok Sharma, currently president of Cop26, but from all senior ministers, including Boris Johnson. Certainly, if they do not act firmly over the coming year, and provide international leadership, then the goal to limit global warming to 1.5C will be dead.",Opinion/Opinion,The Observer view on Britain’s climate crisis targets | Observer editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/02/observer-view-britains-climate-crisis-targets

I also love Inkey List’s new cleanser – the hyaluronic continues to work post rinsing off. Genius. Most eye creams are useless, Tata Harper’s, however – reformulated to tackle puffy eyes and dark circles – is worth a shot. To combat winter’s moisture-depleting powers, use Keys Soulcare Body Balm.
