4/28/2022,"When the home secretary, Priti Patel, arrived at the premiere of No Time to Die last September, you could be forgiven for wondering what on earth she was doing there. Was she secretly friends with Daniel Craig? Is she such a 007 obsessive that she has a massive portrait of Timothy Dalton tattooed across her back? Had the producers invited her along simply to gather ideas about the next Bond villain? The answer, it turns out, is far less exciting. This week, a standards committee hearing learned that Patel attended the premiere as a guest of the Jamaican tourist board, who paid for her tickets. And this is interesting, because on the surface there is no clear link between Priti Patel, the Jamaican tourist board and James Bond. To confuse the matter further, the standards committee brought the incident up because Patel registered the gift as a minister and not an MP. Had she done the latter, she would have had to register the gift within 28 days and declare its value. But by declaring it as a minister, the value didn’t have to be declared. You might think that she did this because writing down “The Jamaican tourist board bought me a freebie for no clear reason” doesn’t look that brilliant. However, when the subject came up during the hearing, Cabinet Office minister Michael Ellis suggested that there might be another reason for Patel to declare the gift ministerially. “The nature of the film, one could argue, is connected to executive functions”, he said. In other words, Patel declared the film as a ministerial gift because No Time to Die is a film about spies, and she’s in charge of spies. Now, clearly there is a long and important discussion to be had about how easily our elected officials can be bought by outside influences, but we’ll leave that for another time. Because the key thing here is that Patel can accept gifts to spy films, because she does spies as her job. Now, it’s important to note that Ellis’s suggestion was laughed out of the hearing, with Chris Bryant barking a disbelieving “WHAT?” in response. But, nevertheless, this sets an important precedent. This effectively means that government ministers can accept gifts to see films, so long as the film is tangentially related to their department. This is incredible news. It basically means that the entire hierarchical status of every cabinet position has been completely overturned. Until yesterday, you could be forgiven for thinking that every ambitious politician in government had designs on being the next chancellor of the exchequer. Well, not any more. Who’d want a job where you’re only allowed free tickets for films about economics? Your only chance at a nice night out would be if Oliver Stone decided to make a sequel to Wall Street 2: Money Never Sleeps, and heaven knows we’re all praying that that never happens. Ministry of Health? Boring. You’d only get to watch sad films about people dying, such as Contagion or Million Dollar Baby. Imagine being the health minister, so bummed out from all the heavy films you have to watch that you spend your life praying for a theatrical rerelease of the Carry On films. And imagine how miserable Michael Gove must be. He’s the secretary of state for levelling up. Realistically, that means that he can only go and watch films based on video games, which is clearly a fate worse than death. No, now that the rules have been rewritten like this, it’s clear that there are only two government departments worth a jot any more: defence and transport. The former lets you accept free tickets for any film involving war but, oh boy, the latter would pretty much just get you into anything with a car chase. Grant Shapps must be absolutely beside himself with glee. Until now his job has just been about tedious infrastructure. But now, next time there’s a Fast and Furious movie, he’ll get to sit there in the front row, stuffing popcorn into his face like an overexcited toddler, and all for free. They’d probably even let him do an Instagram with Vin Diesel, too. They’d probably do a fistbump in it. Vin Diesel would probably give him a promotional baseball cap. It would probably be Shapps’s favourite hat.

4/28/2022,"Investigators from the Serious Fraud Office have seized documents and questioned executives at the British offices of companies owned by the industrialist Sanjeev Gupta, in a sign of deepening legal difficulties for GFG Alliance, his metals and energy group. The fraud agency attended several addresses in England, Scotland and Wales on Wednesday as part of the investigations, the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said. Locations attended by investigators included Stocksbridge, Hartlepool and Scunthorpe in northern England and Newport in Wales, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. The SFO did not issue a warning of Wednesday’s operation, relying on powers that allow it to require witnesses to answer questions as well as to produce documents. It is understood that the companies complied with requests for information, and that the investigators did not force entry into any premises. The SFO revealed its investigation in May 2021, shortly after the collapse of GFG’s main financial backer, Greensill Capital, prompted intense scrutiny on the company. The SFO said it was investigating “suspected fraud, fraudulent trading and money laundering in relation to the financing and conduct of the business of companies within the Gupta Family Group Alliance (GFG), including its financing arrangements with Greensill Capital UK”. Gupta’s main UK assets are a series of steel plants under the Liberty Steel banner, including large operations at Rotherham and Stocksbridge in South Yorkshire and smaller facilities in Wales and the Midlands, as well as an aluminium smelter in Scotland. Gupta is listed as a director of 77 UK companies, although many are ultimately controlled by companies in Singapore. The SFO’s action follows a raid by French prosecutors last week, who said they are investigating allegations of “misuse of corporate assets” and “money laundering”. The French government has grounds to believe GFG Alliance has “misappropriated” funds from a steel plant in Romania, according to court documents in a separate case involving another of Gupta’s companies. A person with knowledge of the operations on Wednesday said the SFO’s actions did not constitute a “raid”, arguing that it was a standard part of the process of the investigation. The SFO said: “On Wednesday 27 April, teams of SFO investigators across the UK issued notices under section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1987 at addresses linked with Sanjeev Gupta’s GFG Alliance, also known as the Liberty House Group of companies. “Teams attended trading addresses earlier this morning, issuing section 2 notices to request documents including company balance sheets, annual reports and correspondence related to the SFO’s investigation. “Investigators spoke to executives at multiple addresses, who cooperated with the operation. As the investigation is ongoing, the SFO can provide no further comment.” A spokesperson for GFG declined to comment. Jeff Kabel, an executive hired to turn around the struggling Liberty Steel businesses, sent an internal memo to employees on Wednesday, saying the group would comply with any information requests from the SFO. The memo also advised Liberty Steel employees to reread the group’s “very strict information and document preservation policies”. “We have consistently rejected any wrongdoing on our part and pledged to cooperate fully to ensure they can conclude their investigations as quickly as possible,” Kabel wrote in the memo. “We are encouraged that the investigation is now progressing and is moving closer to a conclusion. Please rest assured that this does not impact the operation of our companies and we must continue to focus on our business plans and operating safely.”",News/Business,Serious Fraud Office seizes documents at Gupta-linked firms,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/27/serious-fraud-office-seizes-documents-gupta-linked-firms
4/28/2022,"The BBC will cut the number of programmes it makes and consider turning more television and radio stations into archive services, according to the corporation’s director general. Tim Davie is preparing to announce deep cuts to BBC output in the coming weeks, with staff nervously wondering whether their programmes or channels will be axed. The corporation estimates it needs to find another £285m in annual savings as a result of government-imposed cuts to its budget. Davie said the era of the BBC trying to do “everything with every service” was no longer viable because it ended up spreading itself “too thin”. Speculation has been rife within the BBC that entire channels could be taken off air to meet financial targets. Davie suggested that while the media loved to talk about the BBC taking channels off air, real savings came from simply reducing the spending on a channel’s content. While traditional television and radio channels may stay on air, Davie suggested viewers and listeners should expect them to feature more reused content, adding: “What I’m not willing to do is to compromise on quality.” He held up the example of BBC Four, which delivers healthy audiences as a traditional television channel despite in effect being an archive service that has given up on commissioning new content. Speaking at the Voice of the Listener and Viewer conference, he said a real-terms cut in the licence fee imposed by the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, had come at a tough time for the BBC. The cost of making programmes is increasing rapidly due to both rising inflation and competition from streaming services. He said his focus was on maximising the value the BBC’s licence fee payers got for their £13 a month. “We’re not trying to be Netflix, we’re going to be highly distinctive and of the highest quality.” Instead the focus would be on switching away from an internal focus on broadcast television stations – where the average viewer is aged over 60 – and towards digital. The corporation desperately needs to attract younger audiences to its iPlayer service and website in the face of competition from the likes of Netflix. Davie said the overall shift to digital viewing could be seen in the viewing figures for the latest episode of Peaky Blinders, with almost half of its 8.7 million viewers watching on iPlayer. As a result the BBC’s challenge was much bigger than choosing which broadcast channels to keep open, said Davie. “How are you going to deliver public service media in a digital age for people who are primarily consuming on-demand?” Responding to criticism from some BBC staff about racial diversity within the organisation, Davie suggested that a “very hot market for BAME talent” meant that the corporation was struggling to retain prominent members of staff. Several leading black executives have left the corporation in recent months for jobs elsewhere, while the BBC is also dealing with allegations of sexual harassment by black women against DJ Tim Westwood while he worked for Radio 1.",News/Media,"BBC to cut number of programmes it makes, says director general",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/27/bbc-cut-number-programmes-tim-davie-director-general
4/28/2022,"There are good remakes, and then there are ones so brilliant the US president sends personal congratulations. The American version of The Office might be the greatest TV remake of all time – and the moment that cemented its success was when Barack Obama got in touch. “Steve Carrell [who plays Michael Scott] came in with this letter,” remembered actor Oscar Nunez in the 2021 book Welcome to Dunder Mifflin: The Ultimate Oral History of The Office. “He was like: ‘You guys might want to read this.’ It said something like: ‘Dear Steve, I just want you to know that at the White House, The Office Thursday is family night.’” But for every The Office US, there is a terrible American version of Skins or Gavin and Stacey (rebranded Us & Them, at least having the decency to distance itself from the original). It is all too common for there to be a big fanfare about a UK show being adapted for another country, only for it to unapologetically bomb – think The Inbetweeners or Call Me Kat, the cringe-inducing remake of Miranda. With so many remakes failing, what is the secret of making a sure-fire success? When it comes to gameshows and reality series, TV formatting – that is, taking a popular show from one region and making a new version in a different country – is fairly easy. In the late 90s, remakes of shows such as Big Brother (Dutch; franchised in 62 countries), Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (UK; 160 countries), Dragons’ Den (Japan; 45 countries) and Strictly Come Dancing (UK; 60 countries) all proved what a quick, easy and cheap way it was to turn TV shows hyper-global. But remakes of fictional programmes have always been a harder nut to crack, with the need for new scriptwriters, sets and actors to make it culturally relevant and harder still – funny in a completely different market. While it takes an extremely bold production team to watch a hugely popular foreign TV show and say: “We can do this better,” there seem to be plenty of them around. We are soon to see a UK version of the French hit Call My Agent! (called – in a direct translation of the original French title, Dix Pour Cent) and in the US, a re-do of the BBC Three mockumentary This Country is airing, called Welcome to Flatch. Clearly, there’s something about shows like these that appeal to programme-makers. “I loved the original series,” says Welcome to Flatch’s writer, Jenny Bicks, who was approached to adapt it by the director Paul Feig. “I love that sort of ubiquitous British comedy for the moments they sit in silence, and the fact you can have these small, tragic moments in comedy. There were a ton of original stories we were able to mine from it that totally worked for American audiences.” Bicks’ version transports the action from a village in the Cotswolds to a fictional town in Ohio; and the cousin duo of Kerry and “Kurtan” Mucklowe have been turned into Kelly and “Shrub” Mallet. The other major changes include the leftfield casting of Stifler from American Pie (Seann William Scott) as the vicar, and the making more of an ensemble cast, allowing Bicks to “round out their world”. It is, says Bicks, possible for the situation to remain more or less the same, despite the cross-cultural divide. “One of the issues people talk about with The Office UK was that American audiences didn’t like the Ricky Gervais character because he seemed mean. That’s a very American thing; Americans want to feel like they’re rooting for the underdog. But our characters of Kelley and Shrub already were underdogs, so we didn’t have to worry that they wouldn’t be likable.” One issue that is always pressing when remaking a fictional show is whether or not to involve the series’ original creators. For the remake of This Country, Daisy May and Charlie Cooper were fully on board. “It was a bit like a blind date meeting them,” Bicks says. “We ended up in the Cotswolds, they gave us a tour and we sat in the basement of a little pub and just laughed.” But that doesn’t necessarily ease the weight of expectation. In fact for Bicks, it was more intense than any of the original series she has written for, such as Sex and the City or The Big C. “You do not want to be the one who fucks up the remake! It’s a lot of pressure – and you have to make it your own. There has to be enough in it that makes it its own animal, so you don’t feel beholden to the original.” The writer of Ten Percent – John Morton of W1A fame – also seemed to feel some mild trepidation at adapting Call My Agent!, possibly due to the fact that the original French creator, Fanny Herrero, had no involvement in the UK version, which will stream on Amazon Prime Video. “I’m thrilled, startled and daunted to be given the chance to recreate such a wonderful show as Call My Agent! for an English language audience,” he said at the time of its announcement. “It’s a big responsibility … If we’re all very ambitious for this project, it’s only because the original is so good.” Which poses the question: why would a writer or producer be so quick to remake a smash-hit show? After all, it was only in 2015, that Dix Pour Cent, about life in a Parisian actors’ agency, became a huge success for French TV, earning a record audience share of more than 5 million viewers – eventually going on to pick up a solid viewership in the UK on Netflix. Isn’t it too soon? Not according to Dr Andrea Esser, professor of media and globalisation at King’s College London, who says demand for prestige shows is so high – the format market is estimated to be worth $2.9bn (£2.2bn) – on average every format is adapted about three times. “Because of the many streaming services, remakes have become hugely competitive, as there’s so much need for content and not enough good talent around. There are research companies dedicated to looking at what’s going on in the world, what’s creating a buzz, writing reports and selling them globally. There’s a huge desire to look abroad, see what’s popular and copy it as quickly as possible.” As we’ve seen, the quality of these do-overs can vary greatly, depending on the trends of the time. The rise of Scandi-noir thrillers of the 2010s such as The Killing and Borgen saw many copycat versions with varying levels of success. Since then, alongside The Office, the other names that come up again and again as bettering the originals include House of Cards, Veep (based on The Thick of It, adapted by the show’s original creator, Armando Iannucci) and Shameless. These were all incredibly popular and critically lauded remakes of UK series that had new life in a new region. Most recently, Euphoria has managed the same heady feat – it’s a genuinely captivating and exciting American remake of the Israeli teen drama of the same name. What seems to link these shows is that the remake shares the core values of the original, but manages to become its own entity. As Esser says: “There’s no formula. You can’t say: ‘You can’t change more than a quarter or more than a half’ or anything like that. A German producer who adapted Ugly Betty for the German market told me if you get a German scriptwriter to adapt something, the cultural sensibilities come in automatically without even thinking about it. He said, what’s really important is to look at the original and try to find what created the appeal of the original show. That’s the one thing you mustn’t lose. After that, everything else falls in place.” But what if it doesn’t? “The biggest pitfall is when people think it’s all about adapting or translating a text,” says Esser. “It’s not – you have to think about the audience. Are you adapting it for a TV channel, and what’s their target audience? BBC Four has a different audience to ITV. Or are you adapting it for Netflix and a global audience? It’s not just as easy to say you’re adapting it for a country – who is it for? If you don’t know that and you don’t get it right, an adaptation is never going to work.” Then there are the fans to contend with. Staunch defenders of the original series will always have an air of superiority, but Esser points out that only a very small number of viewers will watch both versions. “Part of my research highlights that you have people who religiously watch those shows on, say, BBC Four, they’ll always prefer the original. So why would they want to see the adaptation? But then you have people who don’t even know something is an adaptation, as they never go to BBC Four to watch the original shows. These are the people worth adapting the show for.” Plus, she adds, we need to stop thinking about remakes in binary terms. “You can have an adaptation you think is absolutely horrible, but that someone else loves. People have moved away from ‘good’ or ‘bad’ judgments of a TV remake because: what are your criteria? It really is better to think about different audiences – ‘good’ is if you see what makes that show great, keep it and adapt it.” Online, perhaps, the public might not be so evenhanded. However, Bicks is stoic about the response on social media for Welcome to Flatch. “I think, as most people weren’t able to watch This Country in America, it’s good for us, I guess, as it allows people to come in a little cleaner. I just want to do the show proud, and as long as Daisy and Charlie are happy, that means more to me than whether someone has it out for the remake.” Although, we imagine, a letter from the president wouldn’t hurt.

4/28/2022,"More than a fifth of all reptile species are threatened with extinction, which could have a “devastating” impact on the planet, a new study warns. The largest ever analysis of the state of the world’s reptiles, published in Nature, found that 21% of reptile species are facing extinction. From lizards to snakes, such a loss could have disastrous impacts on ecosystems around the world, the study says. “We would lose a combined 15.6bn years of evolutionary history if each of the 1,829 threatened reptiles became extinct,” said Neil Cox, co-leader of the study and manager of the biodiversity assessment unit at the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). “This is evolution that we could never get back. It would be a devastating loss. “If we remove reptiles, it could change ecosystems radically, with unfortunate knock-on effects, such as increases in pest insects,” he added. “Biodiversity, including reptiles, underpins the ecosystem services that provide a healthy environment for people.” Fifty-two experts analysed data from the Global Reptile Assessment, which has received contributions from more than 900 scientists across six continents in the past 17 years. While 1,829 of 10,196 species are known to be threatened, the status of 1,489 could not be determined. Allowing for these data deficient species, the authors estimate that, in total, 21% are threatened. The study was led by NatureServe, the IUCN and Conservation International. Although many reptiles live in arid environments such as deserts and scrubland, most species occur in forests, where they suffer from threats such as logging and conversion of land for agriculture. The study found 30% of forest-dwelling reptiles are at risk of extinction, compared with 14% in arid habitats. The king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah), for example, listed as globally ‘vulnerable’, is declining across much of its range in Asia, largely due to the loss of forest habitat. Hunting is also a major threat to reptiles, especially turtles and crocodiles, half of which are at risk of extinction. Another major contributing factor is the introduction of invasive species. Like birds or freshwater fish, reptiles tend to be less popular than iconic species of land mammals or marine life, but more reptile species are threatened than birds, suggesting more work is needed to protect them, said Mike Hoffmann, head of wildlife recovery at the Zoological Society of London, and one of the scientists involved with the study. “From turtles that breathe through their genitals to chameleons the size of a chickpea and giant tortoises that can live to more than 100, they’re utterly fascinating. Our hope is that this first-ever assessment of the world’s 10,000-plus reptiles helps put them in the spotlight and goes some way to highlighting this diversity, and just how much we have to lose.” As well as controlling rats, mosquitoes and other “pests”, reptiles deliver many other benefits. “They help disperse seeds, especially in island environments,” said Hoffmann. “We’ve also achieved many medical advances from studies of reptiles. Snake venom, for example, has resulted in critical drug discoveries, including for treating hypertension. “The impending loss [of reptile species] could lead to wide-ranging and unforeseen impacts on our environment and our own wellbeing.” In Australia, home to about 10% of the world’s species, reptiles face a growing number of threats. “Most of Australia’s threatened reptiles have declined due to habitat loss and predation by invasive cats and foxes,” said Nicki Mitchell from the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Western Australia, who also contributed to the study. “Climate change is an emerging threat to species confined to small fragments of habitat, as the microclimates they occupy will change and may no longer be optimal for a population to thrive.” The study is not all doom. Scientists noted that conservation efforts to help other animals are likely to be protecting reptile species as collateral. “We found, surprisingly, that if you set out to protect places where threatened birds, mammals and amphibians live together, you’ll simultaneously protect many more threatened reptiles,” said Bruce Young, co-leader of the study, and chief zoologist and senior conservation scientist at NatureServe. Yet reptiles also require direct, global, efforts to protect them, said Cox. The UN Convention on Biological Diversity is scheduled to convene Cop15’s second phase in Kunming, China, later this year, where governments will negotiate new targets to protect biodiversity, including reptiles. “We need solid conservation plans, global policy agreement, and to have countries fully invest in turning around the looming biodiversity crisis if we are to prevent the ongoing extinction catastrophe,” he said.

4/28/2022,"As if the endless muting and freezing, the need for shelves lined with high literature, and the constant fear of a colleague wandering on screen unclothed were not enough to worry about, researchers have found that Zoom stifles creativity. Meeting face to face produced more ideas, and ideas that were more creative, compared with videoconference discussions, according to lab experiments and a field study at a firm with offices around the world. While the benefits of Zoom and other videoconferencing tools made them indispensable in the pandemic, the research suggests that heavy reliance on the technology comes at a cost to creative thinking. “It’s really important to have multiple creative ideas to draw from, and having a larger pot of creative ideas is going to increase your probability of success,” said Dr Melanie Brucks, an assistant professor of marketing at Columbia University in New York. Brucks and her colleague Jonathan Levav at Stanford started their investigation before the pandemic when managers reported having trouble innovating with remote workers. Brucks was sceptical that videoconferencing was a factor, suspecting that difficulties coordinating large, global teams online might be to blame instead. To find out, the researchers recruited more than 600 volunteers who were paired up to tackle a creativity task either together in the same room, or virtually over Zoom. The pairs had five minutes to come up with creative uses for a Frisbee or bubble wrap and a minute to select their best idea. Independent judges ruled that turning a Frisbee into a plate was less creative than using it to knock fruit from a tree, while using bubble wrap to send morse code messages was more creative than using it to protect a baby. Overall, those who worked over Zoom had 20% fewer ideas than those who met face to face. The same effect was apparent in the real world. In a field study, the researchers analysed ideas for new products generated by 1,490 engineers for a multinational company. The engineers, who were in Finland, Hungary, India, Israel and Portugal, were randomly paired up and given an hour or so to brainstorm products either in person or over Webex videoconferencing. They then selected their best idea. Writing in Nature, the researchers report that the engineers produced more ideas, and more innovative ideas, when working face to face. “They are not only generating a larger number of creative ideas, but their best idea is better,” Brucks said. Virtual teams were just as good at selecting the best ideas from a bunch as those that met in person. Things can easily go awry, however. For the field study, the engineers were at their best when brainstorming in the office. But the Polish arm of the company held its idea-generating session in a hotel, leading to “rampant non-compliance”, driven by “a notable preoccupation with the hotel catering’s coffee and cookie station”. Further experiments in the lab revealed a link between greater creativity and how much people looked around the room and noticed unusual props, such as a poster of a skeleton and a bowl of lemons. Bruck suspects that on Zoom calls, people are focused on the screen and the person’s face, a blinkering that constrains creative thought. “Visual focus is a huge component of cognitive focus. When you’re focused on the screen and filtering out the rest of the environment, that spills over into how you approach the task,” said Brucks. “It’s uniquely bad for creativity because it’s inhibiting broader exploration.” The findings are food for thought as companies wrestle with the return to the office. Videoconferencing helps people collaborate across time zones and can slash the need for commuting. Meanwhile, it is unclear whether the impact on creativity holds for larger teams. Brian Uzzi, professor of leadership at Northwestern University in Illinois, said the impact on the real world “could be huge”, prompting a division of labour between face-to-face and virtual meetings that could “permanently reshape the office and work schedules”. But he urged businesses to be cautious, because if virtual meetings are cheaper than in-person ones, they may still be more cost-effective. Asked for tips, Brucks said people could save more creative tasks for in-person meetings, or turn off their camera when coming up with ideas. “I think it unlocks more creative thinking,” she said.",News/Science,"Workers think less creatively in Zoom meetings, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/27/workers-think-less-creatively-in-zoom-meetings-study-finds

4/28/2022,"Hundreds of thousands of Twitter users deactivated their accounts in the days after Elon Musk’s takeover deal, the company says, as prominent users including Katy Perry and Barack Obama lost followers. Since Monday, some of the social network’s biggest progressive voices have seen their public follower counts decline, while some rightwing Twitter users have gained followers, according to data from the analytics site Social Blade. Perry, the pop star who is the site’s third biggest user, lost 7,000 followers in a few days, while Obama, whose 132 million followers makes the former US president’s account the most popular on the site, lost 5,000 on Tuesday alone. Followers of the former first lady, Michelle Obama, are down by nearly 20,000. Taylor Swift’s Twitter account also had one of the biggest drops according to Social Blade’s data, losing 15,000 followers in 48 hours. However, the changes have not been evenly distributed. The Republican senator Ted Cruz added more than 60,000 followers, while the far-right congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene gained more than 100,000 followers in the last week, a tenfold increase in the normal rate. Followers of the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, are up by nearly 10,000, but the Twitter account of the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has lost just over 1,000 followers. The disparity led to speculation that Twitter was taking action in preparation for its purchase by banning scores of “bot” accounts that had previously artificially inflated its userbase. The social network said the changes were due to “organic deactivations”: normal users deleting – or creating – accounts in response to the news of Musk’s pending acquisition. “While we continue to take action on accounts that violate our spam policy which can affect follower counts, these fluctuations appear to largely be a result of an increase in new account creation and deactivation,” Twitter said. The partisan division in which users have gained or lost followers reflects the perception among many on the political right that Musk’s ownership of the social network will lead to a relaxation of moderation rules which, they say, disproportionally censor conservative voices. Musk has fanned those flames by tweeting that he was a “free speech absolutist” and arguing that he was “against censorship that goes far beyond the law”. He said: “If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect.” Nour Kteily, a professor in management and organisations at Northwestern University, Illinois, said: “How ‘free speech’ arguments get mobilised isn’t politically neutral. “Research suggests that free speech arguments are often used in motivated ways. People like free speech when those doing the speaking say things we want to hear, but downplay it when the voices are saying things we find objectionable. “Often, free speech arguments have been used specifically to protect statements targeting disadvantaged and marginalised groups, including the type of speech that’s been banned from platforms like Facebook and Twitter because it falls – according to their content moderators – under the banner of hate speech.” Musk has also highlighted the growth of Truth Social, the social network founded by Donald Trump to provide a haven for those same users. “Truth Social is currently beating Twitter & TikTok on the Apple Store,” Musk pointed out on Wednesday. But despite the apparent wave of account deletions, the initial response to the merger appears positive for Twitter’s users. The social network may lag behind Truth Social on Apple’s App Store, but it is in second place – a substantial increase from its typical position, closer to number 30 in the charts and far behind competitors such as TikTok, Instagram and Facebook.",News/Technology,"Twitter users took flight after news of Elon Musk takeover, says firm",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/27/twitter-users-took-flight-after-news-of-elon-musk-takeover-says-firm
4/28/2022,"The last time Alan Partridge graced the nation’s stages, he was trying his hand as a life coach, in Steve Coogan’s 2008 tour Alan Partridge and Other Less Successful Characters. The idea clearly stuck because, 14 years on, it’s been developed into a full show. Stratagem, Partridge tells us, is “a fun way to share knowledge that, I believe, will change your life.” And so begins a very satisfying two hours for fans of Coogan’s deathless alter ego, as Alan combines motivational PowerPoint with time travel, song-and-dance, and a relaxation exercise turned slanging match with an upstart protege. The whole show, created with Coogan’s Partridge co-writers Neil and Rob Gibbons, is tight, well-worked and has its own satisfying little narrative arc, as the flimsiness of Alan’s life-coach pretensions is revealed. Coogan is far from the first comic to find pathos in the overreach of motivational speakers, but Stratagem doesn’t turn much fire on that soft target. Really, it’s just two hours of tremendous silliness, revelling in Partridge’s foot-in-mouth illness-at-ease, making hay in the chasm between his fussy, small-minded reality and the big-vision sophisticate he longs to be. All this is achieved with the help of a troupe of young backing dancers whose friendship Partridge is needily eager to claim, and cameos from comic and Starstruck actor Emma Sidi as a successful Stratagem graduate and a mouthy audience member whom Alan ill-advisedly invites on stage. None of which, of course, suggests a man whose life advice you’d go anywhere near. But no matter: in act one, Partridge focuses inwards instead, co-opting the magic of theatre (as he keeps telling us) to address first his 11-year-old and then his 103-year-old selves. The latter is to be found in a dystopian 2065 cyber-Norwich, a half-man, half-avatar with an ageing Partridge face and the lower half of a can-can dancer in fishnets. Will we still be laughing at Partridge when he’s a centenarian? You wouldn’t bet against it: the character whom Coogan once considered “an albatross around his neck” is nowadays at the centre of his own thriving multi-platform metaverse. And Coogan clearly takes pleasure in the performance. I don’t just mean the endless adenoidal pettifogging, which reaches its apogee here in an 80s power-ballad routine that Partridge keeps interrupting to discuss the finer points of Lib Dem politics. It’s also the rich comedy of physical awkwardness, as Alan inches uncertainly in and out of someone else’s follow-spot, or disguises himself as soft furnishing. His trendy upstage graphics, which ape the famous iPod silhouette ads, are also hijacked by a precious visual gag that will live luridly long in the memory. Where does all this leave the Stratagem programme, and changing our lives for the better? Barely anywhere. In act two, Partridge gets back to the point, extrapolating some daft anagrams and bullet-pointing the programme’s nonsense principles. One of these – atonement – is illustrated in dialogue with a newer Coogan alter ego, the Irish rebel singer Martin Brennan, whom Partridge slighted on BBC One’s This Time and now seeks to make peace with by means of a penny whistle. The show is, then, an extension rather than an expansion of what Partridge does. Another splash around in the shallows of self-delusion, sexual repression and midlife unease. But no one makes that territory funnier than Partridge, as Coogan proves again in this joyful show.
