1/23/2022,"Different format, different opponents, same old story for England, who started their Twenty20 series against West Indies with very different personnel but in precisely the same style with which they ended the Ashes, soundtracked by an embarrassing clatter of wickets. The tourists lost first the toss and then their composure as they slumped to 49 for seven before Chris Jordan and Adil Rashid inspired something of a recovery but West Indies, powered by a suitably regal half-century from Brandon King, made their total of 103 appear suitably trifling and won by nine wickets with 17 balls remaining.  A quarter of the way through England’s innings 30 balls had been bowled, just five scoring shots played, and four wickets lost. By the end of the powerplay they were 26 for four and Eoin Morgan had faced 11 deliveries for the score of one. When Sam Billings was stumped at the end of the seventh over England had lost 15 wickets for 95 runs in two formats and two continents – with Billings personally contributing two wickets and three runs to the long-distance collapse. West Indies, bowled out for 55 when the teams met in Dubai at the Twenty20 World Cup last October, were never likely to feel any sympathy, their only disappointment being that a flurry of boundaries from Jordan and Rashid took the tourists past that total and carried England from the brink of humiliation to the sunlit uplands of triple figures. The first over of the game ended with Sheldon Cottrell executing his familiar march-and-salute celebration after Jason Roy completely missed a full toss, lost his middle stump and set the tone. England’s opener had hit the previous ball for six, and the next player to score runs was also promptly dismissed, Tom Banton hitting Jason Holder down the ground for four before edging immediately to slip, where Nicholas Pooran took a fine low catch. Moeen Ali hit his first ball straight to backward point and England were 10 for three after two overs. Morgan and James Vince seemed to have brought some semblance of normality to proceedings as the latter hit two fours and a top-edged six off Cottrell. But just as England’s fans, who made up the overwhelming majority of the crowd, might have sensed the sense of crisis dissipating Vince cracked the last ball of the same Cottrell over straight to the fielder at cover, and the collapse continued. There were many reasons for England’s failure: some early swing, some uneven bounce, some disciplined bowling and fine, error-free fielding. Jason Holder returned career-best figures of four for seven and was superb. But totals this low normally involve a little self-destruction and Liam Dawson provided the clearest case, pushing an Akeal Hosein delivery to Kieron Pollard, standing close at cover, and setting off for a single before slipping when inevitably told to turn around. Pollard returned the ball underarm for Shai Hope to complete the run-out. England needed early wickets to have any hope of conjuring an unlikely victory, and got none. In no great hurry, Brandon King and Shai Hope guided West Indies to 50 without loss in the ninth over, precisely four overs quicker than England, who were of course seven down at the time. They had a little luck along the way – Hope deflected a Saqib Mahmood delivery into the ground and just past his stumps and Dawson, making his first T20i appearance for a month shy of four years, threatened both batters in the ninth over, ending with a lovely delivery that beat King but cleared the stumps – but with little scoreboard pressure they relaxed and showed real quality. But King was splendidly composed and hit some outstanding shots – a huge slog sweep off Rashid and a crisp cut off Tymal Mills stood out – as he powered his side home. With the second game of the series coming on Sunday night England have little time to brood on this performance, but as a great man nearly said, memories of their batting out of hell won’t be gone when the morning comes.",Sport/Sport,Brandon King steers West Indies home after England’s batting collapses,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/22/brandon-king-steers-west-indies-home-after-englands-batting-collapses
1/23/2022,"Interpreting services have faced increasing challenges in New South Wales during the Omicron wave, with patients struggling to access the service and long hold times on phone lines increasing the pressure. Health workers and community advocates have described a system strained by the demands of the pandemic, especially when visitations are limited or restricted, leaving many elderly patients in the dark.  Amy*, an interpreter for NSW Health who asked to remain anonymous, said the system has long been under strain and the pandemic has only exacerbated long-term issues. “It’s been grossly underfunded,” she said. “There’s just way too much demand for the amount of staff actually employed. Fifteen people are doing the job of 50 people.” “There’s not enough interpreters hired to fulfil the requirements and demands that come through, not because of a lack of interpreters, but because of budgeting issues.” Amy said her department worked out of demountables attached to a hospital, with little support or appreciation for their work. She said she had had days where she had to attend to 40 phone calls, and the pressure being placed on interpreters was too great. “The patients actually miss out when you have so many calls to attend to; it’s extremely difficult to get a professional on the line at the moment.” “They suffer because of this, especially if it’s an emergency and they don’t have access to language support. It can be catastrophic for them.” Under the current system in NSW, it is the responsibility of healthcare practitioners to book an interpreter for patients, with some local health districts having emergency priority lines. If healthcare workers cannot get an interpreter in time, circumstances mean they are being forced to move on to meet the demands of the pandemic. Sarah*, a healthcare worker who also chose to remain anonymous, said interpreting services have “completely broken down” under the strain of demand and absentees. She said waits of up to an hour on the phone for interpreters were common, disrupting patients and their treatment plans. “Interpretive services (are) based on its availability, and the way it is resourced at the moment, it is almost built to be fully inaccessible. You need to have stamina and just general patience to be able to sit on hold for extended periods just to get through to your interpreter. “We’ve had patients walk into operating theatres who don’t understand where they’re going and why. And no one can speak to them, they just suddenly find themselves being moved. “Sometimes we’d have family members interpreting from the car over the phone, having to deliver news through tears to their parents,” she said. But a NSW Health spokesperson said the Western Sydney local health district, which covers some of the most linguistically diverse areas in NSW, was not under strain at all. “WSLHD Health Care Interpreter Services provide free access to nearly 350 professional interpreters 24 hours a day, seven days a week in over 120 languages including Auslan.” A spokesperson for the Department of Home Affairs, which runs the national translating and interpreting service, said there had been “unprecedented” demand for the service. “The Covid pandemic has increased the number of people accessing interpreter services. Unmet demand across languages is constantly monitored, with new interpreter appointments made to the panel to ensure supply.” But Dr Archana Voola, policy officer at Western Sydney Migrant Resource Centre, said there was some confusion surrounding the service. Voola said families were unsure how and when to access interpreters. “There is confusion around who should be requesting the interpreting/translation service – the doctor or the patient? There is [also] lack of clarity on who should pay for this service once it is employed.” An ongoing issue was the time it took to access interpretive services, affecting diagnosis and instructions. “There might not be Swahili or Farsi interpreters on call to attend to immediate needs. One thing we have seen over time in the Australian health care services is the lack of/limited usage of the available translation services. “The consequences of the lack of access could be misdiagnosis, possibly infecting family members and others within their orbit.” NSW Health said they had also upgraded the system in 2020 and had moved to improve telehealth access, with most interpreter sessions now occurring over the phone or via video conference. But Costa Vasili, chief executive at Ethnolink, a translation company, said research has shown that a majority of people in healthcare settings preferred face-to-face interpreting. “The absence of visual cues limits the interpreters’ understanding of the emotional content. There can be technical issues and limits of bandwidth in certain hospitals and clinics. Staff are not appropriately trained to deal with technical issues that can arise.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Vasili said the service had been “underappreciated” by many, and long-term underfunding had led many interpreters leaving the industry. “Interpreting services are underappreciated by many Australians and are chronically underfunded, leading to systemic issues in the interpreting sector such as low pay and poor working conditions. “This leads to professional interpreters leaving the sector to seek out alternative careers that are less stressful and that offer better remuneration and conditions. “Fair and equitable access to health services in a patient’s preferred language is essential in a multicultural country such as Australia.” *Names have been changed.",News/World news,Patients left without crucial information as Covid puts pressure on NSW interpreting services,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/23/patients-left-without-crucial-information-as-covid-puts-pressure-on-nsw-interpreting-services
