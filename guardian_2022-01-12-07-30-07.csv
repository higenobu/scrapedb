1/12/2022,"The Leicester captain, Ellis Genge, has apologised to his teammates for losing his head at Wasps on Sunday and collecting a yellow card which he believes “potentially cost us the game”. Genge has insisted he made no attempt to eye-gouge the Wasps wing Francois Hougaard and labelled some of the post-game social media reaction as “absolutely ridiculous”.  The England prop was sin-binned shortly before half-time for lashing out at the Springbok international’s face and pulling his hair but subsequently escaped further sanction from the citing officer. “A lot of people have said I tried to gouge him,” said Genge. “That’s absolutely ridiculous. I’d never even dream of doing something like that. That’s disgusting. But, yeah, I lost my head and pushed him in the face a bit. It potentially cost us the game, being down to 14 men for that length of time. I’ll learn from it. “I have apologised to the boys for letting them down, I apologised to [head coach] Steve Borthwick but it is something I can’t promise I won’t do again. It is one of those things, you lose your head in the heat of the moment. I have not got a bad disciplinary record, I have never been red-carded in a professional game and I think I have got four yellows in my Premiership career.” Genge, whose side go to Connacht in the Champions Cup this weekend, has also reiterated how much he loves captaining Leicester. “Imagine being at war and all your troops are ready to die. That’s what it’s like, that’s what our pack’s about.” Equally, he says he has no regrets about opting to return to his native Bristol this summer to be closer to his family. “Without going into too much detail certain circumstances forced my hand,” Genge said. “I needed to be closer to them and see them more often. If we’ve learned something from Covid it’s that you don’t get to spend much time with the people you love, let alone in lockdown. “I’ve been away from home since I was 16 and it’s time for me to go back and support my family, my sister, my dad and my mum in the best way I can. For me that’s by being back in Bristol.” England’s Calcutta Cup clash with Scotland at Murrayfield on 5 February should now go ahead in front of a full crowd following the Scottish government’s decision to relax attendance restrictions next week. The cross-Channel travel issues which have undermined this year’s European rugby competitions, meanwhile, have forced the organisers to classify a clutch of unplayed round-two fixtures as 0-0 draws ahead of this weekend’s penultimate pool round. Bath, Sale, Scarlets, Wasps and Bristol have all now been allocated two points after their pre-Christmas Champions Cup games against French opposition were called off. The ruling will not impress Leinster, whose cancelled round-two game at Montpellier led to a bonus point “win” for their opponents. The organisers say a harsher verdict was imposed because, unlike the aforementioned clubs, the Covid-hit Irish province were unable to field a side. On the flip side Bristol have now accrued seven points without yet taking the field, giving them a decent chance of advancing to the last 16. Northampton’s director of rugby, Chris Boyd, has been charged with improper conduct after suggesting the referee Adam Leal “didn’t have enough nuts” to award a third successive scrum penalty to his side at a key moment in his side’s 30-6 Premiership loss to Saracens this month. Boyd, who is returning home to New Zealand at the end of the season, will have his case heard by an independent disciplinary panel on Thursday. Harlequins’ Alex Dombrandt has committed his future to the club by signed a new long-term contract. The former Quin Charlie Hayter has also been appointed as women’s and sevens performance manager by the Rugby Football Union, with former England captain Emma Mitchell becoming a performance consultant for the women’s game.",Sport/Sport,Ellis Genge apologises to Leicester but calls eye-gouging accusation ‘ridiculous’,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/11/ellis-genge-apologises-to-leicester-but-calls-eye-gouging-accusation-ridiculous
1/12/2022,"Hot on the heels of her harrowing turn as the protagonist of Anne, ITV’s drama about the grieving mother of a Hillsborough victim who spearheaded the campaign to uncover the true causes of the catastrophe, Maxine Peake delivers another barnstorming performance in Rules of the Game (BBC One). This four-parter, by Ruth Fowler, uses the conventions of a murder mystery to examine the evolution (or otherwise) of sexual politics in the workplace. Peake plays Sam, the hardbitten manager of a family-run sportswear business, Fly Dynamics. Friends with the sons of the founder (Owen and Gareth Jenkins, played by Ben Batt and Kieran Bew) all her life, Sam has worked there since she was 16 and is revered and feared. The brothers are on the verge of taking the company public when Sam discovers a body – unidentified for the first episode and beyond – on the foyer floor. It has been propelled there from the second floor balcony.  What emerges, in flashbacks to different points in Sam’s career as the police question her, is a portrait of a workplace that is not nearly as cosy as it appears, full of consciously and unconsciously predatory men, veiled and unveiled hostilities, and women variously cowed, enraged, in denial and sometimes all three. The arrival of the new HR director, Maya (Rakhee Thakrar) – brought in to replace a man called Hugh, who left under a cloud but who, she discovers, is still unaccountably on the payroll – causes the first cracks to appear. “There’s nothing happy or healthy about this place,” one employee, Tess (Callie Cooke, full of flinty despair), tells her. Via Tess, Maya uncovers the story of a 16-year-old employee, Amy (Amy Leeson), who died after a heavy-drinking, coked-up company night out 10 years ago. She begins to sense the silences around her. Several plot strands start to weave together – along with a lot of dark humour that delivers unexpected belly laughs. They make a rich and heavy tapestry, but a convincing one (at least until very late in the series, when a touch of melodrama creeps in). But where Rules of the Game excels is in the bits in between – the parts that give us the backdrop and illustrate the wider environment in which workplaces are merely concentrations of ever-present toxins permeating our lives in a million subtle ways. The precarity of women’s positions, domestic and professional, and the vicious unfairness of female youth and beauty being accepted as currency, is everywhere. Owen’s vampish, high-maintenance wife, Vanessa (Zoe Tapper) – first seen getting Botox while Gareth’s frumpy spouse, Carys (Katherine Pearce), looks on – is deeply discomfited in the second episode by the news that she is perimenopausal. Later, she is put out by Owen’s “banter” about how “grown up” their babysitter, Sam’s teenage daughter Gemma (Megan Parkinson), is looking, while Gemma’s unwilling entry into the world of sexual visibility is a catalyst for later events. Carys finds violent pornography on Gareth’s computer – should she embrace it, ignore it, get over it, or is she allowed to be repulsed? Then there is the mystery surrounding Gemma’s biological father. Sam has never told her who he is, which seems out of character for such a straight-talker and hints at a dark tale. There is also the shady dismissal of Hugh and the agreed importance of hiring a woman to take his place. Most harrowingly, there is the depiction of a coercive relationship that manages to evoke the specificity of the woman’s fear in just a handful of scenes. If I have made it seem like a paint-by-numbers job – sexual harassment, here! Abused woman, there! Dinosaur attitudes, left! Zeitgeisty porn stuff, right! – I apologise. What Fowler has created is a drama that, yes, takes a large subject as its theme and crams in a lot of interrelated issues. But it is never without purpose and never fails to advance the story or portray the reality for the characters – which is also the reality of women everywhere. Not all women, perhaps, but almost all of them. Alongside a propulsive plot, it asks questions about internalised misogyny, gatekeeping, the gradations between self-preservation and complicity, what the rules of the game were and are – and whether women can ever win.",Arts/Television & radio,"Rules of the Game review – Maxine Peake is barnstorming in a rich, meaty murder mystery",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/11/rules-of-the-game-review-maxine-peake-is-barnstorming-in-a-rich-meaty-mystery
1/12/2022,"With a broad smile on his face and a Southampton scarf in his hands, it is probably worth someone telling the watching Dragan Solak, the Serbian billionaire behind the club’s recent takeover, that it is not always like this. Southampton swept past Brentford, a win capped by the substitute Che Adams, after Jan Bednarek, Armando Broja and an unfortunate own goal by Álvaro Fernández helped the hosts into a comfortable lead. The own goal, which pinballed off a post and in via the back of the goalkeeper’s hand, summed up a taxing night for the visitors. In the end a rasping equaliser by Vitaly Janelt was nothing more than a footnote for Brentford, who succumbed to their heaviest defeat of the season.  This marked the first home game of a new era, with Solak, in club colours – a red tie and white shirt – sitting alongside the Southampton chief executive, Martin Semmens, in the directors’ box. Since the takeover by Sport Republic, in which Solak is the main investor, the manager, Ralph Hasenhüttl, has talked up the benefits of the investment group’s plan to put Southampton at the heart of their multi-club empire and alluded to the “big news” in his programme notes. “They are good people who know about football, know about business and will help us in the future,” Hasenhüttl said. Solak, the founder of Serbia’s biggest telecoms and media provider, has a love for golf –he is a keen player and owns courses in Slovenia – but with five minutes gone here he appeared to have the football bug. James Ward-Prowse sent an inswinging corner into the box and Bednarek nipped in front of Ivan Toney at the front post to glance a header beyond Fernández in the Brentford goal. Solak and Semmens, all smiles, rose to their feet in celebration. For Thomas Frank, it will have been a particularly maddening goal to concede given the Brentford head coach had forewarned his team of Ward-Prowse’s prowess from set pieces, and, in the buildup to this game, even made a case that the Southampton captain may be the best right-footed free-kick taker on the planet. This was a corner but it was a delicious, pinpoint ball into the six-yard box and Bednarek did the rest. Southampton were in the driving seat, Brentford a little out of sorts, and a few minutes later Broja did brilliantly to create a wonderful opportunity for the hosts to double their advantage. The striker, on loan from Chelsea, beat Jansson on the edge of the area and crossed from the right but the ball dribbled harmlessly across the six-yard box. Frank cut a frustrated figure on the sidelines, bemoaning a sloppy pass by Kristoffer Ajer that went awry in defence, but his team replied in style. The usually reliable Toney swiped at thin air after Christian Nørgaard flipped a looping ball into the box but Brentford levelled a minute later. Bryan Mbeumo sped down the right, breaking clear of Mohammed Salisu, and stood up a cross towards the back post. Toney missed it but Janelt, lurking a few feet behind the striker, did not, unerringly scissoring across a bouncing ball with his left foot and emphatically smacking the ball into the bottom corner. Janelt almost put Brentford in front two minutes later but Fraser Forster repelled the German midfielder’s powerful drive from outside the box. It was almost as if Ibrahima Diallo, one of three changes from Southampton’s extra-time victory at Swansea on Saturday, had been inspired by Janelt’s strike. When a corner was cleared to the edge of the box, Diallo sent a left-footed shot thudding towards goal that rattled a post and cannoned in off Fernández’s right glove. Frank could only chew on his gum that little bit faster. Brentford could argue Southampton were a touch fortunate and Fernández unlucky but they only had themselves to blame when Broja extended the hosts’ lead. Oriol Romeu exposed a gaping hole in the Brentford back line with a defence-splitting pass and Broja slotted in, via a kind deflection from Fernández’s left boot. Credit to Southampton, who went from the edge of their 18-yard box to bearing down on Fernández within three slick passes. Diallo, Salisu and Romeu interlinked before the latter played Broja through on goal with Pontus Jansson trailing for company. Solak and Henrik Kraft, the co-founder of Sport Republic, rejoiced in the stands. Frank recognised he needed to stem Southampton’s flow, introducing Yoane Wissa and Mathias Jensen from the bench, but his defence unravelled again when the ball was pumped forward by Diallo clearing his lines. Diallo intervened to stem a Brentford attack, walloped the ball forward from deep and Adams, fresh from arriving off the bench, got the ball under his spell with his first touch before dinking past a stranded Fernández with his next. There was still time for arguably the moment of the match, or a contender for that accolade at least. Brentford switched the ball from right to left and just as Wissa looked primed to apply the finishing touch, a hurtling Ward-Prowse charged in to rake the ball to safety. It was almost the perfect night.",Sport/Football,Che Adams seals romp over Brentford to delight Southampton’s new owner,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/11/che-adams-seals-romp-over-brentford-to-delight-southamptons-new-owner
