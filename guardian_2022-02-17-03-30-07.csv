2/17/2022,"Wales secured a comfortable 3-1 victory against the defending champions Scotland in the opening game of the 2022 Pinatar Cup in Spain. Although Pedro Martínez’s side scored first, the return of familiar defensive failings and a standout performance from Jess Fishlock meant Wales progressed to the semi-finals. On Saturday they will play the winners of the Belgium v Slovakia match that takes place on Wednesday night, with Scotland facing the losers. Before then Martínez’s squad must contemplate where their defensive performance went so wrong.  Kayleigh Green and Fishlock caused the Scotland back four considerable distress. They targeted their opponents’ right flank, where the right-back, Sophie Howard, and right-sided central defender, Lisa Robertson, struggled to remain disciplined. A swashbuckling run from the Wales captain, Sophie Ingle, culminating in a pass round the corner to Fishlock, left the pair in disarray. Fishlock had her shot blocked but it was the blueprint the Wales attack needed to begin stretching Scotland’s defence, which Green did moments later with a header that Jenna Fife tipped over. Scotland’s response was to switch tactics and channel their attack down their right. The effectiveness was immediate. Christy Grimshaw’s cross was headed in by Lana Clelland to open the scoring in first-half stoppage time, yet minutes later they conceded when Jenna Clark’s tackle on Green brought a penalty converted by Fishlock. Any Scotland hopes of a more solid display in the second half were snuffed out by repeatedly playing out from the box when opportunities were sparse. This led to possession being lost in dangerous zones, and Fishlock made the most of the next Scotland kerfuffle, scoring from six yards after a backheel by Natasha Harding, before Harding beat Fife at the near post from Green’s cross to make it 3-1. Although Scotland had promising spells, chiefly via Caroline Weir down the left, they were outnumbered in midfield and created problems for themselves, allowing Wales to threaten from almost every attack. After Saturday’s matches, both teams will play a third and final game of the tournament on Tuesday.",Sport/Football,Jess Fishlock inspires Wales to victory over error-prone Scotland,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/16/jess-fishlock-wales-women-victory-scotland-women-pinatar-cup
2/17/2022,"Having courted ignominy and anger with the controversial conclusion to last season’s finale in Abu Dhabi, acting to rebuild trust in the FIA as Formula One’s governing body should have been paramount. Yet so far this week the organisation has instead delivered little more than disbelief and disappointment. Where clarity and decisive action were required, insiders paint a picture more akin to a drunk lurching toward an unknown destination, babbling meaningless entreaties.  Dealing with the fallout from the interventions in Abu Dhabi by race director Michael Masi that ultimately ensured Max Verstappen took the title by overtaking Lewis Hamilton on the final lap has been the single most important task facing the FIA. It is also the biggest test facing the newly appointed FIA president, Mohammed Ben Sulayem. On Monday an update on its two-month investigation presented to the teams and F1 was described as inconclusive and sorely lacking in detail. Ben Sulayem was swiftly wheeled out to make his case. “The integrity of the FIA will always be intact. I am elected to do that, but also to have a fair motorsport: that’s my duty,” he said. “We can only go forward. This is important for the FIA, for the integrity of the FIA and for the sport.” If integrity is the aim, the FIA must publish its report findings in full and publicly. If there were failings so great that structural changes are necessary – which they surely are – then the FIA must stand up and own those failings as an organisation. If the FIA believes the system worked adequately according to the regulations the world body should have the courage of its convictions and show the marking of its own homework. Angry fans deserve at least transparency and honesty, anything else and regaining their trust that the sport is run fairly will be all but impossible. Senior figures within F1, however, believe the report’s findings will not be made public. Instead the FIA will present only the organisational changes expected to be announced later this week: that the structure of race direction will change, the way of officiating will change, there will be the employment of more people and technology to support decisions, and that they will be insulated from pressure being applied to them during a race. Having asked the FIA whether the report would be published and the reason why not if that was the case, it declined to reply. Sharing information it seems has no part to play in this particular pursuit of integrity. It is not a good look for F1 or the FIA and if the faith of fans in the governance of F1 has been severely shaken, the handling of events since has not been widely admired within the sport either. After Monday the reaction from some figures in the paddock was coruscating. The investigation has been ongoing for over two months and presenting the F1 Commission with what little they had was described by senior sources as “crazy”, “mad” and reflective of how the FIA is still floundering to deal with last season’s finale in Abu Dhabi. “They may well say in the next few days: ‘This is what we are going to do, here are our findings’ but I wouldn’t put money on it,” one source said. “It sounds to me like they are all at sea.” Another said: “They have had two months and done nothing to reassure people, media, broadcasters, the teams. To turn up to a meeting like that and be very light on the detail was mad.” For all the protestations that the new structure is just being finalised, this too does not seem guaranteed. Another senior source related how in only the past week several different potential different scenarios were all still emerging from the FIA. “They don’t know what they are doing, people in the same organisation are saying different things, it’s just a mess,” they commented. At the heart of this mess still resides Masi. He was present at Monday’s meeting – extraordinary enough given his actions were expected to be a major topic of discussion – and was described by multiple observers as appearing to be shattered, to have been through the wringer. A far cry from the engaging and personable man that was liked and respected. He too has been let down. If the FIA believes he was culpable it should have done the decent thing and removed him, swiftly. Better still backed him by taking on responsibility for what happened as an organisation. Taking the heat from him in what has become for many personal and acrimonious. To leave him twisting in the wind, “to let the birds pick at him was unforgivable”, noted one observer. Masi may last the week, he may not, with the World Endurance Championship race director Eduardo Freitas touted as a successor. Certainly the sport appears committed to making changes in pursuit of what is a widely held belief among most teams – that rules cannot be changed according to which part of the race it is, that they are followed and are clear. If that is the conclusion and the purpose of the changes, why not make the rationale that led to them open to all? Obfuscation can only intensify the sense of unease at how F1 is run and that the FIA have something to hide. Trust, once lost, is hard to regain and the FIA has the chance now to be both bold and brutally honest. If it does so, the FIA might just draw a line under Abu Dhabi.",Sport/Sport,Integrity of Formula 1 hangs in the balance after FIA fail to publish Abu Dhabi report | Giles Richards,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/16/integrity-of-formula-1-hangs-in-the-balance-after-fia-fail-to-publish-abu-dhabi-report
2/17/2022,"The Dallas Cowboys paid a multimillion dollar settlement to members of their cheerleading squad after allegations that a senior team executive filmed them in the AT&T Stadium locker rooms, according to documents obtained by ESPN. In a report published on Wednesday, ESPN said that the team paid a total of $2.4m in the settlement, which involved four cheerleaders. One of the women alleges that she saw Richard Dalrymple, the Cowboys’ longtime senior vice president for public relations and communications, covertly filming them with his iPhone while they undressed after an event in 2015. Dalrymple used his security keycard to enter the locker room through a back door, but says he was unaware the cheerleaders were present.  In documents obtained by ESPN, Dalrymple is also accused of taking an “upskirt” image of Charlotte Jones Anderson, a senior executive at the team who is also the daughter of Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. The second incident is alleged to have occurred at the 2015 NFL draft. Dalrymple has denied the allegations against him. “People who know me, co-workers, the media and colleagues, know who I am and what I’m about,” Dalrymple said in his statement released on Monday. “I understand the very serious nature of these claims and do not take them lightly. The accusations are, however, false. One was accidental and the other simply did not happen. Everything that was alleged was thoroughly investigated years ago, and I cooperated fully.” The Cowboys said they investigated the allegations but found no wrongdoing, despite the settlement. “The organization took these allegations extremely seriously and moved immediately to thoroughly investigate this matter,” said Jim Wilkinson, a communications consultant for the Cowboys. “The investigation was handled consistent with best legal and HR practices and the investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing.” ESPN says that Dalrymple was issued a formal written warning in October 2015, although the team has not said what the warning was for. Dalrymple continued to work for the Cowboys for another six years, before he retired after 32 years as Jerry Jones’s chief spokesman. His retirement came a few weeks after ESPN started interviewing people for its investigation. The four cheerleaders involved in the settlement either declined to comment to ESPN or did not respond to interview requests. ESPN says that the terms of the settlement included a nondisclosure agreement. However, one former cheerleader not involved in the case said the alleged incident was known about at the time. “It hurt my heart because I know how much it affected the people who were involved,” the former cheerleader said. “It was a very ... shut the book, don’t talk about it, this person is going to stay in his position ... They just made it go away.” The treatment of cheerleaders has come under scrutiny several times in recent years. In 2018, the New York Times reported Washington’s NFL team required its cheerleaders to go topless during photo shoots and act as personal escorts for team sponsors. In 2020, the Washington Post made further allegations involving the team’s owner, Dan Snyder, with a former team employee saying that a video was made of cheerleaders accidentally exposing their breasts during a film shoot in 2008. In 2016, the Guardian reported on the poor conditions some NBA cheerleaders work under.",Sport/Sport,Cowboys paid $2.4m to settle cheerleaders’ locker-room voyeurism claims,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/16/cowboys-paid-24m-to-settle-cheerleaders-locker-room-voyeurism-claims
2/17/2022,"Prince Andrew will not be welcome in any role supporting victims of sex trafficking and shows a sense of entitlement in thinking he has something to offer, according the Labour MP Jess Phillips. Phillips, a former Labour leadership contender who campaigns for women’s rights, said the idea that Prince Andrew could help support victims of trafficking was “ridiculous” after he came to a multimillion-pound civil settlement with Virgina Giuffre, who accused him of sexually assaulting her on three occasions when she was 17.  In a joint statement on the settlement, Prince Andrew had pledged to “demonstrate his regret for his association” with the sex offender financier Jeffrey Epstein, by supporting the “fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims”. But Phillips said this was inappropriate, as even aside from Giuffre’s allegations, given some of his lawyers’s arguments during the case. “His response to the case throughout broke every myth and stereotype, from slut shaming to referring to [Giuffre] wanting a payday,” Phillips said. “The behaviour that has been displayed throughout the last four years does not speak to somebody who could be an ally to victims of sexual violence.” Phillips also said it was not the responsibility of campaigners and charities working to end violence against women “to offer any redemption”. “We’ve got a lot on without rehabilitating princes,” she said. Phillips said the statement had almost certainly had to be agreed with Giuffre’s lawyers but the reality of his words were that they “speak of entitlement”. “What exactly has Prince Andrew got to offer victims of sexual violence? Does he have any skills? I heard, in genuinely good faith, people working with military charities saying he would turn up to things and have something to contribute. But – even without the accusations against him, unproven as they may be – why do they think we need his help like a white knight on a horse? I can’t see him being welcome.” Many in the sector suggested charities would prefer not to have a public association with the prince and questioned whether it was appropriate for him to offer. Jayne Butler, the chief executive of Rape Crisis England & Wales, said offers to support victims and survivors of abuse “do feel cynical when Prince Andrew’s legal team demonstrated so much disrespect for Ms Giuffre and a complete disregard for how their victim-blaming actions would affect other victims and survivors”. “We would suggest that Prince Andrew instead considers looking into supporting prevention work aimed at perpetrators, rather than suggesting he is in any way placed to support victims,” she added. Hera Hussain, the founder and head of Chayn, which supports survivors of gender-based violence, said Prince Andrew could “donate anonymously if he truly cares about these causes but he absolutely, irrevocably, should not, under any circumstances use these donations to absolve himself from his conduct outside of the trial or rebuild his image”. “That would be charity-washing. He should not associate himself with any campaign or charity that works on this very critical and poorly resourced cause,” she added. One member of a leading organisation said they would be “very surprised” if any charity that supports victims – outside of Giuffre’s Speak Out, Act, Reclaim (Soar) – agreed to accept funds or other support directly from the prince. “It’s not a judgment on his guilt, but it’s important for charities to be seen to do the right thing.” Several leading charities that support survivors of sex trafficking declined to comment on Prince Andrew’s pledge. Some pointed to the prince’s daughter, Princess Eugenie of York’s involvement in the sector, suggesting that many charities would be unwilling to speak out for fear of undermining her work or alienating other royal patrons. She founded the Anti-Slavery Collective in 2017, an organisation whose mission is raising awareness, including of people in forced sexual exploitation.",News/UK news,Idea of Prince Andrew supporting trafficking victims ‘ridiculous’ says Jess Phillips,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/16/idea-of-prince-andrew-supporting-trafficking-victims-ridiculous-says-jess-phillips
2/17/2022,"Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has promoted the company’s top policy executive, Nick Clegg, to president of global affairs, Zuckerberg said in a post on Wednesday, reducing his own role in the company’s policy decisions.  Clegg, who previously served as Britain’s deputy prime minister, had joined Facebook as vice‑president for global affairs and communications in 2018. He was instrumental in the establishment of the oversight board – a regulatory group that was formed in 2020 to make decisions independent of Facebook’s corporate leadership. Clegg’s promotion is the latest public shift for the company, which has made a number of substantial changes in recent months as it refocuses its efforts on building out the metaverse – a digital world where users can meet in virtual reality. In a post on his personal Facebook page, Zuckerberg said Clegg’s new role would give him more authority to respond to regulatory issues in the new metaverse world. Clegg will “lead our company on all our policy matters”, Zuckerberg wrote – including forming policies with international governments and “making the case publicly for our products and our work”. He added that the new role would put Clegg “at the level” of himself and Sheryl Sandberg, who is the company’s chief operating officer. “As Nick takes on this new leadership role, it will enable me to focus more of my energy on leading the company as we build new products for the future, and it will support Sheryl as she continues to focus on the success of our business,” Zuckerberg wrote.

2/17/2022,"Grief can feel like drowning. And in Morgan Lloyd Malcolm’s play about a swimmer with the challenge to cross the Channel, it is voluminous. Not a natural athlete, she’s doing it to satisfy the dreams of her much-loved dead sister. Steady and determined, she battles against the endless waves while remembering moments from their shared 90s youth, reciting poetry or making lists to pass the time. “I’m doing this for her,” she pants, going on to order her top 10 90s songs and the top 10 nights she’s had a good time but ended up sad. Though never appearing, the spirit of her sister is inescapable.  As the swimmer, Stacey Ghent gives a marathon performance. Doing her best with an elongated script, she twirls, breaststrokes and breathes to render the difficulty of the task ahead. Flooded with sincerity, as memories from her past bleed into her present, her fight to complete the 21-mile swim becomes all the more draining. But even with such ardent physicality, we get webbed in the weight of Lloyd Malcolm’s tendency towards repetition. Too slowly paced, the reveal of the cause of the swimmer’s sister’s death is neither unexpected nor particularly heartbreaking. The onstage presence of the swimmer’s also dead mother (Shenagh Govan) can feel overdone too; a shame as Govan’s spiteful ghostly presence is initially a feature that shows the swimmer’s body dysmorphia to be, uncomfortably, generational. So, it is Grace Smart’s majestic underwater set we rely on to keep our attention. Tall and shadowy, the swimmer hangs, drooping, inside a netted dark cylinder. Trapped within its separated barriers, her isolation from the rest of existence is enlarged. Supported by wheeling oceanic projections designed by Gillian Tan, we are transported to the depths of the sea. Forever ebbing and flowing, its continuous movement is unending. Directed by Chinonyerem Odimba, the result is a transfixing picture of the mental and physical anguish of grief. But at times, the design is not enough to keep the drama swimming.

2/17/2022,"As 16 February – the day when some briefings had forecast Russia would invade Ukraine – came and passed without incident, pundits in Moscow lined up for their chance to dunk on the western media. “What a sad celebration we have today,” said Olga Skabeeva, the host of the state media talkshow 60 Minutes, while standing on a stage emblazoned with the logos of the Daily Mirror and the Daily Mail. “The day of no invasion of Ukraine, or perhaps as they say in Ukraine, the day when Putin once again hasn’t attacked.”  Western leaders led by Joe Biden have gone public with what they claim are Russian plans to launch an invasion of Ukraine, hoping that exposing the Kremlin’s alleged moves in advance could avert a war. But announcements of a date and, in the case of some tabloids, the exact time when Russia could launch the potential attack set up a big target for Russian officials and media to ridicule. The Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova, who enjoys prodding foreign media, wrote a “request to the mass disinformation outlets of the USA and Britain – Bloomberg, the New York Times, the Sun etc – announce the schedule of our ‘invasions’ for the coming year. I’d like to plan my vacation”. A day earlier, she wrote: “February 15, 2022 will go down in history as the day of the failure of western war propaganda. Humiliated and destroyed without firing a shot.” Little has changed on the ground near Ukraine’s borders, however. After the announcement of a “partial withdrawal” of Russian forces by Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, only two units have officially departed from Crimea for their home bases. Meanwhile, analysts from the Conflict Intelligence Team told the Guardian they had identified a new shipment of TOS-1A rocket artillery being unloaded at Kursk, in southern Russia. US reports have mostly said this week marks the beginning of a window when Russia could launch an operation, rather than predicting the day it would take place. In Russia, coverage of this buildup is less focused on the movement of tanks and Iskander missiles than on the information battle, where the main aggressors are seen as western officials and media reporting breathless predictions of all-out war or false-flag attacks. Leaks from unnamed US officials about invasion routes or analyses of the state of the Ukrainian ground (ice or mud) have been ruthlessly mocked in Russian media. The Russian foreign ministry issued a report last week calling out foreign media, including a Guardian article about arrivals of tanks and artillery near Kursk for its “one-sided presentation” of Russia’s undeclared and largely unexplained military buildup. It isn’t just Russia lining up to attack western media. In Ukraine, where officials have complained about disruptive leaks and over-the-top reporting, the head of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s Servant of the People parliamentary faction said western “hysteria is now costing the country $2-3bn every month”. “I think that when this phase ends in two-three weeks, we should have a retrospective analysis how the main mass media have begun to disseminate information even worse than Skabeeva and [Vladimir] Solovyov [another Russian TV host],” said David Arakhamia, naming outlets such as CNN, Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal. “We should study this because they are elements of hybrid warfare.” The Reuters news agency set up a livestream of Kyiv’s Maidan Square, apparently to broadcast a potential attack. On Wednesday morning the feed showed light traffic on Khreshchatyk, the downtown main street, and the stop-and-go of cars at intersections. Street sounds blended into a calming white noise. More than 2,000 people were tuned in as a drone flew over the square carrying a Ukrainian flag. As her guests laughed on, Skabeeva turned to the feed. “The livestream of Putin’s invasion was run simultaneously on Britain’s Reuters agency and the American CNN but the invasion didn’t take place,” she said.",News/World news,Russians ridicule western media on ‘day of no invasion’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/16/russians-ridicule-western-media-on-day-of-no-invasion
2/17/2022,"The booming crypto assets market could pose a serious threat to financial stability if regulators fail to take action, a global watchdog has said. The Financial Stability Board (FSB), which monitors financial authorities in 24 countries, is concerned that the scale and structural vulnerabilities of crypto markets – as well as increasing interconnectedness with traditional financial systems – have the potential to cause significant disturbance to the global economy.  “Although the extent and nature of use of crypto assets varies somewhat across jurisdictions, financial stability risks could rapidly escalate, underscoring the need for timely and pre-emptive evaluation of possible policy responses,” the Swiss-based body said in a report. “Systemically important banks and other financial institutions are increasingly willing to undertake activities in, and gain exposures to, crypto assets. The prevalence of more complex investment strategies, including through derivatives and other leveraged products that reference crypto assets, also has increased. “If the current trajectory of growth in scale and interconnectedness of crypto assets to these institutions were to continue, this could have implications for global financial stability.” The report estimated that crypto asset market capitalisation grew 3.5 times in 2021 to a value of $2.6tn (£1.9tn). It noted that crypto assets remain a small part of the overall financial system, but likened the risk to the sub-prime mortgage exposure that sparked the financial crisis of 2007-8. “If financial institutions continue to become more involved in crypto asset markets, this could affect their balance sheets and liquidity in unexpected ways,” the FSB continued. “As in the case of the US sub-prime mortgage crisis, a small amount of known exposure does not necessarily mean a small amount of risk, particularly if there exists a lack of transparency and insufficient regulatory coverage.” The report examined the vulnerabilities of three aspects of crypto assets markets, including unbacked currencies such as bitcoin; stablecoins such as tether, which is backed by reserve assets; decentralised finance (DeFi) and crypto asset trading platforms. All exist online only and are not regulated by a centralised body. Of particular concern is the structure of stablecoins, which leaves consumers vulnerable to high credit and operational risks, liquidity mismatch and sudden runs on their reserves. Unbacked currency also carries the risk of high price volatility. Other concerns include the environmental impact of energy-sucking mechanisms used for certain crypto assets, as well as public policy issues, such as its use for money laundering, ransomware and cybercrime. The FSB has no binding regulatory jurisdiction over countries, but rather monitors the financial system and advises policymakers on best practice. Among its members is the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey. Regulators including the Financial Conduct Authority have previously warned over the risks in buying cryptocurrencies, such as ones promoted by celebrity influencers including Kim Kardashian West. The FSB promised to continue to monitor developments and risks in the crypto asset markets, as well as explore the supervisory implications of unbacked assets, in order to help member states address the associated threats to financial stability. “Given the international and diverse nature of the crypto asset markets, authorities globally [need to] prioritise cross-border and cross-sectoral cooperation,” the report concluded. “Efforts to enhance monitoring and to minimise regulatory arbitrage through further cooperation and information sharing are needed to keep pace with crypto asset developments.”",News/Technology,Crypto assets market ‘poses threat to global financial stability’,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/16/crypto-assets-market-global-financial-stability-board-report
2/17/2022,"Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, toured the country to mark a newly declared “National Unity Day”, as cyber-attacks on the Ukrainian defence ministry stretched into a second day. A key Zelenskiy ally also attacked western media for their coverage of the threat of a Russian invasion, saying fear-mongering reporting was as bad as Russian propaganda and was causing damage to the Ukrainian economy.  Ukrainians were asked to fly the national flag and sing the national anthem on Wednesday, to bolster spirits on the day US government briefings had warned a Russian invasion might start. After the early hours of the morning passed without any military action, there was a lacklustre response in the capital to the National Unity Day call-up, with journalists almost outnumbering the sparse crowd gathered on Maidan, the central Kyiv square, to sing. Other events included unfurling a 200 metre-long national flag at the sports stadium, and flashmobs in some cities, but none drew more than a few hundred people. TV stations launched a marathon of ‘patriotic’ programming. US president, Joe Biden, says up to 150,000 Russian troops, well over half its ground forces, are gathered along Ukraine’s borders, and could move into the country now with little notice. The head of Nato warned on Wednesday that he had seen no evidence to support Russian claims it had pulled back troops from the border. Moscow says the troops assembled for routine training missions, and has dismissed claims that it is planning an invasion, though it has promised it could “counterattack” if provoked. On Wednesday, Zelenskiy observed military exercises in the western Rivne Oblast region, and was also due to visit frontlines in the east of the country, where Russia has armed and funded an insurgency since 2014. In Rivne he also warned there was no evidence Russia had started drawing down troops along Ukraine’s borders, despite Moscow’s claim of redeployment. “Honestly, we are reacting to the reality we have, and so far we do not see any withdrawal of troops. We only heard about it. So far, these are just statements,” he said. The Ukrainian leader has regularly called for calm in the face of increasingly frantic western intelligence briefings about the risk of imminent military confrontation. But his latest comments were a reminder of the delicate balance he is trying to strike. He is a relative political novice, who must stave off complacency, avoid looking weak and vulnerable, keep the economy running at a time of terrifying uncertainty, while also ensure his government doesn’t make any missteps that could give Moscow a pretext for intervention. Cyber-attacks on the defence ministry and leading banks, which began on Tuesday, also continued on Wednesday. Moscow denied any role. The already fragile Ukrainian economy has been badly knocked by the crisis, with embassies and many foreign citizens leaving Kyiv, and the government forced to make emergency insurance arrangements to keep international flights landing. David Arakhamia, head of Zelenskiy’s Servant of the People party, claimed western media outlets were doing more damage to Ukraine than Russian state propagandists. “Blatant fakes on CNN, Bloomberg, Wall Street Journal … We need to investigate this, because these are elements of a hybrid war,” he said, estimating that “hysteria” about a possible war is now costing the country $2bn to $3bn a month.

2/17/2022,"Millions of Sky TV and broadband customers in the UK will pay £43 a year more from April while Sky Mobile customers face the reintroduction of £2-a-day roaming charges in the rest of Europe, after the company announced a series of inflation-busting price increases. Sky’s Essential broadband package will increase 10% to £27.50 a month from 1 April, while the Superfast service rises 9% to £30.50 a month.  The company, which has more than 12 million UK customers, said the average TV and broadband customer will pay an additional £3.60 a month from April. However, the price of some services is rising by as much as 14%. The announcement came on the same day official figures showed inflation rose to a 30-year-high of 5.5% in January as prices continued to surge across the board. On Tuesday, the regulator Ofcom said 20% of UK households had struggled to pay their TV, internet and phone bills in the last year, with some having to cancel services or cut back spending on essentials such as food and clothing to make payments. A Sky spokesperson said on Wednesday: “We know price increases are never welcome so we aim to keep prices as low as possible while still delivering the content customers love, the flexibility to choose the right package, and our leading customer service.” The company said the exact increase customers faced would depend on their plan and whether they were in a contract. HD television will increase by £1 to £8 a month while call rates (UK landlines and UK mobiles) will rise by 2p a minute to 22p. Sky Mobile will reintroduce roaming charges of £2 a day for its UK customers who visit the rest of Europe after 3 May. The EU ban on roaming charges between member states no longer applies to people with UK mobile phones because of Brexit. Ernest Doku, a telecoms expert at Uswitch.com, said: “Sky does not base their mid-contract rises on inflation, but any hopes that customers might be spared the pain of increases have been dashed. For many this will be an unwanted burden during a time when households are feeling the pinch from bill hikes across the board. “Broadband customers still in the minimum term of their contract can leave penalty-free if they act within 30 days of receiving their notification.” January’s inflation figures mean Virgin Mobile and O2 customers’ mobile phone bills will increase by 11.7% because they are linked to the retail prices index, which reached 7.8% last month. The increase has been set at 3.9% above RPI. “Should you find yourself in financial difficulty, don’t suffer in silence.

2/17/2022,"If a uniformed flunkey holding aloft a vellum scroll had stood in front of Buckingham Palace and read it out for the benefit of the world’s cameras on Tuesday afternoon, the message from the official proclamation would have boiled down to this: “The royal embarrassment is over. Long live the royal embarrassment.” This week’s out of court settlement of Virginia Giuffre’s sexual assault claims against Prince Andrew is not the tidy closure of a tawdry affair. The sleazy content of the allegations and the prince’s boneheaded response to them have not merely discredited him personally – though they have done that so conclusively that only someone as obstinate as he is could think otherwise. They have also shaken the monarchy itself, and at an extremely delicate time – one that is certainly not over yet and that may continue for at least a decade.  The Andrew affair is significant from several angles. Most importantly, from one perspective it is a paradigm case of a privileged man exploiting a young and powerless woman for sex and trying to get away with it (he has always denied the allegations made against him, and did not admit responsibility in the settlement). Hardly less dramatically but in an entirely different way, it is also the very public fall from grace of the respected monarch’s own son, a man who spent the first 22 years of his life as second in line to the throne after his older brother, only a heartbeat away from being this country’s next head of state. But the affair is also something else. It is a reminder that the institutions of the British state – which very much includes the monarchy itself – may be rather less enduring and secure than they often seem, and a bit more fragile and vulnerable than most of us sometimes think. There is absolutely no doubt that Andrew’s stupidity over the case did serious reputational damage to the monarchy. And no doubt, either, that this is how the Queen came to see it too. But that’s not necessarily the end of the matter. The reputational danger will clearly diminish now the lawyers have struck a deal that prevents Andrew appearing in court. But it does not disappear entirely. There may be other legal proceedings in the United States. The British media are hunting the financial settlement, said to be worth at least £12m. There are already serious questions about who, possibly including the UK taxpayer, will pay for it. Andrew, 62 on Saturday, is meanwhile doomed to live out a life of ageing notoriety, perhaps as a disgraced exile in the Gulf, like the former King Juan Carlos of Spain, but still likely to want to show up on important royal events like weddings, funerals and coronations. How much does all this really impact on the monarchy more generally? The modern monarchy has, after all, lived through difficulties before, from marital breakups, the turbulence of the Diana years and, most recently, the self-exile of the Sussexes. So you can certainly take the view that the British public’s respect for the institution is strong and resilient enough to allow it to see off yet another royal family difficulty – even one as disreputable as Andrew’s. This doesn’t, though, tell the whole story. For one thing, it ignores the institutional mentality. The monarchy has a history of being more nervous about its own position than you might think. George V, a century ago, turned a deaf ear to the pleas for exile from his first cousin, the toppled Tsar Nicholas II, after the 1917 revolution because he feared Britain’s monarchy might follow those of Germany, Austria, Turkey and Russia into the dustbin. The king’s private secretary advised him there could be an uprising against the monarchy if the Tsar was allowed in. George V also feared for the crown’s vulnerability from its own members. “David will let the whole show down, you’ll see,” he said, referring to his son, who ruled briefly and disastrously as Edward VIII in 1936. “London is dividing into Roundheads and Cavaliers; division is certain and only the Socialists can gain,” commented the diarist Chips Channon, readably wrong as always. Nevertheless, Edward’s abdication still casts a traumatic shadow over the monarchy today. The Queen has managed to protect the institution for the past 70 years, although not without challenges, notably the annus horribilis in 1992 (when a succession of family members also “let the whole show down”) and the public outpourings after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997. Throughout these years, support for Britain’s monarchy remained strong, at well above 70%. Today, though, that has slipped. Disreputable royals like Andrew are one cause of that. The latest Ipsos Mori survey on the subject, in November 2021, showed 60% for Britain remaining a monarchy, with 21% favouring a republic and 19% don’t knows. That is still a strong position, but it is a notable decline. It has come, moreover, at a time when the Queen’s own popularity remains undiminished. In a YouGov survey last week, Elizabeth II’s favourability ratings were 84% positive against 11% negative. When the Queen eventually goes, however, things could be very different. That same YouGov survey last week shows how. In these findings, Prince Charles is on 60% positive against 32% negative (Andrew is on 6% against 86%, which tells you why they would be crazy to bring him back into the fold). Prince William, on the other hand, is on 80% against 14%, with Prince Harry 36% against 56%. It is not hard to see what will start to happen after the Queen’s death, and perhaps even before it. Newspapers that have always had it in for Charles will commission polls asking if the public would prefer William to succeed. The public will say yes. The monarchy will find itself sliding into becoming the object of controversy from which Elizabeth has, by and large, insulated it. Its vulnerability will be exposed and tested, not least among younger people. If you want to make that prospect a little spicier, imagine it happening at about the same time that the future unity of the new monarch’s kingdom is itself under challenge. Suppose Northern Ireland is facing a referendum on unification, or Scotland a vote on whether to go independent. Neither is at all unthinkable within the next decade. It will be hard for the monarch, in theory a force for unity, not to be drawn in; hard too for the public and for politics, where an anachronistic taboo on discussion of the monarchy has existed for too long, not to be drawn in too. Hard – but also good. The Andrew affair may have started life as a scandal about one man’s behaviour. It could all too easily become a story about the kind of country we choose to be.
