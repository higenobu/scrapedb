3/12/2022,"An individual wanted for hitting an Asian man with a hammer on a Manhattan subway platform has been charged with hate crimes and ordered held on a $300,000 bail on Friday.

Christian Jeffers, who reportedly identifies as a woman, was arrested on Wednesday in connection with the attack, which occurred on the 7th Avenue and West 14th Street station on the 1/2/3 line in Chelsea on Tuesday night.

Jeffers, 48, and the unidentified victim, 29, reportedly bumped into each other and got into an argument. Jeffers, who became “irate and aggressive,” then pulled out a hammer and struck the victim’s head, police said.

Authorities charged Jeffers with assault, aggravated harassment and menacing, which were all classified as hate crimes. She was also charged with criminal possession of a weapon.
 


According to a criminal complaint, during her arrest she used racial slurs against an officer and threatened them, “By the time I get out of prison, first thing I’m going to do is get a gun and try to kill as many of you as possible.”

Police sources described Jeffers as a “transit offender” with 47 prior arrests. Her rap sheet reportedly dates back to 2007 and includes charges of drug possession, grand larceny, prostitution, public lewdness and theft of service.

Last June, she completed a nearly six-year prison sentence for a second-degree robbery conviction. She is still on supervised release for that case, which is set to expire in September 2024.

It’s unclear what exactly led to her hate crime charges. Speaking to NBC New York on Wednesday, the victim accused Jeffers of intentionally bumping into him after harassing someone else.

“He [sic] turned around, trying to get in my face, get in my face aggressively,” the victim told the outlet. He then recalled Jeffers as saying, “Don't you see me walking here? Don't you have eyes? Open your eyes!”



The victim was taken to Bellevue Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. He is now understood to be in recovery.

The incident adds to the series of violent attacks against Asian Americans in New York City, particularly on subway stations. Since the fatal shoving of Michelle Go, calls for heightened security measures have intensified, prompting Mayor Eric Adams to announce a ”Subway Safety Plan” and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to test platform barriers by 2024.

The fact that Jeffers is a repeat offender — similar to suspects accused in the murders of Go and Christina Yuna Lee — also raises concerns on local criminal justice policies, which may become more lenient with the creation of a new anti-incarceration division under the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office. However, the office pointed out that incarceration “will continue to be an available outcome for the most serious offenses, particularly for those who commit violent crimes.”

A judge reportedly set Jeffers’ bail to $300,000. It’s unclear whether the 48-year-old has hired an attorney.

3/12/2022,"A Georgia teacher has been suspended after an altercation with a student who brought a gun to school in August 2021. The disciplinary action stems from when former Coach Kenneth Miller said he received a video showing guns on Tri-Cities High School grounds, in East Point, according to WSB. On their way to an outdoor pep rally that day, the school officials got notice that students were “planning on doing something,” Miller told Fox News. He said the school’s principal asked him to investigate reports that students had brought guns to campus, the outlet reported. The teacher’s attorney, Allen Lightcap, said that Miller was asking the student where the guns were when she attacked him. Shortly after the altercation, he said Miller found the gun she brought. Video from an officer’s body cam shows that when he went to the student to confront her, the student was agitated and smacked Miller’s hand. He proceeded to push the student against the wall and restrained her until police intervened. “Coach Miller is the reason all of metro Atlanta does not know the date of August 20, 2021,” Lightcap told McClatchy News in a statement. “That’s because he averted another tragic school shooting that day, and no one was hurt. Everyone went home safe. Coach Miller is the reason these guns were found.” After the incident, Fulton County School District originally filed a termination charge against Miller, Lightcap said. The Fulton County school district told McClatchy News in a statement that Miller “failed to meet the professional expectations it has for employees.” “Mr. Miller acted outside of the scope of his authority and responsibilities,” the statement read. “Mr. Miller’s conduct resulted in an escalation of a physical altercation with a student in crisis, which conflicts with district expectations to deescalate in these types of situations.” The teacher’s attorney said his client had “the right to self defense” in this incident. “This is especially true when guns are involved,” Lightcap said in the statement. “Teachers should not be terminated or suspended when it’s clear they were defending themselves.” District officials scheduled a termination hearing in the case. But Lightcap said the hearing was then “abruptly canceled by the District without Coach Miller’s consent.” “Now that the district has changed its charge to a suspension mid-trial, Coach Miller no longer gets to call witnesses so that the truth can come out,” Lightcap said. In a letter from Ethel Lett, the high school’s principal, shared on the school’s website, Lett said that “bringing a gun or weapon onto a school campus” is a “very serious offense,” in “clear violation of our Fulton County Schools’ Student Code of Conduct.” In the letter, the principal announced that the school is exploring steps such as unannounced K-9 dog sweeps and random weapons checks. Miller received the notice of suspension on March 4. On March 9, Lightcap appealed the 20-day suspension, according to legal documents. In the appeal, Lightcap reiterated that Miller “did nothing wrong” and that he “defended himself against a student who attacked him.” “[Officer] Cleveland and [AP] Lawson corroborated Miller’s account that [the student] was the aggressor, was highly agitated, and smacked the phone out of Miller’s hand,” the Personal Investigation Report made on Sept. 13, 2021 said, according to Lightcap. Lightcap wrote in the appeal that the investigation report said all three eye witnesses said they did not witness any misconduct by Miller. But, the attorney added that Fulton Board policies “specifically exclude witness testimony” when it comes to suspensions versus full terminations. “Coach Miller asks that the Fulton County drop the suspension and put him back to work at Tri-Cities,” Lightcap said, “It is never too late to do the right thing.” Teacher caught using racial slur on video is teaching again in North Carolina Teacher suspended after parents said he taught ‘Russian propaganda’ to Virginia class High school teacher shown in video slapping student is now arrested, Indiana cops say Parent assaulted school resource officer, then drove away, North Carolina cops say",U.S./Macon Telegraph,"Teacher suspended after restraining armed student at Georgia high school, lawyer says",https://news.yahoo.com/teacher-suspended-restraining-armed-student-164158446.html
3/12/2022,"By Howard Schneider WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The gusher of money the U.S. government poured into family bank accounts during the coronavirus pandemic, credited with speeding the rebound from the health crisis, may now help limit the economic damage from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and give the Federal Reserve more leeway in raising interest rates. As analysts have begun parsing what sky-high oil prices and new uncertainty might mean, a common theme has emerged: U.S. consumers may get gouged at the gas pump but will likely be able to maintain much of their expected spending on other goods and services due to savings accumulated out of COVID-19 pandemic spending programs that have totaled about $5 trillion. The war in Ukraine is a shock, they note, but one the United States may have unintentionally insured itself against. ""Household savings could help consumers maintain spending volumes in the face of related price increases,"" JPMorgan economist Daniel Silver wrote this week, noting that each 10% increase in oil prices would cost consumers an additional $23 billion each year. Households ""have accumulated about $2.6 trillion of 'excess saving' in recent years relative to the pre-pandemic trend, which all else equal could be enough to cover even a sustained 50% surge in oil and natural gas prices for many years to come,"" Silver wrote. Graphic: Oxford Economics Recovery Index : https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/OXFORDINDEX/jznvnyedlpl/chart.png U.S. consumer price data released on Thursday showed the pace of annual price increases jumped to 7.9% last month from 7.5% in January. The increase was driven by energy and food costs, but still did not reflect the brunt of commodity price increases seen in the two weeks since Russia invaded Ukraine. The month-to-month pace of price increases among some key goods declined, a development Fed officials have been hoping for as they look for signs that overall inflation would begin to moderate. But given the uncertainty flowing from the conflict in Ukraine, the U.S. central bank is likely to keep a wary eye on inflation. Between the higher cost of oil and a consumer price index rising at the fastest pace since the early 1980s, investors now expect the Fed will raise its benchmark overnight interest rate by 1.75 percentage points this year. That would mean a quarter-percentage-point increase at each of its seven remaining policy meetings in 2022. The next meeting is March 15-16. ""The Ukraine/Russia conflict threatens to disrupt the Fed’s tightening plans this year,"" said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. ""But ... The Fed cannot afford to wait and see how financial conditions respond to the geopolitical conflict."" The United States and its Western allies responded to the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine with punishing sanctions on Russia, the world's largest exporter of oil and oil products combined, adding to the updraft in oil prices. The price of U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude briefly hit $130 a barrel, from around $92 before the conflict, and was trading at $111 on Thursday. The average U.S. price for regular unleaded gasoline has hit a record $4.25 a gallon, though that is about $1 a gallon below the inflation-adjusted peak. While that indicates inflation likely has further to climb, it's less clear what it will mean both for the Fed, as it debates how fast to raise interest rates, and for the U.S. economy as it emerges from the pandemic. Some prior oil shocks, such as the one in the 1970s, were associated with more persistent inflation that prompted the U.S. central bank to react with aggressive rate increases. Others, such as the brief spike during the Gulf War in the early 1990s, came alongside Fed rate cuts because underlying inflation was expected to ease. SIGNS OF SUBSTITUTION, NOT PULLBACK The U.S. economy may have some room to give. Growth entering the year was strong, and even if high oil prices slow things, the outcome for the year is still likely to be solid - not the weak growth and rising prices of a true ""stagflation."" ""The U.S. has become less sensitive to energy shocks,"" with a steady decline in the share of income spent on energy, Bank of America economists wrote in a note. ""With Omicron cases fading, the reopening of the service sector has resumed ... Excess savings built up over the last two years can fund this rebound."" Graphic: Energy's share of U.S. consumer spending: https://graphics.reuters.com/UKRAINE-CRISIS/USA-CONSUMPTION/jnvwebrqwvw/chart.png Research on past oil shocks offers a sense of what to expect. Even as gas prices rise, fuel consumption and driving tend to remain steady, partly out of necessity - the daily commute, driving on the job, or family chores - as well as choice. Household budgets then adapt. One 2008 study of periods when gas prices were high found increased bargain shopping at grocery stores and substitution into cheaper brands. One possible bellwether of such a move: Shares of discount retail chain Dollar General Corp have risen about 9% since the Ukraine war began, outpacing the broader market. Nik Modi, a tobacco and household products analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said there was already evidence in late February before the invasion that smokers were trading down to cheaper cigarettes, a trend he expects to continue as gas prices rise. Pump prices had risen nearly 30 cents a gallon from the start of the year to when Russia invaded. They're up another 70 cents since. Yet high frequency restaurant and travel data so far shows little evidence of consumers pulling back. PANDEMIC BEHAVIOR CHANGES Corporate officials who might otherwise expect fallout from higher gas prices said they were hopeful this time will be different. Some studies have found rising gas prices cause families to at least delay larger purchases, but ""the effect of that might be somewhat more muted in this environment than maybe it has historically,"" David Denton, the chief financial officer of home improvement chain Lowe's Cos Inc's, said at the UBS Global Consumer and Retail conference on Wednesday. ""In the past, when gas prices have gone up, demand in this sector has kind of gone down a little bit,"" Denton said, but working from home in particular may have insulated consumers who previously commuted to work. Other pandemic dynamics may also play out. Public transit use remains depressed but could be an acceptable option for former riders as COVID-19 infections decrease. Credit card balances are lower, giving financial space to consumers intent on spending now that social life has resumed more fully. In addition, economists and officials have noted that higher oil prices now have some potential upside in the United States, with the hit to consumers offset by rising employment and investment in domestic energy production. ""Oil prices would need to rise much further from here to seriously threaten the consumer recovery,"" wrote Michael Pearce, a senior U.S. economist for Capital Economics. ""For the broader economy, any hit to consumption should be mostly offset by greater investment in shale production."" Pearce said there may even be some unintended benefits for the Fed. If rising gas prices do curb consumer demand for some goods and services, it could ease inflation by bringing demand closer in line with available supply. ""To the extent this means domestic demand is weaker, we should be seeing less upward pressure on wages and services prices,"" Pearce said.
