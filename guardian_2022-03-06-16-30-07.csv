3/6/2022,"Ukrainians fleeing the scenes of destruction and carnage in Ukraine are already being interviewed by investigators in anticipation of a future war crimes trial of Vladimir Putin, along with his top officials and generals. With well over a million refugees crossing the border, there is an abundance of eyewitness testimony, while the flow of video footage through social media has provided an unprecedented amount of evidence which is being subjected to forensic analysis. However, the sheer quantity of evidence is not necessarily a guarantee of a successful trial, and experienced war crimes investigators warn there is a long war to go before Putin and his regime are in the dock, in person or in absentia. Multiple investigations have been launched at the same time, and it is not clear to what extent they are coordinated, if at all. The prosecutor of the international criminal court (ICC) in The Hague has opened an investigation, after a petition by an unprecedented 39 member states, and will almost certainly receive the most governmental support. For example London’s Metropolitan police’s war crimes team has said it will gather evidence from any UK sources. The UN Human Rights Council has established a commission of inquiry, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe has set up an expert mission. Meanwhile, several governments are helping the Ukrainian judicial system directly in the collection and safeguarding of evidence of atrocities committed on its territory. The first organisation to start work was the Pilecki Institute, a Polish thinktank studying the nature and impact of totalitarian regimes. It has set up the Raphael Lemkin Centre for the Documentation of Russian Crimes in Ukraine, named after the Polish Jewish lawyer who coined the word “genocide” and drafted the Genocide Convention. It has already deployed researchers to start interviews in the hotels and community centres in Poland hosting refugees, and is recruiting more Ukrainian speakers. “The scale of tragedy among civilians will be unbelievable, so every testimony is important, every detail is important,” said Magdalena Gawin, the institute’s director. She added that the centre is also in touch with Ukrainians from inside the country, sending information from the frontlines. Bill Wiley, a Canadian ex-soldier who worked on both the Yugoslavia and Rwanda tribunals, cautions that the testimony from refugees who have crossed the border recently may have limited use in future war crimes trials. Wiley now runs the Commission for International Justice and Accountability (CIJA) which has gathered documentary evidence of war crimes in Syria. The archives CIJA amassed helped lead to a life sentence imposed by a German court in January on a former Syrian colonel, Anwar Raslan, for crimes against humanity. “It’s extremely difficult to build these cases because you don’t know what the attacking force is trying to hit,” Wiley said. “When you’re in a war of movement, it is very, very difficult, because the violence is constantly moving. International humanitarian law makes tremendous allowance - more than people realise - for incidental, or what the media calls collateral damage.” Wiley predicts the worst, most obvious, war crimes are likely to come if Russian forces manage to subdue and occupy Ukrainian cities. “This is where I think we’re gonna see pretty serious criminality,” he said. “That’s where we’re going to see assassinations, disappearances, mass arrests, physical psychological abuse, serious physical, psychological abuse.” In previous war crimes cases, it has often been more straightforward to prove who committed an atrocity than to convict the chain of command that ordered it to be carried out. “The crime base evidence is always the easier part,” said Clint Williamson, a former US ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues. “Linking it back to particular military units, linking it up the chain of command, is always the more challenging part of it.” David Scheffer, an American lawyer who was first US war crimes envoy, predicted that such challenges could be less daunting in the case of Ukraine, that in other conflicts. “Command responsibility is difficult to prosecute, but in this case I would expect it to be easier to prove in a courtroom as this is a superpower military with a definite chain of command and an obviously autocratic leader, Putin, who is leaving lots of footprints,” Scheffer said. Once the evidence is gathered, the question will arise of which court should try the cases. The first two decades of the ICC’s existence have been difficult because the US, Russia and China have refused to join. Under the Trump administration, the US even sanctioned ICC prosecutors in an effort to stop investigations of the conflicts in Afghanistan and the occupied Palestinian territories. In the case of Ukraine however, the US has offered to supply information to the court. Ukraine has given the ICC jurisdiction to investigate on its territory, so the prosecutor, Karim Khan, can begin to build cases for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. However, because Ukraine is not a party to the court (its parliament never ratified its membership), and because a Russian veto will stop it ever being referred by the UN security council, the ICC cannot address the crime of aggression. Philippe Sands, a law professor and director of the Centre on international courts and tribunals at University College London, said that is a “big gap” when it comes to accountability for Ukraine. The crime of aggression, Sands said at a Chatham House discussion last week, “is the only crime which allows those responsible for the totality of the terrible events we are now witnessing to be held to account, to be judged.” With the support of Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, former UK prime minister, Gordon Brown, among legal experts from around the world, Sands is seeking to persuade governments to fill the vacuum by setting up a special international criminal tribunal to try Putin and his regime for the overarching crime of waging an illegal war. “If we’re committed to standing up for what is, in my view, a naked lawless act of aggression, we must leave no stone unturned,” he said.",News/Law,‘Leave no stone unturned’: how investigators gather evidence of war crimes in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/mar/06/leave-no-stone-unturned-how-investigators-gather-evidence-of-war-crimes-in-ukraine
3/6/2022,"Russian oligarchs suspected of having links to Vladimir Putin could have their UK assets seized even before the British authorities have completed formal steps to impose sanctions, under far-reaching plans tabled for debate in parliament on Monday. The move – put forward in an amendment to the economic crime bill by former Tory cabinet minister David Davis and backed by a cross-party group of MPs – would, if passed, amount to the toughest action yet to clamp down on illicit Russian cash in the UK. On Friday the government made a number of moves to toughen the UK sanctions regime after widespread criticism that it has been slower to act than the EU and the US. Undermining Boris Johnson’s claim that the UK has been leading the way on sanctions, ministers agreed that changes will be made to the economic crime bill to allow the UK to impose sanctions on any individual who has already been targeted by the EU or US. They also agreed to reduce human rights protections that have until now shielded oligarchs with interests in the UK from sanctions. The Davis amendment would, however, go much further, effectively setting up a fast-track route to allow the pre-emptive freezing of assets in cases that are merely under “review” but in which all formal legal processes necessary under current law have not been completed. The cross-party group of MPs that supports the move will meet to discuss tactics before Monday’s Commons debate. The amendment says that ministers can act against “a person being considered as a subject for sanctions” in such a way that he or she would be prohibited from “selling any assets” or “moving any of their funds out of the United Kingdom”. This would include land, houses, flats, businesses, yachts or boats and aircraft, potentially opening the way for the assets of oligarchs such as Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich to be seized without delay. The Davis plan already has the support of senior Labour MPs, including Chris Bryant and Kevan Jones, as well as the Liberal Democrats’ Layla Moran and former Tory cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell. Labour party sources believe that, if selected by the Speaker, it is likely to gain wide support across the House. Labour has been working closely with Tory ministers behind the scenes to tighten the sanctions rules in a spirit of cross-party cooperation. Italian police sources said on Saturday that a villa owned by the billionaire businessman Alisher Usmanov on the Mediterranean island of Sardinia and a villa on Lake Como owned by state- TV host Vladimir Solovyov had both been seized. Usmanov, who is a close business associate of Everton football club’s majority shareholder and was involved in several multimillion-pound sponsorship deals with the club, was sanctioned by the UK last week. Yachts belonging to Russia’s richest man, Alexei Mordashov, and to Gennady Timchenko, who has close ties with Putin, were also impounded in northern Italian ports.Russian oligarchs are believed to have bought numerous villas in choice Italian locations over the past 20 years and sources said more assets were expected to be seized in coming days as western states implement massive sanctions to try to force Russia to withdraw from Ukraine.Italian banks were instructed by the Bank of Italy’s financial intelligence division on Friday to urgently let it know of all measures taken to freeze the assets of people and entities placed on the EU list. About £1.1bn is known to be invested by Russians in London property, but whereas only 15 oligarchs have had sanctions imposed on them in the UK, the number is around double that in the EU. The economic crime bill would establish a public register of “beneficial owners” of non-UK entities that own or buy land in the UK, operated by Companies House, giving the authorities the initial information they needed en route to imposing sanctions. Any such person wishing to own UK property or land would need to identify their beneficial owners and register them. They would have six months from the time of the act coming into force to either sell off their land or register. Labour will push on Monday for this period to be reduced to 28 days, arguing that a period of six months gives oligarchs too long a window to sell and move their assets. The Davis amendment is among dozens put down by MPs of all parties in order to tighten the sanctions regime.Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge has tabled an amendment saying that overseas owners should have to register football clubs, jets or yachts as well as property and land on the new list. Fellow Labour MP Bryant claimed last week that Abramovich is “terrified of being sanctioned” and is rushing to sell his UK properties in order to avoid potential financial sanctions.",News/World news,MPs seeking ‘fast-track’ freeze on oligarchs’ assets before formal sanctions,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/06/mps-seeking-fast-track-freeze-on-oligarchs-assets-before-formal-sanctions
3/6/2022,"In modern times – at least since the mid-19th century – the Old City of Jerusalem has been conventionally described by foreigners as consisting of four distinct quarters: Muslim, Christian, Jewish and Armenian. Matthew Teller, in his highly perceptive and readable book, tells a very different story. Teller, a freelance journalist and documentary-maker, combines millennia of Jerusalem’s history with insightful interviews with its residents, weaponising that unusual approach to present a subtle portrait of the current reality at the heart of the world’s most intractable and divisive conflict. The Old City is still enclosed by 16th-century walls built by the Ottomans and only started to expand beyond them in the 1860s when Britain, then the rising global superpower, began to take an interest, reinforced by its Protestant Christian identity. It occupied Palestine towards the end of the first world war, issuing the Balfour Declaration in November 1917, a landmark achievement for the nascent Zionist movement. Much has changed since then, especially for the 32,000 Palestinians (about 90% of the Old City’s population) who now reside in what Teller defines as nine quarters. These include different denominations of Christians, African and Sufi Muslims, Gypsies (known as Rom) and Israeli Jews (largely Orthodox) who live in far better conditions with the backing of their controlling state. Israel claims Jerusalem as its capital, though that is not recognised by most countries (except the US), which maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv. In English, a quarter is a place where “others” live. In Arabic, though, it has a very different conceptual framework. Hara can mean both a street and a small neighbourhood. In 1495, one historian identified 18 harat (plural) in Jerusalem, all in what is now known as the Old City. Another counted 39 in an earlier period. The main religious sites are the Haram al-Sharif, or the al-Aqsa mosque compound, the site of the prophet Muhammad’s ascent to heaven from the Dome of the Rock and alongside the Haram, the Western Wall by the Temple Mount, which is of huge significance to Jews. Important churches include the Holy Sepulchre, where Jesus was crucified and where rivalry between Ethiopian Orthodox monks and Egyptian Copts is rife. But this story is not just about holy places, shrines, convents, synagogues and devout pilgrims and missionaries exploring the 14 stations of the cross. It is also about narrow alleyways between markets, lined with restaurants, souvenir shops, tourists and guides and, above all, the fascinating story of ordinary life in the past and present guided by trilingual street signs. “A thorny path runs alongside its joys,” as a friend told the author. Each of the Old City’s eight gates provides insightful tales. The Damascus Gate – Bab al-Amoud (gate of the column in Arabic, referring to a Roman column that hasn’t existed for more than a thousand years) is the main transit point between the Old City and (still largely) Palestinian East Jerusalem. In Hebrew, it is called Sha’ar Shekhem (“Nablus gate”, Nablus being the first major city north of Jerusalem). The Jaffa Gate is known in Arabic as Bab al-Khalil – the “Hebron Gate” (Hebron is the largest West Bank town south of Jerusalem). It is called Sha’ar Yafo in Hebrew, too, Yafo being the Hebrew name of Jaffa. The author, who has strong personal opinions, finds it “the most disquieting corner of a disquieting city”, which symbolises the aspirations of outsiders who seek to dominate the lives of Jerusalem. Take the role of Charles Ashbee, the adviser to the British governor of the city in 1917, Ronald Storrs. Ashbee was the main founder of the Arts and Crafts movement, was totally against modernisation and adored the medieval walls. He ordered the demolition of shops and cafes surrounding them, created walkways along the ramparts and green lawns on the side. He also loathed the clock tower that the Ottoman sultan Abdulhamid II, built above the Jaffa Gate in 1908. “British rule was set on creating, then entrenching, a division between the walled ‘Old City’ – the idealised Jerusalem of imagination – and the altogether less desirable ‘New City’ outside the walls,” writes Teller in a key passage. “Today, Israeli policy adapts the same idea, using new walls – this time of concrete – alongside tools such as economic and demographic manipulation to further divide Jerusalem and cut the city off from its Palestinian hinterland.” Teller repeatedly defines himself as a “non-believer”, which is why he is able to write about Jerusalem in such a robustly secular and iconoclastic way. (He even uses inverted commas around the conventional term Holy Land.) But he still manages to exude affection for it and compassion for the people who live there. About 2,000 Jews were expelled during the 1948 war by Jordanian troops who conquered the Old City and the rest of East Jerusalem. For 19 years, minefields and barbed wire separated both sides of town. Some Jews were able to go back after what Israelis call the six-day war. By contrast, 28,000 Palestinians were also expelled from western suburbs and nearby villages, including Deir Yassin, site of the notorious massacre in April 1948. None have been able to return home. The Jewish Quarter now feels very different from the other areas of the Old City. It is mostly modern, upmarket and gentrified, built since Israel’s stunning victory in June 1967, when the slummy Moroccan area next to the Western Wall was speedily demolished. Arabic is not heard there and armed Israeli police checkpoints are absent. But the police have for decades recruited Palestinian informers to keep an eye on their own neighbours. East Jerusalem as a whole, formally annexed by Israel in 1980, has attracted attention in recent times because of the planned eviction of Palestinian residents from the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood by Israeli settlers. That provided the spark that ignited last May’s 11-day war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, which only reinforced the bleakness of the continuing “one-state reality” with unequal rights for Israelis and Palestinians. It’s good and timely to focus again on the Old City and its complicated past and turbulent present. “This city,” as Teller writes, using a brilliant simile, “wears its history like a teenager wears a school uniform – joyless.” Nine Quarters of Jerusalem: A New Biography of the Old City by Matthew Teller is published by Profile Books (£16.99).

3/6/2022,"This book should have been titled Everything You Ever Wanted to Know about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez But Were Afraid to Ask. Whether you love her or loathe her, the former Sandy Ocasio has an irresistible story, told here in a brisk four-chapter narrative followed by brief sections on everything from a make-up video she made for Vogue to her evisceration of Mark Zuckerberg at a congressional hearing. The woman now known everywhere as AOC was born in the Bronx and lived there until her Puerto Rican-American parents moved her to Westchester to make sure she attended a decent public high school. A science nerd whose first ambition was to be a doctor, she dropped her pre-med major at Boston University and majored in economics and international relations. Like Pete Buttigieg, she did a brief stint as an intern for Ted Kennedy, but she didn’t enjoy it as much as he did. She spent her junior year in the African nation of Niger, where she had an unusual reaction to poverty. She decided Niger’s struggling citizens had “a level of enjoyment” that “just does not exist in American life”. In college she met Riley Roberts, a tall, smart, red-haired finance and sociology major who went from coffee house debating partner to boyfriend. Today he is a web developer and still her boyfriend, someone who tiptoes “through the public sphere, leaving little evidence of his presence”, according to the four-page section of Take Up Space which is devoted to him. AOC’s father, an architect, died of cancer while she was in college, leaving her mother struggling to hold on to their house. So after college her daughter came to New York and became a restaurant worker to make money and to be close to her mother. The striking-looking bartender who came out of nowhere to be elected to Congress three weeks after her 29th birthday was launched into politics by her brother Gabriel, who heard a group called Brand New Congress formed by Bernie Sanders supporters was looking for people to nominate anyone they thought should run in 2018. Pulled over to the side of the road in a rainstorm, Gabriel phoned his sister and asked if she wanted to run. Her reaction: “Eff it. Sure. Whatever.” So her brother, still sitting in his car, filled out the web form and hit “send”. Brand New Congress morphed into “Justice Democrats”, who had 10,000 nominations for candidates. Gradually, AOC became their favorite, not only because she was extremely smart but also because she was “really pretty”. That, Corbin Trent explained, is “like 20%, 50% of being on TV”. Trent became her communications director. The rigid leftwing ideology of Lisa Miller, who wrote the longest section of this book, sometimes leads her into statements directly contradicted by AOC’s success. Miller writes that the “facts of Ocasio-Cortez’s life” made her both an “impossible candidate” and “the kind of American whose hopes for any social mobility had been crushed by a rigged system perpetuated by officials elected to represent the people’s interests”. In real life, the facts of AOC’s Cinderella story made her the perfect candidate to take on Joseph Crowley, the Democratic boss who held the House seat she was going after – and AOC turned out to be the least “crushed” person in America. As she learned at a political boot camp organized by Justice Democrats, nothing was more important than “telling an authentic believable personal story”– and no one was better at doing that than she was. As a Black Lives Matter activist, Kim Balderas, noticed in 2017, AOC spoke like an organizer. That made Balderas realize “she’s not coming to play. She is coming to fight”. Outspent in the primary by Crowley, $4.5m to $550,000, AOC still managed to crush him with 57% of the vote. One secret to her success was Twitter. The month she won the primary she had 30,000 followers. Four weeks later she had 500,000. The number now hovers closer to 13 million. A 10-page section of the book describes her “art of the dunk”, including diagrams of her most successful exchanges, including one in which Laura Ingraham accused her of wearing $14,000 worth of clothes for a Vanity Fair photo shoot. “I don’t know if you’ve been in a photo shoot Laura,” AOC replied, “but you don’t keep the clothes.” She added: “The whole ‘she wore clothes in a magazine’, let’s pretend they’re hers’ gimmick is the classic Republican strategy of ‘let’s willfully act stupid, and if the public doesn’t take our performance stupidity seriously then we’ll claim bias’.” But her very best exchange is also the strongest evidence that the now 31-year old two term congresswoman has grown into a national treasure – and an interlocutor who almost always manages to have the last word. In “The Zuckerberg Grilling” section of the book, she interrogates the Facebook founder at a congressional hearing shortly after his company announced it would not fact-check political ads. She asked: “Would I be able to run advertisements on Facebook targeting Republicans in primaries saying they voted for the Green New Deal? … I’m just trying to understand the bounds here, what’s fair game.” “I don’t know the answer to that off the top of my head,” said the flustered Zuckerberg. “I think probably ...” AOC: “So you don’t know if I’ll be able to do that.” Zuckerberg: “I think probably.” AOC followed up by asking how Facebook had chosen the Daily Caller, “a publication well documented with ties to white supremacists”, as an “official fact-checker for Facebook”. Zuckerberg said the Daily Caller had been chosen by “an independent organization called the Independent Fact-Checking Network”. AOC: “So you would say that white-supremacist-tied publications meet a rigorous standard for fact-checking? Thank you.” Take Up Space: the Unprecedented AOC is published in the US by Avid Reader Press/Simon & Schuster",Arts/Books,Take Up Space review: the irresistible rise of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/06/take-up-space-review-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-aoc-book
3/6/2022,"Oti Mabuse has spoken of how her mother created her own dance school in the family’s home town in South Africa to provide her daughters with opportunities that she did not have growing up. Mabuse, 31, has won the South African Latin American championships eight times and is one of the most successful professionals to have appeared on BBC’s Strictly Come Dancing, which she has won twice. Mabuse’s older sister, Phemelo, also pursued dance as a child, while her eldest sibling, Motsi, went on to be a professional ballroom dancer and sits on the judging panel of Strictly. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, Mabuse said her mother, Dudu, loved ballroom dancing, but as she grew up under apartheid in South Africa did not have the chance to learn. She said: “The opportunities weren’t there for them; there were no dance schools, there were no dance teachers. It was very segregated as well. And she always loved it, she always wanted to do it, she always wanted to wear those big ballroom dresses and have her hair done. “But also in those years, black people weren’t allowed to even be in the same room or on the same dancefloor as white people.” Mabuse said her mother was motivated to start her own dance school as “no one was teaching black kids how to dance” where they lived at the time. Growing up in this environment, Mabuse said dance was “all she saw” but that her mother maintained a very strict regime for her children which included only school, sport and dance. Mabuse added: “She just didn’t want us to grow up and feel like we didn’t have opportunities, and she wanted to make sure that we were always busy so that we wouldn’t have been on the streets, we weren’t getting up to any mischief. “She always fought for us and she taught us to fight for ourselves and not take no for an answer and be as ambitious and dedicated and competitive as we are.” Mabuse said she gained her competitive streak from her father, who worked as a lawyer assisting those who could not afford to pay for representation when wrongfully arrested. She said that this determination helped her win Strictly Come Dancing twice, in 2019 with the actor Kelvin Fletcher and in 2020 with the comedian Bill Bailey. Last month, Mabuse announced that she was departing Strictly after appearing on the show as a professional for seven years.

3/6/2022,"When Joe Biden made the struggle between democracy and autocracy the lodestar of his presidency, it was widely assumed that his principal antagonists would be China’s Xi Jinping abroad and America’s own Donald Trump at home. But it is Vladimir Putin of Russia who has made the contest more immediate and literal than anyone expected, launching a bloody invasion of Ukraine that threatens to bring down a new iron curtain in Europe. Biden, who made no mention of Putin, Russia or nuclear weapons in his inaugural address, is discovering a truism of US history: American presidencies are often defined by crises that no one saw coming. “I am old enough to remember [British prime minister] Harold Macmillan who, when asked what was driving his actions, replied, ‘Events, dear boy, events’,” said Bill Galston, a former policy adviser to President Bill Clinton. “I’m sure when Joe Biden was running for president, the last thing on his mind was a revival of the cold war. “He was already focused, and has been for years, on the conflict between democracy and autocracy but that was more of a frame for looking at the world than it was an operational manual. Now here we are. It’s truly extraordinary when you think about it.” Just as Biden’s empathy was seen as ideal for meeting the moment of the coronavirus pandemic, and just as his record of bipartisanship was thought to be well suited to healing America’s divisions, so his storied foreign policy experience and faith in multinational institutions appear to bode well for this test. That is certainly the view of Democrats who believe that Biden, who at 79 lived every moment of the cold war, including its gnawing dread of nuclear annihilation, has risen to the occasion. Last month he authorised $350m of military equipment – the biggest such package in US history – to bolster Ukraine’s courageous fighters who have exceeded all expectations. He led an unprecedented declassification of intelligence about Russia’s intentions to invade and to justify its actions, weakening Moscow’s arguments on the world stage. Biden and his team held countless meetings and phone calls to rally western allies, helping imbue Nato with a sense of unity and purpose that many feared it had lost forever. The resulting sanctions imposed have gone further than many expected in scope and scale and could collapse the Russian economy. Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, commented: “The Ukraine crisis has been the Biden administration’s finest hour. The president and his senior officials have been skillful and tireless in trying to coordinate a united response. The results speak for themselves. The sanctions are extraordinary and even more extraordinary has been the turnaround in European thinking and policy. It’s been breathtakingly fast.” But all this represents a hollow victory, critics say, because the harsh reality is that it did not prevent Putin making his move and inflicting horrific civilian casualties in Ukraine. Biden’s radical transparency included stating early and forcefully that no American troops would set foot in the country. John Bolton, a former national security adviser to Trump, said: “It depends on what your definition of success is. The supporters of Biden say Nato’s united and I think that’s true. And Ukraine is in ashes.” He added: “I don’t think collectively the west did what was necessary here and you can measure failure pretty clearly by the Russian army being in Ukraine. I don’t think we view our current position with equanimity.” The US and Nato have rejected appeals to impose a “no-fly” zone, which might require their forces to shoot down Russian aircraft and draw them directly into a war with a nuclear power led by a dangerously unstable tyrant. This earned a rebuke from Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s president, who said on Friday that Nato “gave the green light for further bombing of Ukrainian cities and villages”. Bolton, a former interim US ambassador to the UN, believes the opportunity for such a measure has been lost. “It’s not practical because we’ve waited this long and Biden and the UK and all of Nato have basically said, we’re not going to do it.” “But everybody in Europe better get used to the fact that we’re going to watch something on the continent that we said in 1945 we’d never let happen again. And it’s going to happen, I think, right in front of us.” The war in Ukraine has given an unexpected boost to Biden’s efforts to revive bipartisanship in Washington. Republicans have been broadly supportive and gave him several standing ovations when he discussed the conflict at the start of his State of the Union address last week. But the truce only goes so far. Some Republicans argue that Biden’s botched withdrawal from Afghanistan betrayed weakness and encouraged Putin and that the invasion would not have happened if Trump was still in the White House. They say the sanctions have been too slow and incremental. And they are joining Democrats in pushing the president to ban Russian oil imports while calling for American energy independence. Biden, however, has been reluctant to call out his Republican critics so far, and his approval rating has begun to climb since the crisis began, according to a PBSNewsHour/NPR/Marist poll. About half of the American public – 52% – said this week they support how the president is handling the situation in Ukraine. This was up from two weeks ago when about a third said they approved. Leon Panetta, a former defense secretary and CIA director, said: “Forty years of foreign affairs experience by President Biden is paying off. We weren’t sure with Afghanistan but it clearly is paying off now in the way he’s been able to establish a unified approach between the US and our Nato allies. The bottom line is that we could not have made Putin pay a price were it not for that unity.” There appears to have been determination not repeat the blunders of Afghanistan, when allies felt blindsided as the Taliban rapidly took over and the US and western governments fled. Panetta, co-founder of the Panetta Institute for Public Policy, added: “Presidents are always tested by crisis but presidents have to learn from their mistakes and I think President Biden knows what he did wrong and knows now what he has to do to provide that leadership. “In some ways I thought Afghanistan was kind of his Bay of Pigs but John Kennedy was able to come back and really establish a strong foreign policy and I’m hoping that Joe Biden can do the same. He will be tested but, having put together this unified approach, I feel confident that he will now see it see it through. You have to remain strong. You can’t blink when it comes to dealing with Putin.”",News/US news,Biden rises to the moment as Ukraine makes battle against autocracy real,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/06/joe-biden-ukraine-autocracy-democracy-approval
3/6/2022,"In his long life as a photographer, Saul Leiter was “discovered” several times, but only lastingly in 2006, when he was 82, and a small book of his photographs, mostly taken in the 1950s and called Early Color, was published. He later confided to an interviewer some of the likely reasons for his previous anonymity: “In order to build a career and to be successful, one has to be determined,” he suggested. “One has to be ambitious. I much prefer to drink coffee, listen to music and to paint when I feel like it.” Leiter, who died in 2013, took this picture, like nearly all of thousands of others, while walking in the few blocks around his apartment in New York. It is included in a new book of his work, Forever Saul Leiter, much of it found among his archive and published for the first time. The scene of butterflies being hung outside the porticoed building has all the formal levity that Leiter loved; though a picture of quiet and accidental slapstick, nothing in it, not the competing angles of the ladders or the man’s knee or the woman in the hat, seems a fraction out of place. “The street is like a ballet,” Leiter said. But only if you knew how to look. Leiter gave up one vocation for another. He came from a long dynasty of rabbis; his father was a revered Talmudic scholar and leader of Pittsburgh’s Orthodox Jewish community, who never forgave his son for dropping out of rabbinical school to become a “lowlife” artist – first a painter – in Manhattan. In a documentary film made about his life, In No Great Hurry, Leiter suggested that sense of familial disapproval never quite left him. Still, he said, he had swapped one form of devotion for another: “I don’t have a philosophy. I have a camera.” Forever Saul Leiter is published by Thames & Hudson (£19.99).

3/6/2022,"The pace of the crisis in Ukraine has created a brain-tangling complexity for anyone trying to understand what is going on. Now doomscrolling is back in ways not seen since the beginning of the Covid pandemic. Mental health experts are warning that public engagement comes with a cost in terms of anxiety that should not be ignored. Paul Salkovskis, professor of clinical psychology at the University of Oxford, who worked on measures to help people deal with Covid-related anxiety, said: “Clearly there are some people who are already anxious, who will be significantly more anxious, as happened with Covid – we saw a big increase in some subtypes of anxiety in the clinic. There will be some of that with this situation, but I don’t think it’s going to be the dominant response.” The cognitive theory of anxiety suggests that it is a response to threat, which can be entirely rational but needs intervention when it becomes disabling, explained Salkovskis, who is also a consultant at Oxford Health NHS foundation trust. “The question is, why for some people is it particularly severe? And why is it particularly persistent?” Uncertainty plays a role in assessing those questions, he said, and is part of the motivation underlying behaviours such as doomscrolling: the urge to understand the nature of the threat – how likely it is, what the consequences might be, how you might cope and who might be able to help. There are important differences between the impact of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. The requirement to socially distance made it harder for people to support each other, Salkovskis said. Public reaction in the UK and elsewhere to the war may seem trivial compared with the horrific realities for the people caught up in it, but it has also driven political action. Anger at the suggestion by Kevin Foster, the immigration minister, that Ukrainian refugees might apply for fruit-picking visas to come to the UK seemed to provoke a rapid change of policy at the Home Office. The modern response that many have of watching events unfold on social media means there are fewer people to empathise with, since other social media users seem distant and anonymous, even if they are identifiable. Dr Dean Burnett, a neuroscientist and honorary research associate at Cardiff university, said the fact the crisis was still unfolding meant people were experiencing a kind of perpetual cliffhanger that made it harder to disengage. “It would be great if you could just say, I don’t want to engage with this Ukraine situation, because it caused my anxiety to spike,” he said. “But because of the way the world works now, you’re cutting yourself off. It’s a lose-lose scenario.” Yet the war has more clarity than the pandemic, he added. “For most people, the big bad guy has attacked the underdog, and the underdog has put up more of a fight and the bully’s not getting his own way. It’s easier for our brains to understand. With the virus, it was harder to do that. It had no goals, no agenda – it’s just a pathogen. One of the reasons for the conspiracy theories was that people wanted to put some sort of narrative or order on to things.” Professor Barbara Sahakian, from the University of Cambridge’s Department of Psychiatry, said many people had been dealing with chronic stress since the lockdowns began, with threats from Covid and the cost of living, as well as the environment. “Now there are threats to European and global security,” she said. “To some, it may seem that there is never any good news any more. This is, of course, not true but it is important that people do not spend time doomscrolling but instead show resilience and gain mastery over the situation.” Juliet Landau-Pope, a productivity coach from London, has been looking for ways to help Ukrainians. She said: “I’ve had the news on round the clock. I’ve been waking up in the night and checking my phone, reading newspaper reports, and watching BBC constantly, CNN, the Times of Israel.” She has been searching out personal testimonies on Twitter, trying to find different sources of information. “It’s the fact everything has happened so quickly,” she said. “It’s not a question of what’s happening on a day-to-day basis, but hour by hour.” She is recovering from Covid and had been looking forward to going out again. “But I’ve lost all inclination to socialise. It feels too trivial.” Instead, on Saturday she went to a local church to donate clothes for Ukrainian refugees. It’s a pattern of behaviour familiar to Kay Worboys, a copywriter who became so concerned by her obsession with Covid facts that she began to train as a counsellor. “Last week, I could feel myself falling into the same trap I was in during the spring of 2020,” she said. “In the early days of Covid, I was online all the waking hours, looking for all the facts and figures. When I stopped to make food or a cuppa, I put the radio on. Before bed, I’d watch the news. Then, of course, I found I couldn’t sleep. And then last week I felt those old habits creeping in. Checking the news, having the radio on, doomscrolling on the train home, before bedtime, after watching the news.” Worboys became exhausted, anxious, angry and upset, particularly by some graphic images of a war victim she encountered on Twitter. “I’ve now limited myself to checking four times a day,” she said. Anna Cargan, who runs Buildabundle, a second-hand children’s clothes website, has also been trying hard not to engage. “I suffered an anxiety disorder in the past and I don’t want to go back there,” she said. “I’m not avoiding it completely – that would be impossible – but I’m definitely not immersing myself in news. Me scrolling won’t help Ukraine. I’m looking to donate to charities.”",News/Society,Obsessed? Frightened? Wakeful?

3/6/2022,"Brexit was always going to be a geopolitical and economic disaster – a once-proud nation cutting off its nose to spite its face. The daily tragedy of Putin’s laying waste of Ukraine has highlighted the shortsightedness of Johnson’s geopolitical misjudgment in leaving the European Union. As that great one-nation Tory Remainer Michael Heseltine says: “Our continent faces a threat as severe as anything since the end of the cold war. I am ashamed that the country that in my lifetime saved European democracy has now absented itself, and that others must now determine Europe’s response.” I am sure that my old friend the good Lord Heseltine means no disrespect to the “others” – our former partners in the EU. Like millions, he would like us to be in there as Europe unites itself in the face of the crisis. How ironic that members of the former Soviet bloc, which we encouraged to join the EU, are still there, whereas the bar-room joke is: who is going to join the EU first – the UK or Ukraine? The UK’s Brexit-induced economic disaster has not gone away simply because attention is understandably devoted to what is happening in Ukraine. And, of course, Pelion has been piled upon Ossa with the extra economic damage wreaked by Putin’s assault: the aggravation of shortages of energy supplies and the concomitant rise in an already disturbing inflation rate. It’s going to be a rough year for the British and many other economies. The economic damage to the Russian people from this invasion will be far, far worse. In the interests of his wild aims, Putin is prepared to inflict untold damage on his own people, as well as on the Ukrainians. Now, in order to switch off from such daily horrors I like reading, and re-reading, novels. I have recently been re-reading Reuben, Reuben by the little known – in this country – American humorist Peter De Vries. In part one, the narrator – one Spofford, a New England chicken farmer – bemoans the outcome of the family’s decision not to sell chickens to “New York commuters”. “Since commuters were two-thirds of our business,” Spofford reflects, “it don’t take no Einstein to figure what this retaliation is costing us. Talk about cutting off your nose despite [sic] your face.” Johnson, Farage and their Brexit cronies – encouraged by Putin and his cronies – managed to mislead the British electorate into voting Leave and thus departing from the world’s biggest barrier-free market when it was just 21 miles away. The British economy has not exactly lost two-thirds of its business, but it is now widely recognised that the hit has been substantial, with exports running almost 20% below what would have been expected in the absence of Brexit. Moreover, the many demands on Chancellor Sunak’s budget are not exactly alleviated by the impact on tax revenues of a Brexit-induced 4% reduction in GDP. The result? Unpleasant cuts in essential services. Which brings us to the chancellor’s recent pronouncement in the annual Mais lecture. Amid the usual platitudes about higher productivity and lower taxes was Brexiter Sunak’s emphasis on “a simple, enduring proposition: that the best way to organise our economy is around free-market principles”. Get it? So we leave the best free market in which we have ever participated – and which we helped to construct – in order to enjoy mysterious “freedoms” (since when, by the way, was “freedom” plural?), and the key to future economic progress is “investment”. In a passage that provoked a hollow laugh, Sunak asked: “Why is investment so low?” He added: “The problem is no longer the government: businesses simply aren’t investing enough.” Now, a glance at a number of surveys should have told the chancellor that the main reason why businesses are not investing enough is that they have been hit by Brexit. It comes up time and time again. Which brings us back to the chief culprit. The government has decided that we just have to live with the virus; and people are concluding that the ill wind from Moscow means that for the moment we shall also have to carry on living with “the Johnson”. But the charge sheet has not disappeared, as we are reminded when the prime minister complains that Putin is breaking international law. It takes one to know one. As a student of Latin, Johnson is no doubt familiar with that great observation in Tacitus’s Histories about another incompetent leader, the emperor Galba: “Maior privato visus dum privatus fuit, et omnium consensu capax imperii nisi imperasset.” (“He seemed much greater than a private citizen while he was one, and if he had never been in charge of government everyone would have agreed that he was fit to govern.”)",News/Business,Brexit didn’t just cost us money: it deprived us of solidarity in a crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/06/brexit-cost-britain-money-deprived-solidarity-ukraine-eu
3/6/2022,"Four overlapping black and white rectangles make up Israeli artist David Reeb’s painting Jerusalem. On two, an ultra-Orthodox Jewish man is portrayed praying at the Western Wall – known also as the Wailing Wall – from two different angles, his hands pressed against the stone. Opposite the images, thick brushstrokes spell out phrases in Hebrew: “Jerusalem of gold”, the title of a nationalistic song – and “Jerusalem of shit”. The work was among several explicitly political, daring pieces featured in an exhibition that opened in December at the newly renovated Ramat Gan Museum of Israeli Art near Tel Aviv. Because of its depiction of an ultra-Orthodox man, however, it was the only artwork in the show which drew the ire of the mayor of the city of Ramat Gan. Carmel Shama-Hacohen took to Facebook after visiting the exhibition, posting a picture of Reeb’s piece in which he said he found it racist and antisemitic, and asking his constituents whether they wanted it to be removed. Shama-Hacohen did not respond to the Observer’s requests for an interview. “It was ridiculous. If I am antisemitic then I’ve picked a strange place to live all my life,” said Reeb. “I didn’t take it too seriously at first. But it progressed from there into something crazy.” The show, called “The Institution: the museum and Israeliness”, was the first to be held at the museum after a four-year renovation, and the reopening was supposed to celebrate Ramat Gan’s growing reputation as an affluent and thriving city. Instead, the controversy over Reeb’s piece escalated into a standoff between many of the artists featured in the exhibition and the museum’s board of directors over its decision to take the painting down. The debate instantly turned political, as the deputy of the board is one of the mayor’s political rivals, and several other members are municipality officials on Shama-Hacohen’s payroll. A district court refused to intervene, and efforts at compromise centring on displaying the piece behind a screen, or only on Saturdays, when ultra-Orthodox Jews would not visit, failed. Fifteen of the other featured artists covered their own work with black cloth in solidarity with Reeb, and after the mediation process broke down, dozens of the group asked for their contributions to be removed. The museum closed its doors again just a few weeks later, sparking intense debate in Israel over freedom of expression, the role of public art, and who gets to decide whether works are bad or offensive. Svetlana Reingold, the museum’s chief curator, ended up resigning “Is it in the power of art museums in Israel to lead socio-political change, or are they inextricably linked to the institutional infrastructure?” she asked. Ironically, Reingold got a decisive answer. “I imagined [Jerusalem] would provoke criticism because it challenges the discourse on the limits of what is allowed. I did not imagine it would fall victim to local political censorship.” Reeb, 69, has had his work shown at Tate Modern and Documenta, Germany’s quinquennial exhibition. His art is deeply political, focusing on war and the occupation of the Palestinian territories: he usually works from his photographs taken at the scenes of protests in the West Bank and Jerusalem. The subjectivity of memory, along with a deadpan detachedness from what Reeb sees as an unresolvable conflict, are recurrent themes. As might be expected, his art has attracted criticism in the past. A piece critical of former prime minister Ariel Sharon was removed from the Tel Aviv Museum of Art in the 2000s, and in the 1980s a series featuring posters in red, black, green and white – the colours of the Palestinian flag – was taken out of the same museum’s catalogue. Jerusalem, created in 1997, drew on his experiences visiting the old city of Jerusalem for the first time since he was a child, the artist said. On the one hand, it was very moving to see Jewish people freely praying at the Western Wall; on the other, he realised that the access for Jews was possible because the Muslim Mugrabi Quarter, which used to stand next to the Wall, was torn down after the 1967 six-day war. “I wanted to say something about how the wall is viewed with sentimentality, that the idea of it, the idea of Jerusalem, doesn’t match the reality,” Reeb said. The piece was exhibited at art spaces in Israel on two occasions before, but did not provoke the same reaction it got in Ramat Gan. “Art should ask questions, it’s part of what makes any art interesting. I don’t think there are many instances in which art is dangerous. Whether I like something or not doesn’t mean it should be forbidden. Where is the limit if you go down that road?” he asked. Reeb wonders if the tone of public debate is changing in Israel. “The readiness to use antisemitism as a way to attack anything that challenges nationalistic symbols is new, I think. “Financing issues means that there can be a tendency to self-censorship. That type of thing happens everywhere, of course. But here there are also questions about the occupation and its broader effects: freedom of expression and art are victims of that. The situation is not about to change anytime soon… I don’t know if Israel can really be a democratic place until then.” Haaretz, Israel’s leading leftwing newspaper, called the Ramat Gan affair a “turning point for culture in Israel”. Dozens of other Israeli museums and galleries, both public and private, hung black flags at their entrances in the wake of the row. But for Diego Rotman, who also showed work at the Ramat Gan exhibition and hung a black cloth over his Deller Sukkah installation in protest, the episode also represented an “outstanding example of solidarity, organisation and collective power”. “The decision to go and take down the works was hard for the artists and for the museum, so it was a type of sacrifice for the sake of artistic autonomy,” he said. “We showed that a museum isn’t just a building: It’s not about the space, it’s the people you work with and how you work with them. “I think it shows that in the end, we are the ones with the power, not a mayor who intervened in a professional undertaking for his own political reasons.” Several members of the Knesset are now working towards drafting legislation that would protect the independent decision-making power of curators and artistic directors from their governing boards. For the time being, the Ramat Gan museum, its paint still fresh, stands dark and empty – an unexpectedly perfect reflection of what the curator, Reingold, described as the “built-in tension between art and politics”.",News/World news,Feud over ‘antisemitic’ Wailing Wall painting closes Israel museum,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/06/feud-over-antisemitic-wailing-wall-painting-closes-israel-museum-david-reeb
3/6/2022,"Zoë Kravitz is show-business royalty, the daughter of actor Lisa Bonet and musician Lenny Kravitz. I expected her to be candid – throughout her career she’s been outspoken: on race and Hollywood, on body image and politics. In 2017, she starred in a British Vogue video in which she yelled, while sharing odd items she keeps in her handbag, “Fuck Trump!” And when we meet one evening via Zoom – me in London, her in LA – she doesn’t disappoint. Here she is, easygoing and thoughtful in conversation, an A-lister speaking her mind rather than the asinine niceties offered by more careful celebrities. “I’m just a fucking nerd,” she says at one point, though only half-convincingly. “A weirdo!” She’s bundled up in a hoodie and beanie hat, makeup free apart from a delicate cat-eye flick of eyeliner, which feels appropriate. We’re meeting to discuss The Batman, her new film, in which she stars as Selena Kyle, otherwise known as Catwoman, opposite Robert Pattinson. The Batman is made by the American director Matt Reeves, who has described Kravitz as “smart, funny, honest, unpretentious”, and “a great creative partner”. To get into character, Kravitz watched videos of big cats and gradually adopted their physical attributes. “It was fun to play with different ways of walking, of being agile,” she says. “You know, you can’t read cats, which is why a lot of people feel uncomfortable around them.” Kravitz conceptualised Kyle as someone who is “tough, a street-smart person. Her life has been really difficult and she’s figured out a way to survive this far and take care of herself, and she really cares about other people in similar situations.” To prepare for the role, she trained for four months. Was Kravitz, who had eating disorders as a teen, worried that the intense scrutiny on her body might prove triggering? “No, actually,” she says. “I was focused on being strong versus being thin. It’s a physical part. I wanted to make sure it felt believable that she was physically capable of doing all the things she was doing. I was actually stronger and more healthy than I’ve been in a long time.” And the iconic catsuit? I ask. How was that? Undignified. “I was like a two-year-old,” she laughs. “If I needed the toilet, someone had to escort me in and out.” Given her background, it seems Kravitz was destined for the limelight. When I ask whether she ever considered having a civilian job – something dry and non-flashy, not acting but accountancy – she immediately brightens. “We used to joke,” she says, “that my version of rebellion would be, like, to become a lawyer or something. My dad would say that sometimes, because I’m good at arguing. But I don’t know how I could ever have an office job. I struggle with that kind of structure or authority in general.” Her mother was fired from the Cosby Show spin-off A Different World when she became pregnant with Zoë by Lenny, who was already an up-and-coming musician; her paternal grandmother is Roxie Roker, the lead on pioneering 1970s sitcom The Jeffersons, the first show to depict an inter-racial couple on primetime TV. After her parents separated when she was a toddler, her mother remarried Aquaman actor Jason Momoa (they recently separated); her father has variously dated Nicole Kidman, Vanessa Paradis and Adriana Lima. Like her father, who is an actor-musician, Kravitz, 33, is a polymath. She is the face of French fashion house Saint Laurent. She is in a band, LOLAWOLF. She is working on a solo album with Taylor Swift collaborator Jack Antonoff, though she is tight-lipped on what we should expect. It’s the only part of our interview where it feels as if she’s holding back; I suspect it’s because the album may touch upon her divorce from the actor Karl Glusman. (Kravitz filed for divorce in December 2020, mid-pandemic, after 18 months of marriage.) “It’s a living, breathing thing,” Kravitz says, vaguely, of the album. “And I’m not quite sure where it will end yet.” Her parents were people who “broke down boundaries in a lot of ways”, she says. “They both dealt with being artists who didn’t act or dress or look or sound the way a Black person was supposed to act in terms of what white people specifically were comfortable with.” But growing up between LA and Miami, and later in Manhattan, Kravitz sometimes felt uncomfortable with her heritage as a biracial woman. “I felt really insecure about my hair,” she says, “relaxing it, putting chemicals in it, plucking my eyebrows really thin. I was uncomfortable with my blackness. It took me a long time to not only accept it but to love it and want to scream it from the rooftops.” The turning point was “realising what it meant,” she goes on, “for my grandmother to get a job on The Jeffersons, and be a Black woman on TV, and what it meant for her to be in a biracial relationship on television. And to hear stuff that my mother tells me about being a biracial girl in the 1970s, and being abused or being spit on, and what that felt like, you know?” I ask whether her parents ever gave her “the talk” about racism before she entered Hollywood. “They never warned me or anything,” Kravitz says. “I think they were more focused on trying to make sure I understood that despite the colour of my skin I should be able to act or dress or do whatever it is I want to do.” Kravitz is strategic about the roles she takes; her agent won’t pass on those that are explicitly about race, lest she becomes pigeonholed. “At one point,” she says, “all the scripts that were being sent were about the first Black woman to make a muffin or something. Even though those stories are important to tell, I also want to open things up for myself as an artist.” Kravitz believes the reason her character in the HBO blockbuster Big Little Lies was so multi-layered is, in part, because “it was originally written for a white person.” When on location for Big Little Lies in California, “There were a few moments where I felt a little uncomfortable,” she says, “because it is such a white area.” I ask her to elaborate. “Just weird racist people in bars and things like that.” Big Little Lies, in which she stars opposite Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon, Laura Dern and Meryl Streep, and is very much their equal, came at a good time for Kravitz. For years, she kicked around in underpowered roles on the periphery of films. She was the thinly written sidekick to Shailene Woodley’s lead in Divergent. She was a fringe superhero in X-Men: First Class. She realised early on that she had to train herself not to fall in love with roles before she won them – it was too heartbreaking when things didn’t go her way. Her mother would counsel her: rejection is protection. “Even though it’s sometimes hard to see that in the moment,” Kravitz says, “usually a few years later, you’re like, OK, this is why this didn’t happen.” One rejection stands out. In 2012, Kravitz attempted to audition for the Batman film The Dark Knight Rises, but was told she was too “urban” for the role. “I don’t know if it came directly from Chris Nolan,” she says, anxious not to impugn the reputation of an award-winning director. “I think it was probably a casting director of some kind, or a casting director’s assistant… Being a woman of colour and being an actor and being told at that time that I wasn’t able to read because of the colour of my skin, and the word urban being thrown around like that, that was what was really hard about that moment.” When the news later broke that Kravitz would be starring in The Batman, “it was crazy,” she says, half-smiling, a flicker of triumph in those curiously feline eyes. “My phone was blowing up more than any birthday I’ve ever had.” Kravitz’s role in The Batman puts her steadfastly in A-list territory. But it was Big Little Lies, which became a critical and commercial hit for HBO, that was her launchpad. Meatier roles soon followed, including the gender-swapped Hulu reboot of the 1995 romantic comedy High Fidelity, in which she starred and executive produced. That show got mixed reviews and was cancelled after one season. “It sucked,” she says of the cancellation. “It hurt. And I do think it was a mistake.” Kravitz is currently preparing to shoot her directorial debut, Pussy Island, a Me-Too inspired thriller about a young waitress who sets out to seduce a business magnate. “I love to write, I love to edit,” she says, “but acting often really stresses me out, because I feel like I’m there to serve the director and I don’t want to let them down.” Moving to directing feels more instinctively comfortable. “The psychology of humans is really interesting to me,” she says. “And behind the camera, I still get to do that, without the performance part.” The Batman was originally slated for a June 2021 release date, but production shut down due to the pandemic. “It was crazy,” Kravitz says, of the day that filming stopped. “You’re away from home and you’re focused and ready to go and you’ve been training for months… It was scary for a lot of people, not knowing if the shutdown was going to be for a week, or two weeks. It ended up being six months.” At the time, Kravitz was filming in the UK, so she spent the first three months of lockdown in London, watching government press conferences and walking in nearby Hampstead Heath. “I was like everyone else,” she says. “Tiger King and movies and food and all of that.” It was a strange, lonely time. “I don’t have a lot of friends in London, so it was super isolating.” Eventually, Kravitz returned to her upstate New York home, where she hunkered down and watched films, tried to stay in shape for when production resumed. “When something like that is going on,” she says, “all you want to do is sit on the couch and eat snacks, and stuff. And I did that plenty. But I was also trying to keep my regimen a little bit because I’d worked so hard already.” New York is her favourite place in the world, but lately it’s felt oppressive. “I love to walk around and be a part of that city,” she says. “But there have been times where I’m, like, I’m not going to leave my house today, because I don’t feel emotionally capable of protecting myself energetically from that.” By “that”, Kravitz means being recognised in the street – she does not enjoy being famous. “It’s a hard thing to talk about,” she says, “because no one wants to feel bad for people who have wonderful lives.” Kravitz attempts to explain what this constant surveillance feels like: “You go into a coffee shop and everyone is looking at you, so you’re spending all of your energy trying to act like you don’t see everybody looking at you. And it’s the little things: I’ll be putting my coffee lid on, and it’s like, don’t spill it, because if you do it’s going to be on the internet… It’s like being the new kid in school every day.” She is scathing about Instagram accounts like Deux Moi, which share candid pictures of unsuspecting celebrities. “People think that what they’re doing is OK – taking pictures of people when they’re trying to eat or have a personal conversation,” she says. “And if you say, ‘Don’t do that,’ they don’t care. It’s weird to not be considered a human being, which is what it feels like in those moments.” In September 2021, Kravitz deleted all her Instagram posts, bar one promoting The Batman. She’d previously been a prolific poster, sharing candid photos of her famous friends to her 6.5m followers. But over the years she was repeatedly flamed on social media. In January 2021, she was criticised for not deleting a birthday post to her friend, fashion designer Alexander Wang, after abuse allegations were levelled at him. In September 2021, things came to a head when Kravitz attended the Met Gala in a sheer mesh dress. When she posted the outfit on Instagram, users criticised her for going “practically naked”. The incident was the catalyst for Kravitz wiping her entire account. “It hurt my feelings,” she says, with a wry laugh. She’s clearly stung by the criticism. “I was really hurt. No matter who you are, how confident you are, people telling you that you’re disgusting, or that you should kill yourself, it doesn’t feel good… I think by creating a literal area, a comment space, for someone to tell me what they think [about me], I realised that was starting to affect my mental health and also the way I affect decisions. Even with my art, you know, thinking about what people are going to say. As an artist, that’s like, death. It’s dangerous to start caring about what other people are going to think, or what they do think.” She is scathing about social media call-out culture. “People are not expressing or doing what they want to do, because they’re afraid of getting into trouble,” Kravitz says. “We’re not leaving room for growth. It’s all based on shame and fear. It’s completely out of control.” The month we speak, Eddie Redmayne said his decision to play a trans woman in the 2015 film The Danish Girl was “a mistake”. “The idea of certain actors not being able to play a certain part,” says Kravitz, “because you’re not that thing in real life, I think that’s really dangerous. Because I don’t know what acting is, if we’re not allowed to play someone. It’s about empathy. It’s about stepping outside yourself.” It’s a brave position to take, when the easier thing would be to shy away from discussing controversial issues. But I suspect that, at this point in this career, after working for so long to get to the centre of the frame, Kravitz would rather just tell it like it is. “There have definitely been moments in my life where I’ve felt like I needed to soften my edges in some way,” she says, firmly. “I think that’s something most people go through, regardless of what industry you’re in. Not wanting to take up too much space, or the idea that women need to be pleasant or something. And now, I’ve had a really great few years just feeling OK with taking up space, and not getting it right every time. And that’s been really, really liberating.” The Batman is now in cinemas across the UK",Arts/Culture,‘I’m OK with not getting it right every time’: Zoë Kravitz on growing up famous and getting her claws into Batman,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/06/im-ok-with-not-getting-it-right-every-time-zoe-kravitz-on-growing-up-famous-and-getting-her-claws-into-batman
3/6/2022,"British nationals urged to leave Russia amid the fallout of the war in Ukraine are facing fraught journeys back to the UK, with reports of tense border crossings, visa problems and disruption caused by flight cancellations. The UK government updated its travel advice yesterday to “strongly advise” those whose presence is “not essential” in Russia to consider leaving now. In a statement on its website, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: “If your presence in Russia is not essential, we strongly advise that you consider leaving by remaining commercial routes.” While some Britons living in Russia told the Observer they were planning to stay despite the latest advice, others want to leave but are struggling. ​One British man, 29, who has lived in Moscow for six years​,​ said he faced a choice between staying in the country or being separated from his Russian wife. She does not currently have a passport because they married in October and she recently applied for a replacement with her new name. The new document is not due to arrive for another 10 days, meaning she cannot leave or begin applying for a UK visa. “I don’t know what we’re going to do,” he said. “In the last week, 15 or 20 of my friends have left. Everyone has left; literally everyone.​ ​The embassy would say, ‘You should leave.’ But I can’t. What do I do? Leave my wife here on her own? I can’t do that.” The education consultant from London, who asked not to give his name, fearing complications, said they felt like “sitting ducks” but were living “hour to hour”. “It’s incredibly tense living here because you don’t know what’s going to happen in the next couple of hours or days. Who knows what they’re going to bring in?” Other Britons have had to go to extreme lengths to leave Russia, including travelling hundreds of miles to cross via land into Estonia and Latvia, or paying thousands of pounds for flights via roundabout routes, passing through the Middle East or Turkey. Russia has seen severe disruption to air travel with sanctions causing widespread cancellations. Aeroflot, Russia’s flagship air carrier, yesterday announced it was halting all international flights, although airlines serving destinations including Qatar and Dubai were understood to be continuing to operate yesterday. There are no direct flights to the UK. ​Some of those making it to the border ​have reportedly been subjected to tense questioning by border officers, including having phones searched. “People who are leaving via airports or land, as a result of this new law, they are checking everyone’s Instagrams, Facebook statuses, checking the posts you’ve liked, checking through your Whatsapp, Telegram conversations, everything,” one British national said. “You have to be careful. It’s a time to be cautious.”",News/World news,Britons face fraught journeys overland and delays to find a way out of Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/06/britons-face-fraught-journeys-overland-and-delays-to-find-a-way-out-of-russia
3/6/2022,"Alissa Timoshkina was brought up on a “beautiful diet” of Ukrainian and Russian dishes. Growing up, she remembers her great-grandmother – a Ukrainian Holocaust survivor who emigrated to Siberia following the second world war – pounding lard and frying vegetables to make a hearty beetroot borscht (Ukrainian soup). Now the Russian chef has joined forces with her Ukrainian best friend, Olia Hercules, in a show of unity in the face of war. The London-based pair, both 37, are the force behind Cook for Ukraine, an initiative that uses food to raise awareness about the conflict and funds to support the humanitarian effort. Modelled on Cook For Syria, the charity culinary movement that went global in 2016, the campaign encourages everyone to celebrate Ukrainian and eastern European culture by cooking traditional meals, and possibly donating to a JustGiving page. The hope is that over cabbage pie, varenyky dumplings or Ukrainian challah bread, diners will be more likely to discuss the latest developments. They might be inspired, in turn, to donate to the relief effort. It seems to be working so far: Cook for Ukraine’s JustGiving page has raised more than £75,000 in donations in just over a week, with the money going to Unicef to support children and families impacted by the fighting. Top chefs and restaurants have signed up to offer support, with many choosing to add a Ukrainian special to their menu and donate some or all of the proceeds to the appeal. Soho House, for example, has added a Ukrainian dish at all restaurants globally, while Burger & Lobster is donating £2 from every bill throughout March. Yotam Ottolenghi, the Israeli-born chef, is also offering support. “Restaurants I love and chefs I deeply respect have come on board, which has been amazing,” Timoshkina said. The inspiration for Cook for Ukraine came the day after Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Timoshkina and Hercules – who have been close friends since they met while studying at Queen Mary University in 2005 – were at the first protest outside Downing Street against the invasion. “I felt quite ashamed: maybe it’s going to be completely inappropriate for a Russian to do this. To the world right now, we are the equivalent of Nazi Germany,” said Timoshkina, who has lived in the UK for 23 years. “But Olia said, ‘Please stop being embarrassed. Stop equating Russians to Putin.’ It was really, really helpful to hear her say that.” That night, Timoshkina had a lightbulb moment. She called Hercules with the idea for Cook for Ukraine, and then contacted Clerkenwell Boy, the anonymous Instagram celebrity chef who launched Cook For Syria. “I asked for some tips on how he started it but he said, ‘Don’t worry. We’ll support you throughout. Let’s just do it.’ The donations started flooding in immediately.” The friends hope the initiative will help keep attention on Ukraine in the weeks to come, even if the news agenda begins to move on. “We’re so oversaturated with news of various conflicts, and people’s attention spans are so short,” Timoshkina said. “Sadly, in 10 days, people might not care as much. “When you put a relatable message forward with human faces and things people can physically relate to, like food, we’re really hoping the message will be a lot more long-lived and people will sustain their interest. It’s an aim to get really close to people’s hearts and stomachs.” That the initiative is led by a Russian and Ukrainian together is “really important” for the world to see, she said. “In a way we are symbolising the two sides of the war. But we are hugging and smiling and, for us, there is no conflict, just love, food and community,” she said. “Food is a symbol of people coming together. The idea of breaking bread: there’s nothing more beautiful and peaceful than that.”",News/World news,Russian chef joins forces with Ukrainian best friend to serve food across frontiers,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/06/russian-chef-joins-forces-with-ukrainian-best-friend-to-serve-food-across-frontiers
3/6/2022,"Two Sundays ago I wrote in the Observer about the last remaining Russian independent TV station, Dozhd (“TV Rain”), and the irrepressible spirit of Natalya Sindeyeva, the woman who pioneered and ran it. Keeping the station alive had cost Sindeyeva her home and her marriage and her health and her security. A dozen years ago when she launched Dozhd she had been a vivid Russian celebrity, a “dancing queen” of Moscow’s elite party circuit, now her mugshot is posted on street corners as a “foreign agent”. The defiant struggles of Dozhd to stay on air and to continue to report the truth in Russia despite years of intimidation and sanction from the Kremlin were the subject of an inspiring documentary, “F@ck This Job (Tango with Putin)”, made by London-based Vera Krichevskaya, which was released in the UK last week and broadcast on the BBC. A few days after “F@ck this Job” came out, on Friday, the decade-long defiance of Dozhd was silenced, at least for a while, by a brutal new law, passed unanimously in the Russian parliament, which bans news organisations from reporting anything except state approved press releases (it is now illegal for any broadcaster to call events in Ukraine, for example, “a war”). The new legislation, which has also caused the BBC and most other news organisations to suspend its reporting in Russia, will see journalists and media owners who contravene it jailed for up to 15 years. BBC director general Tim Davie said the law “appears to criminalise the process of independent journalism”. Its most chilling effects have been felt among the few surviving liberal Russian media outlets like Dozhd and Novaya Gazeta, whose editor, Dmitry Muratov, winner of last year’s Nobel Peace Prize, announced that the paper’s website had been forced to remove all of its material on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, saying “there is no doubt that the threat [of prosecution] will be realised”. On Friday afternoon I spoke by Zoom to Natalya Sindeyeva and Dozhd’s deputy news editor, Dmitry Elovsky, and the documentary maker Vera Krichevskaya. They appeared ashen-faced on screen, all still struggling to process exactly what had happened. The law against what the Kremlin inevitably described as “fake news” had, they said, “changed everything overnight” within Russia. How did the authorities define “fake news”? I asked. “Anything that is true,” Sindeyeva said. Last weekend Sindeyeva had been in London to attend the first sold-out screenings of “F@ck this Job”. She had returned hurriedly to Moscow on Monday after sanctions against Russia had been announced, to be with her children when it first seemed likely that borders might close. On the plane back home, she suggested, she still believed that Dozhd could continue to broadcast to its millions of Russian viewers – at least on the YouTube channel to which it had long been confined. By Wednesday, that no longer felt possible. Dozhd’s editor-in-chief Tikhon Dzaydko and his wife had been receiving vicious death threats all week, after their contact details had been distributed online. They decided they had no choice but to leave the country. Sindeyeva was hearing a number of reports that “special police forces were heading to our newsroom along with pro-Kremlin mobsters”. Krichevsakya had crossed the border from Finland by car the previous day to attend a planned premiere of “F@ck this Job” at Moscow’s largest cinema. Only a few hours before that event was due to begin she received a call that the premiere – and the screening of the film across the country – had been cancelled in light of bomb threats. When we spoke, the director had managed to escape Russia and get a flight to Istanbul and then another to Tel Aviv. Sindeyeva and Elovsky did not disclose their locations. When Sindeyeva had launched Dozhd as “the optimistic channel” a dozen years ago, during the brief window of greater openness that attended Dmitry Medvedev’s presidency, she sought to create a vivid space in which a vision of a progressive Russia might exist. The channel would celebrate youth and tolerance. It remained a champion of gay rights when new laws were brought in that criminalised the “promotion” of same-sex relationships. It courageously reported from Chechnya and Ukraine and gave a platform to opposition leaders Boris Nemtsov (before his murder in 2015) and Alexei Navalny. Sindeyeva’s inextinguishable sense of a brighter future kept it going. Two weeks ago, she told me “I’ve always been optimistic and I’m still optimistic. For me, this means that the good guys will take over eventually. But also there is one more important thing to say about that. Optimism is not dreaming, it also says, ‘Get your ass up from the chair and try to make things happen.’” A fortnight on a lot of that spirit had been drained from her, at least temporarily. “Now,” she told me on Friday, “for the first time ever, I have no hope. I cried all morning on Wednesday, before going into the office for the meeting at which we decided to cease broadcasting.” Her tears had given way to characteristic solidarity with her station’s staff who had never before missed a news bulletin despite, over the years, being kicked off networks and hounded out of their offices. They had even for a while set up a full news studio in Sindeyeva’s Moscow apartment. Closing down felt, Sindeyeva said, “like the decision a mother has to make in a war, to hide her kids in the basement”. For their last broadcast Sindeyeva joined the entire news team in front of the camera to say goodbye to viewers. “No to war,” she said, as a farewell, with a bleak smile. The station then cut to some old footage from the ballet Swan Lake, an ironic gesture to the films that Soviet state television had once routinely broadcast when news was censored. By Wednesday night, Sindeyeva and Elovsky were watching the lights go out on information channels and websites in Moscow one by one, first YouTube feeds then Facebook. “It was so sad,” Krichevskaya said, “to wake up on Thursday morning with none of my usual notifications from Dozhd.” Overnight, the only source of independent news in Russia had become Telegram posts on which friends and colleagues shared fears that the borders would soon be closed. A plane on which Krichevskaya’s mother was travelling from St Petersburg was diverted and grounded for 13 hours while passenger details were checked. All the talk between journalists, Elovsky said, was how to effectively erase media histories from phones and computers in light of the new law. “It feels like an iron curtain is returning,” he said. Sindeyeva, with a weary note of defiance, insisted that she saw the closure of Dozhd as a pause rather than anything more permanent. She had seen imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s call for Russian citizens to take to the streets to protest Putin’s war, but she doubted it had been heard widely. “People are panicking, they don’t know what will happen next,” she said, “And now there is no way for them to hear news that might tell them.” “F@ck This Job (Tango With Putin)” is available to watch on BBC iPlayer.

But with the plethora of great options and formulations available, it seems a shame not to experiment. We have been conditioned to only consider one way to wear eye shadow – shading, blending, etc – but let’s throw out the rulebook. Get yourself a thin brush, dip it into your eye colour of choice (metallic if you are feeling bold) and simply draw on your required shape. Team with bushy brows, barely there lips, skin and lashes – and voilà! The modern way to go for gold. 1. Revitalash Lash and Brow Mask £40, revitalash.co.uk2.

Laura Mercier Lip Glacé Hydrating Balm Gloss £24, lauramercier.com Recently, I had a conversation that made me realise what a brilliant invention shower oils are. We were discussing how much, in recent times, the act of bathing has become even less about cleansing (has it ever been about cleansing?) and more about shutting out the world’s ills as you soak off the debris of the day. Using a scented, non-greasy bath oil, brimming with essential oils and herbs that help to de-stress, revive and relax you, elevates the experience. But then we conceded that, of course, on an environmental level, having constant baths is not great. Also, lets face it, baths can be a faff – especially if you’re in a hurry. So why not tap into the wonders of a shower oil? I am completely sold on this and for the following reasons, I think Aromatherapy Associates provide some of the very best shower oils on the market. There are four equally desirable options. ‘Rose’ – very uplifting – is a floral lover’s dream. ‘Muscle’, as you’ve guessed, is great for aches and pains. ‘De-stress’ is the one you reach for when you’ve had a crap day. ‘Revive’ – a blend of rosemary and grapefruit – is the perfect response to lethargy. They all smell exquisite and fill your bathroom with an aroma that transports you to a magical spa. The oil-to-milk texture is not gunky, it cleanses properly but gently and leaves skin beautifully hydrated And the price? Well, that really is a no brainer.

3/6/2022,"Three out of five women say their caring responsibilities for children and other vulnerable or elderly relatives are preventing them from applying for a new job or promotion, while only one in five men say the same, according to new research. The poll of 5,444 people by Ipsos Mori and the charity Business in the Community (BITC) found that nearly half the workforce are combining paid work and care. Almost three in 10 adults have left or considered leaving a job because of difficulties in balancing work and care. The latter was particularly true of women. The majority of those with care responsibilities in the UK are parents looking after children under the age of 18, but 36% of carers are responsible for an adult of working age or older. Those from a black, Asian, mixed race or other ethnically diverse background were significantly more likely to say they have caring responsibilities than those from a white background. As many as 50% of carers from an ethnic minority say their caring responsibilities are holding them back from applying for promotions or new positions at work, compared to 39% of white carers. BITC Gender Equality campaign director Charlotte Woodworth said the results showed the disconnect between what workers – particularly women and people from ethnic minority backgrounds – need from employers and what they experience in the labour market. “There’s a lot of competing ideas about how we should try to improve the lot of women, how we should try and create a more levelled-up society. This report tells us very clearly how significantly workplace policies and workplace cultures are undermining those efforts,” she said. Workers on low incomes are among the most badly treated. While some 75% of those earning £26,000 or more said they felt supported by their employer to manage their caring responsibilities for children, this dropped to just one in two people earning less than that amount. The research shows nearly one in 10 carers are “sandwich carers”, meaning they have caring responsibilities for both a child and an adult. Instead of expecting women, for example, to somehow juggle it all, workplaces need to change, Woodworth says: “It’s very clear that some groups are much more dramatically affected than others, and have a much harder time than others, but it’s not about problematising those groups, it’s about the workplace shifting its expectations, its norms, its cultures to better reflect the needs of the people who are trying to engage with it.” The charity wants the government and employers to offer new fathers more ring-fenced, paid time off to look after their children when they are born, so that childcare responsibilities can be shared more equally between couples from the start of a child’s life. The research found that even among women who identify as joint carers, 52% say they do “more than my fair share”, in comparison to 10% of men. One in three men admit they do “less than my fair share”, in comparison to 4% of women. Women are also significantly more likely than men to say their day job has been interrupted because of caring responsibilities, with many women saying they do more than their fair share because their partner’s working pattern or culture is unsupportive of work and care. She hopes employers and the government will see the pandemic as a watershed moment. “The pandemic was bad for a lot of people with care responsibilities, and it was particularly bad on the gendered front. When lockdown happened, women were more likely to be furloughed and working mothers were more likely to lose their jobs than working fathers.” But at the same time, she says, the pandemic made everyone more aware of the challenges faced by working carers. “It did have the effect of making people more aware of how hard it is to combine paid work with care, and it challenged and debunked a lot of old-fashioned ideas around what effective and productive work looks like.”",News/World news,Caring roles block career advancement for three in five women,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/06/caring-roles-block-career-advancement-for-three-in-five-women
3/6/2022,"The report last week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on the need to adapt to global warming made stark, unpleasant reading. Described by the UN secretary general, António Guterres, as “an atlas of human suffering”, it revealed that billions of people now live in parts of the world where they are highly vulnerable to climate change. Death tolls from droughts, floods and storms are destined to increase in these regions as extreme heat events and inundations become more frequent. Only urgent action today can halt the worst impacts and prevent a global calamity, argued the IPCC. In a normal news week, warnings as dire as these would have made front-page headlines in British newspapers. Events in Ukraine ensured they were pushed inside, however. It is not surprising that the unfolding humanitarian crisis occurring in eastern Europe should be the prime focus of our attention and concern. However, there is a danger that the battle for Ukraine may divert attention from the approaching climate change crisis. Even before Russia launched its invasion and triggered a leap in fuel prices, some Conservative backbench MPs had been pressing for the government to cut back its green agenda, a move that has since been followed with calls for fracking to be resumed in the UK in order to boost fossil fuel production and help curb fuel price increases. These manoeuvres are being mounted by a collection of MPs and peers known as the Net Zero Scrutiny Group. They have tried to blame the government’s green agenda for a cost-of-living crisis, which they say would be better addressed not by raising national insurance payments and imposing green levies but by cutting taxes, resuming UK shale gas extraction, and slowing down the rate at which we impose carbon emission cuts. Nor are these campaigns confined to the UK. Across the EU, calls have been made for the bloc to reactivate old, decommissioned coal plants “as a precaution and in order to be prepared for the worst”, as the German economy minister, Robert Habeck, said last week. Such proposals are alarming and the threats they pose should be made clear to the public. In the case of shale gas production, there is simply not enough in the UK to make up for the decline in our reserves of North Sea gas, which have been occurring for more than a decade. Fracking is also deeply unpopular with the public and given that any shale gas extracted would have to be sold at international market prices, it would have no impact on UK fuel bills. Shale gas has no part to play in the generation of power in a Britain committed to playing a leading role in the battle against global warming. Nor is it realistic to consider reopening coal plants. Coal is the dirtiest of all fossil fuels and any return to its widescale burning across Europe would send the worst possible message to developing nations currently resisting pressure to close down mines and ancient power plants as part of the international programme aimed at cutting back carbon emissions. The real lesson from the battlefields of Ukraine is that Britain needs to rid itself of its fossil fuel addiction entirely and become self-reliant on electricity that is generated cleanly and efficiently. We need to do that to protect our energy supplies, while at the same time sending a message to the rest of the world that we take the coming crisis extremely seriously. The need to follow this course of action is reflected in the final words of last week’s IPCC report: “Any further delay in concrete anticipatory global action on adaptation and mitigation will miss a brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a livable and sustainable future for all.”",Opinion/Opinion,The Observer view on Ukraine and the climate emergency | Observer editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/06/observer-view-on-ukraine-and-climate-emergency
