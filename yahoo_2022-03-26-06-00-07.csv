 Russian troops reportedly attacked their own commanding officer by running him over with a tank after many in their brigade were killed amid the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainian journalist Roman Tsymbaliuk said in a post on Facebook that Russian Col. Yuri Medvedev was attacked after fighting in Ukraine left nearly half of the men in the 37th Motor Rifle Brigade dead, The Washington Post reported. Tsymbaliuk said the brigade injured both of Medvedev's legs by hitting him with a tank, causing him to be hospitalized, according to the newspaper. The incident occurred roughly 30 miles from Kyiv, in Makariv, Ukraine, the Post reported. The country reportedly retook the town this week after Russia gained control of it earlier in the war. A senior Western official told the newspaper that he thinks Medvedev has died, saying the incident shows the low morale among the Russian troops in Ukraine. He was killed ""as a consequence of the scale of the losses taken by his own brigade,"" the official said, according to the Post. NATO estimated earlier this week that as many as 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed as Ukraine continues to mount fierce resistance against Moscow's assault. Several high-ranking officers are reported to be among the deceased, with Russian officials reportedly confirming Sunday that a navy commander had been killed and Russian state TV saying last week that one of the country's top commanders had died, among others. Russia has been accused by the U.S. of committing war crimes in the conflict, as Ukrainian officials say Moscow is targeting civilians and structures such as hospitals, schools, residential buildings and bomb shelters.",World/The Hill,Russian troops attack own commanding officer after suffering heavy losses,https://news.yahoo.com/russian-troops-attack-own-commanding-192031366.html
3/26/2022,"After nearly four decades, an ancient secret buried deep in Windows 1.0 has been discovered by an intrepid digital archeologist. It’s a simple Easter egg, but one which was most likely impossible to find back in the day. As spotted by PC Gamer, Lucas Brooks is a big fan of Microsoft’s graphical operating system, Windows. Brooks is often seen tweeting about various things he has found in older builds of Windows, including Easter eggs. And recently he discovered a never-before-seen secret in Windows 1.0 RTM (the RTM stands for “release to manufacturing”). A credits list, featuring the names of all the folks who helped create Window 1.0, can be found hidden inside a bitmap file.

That’s because, according to Brooks, the tools needed to extract a bitmap file from an NE (new executable file format) didn’t exist when Windows 1.0 was released. And even if someone did manage to rip out the bitmap, they wouldn’t have been able to spot the extra, encrypted data hidden in the file.
 While Brooks was able to reverse engineer the secret, discovering the credits list in the process, they have yet to figure out how to actually access the Easter egg in Windows 1.0 without doing some hacking. It’s believed that there is some series of keystrokes in Windows 1.0 that will unlock the secret credits list. This is how it works in all later versions which also have hidden credits and similar secrets. But for now, nobody has been able to figure that out.
 You may recognize one of the names in the newly discovered credits. Valve co-founder and president Gabe Newell is listed in the Easter egg and that’s because…he worked there. He left Microsoft in 1996 along with Mike Harrington to create Valve and start work on their first game, Half-Life. I wonder how that all worked out…

3/26/2022,"The first three months of 2022 have not been what the doctor ordered when it comes to easing drought concerns in California, particularly following a very wet December that resulted in a surplus amount of rain and snow in the Golden State. With spring underway and the end of the rainy season in sight, AccuWeather forecasters say there is some good news on the way following the recent stretch of record-breaking warmth and dry weather. ""A storm tracking eastward across the Pacific Ocean will likely arrive along the shores of Central California on Sunday evening and bring a swath of much-needed moisture,"" said AccuWeather Meteorologist Alyssa Smithmyer. Record highs have been tied or broken across much of the state this week and the hot, dry weather has only worsened drought conditions. Los Angeles International Airport recorded a high of 84 F on Wednesday, tying the daily record last set in 2008. In nearby Burbank, California, Bob Hope Airport recorded a high of 89, breaking the previous daily record for March 23 of 88 degrees from 1953. Unseasonable warmth will stick around into the weekend before Mother Nature delivers rainfall and cooler air. In some locations, precipitation amounts may equal or exceed what has fallen so far in all of 2022 combined. ""There is the potential for Los Angeles to double its rainfall for the entire year so far with this storm,"" stated AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Alex Sosnowski. Downtown Los Angeles has recorded only 4% of its normal rainfall with 0.34 of an inch of rain since Jan. 1, but that total may be doubled by the time Monday is over. The downtown area typically receives about 9 inches of rain during the first three months of the year. ""Rainfall amounts ranging from 1 to 1.5 inches may be possible along the south-central coastline of California from late Sunday to Monday,"" said Smithmyer. Local rainfall between 2 and 4 inches can occur along some of the south- and west-facing mountainsides as well. While the rain is certainly needed and beneficial, downpours can raise the risk of flooding and debris flows in areas recently burned by wildfires. Even outside of heavy rain, the wet roads may lead to travel disruptions. The worst travel conditions across Southern California will be on Monday, including both the morning and the evening commutes. The large storm system will bring areas of stiff winds that can contribute to problems for motorists and especially for operators of trucks, trailers and buses. Along with drenching rain, thunderstorms are also in store for some locations of Southern California. A few communities can be hit with strong wind gusts and hail. CLICK HERE FOR THE FREE ACCUWEATHER APP According to the United States Drought Monitor, the entire state of California is in moderate drought or worse. More than 90% of the state is experiencing severe drought conditions, and almost 40% of California is experiencing extreme drought, which is the second-highest drought category. The state's exceptional drought, the worst category, was wiped out with the ample December precipitation, but conditions have been deteriorating due to the lack of precipitation in January, February and March. Other cities along the California coast have received more rainfall thus far in 2022, but the amounts are still well below normal. The 0.73 of an inch in San Francisco is just 7% of the normal 10.06 inches through March 24. San Diego has fared slightly better with 1.78 inches, which is one-third of the typical 5.39 inches. Even though temperatures will be lower compared to previous days, cold air is not expected with this system as snow levels persist around 7,000 feet in elevation. Without snowpack building in the mountains, this will not provide needed runoff during the normally dry summer months. With the end of the wet season on the doorstep, this may be one of the last opportunities for any substantial rain or snow, at least in Southern California. ""By Tuesday and Wednesday, the storm will likely be tracking into the central Rocky Mountains, and dry conditions are expected to return to California,"" said Smithmyer. Looking down the road, forecasters say there may be another opportunity for precipitation sometime during the first full week of April. Colder air may be in place by then, which may provide more of an opportunity for snow at somewhat lower elevations in the mountains. However, snow in the mountains of California typically begins to melt rapidly in April, so this may provide only a temporary boost to lakes and reservoirs.
