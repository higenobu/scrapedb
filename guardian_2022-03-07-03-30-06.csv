3/7/2022,"Who will stand up for the children in care who are being let down, as evidenced by repeated scandals? The home owned by Robert McGuinness in Bolton, and closed in January after Ofsted discovered a child who had not changed his clothes or bathed for months, is an egregious example of the casual neglect that has spread like a stain across the sector. Mr McGuinness, the Guardian revealed last week, spent thousands from a community interest company set up for educational purposes on bars and holidays. The company claimed that the spending was a legitimate form of salary sacrifice. But while his behaviour was extreme, the official neglect of vulnerable children that made it possible is far from isolated. Alternative provision settings that educate pupils excluded from mainstream schools in England do not all have to register with Ofsted. Business owners do not even undergo basic checks. Mr McGuinness’s company already has planning permission for eight studio flats for care leavers aged 16 to 18. This is the type of accommodation where, between 2018 and 2020, 22 children died. The former children’s commissioner for England Anne Longfield described the government’s attitude to the most vulnerable young people in our society as “deep-rooted institutional ambivalence”. The Howard League for Penal Reform has warned that moving children long distances can “play into the hands of abusers”. A ruling against the callous practice of placing children in non-care settings, including lightly supervised bedsits, in the judicial review brought by Article 39 would help. But the problems in the children’s social care sector are wider than this. Funding cuts, and record numbers of children in care, have left councils desperate to shift the burden of responsibility. Increasingly, foster placements as well as children’s homes are delivered by private providers, many of which have opaque ownership structures and extract huge profits. CareTech Group, for example, made nearly £70m in pre-tax profits last year and awarded a £12,000-a-month “relocation allowance” to its chief executive, Haroon Sheikh, for his move to the United Arab Emirates. This is the wrong model. While councils may initially reduce overheads by outsourcing difficult work, cutting corners by relying on low-paid, private-sector workers will do nothing to improve the prospects of a demographic who already face obstacles. The kinds of “high-quality life story work” called for recently by MPs, because it helps young people to make sense of complex experiences, is impossible if placements and social workers are constantly changing. Care standards must be raised. Every setting and provider should be subject to rigorous regulation, with moves disallowed unless they are in a child’s best interests. A review by Josh MacAlister, ordered by ministers, is expected soon. But while Mr MacAlister has criticised operator profits, he has so far declined to support the campaign to lift the care-leaving age, and the signs that he will demand the kind of overhaul that would place children’s interests first, with a strengthened national framework for councils to adhere to, are not good. Campaigners, charities, MPs and everyone who thinks these children matter should prepare a robust response.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on privatised children's services: deregulation failures | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/06/the-guardian-view-on-privatised-childrens-services-deregulation-failures
3/7/2022,"A ship carrying Russian oil that was moored in north-west England has moved on after workers made it clear they would not unload the cargo. The German-flagged Seacod was moored near the Stanlow oil refinery in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, but moved away on Sunday, heading north. On Friday the Unite union said it had informed Stanlow’s owner, India’s Essar Group, that its members would “under no circumstances unload any Russian oil regardless of the nationality of the vessel which delivers it”, echoing steps taken by counterparts at a gas terminal in Kent and in the Netherlands. A ban on Russian vessels introduced last week by the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, does not cover cargo, allowing several ships to dock since then despite carrying gas or oil that was ultimately purchased from Kremlin-controlled entities. Unite’s general secretary, Sharon Graham, urged Shapps “to close this loophole immediately”. It was not clear if the oil was unloaded before unions became aware it was Russian. A government spokesperson said: “It is mandatory for all ports and harbours to follow legislation banning all ships that are Russian-owned, operated, controlled, registered or flagged, from entering British ports. The government will support all ports in exercising their responsibilities.” They added: “Ministers are exploring options to further reduce the already small amount of imports we do get from Russia and we continue to urge Europe to put in place plans to end their dependence on Russian gas.” The Essar Group said: “Essar remains deeply concerned by the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Ukraine and is fully complying with the statutory framework implemented by the UK government with regard to Russia-related entities. “Earlier this week, we turned away two cargoes of non-Russian-origin crude oil which would have been delivered in Russian-flagged tankers. We can confirm that a German-flagged vessel was approved to berth at Tranmere oil terminal by the port authority on Thursday 3 March. “This vessel set sail for Tranmere on 22 February, before the invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent introduction of UK government sanctions. For a number of days, we have been working urgently to find alternative sources of diesel while simultaneously ensuring uninterrupted supply of fuel to the north-west of England. “Essar will continue to comply fully and will respond promptly to any changes the UK government may make to the statutory framework of sanctions.” At the weekend Shell defended continuing to buy crude oil from Russia saying it was necessary in order to keep energy flowing through Europe. The fossil fuel company said it made the “difficult decision” to buy an oil shipment from Russia on Friday after intense talks with governments about the potential risks to energy security. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, publicly criticised Shell over the the shipment. “Doesn’t Russian oil smell [like] Ukrainian blood for you?” he wrote on Twitter. I am told that Shell discretely bought some Russian oil yesterday. One question to @Shell: doesn’t Russian oil smell Ukrainian blood for you? I call on all conscious people around the globe to demand multinational companies to cut all business ties with Russia. Shell said it would not have been able to source enough oil from other countries in time to cancel the shipment, and would have otherwise risked disrupting energy supplies across the continent. “We didn’t take this decision lightly and we understand the strength of feelings around it,” Shell said in a statement released on Twitter. “We will continue to choose alternatives to Russian oil wherever possible, but this cannot happen overnight because of how significant Russia is to global supply.” Read Shell's statement. pic.twitter.com/6mN7KVTiGc Shell announced last Monday that it would exit its joint ventures with Russian state energy firm Gazprom, which are collectively worth about $3bn. It means pulling out of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which was due to double Russian gas imports to Germany. Berlin recently called a halt to the project in the light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It followed similar moves on the previous day by BP, which announced it would offload its 20% stake in the Kremlin-owned oil firm Rosneft. Despite corporate efforts to reduce ties with Russia and sanctions imposed on individuals, banks and some financial transactions, EU and UK governments have so far stopped short of imposing restrictions that would cause energy shortages within their own borders. Shell said it would consult with humanitarian agencies on how best to use profits from the “limited amount” of Russian oil it buys to help Ukrainians affected by the invasion.",News/Business,Ship forced to move on after dockers at UK refinery refuse to unload Russian oil,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/06/ellesmere-port-cheshire-dockers-uk-refinery-ship-russian-oil
3/7/2022,"Keir Starmer has been forced to restore Labour’s credentials as a pro-national security and patriotic party, his former director of communications has said, amid criticism that Jeremy Corbyn was too soft on Russia in the aftermath of the Salisbury poisoning. Ben Nunn, who advised Starmer for four years, said the Labour leader had brought “clarity where previously there had been ambiguity” about support for Nato, allowing the party to appear “once again a government-in-waiting” in its response to the invasion of Ukraine. Starmer said on Sunday he fully supported the UK government’s actions, given he believed Russian president Vladimir Putin hoped to divide western countries. However, the Labour leader has called for ministers to pursue faster and tougher sanctions. Writing in the Guardian, Nunn said Starmer was “well versed in matters of national security” as a former human rights lawyer. Recalling the response to the Salisbury poisoning, Nunn said Starmer was “firm on where he wanted to stand” and that “Russia should be condemned for their involvement and we should fully back the action being taken by the government.” By contrast, Nunn said, on his way to film an episode of Question Time in March 2018 with Starmer, who was then shadow Brexit secretary, an article by Corbyn was published which contained “no condemnation of Russia for the attack”. Corbyn wrote for the Guardian at the time that either the poisonings were a “crime authored by the Russian state; or that state has allowed these deadly toxins to slip out of the control it has an obligation to exercise”. He said that Russian authorities “must be held to account on the basis of the evidence” but added the UK should “not manufacture a division over Russia where none exists” and told people not to “rush way ahead of the evidence”. Corbyn also cited “flawed intelligence and dodgy dossiers” from previous international crises, saying these had become “overwhelmed by emotion and hasty judgments too many times”. “I remember my stomaching sinking. How on earth can we defend this?” Nunn wrote. He said that on the television that night, Starmer “turned up, contradicted Corbyn, condemned Russia ‘without reservation’, backed the government and demanded strong action”. Nunn continued: “It’s often underestimated how damaging that moment was for Labour. At best the response was confused, at worst it appeared ambivalent about terrorism on British soil. “It fed into a narrative with voters that when it came to our nation’s security Labour was soft and an even deeper sense that we were no longer a party that would stand up for Britain. “Changing that perception has been a fundamental part of Keir’s mission since he became leader two years ago.” Nunn said he firmly believed Starmer should deliver speeches with the union jack behind him to demonstrate Labour was a patriotic party and that its leader was “proud to stand with our nation’s flag”, and derided those who treated the measure “flippantly”. As well as the political optics, Nunn said Starmer’s support for national security was also rooted in principles. Corbyn’s office was contacted for comment. His allies believe his response to the Salisbury poisoning has been drastically misrepresented. They pointed to his calls in the same article in March 2018 for a crackdown on Russian oligarchs’ influence in the UK, which are now being taken forward by the government. Corbyn himself has also previously accused Putin of rigging elections, and accused the Russian leader of being guilty of war crimes in Syria. The former Labour leader, who stood down in April 2020, said after the invasion of Ukraine that “we have to apply political pressure on Russia and support the public pressure that’s there in Russia to end this war and withdraw those Russian forces”. He added: “All wars end with a political solution … Why don’t we cut out the fighting zone and go straight into the talking zone?” Tensions have grown between the incumbent and previous Labour leadership teams over their approaches to military conflict, particularly the Stop the War coalition. Starmer last month said the group were naive and “actively give succour to authoritarian leaders who directly threaten democracies”. But Corbyn said “there is no evidence anywhere they’ve done anything other than stand up for peace around the world.”",News/Politics,"Starmer has restored Labour’s strength on national security, says former aide",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/06/starmer-has-restored-labours-strength-on-national-security-says-former-aide
3/7/2022,"The Frenchman Christophe Laporte led Jumbo-Visma to a dominant podium one-two-three on the first stage of Paris-Nice on Sunday. Laporte joined forces with his teammates Wout van Aert and Primoz Roglic to power away from the dwindling bunch on the short final climb of the 159.8km stage which started and finished in Mantes-La-Ville, north-west of Paris. A final bunch sprint had been anticipated but the sprinters fell away on that final ascent with Laporte, who signed for Jumbo-Visma for the 2022 season after seven years at Cofidis, launching the decisive attack which left the peloton trailing. Laporte worked effectively with Roglic and Van Aert to distance the chasers and he finished in 3hr 48min 38sec and took the leader’s jersey. The time gained by Roglic, Jumbo-Visma’s team leader from Slovenia, is likely to prove significant come the end of the eight-stage race. 🇫🇷 #ParisNice🥇🥉🥈 pic.twitter.com/nzBXoiBdO4 Pierre Latour (TotalEnergies) finished in fourth place, 19sec behind the leading trio. Jumbo-Visma animated the stage throughout, with Rohan Dennis and Mike Teunissen attacking earlier in the race and splitting the peloton. “If someone would have told me at the start of the day that I would win the stage with three of us at the finish together, it’s incredible,” Laporte told Eurosport. “I want to say thank you very much to the team. They told me with one kilometre to go that I would win the stage.

3/7/2022,"Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine has prompted demonstrations around the world, with hundreds of thousands taking to the streets to condemn the war. But anger towards the Russian leader has also ensnared an unlikely casualty: a French-Canadian delicacy of potato fries, cheese curds and gravy. Poutine, the famous dish, shares its name – in French – with the maligned Russian president. And as Putin becomes the target of protest, so too has one restaurant that sells the dish. Maison de la Poutine, with restaurants in both Paris and Toulouse, said it has received insults and threats following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Our dish was born in Quebec in the 1950s. And the stories to tell its origin are numerous. But one thing is certain: poutine was created by passionate cooks who wanted to bring joy and comfort to their customers,” the company tweeted. “The House of Poutine has worked since its first day to perpetuate these values and today brings its most sincere support to the Ukrainian people who are courageously fighting for their freedom against the tyrannical Russian regime.” The row follows a decision by a Quebec-based diner to pull the name from the menu. Le Roy Jucep, which claims to be the birthplace of poutine in the 1950s, said it was distancing itself from the name, instead describing itself as “the inventor of the fries-cheese-gravy”. “Dear clients, Tonight the Jucep team decided to temporarily retire the word P**tine from its trademark in order to express, in its own way, its profound dismay over the situation in Ukraine,” the diner recently wrote on Facebook, before pulling the post. The name of the dish is widely believed to come from the a French-Canadian pronunciation of the English word “pudding” to describe the mushy medley. In English, differences in pronunciation mean that there can be little overlap with the Russian leader’s name. But the French transliteration of Putin – already tweaked to avoid confusion with the expletive putain – has left ample room for crossed wires. “People, please stop confusing Putin and poutine,” tweeted one user. “One is a dangerous and unwholesome mix of greasy, lumpy and congealed ingredients, the other is a delicious food.”",News/World news,Poutine not Putin: classic Quebec dish off the menu in France and Canada,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/06/poutine-not-putin-classic-quebec-dish-under-fire-in-france
