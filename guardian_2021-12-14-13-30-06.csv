12/14/2021,"Australian women are weary and whiplashed. Weary from two years of intense unpaid care work, including months of remote schooling their kids, and whiplashed from two severe periods of job and hours loss. As the Covid recovery picks up speed, many women are wondering what work in 2022 might look like. Employers should be too. Losing more jobs and hours of work than men in the 2020 lockdown, women roared back into paid employment in late 2020 to post a historic 61.9% participation rate in March this year. But it wasn’t too long before Delta emerged, and the 2021 lockdowns hit women even harder: 61.5% of jobs lost between June and October. The question is: will women return to the labour market with the same enthusiasm they demonstrated after the 2020 lockdowns?  Many are exhausted from months of pandemic-induced stress, including uncertainty about the health of family and friends, income loss, intensified care responsibilities and remote schooling. Frontline workers in health, retail and other essential services have been more exposed to the virus and have had to negotiate difficult and frequently changing public health orders and work conditions. Others are dazed by the on-again, off-again nature of their employment under lockdown. Australia has the most highly educated and skilled prime age female labour force in the OECD. Last month the ABS reported 50% of young women aged 25 to 34 have a university degree. This is productivity gold. Governments and employers are starting to prioritise women’s labour force participation, seeing it as the most effective way to boost productivity and to drive the Covid recovery. But our labour markets, our employment options and our care systems are not yet fit for purpose. The pandemic has shone a spotlight on many of the barriers and obstacles that limit women’s ability to take part in work at a level that reflects their skills and aspirations. It has also provided an opportunity to experiment with new ways of working previously thought impossible. With the end of the year upon us, it seems that rather than a “great resignation”, many Australian women are engaging in the “great contemplation” – how to work, care and survive, and perhaps even thrive in 2022? Rather than put the onus on women to solve this problem, we propose five urgent things that business and governments can do right now to supercharge women’s participation in work in 2022, to build an inclusive recovery that delivers economic security and wellbeing to all. First, provide the high-quality flexibility that employees want and need to thrive. Employees have been crying out for the high-quality flexible work that makes their job fit with the rest of their lives. Working from home during the pandemic was the first taste many had of how flexibility might work. Previously some employers have resisted, or their employees have been too afraid to ask. Lockdown mandated work from home for about one-third of the labour force. The sky did not fall in! Initial data shows productivity remained high and many workers were more satisfied. But we can’t just assume remote or hybrid working will make work more equitable. Evidence shows that when done poorly, it can embed new gendered inequalities. To avoid this, we need carefully designed high-quality flexible options that support all workers to maintain their career development. Now is the time to be asking employees about the types of flexibility they want to make use of and to put in place the systems and the technology that will make it possible. Second, build good secure jobs into the organisation, your supply chain and across the economy. Our research shows that women want and need secure and predictable hours to make life work, they want more hours and to work in higher skilled and better paid roles. Yes, they want flexibility, but they want control over the hours they work to schedule essential care support for children or aged parents. Women will flourish in good secure roles. Third, design mutually supportive work and care systems. When we survey and run focus groups with women, they tell us they struggle to access the high-quality care supports they need to fully take part in work at the level and hours they prefer. Some young women tell us being a working parent looks too hard and had put off or changed their minds altogether about having kids. Governments and employers wanting to prioritise women’s workforce participation will have to attend to both sides of the work/care equation if they are to improve women’s labour supply and fully access this talent pool. Care services are essential economic infrastructure, an investment in human capital, in future economic prosperity and community wellbeing. They also support family formation. Governments that rethink finance and delivery of these essential public goods as part of the Covid recovery will reap significant dividends. Employers who implement generous care policies will too. Fourth, if you really value women, pay them properly and provide them with a career path. Australia has one of the most gender-segmented labour markets in the OECD. The fact than men dominate in sectors which are more secure and highly paid and women are concentrated in sectors with high levels of insecurity, low pay and poor career paths is one of the reasons for our stubbornly high gender pay gaps. These silos need to be broken open with good jobs, career paths and economic security available for all. Fifth, we urgently need to build respect for women at work. Women have said “enough” to ongoing harassment, disrespect and violence. Kate Jenkins’ 2020 Respect@Work report and the fierce advocacy of young leaders like Brittany Higgins and Grace Tame have made it clear that bad practice is too common. It hurts those who are targeted, and it damages economic security. Business and political leaders must step up, take responsibility and act. This must happen now. Action by business and government in these five vital areas will lay the foundation to “build back better” for gender equality in 2022.

12/14/2021,"Kentucky’s governor Andy Beshear broke down in tears on Monday as he announced the deaths of at least 74 people from Friday’s deadly tornadoes that swept across multiple midwest and southern states, and warned that the death toll is expected to grow. The ages of those killed ranged from a few months to 86 years, six of them younger than 18, Beshear said at an emotional press conference in Frankfort, the state capital.  He said that 109 Kentuckians were still unaccounted for and that the eventual number of confirmed deaths might not be known for weeks. “I know, like the folks of western Kentucky, I’m not doing so well today. And I’m not sure how many of us are,” he said, his voice faltering. Crews continued to sift the devastated ruins of towns across multiple states on Monday as many grieved and survivors shared harrowing tales of their escape. Kentucky was the worst hit of eight states where dozens of tornadoes whirled through in massive nighttime storms that leveled whole communities. Across the state, about 26,000 homes and businesses were without electricity, according to poweroutage.us, including nearly all of those in Mayfield. More than 10,000 homes and businesses have no water and another 17,000 are under boil-water advisories, Kentucky Emergency Management Director Michael Dossett told reporters. Joe Biden declared a major federal disaster in Kentucky, where representatives of a candle factory in the small city of Mayfield reduced to eight the number they said were still unaccounted for. Another eight of 110 shift workers are known to have died after an unseasonal, record-breaking tornado with whirling winds up to 200mph razed the building. The US president plans to visit Kentucky on Wednesday. Federal agencies, Biden said, were “working like the devil” to get affected states the help and resources they needed. “We have the entire federal team, not just the folks going in and making sure people are still around [or] breathing under the debris,” Biden said. “That’s the immediate, urgent thing, just to get food and water to people who don’t have it.” But he added he was worried about the mental health of survivors, too, many of whom he said were on fixed or lower incomes. “What do you do? Where do you go? It’s not like if you’re making $16,000 a year you get on the plane and head to your relatives in Washington,” he said. “That’s what worries me most, the uncertainty. You can see it in people’s faces.” As rescuers continued to search the wreckage in Mayfield and across the state, thousands remained without power and water, or homeless. Bob Ferguson, spokesperson for Mayfield Consumer Products that owns the candle manufacturer, said: “There were some early reports that as many as 70 could be dead in the factory. One is too many, but we thank God that the number is turning out to be far, far fewer.” Kentucky was hit by five tornadoes, authorities said. “One stayed on the ground in Kentucky for at least 200 miles, devastating anything in its path. Thousands of homes are damaged, if not entirely destroyed,” Democrat Beshear said. In addition to the deaths in Kentucky, the tornadoes also killed at least six people in Illinois, where an Amazon distribution center in Edwardsville was hit; four in Tennessee; two in Arkansas, where a nursing home was destroyed and the governor said workers shielded residents with their own bodies; and two in Missouri. The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration announced Monday that it has opened an investigation into the collapse of the Amazon warehouse in Illinois. Amazon’s Kelly Nantel said the Illinois warehouse was “constructed consistent with code”. Illinois governor JB Pritzker said there would be an investigation into updating code “given serious change in climate that we are seeing across the country” that appears to factor into stronger tornadoes. A warehouse worker, David Kosiak, 26, said: “It sounded like a train came through the building. The ceiling tiles came flying down. It was very loud … We were in the bathrooms. It was at least two and a half hours in there.” Outside a wrecked apartment complex in Mayfield, Kentucky, residents spoke of being trapped in the debris for hours and crying for help as they tried to escape. Johnny Shreve watched from his window as an office structure across the street disintegrated, then dived onto his kitchen floor as the tornado hit his building and chunks of concrete pelted his body. “It felt like everything in the world came down on me,” he said. He posted on Facebook that he and his dog were alive, and added: “Y’all pray for Mayfield.” “It blew my mind when the sun came up,” Shreve said, when he and others returned to salvage what they could and trade stories of survival. A local pastor, Joel Cauley, described the scene at the candle factory. “It was almost like you were in a twilight zone. You could smell the aroma of candles, and you could hear the cries of people for help,” he said. “Candle smells and all the sirens is not something I ever expected to experience at the same time.” The factory was reduced to 15-ft deep wreckage of twisted metal, with corrosive chemicals spilled everywhere and smashed cars on top, where the roof had been. Wanda Johnson, 90, a resident of an apartment block in the nearby town of Wingo, spoke of her windows “bursting” and how she clung to a door frame in an effort to avoid being blown away. “Dear God, help me, please help me get out of here,” she recalled saying. Speaking from a shelter beside her son and granddaughter, Johnson said: “They tell me we don’t have a town. Everything’s gone. It’s just wiped away. It just flipped over our city. “We don’t know where we’re going to go. We don’t know what’s left to go to.” More than 100 others were in the shelter with Johnson. Aid agencies have set up similar facilities in churches, school gymnasiums and community halls across Kentucky and elsewhere to provide warmth, food and clothing. Michael Dossett, director of Kentucky’s division of emergency management, said national guard troops and other agencies were bringing in generators. Power restoration in some areas “will be weeks to months,” he said, amid nighttime temperatures below freezing. “This will go on for years to come,” he said. “This is a massive event, the largest and most devastating in Kentucky’s history.” Weather experts were analyzing the unprecedented nature and severity of the unseasonal tornadoes. More than 80 tornadoes were reported in eight states, prompting Biden to ask the US environmental protection agency to investigate what role the climate crisis might have played.",News/US news,Kentucky tornadoes: governor says death toll expected to grow as crews sift through ruins,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/13/kentucky-tornadoes-death-toll
