12/11/2021,"Steven Gerrard admits that returning to Liverpool as an opponent for the first time will stir sentiments he must subdue. The Aston Villa manager says he does not know what kind of reception awaits him at the club he served with singular distinction as a player but his mission is to ensure it has no bearing on the outcome of an eagerly anticipated Premier League clash.  “Of course there’ll be emotion because of where it’s at and my history with the team we’re playing against, Liverpool, but that’s the challenge, to try to control it as much as I can,” Gerrard said. “I’ll respect [the reception] in terms of whatever happens but one thing I can assure Aston Villa fans is I’m going there to try to win and take something from the game. I think there’s a lot of noise around it, understandably, but for me I have very much prepared for the game as I always do.” He continued: “I’m going to Anfield, of course looking forward to it because I’ve had some fantastic memories in the place,” before, when asked to cite the best of those memories, mentioning two highlights from the triumphant 2004-05 Champions League campaign: his famous goal against Olympiakos in the final group game and the semi-final win against Chelsea thanks to Luis García’s “very clear goal”. But he declined invitations to dwell on those memories, repeating: “I’m going there as the Aston Villa manager and trying to take points.” In true opposing manager style, he even tried to shift the spotlight on to the other team. “I think there is more pressure on Liverpool,” he said, suggesting the Premier League title race is so tight that Jürgen Klopp’s team have no room for slip-ups. “At their end of the table I don’t think they can afford to drop points. For us it is about focusing on our game plan to go and try to make it as difficult as we can.” Gerrard, then, is intent on frustrating Klopp, a man and manager whom he admires greatly. “I have the utmost respect for him as a guy but also as a coach. He’s always gone out of his way [to support Gerrard]. He was one of the first on the messages when I got the job at Villa and we were regularly in touch when I was at Rangers. “I’m sure we’ll have a working relationship moving forwards, but he is a winner and a competitor, and so am I. For the 90 minutes we’ll want to take whatever we can off each other. That’s the nature of us as people: we are competitors.” Villa have enjoyed three wins in four matches under Gerrard, with a defeat by Manchester City the only blemish. Matt Targett and the former Liverpool striker Danny Ings are fit to compete for starting places again, increasing Gerrard’s belief that his team can silence the Anfield crowd. “We have a gameplan and have confidence we can take something,” said Gerrard.",Sport/Football,Gerrard admits ‘there will be emotion’ as he returns to Liverpool with Aston Villa,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/10/steven-gerrard-liverpool-aston-villa-emotion-return
12/11/2021,"Ralf Rangnick will not try to persuade Paul Pogba to stay at Manchester United if the midfielder wants to go. The France international is in the final year of his deal and can sign a pre-contract agreement with another team from January. Rangnick was asked what he could do to influence Pogba to agree fresh terms and whether it was worth keeping a player who did not wish to remain at the club. “I wouldn’t say he’s not worth keeping,” the interim manager said. “But players have to want to play for a big club like Manchester United. If a player does not want to play Manchester United in the medium or long term, I don’t think it makes sense to convince him to change his mind.  “But let’s wait and see, I have spoken with him [Pogba] for 15 minutes over the phone a few days ago [Tuesday]. Let’s have him come back, get fit, train with the team and see where we stand, how the team has developed by then. “He can be an important player but this is true for all the other players we have. I’m not just the coach of Paul Pogba, I’m also the coach of all the other players and my ambition is to make them better, improve each individual player, and this is only possible by improving the performance of the whole team.” Mino Raiola, Pogba’s agent, indicated the player was open to a move, but only to clubs offering comparable wages. “We have many offers for him, including a contract extension,” he told the German TV channel Sport1. “We’ll see what’s best for him.” Pogba was due to return on Friday from a rehab programme in Dubai for his calf injury, with Rangnick to speak face-to-face with the 28-year-old on Sunday. Rangnick stated that in future he wants all recuperation to occur at United. “As far as I can tell the medical department is really very good, with many different approaches towards rehab,” he said. “I would not want players to do their rehab abroad or anywhere else – the decision on Paul was taken before I came. “I have already spoken to the medical department – to Steve [McNally] our doctor, to Robin Sadler [head of rehab] – that in the future I want players with injuries to stay here.” Rangnick said he viewed Pogba’s best position being at the base of midfield in his preferred 4-2-2-2 formation. The manager has injury doubts regarding Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Nemanja Matic for Saturday’s trip to Norwich.",Sport/Football,Ralf Rangnick will not try to persuade Paul Pogba to stay at Manchester United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/10/ralf-rangnick-paul-pogba-manchester-united-contract
12/11/2021,"Repeated bouts of carelessness were never going to sit well with a manager as demanding as Thomas Tuchel. The German cut a frustrated figure after Chelsea’s 3-3 draw with Zenit St Petersburg on Wednesday, his displeasure clear as he laid into his side’s new habit of coasting when they have a lead, and he knows that there is no option but to respond when Leeds visit Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Suddenly the prospect of falling away from Manchester City and Liverpool feels all too real. After looking so polished a few weeks ago, the European champions have allowed standards to slip. They lost first place in the Premier League after their 3-2 defeat at West Ham last Saturday, while the draw with Zenit leaves them at risk of a difficult draw in the last 16 of the Champions League, and Tuchel needs to see a change in attitude. “We have had good performances, we have had average performances,” Chelsea’s manager said. “But average and good sometimes looks horrible if you wear a Chelsea shirt. Ninety-five per cent is not enough.”  Tuchel, always articulate and intelligent, was honest in his analysis and was entitled to point out that injuries have taken a toll. The loss of Ben Chilwell to a potentially season-ending knee injury has disrupted Chelsea’s balance at left wing-back, with Marcos Alonso a more ponderous alternative, and midfield is an issue. N’Golo Kanté’s knee injury refuses to go away and Mateo Kovacic’s return from a hamstring injury has been disrupted by Covid. Jorginho, weary after a draining year, is battling through hip and back pain. Wearing a wry smile, Tuchel said that the midfielder would be playing on one and a half legs against Leeds. The problem is that Jorginho is essential. He was overrun against West Ham, but Chelsea missed him when Tuchel experimented against Zenit. With Ruben Loftus-Cheek not risked after picking up a minor injury in the warm-up in St Petersburg, Reece James moved inside from right wing-back to partner Ross Barkley and the result was Zenit repeatedly tearing through the middle to expose Chelsea’s increasingly error-prone defence. “Reecey will start as a wing-back [against Leeds],” said Tuchel, who is trying to come up with solutions. Saúl Ñíguez, who filled in at left wing-back against Zenit, is yet to convince in midfield. “We’re talking about being relentless,” Tuchel continued. “We talk about N’Golo, we talk about Kovacic, we talk about Chilwell. These guys are about high speed.” Chelsea, who have won two of their past five league games, are a different proposition with Kanté fit. It cannot be a coincidence that the Frenchman was absent on the four occasions when Tuchel’s side have conceded more than once in a game. The defensive structure is not as sound without Kanté’s energy. Loftus-Cheek is not as dynamic. Chelsea have become easier to play against and a previously rock solid defence has started to suffer. That is partly due to a levelling out; it always was fanciful to expect Chelsea to shut out opponents for ever. Or for Édouard Mendy, who was jittery before letting in Arthur Masuaku’s freakish winner for West Ham, to keep making astonishing saves. But away from the tactical concerns, there is talk of contract uncertainty unsettling the dressing room, with César Azpilicueta, Andreas Christensen, Antonio Rüdiger and Thiago Silva available for free at the end of the season. Of that quartet, only the 37-year-old Silva is definitely expected to agree a one-year extension and stay. Azpilicueta, the club captain, has not played much and could return to Spain. Meanwhile, negotiations with Christensen and Rüdiger have stalled. Christensen, poor against Watford, West Ham and Zenit, has frustrated the hierarchy by changing his mind after agreeing two contracts and there has been no movement on Rüdiger’s deal. Chelsea have offered the German a contract worth £140,000 a week but he wants closer to £200,000 and it is understood that the club’s position is unlikely to change. As it stands Rüdiger, who can agree a pre-contract agreement with foreign clubs from 1 January, is expected to join Real Madrid next summer. “We have to be patient,” Tuchel said, but he needs it sorted out. Chelsea cannot afford to have distractions. Tuchel knew that they were lucky to beat Watford last month and he was livid at how they let four leads slip against Zenit and West Ham, slamming his players for changing their behaviour after going ahead. “We were not outclassed,” he added. “We were outworked.” The question for Tuchel is whether that complacent mentality is ingrained in this squad. Antonio Conte, José Mourinho, Frank Lampard and Maurizio Sarri made similar complaints during their spells at Chelsea. “That would be worrying, if it is like this,” Tuchel said. “Then it’s my job to stop it. It is very difficult to come to this kind of level where we have pushed ourselves. It’s maybe even harder to stay there.” Chelsea have not been in a title race since winning the league under Conte in 2017. They have the firepower – Romelu Lukaku and Timo Werner scored against Zenit – but can they stay with City and Liverpool? “Are we ready to be in a title race?” Tuchel said. “I don’t know. Until now it seems like it. We just have to go back to our highest level. Then we can produce consistent results. Then it’s horrible to play against us.”",Sport/Football,‘Are we ready for a title race?’ Tuchel seeks solution to Chelsea setbacks,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/10/thomas-tuchel-wants-to-see-return-of-relentless-chelsea-after-setbacks
12/11/2021,"Rafael Benítez has told Lucas Digne that the team come first but refused to elaborate on why the Everton full-back was dropped for Monday’s home win against Arsenal. The France international was omitted from the squad when Everton recorded their first win in nine games and Benitez admitted his only senior left-back was not guaranteed to return at Crystal Palace on Sunday despite being fit.  “It is clear – the manager decides,” Benítez replied when asked about Digne’s absence. “He has been training today and we will see tomorrow if he is available or not. We need all the players around because that increases the competition, but at the same time everyone has to be focused and realise the priority has to be the team. What he has to do is ensure he continues working hard and the team is ahead of any individual.” Digne has used social media to play down reports of a falling out with the Everton manager. Benítez refused to comment on claims the pair argued over the full-back’s more defensive role this season. “Normally when you have conversations with players they are private conversations and you have to keep them private,” he said. “The only thing I can say is he’s been training and we have to decide tomorrow if he’s available or not. I cannot comment any more because we are talking about something else when we have just beaten Arsenal the way we did and we have Crystal Palace coming.” Benítez has insisted his January transfer plans will not be disrupted by an exodus of the recruitment staff. After Marcel Brands’ exit as director of football on Sunday, Grétar Steinsson, the head of recruitment and development – who was appointed by Brands – and Dan Purdy, manager of scouting and operations, have decided to leave. “The club is reviewing the structure and in the end they will make a decision on the way we want to move forward,” Benítez said. “But we cannot stop anyway. The scouting department has been working on names for a while and we have a lot of contacts, and we know more or less what we are looking for. I’m sure the owner is already working on possibilities to improve the squad.”",Sport/Football,Rafael Benítez tight-lipped over Lucas Digne’s omission from Everton squad,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/10/everton-rafael-benitez-lucas-digne-omission-arsenal
