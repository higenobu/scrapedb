1/22/2022,"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene filed a stock disclosure that she sold up to $15,000 worth of Activision stock on January 18. Microsoft's announced plans to acquire video-game giant Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion on the same day. Activision's stock soared that day, and Greene reported more than $200 in capital gains from the sale. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene filed a stock disclosure indicating she sold up to $15,000 worth of Activision Blizzard stock on January 18 — the day news broke of plans for the video game company to be purchased by Microsoft. Greene reported more than $200 in capital gains on the sale on the disclosure form, which she filed with Thursday with the Clerk of the House of Representatives. It was not immediately clear how much Greene — a freshman Republican from Georgia and one of Congress' most polarizing members — pocketed from the sale. On Tuesday, Microsoft announced plans to acquire video-game giant Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion. If the deal is greenlit, it will be the largest-ever deal in the tech industry. On the same day, Activision's price soared. There is no indication that Greene violated the STOCK Act by making this trade. Greene ranks among Congress' most active stock traders. She was the first member of Congress to invest in Donald Trump's social media company, TRUTH social, and has had no problem investing in companies that espouse social views that clash with her own, such as those on Black Lives Matter. Greene's office could not be reached for immediate comment on the recent sale of Activision Blizzard stock. In September, Greene told Insider, ""I have an independent investment advisor that has full discretionary authority on my accounts. I do not direct any trades."" Greene's stock sale comes in the background of Insider's new investigative reporting project, ""Conflicted Congress,"" which chronicled the myriad ways members of the US House and Senate have eviscerated their own ethical standards, avoided consequences, and blinded Americans to the many moments when lawmakers' personal finances clash with their public duties. The project identified 54 members of Congress who've failed to properly report their financial trades as mandated by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012, also known as the STOCK Act. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat who in December said lawmakers should be allowed to trade individual stocks, reversed course this month, saying she was now open to a stock trading ban for lawmakers. ""If members want to do that, I'm okay with that,"" Pelosi told reporters on Thursday. Microsoft was the No. 2 most popular stock among members of Congress, according to an Insider analysis of congressional financial records. As part of Insider's ""Conflicted Congress"" project, Greene received a ""solid"" rating on the strength of her disclosing her various stock trades on time. Only 10 members of Congress have placed their assets in a ""qualified blind trust"" — a formal, congressionally approved financial vehicle independently managed by a trustee and designed to prevent conflicts of interest. Greene is not among them. Read the original article on Business Insider",Business/INSIDER,"Rep.

1/22/2022,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Two Canadians were killed Friday and one more wounded in a shooting at a hotel along Mexico's Caribbean coast, state authorities said. Quintana Roo state security chief Lucio Hernández said via Twitter that authorities were searching for a Hotel Xcaret guest in the shooting. He shared a photo of a man walking with a handgun. The Xcaret resort is south of Playa del Carmen. Authorities said all three victims were taken to a hospital, but two died. The Quintana Roo state prosecutor's office said via Twitter that the suspect in the shooting was also apparently a guest and Canadian police informed them he was a known felon with a long record related to robbery, drug and weapons offenses. The office said both of the dead also had criminal records. It is just the latest brazen act of violence along Mexico's famed Mayan Riviera, the crown jewel of its tourism industry. In November, a shootout on the beach of Puerto Morelos left two suspected drug dealers dead. Authorities said there were some 15 gunmen from a gang that apparently disputed control of drug sales there. In late October, farther south in the laidback destination of Tulum, two tourists — one a California travel blogger born in India and the other German — were caught in the apparent crossfire of rival drug dealers and killed. Following those events, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador sent nearly 1,500 members of the National Guard to reinforce security in the area.",U.S./Associated Press,"2 Canadians killed, 1 wounded in Mexico resort shooting",https://news.yahoo.com/canadian-tourist-killed-2-wounded-224145533.html
