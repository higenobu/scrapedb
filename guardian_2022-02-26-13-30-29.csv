2/26/2022,"Two people, including a State Emergency Services volunteer, have died after being swept away in floodwaters in Queensland overnight, as some parts of the state experience worse flooding than 2011. It brings the death toll from the floods to four, and two people remain missing. Queensland fire and emergency services commissioner Greg Leach said the volunteer died after the SES vehicle they were travelling in, as part of a crew of four, was swept off the road into floodwaters near Ipswich. “Three of our members were rescued, one of those members is deceased,” Leach said. “We pass on our condolences to family, friends and loved ones.” Leach said it was a “very sad day” for emergency services. The Queensland emergency services minister, Mark Ryan, said SES volunteers routinely put the lives of others before their own. “And this person was doing that last night,” Ryan said. “They were on their way to help people in need. So of course we remember that volunteer, we grieve that volunteer’s loss, but also we pay tribute to their service and their life.” A large piece of concrete pier approximately 40 metres long is floating down the Brisbane River.

State disaster coordinator Steve Gollschewski said the man’s death was still under investigation but there were no suspicious circumstances. “The indications are this person has been caught up in floodwater, but we’ll have to run our investigations,” Gollschewski said. Gollschewski said it was a “dangerous environment”. “In many instances people are still making poor choices about, one, being out and about in this weather, and two, what they do when they’re out there,” he said. He urged people to stay home if they did not need to go out, and not to drive on flooded roads. Flood levels at the Mary River in Gympie had already exceeded levels recorded in the 2011 and 2013 flood disasters, and were headed towards the levels not seen since 1999, when the Mary reached 21.95m. This is Gympie’s town centre this morning. The Mary River is at 20.71 metres and still rising, yet to peak. More rain is on the way for surrounding catchments. @7NewsBrisbane @7NewsWideBay @7NewsSC pic.twitter.com/YeTSDMIrtF The Noosa catchment was expected to reach flood levels not seen since 1992. “It’s clear that we’re in the middle of what could be a season-defining rain event for south-east Queensland,” Bureau of Meteorology senior meteorologist David Grant said. As of Saturday morning, the Bureau of Meteorology had issued six major flood watches for south-east Queensland, including for the lower Brisbane River, the Georgina River, the Logan River, the Mary River, the Upper Brisbane and Stanley Rivers, and the Molloolah, Noosa and Maroochy Rivers in the Noosa catchment. “Since many catchments are now saturated and in combination with this increased rainfall there is now going to be an increased risk of dangerous and life-threatening flash-flooding and even the potential for localised landslides due to how wet these catchments are,” Grant said. Thunderstorms on the Sunshine Coast on Saturday were forecast to bring damaging winds, which combined with the saturated ground could cause trees to fall over. South-east Queensland has received a week of heavy rain, with intense falls on Friday night that was expected to continue though Sunday. Mount Glorious, east of Brisbane, received 618mm in the 21 hours to 9am Saturday while Pomona near Noosa received 535mm and 786mm on Friday. Brisbane received 206mm. It usually records just 150mm for the whole of February. “We’ve essentially had a month’s rain in 24 hours in Brisbane,” Grant said. Grant said the rain system was slowly moving south and could worsen in to Sunday, before easing on Monday or Tuesday. The rain was forecast to move in to northern NSW, where the bureau has already issued flash flooding warnings with forecasts of between 100mm and 250mm falling in some areas of the Mid North Coast and Northern Rivers. An evacuation warning has been issued in the Northern Rivers for residents in low-lying areas of Maclean, where the Clarence River is expected to flood properties and cut off evacuation routes. The Kedron Brook is now the Kedron Torrent. @abcbrisbane pic.twitter.com/DypGoDfEgp In Queensland, the SES received 1,800 calls for assistance overnight and conducted 132 swift water rescues. Some 253 people spent the night in evacuation centres, most of those in Gympie. Gollschewski said police would not hesitate to fine people who drove through closed roads and into flood waters. “If people do the wrong thing deliberately which we still see happening, ignoring signs, driving into water and getting themselves in trouble, but not only putting themselves at risk but putting at risk those that have to go rescue them,” he said. “And as we’ve seen one our colleagues has lost their life trying to help people.

2/26/2022,"On Tuesday, a 7-year-old girl arrived at her Las Vegas elementary school with a stash of sticky notes in her hand, which she gave to her teacher. The notes, from her mother, were a cry for help. The woman wrote that she was being held captive by her boyfriend and feared that her 4-year-old son, who she had not seen for weeks, was dead, according to her attorney. After the teacher notified authorities, police went to the home of Brandon Toseland, where they found the body of Mason Dominguez in Toseland’s freezer. Toseland, 35, has since also been charged with murder and two counts of kidnapping. The woman told her lawyer, Stephen Stubbs, that Toseland sexually, physically and emotionally abused her for months. Toseland isolated her from her family, took away her phone and car keys, controlled her social media accounts and quit her job on her behalf, Stubbs told the Washington Post. He also allegedly installed locks, video surveillance and monitor sensors to track the woman’s movements, Stubbs told the Post. “It just got worse to the point where, finally, in December, there was one day she tried to exit a room and it was locked …and from then on she was held captive.” A statement released by Las Vegas metropolitan police department on Wednesday said the woman was “not allowed to leave the house alone or enter the garage”. In addition, “she also confirmed she had not seen her toddler since December 2021, and she believed he was deceased”. Homicide detectives assumed the investigation and discovered the child’s remains inside a freezer in the garage, the statement said. According to Stubbs, the woman met Toseland through her late husband. After her husband died in January last year, Toseland started to comfort her and the pair began dating two months later. She and her kids went on to move in with Toseland, which “started out fantastic”, Stubbs told Insider. However, from the time that she was locked up to when she was rescued, the woman never had a chance in which she could run away with her daughter. Toseland, who sent the 7-year-old girl to school every morning, would bring along the woman and leave her handcuffed in his car, concealed behind a sun shield. Every day, the woman searched for something to help her escape. She eventually found a stash of sticky notes and a pen. “It was a game of him leaving and her knowing that she has less than a minute to take the sticky notes and the pen from their hiding spot, write whatever she could and then hide it before he could come back … and keep in mind, she can’t even see through the front windshield to know when he’s going to be back,” Stubbs said. Eventually, the woman completed the note and a few days prior to her rescue, Toseland allowed her to sleep in the same room with her daughter. That night, the woman repeatedly coached her daughter on how to deliver the note to her teacher and what to say, according to Stubbs. Police were able to track down Toseland after they set up surveillance around his house and saw him exit the car with the woman. Since her rescue, the woman and her daughter have been staying with relatives and are receiving “all the help they need”, said Stubbs. Scott Coffee, Toseland’s attorney, told the Washington Post that he plans on seeking a mental health evaluation for Toseland and said that it is “too early in the case to know what happened”. “His criminal history is minimal,” Coffee said, referring to the two counts of domestic battery that Toseland has been charged with after being arrested in 2018, to which he pleaded no contest. Toseland is detained in county jail and will appear in court next Monday.",News/US news,A woman’s boyfriend was holding her captive.

2/26/2022,"The past day has focused on the capital, Kyiv. Russian forces entered the outskirts on Friday and were threatening from the north-west and east in an attack aimed at seizing the city. Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned of a difficult night ahead for the capital: “This night will be the hardest,” the Ukrainian president said in an address. “This night the enemy will be using all available means to break our resistance. This night they will launch an assault.” Many Ukrainians are preparing to fight. City authorities have urged residents to stay home but prepare molotov cocktails for a citizen uprising against Russian fighters if they break through defensive lines. In one district they handed out rifles to any citizen who wanted to fight, and the defence ministry has opened the army to any Ukrainian citizen. Explosions have rocked Kyiv, with residents taking cover in shelters and underground stations. A woman has reportedly given birth in one station where she had been sheltering with other residents. The Russian defence ministry claimed its forces had taken control of the strategic Hostomel airfield to the north-west of Kyiv, while Russian tanks were filmed by people in the Obolonskyi district about six miles north of the city centre in the morning. “More than 50,000 Ukrainian refugees have fled their country in less than 48 hours – a majority to Poland and Moldova,” said the UN refugee agency head Filippo Grandi, adding that “many more are moving towards its borders”. Photos have shown enormous queues of cars heading for Ukraine’s western borders. On Friday, guards fired warning shots to prevent a stampede at Kyiv’s central station as thousands of people tried to force their way on to evacuation trains. Vladimir Putin urged the Ukrainian army to overthrow its leadership, whom he labelled as a “gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis who has lodged itself in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people”. The US department of defence has confirmed that a Russian “amphibious assault” has been launched in Mariupol, a coastal city in south-east Ukraine. “Many cities of our state are under attack: Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, our boys and girls in the Donbas, the cities of the south, special attention to Kyiv,” Zelenskiy said. “We can’t lose the capital.” Zelenskiy pleaded for international help and for western powers to act faster to cut off Russia’s economy and provide Ukraine with military assistance. “When bombs fall on Kyiv, it happens in Europe, not just in Ukraine,” he said. “When missiles kill our people, they kill all Europeans.” Prominent Russians have joined protests in Russia or spoken out against the invasion, amid at least 1,800 arrests at anti-war rallies. They include pop stars, chat show hosts and newspaper correspondents who have gone public despite the professional and personal risks that come with dissenting from Vladimir Putin. Nato will deploy significant extra troops to countries in eastern Europe who are part of the alliance, its secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said. UK ministers warned there would be no forces going to Ukraine itself to avoid an “existential” war between Russia and the west. The EU and the UK have moved to freeze foreign-held assets of Putin and his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. The initiative is largely symbolic but followed recognition that appeals for action from Volodymyr Zelenskiy had to be heard. The UN security council voted on a resolution deploring the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Eleven member states voted for the resolution, three abstained (China, India, and UAE), and one voted against (Russia). As Russia holds a veto, the resolution was not upheld. The Council of Europe suspended Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. The 47-nation council announced that Russia was suspended with “immediate effect” from the organisation’s committee of ministers and parliamentary assembly on Friday “as a result of the Russian Federation’s armed attack on Ukraine”. Russia will no longer be allowed to compete in this year’s Eurovision song contest, with organisers saying its inclusion could “bring the competition into disrepute”.",News/World news,Russian forces advance inside Ukraine: what we know so far,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/26/russian-forces-advance-inside-ukraine-what-we-know-so-far
2/26/2022,"Humpback whales have been removed from the threatened species list after a significant increase in numbers in the 60 years since they were first protected, but green groups warn populations could decline again as oceans warm. Global heating is predicted to have a significant impact on krill populations in Antarctica, a major feeding ground for humpback whales. The Australian environment minister, Sussan Ley, said removing the humpback whale from the threatened species list was “a recognition of the success of the outstanding conservation efforts that are in place”. International protections against whaling and domestic protections to preserve the species remain in place, Ley said. The number of humpback whales in Australian waters has grown from just 1,500 at the height of the commercial whaling industry to an estimated 40,000, Ley said. “Australia is a world leader in whale conservation, and we will continue to work through the International Whaling Commission to promote whale conservation and maintain the global moratorium on commercial whaling,” she said. “Our removal of the humpback from the threatened species list is based on science and sends a clear signal about what can be achieved through coordinated action. It is a message of hope for the welfare of a number of species.” Commercial whaling in the southern ocean in the 19th and early 20th century pushed many whale species, particularly the humpback and southern right, to the brink of extinction. More than 30,000 humpback whales were killed by whalers operating in Australia and New Zealand before local whaling operations ceased taking the species in 1963. They received international protection in 1965 in recognition of a dramatic decline in global numbers. The last commercial whaling station in Australia, the Cheynes Beach Whaling Company in Western Australia, closed in 1978 and Australia adopted an anti-whaling policy in 1979. Alexia Wellbelove, a senior campaign manager for Humane Society International, said while whale numbers had shown a “remarkable recovery” in the 60 years they received worldwide protection, the decision to delist the marine mammals “may prove to be short-sighted in the face of looming climate impacts”. “We are so appreciative of the concerted efforts undertaken to recover humpback whale populations, we would hate to see those efforts wasted by jumping the gun and removing the whale’s threatened status,” Wellbelove said. A 2019 study on the impact of historic whaling and future climate change on baleen whales – which includes humpbacks – in the southern ocean said that whole of ecosystem modelling, which linked krill levels to ocean temperature and declining sea ice, predicted “concerning” population declines and even some local extinctions by 2100. Another study in 2020 warned that rapid environmental change caused by the climate crisis appeared to be affecting breeding rates, with a significant decline in the number of humpback whale calves born in a major summer feeding ground for the whales in the northern hemisphere. Whales are also impacted by rising levels of plastics and other pollution in the ocean. They get entangled in fishing gear, swallow plastic, and are affected by ship strikes and noise disturbance. Wellbelove said she hoped to see “ongoing monitoring of humpback whale populations and swift restoration of their threatened status should the data indicate it is required”. Ley said the Australian government was investing in a long-term monitoring program.",News/Environment,Humpback whales removed from Australia’s threatened species list but feeding grounds still at risk,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/26/humpback-whales-removed-from-australias-threatened-species-list-but-feeding-grounds-still-at-risk
2/26/2022,"African countries are being forced to spend billions of dollars a year coping with the effects of the climate crisis, which is diverting potential investment from schools and hospitals and threatens to drive countries into ever deeper poverty. Dealing with extreme weather is costing close to 6% of GDP in Ethiopia alone, equating to a spend of more than $1 repairing climate damage for every $20 of national income, according to research by the thinktank Power Shift Africa. The warning comes just before the major new scientific report from the global authority on climate science, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. This report, the second part of the IPCC’s comprehensive summary of global climate science, will set out the consequences of climate breakdown across the world, looking at the floods, droughts, heatwaves and storms that are affecting food systems, water supplies and infrastructure. As global temperatures have risen in recent decades, and as the impact of extreme weather has become more apparent around the world, efforts to make infrastructure and communities more resilient have largely stalled. Africa will be one of the worst-hit regions, despite having done least to cause the climate crisis. According to the Power Shift Africa study, titled Adapt or Die: An analysis of African climate adaptation strategies, African countries will spend an average of 4% of GDP on adapting to climate breakdown. These countries include some of the world’s poorest people, whose responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions is many times less than those of people in developed countries, or in large emerging economies such as China. Sierra Leone will have to spend $90m a year on adapting to the climate crisis, though its citizens are responsible for about 0.2 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year each, while US citizens generate about 80 times more. Mohamed Adow, director of Power Shift Africa, said: “This report shows the deep injustice of the climate emergency. Some of the poorest countries in the world are having to use scarce resources to adapt to a crisis not of their making. Despite only having tiny carbon footprints compared with those of the rich world, these African countries are suffering from droughts, storms and floods which are putting already stretched public finances under strain and limiting their ability to tackle other problems.” He called for more funding from developed countries, which promised at the Cop26 UN climate summit to double the money available to help poor countries adapt to the climate crisis. Rich countries promised in 2009 to provide $100bn a year to help poor countries cut their greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the effects of climate breakdown. But so far they have fallen short of that target, and most of the funds that have been provided have gone to projects to cut emissions, such as windfarms and solar panels, rather than efforts to help countries adapt. The study examined national adaptation plans submitted to the UN by seven African countries: Ethiopia, Kenya, Liberia, Sierra Leone, South Africa, South Sudan and Togo. South Sudan, which is the world’s second poorest country, was hit by floods last year that displaced 850,000 people, and led to outbreaks of water-borne diseases. The country is to spend $376m a year on adaptation, about 3.1% of its GDP. Chukwumerije Okereke, director of the centre for climate change and development at the Alex Ekwueme Federal University in Nigeria, said rich countries must respond to the findings, and to the IPCC report. “It is both irresponsible and immoral for those that are the chief cause of climate change to look on while Africa, which has contributed next to nothing to climate change, continues to bear a disproportionate share of the impact,” he said. “The time for warm words is long gone. We need urgent, scaled-up, long-term support from the world-leading climate polluters.”",News/Environment,African countries spending billions to cope with climate crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/26/african-countries-spending-billions-to-cope-with-climate-crisis
2/26/2022,"Councils across England are urging householders to set up a direct debit payment for their council tax so that they can automatically receive the government’s £150 energy rebate in April. The payment is designed to help offset some of the huge rise in gas and electricity costs due to take effect the same month and will be paid to those living in properties in council tax bands A-D. About 80% of households qualify for help, but while the money will be paid straight into the bank accounts of those who have a direct debit set up with their local council, anyone paying by any other means will need to make a claim. The Local Government Association said this meant the payments would take longer as councils would need to first contact the households and then make pre-payment checks before giving the rebate. It said in some parts of the country, thousands of households were not set up to receive the payment automatically. Hull city council, for example, has estimated that it does not have bank details for 60,000 households, while Dartford council has reported that 15,000 households do not pay by direct debit. Shaun Davies, the chair of the LGA’s resources board, said: “This year will be tougher than most, particularly for those on lower incomes, so it is good that the government is stepping in to provide financial support to help ease these pressures.” He added: “You can still get the money if you don’t have a direct debit set up, but it could take longer as your council will have to contact you and then you’ll have to make a claim.” Charities have expressed concern that the way the payments will be distributed means those most in need could miss out. When the policy was first announced, Citizens Advice said it was “a complicated lottery that means support is not targeted at people who really need it”, and called on the government to use the benefits system to deliver the money.",Lifestyle/Money,People in England told to pay council tax by direct debit to get £150 rebate,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/26/energy-bills-council-tax-direct-debit-rebate-gas-electricity-prices
2/26/2022,"Australia plans to join its allies in personally sanctioning Vladimir Putin and the Russian foreign affairs minister over the full-scale invasion of Ukraine – but says it will not expel Russian diplomats from the country at this stage. The government flagged the move amid growing fears of an all-out Russian assault on Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and as Russia used its veto power to block a UN security council resolution deploring the invasion. The Australian foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said she was taking advice from her department on expanding sanctions to include the Russian president, who would be “personally responsible for the deaths and the suffering of innocent Ukrainians”. Payne said while sanctioning a country’s leader was an exceptional step, the Russian invasion of Ukraine was “an exceptional situation”. Addressing reporters in Sydney on Saturday, she said Putin had “lied, deceived, fabricated and shown no interest in genuine dialogue”. “Vladimir Putin has unparalleled personal power over his country and he has chosen to go to war against a neighbour that posed no threat to Russia, because he wants to reverse history and take away the freedom and the democracy that the Ukrainian people chose for themselves,” Payne said. “It is clear that the only way to exact a cost for those actions is to ensure that he, himself, shares some of that cost and some of the pain that he is inflicting on everyone else around him in Ukraine.” Payne foreshadowed the action as she noted announcements by the UK, the US, the EU and Canada that they would personally sanction Putin and Russia’s foreign affairs minister, Sergei Lavrov. She was “seeking advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to enable Australia to take similar steps”. Putin and Lavrov were not included when the Australian government announced on Wednesday the first round of sanctions on eight of the 12 permanent members of the Russian security council. Putin chairs that body. On Saturday, Payne said the government would also be imposing sanctions on eight Russian oligarchs who are seen as close to Putin, 339 members of Russia’s parliament “who are the political facilitators of this action”, and key figures in Belarusian government who aided the invasion. Australia’s trade and economic relationship with Russia is very limited, leading some experts to say Australian sanctions are largely symbolic. But Payne on Saturday stressed the importance of the international community showing unity “to ensure that Russia faces a high cost for what is a completely unprovoked and unjustified attack on its neighbour”. The Australian government has been critical of Beijing’s response, including its decision to fully open up to Russian wheat exports, which had previously been subject to health-related restrictions. But Australia’s partner in the Quad grouping, India, has been exploring ways to set up a rupee payment mechanism for trade with Russia to soften the blow on New Delhi of western sanctions, according to a Reuters report. India joined China and the UAE in abstaining from Friday’s vote on the UN security council resolution that criticised Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia was the sole vote against the resolution – in what some observers said was a sign of Moscow’s isolation - but given its veto power was able to block its passage. Asked whether she was concerned about India’s stance and would encourage it to take a stronger position, Payne said every country would “make its own decisions about how it deals with these issues”. Payne said it was Australia’s “clear view that we should call out illegal war and coercion and aggression” and noted India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, had appealed to Putin for immediate cessation of violence. The minister said she had indicated several times that the option of expelling Russian diplomats from Australia remained “a live option”, but it was important to maintain a direct line of communication with the Russian government. “It is not something that we are considering currently,” she said. “It remains an option but not something we are proceeding with at this point.” The head of Dfat has spoken directly with the Russian ambassador, Alexey Pavlovsky, to express Australia’s position. Pavlovsky gave a lengthy press conference last month in which he denied the buildup of Russian troops near the border with Ukraine was a sign of aggression, and said Russia was acting rationally in raising its concerns about the expansion of Nato. Putin had wanted a guarantee that Ukraine would never join Nato. On Friday, the Russian embassy in Canberra defended the military operation to “demilitarise” Ukraine, saying the move was to “defend our country from those who have taken Ukraine hostage and have been trying to use it against Russia and our people”. It has previously said sanctions would have no effect. But both sides of Australian politics have denounced Putin’s actions as an “unprovoked” and “shameful act of aggression” contrary to international law. Amid estimates from the UN refugee agency that 100,000 people have already fled their homes, Payne described the situation in Ukraine as “likely to escalate” and said Australia would be ready to provide humanitarian assistance. Payne confirmed on Saturday that she would meet “in due course” with the new Chinese ambassador to Australia, amid ongoing diplomatic tensions between the two countries and with the federal election looming in May. “I will meet with him and we’ll have discussions,” she said. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, on Friday played down the significance of a gesture from the ambassador, Xiao Qian, who said China and Australia should “meet each other halfway” and “look into the future”. Morrison said the 14 points on the list of grievances issued by the Chinese embassy in 2020 were “not for negotiating”, and it was “completely unacceptable” for China to ease trade restrictions on Russia after the invasion. China’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, hit back at Morrison, saying the Australian government was “entrenched in the Cold War mentality” and had “time and again spread disinformation to smear and criticise China”.",News/Australia news,Australia plans to join allies in personally sanctioning Putin and says expulsion of Russian diplomats a ‘live option’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/26/australia-russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-sergei-lavrov

As the vehicles try to swerve around him, the man jockeys to the side, seemingly in an attempt to block their progress. “Ukrainian rushes under enemy equipment so that the occupiers do not pass,” HB tweeted. ✊🏻Українець кидається під ворожу техніку, щоб окупанти не проїхали pic.twitter.com/cZ29kknqhB The video sparked comparisons to the photo of a man standing down a line of four Chinese tanks in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square.

2/26/2022,"Russian forces have tightened their stranglehold on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv and carried out amphibious assaults on the country’s Sea of Azov coast in an attempt to topple the government. Almost exactly 30 years after the devastating siege of Sarajevo, another major European capital came under heavy bombardment with shells hitting apartment blocks, driving up the civilian death toll. The onslaught of bombing intensified on Friday night, accompanied by artillery rounds and heavy gunfire on the city’s streets. In a bleak statement, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, warned that several cities were under attack. “This night will be the hardest … We must withstand. The night will be very hard, but sunrise will come.” In the hours after he spoke, multiple explosions were reported across the capital amid reports that Russian troops were advancing on the city centre. After the second day of the invasion, it was clear that it was being fiercely resisted, but also that Russia had much more military might yet to be unleashed on its neighbour. Ukrainians prepared a last-ditch defence of their capital, with barricades, and called for civilians to arm themselves with molotov cocktails. According to US estimates, Russia has fired 200 ballistic and cruise missiles at Ukraine, mostly hitting military targets but some landing in residential areas. As human rights groups accused Russia of war crimes, the prosecutor at the International Criminal Court issued a reminder he has jurisdiction to investigate atrocities committed inside Ukraine. US defence officials said that the Russian offensive was facing stiffer resistance than its commanders had anticipated. They had so far not established unchallenged air superiority, for example. But the US estimates that Moscow had only committed a third of the attacking force it had mustered around Ukraine’s borders in recent months. According to the Pentagon, 10 amphibious landing ships unloaded thousands of naval infantry to the west of Mariupol, potentially cutting off the port city. In a televised address marked by more of the extreme rhetoric that has accompanied the invasion, Vladimir Putin described the the government in Kyiv as as “terrorists” and “a gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis”. Earlier in the day, Zelenskiy posted a video of himself and his aides outside the presidential office to counter Russian media rumours that he had fled. “We are here. We are in Kyiv. We are defending Ukraine.” Western intelligence agencies have predicted that Zelenskiy and his top officials could be targeted for assassination as Russia seeks to decapitate the country. “It’s clear the kind of vitriol coming from Russia about the Ukrainian leadership, so I think we can expect that they would be targets for Russian forces coming into the city,” one western official said. Russia was forced to vote alone at the UN security council on Friday night against a resolution deploring its actions. As Russia holds a veto, the resolution was not upheld, but the US and its allies score a small diplomatic victory by persuading China not to vote with Russia but abstain, by slightly watering down the language. They were unable to win over India and the United Arab Emirates, who also abstained. Tremors from the invasion continued to spread around the world on Friday, demonstrating the potential for the already disastrous conflict to spill over Ukraine’s borders. Nato activated its rapid response force which had been established as a contingency in the event of a serious threat on the alliance’s flank. The Kremlin also issued a direct threat to Finland and Sweden, which have been openly contemplating Nato membership as a result of the invasion. “Their accession to Nato can have detrimental consequences … and face military and political consequences,” the foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said. Earlier in the day, barricades went up around the city as its defenders set up positions on bridges prepared for an onslaught, more Russian troops converged on the city from three directions, and Putin urged Ukraine’s military to seize power from the elected government, and bow to his demands to disarm and rule out Nato membership. Streams of people – mostly women and children, since Ukrainian men aged 18-60 are forbidden to leave – crossed into Hungary, Poland and Romania, with 15-hour queues reported at border points. Guards fired warning shots to prevent a stampede at Kyiv’s central station as thousands tried to force their way on to evacuation trains. Ukrainian officials claimed nearly 3,000 Russian servicemen had been killed so far, but warned that advance enemy units had already entered the Obolonskyi district of northern Kyiv. The defence ministry advised residents to “prepare molotov cocktails”. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, said the city had entered “a defensive phase”. He added: “Shots and explosions are ringing out … and saboteurs have already entered Kyiv. The enemy wants to put the capital on its knees and destroy us.” In video footage thought to be from south Ukraine, near Crimea, a Ukrainian civilian was shown standing in front of an advancing Russian military convoy, in scenes reminiscent of Tiananmen Square in 1989, in which a lone Chinese protestor stood in front of a tank, stopping its advance. US officials estimated Russia had launched more than 200 missiles at Ukraine, including both ballistic and cruise weapons. They said most had been aimed at military targets but that some had landed in residential districts, and that it was unclear whether that was accidental or deliberate. The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, issued a reminder that he had the authority to investigate war crimes inside Ukraine and Amnesty International accused the Russian military of “indiscriminate attacks” after investigating several incidents, including a missile strike on a hospital building in Vuhledar in eastern Ukraine, which killed four civilians and wounded 10 more. In another sign of the war’s potential to spin out of control, two more merchant ships were hit by errant missile strikes in the Black Sea, a Japanese bulk carrier and a Moldovan chemical tanker. Zelenskiy earlier on Friday accused Europe of not being hard or quick enough in sanctioning Russia earlier, urging citizens to compel their governments to do more to stop Putin’s invasion. “Europe has enough strength to stop this aggression,” he said. “You have to act swiftly. We demand effective counteraction to the Russian Federation. Sanctions must be further strengthened.” The Ukrainian government continued its appeals to the EU to step up its sanctions, expressing bitter disappointment that the measures taken so far had not included Russia’s exclusion from the Swift global electronic payments system. The German finance ministry said on Friday that it was open to the proposal of including Swift sanctions, while the US, EU and the UK moved to freeze the foreign-held assets of Putin and his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. The US also sanctioned Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, and the chief of the general staff, Valery Gerasimov. The initiative was largely symbolic, as the Russian president is not thought to have identifiable personal wealth abroad. However, the Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, told a Russian TV station Friday night that relations with the west “have reached the line after which the point of no return begins”. In Kyiv, Zelenskiy said in a televised address that Putin was targeting civilian as well as military sites. “They say that civilian objects are not a target for them. It is a lie; they do not distinguish in which areas to operate,” he said, vowing to continue defending his country and criticising world leaders for “watching from afar”. In Russia, thousands of people defied tough anti-protest legislation to stage anti-war rallies across the country on Thursday night. OVD-Info, which monitors arrests at opposition protests, said more than 1,800 people in 59 cities had been detained. Lt Gen Jim Hockenhull, the UK’s head of defence intelligence, released a statement to reporters about the state of the fighting in Ukraine: “Russian forces continue to advance on two axes towards Kyiv. Their objective is to encircle the capital, to secure control of the population and change the regime..”",News/World news,Russian forces tighten hold on Kyiv in attempt to topple government,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/kyiv-attack-latest-russia-invasion-ukraine
2/26/2022,"Up in the posh seats, one extremely astute judge of talent was watching with interest. Chelsea were taking on Al-Hilal in the semi-finals of the Club World Cup and, as far as Arsène Wenger was concerned, the chance to have a close look at Kai Havertz was not to be missed. For those near Wenger at the Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium, it was impossible not to notice how much the former Arsenal manager appreciated Havertz’s game: the elusive movement, the way he kept popping up in unexpected positions, the sense that the Chelsea attacker was always on the verge of producing something special. But it never quite happened for the young German. When he charged down the left and lifted a cross into the area in the 32nd minute, it required a defensive mix-up from Al-Hilal to gift Romelu Lukaku the winning goal. Then, when the former Bayer Leveruksen player tore through midway through the second half, he hit the post when he had the chance to score a magnificent solo goal. It was another one of those nearly moments from Havertz. Sometimes it seems his curse is almost scoring great goals. He can be indulgent with his finishing and for all his elegant movement there are times when he seems reluctant to push the limits, which has stopped him becoming a more dominant figure for Chelsea. Nonetheless the depth of Havertz’s ability is obvious. Wenger glimpsed it from afar and Thomas Tuchel has seen it up close. So, too, have Havertz’s Chelsea teammates. They had faith even when he was struggling to adapt to English football last season. Seasoned players saw in training that Havertz was capable of moments of individual brilliance. Yet he remains a work in progress: a £62m star who finds himself in the weird position of having secured his place in Chelsea’s history, only to find that nobody is quite sure whether he is going to make the most of his vast potential. Havertz’s time at Chelsea has not been spectacular, but it has been special. It is not clear whether he is best as a false nine or a classic No 10. But what do you focus on more? The disappointment of six goals in 44 league appearances or the glory of scoring the winner against Manchester City in last season’s Champions League final? An inability to become a mandatory pick or the nerveless penalty that saw off Palmeiras when Chelsea became world champions for the first time this month? “Two seconds in one year maybe changed the whole year for me,” Havertz says of the Champions League final goal. “Small things can turn everything around. If I had not scored that goal, everyone would say it had been a disaster of a first season for me. I would not say that to myself because I was 21 when I came here and at this age it’s not easy to change everything. It can take one, two or three years to adapt. I think this goal helped me a lot. Now for you guys, for the fans, all in all it was a good first season for me but overall I was not happy.” The positive take is that Havertz, now 22, thrives under pressure. Based on his big-game record, he should be in his element when Chelsea face Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final. Havertz has scored against Jürgen Klopp’s side this season – a clever header in front of the Kop last August – and Chelsea are more fluid and aggressive when he is up front instead of Lukaku, who was dropped against Lille last Tuesday. “I am now at an age where I have to prove it,” Havertz says. “I’m not a talent any more. I played now five years on a good level and I showed in the past that I can score a lot of goals in a season. But I’m a little bit disappointed with my Premier League statistics this year. I want to get better. I know I am not a real No 9. I know I am not just in the box and waiting for the ball for a header. I want to have influence on the game, to have the ball to maybe drop back into the midfield and start the attack.” Havertz took his chance against Lille. He pressed energetically, moved cleverly, linked the play and scored a good goal, so there is little reason for Tuchel to restore Lukaku to the lineup on Sunday. However Havertz’s inconsistency means there are no guarantees he will rise to the occasion. He has not developed the relentlessness of Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah, whose productivity puts Chelsea’s misfiring forwards to shame. This could be a galling experience for the Chelsea hierarchy. They have decent attacking players, but none belong to the elite. There is, as one staff member privately acknowledged this season, nobody in the class of Salah or Manchester City’s Kevin De Bruyne. That, of course, is on Chelsea. “Thanks, José!” was how one figure put it recently, pointing out that Mourinho, during his second spell at Stamford Bridge, sold two players who are now among the Premier League’s best. Salah was 21 when Chelsea signed him from Basel in 2014. The Egyptian was exciting but Mourinho did not take to him or De Bruyne. Both were banished to the sidelines and players from that era remember feeling embarrassed by Mourinho’s treatment of Salah. Chelsea cannot head down that path again. This is the first time they will have faced Salah in a major final and one look at him in a red shirt should be enough to convince them not to let Liverpool profit from their impatience again. Too many expensive forwards are underperforming at Chelsea and it is not a surprise that some have grown unhappy. It is not only about Lukaku, who is probably going nowhere given that he cost £97.5m last summer. Tuchel also has to think about Timo Werner, who would probably benefit from a change of scenery, and there could be another difficult conversation if Christian Pulisic wants to leave. Pulisic, under contract until 2024, could well turn out to be another Salah. The 23-year-old has not lived up to the hype since his £58m move from Borussia Dortmund in 2019 but he is not a lost cause. The American is a dynamic threat when confident and his goal against Lille, who could not handle his speed and directness, was a reminder of what he can do when fully fit. These are complicated times for Chelsea. The summer could bring change but the memory of losing Salah and De Bruyne adds a layer of intrigue to the decision-making process. It is a cautionary tale; one that tells Chelsea it would be wise to give Havertz room to grow. He has not pushed on as expected after his heroics against City last May, but he is heading in the right direction. After all, one of the reasons Chelsea have made it to Wembley is because of Havertz scoring in the semi-final against Tottenham. Maybe Wenger still knows.",Sport/Football,Chelsea need Kai Havertz to start being more than their sometimes man | Jacob Steinberg,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/25/chelsea-kai-havertz-carabao-cup-final-sometimes-man
2/26/2022,"Thomas Tuchel has admitted that he and his players are worried and distracted by the “uncertainty” created by the Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, being named in parliament on Thursday. Tuchel said he was aware that Chelsea could be affected if the UK government targets Abramovich with sanctions after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The manager acknowledged that Chelsea could not ignore that a Labour MP told parliament that Abramovich was identified by the Home Office in 2019 as having links to the Russian state as well as to “corrupt activity and practices”. Telling MPs that he was quoting from a Home Office document leaked to him, Chris Bryant suggested that the UK should seize Abramovich’s assets and bar him from owning Chelsea. Bryant also questioned why nothing more had been done about the 55-year-old’s UK assets given this official verdict. Abramovich has put huge sums into Chelsea since buying the club in 2003 and Tuchel faced questions about the situation before his side face Liverpool in Sunday’s Carabao Cup final. Tuchel said that his mind was “clouded” after the outbreak of war and he was asked about the potential impact on Chelsea employees and supporters if Abramovich were targeted by sanctions. Abramovich has vehemently disputed reports suggesting his alleged closeness to Vladimir Putin and Russia or that he has done anything to merit sanctions being imposed against him. “I am aware of all these scenarios and I am aware of all these discussions at the moment,” Tuchel said. “I would love to take my right not to comment on this until there is a decision made. But we are aware of it and it’s distracting us, it’s worrying us. To a certain degree I can understand the opinions and the critical opinions towards the club, towards us who represent that club. I can understand that and we cannot fully free ourselves from it. “Maybe people understand that me as a coach or the players, we don’t have the insight what is really going on. At the moment we don’t feel responsible for all this. We feel that it is horrible and there can be no doubt about it. War in Europe was unthinkable for me for a long period. The impact is clear and the discussions have an impact. Let’s be a bit more patient and understand what the measurements will be and then we have to maybe deal with it.” In 2018 Abramovich withdrew his application for a new UK investor visa, amid worsening links between the UK and Russia. Abramovich has an Israeli passport and has since travelled to the UK using that. Last November he attended his first Chelsea match at Stamford Bridge in more than three years and he has continued to give the club huge financial backing. Chelsea won the Champions League last season and collected the 21st trophy of the Abramovich era with the Club World Cup this month. But Tuchel accepted that Chelsea could be under a harsher spotlight now and he did not shy away from a question about Abramovich being named in parliament. “You’re right, we should not pretend that this is not an issue and I agree,” Tuchel said. “The situation in general, for me and for my staff and for everybody here at the Cobham, for the players, is horrible. Nobody expected this. “It’s pretty unreal, it’s clouding our minds, it’s clouding excitement towards the final and it brings huge uncertainty. Much more to all people and families who are actually more involved than us. And our best wishes and our regards and thoughts are obviously with them. “Still, there are so many uncertainties around the situation of our club and of the situation in the UK with scenarios like this that it makes no sense if I comment on it. We are aware of it, we have not so much inside information as you think and in the very end, and don’t understand me wrong, I think it’s also derived from the team and from the staff, and I include myself, to be maybe not political. To do do sports and to focus on sports. Not because we are hiding. The situation is clear, it’s horrible, there is no doubt about it.” Tuchel said that he would not try to take his mind off the crisis in Ukraine before the Liverpool game. “I think you can’t,” he said. “I think the situation is too big and it is not an isolated situation somewhere. It concerns Europe, it’s in Europe and we are part of Europe. We cannot say let’s put this to the side. It’s the opposite. We have to live with it right now. There is no running away from it. “There is no shutting the doors and now we focus on football. We are still privileged to live in peace and freedom right here where we are right now. And we are still privileged to have a game of football, to have an emotional but peaceful environment with fans in the stadium.”",Sport/Football,Tuchel admits Chelsea concerned and distracted by Abramovich ‘uncertainty’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/25/tuchel-admits-chelsea-concerned-and-distracted-by-abramovich-uncertainty
2/26/2022,"Everton are expected to silence the air-raid siren that sounds before matches at Goodison Park when Manchester City visit on Saturday out of consideration for the Ukraine internationals Vitalii Mykolenko and Oleksandr Zinchenko. The move comes amid support from several Premier League clubs for players affected by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. West Ham’s manager David Moyes has given the former Ukraine captain Andriy Yarmolenko time off after the attack on his country, with the winger not in the right frame of mind to play against Wolves on Sunday. “He’s not in a very good position at the moment,” Moyes said. “We’ve given him a few days off. We’ll do all we can to help him – it’s a really difficult time for him and his family. I spoke with him yesterday and he was upset, which you can imagine. We just hope his family keep safe.” Two Ukraine internationals could be involved when Everton host the Premier League leaders. The club has sounded an air-raid siren before its traditional Z-Cars theme as a way of galvanising the Goodison crowd in recent seasons but that is likely to be dropped given the situation in Ukraine. Mykolenko, who joined Everton only last month from Dynamo Kyiv, has written on social media about the worry of being unable to help his parents back home. Several Everton supporters’ groups have produced a banner that features the 22-year-old, his country’s colours and the words “We stand with Ukraine” for Saturday’s game. Frank Lampard says a decision on whether to select Mykolenko against City will be down to the player. “I wouldn’t try to force him into a direction,” the Everton manager said. “The decision will be his. The feeling I get is that by coming here and feeling our support in training, it is a small period where his mind is not on other things. That is what it feels like at the minute and I’ll keep tabs on that day by day. “In terms of us as a club, we’re here to support him in any way we can. He just needs to know we are here for him. How we can help with his family, all we can do at this point is support him. He’s been good, training well. Training is a mini-escape in terms of what is going on in his head. In tough moments it can help a young lad in a tough position. I know there are many others in tougher positions but he has been fine.” Zinchenko, who has captained Ukraine, took part in a vigil outside Manchester Central Library on Thursday along with hundreds of his compatriots. Pep Guardiola said: “What would you do if someone attacked the UK? How would you react? How would you feel? It’s what he feels [to protest]. Unfortunately around the world there are many wars – this is a new one. It’s more than a pity because innocent people are dying when these innocent people just want to live in peace. “He is worried. What would we feel if in our country, where we were born and have family and friends, innocent people are being killed? How will you feel? I guess that’s what he feels. Of course, the team and the club is close to him, unconditionally.” The City manager confirmed the 25-year-old was available for the game at Goodison. “Oleks is an incredible, strong guy,” he said. “Of course it’s not easy at the moment but in training yesterday he was brilliant so he’s ready to play in case he has to.” Everton, meanwhile, have appointed Kevin Thelwell as their new director of football. The 48-year-old joins from New York Red Bulls, where he was head of sport, and was previously sporting director at Wolves. He replaces Marcel Brands, who left the relegation-threatened club in December.",Sport/Football,Everton to silence air-raid siren out of respect for Ukraine internationals,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/25/everton-to-silence-air-raid-siren-out-of-respect-for-ukraine-internationals
2/26/2022,"Ralf Rangnick believes Marcus Rashford can draw inspiration from Jadon Sancho as the forward tries to lift himself out of a run of poor form. Rashford started Wednesday’s Champions League last-16 first leg draw at Atlético Madrid but an anonymous display caused him to be replaced on 75 minutes by Anthony Elanga, who scored United’s equaliser. The 24-year-old has only five goals in 22 appearances but Rangnick cited Sancho, who has scored twice and made two assists in his past six games, as an example of another player who struggled previously before enjoying an upturn. “We had a very similar situation as I can remember with Jadon six or seven weeks ago,” the interim manager said. “He is the best example of what can happen. It’s the player himself who has to perform and get the best out of his own performance and this is the same with Marcus.” Rangnick said Rashford is fully fit. “He is definitely not injured,” the German said. “I have personally spoken a lot with him. It’s with him like with all players: when it counts and they are on the pitch – he started against Atlético Madrid – just have to perform. I am pretty sure he is not happy with his performance right now but it doesn’t help if we discuss that every week and talk about our thoughts about what it might be … “Right now he is trying to find his best possible shape and performance, and we just try to give him helping hands with everything we can. We show him video footage, and we speak with him regularly. In training he is in top form – that is why I decided to play him. Now it’s about having that transformation from training to [competitive games] and this is the next step he has to take.” Rangnick indicated he is content for Rashford and Sancho, who are predominantly wide players, to operate on either wing. “Marcus has played on the right [as well as left] and I remember in the game against Arsenal the last game when Michael Carrick [as caretaker] was in charge he did well in that game so for me it’s not a question of who plays left or right.”",Sport/Football,Ralf Rangnick urges Marcus Rashford to draw inspiration from Jadon Sancho,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/25/ralf-rangnick-urges-marcus-rashford-jadon-sancho-manchester-united
2/26/2022,"Antonio Conte has promised to continue delivering home truths at Tottenham, no matter how brutal, as he suggested his explosive outburst after Wednesday’s defeat at Burnley was merely a sign of how much he cares. The manager offered another one on Friday when he admitted the club was in a much worse state than he had imagined when he joined last November. “Maybe in my heart, in my mind and my head I thought to find a situation not better but more ready to fight and to win,” Conte said, as he prepared for Saturday’s Premier League game at Leeds. “Instead I found a situation where we have to work a lot, much more than was my expectation to do. “But I am not scared about the work. Only through work have I reached an important level in my career. When I arrived here, I did not ask anything. But at the same time, I know that if I arrive here, they know they are taking an important coach, not a medium coach.” Conte was overcome by rage after Burnley, which was a fourth league defeat in five matches, with resignation about the club’s situation prominent among his emotions. He said that he could not go on like his, adding “maybe I’m not the right guy”, sparking fears he might quit. The Italian eased them as he looked ahead to Leeds but there was no rowing back on his combative style, nor will there be. Conte, who has regularly shone a harsh light on the squad’s shortcomings, was asked whether his outbursts risked destabilising the players and club. The gist of his answer was that if they did, the players were no good to him anyway. “If you tell the truth, you destabilise?” Conte said. “In my opinion and in my education … my family said to me: ‘With the truth, you grow. With a lie you destabilise people.’ If I destabilise someone, [he is] not good man, [it is] not a good club. I want a strong club, strong men, strong players. The truth is the only way that I know to grow.” Conte said his problem was that he is a “perfectionist” and so when results slip his reaction will always be the same. He can only be himself. “When you lose a game, I’m not the person to have dinner with,” he said. “My mood is very bad. I prefer to stay alone … to live the defeat, metabolise the defeat. For sure, I need one day to recover – at least. There are many coaches that don’t suffer. Sometimes I envy them. “When I lose, if you expect me to come to a press conference and laugh … I am not this person. I am sorry if I show my disappointment because maybe it would be good to keep this inside and not show my emotion. But it is difficult for me to lie or hide the truth. I am a person who hates to lose and maybe in this club not many are used to having this type of person. “I’m enjoying my time in Tottenham and especially when I show disappointment after a defeat, it means I feel commitment for the club. Others can think: ‘We win, tomorrow we lose, one day [we] have to go’ … and he doesn’t care. No. I want to leave something important for this club.” Conte said he had spoken to the chairman, Daniel Levy, after the Burnley game and that they understood each other. Asked whether he could guarantee he would stay until the end of the season, Conte said: “In this moment, I guarantee the best commitment I can give to the club. I have another season of contract but you know very well that football is strange. You can have three, four years of contract and the club can sack you. Sometimes, someone decides to go away. “You know that football changes quickly. But in this moment, I repeat, I am totally committed to Tottenham and I have a good relationship with the club, especially with Daniel. He knows very well what are my thoughts for the present and what is my vision. Everything. It is best to have a direct way with the owner. It is OK.”",Sport/Football,Antonio Conte vows to continue telling home truths at Tottenham,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/25/antonio-conte-vows-to-continue-telling-home-truths-at-tottenham
2/26/2022,"There have perhaps never been greater differences surrounding the circumstances surrounding one manager’s last game in his old job, and the first game in his new one. Three years ago, Mark Hughes’s tenure as Southampton manager came to an end with a 2-2 draw against a Manchester United side managed by José Mourinho which featured Paul Pogba, Romelu Lukaku and Marcus Rashford. This Saturday, it is Mansfield Town and players such as Lucas Akins and Jordan Bowery who stand in Hughes’s way for his match as manager of League Two side Bradford City. The challenges are different too. Back then, Hughes was fighting to keep Southampton in the Premier League and retain his record of having never managed outside the top flight. That record officially disappears when he takes charge of Bradford, who are 15th and 10 points adrift of the play-offs. It is one of the more remarkable appointments in recent memory. But while so much is different about the circumstances Hughes will walk into at Valley Parade on Saturday, he insists one thing remains the same. “I’ll still have that same excitement about this match as I did with the last one,” he says. “It will absolutely be no different to managing in the Premier League in that regard. The build to a game is great, being on the grass and training, but by far the best thing is the matchday itself. It’s turning up there, seeing the crowd build and it’s the thing I’ve missed the most, without a shadow of a doubt.” With around 15,000 spectators expected on Saturday, including a large travelling contingent from Mansfield, the 58-year-old is being given a soft opening, of sorts, to life in the lower leagues. Having spent three years out of coaching, there will be keen interest in Hughes to see how he adjusts to not only his return, but his first experience of a new level with a group of players that are complete unknowns to him. For Hughes though, this is a chance to make a significant impact at a club which has sacked seven managers in the last four seasons alone. “It’s happened very quickly, but all the information is out there and anything I need to know about Bradford and I can find out very quickly,” he says. “It’s a club I would like to put my mark on in terms of driving them forward from the low ebb they are at right now.” The big question though is: why Bradford? “There were opportunities to return elsewhere but some of them coincided with Covid restrictions and I found it very difficult to get enthused about football behind closed doors,” Hughes says. “That maybe shaped my view on a couple of opportunities but this is good timing. “It’s a good opportunity and I get a chance to look at the players I’ve got and the structure of the club and look at maybe what’s desperately needed to push it forward.” There is so much mystery and intrigue surrounding this move, nobody is quite sure what to expect, least of all Hughes, who will be exposed to away trips at places like Forest Green and Sutton United before the end of the season. But the one thing you can guarantee is this will be a story well worth following. With Bradford so far adrift of the League Two play-offs, it is not unthinkable he will still be managing in the fourth tier next season. “That doesn’t faze me at all,” Hughes says. “There will be a period of adjustment but it’s up to me to make that as short and sharp as possible. I’m excited for the challenge.” You wonder if Hughes will feel the same come 5pm on Saturday evening.",Sport/Football,Manchester United to Mansfield: Mark Hughes relishing Bradford bow,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/25/manchester-united-to-mansfield-mark-hughes-relishing-bradford-bow
2/26/2022,"San Francisco’s troubled Millennium Tower, which has continued to sink despite multimillion dollar efforts to correct it, has developed yet another problem. The luxury tower, popular among star athletes and retired Google employees before the tilting issues were widely publicized, has sunk 18in since its construction was completed in 2009 and has a 26in tilt at the top. Now, the engineer overseeing the retrofit of the tower has said the movement caused the formation of a one-inch gap between the building and a smaller 12-story adjacent structure. “Given the present westward tilt of the building, about 24 inches as measured at the roof, the gap between the two buildings in the east-west direction has widened by about 1 inch[2.5cm],” the project engineer, Ron Hamburger, said in a statement to NBC Bay Area. The Millennium Tower uses an underground parking garage housed within the smaller structure. Despite the gap, engineers “determined that the building is not at risk due to this movement, or any movement likely to occur before construction completion”, Hamburger said, and the gap is not expected to worsen. He has previously warned that the tower’s elevators and plumbing may no longer work if sinking continues at its current rate. Engineers are working on a retrofit of the building and plan to install 18 steel piles to bedrock, relieving pressure on the foundation, to stop further tilting and sinking as well as possibly reverse some of the movement. “Once the voluntary upgrade is complete, further settlement of the building at the northwest corner will be arrested, some rebound will occur, and slight additional settlement of the rest of the main tower will act to reverse the tilting that has occurred and close the gap between the elevator thresholds in the adjacent podium building that connects the main tower and mid-rise together,” Hamburger told the San Francisco Chronicle. Previous efforts to reinforce the foundation of the downtown tower came to a halt last summer, when engineers found the building had sunk an inch in the months since the attempted repairs started.",News/US news,An inch apart: new troubles for San Francisco’s Millennium Tower,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/25/inch-san-francisco-millennium-tower
2/26/2022,"With his team huddled around him in the dressing room of Cardiff’s National Stadium, Wales’ captain Phil Bennett delivered a speech that has gone down in rugby folklore. Stoking the fires of Welsh pride and pressing the pressure point of national insecurity, he called on his fellow patriots to perform their civic duty and teach their better resourced neighbours a lesson. This rousing call worked. With their blood sufficiently heated, Wales won the match – contested on 5 March 1977 – 14-9. On Saturday, another captain wearing a red jersey with 10 on his back will be tasked with motivating his charges before facing their fiercest foes. “Sometimes very little is needed to be said,” said Dan Biggar, downplaying the importance of a pre-planned speech. “It’s very much down to the individual. I’d like to think that in a pivotal weekend in the Six Nations against England at Twickenham there won’t be too much needed said from an emotional level to get us going.” Biggar, who lives in England and plays club rugby with Northampton, was cautious about using the same belligerent language as his predecessor Bennett. Even though he sought to dampen the jingoism he conceded that this game is one that Welsh fans most look forward to when the fixtures are released. For them, the significance of beating England transcends log positions and the context of the Six Nations Championship. But beating England and beating England at Twickenham are two different prospects. Wales have not won there since the momentous 2015 World Cup group match when Biggar’s late penalty was the difference. In four of their five subsequent defeats, a worrying pattern has emerged. In the 2016 Six Nations, Antony Watson’s 30th-minute converted try opened a 16-0 lead for England. In 2018 all 12 of England’s points were scored by the 20th minute with Wales only managing six from the remaining hour. In a World Cup warm-up match in 2019 England scored 14 unanswered points in as many minutes. In the 2020 Championship, Watson’s fourth minute try meant Wales were chasing the game before their heart rates were up. When Bundee Aki dotted down after just three minutes in the 29-7 defeat in Dublin, Wales’ leadership group began to wonder if this was a systemic problem within the camp. To their credit, Biggar’s team rallied and beat a more fancied Scottish outfit a week later. Both the captain and his coach Wayne Pivac have credited a frothing Principality crowd for lifting their performance but Biggar insists that the onus is on them to rise for the occasion no matter the venue. “We need to make sure that when we go away to tough places, like the Aviva, like Twickenham, we start well,” Biggar said. “It’s important we don’t give them a start. It’s such a difficult task. Even if you get yourself back in the game, one more score for England takes you out. They’ve got some serious strength in depth and they’re a very good side.” England’s selection of Harry Randall at scrum-half has not gone unnoticed and Biggar believes this is a clear warning that Eddie Jones intends on playing a high tempo game. Not that Wales will mind that. They too will be looking to keep the ball in hand. When Biggar is in possession and is forced to kick he will more often than not look to avoid touch, starving England’s powerful maul the opportunity to rumble up field. The reintroduction of Taulupe Faletau, playing his first Test in six months after sustaining an ankle injury with the British and Irish Lions in South Africa, will encourage Wales’ attacking strategy. “Toby is world class,” his skipper said. “It’s great to have him back. To have a bit more muscle but also that ball playing ability that he brings.” Manu Tuilagi’s injury doesn’t swing the pendulum entirely in Wales’ favour but his absence will further embolden the visitors who must now feel that they’re closer to parity in the collision. But this is an area of the game that isn’t necessarily won by the bigger or faster man. Character counts as much stature. “At some point you have to roll your sleeves up,” Biggar said, referencing the spirit his team showed in 2015 to overturn a 19-9 deficit. “Gethin Jenkins spoke really well at half-time [against Scotland]. He asked what sort of feeling do we want in the dressing room when we come back in. Do we want to be enjoying a beer after putting everything in and enjoying the result? Or do we want to feel that we haven’t given it our all and are really quite disappointed with how we played and let the country down?” Biggar may try to convince you that this is just another rugby match. Don’t believe a word of it.",Sport/Sport,‘You have to roll your sleeves up’: Biggar says character counts against England,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/25/wales-england-six-nations-dan-biggar-twickenham
2/26/2022,"If part of the joy of the Six Nations is the glorious unpredictability of it all, for France there is an uneasy sense of déjà vu about what lies ahead at Murrayfield on Saturday afternoon. Les Bleus lorded it over Scotland with only one defeat in the first 16 years of the expanded Championship, but 2016 proved something of a watershed in relations for the Auld Alliance, with the Scots having won four of the last six tournament encounters, including the last three in Edinburgh. Recent history has not stopped thousands of buoyant French supporters descending on the Scottish capital after opening victories over Italy and Ireland, but there are reasons for caution in Tricolore ranks. Gregor Townsend’s side derailed the last French grand slam bandwagon two years ago, and memories of Scotland’s stunning 27-23 triumph in Paris at the end of last year’s championship are still painfully fresh. A third successive Championship victory over the French for the first time since 1958 would reignite hopes of a top-two finish for Stuart Hogg and company, with Italy in Rome next and the prospect of heading to Dublin on the final day with an outside shot at the title themselves. So much for the tartan-tinted view. The pessimists argue, with some justification, that the Scots’ defeat in Cardiff a fortnight ago exposed a familiar failing when burdened with heightened expectations. Then factor in that the French appear to have kicked on apace over the past year, adding greater power, defensive resolve, speed and consistency to their game to the extent that Townsend rates them as “arguably the best team in the world” on current form. There remains an intriguing psychological dynamic to this fixture, though. France may have blown New Zealand away last autumn and bludgeoned a confident Ireland to defeat last time out, but they have not found the Scots to be so accommodating when something tangible is on the line. In 2020 France lost fly-half Romain Ntamack to an early injury, flanker François Cros to a yellow card and had prop Mohamed Haouas sent off for a swinging punch at Jamie Ritchie all before half-time. Scotland ruthlessly exploited their numerical advantage to inflict the heaviest defeat – 28-17 – of Fabien Galthié’s reign at a raucous Murrayfield. “They are a team who pose us problems and we are aware of the level we need to be at in all areas to compete,” said the head coach. “Murrayfield is always extraordinary but we learned a lot from that match. We have prepared ourselves accordingly – physically, tactically and psychologically.” The visitors have the stardust of Antoine Dupont and Ntamack to sprinkle on proceedings but they also have their fair share of brute force inside and outside their half-back duo for a match Galthié believes will be decided by “physical domination”. The formidably strong Jonathan Danty is back at centre alongside Gaël Fickou and Galthié has moved Yoram Moefana from midfield to replace the injured Gabin Villière on the wing, ostensibly to counteract Scotland’s “very fast, very powerful” three-quarters, notably wings Darcy Graham and Duhan van der Merwe who Galthié believes are “walking on water at the moment”. Scotland have scored a couple of tasty multi-phase tries against England and Wales but their attack has only spluttered fitfully so far. With a dry forecast, Hogg believes that could change. “Hopefully if we get the pictures we have seen from the French defence, there are huge opportunities for us with ball in hand,” he said. “I have no doubt if we carry hard, move them around and find space, our attack will really get going.” Scotland Hogg (capt); Graham, Harris, Tuipulotu, Van der Merwe; Russell, Price; Schoeman, McInally, Z Fagerson, Skinner, Gilchrist, Haining, Darge, BradburyReplacements Turner, Kebble, Nel, Hodgson, Christie, White, Kinghorn, Bennett France Jaminet; Penaud, Fickou, Danty, Moefana; Ntamack, Dupont; Baille, Marchand, Atonio, Woki, Willemse, Cros, Jelonch, AlldrittReplacements Mauvaka, Gros, Bamba, Taofifenua, Flament, Cretin, Lucu, Ramos - Key to that vision, as always, will be Finn Russell, who Hogg praised for the “outstanding” analysis he has provided on opponents he plays with and against in the Top 14 for Racing 92. “Finn has been absolute quality and is getting really excited about the opportunities in attack and driving the way we want to play,” Hogg said. “I’ve no doubt he will execute everything he wants to do to get us moving forward.” Scotland’s back-row resources have been further depleted with Matt Fagerson joining Jamie Ritchie on the sidelines and Sam Skinner switching to lock. Townsend was dealt a further blow on Friday evening when flanker Hamish Watson was forced out of the starting XV after testing positive for Covid. That, in turn, has led to Edinburgh’s Nick Haining coming in to the team to play on the blindside, with Rory Darge moving to openside flanker. Saracens’ Andy Christie also comes into the matchday squad and the 22-year-old would make what would be his Scotland debut were he to be called on to feature from the replacements. Two members of the Scotland backroom team have also tested positive for Covid and will isolate as per Scottish government guidelines. The Scots, as Skinner noted this week, are in “do or die” mode. If the French have the heavy artillery and genius of Dupont to prevail in a tight contest, it would not be a major surprise if the hosts live to fight another day in their quest to become Championship contenders.

2/26/2022,"England have insisted that Manu Tuilagi was “managed appropriately” on his return to the national setup despite being ruled out of Saturday’s Six Nations clash against Wales with a hamstring injury. Tuilagi sustained the new injury – a low grade hamstring tear – in training on Thursday just hours after he had been named to make his first Six Nations start in two years. In November Tuilagi suffered an injury to the same hamstring in the act of scoring the opening try in the thrilling autumn victory over South Africa. The 30-year-old made his comeback off the bench for Sale against Harlequins in early February with an impressive 29-minute cameo, after which the Sharks director of rugby, Alex Sanderson, said he would prefer Tuilagi had a couple more games at the club to build up his match fitness. He played 52 minutes the following weekend – scoring a try against Worcester – before joining up with England at the start of last week. “Both strength and conditioning and medical teams liaise closely about all players, all players are managed appropriately with what is required, that is no different for Manu’s situation than any other player,” said England’s forwards coach, Richard Cockerill. “[There’s] disappointment for him, he has worked very hard on his conditioning, he is in really good shape, the shape of his life. These little niggles are frustrating but he is a good man, he has matured and he has a good outlook on life.” England are confident that Tuilagi will be back playing before the end of the Six Nations and believe they can keep their championship title bid on track without him against Wales. Eddie Jones was not due to confirm who will replace Tuilagi in the starting lineup until England arrive at Twickenham on Saturday with Henry Slade expected to move to inside-centre and Elliot Daly or Joe Marchant coming in to the No 13 jersey. Cockerill added: “I am sure he will come back as good as ever. He works very hard at his game but that is the game sometimes, you get injuries, you work through them and he has worked through a fair few injuries in his career. I have no doubt he will come back and be fresh and playing well for club and country very soon. “If we want to have any opportunity to win the championship we need to win all three games. That starts against Wales. It’s an important game for Wales and ourselves. We know we have to win and to win we will have to play very well. Wales clearly have a lot of very good players, they work very hard for each other and if you give them an opportunity they will take it. “We are treating them with huge respect. We know they will bring their A game to Twickenham and we’ve got to do the same.”",Sport/Sport,England say Manu Tuilagi was ‘managed appropriately’ despite injury setback,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/25/england-say-manu-tuilagi-was-managed-appropriately-despite-injury-setback
2/26/2022,"If a mini mid-winter revival under Dean Smith offered Norwich City faint hope, this defeat saw them revert to type. On this evidence, the remainder of the season promises to be a slog and it would have been a travesty had Southampton only came away with a slender victory. Just as it seemed Ralph Hasenhüttl’s side would have to settle for what would have been tantamount to a one-nil battering, the midfielder Oriol Romeu smacked in a wonderful effort from the edge of the box with a couple of minutes to spare, building on Che Adams’s first-half strike. Southampton, who have lost just once at home all season, are keeping good company in the top half. The home support were able to afford a communal chuckle at the slapstick manner of Adams’s 36th-minute opener but it made painful viewing from a Norwich perspective. Brandon Williams, who struggled at left-back, made a sliding intervention but inadvertently gifted the ball to the swarming Tino Livramento and the teenager sent a low cross into the six-yard box. Angus Gunn, the Norwich goalkeeper whose last Premier League game at this ground was for Southampton in the infamous 9-0 defeat to Leicester, skewered the ball with his right boot and it bounced off Max Aarons and to Adams. The Southampton striker made a mess of applying the finishing touch, swiping at thin air the first time around before finally scooping the ball over the line and setting off towards the corner in celebration. By then, Gunn had repelled a Mohamed Elyounoussi volley and a deflected strike by the superb Stuart Armstrong as Southampton peppered the Norwich goal. Hasenhüttl once compared the Scotland striker Adams’s previous struggles in front of goal to the all-or-nothing nature of shaking ketchup out of a bottle but this scruffy strike from close range against feeble opponents represented a ninth goal in 16 games for club and country. “It felt a tough night,” Smith said. “I thought Southampton played at a high level and we had too many six out of 10s and if you have that you’re not going to compete in the Premier League. We weren’t aggressive enough without the ball and certainly not good enough with it. Teemu [Pukki] was isolated but he is going to be when you cannot string three or four passes together.” Smith stewed in the away technical area. Williams found the going tough against the roaming Livramento and the full-back presented the voracious Armando Broja with a sight of goal after overcooking a simple pass into Mathias Normann, but the striker’s shot dribbled at Gunn. Josh Sargent had a shot blocked after Pukki expertly turned Jan Bednarek before Billy Gilmour dropped the rebound wide but Norwich, who have lost nine of their past 12 league matches, did not offer anything to suggest they are going to wriggle clear of relegation. “We have to put it into context but the players know they have to be better than they were,” Smith said. “I don’t believe it was a backwards step in terms of the mentality and belief. We just didn’t play at a good enough level.” Southampton have now lost just one of their past 12 matches. Pukki enjoyed the odd foray upfield – Kenny McLean skied a shot after the striker cut the ball back to the edge of the box – but he was a one-man band and his frustration caught up with him when he tugged at Livramento’s shirt. On the opposite flank Norwich could not live with the again brilliant Kyle Walker-Peters. It seemed a matter of when and not if a dominant Southampton would double their advantage. Gunn kept out another Armstrong shot, and a volley by Walker-Peters with 20 minutes to play. Armstrong then flashed another shot wide. Gunn looked at the yellow shirts before him aghast. Southampton were stupidly comfortable and when Norwich did locate the ineffective Milot Rashica with an incisive through pass Mohammed Salisu switched on the afterburners to steal the ball. Norwich roused now and then – Salisu stood his ground when Pukki swivelled neatly in the box with 15 minutes to play and Grant Hanley glanced wide unmarked to Smith’s pain – but with the final whistle approaching Romeu leathered in emphatically from the edge of the box. Depeche Mode’s Just Can’t Get Enough blared at the final whistle, a fitting soundtrack for the Saints who march on. “We knew these are the toughest wins because everybody expects it, against a team who are super organised and fighting for everything,” Hasenhüttl said. “A fantastic shot by Ori calmed the game down. The crowd is fully believing in us.”",Sport/Football,Romeu screamer puts seal on Southampton’s defeat of Norwich,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/25/southampton-norwich-premier-league-match-report
2/26/2022,"A Memphis judge ordered a new trial for Pamela Moses, a woman who was sentenced to six years in prison for trying to register to vote. The case attracted national attention in recent weeks, following a Guardian report, because of the severity of the sentence. Moses said she had no idea she was ineligible. Moses has been in prison since December, when her bond was revoked. On Thursday, the Guardian revealed new evidence in the case that had not been produced at the trial. Moses was being released from custody on Friday, according to Claiborne Ferguson, her attorney. “We are so excited that the motion for new trial was granted for Pamela Moses today and that she is able to return home to her family while she awaits trial. We hope that she receives justice and is found not guilty for the admitted mistakes of the state of Tennessee,” said Dawn Harrington, the executive director of Free Hearts, a criminal justice organization in Tennessee that supported Moses. Moses was convicted last year for submitting a document in 2019 indicating she was eligible to vote. Prosecutors said she knew that this was false, because just months before a judge issued an order telling Moses she was still on probation for a 2015 felony. In Tennessee, people on felony probation cannot vote. When she turned in the form, Moses believed that the probation for her 2015 felony had expired, and a probation officer even signed a certificate indicating that this was the case and that she was eligible. Prosecutors said that Moses deceived the officer into signing the certificate. But evidence obtained by the Guardian this week showed that corrections officials investigated the error immediately afterwards and determined that the probation officer – identified as Manager Billington – was negligent and made an error while Moses waited in the lobby of his office. “Manager Billington advised that he thought he did due diligence in making his decision,” Joe Williams, an administrator in the department of corrections, wrote in an email to Lisa Helton, a top department official. “Manager Billington failed to adequately investigate the status of this case. He failed to review all of the official documents available through the Shelby county justice portal”. Ferguson, Moses’ attorney, said he had never seen the document before the Guardian showed it to him on Wednesday. W Mark Ward, the judge who oversaw the case and sentenced Moses, cited the prosecution’s failure to disclose the letter, even if it was inadvertent, as one of the reasons he was ordering a new trial. “The document does contain information that was not addressed in the direct and cross-examinations of Billington and contained the identity of an additional possible witness for the defense.” Ward also said the court had erroneously allowed information about a prior 2000 felony conviction and an earlier effort by Moses to get her voting rights back to be introduced at trial. “The only real issue for the jury during the trial was whether the defendant knew the certificate of voting rights restoration form was not accurate when she obtained it and utilized it to attempt to register to vote,” he wrote. “The fact that she was convicted of a felony in 2000 and had her right to vote restored in 2014 has no significant relevance” to the case at hand. The ruling was an abrupt reversal for Ward, who yelled at Moses’ lawyer during the sentencing hearing and said she tricked the probation officer. “This ruling is an extraordinary development. It is very rare for a judge to reverse himself like this, and it’s telling that he sentenced her so severely and summarily discounted her position before the case made national news,” said Josh Spickler, the executive director of Just City, a criminal justice non-profit. The district attorney’s office, he said, “has long had a reputation for failing to disclose material evidence that could benefit the accused. This is yet another shocking example of that”. Amy Weirich, the district attorney, defended her office’s handling of evidence in the case. “The Tennessee department of correction failed to turn over a necessary document in the case of Pamela Moses and therefore her conviction has been overturned by the judge,” Weirich said in a statement. “When reporters or political opportunists use the word ‘state’ they need to be crystal clear that the error was made by the TDOC and not any attorney or officer in the office of the Shelby county district attorney.” Prosecutors can now decide to appeal Ward’s order, retry the case, or drop the charges. Larry Buser, a Weirich spokesman, did not immediately return a request for comment on next steps for prosecutors.

2/26/2022,"Two years ago exactly, Joe Biden stood on a debate stage in Charleston, South Carolina, his candidacy on the ropes, and made a promise: if elected president, he would nominate the first Black woman to the supreme court. Days later, Biden won the South Carolina primary on the strength of his support among Black voters. The victory propelled him to the Democratic nomination and then to the presidency. Last month, Justice Stephen Breyer announced his retirement, presenting Biden with an opportunity to fulfill that campaign commitment. On Friday, Biden stood before a podium in the White House’s Cross Hall to nominate Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to supreme court, declaring that the highest court in the land should reflect “the full talent and greatness of our nation”. If eventually confirmed by the senate, she will be the first Black woman to serve on the supreme court in its 232-year history. It was a rare moment of celebration for Biden, embattled on nearly every front. His once hugely ambitious domestic agenda is stalled, perhaps permanently; the Democrats’ tenuous control of Congress faces historic headwinds in this year’s midterm elections; and the international order that Biden spent much of his political career defending faces its gravest threat in decades after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But the nomination of a supreme court justice is one of the most enduring acts of any president’s legacy. And for Biden, it is particularly resonant. Biden has said that he hopes the diversity he has brought to the federal government will be long-lasting. After serving as the vice-president to the nation’s first Black president, he chose Kamala Harris to be his running mate, which led her to become the first Black and Asian American woman to serve as vice-president. His cabinet is the most diverse in US history. And in his first year, Biden nominated a record number of district and appeals court judges from a range of racial, ethnic, geographical and legal backgrounds. Black voters, and Black women especially, were the driving force behind Biden’s nomination and his presidency. According to exit polls in 2020, Black women were his most loyal supporters, with 90% casting their ballots for him. In January 2021, Black female organizers in Georgia helped Democrats win two Senate runoff elections, cementing the party’s control of the chamber and delivering to Biden narrow but meaningful congressional majorities. Yet Biden has failed to enact much of his racial justice agenda. Democrats failed to overcome a Republican filibuster of voting rights legislation, designed to combat the raft of restrictive voting laws being enacted by conservative legislatures across the country. Attempts at policing reform sputtered last year, while the economic provisions of his Build Back Better agenda intended to combat soaring income inequality remain stalled in the Senate amid opposition from his own party. In that sense, Jackson’s nomination is a rare opportunity for Biden to make good on a promise to Black women. Democrats alone could confirm Jackson to the supreme court, with Harris breaking the tie. When Jackson was confirmed to the appeals court last year, she won the support of three Republican senators. But one of them, Senator Lindsey Graham, already criticized her nomination, saying it was a sign that the “radical left has won President Biden over yet again”. But for many, and especially for Black women, Jackson’s nomination, at the end of Black History Month, was a moment of vindication and pride. “She is eminently qualified to serve our nation on our highest court,” said Harris, a former federal prosecutor. “And while she will be the first Black woman on the supreme court, Judge Jackson will not be the last.” Barack Obama, who nominated Jackson to serve as a district court judge in Washington DC, said the judge had “already inspired young Black women like my daughters to set their sights higher and her confirmation will help them believe they can be anything they want to be”. In a statement announcing his decision to nominate Jackson, Biden recalled a formative exchange between a teenage Jackson and her high school guidance counselor. When Jackson, the daughter of public school teachers whose parents grew up in the segregated south, told her counselor that she wanted to attend Harvard, the counselor warned her that she should not set her expectations “so high”. “That didn’t stop Judge Jackson,” Biden said. Jackson graduated at the top of her class from Harvard College, then attended Harvard Law School, where she excelled as an editor of the Harvard Law Review. Now, she is poised to make history as a supreme court justice.",News/US news,Ketanji Brown Jackson’s nomination is rare moment of celebration for Biden,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/25/ketanji-brown-jackson-nomination-biden-analysis

2/26/2022,"Concerns are mounting about the safety of Ukraine’s 15 nuclear reactors and the possibility of an ecological disaster in the midst of the Russian invasion. Experts said that those reactors, at four power plants around the country, had layers of safeguards to prevent a catastrophic meltdown of their cores, but in a full scale war of the kind Vladimir Putin has unleashed, there was a heightened risk of those safety layers all failing at once. Radiation spikes were reported on Friday from Chernobyl, the site of the 1986 nuclear disaster which has been overrun by Russian forces. The remains of the reactor core are buried under concrete and the plant is also a storage facility for spent nuclear fuel. The Ukrainian ambassador to Washington Oksana Markarova said that responsibility for the plant, spelt Chornobyl in Ukrainian, now rested with Russia as strict regulations for the plant were not being observed. She accused the Russian forces of holding 92 plant personnel as hostages. Ukraine’s regulatory authority attributed the radiation spikes to military vehicles churning up top soil that is still contaminated by the 1986 reactor explosion. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said the readings from Chernobyl remained low and did not pose a danger to the public, but added that the agency was closely monitoring Ukraine’s reactors. It said the IAEA director general, Rafael Grossi “remained gravely concerned”. Six of Ukraine’s reactors are at a nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhia, the second biggest in Europe, which is close to where the Russians deployed thousands of troops in amphibious landings on Friday. Up to now the Ukrainian nuclear regulator had assured the IAEA that all its reactors were working safely. However, the Russian advance from the south was fast approaching the area. While a direct strike on the plant remains a remote possibility, experts warn that a disaster could be caused if staff were abruptly prevented from reaching the facility or if there was a sustained interruption in the power supply required to keep the fuel rods continuously cooled. Nuclear power plants use diesel generators as a backup, but those rely on the supply of fuel, which could be severely limited in the midst of a war. “There are contingencies but I doubt that these power plants have prepared for a full-scale invasion,” said Mariana Budjeryn, a Ukrainian research associate with Harvard University’s project on managing the atom. “In the middle of a large scale conflict, there’s a myriad of things that could happen, for which normal, even very robust, safety procedures at a nuclear power plant [would be insufficient].” The alleged taking of staff as hostages in Chernobyl highlighted the dangers to functioning reactors where operators were essential to shutting them down and keeping them cooled. “There are various different challenges from a staffing perspective. Firstly, can the staff actually get into work without being killed?” said James Acton, co-director of the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He added that reserves of diesel for emergency generators became a critical issue in the midst of a war. “Even if you’ve turned the reactor off, you still have a bunch of intensely radioactive fuel that’s generating heat in the core, and so it needs cooling continuously,” Acton said. “Without a grid connection, you’re reliant on whatever fuel or energy you have stored on site, and that is a finite quantity.”",News/World news,Fears mount for safety of Ukraine’s nuclear reactors amid Russian invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/nuclear-meltdown-threat-ukraine-russia-attack
2/26/2022,"A former MP and investigative journalist has refused to divulge the sources of his information about the 1974 Birmingham pub bombings in a hearing at the Old Bailey. Chris Mullin, 74, is challenging an application by West Midlands police to require him to disclose source material dating back to his investigation in 1985 and 1986. Mullin has refused to divulge the information that would reveal the identity of the man who confessed his role in the bombings to him in an interview years ago, in the action brought under the Terrorism Act of 2000. He said that if the application were to succeed it would “set a precedent which could be used to undermine the freedom of journalists to investigate alleged miscarriages of justice and other matters in cases involving terrorism”. “This is a unique and deeply concerning case, especially to anyone who cares about public interest investigative journalism in this country,” Gavin Millar QC, for Mullin, told the recorder of London, Mark Lucraft. “After the Birmingham pub bombs my client tracked down and interviewed a person who was prepared to own up in detail to having planted the bombs. The person did so reluctantly, not to promote terrorism or proclaim their role in the bombings but so that Chris Mullin could show that the Birmingham Six were – as the whole world subsequently came to know – innocent. “Now the state – in the form of the West Midlands police, the very force that was responsible for failing to investigate the bombings properly at the time and instead framed six innocent men – seeks an order under the Terrorism Act forcing him to hand over documents in his possession to enable them to identify the person he interviewed.” Earlier, James Lewis QC, for West Midlands police, told the hearing that one of the men responsible for the bombings, only described in court as AB, in which 21 people died and more than 200 were injured, had made a “voluntary, reliable confession” to Mullin. “The real perpetrators have never been brought to justice,” said Lewis. Now the West Midlands police were reinvestigating the case and relatives of those killed in the bombing were “campaigning for justice for their loved ones”. He argued that there was a “strong and compelling public interest” in the court making a disclosure order because of the gravity of the case. Mullin has declined to provide data, including unredacted notes and notebooks, because the information was given on the understanding that he would never reveal his source. Mullin said in his statement that “I hold no brief for the terrorists responsible for this atrocity … I have every sympathy with those whose loved ones died and were I in their place I, too, would want those responsible to face justice.” He added that “it must be said that at the time [when he published his initial findings], the West Midlands police were completely uninterested in pursuing any such line of inquiry. This would have required them to acknowledge that they had framed six innocent men … I believe my actions were overwhelmingly in the public interest.” The court heard that Mullin had written an article in which he stated that “I know the names of the bombers … I will never name him.” Mullin briefly responded to questions in court from Lewis about the identity of his sources by responding twice: “I am not prepared to say.” A decision on the seeking of disclosure was reserved.",News/UK news,Journalist refuses to disclose source material in 1974 Birmingham pub bombings,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/25/journalist-refuses-to-disclose-source-material-in-1974-birmingham-pub-bombings
2/26/2022,"One day England will play Wales at Twickenham without a full-blown global crisis gathering momentum. Two years ago the Covid-19 curtain was on the verge of crashing down, and this week’s grim events in Ukraine have put the travails of sport into similarly sharp perspective. Even on the biggest days there are more important outcomes in life than the result of a rugby game. However, once the last notes of the anthems have floated upwards and a minute’s applause has been conducted in memory of Evesham RFC’s Jack Jeffery, who died recently while playing in a club match, there will be a brief opportunity for temporary escapism. The nerves and pent-up emotions felt by all players have to be funnelled somewhere. The question, as ever, is which of the two teams can best handle the pressure and thrive on it. As recently as Thursday afternoon England were looking as well placed in that regard as at any time since the 2019 Rugby World Cup. Then came the familiar twang of a Manu Tuilagi hamstring, such a fundamental element of Eddie Jones’s red rose orchestra. The predominant sound now is the gnashing of teeth in the Manchester area, Sale having once again seen their man crocked in England’s care. If this latest setback does not entirely tilt the playing field it is the most unfortunate Twickenham timing since a positive Covid test sidelined England’s then-captain Owen Farrell before the autumn internationals. Should one man(u) make such a difference to a squad’s collective psyche? Of course not, but for a variety of reasons England are struggling to wean themselves off their longtime Tuilagi dependency. Partly that is because there is no like-for-like replacement and partly because, deep down, they know the 30-year-old is a one-off. At some point, though, the irregular sugar rush of having Manu back in midfield needs to be replaced by something more sustainable and more consistently reliable. Is there another team in the world whose self-belief is so reliant on one individual? As it happens the nearest challenger is probably Wales and their injured captain Alun Wyn Jones, who is missing a Six Nations game against England for the first time in 15 years. In his absence against Scotland, though, Wales carved out the grittiest of wins, shaped precisely in the Lions skipper’s image. Now it is England’s turn to fill their crater-sized midfield hole with something equally wholesome. Leaving aside the table and the necessity for both teams to win if they wish to claim this season’s title, this is a significant contest for numerous reasons. Wales may be underdogs but if they lose as badly as they did in Ireland then last year’s champions will be back at square one, fiercely debating the regional and club issues which, longer-term, clearly need addressing. Another character-laden victory, on the other hand, would speak volumes for the spirit of Wayne Pivac’s squad. It would also deflate the “New England” balloon, just as Scotland did at Murrayfield in the opening round. Having trailed in fifth last season, England would be left staring at another bottom-half finish unless they contrive to upset Ireland and France in their remaining fixtures. Barring something spectacular, though, it really should be England’s day even with Tuilagi missing. The return of their chilled-out captain Courtney Lawes always puts his side more at ease and Marcus Smith, as he showed against South Africa in November, loves a full house at Twickenham. The hosts are also hoping to enjoy more luck from the match officials than in Cardiff a year ago when Wales’s 40-24 win was not without its controversial refereeing calls. There was also the 33-30 game at Twickenham in 2020 when the late red card shown to Tuilagi by the New Zealander Ben O’Keeffe prompted Jones to suggest England had been pitted against “16 men.” The real common denominator, though, has been Wales’s resourcefulness and a white-shirted tendency to blow hot and cold. England, as we keep saying, have the individual talent. They just need to plug it all into the mains and let properly rip. Manage that and it could turn into a tough gig for Wales. A packed Twickenham crowd, including the sides’ respective patrons the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, could do with a little joy and England, in particular, have it in them to raise the roof. Much attention, rightly, has been focused on the roadrunner-paced zip factor of Harry Randall and the artful dodging of Smith but, without Tuilagi, the home side will initially look to Ellis Genge, Luke Cowan-Dickie and Kyle Sinckler to carry hard and establish the quick ruck speed so crucial to English attacking ambitions. If, on the other hand, the game develops into a stop-start affair it could just favour Wales’s infield kicking game and the combative visiting back-row, bolstered further by the return of Taulupe Faletau, who has a history of discomfiting England. Alex Cuthbert is winning his 50th cap, while Dan Biggar, Tomas Francis and Nick Tompkins can all be relied upon for cussed resistance. The tendency of sides to raise their games against England is also older than Twickenham itself, as the home forwards coach Richard Cockerill is well aware. The last time the Leicester and England hooker was involved in a championship fixture against Wales was in 1999 when Scott Gibbs’s late try wrecked English grand slam ambitions. “As an Englishman you get used to everyone not liking you as much as you would like them to,” said Cockerill after England had concluded their final training session. His nation’s motivation for a home win, though, has been deepened by a desire to celebrate two of their more popular squad members. Sinckler, who has not always had the easiest ride against Wales, will be winning a 50th Test cap, while Ben Youngs will come off the bench at some point for his 115th appearance to eclipse Jason Leonard as the most capped Englishman of all time. Youngs still has a way to go to overtake the great Rocky Clark, who played 137 times for England’s women’s side, but no one amasses such a teetering stack of caps by accident. And if his teammates can start quickly, despite Tuilagi’s absence, the game of his life could be all but settled before he even jogs on.",Sport/Sport,‘New England’ searching for self-belief in Six Nations crunch with Wales | Robert Kitson,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/25/england-wales-six-nations-preview-twickenham
2/26/2022,"Mission accomplished. Gather up the buffet. Pack away the trinkets. Shred the manual of state-approved menacing platitudes. Sport has served its purpose here. And whatever it might choose to do from this point, all that really seems certain is that Vladimir Putin will not be listening. Thank you, Fifa, Uefa, the IOC and our many commercial partners, for your invaluable help with the messaging. That is a wrap. It is hard to know what to do with the news that Uefa plans to move the Champions League final from St Petersburg, Putin’s home town, as an act of censure for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This is of course a necessary step, not least for security reasons, and beyond that for Uefa’s own troubled optics. But the relocation of a final, as the bullets fly in Kyiv, is also a study in pointlessness. From here Uefa’s act of reputation management can only have any worth if all of us, from spineless governing bodies, to useful idiots of the media (present), to consumers everywhere, are willing to learn a very hard and very modern lesson. The only dissenting voice at Fifa’s special committee meeting on Friday is likely to have been Alexander Dyukov, president of the Russian FA and chairman of the board at Gazprom, although even he is unlikely to care too much at this late stage. Schalke can remove the Gazprom logo from its shirts. Uefa can reconsider its sponsorship deal with the Russian state gas provider. But the day has already moved on. The sportswashing has happened. Commerce, politics and televised sporting entertainment have served their purpose. Putin’s Russia has gained influence, soft power, and legitimacy. The home public has been placated. Sochi and Moscow have been used to dole out favours to Putin’s loyal lieutenants. We are at a stage where taking the Champions League final away is like relying on a pointed clearing of the throat to deter the gang of masked men halfway up the stairs, coshes in hand. Putin is already raining death down on the people of Ukraine. He doesn’t care, at this stage, exactly where the football’s going to be played. If sport can take anything from this horror it is that we now know beyond any doubt that this is all for real. That those who talk – so tiresomely: the game’s on! – about dictatorships and human rights are speaking from a place of real consequences. That state of complicity starts, of course, at football’s utterly shameless Swiss headquarters. Gianni Infantino has already made his own oleaginous public statement, deploring violence generally without actually mentioning the word Russia or the name Vladimir Putin. “We woke up and we were shocked by what we saw,” Infantino crocodiled, maintaining an expression of textureless neutrality. History will judge Infantino in the full glare of all his actions, his sycophancy, his cosying up to bloodstained despots. Rewind three and a half years and Infantino was at the Kremlin declaring that the world was now “in love” with Russia, and clasping Putin to his breast like a brother (also present at that meeting, in an odd twist, were Rio Ferdinand and Peter Schmeichel). A year later Fifa’s president was back for the presentation of a Russian state medal. “You welcomed the world as friends,” Infantino told the same President Putin who is currently deploying the largest European land force since the second world war in a bloody and illegal invasion. “The world has created bonds of friendship with Russia that will last forever.” Infantino may have shown himself to be a grotesque, morally invertebrate fool. But that lesson extends to almost all of us on some level: a lesson in something very hard and very cold, in a process that was initially obscure in its endpoint. Amnesty International was among those to introduce the phrase “sportswashing” four years ago. An article on this page in 2018 about Abu Dhabi, Manchester City and the Matthew Hedges affair used the word in inverted commas, and took time to explain where it came from. At times it has looked like a diffuse, insidious propaganda programme. But there is no way now of hiding from the truth of where it can lead, a process in which many of us are co-opted to some degree. After Russia’s World Cup I wrote a book about travelling around the country, still high on the show and the interactions with everyday Russians, and hopeful there might actually be something in that connection, some kind of slow-burn glasnost. But guess what? Vladimir Putin really is a murderous imperialist dictator and the World Cup was a part of his machinery for power. The book feels like a kind of kompromat. And Russia has been brilliantly effective at this on so many levels. Four years ago there were calls in the House of Commons for a World Cup boycott after the Salisbury poisonings. But even then it was hard to see what tangible effect this might have while Russian money and influence continued to sluice through the UK economy, legal system and politics. In her book Putin’s People Catherine Belton writes of London’s financial and political centres rolling over in the face of Russian cash back in the mid-2000s when the capital became known as “Moscow-on-Thames”, the years of yachts and planes, peers on the company roll, the Heathrow “school bus” shuttle back home for the weekly boarding school set. “By the mid 2000s London had gained a reputation as the world’s laundromat, washing hundreds of billions of pounds of dirty money,” Belton writes. “The way had been opened for the KGB to create a vast web of black cash, far larger and more sophisticated than the networks it had installed for black ops and influence peddling in the battle for empire of Soviet days.” A Russian tycoon is quoted as saying: “In London, money rules everything. Anyone and anything can be bought. The Russians came to London to corrupt the UK political elite.” Is this true? If so, how true? The fact those in power in Moscow believe it to be so is probably enough for a start. And yes, sport is simply small beer in this, with a habit of hugely overstating its role in world events. But such is its propaganda value we do tend to get a front-row seat, and to accept it rather guilelessly. I was there at Fifa House in Zurich in 2010 when Putin emerged, a little startlingly, from the back of the press conference hall to take questions after Russia’s successful World Cup bid: a small, ambling man, alone on that large stage, shrugging and looking bored, but radiating a weirdly compelling personal power. It was almost comical, and certainly unnerving. But there can be no false innocence from here, no hope against hope, fingers crossed, for something real behind the platitudes. Ukraine has called for Russian clubs to be expelled from Uefa competitions and this should happen immediately, not just as a punishment but because the spectacle is repulsive and unsustainable in the shadow of war. And from here on in we have been warned. We know, beyond any shadow of doubt, where this stage-management can lead. We know Vlad will not be returning Gianni’s calls, his anxious voicemails. That game has run its course. We have already been played.",Sport/Football,Uefa and Fifa are too late: Russia’s sportswashing has served its purpose | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/25/uefa-and-fifa-are-too-late-russias-sportswashing-has-served-its-purpose
2/26/2022,"Nigel Ng’s comedy career skyrocketed under lockdown, when his Uncle Roger persona, policing other people’s Asian cookery for laughs, went viral on YouTube. A fair few of his five million subscribers will form the audience to the 30-year-old’s current tour, and Ng doesn’t scruple to give them exactly what they want. Jokes about rice, jokes about inadequate British cooking, jokes that – no matter how they begin – tend inexorably towards generalisations about east Asian behaviour. Fair enough: we’re not exactly oversaturated with Asian immigrant perspectives on life in the UK. And many of Ng’s are amusing enough. In character as Uncle Roger, he takes down Boots-branded sushi and western food allergies. As himself (which is pretty much Roger minus the exaggerated accent) he contrasts British versus Asian dating and British versus Asian child discipline, a routine that founders on an over-attenuated gag about John Lewis’s returns policy. Throughout his show, Ng maintains a lively relationship with his enthusiastic crowd. Occasionally the material rises above the generic: Ng addresses a recent breakup and a shocking experience of (it is assumed) racist assault. But even these routines soon swerve back into his Asians-do-this comfort zone. Latterly, it can feel a bit barrel-scraping (“Asians don’t pay for our TV licences, do we?”).

2/26/2022,"Looking dead-eyed into the camera on Friday, Vladimir Putin gave one of the most bizarre speeches of his 22 years as Russia’s leader, a directive that managed to sound alarming even in a week when he has ordered tanks into Ukraine and missile strikes on Kyiv. “Once again I speak to the Ukrainian soldiers,” he said, addressing his enemy. “Do not allow neo-Nazis and Banderites to use your children, your wives and the elderly as a human shield. Take power into your own hands. It seems that it will be easier for us to come to an agreement than with this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis.” The speech seemed to be ripped from an alternate reality – or from the second world war, where Putin appears to be spending more of his time as he launches the kind of broad military offensive not seen in Europe for nearly 70 years. All this week, Putin’s megalomaniacal tendencies have been on display like never before. He has summoned his aides for a surreal national security council that resembled a television reality show and launched tirades about Lenin and decisions made nearly 100 years ago. He has also, for the first time, spoken about his maximalist goals in this war: regime change in Kyiv, toppling the government of Volodymyr Zelenskiy and replacing it with a more pliant leadership. Putin’s call for a coup in Kyiv indicates that if Russia wins this war, Zelenskiy will almost certainly not remain in power. How he achieves that is anyone’s guess. A number of analysts predicted this as Russia deployed more than 60% of its ground forces to Ukraine’s borders and demanded concessions that could never be granted. But Putin’s unhinged appearances and apparent drive to war have raised questions of whether he remains a rational leader. “Despite Crimea and everything else, Putin had always seemed an extremely pragmatic leader to me,” said Tatyana Stanovaya, the founder of R.Politik. “But now when he’s gone in this war against Ukraine, the logic in the decision is all about emotions, it’s not rational.” Those emotions are deeply rooted in history and the historical injustices suffered by Russia. Dmitry Muratov, the editor of Novaya Gazeta, said he saw Putin as a man with “a historical map in his mind and a plan to use his military to achieve it”. Central to that map is Ukraine, which he has described as an artificial state. “Modern Ukraine was wholly and fully created by Russia,” Putin said in a historical sleight-of-hand, “namely Bolshevik, communist Russia.” To help picture it, state TV ran a map earlier this week showing Ukraine cut up to represent which parts were “presents” from various leaders, including Stalin, Lenin and Khrushchev. Some commentators said it represents the partition that Putin himself might be imagining if he gets his way. While once the map may have been viewed as fantasies or media trolling, a western diplomat based in Ukraine on Friday pointed to his speeches and to that map as a serious sign that Putin was weighing up a dismantling of the country. “He is not pretending anymore. For the first time I think he’s revealing who he really is,” the diplomat wrote.",News/World news,‘It’s not rational’: Putin’s bizarre speech wrecks his once pragmatic image,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/its-not-rational-putins-bizarre-speech-wrecks-his-once-pragmatic-image
2/26/2022,"From a distance, it feels like Oscar Piastri was destined for the pinnacle of motor-racing. “My dad’s dad and my mum’s dad, my pop and my granddad, they were both mechanics,” the 20-year-old Australian says. “And my dad – his business is a car-tuning business. So I think it was naturally running in the family.” When Piastri was six, his father Chris returned from a business trip with a remote-controlled monster truck. “I was just fanging around with that in the backyard,” he says. Remote control racing led to go-karting, which led to Formula Four, Three, Two and now, this year, a reserve driver spot with BWT Alpine in Formula One. “That [monster truck] led to the journey I have taken so far.” But for all it may seem as if Piastri was preordained for motor-racing greatness, it has taken considerable sacrifice – and millions of dollars – for that goal to be within reach for the Melbourne-born driver. And despite winning the F3 and F2 championships in consecutive seasons, the Australian has not yet made it to the heights of F1. “It has been an awesome run in the junior categories,” he says. “I think the results speak for themselves.” But in the cut-throat world of motor-racing, results alone are not enough. Ahead of the season opener next month, an F1 seat remains so near, yet so far for Piastri. The prospect of becoming the 18th Australian F1 driver in history, and joining compatriot Daniel Ricciardo on the grid, eludes him – for now. The late afternoon sun shines on Piastri as he speaks over Zoom, from a backyard in Portsea on Victoria’s Mornington Peninsula, at the end of his summer break. A return to Europe beckons (he is based in Oxford, England) ahead of his first year globe-trotting with the international circus that is Formula One. The Australian intends to give it his all; he is a few minutes late to the interview, having been sprinting up and down the nearby sand dunes by way of pre-season training. “I’m looking forward to the challenge,” he says. “It’s going to be a different year to what I am used to, as I won’t be doing any racing. It is a new challenge, another step towards my goal of becoming a full-time F1 driver.” F1 reserve drivers spend most of their time working with the team to support the two primary drivers: on simulators fine-tuning the car, doing testing, sometimes driving in practice sessions. But Piastri will only get an opportunity to race if one of his teammates, Fernando Alonso and Esteban Ocon, is sick or injured. Which means that after spending his teenage years racing as much as possible, 2022 will be an adjustment. “There’s still a lot of work I can do behind the scenes, trying to learn as much as I can about the F1 world,” he says. “How the [race] weekend works, how the season schedule works with all the flying around, getting used to different time zones and so on.” Having won F2 last year, there was nowhere for Piastri to go but up; champions are not permitted to compete again. Yet with only a handful of seats up for grabs across the 10-team, 20-driver grid, Piastri always knew that a year on the sidelines was likely. In the end, the final spot – with Alfa Romeo – was taken by Chinese driver Guanyu Zhou (despite Zhou having finished third, behind Piastri, last year). Motor-racing is not cheap. In an interview with The Age last year, Chris Piastri estimated that his family, together with sponsors and supporters, had put about $6m into Piastri’s pursuit of his F1 dream. When the driver was just 15, Piastri senior was outlaying half a million dollars as his son travelled on the international go-karting circuit. The costs only increased: $1.5m to race F3, and a similar amount for his lone season in F2. (Piastri senior is the founder of an automotive software company.) Piastri speaks openly about this substantial investment in his future. “My parents never, ever, put pressure on me from a financial point of view,” he says. “But I’m quite a realistic person. I was aware of how much money was being spent. I never felt guilty, I guess … I was extremely grateful to be given that chance, that opportunity. A lot of people in life and in racing never get that kind of opportunity. So I felt I owed it to myself, and to my parents and other people investing in me, that I should do well.” He has done exceptionally well to date. “I don’t think the pressure ever really mounted up on me, but of course there were a few moments where you go: ‘This is a lot of other people’s money. So this first reserve driver role, while I haven’t made it to my ultimate goal yet, it was quite a relief to be getting paid, to finally turn professional. “I’d be lying if I said that [$6m sum] wasn’t an extraordinary amount of money. The entry barrier to F1 is very, very high.” The corollary of the costs is that, even at the highest level, the financial backing behind a driver can be the difference between earning a seat, or not. Zhou is expected to bring Chinese commercial interest to the sport; Nikita Mazepin and Lance Stroll both race for teams bankrolled by their fathers. “This year is a tricky situation because there weren’t many seats available,” Piastri explains. “In Zhou’s case, specifically, it’s a very big commercial drawcard, for the sport, and sponsors, to have the first Chinese driver in F1. I know Zhou got quite a lot of criticism for being in F1 – and I thought that was quite unfair [Piastri has been vocal in defending Zhou]. I knew that we couldn’t bring that kind of money.” The Victorian concedes that being Australian, he could never compete with the commercial potential of a Chinese driver. Nor, says Piastri, would he want to pay to play. “I want to get to F1 purely on merit, not because we could buy myself a seat. It’s been part of the game for a long-time, but I didn’t want to get to F1 because I paid to get there. I wanted to get there because I had the results.” Most observers believe that it is only a matter of time before Piastri, who turns 21 in April, is driving in F1. He will spend this year learning from Ocon and Alonso; the latter, a two-time champion, is expected to retire at the end of the season, which may leave an opening. “Working with Fernando, it’s a great privilege,” Piastri says. “Certainly I can learn a lot off him this year. I want to learn as much as I can for when it’s my turn to get in the race seat.” Piastri is also guided by his agent, Mark Webber, the Queanbeyan-born driver who collected nine F1 wins during a glittering career. In the F1 paddock, Piastri will find himself alongside a crop of talented young drivers that have considerably lowered the grid’s average age. The likes of Ocon, Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc, Haas’s Mick Schumacher, McLaren’s Lando Norris, Mercedes driver George Russell and Yuki Tsunoda of Scuderia AlphaTauri are all 25 or younger. “These guys are proving that they can perform almost straight away – they’re already fighting for wins,” says Piastri. “Every time that happens, it opens the door for more young guys, such as myself.” The most prominent young star is, of course, Max Verstappen, the 24-year-old F1 champion. The Red Bull driver beat rival Lewis Hamilton to the 2021 title in controversial fashion in Abu Dhabi in December. Months on, the drama of that race still lingers – governing body the FIA recently moved aside its race director, Australian Michael Masi, in an attempt to end the furore. Piastri is diplomatic when asked about the incident. “It definitely was very hectic,” he says of the final race. “I don’t really have much of an opinion, to be honest, I think maybe the rules could have been followed a bit better. But I for one am happy that the race actually got underway again for a lap, rather than finishing under safety car. I think there would be a much more negative reaction if the world championship … was decided under safety car. There you go – I won’t say any more on that.” After the dramatic conclusion to last season, there will be much anticipation when the F1 begins in mid-March in Bahrain, before it heads to Saudi Arabia and then Melbourne, for the first-time since the pandemic began. Even on home soil, Piastri will be sitting on the sidelines. “It’s never ideal not to be racing, but it’s just the way the cards have fallen,” he says. For now, at least. “I feel like I deserve a chance in F1.”",Sport/Sport,"Australia’s next F1 star Oscar Piastri: ‘I want to get there on merit, not buy a seat’ | Kieran Pender",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/25/australias-next-f1-star-oscar-piastri-i-want-to-get-there-on-merit-not-buy-a-seat
2/26/2022,"BP has been warned of government “concern” about its involvement in Russia, in a telephone call between business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng and the oil company’s boss Bernard Looney on Friday. Kwarteng is understood to have spoken to Looney in the light of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, which has increased scrutiny on British business ties to the Kremlin and led to sanctions against Russian firms. Speaking after the call, a Whitehall source said: “BP left the meeting with no doubt about the strength of the business secretary’s concern about their commercial interest in Russia.” Kwarteng is believed to be uneasy about BP’s 22% stake in Rosneft, the Russian state oil firm, particularly given its role in providing fuel for the military effort in Ukraine. The British oil “supermajor” has been deeply entwined with Russia for years and holds two seats on the 11-strong board of the company. Rosneft is run by Vladimir Putin’s de facto deputy, Igor Sechin, who has been nicknamed Darth Vader due to his fearsome power. The two firms operate a “strategic partnership” that sees them cooperate on research, as well as on oil and gas projects such as Taas-Yuryakh in Eastern Siberia. The arrangement is the legacy of a $55bn deal in 2013 that saw the Moscow-based firm take over BP’s joint venture, TNK-BP. In BP’s most recent set of annual results the state oil company contributed $2.7bn in underlying profit to BP’s bottom line last year, up from just $56m the year before, or just over 21% of its bumper $12.8bn profit for the year. Sources familiar with the situation said Looney and Kwarteng discussed BP’s extensive Russian interests during a call on Friday. While the UK has imposed a range of sanctions on Russian businesses, including the airline Aeroflot and banks Sberbank and VTB, partnerships involving BP and its UK rival Shell have been unaffected. BP boss Bernard Looney and his predecessor, Bob Dudley, both sit on the board of Rosneft, which is chaired by former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder. The relationship has long been mired in controversy: when he was boss of TNK, Dudley fled Russia in 2008 amid fears over his safety and what was described by BP as an “orchestrated campaign of harassment”. BP has already been under fire for soaring profits and dividends amid an intensifying cost of living crisis, as well as pressure to slash emissions and move away from oil and gas exploration.

2/26/2022,"Democrats enthusiastically welcomed Joe Biden’s supreme court nominee, Ketanji Brown Jackson, who if confirmed would serve as the first Black woman on the United States’ highest court. As reactions poured in from both sides of the political aisle, Barack Obama shared his congratulations about the news of Jackson’s nomination. “I want to congratulate Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson on her nomination to the Supreme Court,” said Obama in a statement. “Judge Jackson has already inspired young Black women like my daughters to set their sights higher, and her confirmation will help them believe they can be anything they want to be.” The Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, shared his support via Twitter: “With her exceptional qualifications, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson will be a Justice who will uphold the constitution and protect the rights of all Americans, including the voiceless and vulnerable.” Senate majority whip Dick Durbin of Illinois, who is also chair of the Senate judiciary committee, also praised Jackson’ selection. He said: “To be the first to make history in our nation you need to have an exceptional life story. Judge Jackson’s achievements are well known to the Senate judiciary committee as we approved her to the DC circuit less than a year ago with bipartisan support. We will begin immediately to move forward on her nomination with the careful, fair, and professional approach she and America are entitled to.” South Carolina representative James Clyburn, who helped get Biden to make a pledge for a Black woman supreme court nominee, also celebrated Jackson’s nomination, writing in a statement: “Ketanji Brown Jackson, an outstanding judge on the DC circuit court of appeals, has been nominated by president Joe Biden to become the first African American woman on the US supreme court. This is a glass ceiling that took far too long to shatter, and I commend President Biden for taking a sledgehammer to it. I congratulate Judge Jackson and offer my full support during the confirmation process and beyond.” “This is a historic day for women, for BIPOC representation, and for our Judiciary,” tweeted Florida representative and co-chair of the Democratic Women’s Caucus Lois Frankel. Progressive Massachusetts representative Ayanna Pressley also added her voice, tweeting: “Bold. Principled. Qualified. Dedicated to justice. POTUS has met the moment with the historic nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson and we must have swift confirmation.” “233 years. That’s how long we have waited to have a Black woman nominated to the supreme court,” wrote Missouri representative Cori Bush about Jackson’s nomination. “There are no words to describe how my soul is moved by witnessing her nomination.” Progressive advocacy groups similarly shared their congratulations. “We need a justice on the bench who will uphold reproductive freedom. This historic nomination is a chance to shape the court for decades to come,” tweeted the pro-choice group Naral Pro-Choice, alluding to important abortion cases that the supreme court has heard recently, including the Texas abortion ban and an upcoming case that will decide the fate of Roe v Wade. Some Republicans seemed notably less joyous about Jackson’s nomination, following on their complaints that race and gender should not play a role in the selection process despite similar commitments from past Republican presidents. “If media reports are accurate, and Judge Jackson has been chosen as the supreme court nominee to replace Justice Breyer, it means the radical Left has won President Biden over yet again,” tweeted South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, adding that Democrats potentially blocked the nomination of Judge J Michelle Childs. Childs, a judge in the US district court for the district of South Carolina, had notable bipartisan support from her state’s congressional delegation due to her non-Ivy league education and judicial reputation. But she had less support from some progressives, who questioned her work at a private law firm defending employers accused of race and gender discrimination as well as sexual harassment. Graham previously voted to confirm Jackson to the DC circuit court last June. In his statement, Clyburn, a close Biden ally, also acknowledged Childs as a potential Biden pick, writing: “Although not the finalist, Judge Childs’ inclusion among the three that were interviewed continues her record of remarkable contributions to making this country’s greatest accessible and affordable for all. And, she continues to make all South Carolinians proud.” Senator Susan Collins of Maine, another Republican senator who confirmed Jackson to the DC circuit court, also released a statement on Jackson’s nomination, writing: “Ketanji Brown Jackson is an experienced federal judge with impressive academic and legal credentials. I will conduct a thorough vetting of Judge Jackson’s nomination and look forward to her public hearing before the Senate judiciary committee and to meeting with her in my office.” Republican senator Mitt Romney of Utah, a potential yes vote for Jackson’s nomination, also released a statement on her selection: “One of my most serious constitutional responsibilities as a senator is to provide advice and consent on a supreme court nomination, and I believe our next justice must faithfully apply the law and our constitution – impartially and regardless of policy preferences. “Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is an experienced jurist, and I know her historic nomination will inspire many. I look forward to meeting in person with Judge Jackson, thoroughly reviewing her record and testimony, and evaluating her qualifications during this process.”",News/US news,‘Historic day’: Democrats praise Biden supreme court pick Ketanji Brown Jackson,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/feb/25/reaction-biden-supreme-court-pick-ketanji-brown-jackson
2/26/2022,"It was 12.48am on Monday morning, and a fully crewed train with passengers on board was preparing to leave Sydney’s Central station, bound for Wyong on the New South Wales central coast. That’s when an order arrived for the service to be cancelled. A few minutes earlier, at 12.43am, the chief executive of Sydney Trains, Matt Longland, had ordered the immediate shutdown of the state’s entire rail network. Following a weekend of increasingly fraught negotiations with the Rail, Tram and Bus Union over planned industrial action, the senior bureaucrat’s decision would see Sydney’s entire train network closed all day Monday, leaving thousands of commuters across NSW stranded and costing the state’s economy millions of dollars. Meanwhile, the state’s transport minister, David Elliott, was at home asleep. It was only when he woke up on Monday morning that he learned about the shutdown, Elliott has insisted, despite evidence revealed in Fair Work Commission hearing transcripts showing the department had been planning for the possibility of a shutdown since at least the previous Thursday. The release of the transcripts was enough for the NSW opposition leader, Chris Minns, to call for Elliott to be sacked, the first time Labor has called for a minister to lose their job since Minns took over from Jodi McKay in May last year. Minns said it was implausible to suggest Elliott had not known the shutdown was coming. “At the very least, he’s an incompetent minister, not in charge of his portfolio,” he said. And while the premier, Dominic Perrottet, insists he retains confidence in the transport minister, not all of his colleagues agree. Many were bemused by Elliott’s survival this week. “It’s a fucking debacle,” one government MP told the Guardian. “As far as a defence goes, ‘I was asleep’ has to rank quite highly in terms of pure incompetence.” It’s by no means the first time that Elliott has caused headaches for the government. In his previous role as the state’s police minister, he made headlines for telling a 17-year-old P-plater that he “worked for the cops” during a road incident in 2019; posting photographs online of himself firing two banned firearms; and defending the practice of strip-searching children as young as 12. That Elliott has managed to survive has much to do with factional convenience. A key member of the Liberal party’s centre-right faction, a demotion from cabinet would be difficult for Perrottet to achieve without setting off an unwanted internal brawl. In a government dominated by moderates and Perrottet’s right faction, Elliott’s position is important at a time when the NSW division of the Liberal party is beset by a maelstrom of factional infighting. There is also no doubt Elliott inherited a troubled portfolio. After 11 years in power the NSW government has found itself dealing with multiple transport debacles, from project delays and cracked trams to an ongoing controversy over a $40bn rail asset holding entity which saw the auditor general delay signing off on the state’s finances for months. Elliott has made no secret of his displeasure at the department’s recent history and he quickly sought to take ownership of the long-running dispute with the union after he was sworn in as minister. On Christmas Day he was quoted in a Daily Telegraph story blasting his own officials for a “ludicrous” refusal to allow transport staff to wear shorts to work and vowing to shake up the portfolio. Such confidence apparently extended to his staff. In a post on social media his chief of staff, Tanya Raffoul, wrote glowingly that Elliott was best placed to negotiate an end to the industrial dispute.. “As he turns his attention to a portfolio riddled with industrial action, delays and infrastructure issues, I’m certain that he is the only cabinet minister who could successfully tackle this portfolio,” she wrote after he was sworn in. Communications between Elliott’s staff and the department could prove crucial in who gets held accountable for Monday’s fiasco. The minister’s denial of any knowledge of the shutdown has left colleagues – and reportedly the premier himself – furious. Perrottet made his displeasure known when asked about Elliott’s decision to go to bed as the situation evolved on Sunday night. “The minister will reflect on that and realise that all ministers are available 24/7,” he said. “That’s my expectation as premier.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But it has also stretched the credulity of some government insiders, who say that it’s unlikely such a major decision would have been made without the knowledge of the minister or his office. Who knew what is now the subject of an internal investigation, due to the legislative requirement for the department to inform the minister before making substantial decisions regarding the network. In a statement to the parliament this week, Elliott conceded the department believed it had fulfilled its requirements before making the decision. “Transport considered it had discharged those obligations, however my office remained of the view until approximately 1.30am that there would be a significant disruption to services but not a total network shutdown,” he said. “What is clear is that the communication between the department and my office was not sufficiently precise.” Elliott has insisted that the 10.43pm text message from Raffoul saying he had been “briefed” does not prove he was aware of the shutdown, because it only referred to “significant interruptions”. He also appeared to goad Labor on that fact in parliament this week. When Minns first revealed the existence of the text during question time on Tuesday, Elliott challenged him to show written evidence contradicting his claim that he did not know about the closure: “I have not seen anything in writing to suggest that what I have said in the house is any different,” he said. A day later, Elliott told parliament that after a meeting with Perrottet and the NSW transport secretary, Rob Sharp, he had been told “that in future [any] significant developments in the activities of the department must be the subject of a written briefing and written endorsement”. The evidence released by the Fair Work Commission raises further questions. Affidavits filed during the tense weekend negotiations reveal that as early as Thursday last week the department had flagged the possibility of a shutdown if the industrial action went ahead. Ahead of the planned action, a risk assessment conducted by Sydney Trains completed on 16 February concluded that the “risks associated” with the union’s planned action meant the rail system would need to be shut down. While Elliott has said it was only a “contingency”, the existence of the document places further pressure on his version of events. “The transport minister needs to go, otherwise there is absolutely no accountability in the NSW government at all,” Minns said.",News/Australia news,Has the Sydney trains fiasco derailed David Elliott’s career for good?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/26/has-the-sydney-trains-fiasco-derailed-david-elliotts-career-for-good
2/26/2022,"Victorians have poured a record amount of money into poker machines since Covid-19 restrictions lifted, losing $251m in December last year – the highest monthly loss in the state since records began. It surpassed the previous record set in ​​December 2008, when $250m was lost to electronic gaming machines (EGMs) after the first wave of stimulus payments as part of the federal government’s response to the global financial crisis. Pokies losses data released by the Victorian Gambling and Casino Control Commission (VGCCC) on Friday revealed the state’s residents lost another $224m using EGMs in January, despite the havoc that record high Covid infections wreaked on the hospitality industry that month. The worst losses were concentrated in areas ranked as most disadvantaged, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ index of relative socio-economic disadvantage (IRSD), which calculates disadvantage based on factors including employment and income levels, and access to education and services. Losses were highest in Brimbank, which is Melbourne’s second-most disadvantaged LGA and the third-most disadvantaged in the state. Over November, December and January, $42m was lost to pokies in Brimbank, with almost $15m lost in December alone. At the time of the last Census, the median household income for Brimbank residents was $487 a week for an individual and $1,263 a week for a household – significantly below the state median incomes of $644 and $1,419 respectively. Brimbank has also been hit hardest by the state’s Omicron wave, reporting the highest number and rate of deaths from Covid in the state since December. Just five of the 79 local government areas in Victoria that contain poker machines accounted for more than a quarter (25.81%) of the state’s pokies losses in the past three months. Those five LGAs – Brimbank, Hume, Greater Dandenong, Whittlesea and Casey – are some of the most disadvantaged, with Greater Dandenong ranked second-most disadvantaged in the state overall. Losses in Casey between November and January tallied $37.9m. In Hume, $34.8m was lost. In Greater Dandenong, $34.7m was lost. Whittlesea’s losses added up to $33.7m. Gambling reform advocates estimate that about 40% of losses from EGMs come from high-risk gamblers, which means revenue levels for pokies licence holders – that is, gambling losses – is a rough measure of levels of harm. Reduced revenue, conversely, is a sign that harm minimisation measures are working. Poker machines were first installed in Victoria in 1991, under Labor premier Joan Kirner. EGM losses in the state have been increasing in the decades since, but monthly losses began frequently exceeding $200m from 2004. In the 2019 calendar year, prior to the onset of the pandemic, Victorians lost $2.7bn on EGMs in total. December’s record losses were “a sobering reminder” of the dangers of gambling and “a record that should never have been broken”, said Tim Costello, chief advocate for the Alliance for Gambling Reform. The alliance has called for tougher regulation to hold the broader industry accountable in the wake of the damning royal commission into Crown Resorts, which continues to operate the lucrative Melbourne casino. In August 2021, in the midst of the royal commission, the Victorian state Labor government announced it would overhaul the regulatory body, the Victorian Commission for Liquor and Gaming Regulation, and the new VGCCC would have greater oversight in monitoring gambling harm-minimisation measures in both the casino and broader gambling industry. “Yes, people are waking up to the harm being done by this predatory industry,” Costello said. “Yes, the Victorian government has committed to first steps in holding Crown accountable. But what about the hundreds of millions lost every month in pubs and clubs? What action is being taken to address this crisis?” Costello pointed to measures such as pre-commitment systems that require gamblers to set limits on their gambling spending in advance, reduced opening hours for pokies venues and abolishing losses disguised as wins – when a player wins less than they bet – as key to reducing the amount of gambling harm felt in the community. Samantha Ratnam, leader of the Victorian Greens, said the record-breaking losses were “unfortunately really shocking but also not surprising”. “The longer we wait to protect people from the predatory pokies industry, the more families are likely to be preyed upon and the more it’s going to cost Victorians,” she said. The Greens have advocated for harm-minimisation measures including $1 bet limits, $20 pre-loading maximums, and jackpots not exceeding $500. The Victorian government has been approached for comment.",News/Australia news,‘Sobering reminder’: Victorians lose record $251m to poker machines in a month,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/26/sobering-reminder-victorians-lose-record-251m-to-poker-machines-in-a-month
2/26/2022,"Rod Sims says he was “in two minds” when he met Josh Frydenberg last year to discuss seeking another term as head of the market watchdog, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Although the verdict to go was later reported as his choice, Sims, 71, says he had gone into that chat with just a few concerns about continuing. “We talked it through and we came up with a joint view”: it was time to move on. Needing a nudge hasn’t been Sims’s style during his almost 11 years as ACCC chair, a role that officially ends 20 March. This past week, he launched a farewell tour a month early with a flurry of media interviews and a National Press Club address to highlight unfinished business. Lawyer Gina Cass-Gottlieb, Sims’s successor, will become the first woman to head Australia’s main competition regulator since the Commissioner of Trade Practices began in 1966. In the past decade, the ACCC has taken on new tasks, including monitoring electricity and gas markets, financial services, agriculture and digital platforms. That five “made a big job, a very big job”, Sims says, adding, “I love the variety. I love the complexity.” It’s a job that absorbs Sims 12 hours a day Monday to Thursday and seven to 10 hours for the other days. One measure of his term’s success is whether Australia is a more or less competitive economy than a decade ago. “It’s a very good, tricky question,” Sims says. “Certainly Australia has a lot of sectors where they’re very concentrated and because of that, we’re not very competitive,” he says. “You see that when Australian companies who’ve got a very strong position in Australia go overseas and end up making a mess of it,” says Sims. He agrees that banks often struggle while tech firms are among those more likely to be “competitively fit”. Tougher fines have been one way the ACCC has sought to encourage business behaviour that benefits consumers, with penalties soaring from $1m to as much as $50m. Breaches can climb to 10% of a firm’s turnover. The commission can’t take much credit for the introduction of new technology that has shaken up some industries, such as Uber’s entry into the taxi business, but its intervention – with strong support from Frydenberg – to take on the power of digital behemoths, such as Google and Facebook (now Meta), had a huge impact. “The 2019 digital platforms survey was a good report but I never thought it would have that level of, I guess, admiration all around the world,” Sims says, listing inquiries from US and Canada, the European Union and the UK, Indonesia and Africa. Of particular pride for Sims are the news media codes, just one of 23 key elements in the report. Forcing Google and Facebook to negotiate with media companies for use of their content has reaped more than $200m a year for publishers, Guardian Australia included. “It has, I think, meant a lot more journalists are getting hired, a lot [fewer] journalists are getting put off,” Sims says. However, while the media code has helped “even up the bargaining imbalance”, market information remains far from perfect. Most deals are three to five years, and Sims has tallied up the $200m-plus figure himself. “How do I know the numbers? Just by talking to chief executives at different times; sometimes just judging the mood, and putting some parameters around it,” he says. “[It’s] very much a personal calculation but I’m certain I’m right.” He’s less sure about why Facebook continues to resist sharing their spoils from advertising with SBS and the Conversation. That stance “is just inexplicable”, and something Treasury will look at when it reviews the code “fairly soon”, Sims says. The two publishers are “vitally important sources of news information”, and may lead to Facebook being “designated”. That outcome would require the US company to negotiate “with faith” or be put into arbitration, he says. “I don’t think there’s any threat of designation sitting over Google’s head,” Sims said. “But there is with Facebook.” For its part, Meta says it will “continue to engage with publishers” and that commercial deals were just one of the ways it “provides support” to them. In some ways, it would be handy if the ACCC earned a commission from its success. When taking on business miscreants, staff are typically paid far less – sometimes half – of what their adversaries make. Stopping the gamekeepers from joining the poachers can be a challenge. “We try to make up for that with good quality work and a lovely working environment and so far that’s sort of working,” Sims says. On other matters, the behaviour gas producers have exhibited in misleading state and federal governments over the effects of sucking up east Australian gas for LNG exports remains a sore spot. “If you’re confronted by companies wanting to invest $20bn in a project and they say they have the gas, and they say it won’t affect domestic prices, it’s just hard to say ‘no’,” Sim said. By building three of those huge LNG export trains when they had only secured enough gas for two, producers ended up more than doubling domestic gas prices. (Subsequent reports suggest the cost to the wider economy were significant.) “The companies are also liable because some of their executives told governments that domestic prices wouldn’t increase,” Sims says. “That was clearly wrong.” More lately, ACCC reports have called for additional onshore gas production, arguing extra supply would push down prices. That’s because once the LNG export plants are at capacity, producers can’t export more and “the link with the overseas markets is broken”, he says. Sims doesn’t intend to fade into the regulatory sunset. He plans to write “a decent article” about the news media bargaining codes, and “think about international issues facing antitrust”. He also has links to a London-based competition policy research network, for which he will chair its steering committee, and he’s hoping to land a university perch in Australia, although nothing is settled. There might even be spare time to cheer on his AFL team Hawthorn and catch up with friends. “It would be nice not to have me working so many hours,” Sims says. “So if somebody says ‘come for a visit’, you actually can.”",News/Australia news,Reining in the digital giants: Rod Sims on the trials and triumphs of a decade as head of the consumer watchdog ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/26/reining-in-the-digital-giants-rod-sims-on-the-trials-and-triumphs-of-a-decade-as-head-of-the-consumer-watchdog
2/26/2022,"If you watch politics closely, you’ll recall this moment. In 2018, Scott Morrison draped his arm around Malcolm Turnbull and declared: “This is my leader and I’m ambitious for him!” Two days later, Turnbull was out and Morrison was prime minister. That moment popped into my head this week as I watched Morrison out on the hustings in Tasmania. The more recent circumstances were quite different, but the vibe was similar. Morrison was flanked by Bridget Archer, the moderate Liberal, who has made a name for herself in Canberra by (wait for it) saying what she thinks and doing what she believes is right. A journalist asked the prime minister whether he continued to support her. If this seems like a strange question, let’s contextualise quickly. Archer was one of five MPs who torpedoed Morrison’s signature religious discrimination bill in part because the package failed to protect transgender children in religious schools. Before that, Archer also worked with the independent Helen Haines to bring on an unscheduled debate about a federal integrity commission – the anti-corruption body Morrison promised voters but failed to deliver. She’s capital-T trouble, in other words. But Morrison was having none of this naysaying. “You know, we love Bridge,” he enthused. “We really do. And I’m really pleased she’s on my team, and she’s on my team and she’s a fiery member of my team and she’s a fiery member for Bass.” But before anyone could grab a fire extinguisher, or order an “I heart Bridge” campaign T-shirt, there was a plot twist. Still in Tasmania, Morrison went on to endorse a private senator’s bill being spearheaded by Claire Chandler. Chandler, a conservative, is Archer’s Tasmanian colleague. Chandler’s bill would allow sporting groups to exclude transgender people from single-sex sports. Sporting codes seem either bemused or openly hostile towards this proposal. Chandler says she pursued it to save women’s sport, and because Tasmanian parents want it. If we track back to Archer and the religious discrimination proposal, she crossed the floor in an effort to protect and support trans kids because she knows they are a vulnerable cohort. She didn’t do it to be liked, or to be thanked. Archer did it because if you believe God is love, you really can’t stomach doing anything else. She told parliament she feared doing anything other than what she did would “risk lives”. In the days following her decision, there’s been gratitude. But there’s also been hostility. So Morrison’s effusive on-ground endorsement of the Chandler proposal looked pretty pointed. Almost like a prime minister’s love of “Bridge” might be a teensy bit conditional. In any case, the personalities don’t matter as much as the signal. Morrison at the moment is like a truffle-hunting dog, sniffing out his path to election victory. He has spent this past week hot on the trail of two wars: one lethal, the other cultural. Obviously, the lethal conflict is the horror playing out in Ukraine. We’ll get to that war, and its local political implications, shortly. But first, let’s consider Morrison’s experimental culture war: a war on wokeness improvised during a campaign stop in Tasmania. Ever since his religious discrimination legislation hit the fence, Morrison has been throwing red meat to the right of his party. The prime minister has to do this, because safeguarding religious freedom was what conservatives (including the prime minister himself) wanted in return for the legalisation of same-sex marriage. Morrison failed to deliver. As losses go, this was a bad one. Morrison rolled out of the setback by launching a sonic boom on China. He would be more Dutton than Peter Dutton, which, let’s be honest, takes some doing. Then, more protein for conservatives the following week. This full-throated endorsement of the Chandler bill. It was a “terrific” proposal. “Claire is a champion for women’s sport and I think she’s been right to raise these issues in the way that she has,” Morrison said. “Well done, Claire.” Morrison is singularly focused shoring up his own position – and apparently reckless enough to lurch from reds under the bed to casual transphobia to land that objective. But his project is bigger than holding out any last-minute regicidal brain explosion by raging rightwingers during budget week. Morrison is very plainly on the hunt for disaffected but highly motivated voters. Perhaps it’s simplest to think of Morrison’s tactics this way. If the 2019 election was about him whispering sweet nothings in the ears of “quiet Australians”, the 2022 contest is about the prime minister picking up a loud hailer so he can be heard by the noisy folks. He’s courting a noisy, minority of voters alienated from the major parties, from government as a construct, and in some cases, from rapidly shifting societal and cultural norms. People in politics report there is a cohort of Australians right now who are riled, and emotional. Call that the legacy of the pandemic. While Australian society has moved a measurable distance in favour of inclusion and tolerance, MPs say constituents uncomfortable with the idea of people transitioning are energised and motivated by their discomfort. For some – often people who have had no lived experience of loved ones in crisis – the whole trans conversation is the practical manifestation of cultural relativism and progressivism gone mad. When hackles are raised you get othering. Tribalism. Shunning and shaming. We see similar raised hackles in the public protests against vaccination mandates – this existential sense that powerful forces have shifted a known centre of gravity in an unfavourable direction. Morrison thinks he needs to engage that cohort of voters because he can’t trust that preferences from disaffected rightwingers will flow back to the Coalition on election night. Now we need to think about Ukraine. Australians have been watching the dead-eyed Vladimir Putin creeping towards lethal aggression for some weeks now. Russia’s escalation on Thursday wasn’t a shock, but it is one thing to understand intellectually that something bad can happen and another thing to watch an invasion of another country happen on live television. It would be an understatement to say the times are deeply disconcerting. The events of this past week lay the foundations of Morrison’s khaki election. The prime minister very obviously believes the Coalition can prosper politically in this uncertainty. But to do that, Morrison has to bring that sense of threat, or dread, back home. If you watch what the prime minister is saying, you’ll already have worked out how he’s doing that. The bridge between Ukraine and Australia is China. His political messaging is happening at two levels. The big picture Morrison is painting is if Putin can do this – ignore the sovereignty of a peaceful neighbour and grab what he wants – so can the regime in Beijing. This could happen in our neighbourhood is the point. Morrison is speaking about China almost as much as he’s speaking about Ukraine at the moment. Why won’t China condemn Putin? Why is China at odds with the west? Why is China easing trade with Russia? What is China hiding? All very reasonable questions, of course. But this post-invasion posture from Morrison is also part two of the China frenzy from the week before – the wild talk of Manchurian candidates, and Anthony Albanese being Xi’s candidate to win in May. Morrison’s political objectives are blindingly obvious. What is less clear is whether his current tin hat foray can cancel out the accumulated domestic disaffection of the past 12 months. Is come to daddy an automatic vote winner for the Coalition in 2022? Our latest Guardian Essential poll suggests voters are inclined to see complexity where Morrison is intent on packaging aggressive simplicity. Morrison spent last week telling voters China was bad, and bad China wants Labor to win. Voters responded by telling the pollsters at Essential that Australia’s relationship with China was complex. Disapproval of the prime minister also ticked up, suggesting voters are now sceptical about Morrison and his relentless shtick. But that survey was taken before Russia stormed over the Ukrainian border. When it comes to fighting Australian elections in the shadow of war, or substantial geopolitical realignments, or security threats, I can tell you what recent history shows us. But I can’t yet tell you how this story ends.",News/Australia news,"From a China frenzy to casual transphobia, PM is on the hunt for disaffected but highly motivated voters | Katharine Murphy",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/26/from-a-china-frenzy-to-casual-transphobia-pm-is-on-the-hunt-for-disaffected-but-highly-motivated-voters
2/26/2022,"A fund established to help farmers fight nationally significant court cases will pay for some of the legal costs of a company part-owned by Angus Taylor to challenge a finding that it destroyed critically endangered grasslands. The Australian Farmers’ Fighting Fund, which is administered by the National Farmers’ Federation, is providing financial support for the federal court case, which was launched by Jam Land in December. Jam Land is part-owned by the energy minister and his brother Richard Taylor, who is also one of the company’s directors. Late last year, a ministerial review affirmed that Jam Land had illegally cleared up to 28.5 hectares of natural temperate grassland on a property in Corrowong in southern NSW and was required to remediate. It also found the clearing to be in breach of a civil penalty provision of the environmental protection legislation. Jam Land was ordered to restore 103 hectares of grasslands on the property in the Monaro region of New South Wales. The company is challenging the remediation determination and is seeking a declaration that the listing of the natural temperate grassland of the south-eastern highlands as critically endangered in 2016 by the then-environment minister, Greg Hunt, was invalid.

While Angus Taylor’s interest in Jam Land is through an indirect shareholding, it puts him in the unusual position of being connected to a case challenging the decision of one of his government’s own ministers. Richard Taylor, who has previously described the legal action as a matter of principle, said the costs of the case were expected to amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars. He said through discussions Jam Land initiated via the NSW Farmers Association that the Australian Farmers’ Fighting Fund (AFFF) had agreed to make “a significant contribution”. He declined to put a figure on the value of the contribution. “One of the reasons that we’re pleased they have supported the case is that they support cases that are of significance to farmers,” Taylor said. “It just demonstrates that the case is of great importance to agriculture.” The fund, whose involvement in the case was first reported by the Weekly Times, has previously supported legal actions such as the successful class action launched by farmers in response to the 2011 ban on live cattle trade to Indonesia. The fund did not answer specific questions from Guardian Australia but its chair, Hugh Nivison, provided a statement saying the fund had approved an application from Jam Land “for support in a matter concerning the interpretation of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act”. “In approving the application, the trustees determined the matter was a clear demonstration of the ambiguity and uncertainty in the act, and how the government’s approach to its implementation could have massive ramifications of farmers,” Nivison said. “In supporting this case, the AFFF seeks to resolve that ambiguity and uncertainty so Australian farmers can manage their land for balanced production and environmental outcomes, knowing with certainty what rules they have to follow.” The Jam Land investigation has been controversial because Angus Taylor sought meetings with senior environment officials about the grasslands while the investigation was under way. Documents released to Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws in 2019 revealed treasurer Josh Frydenberg’s office subsequently sought advice about whether laws protecting the grasslands could be changed. Angus Taylor has repeatedly stated that he sought the meeting with departmental officials on behalf of constituents in Hume who were concerned about the grasslands listing. He has previously said: “I did not make any representations to federal or state authorities in relation to any compliance action being undertaken.” The department has previously said officials did not discuss the compliance matter with Taylor. Both Taylor and Frydenberg have said the meeting was focused on the “technical aspects” of the grasslands listing. Guardian Australia has been told Angus Taylor has had no involvement in the legal action, the decision to launch the appeal or the decision to seek support from the AFFF.

2/26/2022,"Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest has ridiculed the idea that by signing up to a Facebook account he signed away his rights. After years of attacking Facebook’s refusal to remove scam ads featuring his face, Forrest launched civil proceedings against the social media behemoth in California. He alleges the company’s failure to stop cryptocurrency-related scam ads were “negligent” and a “misappropriation of likeness”. In response, Facebook argued it was protected from liability because Forrest had a Facebook account, and had therefore agreed to the site’s terms and conditions. Forrest has now hit back at that claim, saying it must have come from a “junior lawyer” and emphasising that he launched the suit to protect victims, not himself. “That was obviously a junior lawyer who didn’t know jack about what he was talking about,” Forrest told Guardian Australia. He said when fake pages claiming to be him started proliferating on the site, his cybersecurity team worked with Facebook to clear them out, and to do that had to create an official Andrew Forrest page. “There were ‘Andrew Forrest’ pages appearing everywhere, particularly Andrew Forrest saying he’s lonely and if you’re out there, and you’re a rich, lonely (woman) … This was ages ago,” he said. So he “joined” Facebook when an official page was set up to counteract the fake ones, to “stop a crime”. He said he was taking action in California “not on behalf of myself … which is obviously why a junior lawyer made the comment [that he had signed away his rights]”. “They’ve obviously said that hundreds of times to thousands of victims,” he said. “I’m taking it on behalf of victims, for them, so nothing to do with me. I’m not bound by anything from Facebook if I’m taking action on behalf of victims, not on behalf of myself.” Social media ads falsely using Forrest’s and other high-profile Australians’ faces are being used to sell overpriced goods, or simply to take people’s money without providing anything in return, particularly when selling cryptocurrency. In one case, a Bunbury woman lost $670,000 to the scam, making payments to Australian and German bank accounts and to a credit card after she saw the fake ads on Facebook and LinkedIn. Forrest has argued since then that Facebook should be regulated as a publisher and made to take responsibility for the scams. He has launched separate criminal proceedings in Western Australia, alleging that Facebook has breached federal money laundering laws by failing to stop the ads. In the case lodged in the United States, he said Facebook was using its algorithms to allow alleged fraudsters to target vulnerable users, so it was “not simply providing neutral tools”. “Facebook is directly involved with developing and enforcing a system that subjects its users to illegal content,” the court filing states. Facebook argued that it has limited liability and that its terms of service make it clear that Facebook makes no guarantees it will always be “safe, secure, or error-free”, and that it does not control and is not responsible for third parties. In its response, filed in court, Facebook has argued that it cannot be held liable on a number of grounds, including that it is protected by section 230 of the US Communications Decency Act, which limits the liability of websites for third-party content posted on those websites.” Although it will not comment on the cases, Facebook has previously told the Guardian that it takes “a multifaceted approach to stop these ads” and is “committed” to keeping these people off the platform. Guardian Australia has contacted Facebook, now known as Meta, for comment.",News/Australia news,Andrew Forrest hits back at Facebook claim he signed away his rights,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/26/andrew-forrest-hits-back-at-facebook-claim-he-signed-away-his-rights
2/26/2022,"“There was no struggle, nothing. And then he just slipped away ... the river swallowed him.” This is how a witness described the final seconds of Dr George Duncan’s life, as told to the ABC in 2005, 33 years after the 41-year-old University of Adelaide academic drowned in the River Torrens and posthumously set in motion the zeitgeist of gay law reform in Australia. The 10 May 1972 death of Dr George Ian Ogilvie Duncan – suspected to be at the hands of Adelaide’s police vice squad, at a time when homosexuality was outlawed in every state in Australia – is an event enshrined in the narrative of the South Australian LBTQI community. Writer Christos Tsiolkas and his partner Wayne van der Stelt first learned of Duncan’s revered place in SA’s legal history back in the mid-1980s, when the two young Melbourne university students made their first road trip together to Adelaide. “I remember us going to the Candlelight, which was one of the old queer clubs there, and hearing the story about what happened down at the river – hearing about the gay bashings and police bashings,” he says. “There was still a real sense of being in a frontier town … we were in the bourgeois, nice part of Adelaide, but we were getting warnings from gay men we were talking to in pubs, saying just be really careful. It was still going on, that was still part of the story of the city.” On 3 March, Adelaide festival goers will witness the multi-award winning Melbourne writer’s debut as a librettist, with Watershed: The Death of Dr Duncan, co-written with Sydney playwright Alana Valentine. Marking the 50th anniversary of Duncan’s death, the production, directed by Neil Armfield, will be delivered in the form of an oratorio, created by Queensland opera and composer Joseph Twist. Tsiolkas and Valentine agreed that the traditionally sacred form of oratorio – opera without the sets, costumes and staging, and deemed appropriate by the church for tackling religious material – was the most fitting medium to tell Duncan’s story. “One of the things about being queer is being sequestered from the sacred,” Tsiolkas says. “There’s a sense of being exiled from religious traditions and Duncan was a religious man [he was high church Anglican]. “That was what was great about writing an oratorio … doing it but not denying our queerness, because that’s what religious texts have done – deny that our bodies are part of the sacred. “Duncan died at a gay beat and we wanted that world to be communicated in the words of the music … That’s been exciting, working on those two things, the sacred and the illicit together.” The background story documenting Duncan’s life is compelling, as historian Tim Reeves can attest. The white upper middle class, Australian raised and Oxbridge educated history academic lived a secret life, as most gay men were forced to do, growing up in the 1950s and 1960s . Reeves has spent the better part of three decades documenting the Duncan case, he served as a consultant on the Watershed project and will be releasing his book The Death of Doctor Duncan at the Adelaide Writer’s festival on 9 March, where it is being launched by David Marr. The death toll from Australia’s long-standing criminalisation of homosexuality – through murder, manslaughter and suicide – was far from unique in the English speaking world, he says, but the rapidity of legislative changes following Duncan’s death was a world game changer. Three police officers were early suspected as the culprits who tossed Duncan, a man who despite his education at Melbourne Grammar – an exclusive school which prided itself as much on its athletic prowess as its scholastic rigour – was unable to swim. After an internal police investigation prompted widespread public skepticism, Scotland Yard detectives were called in to investigate independently – but the subsequent findings tabled in a parliamentary inquiry found that “there was no real intention of causing anyone’s death – this was merely a high-spirited frolic which went wrong.” In Watershed: The Death of Dr Duncan, the oratorio features a work with the chorus: “We thought faggots could float”. Within seven weeks of Duncan’s body being retrieved out of the Torrens, however, a private members bill was introduced into South Australian parliament. And in one of the more surprising details in Reeve’s book, it was not SA’s celebrated reformist premier at the time – Don Dunstan – who led the charge. It was a conservative in opposition to the incumbent Labor party, Murray Hill – then a member of the Liberal and Country League party, later to become the SA liberals – who pushed for legislation to decriminalise sex between two consenting adult males in the southern state. Reeve’s book reveals other disturbing details that are unlikely to make it into the oratorio’s libretto: the witness to Duncan’s drowning, Roger James, who first told his story to the ABC in 2005, was also tossed into the Torrens that night (he was never able to identify his assailants). James crawled out of the water with a broken leg and was rescued by a passing motorist who took him to hospital. That seemingly good samaritan was Bevan Spencer von Einem, subsequently convicted of the abduction, sexual torture and murder of 15-year-old schoolboy Richard Kelvin, and the suspected killer of at least two other gay men whose cases have never been solved. Von Einem remains incarcerated in a high security SA prison, marked never to be released in his lifetime. And in a final indignity to Dr Duncan himself, when the police finally retrieved his rigid body from the Torrens, the local TV news cameraman was running too late to capture it; the police returned Duncan’s body to the river and fished it out again for the broadcast. Hill’s legislation was modest. It only prevented police from raiding – without a warrant – private homes where two adult men were living together. But within three years, SA became the first jurisdictional territory in the English-speaking world to legalise equal age of consent for sexual intercourse at 17 years, regardless of gender. Tsiolkas was only 10, but remembers it well. “I didn’t have the words to express it at that age – about my identity and my sexuality. But I remember hearing the news…it must have on television, and I remember this quiet thrill – like it started in my belly. I couldn’t talk to anyone about it. But that change was huge.” Valentine says the LGBTQI community today still remains profoundly aware of the way the law governs their lives. “All gay and lesbian and transgender people are uniquely aware of the fact that we live our lives subject to the law, and that the laws have a profound influence on the way you can behave publicly – what the limits of your love are and how they are defined legally.” Spending decades delving into the life of Dr Duncan – a man who has no surviving relatives to speak on his behalf – Reeves admits to the Guardian he is conflicted about the role he has played in the sudden resurgence of public interest in the academic’s life and death. “He was an extremely shy, intensely private and taciturn man, he may never have identified publicly as homosexual,” Reeves said. “And yet he has become a gay martyr, a queer icon in modern day parlance. I can hear him muttering darkly from the grave … if he is an icon, it is not because of his own actions, but because of his cowardly killers, who thought it was OK to throw poofters into the Torrens and then flee as they sank to the riverbed.” In his conclusion in the book, Reeves writes: “I am the person most responsible for placing Dr Duncan on a pedestal that would not have been of his choosing. I ask now that he be remembered as more than just an epithet.’’ Tsiolkas is more ambivalent. “Dr Duncan was a man whose life was taken in 1972. He hasn’t done what all of us sitting around this room have done … move through time. “I wonder, if he hadn’t been killed, would he have eventually found a way to find joy? To find pleasure, find love in the tumult of change that started to emerge? What kind of life could he have lived? And I think that’s the tragedy of the story, that’s the life that was taken away.”  The Death of Dr Duncan by Tim Reeves is out now through Wakefield Press.

2/26/2022,"As I unsubscribe from the ninth email in three days urging me to “refinance now!” if I don’t want to miss a “special rate!”, I curse my email doppelgänger. She’s landed us on a marketing database again and now I’m being inundated with spam. My email doppelgänger is the person whose emails I receive in error, presumably due to an extra vowel or missing dash. I don’t know if she’s actually a “she”, but I’ve constructed an identity for her from the bits and pieces I think I’ve gleaned: female, teacher, resides in the US. Despite the spam, I’ve become quite fond of my email doppelgänger, who is generally an inoffensive character. This feeling is just another example of the kind of one-sided parasocial relationship that is so ubiquitous in this era of mass media and digital communication. These people are strangers to us, but through small glimpses of their lives we feel as if they’re not. That’s due to a media psychology phenomenon called the media equation, according to Elizabeth Cohen, an assistant professor of communication studies at West Virginia University. “We tend to process things socially, even if they’re not really social,” Cohen says. “So, for instance, we act polite and considerate to machines such as computers and cars, even though we know they aren’t human. “We also empathise with celebrities even though we’ve never met them before, and we grieve for fictional characters even though they’re not even real. This occurs because we are, as a matter of human nature, hardwired to be social.” Not everyone is so lucky when it comes to their email doppelgänger. Take Katie*, who, as an early Gmail adopter with a very common name, has dozens of them. There’s Katerina in New York who didn’t show up for her second Covid vaccine, Ashley in Texas who owes her chiropractor $3,000, and the one who has a friend in North Carolina who likes to send photos of hamburgers. Katie has been getting these emails for years and admits they can be a drag. “It reaches a point where it’s so absurd,” she says. “I got caught up in this email thread of a kid’s soccer team … and they were fighting over who was picking up who from soccer practice. That one was probably the worst.” There was also the woman who bought a Nissan Pathfinder in Las Vegas. “I was getting reminders for her to service her vehicle. I felt kind of bad for her because I wondered if she just couldn’t afford it,” Katie says. This makes me think of the kind of narrative you might construct about a stranger passing in the street. There is something innately fascinating about catching a glimpse into someone else’s world and imagining what their life is like. In the online world, we are constantly surrounded by a kind of digital version of people-watching, only instead of a particular attitude or sense of style, we read people through their digital ephemera: what they subscribe to, where they live, or their travel and eating habits. “In digital media environments, there’s often not a lot of identity cues that you can gather about other people, compared to face-to-face communication at least, so the cues that you do get carry a lot of weight,” Cohen says. “When you get a small little snapshot of somebody’s life – somebody who shares something similar to you, like a name, by getting a misaddressed email – it’s pretty intriguing. It might not be much knowledge, but it kind of feels like an intimate knowledge because it’s personal.” So what do you about these people? Perhaps the ultimate response to an online doppelgänger was that of Josh Swain of Tucson, Arizona. In April 2020, Swain created a Facebook Messenger chat of all the Josh Swains he could find on the platform and challenged them to fight for the right to use their common name. there can only be one pic.twitter.com/VPamxjJ0yL “Precisely, 4/24/2021, 12:00 PM, meet at these coordinates, (40.8223286°N 96.7982002°W) we fight, whoever wins gets to keep the name, everyone else has to change their name, you have a year to prepare, good luck,” Swain wrote. A year later, hundreds of people named Josh turned up at Air Park in Lincoln, Nebraska. Five-year-old Joshua Vinson Jr was crowned the winner of a pool-noodle competition open to anyone with the first name of Josh, while the original Josh Swain from Tucson won the right to keep his name via a heated game of rock, paper, scissors with Josh Swain from Omaha. Of course, if you don’t have the energy to organise a mass pool noodle fight, there are other ways to make the best of things. Katie once signed into the Hulu account of one of her doppelgängers, watched a few movies listed in the premium subscription and logged out – but not before changing the password in a bid to alert the user to their error. Another time, when she was really fed up, she had the confirmation of a restaurant reservation go to her account. “I was like: ‘Why did you make a reservation during Covid?’ And so I cancelled the reservation. I felt terrible, but you know it was the height of Covid and I was like, ‘Don’t be going’.” Without these juicy options in the case of my own doppelgänger, I’ll have to content myself with the judicious use of the delete button for now. Katie preferred not to reveal her full name or Twitter handle, perhaps to avoid further doppelgängers",News/Technology,My inbox is piling up with spam again and my email doppelgänger is to blame | Shelley Hepworth,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/26/my-inbox-is-piling-up-with-spam-again-and-my-email-doppelganger-is-to-blame
2/26/2022,"Russian forces have reached the outskirts of Kyiv and carried out an amphibious assault from the Sea of Azov near Mariupol, a day after attacking Ukraine from three sides on a massive scale. In the capital air raid sirens wailed and heavy gunfire and explosions were heard in a number of districts, as Russian military vehicles approached from the north-west. The defence ministry in Moscow claimed its forces had taken control of the strategic Hostomel airfield to the north-west after a day of fighting. Pressure was also intensifying around Chernihiv, about 90 miles (145km) north-east of Kyiv, Ukraine’s military said, with Russian forces trying to bypass the city and head to the capital down the E95 road to Kozelec and ultimately Kyiv’s eastern suburbs. Further east, about 125 miles from the capital, the city of Konotop was lost to Russian forces. According to the Pentagon, 10 amphibious landing ships unloaded thousands of naval infantry to the west of Mariupol, potentially cutting off the port city on the Sea of Asov. Fighting was reported to be continuing around Kherson on the Dnieper River and in Melitopol. Elsewhere, Ukraine’s forces were believed to be holding firm in the eastern Donbas region, while the eastern city of Kharkiv, which has a population of more than 1 million, was gradually being surrounded. Russia attacked Ukraine along multiple axes, bringing to a calamitous end weeks of fruitless diplomatic efforts by western leaders to avert war. Fighting and other military activity took place around and on the way to Kyiv, including an ambitious attack by helicopters on the Hostomel military airbase. Ukraine lost control of the Chernobyl nuclear site in the north, where fighting raged after Russian troops crossed the border from Belarus. One Russian line came through the Senkivka border crossing near Chernihiv. A substantial attack was also aimed towards the eastern city of Kharkiv. Russian forces also headed north and east from Crimea. Social media footage showed them reaching Kherson on the Dnieper, 80 miles (130km) inside Ukraine. Over the past few months Russia has forward-deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and even short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric also grew more belligerent. Vladimir Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of its two proxy states in east Ukraine. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. On 22 February a Reuters witness saw columns of military vehicles including tanks and armoured personnel carriers (APCs) on the outskirts of Donetsk, the capital of one of the territories claimed by Russia. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Moscow’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in both Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas of Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment has since grown. Half of Russia’s air force is now deployed near Ukraine, according to western estimates. Russian warships conducted training exercises in the Black Sea in the run-up to the invasion. This footage released by the Russian defence ministry shows a Ka-27PS helicopter taking off and landing on the deck of a frigate during exercises on 22 February. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also show increased deployments in Novoozernoye in western Crimea. The US estimates 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. This image from 18 February shows deployments including armour, helicopters and field hospitals in Novoozernoye: Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to what the UK defence secretary described as potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in air and at sea, although the Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. Since then low-level fighting has continued along the front, and both sides have accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands is a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy company Gazprom has been built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Europe’s most divisive energy project, Nord Stream 2 bypasses the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It has faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increases Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denies Ukraine transit fees and makes it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/russias-war-in-ukraine-complete-guide-in-maps-video-and-pictures
2/26/2022,"Nato will deploy significant extra troops to countries in eastern Europe which are part of the alliance, but UK ministers warned there would be no forces going to Ukraine itself to avoid an “existential” war between Russia and the west. Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, chaired a virtual summit of 30 leaders on Friday, where the agreement was made to amass forces in eastern Europe. “No one should be fooled by the Russian government’s barrage of lies,” the leaders said in a joint statement. “We are now making significant additional defensive deployments of forces to the eastern part of the alliance.” Stoltenberg said Russia’s invasion was “the gravest threat to Euro-Atlantic security in decades”. “Russia has shattered peace in Europe. The people of Ukraine are fighting for their freedom in the face of Russia’s unprovoked invasion. We deplore the tragic loss of life, enormous human suffering and destruction.” James Heappey, a UK defence minister, earlier said the UK would send further armed forces to Estonia “earlier than planned” to reinforce the Nato ally. The Royal Welsh battlegroup will be arriving in the country to double force levels. Heappey also revealed that a total of 1,000 UK troops were on standby to support Ukraine’s neighbours with refugee responses. “The 1,000 troops that are on standby are there to support Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and Poland with the expected humanitarian challenges that they will face as people make their way out of Ukraine,” he said. However, Heappey also warned against any potential meeting between Russian and Nato troops, saying it could become “existential”. Speaking in parliament, he said: “We must all in this house be clear that British and Nato troops should not, must not, play an active role in Ukraine. We must all be clear what the risk of miscalculation could be and how existential that could very quickly become if people miscalculate and things escalate unnecessarily.” During the debate, Heappey was pressed by MPs to support a no-fly zone across Ukraine, which he rejected because of the risk of Nato forces encountering Russian ones. In an earlier exchange on BBC’s Radio 4 Today programme, the Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko pleaded with Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, for the UK and the US to close airspace above Ukraine “in order for these casualties not to escalate”. However, Wallace said this would constitute a direct act of aggression towards Russia, which would prompt a response and result in “war across Europe”, as any attack on the UK would implicate all other Nato members. Wallace said: “To do a no-fly zone I would have to put British fighter jets against Russian; Nato would have to declare war on Russia.” He added: “I cannot and won’t trigger a European war but I will help Ukraine fight every street with every piece of equipment we can support them.” Wallace said the UK had supported accelerating Ukraine’s Nato membership, which would have triggered military intervention from fellow members, but that other countries had been concerned by the pace. He added that other democratic countries had a “moral duty” to continue to arm the Ukrainian forces since it was widely acknowledged that Putin “won’t stop at Ukraine” and would proceed to train his sights on Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as he “doesn’t believe the Baltic states are countries”.He told Sky News: “What you’re seeing on your cameras today is illogical. Putin didn’t need to do this, he didn’t need to occupy a sovereign country. None of the reasons why he would do that stack up. He’s not doing something that’s logical, he’s doing something about his ego and his legacy.” As the EU and UK decided to bring in sanctions against Vladmir Putin, the Russian president, and his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, Boris Johnson and allies from the Joint Expeditionary Force alliance including Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands agreed on the need to go further after a meeting on Thursday morning. Downing Street said the leaders “agreed that more sanctions were needed, including focusing on President Putin’s inner circle, building on the measures that had already been agreed”. It said Johnson had made clear to Nato allies that the UK “stood ready for any further request from Nato’s supreme allied commander Europe to go further with military support to Nato from UK armed forces”. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has said he believes “further financial restrictions” against Russia are needed. He said if Johnson brought forward tougher sanctions on Russia, they would be voted through parliament “very, very quickly” with Labour’s support. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, briefed MPs on the prospect of further sanctions next week and also summoned the Belarus ambassador to London, Maxim Yermalovich, to the Foreign Office. He was told members of its ruling elite would be sanctioned as a result of their role in facilitating the invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces. James Cleverly, the Europe minister, said afterwards: “The UK condemns the role Belarus is playing in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Belarus must stop supporting Russia’s illegal and unprovoked actions.”",News/World news,Nato to deploy extra troops to alliance nations in eastern Europe,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/nato-deploy-extra-troops-eastern-europe-ukraine-russia-war
