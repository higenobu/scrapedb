2/17/2022,"Former President Donald Trump's new social media platform ""Truth Social"" is reportedly launching on 21 February, and promises to be a place for free discussion – as defined by Mr Trump and his associates – and a viable alternative to popular social media sites that have banned him. The site has already drawn mockery and criticism from other social media users, thanks in part to a screenshot Donald Trump Jr shared from the website featuring his father promoting its forthcoming release – on Twitter. The image accompanying the younger Trump's tweet included an image with the text ""BREAKING: This was Donald Trump's first post on 'Truth Social.'"" Below the text is reportedly a screenshot of the Truth Social app showing a post from Mr Trump that reads ""Get Ready! Your favorite President will see you soon!"" The post is curious for numerous reasons. First, Mr Trump appears to be using the same photo he used on Twitter, as well as the same handle: @realDonaldTrump. Presumably Mr Trump chose that handle because he joined Twitter after someone else had already taken @DonaldTrump. Since he runs Truth Social and the app was practically built for his followers to read his tweets, it would stand to reason he could just use @DonaldTrump. The explanation for that may be that the site hopes to have cross-platform connectivity with Twitter. Another right-wing social media site, Gettr, has faced criticism for showing user's Twitter followers with their profile information, making it appear as though far more people are using the site than actually are registered. The site's founder, former Trump spokesman Jason Miller, said this was because the site was aiming to enact cross-platform posting with Twitter. Time for some Truth!!! pic.twitter.com/jvyteDb5gW — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) February 15, 2022 Mr Trump's post on Truth Social also looks identical to Twitter's user interface. It includes comment, retweet, like, and share buttons identical to Twitter's. The retweet button on Mr Trump's post also appears to have been blanked out for some reason. Journalist Ken Klippenstein theorised that the ""low engagement is whited out”. Users on Twitter pointed out the similarities and the irony that Mr Trump has to promote his Twitter alternative on Twitter. ""Can I copy your homework?"" One user wrote, sharing side-by-side images of Truth Social and Twitter. ""Sure, just don't make it obvious."" “Can I copy your homework?”“Sure, just don’t make it obvious.” pic.twitter.com/vDsi6VH0xm — Alex (@TopFighter) February 16, 2022 Another user, YouTuber Beau of The Fifth Column, predicted the site would be a colossal failure. ""Trump's first post on his Twitter clone site was written to people not on the site. This was written to be a screenshot post on Twitter. This will be such a glorious dumpster fire,"" they wrote. Trump's first post on his Twitter clone site was written to people not on the site. This was written to be a screenshot post on Twitter. This will be such a glorious dumpster fire. https://t.co/nFg749LOoa — Beau of The Fifth Column (@BeauTFC) February 16, 2022 Based on the success of other conservative-focused social media sites, the YouTuber may be correct. Gettr, Gab, and Parler have found the most success in the conservative-aimed social media space. Parler's mobile app was downloaded about 11.3 million times before it was banned from the Google Play store. When it relaunched on Apple's AppStore in May 2021, it was only downloaded 141,000 times. According to app analystics firm SensorTower, Gettr has been downloaded 6.5 million times, and Gab has around 4 million active users. Those numbers are tiny even when compared to the monthly active user bases of Facebook – 2.910 billion – and Twitter, which has 330 million monthly active users. MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell also launched what he described as a social media site – FrankSpeech – but that site ultimately just became a dumping ground for Mr Lindell's content and advertisements for MyPillow products and Republican campaign endeavours.",Politics/The Independent,Trump’s Truth Social mocked after new platform is forced to promote his first post on Twitter,https://news.yahoo.com/trump-truth-social-mocked-platform-192730161.html

2/17/2022,"Amy Cavaliere was just 35 when she woke up one morning feeling like something was off with her health. “I had a heaviness in my chest, and I was having trouble breathing,” she tells Yahoo Life. Cavaliere says she told her husband she wasn’t feeling well but thought that her symptoms were likely due to a panic attack — something she had never experienced before. “My husband kept insisting that I needed to go to the hospital, but I was mad at him,” she recalls. “I wanted no part of that. I have three kids, and my focus was to get them to school.” But Cavaliere says her husband called 911 after she started to hyperventilate and developed a gray tint to her skin. Cavaliere says she was still hyperventilating when the ambulance arrived to her home. While she doesn’t have a strong memory of what happened next, Cavaliere says she was told that she went into cardiac arrest once she was in the ambulance — as she was insisting that she was “fine.” Cavaliere was given a shot of epinephrine, aka adrenaline, and “came back quickly, before going into full-blown cardiac arrest and flatlining.” She was then given CPR, which continued as she was wheeled into the emergency department, and for 45 minutes after her second heart attack. “I was shocked with a defibrillator 10-plus times because they couldn’t regain my heart rate,” she says. Finally, her heart rate recovered, and she was put in a medically induced coma. Testing revealed that she had a spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), a condition that happens when a tear forms in a blood vessel in the heart, according to the American Heart Association (AHA). Cavaliere was transferred to another hospital, noting that doctors “were not confident in my brain health after everything that had happened.” She was in a coma for nine days, and, while doctors eventually determined that she would be OK mentally, she developed “really severe double pneumonia” and had one lung collapse. “That almost killed me,” she says. Eventually, she started to recover. Cavaliere’s story is terrifying, and it raises a lot of questions about the signs of heart attack in women. These can differ from those of men, Dr. Rigved Tadwalkar, a cardiologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif., tells Yahoo Life. “Classically, women will have the usual symptoms that you hear of that are present in men, particularly chest pain,” he says. “But women will also have atypical symptoms more frequently or have them as their primary complaint.” While women do experience the traditional heart attack symptoms such as chest pain or pressure, discomfort in the arms and breaking out in a cold sweat, the AHA notes that they’re more likely than men to have less obvious symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting, and neck, jaw or back pain. Other subtle signs include feeling dizzy or lightheaded and unusually fatigued. “The reason for this is still somewhat unclear,” Tadwalkar says. “It comes down to differences in the sexes, but we don’t quite understand why.” Doctors are getting better at detecting these subtle heart attack signs, though. “There are more women in medicine now than ever before, and that’s certainly played a big role,” he says. “We’ve also conducted a lot more research that’s involved women. As a result, we’ve learned more and have more awareness now that these differences exist.” However, like Cavaliere, women experiencing heart attack symptoms wait longer than men to get help, according to a 2018 study. The study’s authors say that may be “due to the myth that heart attacks usually occur in men and because pain in the chest and left arm are the best known symptoms,” rather than the more subtle signs that can signal something is seriously wrong. Cavaliere now sees a cardiologist every six months, takes medications to control her cholesterol and has to follow exercise restrictions to make sure she doesn’t overexert her heart, which no longer pumps at the bottom. “I’m not in heart failure, which is great after everything I’ve experienced,” she says. “I’m just making sure I’m listening to my body and am not being so stubborn about my health anymore.” Cavaliere, who has partnered with the AHA to raise awareness and is now a certified CPR trainer in her community, is urging women to take action when something feels off with their health. “So many women and moms today are so distracted and busy with life, jobs, children and family that we don’t pay attention to what our bodies are going through,” she says. “Listen to your body and advocate for yourself.” Despite her initial protests that day, Cavaliere says she’s glad her husband insisted on calling for help. “He saved my life.” Want lifestyle and wellness news delivered to your inbox?

2/17/2022,"The US says that Russian aircraft conducted risky intercepts of US Navy planes over the Mediterranean. In one of three incidents, US and Russian fighter jets came within five feet of each other, a defense official told The Wall Street Journal. The Pentagon described the dangerous intercepts as ""unprofessional."" Three US Navy reconnaissance aircraft were on the receiving end of ""unprofessional"" intercepts by Russian aircraft this past weekend while flying in international airspace over the Mediterranean Sea, the Pentagon said Wednesday. US officials told CNN that the Russian military aircraft got ""extremely close."" In one of three separate incidents in which Russian Su-35 fighter jets flew alarmingly close to US Navy P-8A maritime patrol aircraft, the Russian jets came within five feet of a US plane, the Wall Street Journal reported. The Pentagon considers two of the interactions unsafe and the other unprofessional, a defense official told the newspaper. ""We have made our concerns known to Russian officials through diplomatic channels,"" the Pentagon said in a statement, adding that ""while no one was hurt, interactions such as these could result in miscalculations and mistakes that lead to more dangerous outcomes."" Although it is not unusual for Russian aircraft to approach US aircraft, the US considers most of these interactions safe and professional, CNN reported. The recent risky interactions, which come amid tensions between Russia and the West over Ukraine, are the first such intercepts since 2020, an official told The Journal. Russia carried out multiple intercepts that were deemed ""unsafe"" that year. In one incident in April 2020, a Russian jet pulled a ""high-speed, high-powered maneuver that decreased aircraft separation to within 25 feet, directly in front of the P-8A, exposing the US aircraft to wake turbulence and jet exhaust,"" the Navy said at the time. The sea service accused the Russian pilots of ""seriously jeopardizing the safety of flight of both aircraft."" Responding to the latest troubling incident, the Pentagon said: ""The US will continue to operate safely, professionally and consistent with international law in international waters and airspace. We expect Russia to do the same.""

2/17/2022,"NEW YORK (AP) — A former newspaper editor who received a pardon from former President Donald Trump pleaded guilty Wednesday to state cyberstalking charges in New York in a deal that could eventually see the case dropped. Manhattan prosecutors said they will withdraw Ken Kurson’s misdemeanor counts of attempted computer trespass and attempted eavesdropping in a year if he performs 100 hours of community service and stays out of trouble. Kurson, a friend of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, was charged in August with hacking his wife’s online accounts and sending threatening, harassing messages to several people amid heated divorce proceedings in 2015. Kurson, the editor of the New York Observer when it was owned by Kushner, sometimes monitored his now-ex-wife’s computer activity from his desk at the newspaper’s Manhattan offices, prosecutors said. The state case mirrored a federal case against Kurson that went away when Trump pardoned him in January 2021 in the final hours of his White House term. Presidential pardons apply only to federal crimes, not state offenses. Assistant District Attorney Alona Katz said in court Wednesday that Kurson has gone more than six years without reoffending and has taken steps to prevent such behavior. As part of Kurson’s plea deal, prosecutors reduced his original felony charges of eavesdropping and computer trespass to misdemeanor attempt charges. If he meets the other terms, prosecutors will exchange those charges for harassment, a low-level offense that is categorized as a violation, not a crime, under state law. A check-in hearing is scheduled for May 18. A message seeking comment was left with Kurson’s lawyer. Kurson, of South Orange, New Jersey, was the first person in Trump’s orbit charged by local prosecutors after being pardoned by the former president, though it’s not the first time Manhattan prosecutors have tangled Trump or one of his allies. Last year, the district attorney’s yearslong criminal investigation into Trump and his business practices led to tax fraud charges against his company — the Trump Organization — and its longtime chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg. Both have pleaded not guilty. Manhattan prosecutors previously charged former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort with state crimes in 2019 as a hedge against a possible pardon after he was convicted in federal court over similar mortgage fraud allegations. Trump later pardoned Manafort in the federal case, and the state case was dismissed on double jeopardy grounds. New York eased double jeopardy protections in 2019 to ensure state prosecutors could pursue charges against anyone granted a presidential pardon for similar federal crimes. In Kurson’s case, double jeopardy wasn’t an issue because his federal case ended before a conviction or acquittal. The federal case against Kurson, who now works in the cryptocurrency industry, arose from a background check when Trump offered Kurson a seat in 2018 on the board of the National Endowment for the Humanities. Manhattan prosecutors started investigating Kurson for possible violations of state law once Trump pardoned him. In explaining the pardon, the Trump White House cited a letter from Kurson’s ex-wife in which she said she never wanted him investigated or arrested and “repeatedly asked for the FBI to drop it.” According to Manhattan prosecutors, Kurson monitored her computer keystrokes in 2015 and 2016 using spyware, obtaining passwords, and accessing her Gmail and Facebook accounts. In October 2015, prosecutors said, he accessed and then anonymously disseminated her Facebook messages. According to a criminal complaint, she told police in his New Jersey town that he was “terrorizing her through email and social media, causing her problems at work and in her social life.” ___ Follow Michael Sisak on Twitter at twitter.com/mikesisak",U.S./Associated Press,Pardoned Kushner pal pleads guilty to cyberstalking charges,https://news.yahoo.com/pardoned-kushner-pal-pleads-guilty-175812117.html
2/17/2022,"By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ken Kurson, a former editor of the New York Observer newspaper who was pardoned in January 2021 by then-U.S. President Donald Trump, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to two misdemeanor charges after being accused of spying on his former wife by accessing her computer. The 53-year-old Kurson entered his plea before state Supreme Court Justice Josh Hanshaft in Manhattan, according to the office of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. Kurson had been charged last August with eavesdropping and computer trespass, both felonies, for using spyware to obtain his wife's passwords and access her Gmail and Facebook accounts between September 2015 and March 2016, around the time they were divorcing. He agreed instead to plead guilty to attempting both crimes. If Kurson completes 100 hours of community service and does not commit another crime within a year, he can withdraw that plea and instead plead guilty to second-degree harassment, a lower level misdemeanor, Bragg's office said. A lawyer for Kurson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Kurson had also been charged in October 2020 by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn with cyberstalking three people, including at least one he blamed for the breakdown of his marriage. Trump's pardon ended that case, but U.S. presidents cannot pardon people for state crimes. ""We will not accept presidential pardons as get-out-of-jail-free cards for the well-connected in New York,"" Bragg's predecessor Cyrus Vance said when bringing the state charges. Kurson was the Observer's editor in chief from 2013 to 2017. The newspaper was once owned by Trump's son-in-law and Kurson's friend Jared Kushner, and endorsed Trump for president in 2016. Bragg inherited a criminal investigation that Vance began into Trump and his business practices. Vance also charged former 2016 Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who also received a presidential pardon, with mortgage fraud and other crimes. That case was dismissed last February on double jeopardy grounds.
