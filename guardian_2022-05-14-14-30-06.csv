5/14/2022,"Here is what the cat does: he waits until I have transplanted a row of seedlings into the fine tilth of the raised bed. Then, for good measure, he waits a few more days, until he is sure I’m satisfied that the seedlings are well established. Then he goes out and shits in the middle of the row. And then, in a belated fit of daintiness, he uses his front paws to pile a huge amount of earth over the turd, burying half the seedlings and raking away the other half in the process. “What’s the point?” I say, coming inside one morning. “Of what?” my wife says. “Gardening is supposed to be good for your mental health,” I say. “And I’m in a constant fury.” The cat glides past, avoiding eye contact. “I know it’s you, you little shit,” I say. “He just sees a big expanse of raked earth,” my wife says. “Everything is clearly labelled,” I say. The cat sits in a square of sunlight, and shuts its eyes. “Like a giant litter box,” my wife says. “Irresistible.” “The old cat never did this,” I say. This is not true: the old cat did do this, but the new cat doesn’t know that. One thing is for certain: there can be no more planting out until I have come up with a solution. Everything else will have to stay shut up in the cold frame for now. I devise a mix of strategies – a barrage of upside-down plastic pots secured with tent pegs; blockades of broken brick; some scraps of netting, interspersed with pointed bamboo sticks at odd angles, and random lines of strings running between them. I can’t work on these defences during the day, because there are builders putting in a loft extension two doors down. From above, it must look as if I’m building a scale model of the Second Siege of Namur. Without any seedlings in the ground, the completed defences hold up for a week. At the end of that time I plant a double row of lettuces and water them in. Two days later they are thriving. The next morning they lie shredded and scattered among broken sticks, strands of limp string, and a freshly buried cat turd. “Why?” I shout, falling to my knees. When I look up, two men in hard hats are staring down at me. I spend the morning in my office shed, working and fuming. The men on the scaffolding two doors over keep up a stream of chatter, shouting to each other across the peak of the roof. When I cross the garden to the kitchen an hour later, they fall silent. “Gardening is for suckers,” I say to my wife at lunch time. “I’m done.” “You have to accept a certain amount of attrition,” she says. “He’s not a slug, he’s our cat,” I say. “It’s betrayal.” After lunch, with grim resignation, I extract the turd from the raised bed. I rescue a few buried lettuces and reassemble my pathetic defences. I count the remaining seedlings in the cold frame: three dozen or so, spread over two shelves, all in good shape. There is still time to plant some more. I make a coffee and sit on the bench against the back wall of the garden, in the sun, where the workmen on the roof cannot see me. In any case, they are quiet; they may still be at lunch. The cat comes out of the house and climbs onto the bench next to me. “Miaow,” it says. “You idiot,” I say. The cat climbs on to the arm of the bench, then the back. From there it leaps to the top of the garden wall, wades through the ivy and strolls across the roof of my office. “Good,” I say. As I sit there I begin to imagine new and unbeatable defences: a perimeter of netting 4ft high, surrounded by a trench lined with upturned dinner forks. I think: how much would 200 forks cost? It is deeply satisfying. After a little while, I fall asleep. I am woken 10 minutes later by a violent bang, and the sound of desperate scrabbling. The cat has jumped down from the wall onto the cold frame, crashing straight through the glazed lid and ending up somewhere inside it. A second later he leaps out and runs off, a blur. “Sure it was him?” my wife says, pulling the cracked plastic lid free. “I saw him,” I say. “He crushed everything.” “He’s snapped about four plants,” she says, looking in. “The rest are actually fine.” “All gone,” I say. “All gone.” Join Coco Khan, Tim Dowling and other Guardian writers for an entertaining look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine on 29 June at 8pm.

5/14/2022,"Fish fingers sold in most UK supermarkets use whitefish caught by Russian ships, despite many chains pledging to boycott Russian produce. While supermarkets have taken steps to signal their solidarity with Ukraine, rebranding their chicken kievs as kyivs and taking Russian vodka off the shelves, they have carried on buying its fish. Big brands such as Birds Eye and Young’s, as well as most major supermarkets, including Sainsbury’s, Tesco, Morrisons and Asda, still use Russian-caught fish. When approached for comment, many deferred to the British Retail Consortium (BRC), which said the UK relied heavily on Russia for whitefish and that “complex supply chains” meant it was “difficult to find other sources”. Of the major supermarkets, only Marks & Spencer and Waitrose said they had stopped using Russian-caught fish in their own products, though Waitrose still stocks brands that use it. Tesco and Asda have stopped buying directly from Russian suppliers. The government announced in March it would introduce sanctions on Russian whitefish, with a 35% tariff on all imports, but the idea was put on hold after representations from industry. A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesperson insisted the sanctions would be going ahead but that it was “subject to further work on the specific implications for the sector”. Steve Trent, the chief executive of the Environmental Justice Foundation, said: “It is unacceptable that British consumers are being sold fish fingers caught by Russian vessels, unknowingly sending their hard-earned pounds to fund Putin’s war machine. The government should take urgent action to end the sale of Russian-caught fish in the UK.” More than 30% of the whitefish on sale in Britain is caught by Russian ships, according to estimates from industry body Seafish. In 2020, the UK imported 432,000 tonnes of whitefish at a value of £778m, meaning the money going to Russia is likely to be in excess of £200m. Britain imports almost 10 times the volume of cod and haddock that it is able to catch, with 1.5m fish fingers eaten every day. Fish and chip shops are also heavily reliant on Russian supply. The shadow fisheries minister, Daniel Zeichner, said: “Doing all we can to stand beside the people of Ukraine means ever-tightening, effective sanctions on Putin’s Kremlin that includes looking at products which have yet to be effectively targeted. “Labour has been pressing the government on the issue of Russian fish being commonplace on UK supermarket shelves and we are disappointed at their lack of urgency to act on this.” Russia accounts for about 45% of the world’s whitefish supply, largely pollack, cod and haddock, and there is fierce competition to find other sources. Much of the Russian fish caught is then deboned in China or elsewhere before being sold to the UK to be processed, which makes it harder for the public to track supply chains. Aoife Martin, the director of operations at Seafish, said: “A lot of companies have already indicated that they will look at alternative products that they can use in place of Russian fish. But that’s not the sort of thing that you can pivot away from easily or quickly. There isn’t an alternative supply readily available.” As brands scramble to source whitefish elsewhere, the price of fish fingers and other processed fish is expected to soar. Andrew Opie, the director of food & sustainability at the BRC, said: “Russian fish is used extensively in the UK food industry, and businesses will be reviewing their sourcing arrangements. Seafood uses complex supply chains, and it can be difficult to find alternative sources which are cost-effective and do not threaten the future of suppliers or breach contracts. “We are waiting to hear from the government on sanctions and tariffs, but they will be assessing the impact on consumers in terms of price and availability.” A Birds Eye spokesperson said: “With the highest inflation in 40 years increasing food and living costs for many families, we are doing everything we can to continue to provide nutritious and affordable fish products, without compromising on our commitment to only use sustainably certified fish.” Birds Eye said that no sanctions were in place affecting the fish it bought and that it was “accelerating our existing strategy to find alternative sources of sustainable fish” to meet an industry-wide challenge. A Defra spokesperson said: “We, with our allies and partners, are imposing the most punishing sanctions ever on Russia following its unprovoked and illegal invasion of Ukraine.”",News/Business,Fish fingers containing Russian whitefish still on sale across UK,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/14/fish-fingers-containing-russian-whitefish-still-on-sale-across-uk
5/14/2022,"‘People often peel vegetables needlessly when just a good scrub will do,” says Victoria Glass, author of Too Good to Waste (Nourish Books, 2017). “Soft-skinned vegetables often don’t need peeling, but when my child started weaning, she’d turn her nose up at any peel whatsoever.” Glass ended up with a buildup of peelings in a plastic box, and, while they were great for stock, there were just too many to use up, so she began coming up with new ways of cooking with them. These vegetable peel pakoras became her favourite recipe. Pakora recipes often instruct you to grate or finely chop vegetables anyway, which is a job saved if you use peelings and scraps otherwise destined for the food-waste bin. Collect scraps in a tub in the fridge or freezer until you have enough to make this recipe. Like most batters, pakora batter is best made in advance, at least 30 minutes before and even a day or two ahead. To save and reuse the frying oil, leave it to cool down completely, strain through a fine sieve and cheesecloth into a container and store in a cool, dark place. Makes 6 70g chickpea flour30g rice flour (or 30g extra chickpea flour)1 tsp salt1 tsp cumin seeds1 tsp nigella½ tsp turmericOil, for frying6 sprigs fresh coriander, roughly chopped300g vegetable scraps – for example, peelings, root greens, spring onion tops, etc To serve (optional)Raita, mango chutney and coriander sprigs Measure the flours into a bowl and mix in the salt, cumin, nigella and turmeric. Whisk in 150ml water to make a batter the consistency of thick double cream, then leave to rest for at least 30 minutes; add more water, if need be, to get the right consistency. Fill a wide saucepan no more than a third full with frying oil and put it on a medium heat. Test the temperature by dropping in a drip of batter: if it bubbles and rises to the surface almost immediately, the oil is ready. Mix the coriander and vegetable scraps into the batter. Pick up a sixth of the pakora mix with a ladle and carefully drop it into the hot oil, then repeat with another ladle or two without crowding the pan. Fry for three minutes, then flip and fry for another three minutes, until golden brown. With a slotted spoon, transfer the pakoras to a rack to drain, and keep warm while you fry the remaining pakora mix. Serve hot with raita and mango chutney.",Lifestyle/Food,How to turn vegetable scraps into mouthwatering pakoras – recipe | Waste not,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/may/14/how-to-turn-vegetable-scraps-into-mouthwatering-pakoras-recipe-zero-waste-cooking

5/14/2022,"Apath slants out of Cwm Nantcol through Coed Crafnant. Among sessile oaks, migrant birds throng after exhausting journeys from Africa. The air is melodic with the velvet diminuendo of willow warblers; leaves of the trees haven’t yet opened, concealing their perpetual activity among high branches. Pied flycatchers – miniature magpies in stroboscopic dance-mode – spill down to flit along tracks and across fields by Pont Crafnant. The wood is flower-carpeted in glorious progression through these spring months. There’s ramson, its white flowers garlic-scented, its triangular stalks delicious to nibble or gather and chop into salads. There are bluebells, of course, in such profusion the shimmer of them seems more emanation than substance. The earliest flowers are the wood anemones, with their foxy scent. Poet Robert Graves knew and loved this path from before the first world war. It sidles round Carreg Fawr, splashes through brief mires where heath spotted and early purple orchids are already showing, to arrive at the mitten-shaped Gloywlyn, the “shining lake”. I make a point of walking this way every spring, usually packing a rucksack with tent, stove and sleeping bag to pitch camp on dry ground at the southern end of this remote and lovely mountain lake. It’s one of my favourite places in the Welsh hills, and one of the great panoramic points among them. Yr Wyddfa broods northerly under a grey pall of cloud. When night falls there’s Enlli’s lighthouse winking from 40 miles across the sea. I came here recently on an evening when the full moon appeared suddenly from behind Rhinog Fawr and soared, silvering the lake and its surrounding grey crags. Then, the drake teal from the pair that’s flown up from the estuary to breed here traced a rippling dark path across the water. I focused my glass on shadows where I sensed rather than saw movement. One of the rangy hill-foxes who are tutelary spirits at all these Rhinogydd lakes emerged into moonlight and drank from the lake margin. He pointed at the teal, which veered sharply away. The fox lifted his muzzle, snuffed the breeze, glared at my tent with eyes glinting like pearls, and was gone.
