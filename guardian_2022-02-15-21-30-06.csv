2/15/2022,"The American west has spent the last two decades in what scientists are now saying is the most extreme megadrought in at least 1,200 years. In a new study, published on Monday, researchers also noted that human-caused climate change is a significant driver of the destructive conditions and offered a grim prognosis: even drier decades lay ahead. “Anyone who has been paying attention knows that the west has been dry for most of the last couple decades,” says Park Williams, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles and the study’s lead author. “We now know from these studies that is dry not only from the context of recent memory but in the context of the last millennium.”  Turning up the temperature – the result of human caused warming – has played a big part. Other studies show how the climate crisis “will increasingly enhance the odds of long, widespread and severe megadroughts”, the researchers write. Noting that as the west is now in the midst of the driest 22-year period in knowable history, “this worst-case scenario already appears to be coming to pass”. The research builds on conclusions from a previous study, also led by Williams, that ranked the period between 2000 and 2018 as the second driest in 12 centuries. The last two incredibly dry years – which were marked by record-setting heatwaves, receding reservoirs, and a rise in dangerously erratic blazes that burned both uncontrollably and unseasonably – were enough to push this period into first. Looking at moisture levels in soils, the team of climate scientists from UCLA, Nasa, and Columbia University focused on landscapes from Montana to northern Mexico north to south and from the Pacific Ocean to the Rocky Mountains. They analyzed data collected tree ring patterns that offered clues to soil moisture levels throughout the centuries. Rings that appear closer together show the stunted growth patterns occurring during dry times. So-called megadroughts, which are characterized by prolonged periods of dryness that span more than two decades, were woven throughout history, the researchers found. Long before human industry, water availability ebbed and flowed naturally. That variability, however, has been intensified by the climate crisis. According to their findings, soil moisture deficits doubled in the last 22 years compared with levels in the 1900s. Human-caused warming accounted for a 42% increase in severity. Worryingly, the west is experiencing a point on an upward trajectory, the researchers warn. There have been many studies showing the connection between human-caused warming, drought, and how these climate catastrophes compound. A large body of research has shown how heat waves will get larger, more extreme, and more frequent. But the evidence offered in this study casts these conditions into broader historical context, showing just how rapidly – and steeply – these changes are developing. Experts and advocates hope it will serve as a call to arms to prepare for a future that is fast approaching. Already, unsustainable systems have started to crack. “We are watching our bank account of water decline,” Williams says, “and we know that eventually we need to slow our expenditures before the account runs out”. The effects are already being felt across the west. In the summer of 2021, both Lake Mead and Lake Powell – the largest reservoirs in North America – reached record-low levels. Nearly 65% of the American west is experiencing in severe drought according to the US drought monitor, even after record rainfall hit some areas late last year. For the first time, federal official curbed allocations from the Colorado River Basin, which supplies water and power for more than 40 million people. Wildfires in the last two years have left behind more blackened earth than ever before and performed feats never thought possible. So far conditions this year have not helped to turn the situation around. California saw one of the driest Januaries on record. February has already delivered heat waves that broke records across the state. By the start of this month, the snowpack has dwindled to below-average, melting rapidly after reaching 160% of average at the start of the year. Forecasts show there’s little short-term relief in sight. “This study highlights the point that we need to reassess our resources,” says Alvar Escriva-Bou, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California’s Water Policy Center. “We can no longer assume that we have enough water for all the things that we want.” Escriva-Bou specifically called on California to reduce its agricultural footprint. Escriva-Bou notes that important steps have been taken to better manage the issue and update operation rules. But “climate change is outpacing us”, he says. According to Jason Smerdon, a climate scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University who worked with Williams on the study, the crisis is a “slow-motion trainwreck”. “These multi-decade periods of dryness will only increase with the rest of the century,” Smerdon said. Still, Smerdon cast the conclusions in a more hopeful light. The extreme events taking place right in people’s backyards may spur understanding and action. “Knowing is half the battle,” he says. “We have a lot of challenges in front of us but we all have agency in the face of this. And there are pathways we can take that are much more sustainable and involve much less risk than the burn baby burn approach that we would take if we didn’t do anything.”",News/Environment,"US west ‘megadrought’ is worst in at least 1,200 years, new study says",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/15/us-west-megadrought-worst-1200-years-study
2/15/2022,"Andrea Riseborough is a powerful actor who could bring emotional complexity to a tomato ketchup advert. Here she’s intense in an understated way as a grieving mother who becomes convinced that the girl next door is her daughter, back from the dead. That reincarnation storyline is not unfamiliar, and to be honest it made my heart sink a bit at first. But this atmospheric and unsettling slowburn drama from Northern Ireland pulls it off, just. Riseborough plays a woman called Laura whose daughter Josie died several years earlier; she lives in Antrim with her husband Brendan (Jonjo O’Neill) and their teenage son Tadhg (Lewis McAskie). They are a family getting on with it, bearing the unbearable. But beneath the dinner table banter, you sense that each of them is alone with their grief. Riseborough signals Laura’s loss and longing in every movement; it’s there in the way she holds herself stiffly upright, like she might fall apart from heartbreak. When 10-year-old Megan (Niamh Dornan) moves in next door, Laura invites her round for tea and picks her up from school in the car. Megan appears to know things that only Josie would know, recalls places that she can’t possibly have seen. Laura starts to believes she is Josie.  This authentic-feeling portrait of family grief then unfolds into something more uneasy, and director Stacey Gregg whips up the mood of a horror film. There’s a jangling score and unnerving camerawork: a creepy drone shot of the family’s ordinary semi at the start and interiors shot in a way that makes the house feel eerie. The question of whether this is a ghost story or if Laura is experiencing a kind of psychological breakdown twists and turns in ways that lost me by the end. Still, it’s is a very accomplished debut from Gregg, and acted with subtlety and sensitivity by Riseborough.

2/15/2022,"Today in a nutshell: Gu just misses out and Goggia makes incredible injury recovery amid a Swiss ski gold rush, while Valieva’s team make an astounding claim Next up: Curling, bobsleigh and ice hockey wrap up today’s events. Tomorrow the men’s ice hockey quarter-finals take place, there is a women’s biathlon relay to enjoy and the prospect of some exciting-looking sprint cross-country skiing  Switzerland’s Mathilde Gremaud soared to gold in the Olympic women’s freeski slopestyle final after holding off another last-gasp charge by Eileen Gu, the American-born emerging superstar representing China, who settled for silver by the narrowest of margins but stayed on course for a historic treble at the Beijing Games. Sheffield’s Katie Summerhayes put down three complete runs that pleased the British team by the finish area, but was unable to challenge the frontrunners and finished in eighth, one place ahead of the talented Aberdeen teenager Kirsty Muir. Sofia Goggia, the Pyeongchang 2018 gold medallist and dominant force in downhill this season, injured the cruciate ligament in her left knee during a crash 23 days ago and it was touch-and-go whether she would be able to race in China. Against the odds she took the silver medal in the women’s downhill today for Italy. “Physically I’m not in shape, I couldn’t charge. I’m not able to move as I want. Sometimes things don’t work as you want. But I really gave everything I could ... I had no room for doubts,” she said afterwards. Gold went to Switzerland’s Corinne Suter, herself having recovered from injury at the start of the season. Meanwhile, Kamila Valieva’s legal team has claimed that the figure skater’s positive drugs test may have come from a contaminated glass of water that contained traces of her grandfather’s heart medication. Sean Ingle has more. Canada won 10 golds in Sochi and 11 golds in Pyeongchang, and have won plenty of bronzes in Beijing but it has been slim pickings at the top of the podium so far. The victory of their women’s team pursuit speed skating was only their second win in 2022. They set an Olympic record in the final as a tumble by Japan’s team they faced meant they finished over 11 seconds ahead. In the men’s team pursuit, Norway became champions. Their opponents, ROC, had set an Olympic record along the way to reaching the final but had burnt themselves out with the effort and simply couldn’t reproduce that pace. The USA won the bronze medal race. Convincing wins for Sweden and Switzerland in today’s set of women’s curling matches see them sitting at the top of the round-robin standings. They should go through, which leaves five countries vying for the remaining two semi-final spots. Three nations – Great Britain, Japan and USA – are tied at four wins and three losses apiece. Canada and South Korea are lurking with 3-3 records having played a match fewer. There are three more rounds of matches to go. In the men’s curling competition, Sweden have confirmed their place in the semi-finals with a seventh straight victory on Tuesday morning. They will play Team GB later on, as Bruce Mouat’s crew look to book their final-four spot. The US beat Finland 4-1 in the second semi-final of the women’s ice hockey competition yesterday to set up a USA-Canada gold medal clash on Thursday. Canada beat the US 4-2 in their group stage match earlier in Beijing. It is a rematch of the 2018 Pyeongchang final which the US team won in a shoot-out. It should be a titanic battle. Slovakia pulled off a bit of an upset in the early men’s ice hockey match today, winning their play-off against Germany 4-0 to book a quarter-final slot against the USA on Wednesday. Denmark beat Latvia 3-2, and they will go on to play ROC. Switzerland will play Finland after defeating Czech Republic in their play-off. “It’s a sense of honour, and a sense of mission fulfilled. I want to say the fans: You wanted an immersive games. Today, I gave you an immersive games,” said China’s Xu Mengtao after winning the women’s freestyle skiing aerials yesterday. Defending champion Hanna Huskova of Belarus took silver and Megan Nick of the US was a surprise bronze medalist. As noisy as it was, you can only imagine how Xu’s victory on home snow would have been greeted with a full crowd. Austria took the men’s team ski jumping gold yesterday ahead of Slovenia in silver and Germany with bronze. Their sixth gold medal of the Games puts Austria fourth in the overall medal table.

2/15/2022,"Wood burning in homes produces more small particle pollution than all road traffic in the UK, according to revised government data. The new data significantly cuts the estimated proportion of small particle pollution that comes from wood burners from 38% to 17%. But wood burning pollution remains a “major contributor” to particle pollution, another government report said. Road transport is responsible for 13% of particle pollution.  The data shows tiny particle pollution, called PM2.5, produced by wood burning rose by a third from 2010 to 2020, when it reached 13,900 tonnes a year. This all comes from the 8% of homes that have wood burners, 95% of which have other sources of heating. The data revision was made after a survey of 50,000 homes provided updated information on the use of wood stoves. Particle pollution is well known to damage health and cause early deaths. “These toxins may enter the bloodstream and be transported around the body, lodging in the heart, brain and other organs,” the report said. “Therefore, exposure can result in serious impacts to health.” The report also found that since the late 2000s, significant decreases in particle pollution from coal burning, industry and vehicles have been “largely offset by increases in emissions from wood burning in domestic settings and [biomass] burning by industry”. “Even after this revision, home use of solid fuel is one of the top two sources of particle pollution in the UK, coming from just 8% of UK homes,” said Gary Fuller, at Imperial College London and a member of the Air Quality Expert Group that advises the government. “My in-box is filled with people who are concerned about the wood smoke that is filling the bedroom of their asthmatic child or ill elderly relative.” The government data on wood burning pollution is based on laboratory tests of stoves. Fuller said: “We need to remember the lessons from VW and dieselgate, where the air pollution produced in the real world was much greater than those in official tests. Data from New Zealand tells us that the same applies to wood burners, with the way that we light fires and the fuels that we use tending to lead to more air pollution than we expect from official tests.” “What is staggering is the increase between 2010 and 2020,” said Simon Birkett, of the campaign group Clean Air in London. “There’s still a really big problem. It’s a public health catastrophe, so wood-burning stoves need to be banned urgently. The first step should be to stop the sale or installation of them.” Other recent research has shown that wood-burning stoves in urban areas are responsible for almost half of people’s exposure to the cancer-causing chemicals found in air pollution particles. Even wood-burning stoves meeting the new “ecodesign” standard still emit 750 times more tiny particles than a modern HGV truck, another study found, while wood burners also triple the level of harmful pollution inside homes and should be sold with a health warning, according to scientists. The data revision was made after the government conducted a new survey of wood burning in 50,000 homes, the biggest to date. Its estimate of domestic wood consumption was substantially lower than the previous survey. The government said the reasons for the different results were likely to include previous assumptions that may be wrong, including that most new stoves were not replacements for old stoves and that users did not sometimes mix coal with their wood. Another factor was that the previous estimate included the “Beast from the East” cold period, which the new estimate did not. “However, it is clear that UK residential emissions from domestic combustion will continue to be a major contributor to the UK emissions of particulate matter,” the survey report concluded. The sector producing the biggest proportion of PM2.5 is manufacturing industries and construction, which is responsible for 27%. But Fuller said: “Lots of people live closer to home chimneys than they do to industrial sources and major motorways. This leads to greater exposure to wood burning pollution than we find for many other sources.”",News/Environment,"Wood burners emit more particle pollution than traffic, UK data shows",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/15/wood-burners-emit-more-particle-pollution-than-traffic-uk-data-shows
2/15/2022,"The family of a 12-year-old footballer of Asian heritage who was racially abused during a match has criticised his local Football Association for a lack of support and said he has received no apology from the opposition team involved. Sathi Balaguru, was playing in a nine-a-side game for Pitshanger FC in west London, when he was tripped and called an “Indian boy” during a penalty incident. Another player on the opposing side directed a racist Indian accent towards him. Sathi is British and of Sri Lankan heritage.  It has left him upset and, 16 months since the incident, he has decided to speak out because he wants “everyone to have an equal chance”. He is concerned the handling of his case suggested his ethnicity may limit his progress in the game. Balaguru was the only player from an Asian background on the pitch and said he now felt as though “having an Asian background will already bring my chances down by about 50% of being a professional footballer”. His experience comes amid concern at the lack of players of south Asian heritage in football’s top flight. The FA describes Asian communities as “the most under-represented in almost every area of the grassroots and professional games”. The Leicester player Hamza Choudhury last year became the first British Asian to win the FA Cup. But in the 2019/20 season only eight out of about 4,000 English professional footballers who played in the top four divisions were British Asian, according to one tally. Sathi’s team was playing Wealdstone Youth FC in October 2020 when the racism flared up and was recorded in the referee’s report. He said he tried to “rise above it”, but after the game he felt “isolated and alone”. “I had never experienced it before,” he said. “I had no way to describe my feelings and I felt paralysed and upset.” Curtis Alleyne, Pitshanger FC’s safeguarding officer, contacted Middlesex FA and Wealdstone but the FA said there could not be any misconduct charges against people under 11, as per the FA rules. A month after the incident Middlesex FA said it was liaising with Wealdstone “who have already begun the education to the players”. Wealdstone’s coach told the referee after the match that he had to shout at a player after hearing Indian accents directed at Balaguru. Alleyne asked Middlesex FA about getting an apology from the club but the FA said this “is not something we get involved with or enforce”. Alleyne complained to the FA that its response “seems to be focused on the accused and education whilst not providing support or assurance of inclusion and anti-discrimination to our player who was the victim”. Middlesex FA told the Guardian it spoke with Sathi, his parents and Alleyne last October and offered help from the Sporting Chance charity, which provides support for victims of discrimination. It said “we fully investigate all allegations of discrimination in line with FA rules”. But Balaguru said: “From the Middlesex FA I have had no support.” By May 2021, Balaguru still had not received an apology and Alleyne complained to Middlesex FA that “no-responses from clubs and governing bodies” were “indefensible”. Wealdstone told the Guardian that it “condemns any instance of racism and deeply regrets the incident involving Sathi and the distress it has caused him and his parents”. It said it apologised to Pitshanger’s team manager shortly after the incident and asked for that to be passed on to Sathi and his family. “We believe the club has apologised to them already but should this apology not have been properly conveyed to them then we would be happy to reinstate it,” it said. Pitshanger said that while Wealdstone was extremely concerned about the incident, its manager did not recall the apology. Middlesex FA said it was committed to making sure football “truly embraces diversity and inclusion and challenges discriminatory conduct”. It said: “we take a stringent stance against any form of discrimination.”",News/World news,"‘Isolated and alone’: boy, 12, racially abused at football match in London",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/15/asian-boy-racially-abused-match-criticise-football-association-middlesex
2/15/2022,"New oil and gas licences for the North Sea are incompatible with the UK’s international climate commitments and the Paris climate agreement, analysts have said. The government is considering licences for new oil and gas fields in the North Sea, under pressure from backbench MPs and media commentators, who claim new fossil fuel development is needed to reduce energy bills.  But the additional greenhouse gas emissions from developing new oil and gas fields, as existing wells are depleted, would bust the UK’s carbon budgets and set the world on course to exceed the limit of 1.5C targeted at last year’s Cop26 UN climate summit, according to researchers at UCL. Daniel Welsby, a research fellow at UCL and co-author of a research note seen by the Guardian on the UK’s potential new licences, said for the government to justify licensing new fossil fuels, ministers would have to be able to persuade other countries to reduce their production. “There is no need for new oil and gas fields in the UK,” he told the Guardian. “For the UK to produce more oil and gas, another oil producer would need to keep their oil and gas in the ground.” The paper, from UCL scientists and commissioned by the campaign group Uplift, says: “The development of new UK oil and gas fields are not compatible with limiting warming in line with the Paris agreement … We recommend a moratorium be placed on all new oil and gas fields and the government focus its efforts on supporting the transition to a low carbon economy, both domestically and internationally.” Within the next few weeks, the Committee on Climate Change, the statutory advisory body to the government on the climate crisis, will deliver its verdict on whether new exploration and exploitation in the North Sea can be compatible with the UK’s carbon budgets. Last year, in a report commissioned by the UK for Cop26, the International Energy Agency advised that no new fossil fuel exploration and development should take place from this year if the world was to stay within 1.5C. A research paper from UCL, published in the peer-review journal Nature, reached similar conclusions. Tessa Khan, the director of Uplift, said: “If we carry on down this path, we’ll be dependent on a very expensive, highly polluting energy source for decades longer than necessary. A serious response from the government to both unaffordable energy bills and the climate crisis would see all this investment steered into cheaper UK renewables.” The new round of North Sea oil and gas licensing, first announced last year, is an embarrassment for the government as it tries to cement the achievements of the Cop26 summit, held in Glasgow last November. The UK, as host, retains the presidency of the UN talks until this November, when Cop27 will take place in Egypt. That gives the government primary responsibility for ensuring the key promise made in Glasgow – that all of the world’s nations, and especially the G20 group of leading economies, would review their national emissions-cutting plans in line with a 1.5C temperature limit – is met. But rows within the Conservative party and in the media over the UK’s net zero target, which some backbench Tory MPs have attackedand which some commentators have claimed should be scrapped amid the energy price crisis, have overshadowed the UK’s continuing presidency and threaten to undermine the legacy of the talks. Alok Sharma, the president of Cop26 and a cabinet minister, last month told Sky News it was “not realistic” to think new North Sea sources would reduce gas prices and said: “What we need to be doing is more of what we have been doing, which is building forward on renewables and obviously investing in nuclear.” The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) is consulting on setting out a “climate compatibility checkpoint” that any new licence would have to pass. A spokesperson for BEIS said: “There will continue to be ongoing demand for oil and gas over the coming years as we transition to cleaner, more secure forms of energy generated in this country. As the business secretary has said, turning off our domestic source of gas overnight would put energy security, British jobs and industries at risk, and we would be even more dependent on foreign imports.” About half a dozen field development plans were given consent last year, with a similar number likely this year.",News/Environment,New North Sea oil and gas licences ‘incompatible with UK climate goals’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/15/new-north-sea-oil-gas-licences-incompatible-uk-climate-goals
