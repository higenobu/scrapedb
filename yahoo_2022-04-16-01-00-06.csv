4/16/2022,"(Reuters) -Russia has confirmed the Moskva missile cruiser, the flagship of its Black Sea Fleet, has sunk while being towed to port following what it said was a fire and explosions involving ammunition stowed onboard. Ukraine says the Moskva's fate was sealed by a missile strike launched by its forces from the coast which ripped open the hulking Soviet-era ship's hull. Russia's defence ministry has not confirmed that version of events. Reuters is unable to verify either side's assertions. Here's what we do know, and what the sinking means (and does not mean) for Russia's battle-readiness: WHAT CAPABILITIES DOES THE SINKING DEPRIVE RUSSIA OF? Russia has powerful air defence systems deployed in Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, but the Moskva was able to provide long-range and mobile air defence protection for the entire Black Sea Fleet and was a floating command and control centre. Its loss degrades the fleet's air defences, particularly on longer range missions. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CREW? The ship had a crew of around 500 sailors who Russia said were successfully evacuated to other ships before being returned to their home port of Sevastopol in Crimea on Friday. Ukraine has suggested there are likely to have been fatalities, but Russia has not said anything on the subject yet. WILL IT LOSS CHANGE THE COURSE OF THE UKRAINE CONFLICT? Unlikely to, but Britain's Ministry of Defence says its loss is likely to prompt Russia to review its naval posture in the Black Sea. U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that while the sinking would have a symbolic impact and potentially raise questions about Russia's longer-term naval capabilities, it would be unlikely to have a major impact on the course of the conflict. The Russian navy has so far not played a big role. One U.S. official said that Russia had only used its warships in a limited fashion, to carry out occasional strikes and resupply troops in the south. Russia retains naval dominance in the immediate region and the Moskva was equipped to destroy enemy vessels at sea but little is left of Ukraine's navy. WILL RUSSIA'S NAVY NOW CHANGE THE WAY IT OPERATES AND DOES THAT MATTER? Yes it will, but that change is not seen as being hugely significant. After the fire on the Moskva started, which U.S. officials believe was likely a Ukrainian attack, about five Russian warships in the northern part of the Black Sea moved further away from the coast, about 80 nautical miles. But U.S. officials said they believed those ships were still capable of carrying out strikes into Ukraine from that distance and were less likely to be targeted by the Ukrainians that far away from the coast. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based think tank, said the Ukrainian military’s ability to hit Russian warships in the Black Sea could force the Russian Navy to deploy additional air defence and other assets for protection. WAS THE MOSKVA EARMARKED FOR A ROLE IN THE UNFOLDING CONFLICT? Not clear, but some analysts say it may have helped support a possible Russian amphibious landing in the Ukrainian port of Odesa that has not happened yet because of resistance from Ukrainian forces. Its sinking may be seen in some quarters in Ukraine as reducing the chances of such an assault and allow Ukraine to redeploy some of its forces elsewhere. CAN RUSSIA EASILY REPLACE THE MOSKVA'S CAPABILITIES No. Russia has two other ships of the same class, the Marshal Ustinov and the Varyag, which serve with Russia's Northern and Pacific fleets respectively. Turkey, which controls access to the Black Sea via the Bosphorus, will not let them enter at a time of war. WAS THE MOSKVA ARMED WITH UNIQUE WEAPONS? No. It had anti-ship missiles and surface-to-air missiles, but was not equipped with Russia's latest generation Kalibr cruise missiles or hypersonic missiles. HOW MODERN A SHIP WAS IT? Not very. Designed in the 1970s Soviet Union during the Cold War, it was conceived to destroy U.S. aircraft carriers and had been in service for nearly four decades. It underwent an extensive refit, and according to Britain's Ministry of Defence, only returned to operational status in 2021. Despite that refit, some of its hardware remained outdated. HOW BIG A BLOW TO RUSSIAN MILITARY PRIDE IS THE SINKING? It's a bitter loss for the Russian military as the ship, though ageing, was a symbol of the Crimea-based Black Sea Fleet and of Russian military pride. If it was holed by Ukrainian anti-ship missiles, it would be the biggest Russian warship to be lost in action since 1941, when German dive bombers crippled the Soviet battleship Marat in Kronshtadt harbour. The sinking, whether by Ukrainian missile strikes or through a mishap, “is a major propaganda victory for Ukraine,” said an assessment by the ISW. Western diplomats and experts expect senior officers in the Black Sea Fleet to lose their jobs over the sinking.

4/16/2022,"MIAMI (AP) — A U.S. ban on seafood imports from Russia over its invasion of Ukraine was supposed to sap billions of dollars from Vladimir Putin’s war machine. But shortcomings in import regulations mean that Russian-caught pollock, salmon and crab are likely to enter the U.S. anyway, by way of the country vital to seafood supply chains across the world: China. Like the U.S. seafood industry, Russian companies rely heavily on China to process their catch. Once there, the seafood can be re-exported to the U.S. as a “product of China” because country of origin labeling isn’t required. The result is that nearly a third of the wild-caught fish imported from China is estimated to have been caught in Russian waters, according to an International Trade Commission study of 2019 data. For pollock and sockeye salmon, the rate is even higher — 50% to 75%. “China doesn’t catch cod. They don’t catch pollock. But yet, they’re one of the largest exporters of these whitefish in the world,” said Sally Yozell, a former policy director at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who now is a senior fellow at the Stimson Center in Washington. “Having it labeled as a Chinese product is really not fair to the consumers and to restaurants.” ___ This story was supported by funding from the Walton Family Foundation. The AP is solely responsible for all content. ___ Fishing is big business in Russia, one closely linked to the Kremlin and Putin’s projection of power at sea. The country is the one of the world's top seafood producers and was the eighth-largest exporter to the U.S. last year, with more than $1.2 billion worth of sales, the bulk of it king crab. But it's unknown exactly how much manages to land in the U.S. by way of China, which sent another $1.7 billion in fish to the U.S. last year. Nor does the Biden administration’s ban require companies importing from China to find out. Among Russia’s biggest seafood exports is Alaska pollock. A cousin of cod, Alaska pollock is the most harvested fish in the U.S., showing up in everything from imitation crabmeat to McDonald’s Filet-O-Fish. Every year, giant, floating factories in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska with dozens of workers aboard catch 1.5 million metric tons of the fish, the equivalent of more than four times the weight of the Empire State Building. But the same species is also harvested in Russia in similar amounts. Even though the U.S. forbids the use of the name “Alaska pollock” if the fish wasn’t caught in U.S. waters, pollock caught by Russia and processed in China is hard to detect and fills an important gap in the U.S. market. Complicating matters further, a small share of the U.S. catch is also sent to China for processing and reimported to the U.S. In lieu of seafood tracing, U.S. producers rely on the name recognition of Alaska pollock to signal where the fish was caught. “Consumers can have confidence that if the name Alaska is on the box it unequivocally comes from Alaskan waters,” insisted Craig Morris, chief executive of Genuine Alaska Pollock Producers. Even before the invasion of Ukraine, pressure had been building to prevent what Sen. Dan Sullivan, a Republican of Alaska, called “authoritarian” pollock from entering the U.S. Putin banned U.S. seafood in 2014 following American sanctions to punish him for the invasion of Crimea that year. Since then Russian exports entering the U.S. duty free have nearly quadrupled in value. U.S. trade data analyzed by The Associated Press show that the biggest importer of Russian-caught pollock from China last year was High Liner Foods, whose shares are traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Other big importers include Gloucester, Massachusetts-based F.W. Bryce, a subsidiary of Japanese seafood conglomerate Nissui; Miami-based Quirch Foods; and Newport, Rhode Island-based Endeavor Seafood, whose founding partner, Todd Clark, served until 2020 as chairman of the National Fisheries Institute, the industry’s main lobby group. None of the companies responded to requests for comment about whether they would stop purchasing pollock from China or take steps to ensure it is not of Russian origin — neither of which is required by the seafood embargo. Gavin Gibbons, a spokesman for the National Fisheries Institute, said that almost all of the group’s members are now reviewing their sourcing practices. But some fear an outright ban on third-party processed seafood could lead to job losses in the U.S. and add to inflation, already the highest in decades. “The need to hold Russia accountable for its reprehensible actions in Ukraine is undeniable,” said Gibbons. “We support a strong and smart response that is targeted and avoids unnecessary economic collateral damage on U.S. workers.” While overshadowed by Russia’s role as an energy powerhouse, Russia’s seafood industry has increasingly been flexing its own muscle with strong support from the Kremlin. Two of the country’s largest seafood exporters — Vladivostok-based Russian Fishery Co. and Russian Crab — are owned by Gleb Frank, the son of Putin’s former transportation minister and head of state-owned shipbuilder Sovcomflot. Frank is also the son-in law of one of Russia’s richest men, Gennady Timchenko, who was among the first oligarchs sanctioned following the 2014 invasion of Crimea. The 39-year-old Frank was dubbed Russia’s “Crab King” after emerging in 2019 as the biggest beneficiary of a government plan to auction fishing quotas that had traditionally been handed out based on the previous year’s catch. With generous state loans, his companies have been at the forefront of an effort to renew Russia’s aging fleet. Last year, during a Navy Day ceremony at a St. Petersburg shipyard with Putin and 50 warships looking on, he launched an advanced supertrawler capable of hauling 60,000 tons of pollock per year. “Today the Russian navy has everything it needs to defend our homeland, our national interests,” Putin said in a speech in front of a monument to the fleet's founder, Peter the Great. “We can locate any enemy, whether they’re on, under or above the water. And if required, deal them an unavoidable strike.” One of Frank’s biggest competitors, Oleg Khan, fled into exile after a criminal investigation for murder was reopened around the same time Frank busted onto the seafood scene. Later, a company connected to him had its offices in Russia's Far East raided and assets seized over allegations of tax fraud and crab smuggling. Last month, after Frank himself was hit with U.S. sanctions along with his wife and father-in-law again, he sold part of his ownership stakes in both seafood companies to several associates and resigned as chairman. Russian Fishery Co. did not respond to a detailed list of questions about the U.S. embargo but Russian Crab said Frank has never played a role in management of the company. It’s not just the industry’s ties to the Kremlin that are driving concern. For years, activists have complained about Russia’s poor record caring for the oceans. The country was ranked No. 2 out of 152 nations in a recent study of global efforts to combat illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing prepared by consulting firm Poseidon and the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime. Only China scored worse. Allegations of illegal fishing have even followed Russia to the south pole, where a Russian ship in 2020 was accused of faking its location data to fish illegally off season. A Russian observer was also found to be behind anomalous catch data from several Antarctic fishing vessels. In both cases, Russia denied any wrongdoing. At a congressional hearing this month on the Russian seafood ban, Rep. Jared Huffman, a California Democrat, led calls for the expansion of NOAA’s Seafood Import Monitoring Program, which aims to prevent illegal seafood from entering U.S. supply chains by tracking shipments from the point of catch. Currently the program covers just 13 species, only two of which — red king crab and Atlantic cod — are fished by Russia. “Until that happens, Russian seafood will continue to line grocery store shelves and American consumers will continue to unwittingly support Putin’s war machine,” Huffman said. But some worry further isolation of Russia's seafood industry could backfire and slow important reform efforts driven by demand from Western consumers to know the origins of the fish on their plates. Peter Quinter, a former U.S. Customs Service attorney, said that the Biden administration can easily close the China loophole by requiring importers to inspect their supply chains to make sure none of their fish comes from Russia. He cited as a model recent legislation requiring retailers to obtain certification from the U.S. government that their goods were not produced using forced labor by Uyghur Muslims in China’s Xinjiang province. “They can and should fix this,” said Quinter, who now advises seafood companies on compliance with American trade law. “The old days of being sure your fish is caught in a single place or country is no longer the case.” ___ Wieffering reported from Washington.

4/16/2022,"You’ll see them cruising the streets on any busy night in Myrtle Beach — “Carolina Squat” trucks, tricked out with undercarriage lights and modified mufflers to make them louder, often blaring even louder music. But their true defining feature is their signature lean, the front end of the truck raised much higher than the back end. Many people, from locals to tourists to police and now lawmakers, despise these Carolina Squat trucks for causing a ruckus and, more severely, believe they pose a safety hazard to others on the road. Because the trucks are angled toward the sky, opponents argue, the truck drivers’ view of the road must be impaired; there’s a risk they could hit a pedestrian or another vehicle without ever seeing them. Owners of the trucks believe those concerns are overblown. They can see the road just as well as anyone else, the argument goes. Government officials and lawmakers, however, don’t really believe them. In just a few weeks, South Carolina could be the latest state to pass a law banning the vast majority of Carolina Squat trucks. North Carolina banned them last year. Virginia banned them last month. “I’ve seen several instances where the wheels have literally run off these vehicles,” North Carolina state Rep. Brenden Jones, who owns a used car dealership in Tabor City and sponsored his state’s ban on the trucks, told The News & Observer last May. The debate over whether the trucks deserve to be on South Carolina’s roads represents the latest battle in the war between “personal freedom” and “public safety.” Opponents of the trucks, seem to have the upper hand, with legislation to severely restrict the trucks moving steadily toward becoming law. Lawmakers and police interviewed for this story say they don’t care about the flashier elements Carolina Squat trucks are known for — the bright lights, the loud music, the noisy engines. Their two main concerns: Visibility and the heightened potential for catastrophic damage and injury in a crash. The Myrtle Beach Police Department, which testified before the South Carolina Senate in favor of a bill to heavily restrict the trucks, tested out a few different heights on one of their own Chevrolet Tahoes. They used their public information officer, Tom Vest, and his 6-year-old son as reference points. With no lift on a truck, both Vest and his son were almost entirely visible, standing about 15 feet in front of the vehicle. But with a truck’s front end lifted 4 inches higher than its back, a little over half of Vest was visible, and one-third of his son. At a 5-inch differential, Vest’s son all but disappeared from view, with just his hair showing. Many Carolina Squat trucks, however, have height differentials of 10, 12 or even 20 inches. Vest said their example showed how easy it could be for a Carolina Squat truck to hit a pedestrian without ever seeing them. Last summer, a pedestrian was killed in Myrtle Beach after being hit by Carolina Squat truck. Myrtle Beach Police presented that incident to lawmakers when testifying in favor of the bill to restrict the trucks. “The pedestrian, rather than striking the front of the vehicle and rolling off, was actually caught underneath the car and was killed,” Vest said. I’m on 29th Avenue North in Myrtle Beach where officials with MBPD say there was a traffic collision involving a pedestrian. That person was sent to the hospital with life-threatening injuries according to officials. @wpdeabc15 pic.twitter.com/2gEm7m2Wqr — Annette Montgomery (@AnnettemTV) June 30, 2021 Another concern is the increased hazard Carolina Squat trucks present in the event of a collision, government officials said. Most automobiles, Vest said, are designed to meet bumper-to-bumper when colliding. That design allows the cars to distribute the force of the crash and reduce impact on the passengers of either vehicle, he said. Most of the damage to the cars will be restricted to the sides, where there is more metal to take the impact. With Carolina Squat trucks, however, the truck might simply drive right over another car, Vest said. Or, the truck’s front bumper might crash into the back windows of the other car. In example of those concerns playing out on the road was when a Virginia man named Jody “BJ” Upton died in February after a head-on-collision with a Carolina Squat truck. When Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed his state’s law banning the trucks, Upton’s family was present. “Nothing can bring BJ back, but with faith, time and love we can begin to heal from the pain of losing him,” Youngkin said in a statement the day of the bill signing. For pedestrians, the danger is that the person will be sucked under the vehicle and possibly even run over, injuring them more than if they had been hit directly by the car’s front end, Vest said. That’s what happened to the Myrtle Beach pedestrian who was hit and killed by one of the trucks last summer. “The reality is, if you modify a vehicle with an extreme difference between the front and the back, it absolutely makes it more difficult to see what’s in front of you,” Vest said. “That’s why those trucks don’t come from the factory like that.” Shane Wilson has one overriding thought on the efforts to ban Carolina Squat trucks. “This is b------t,” he said. Wilson, who lives in Orangeburg, has had six Carolina Squat trucks. He owns two currently. He sold the first four after getting bored with them and wanting to build new ones. He’s been building them “since I’ve had a driver’s license” — about five years. One of his trucks, a red 2007 Chevrolet Silverado, has an 11-inch lift in the front and is lowered 2 inches in the rear. “To a certain point, yes. I think that they are a danger (when) people overdo it,” Wilson said, calling lift differentials of 20 or more inches excessive. “But 90% of the time, they just mess with us just because they don’t like it. I can see perfectly fine in my truck the way it sits.” If the Carolina Squat bill working its way through the State House were passed in its current form, Wilson’s truck would be illegal to drive on South Carolina roads. The bill would restrict the front-to-back-end differential for all trucks to just 4 inches. That’s the level Vest said allows drivers some freedom of expression without risking anyone else’s safety. “One of the things that’s kind of a misconception is that it bans the modification completely,” Vest said. “That’s not true. You can still express yourself with modifications to a vehicle as long as it’s within safe guidelines.” Wilson, who works with his father and grandfather on the trucks and has a cohort of friends who drive them, said restricting the trucks to 4 inches would make them barely noticeable compared to anything else on the road. Wilson said it feels like government officials have a vendetta against the Carolina Squat trucks because they are loud, both in noise and appearance. He pointed to the Myrtle Beach Truck Week, which was canceled this year after being told by the city officials that it could no longer be held outside the Myrtle Beach Convention Center. The event normally happens during the spring or summer. “We never want to give bad news. Unfortunately there will not be a MBTW2022,” Myrtle Beach Truck Week said in a post on its Facebook page in January. “Due to changes in the City of Myrtle Beach we are not able to continue hosting shows at the Myrtle Beach Convention Center. For now we will be suspending 2022 activities and reevaluating for the future to bring y’all another show. We hope that you understand and continue to support us.” The city, however, said it had nothing to do with trying to stop the show altogether. City spokesman Mark Kruea said the truck show was no longer allowed to happen at the Convention Center because the property isn’t “set up to host outdoor events” because of the lack of restrooms, concessions and other necessary facilities. The other problem, Kruea said, is outdoor events take up parking that might need to be used for other events happening indoors at the Convention Center, for example. Canceling the event won’t stop anything for Carolina Squat truck enthusiasts, Wilson said. There are plans to meet down in Myrtle Beach sometime this summer for an informal gathering, he said. Wilson said he and other truck owners have to deal with regular harassment from people who hate the trucks. It’s not hard to find discussions online with people throwing expletive-laden barbs for why they think the Carolina Squat should be banned. “To begin with, I thought it was cool,” he said. “The reason I still do it is just to not give the people what they want.” Senate Bill 908, proposing the restrictions on Carolina Squat truck modifications, is halfway through the South Carolina Legislature on its way to becoming law. It was passed by the Senate in February. It now awaits a hearing in the House Labor, Commerce and Industry committee. State Rep. William Bailey, R-Horry County, will be the first to say he hates restricting what people can do with their own property, with their own money. But he said he draws the line when those actions present a danger to others. “I don’t think our goal is to impact their right to be able to do whatever they want to do with their own personal property,” Bailey said. “Our intention is to make sure that the vehicle is safe when you’re adding other people into the mix.” Bailey said he’s seen the damage these trucks can cause up close. One of his neighbors was hit by one, destroying the back half of his Toyota Camry. Bailey said it was because the truck accelerated and didn’t notice the Camry in front. “You’re sitting at a stoplight, you get a little closer than you do in typical traffic,” Bailey said. “Your sight is obstructed, and you accelerate because you’re listening to the radio or got your mind somewhere else or your phone rings, and next thing you know you’re over the top of a vehicle. “It could be a pedestrian just as easy as a vehicle.” State Sen. Larry Grooms, R-Berkeley, said that right before a phone call with a reporter he saw “one of the worst offenders” he’d ever seen among Carolina Squat trucks. The driver “had to be leaning over the steering wheel” to see, Grooms said. “You can’t drive drunk because you’re impaired,” said Grooms, a co-sponsor of S. 908. “And when it comes to vehicle design, you can’t jack your vehicle up so that you can’t see the highway because you will endanger the lives of others — taking away their freedom and their ability to have quiet enjoyment of their life.” Every time he passes a Carolina Squat truck, Grooms says one thought always goes through his mind. “They’re about to kill someone if they can’t see the road,” he said. “The vehicle, I just passed no more 15 minutes ago, I noticed the driver was having a difficult time, even looking left and right before he pulled out onto a major U.S. highway. “In customizing his vehicle and expressing his antics and expressing his freedom, he’s now endangering the lives of others.” The bill still has to make it through the House, and time is running out. The legislative session ends in early May. Grooms said even if the bill doesn’t get passed this year, he has “no doubt it will become law at some point.” “It’s my hope that it will be done before anyone else loses their life or their liberty or impaired physically because of it,” Grooms said. Bailey said he is confident the bill will be addressed in the coming weeks, adding that there is “tremendous support” for the bill in the House. “I think in the long run, it’s going to be something that encourages people to come to our area (and) makes them feel safe,” Bailey said. The trucks are not exclusive to Myrtle Beach. They exist all over the state. The Chamber of Commerce in Florence, host of several car shows in the area, did not have any comment on whether Carolina Squat trucks should be banned; neither did the Charleston Metro Chamber of Commerce. Even if S. 908 becomes law, Wilson said he’s not giving up. Instead, he’ll just switch to an airbag system that allows him to raise his truck to a level height when driving and lower it when he wants to show off or attends a car show. “Leave us alone and let us do it,” Wilson said. “You can put a limit on it, but it shouldn’t be just 4 inches.” Vest, for his part, said he doesn’t mind that. “It’s about safety on the roadways,” Vest said.",U.S./Myrtle Beach Sun News,Carolina Squat truck owners say ‘leave us alone.’ Why SC might ban trucks some see as menace,https://news.yahoo.com/carolina-squat-truck-owners-leave-090000731.html
