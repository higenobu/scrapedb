4/15/2022,"Prince Harry and Meghan have visited the Queen at Windsor Castle on their way to the Invictus Games. The couple were travelling to The Hague in the Netherlands for the games, which begin on Saturday, and on Thursday visited the UK together for the first time since stepping down as senior working royals more than two years ago. It is understood the Duke and Duchess of Sussex also met with Prince Charles. The visit comes after Harry was absent from Prince Philip’s memorial service in London last month. The duke is in the process of bringing a claim against the Home Office after being told he would no longer receive the same level of personal protective security when visiting from the US, despite offering to pay for it himself. Prince Harry wants to bring his children to visit, but he and his family are “unable to return to his home” because it is too dangerous, his legal representative has said. However, Dai Davies, a former head of royal protection at Scotland Yard, told PA Media this week that Harry is “not an expert in security”. “The truth is I have no doubt that he will be protected, whether he takes his own team or whether the Dutch authorities give him some kind of VIP status,” he said, referring to the likely security arrangements in The Hague. “The truth is, if there’s a risk both countries – ours and the Netherlands – have sophisticated systems of determining risk. “This country has determined he is no longer at risk. That may or may not be true, but people far better qualified than I am now can make that decision and they never make it lightly.” Harry and Meghan chose to make their first public appearance together at the Invictus Games almost five years ago. The duke founded the games to give military veterans the challenge of competing in sporting events similar to the Paralympics.

4/15/2022,"The prospect of makeshift beds, campfire cuisine and long-drop loos used to be a turn-off for holidaymakers but new research underlines the scale of the domestic camping boom during Covid, as millions have swapped foreign sun loungers for s’mores and sleeping bags. One in five British adults have been on a camping or caravan holiday since the pandemic began, according to market researchers Mintel. Of these about 4.5 million were sleeping in a tent or caravan for the first time, it estimated. With overseas trips often out of reach, spending on these kinds of trips surged to £2.7bn in 2021. That was nearly 80% more than in 2020 when lockdowns decimated travel plans. The affordability of these types of holidays is traditionally the main attraction but the pandemic saw an influx of more affluent families on campsites, Mintel said. Almost four in 10 “Covid campers” had a household income above £50,000, compared with about a fifth of those who camped or caravanned pre-crisis. “Many of these customers are likely to have substituted planned holidays abroad for staycations,” said John Worthington, Mintel’s senior travel analyst – and it remains to be seen if they will go again as overseas travel opens up, albeit against the backdrop of a cost of living crisis. The “rising cost of living crisis has the potential to dampen consumer spending on all holiday types”, he said. “Camping and caravanning, however, hold the advantage of being seen as an affordable holiday. Our research shows that ‘low cost’ is seen as the leading attraction for consumers.” He added that this part of the holiday market had prospered before when people were encountering financial hardship, such as during the 2009 recession, when they traded more expensive trips abroad for budget domestic holidays. “In the short-term, the cost of living crisis might bring in those with tighter household budgets who are cutting back on more expensive holidays, including a potential trip abroad,” said Worthington. Organisations such as the Camping and Caravanning Club are among the groups to have reported strong bookings before the Easter getaway suggesting Britons, who have invested thousands pounds in a caravan or other holiday vehicles, including motorhomes and converted vans, are eager to use them again. Last year dealerships struggled to get their hands on enough vans as a growing number of under-40s, including new dog owners, bought homes on wheels. Britons also bought large quantities of camping supplies, almost cleaning out specialist stores ahead of the summer holidays.",News/Business,"British camping holidays boom in pandemic, figures show",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/15/british-camping-caravanning-holidays-boom-pandemic-mintel
4/15/2022,"A musical drama about the life of John Hume, one of the main forces behind the Good Friday agreement, will be staged next year to mark the 25th anniversary of the historic deal that helped end 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland. Beyond Belief, written by Damian Gorman with music by Brian O’Doherty, is the second part of a “peace-building trilogy” at the Playhouse in Hume’s home town, Derry, after The White Handkerchief, a play about the events of Bloody Sunday, earlier this year. Mo Hume, the late politician’s daughter, said the play would “present his life and work with great integrity but also joy. My father’s career had many triumphs, many hardships, but he was a warm, kind and funny family man, a man who loved to sing. He was a very proud Derry man.” Hume’s family and the John and Pat Hume Foundation are supporting the production. Hume – the leader of the Northern Irish nationalist party the SDLP for more than 20 years, a Westminster MP and a member of the European parliament – helped persuade the IRA to give up its armed struggle. He argued that nationalists and unionists needed to share power and pursue their goals by peaceful, democratic means. After the Good Friday agreement was signed on 10 April 1998, with the UK prime minister Tony Blair declaring the “hand of history is upon our shoulder”, Hume and the Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble were jointly awarded the Nobel peace prize. Brid Rodgers, a former SDLP deputy leader and a friend of Hume’s, said: “A lot of people think of John Hume as a figure in history; not many know the real, human John Hume. As well as being an innovator, motivator and inspiring a generation, he was good fun. No party was ever complete without John singing.” The drama will show Hume at his strongest and his weakest, said its director, Kieran Griffiths. Hume had dementia towards the end of his life. “When he was most vulnerable, he’d sometimes be lost in his own city. People in Derry would gently take his arm and see him home, without any sense of shaming.” Griffiths added: “His relationship with his wife, Pat, is crucial – they were a joint force. In a very simple sense, Beyond Belief is a love story.” When Hume died in August 2020, Covid restrictions meant there could be only a small funeral. “People were robbed of the chance to say a proper goodbye. I’m hoping the play will give the community and the wider diaspora a chance to lay their hands on him.” In recent years, the power-sharing arrangements set up under the Good Friday agreement have been periodically in jeopardy. Rodgers said: “This drama will remind people what’s at stake, what John was trying to achieve and how important it is that it endures.”  Beyond Belief: The Life and Mission of John Hume will be at the Derry Playhouse from 31 March-7 April 2023, with the final performance broadcast live.

4/15/2022,"It has been a physically and emotionally draining week for Manchester City. Pep Guardiola says City are “in big trouble” due to injuries picked up in their triumphant draw at the Wanda Metropolitano after Kevin De Bruyne and Kyle Walker were forced off. Phil Foden spent most of the game sporting a bandaged head after a needlessly robust challenge from Felipe. Although some rejigging will be required for the second meeting with Liverpool in a week, the real challenge for Guardiola will be to refresh the team mentally for another season-defining match. The level of focus required at the Etihad on Sunday and in Spain on Wednesday will have been incredibly challenging for the players, many of whom played in both. An FA Cup semi-final is the kind of contest to sharpen the mind, although there will be no rest after. City face two games a week until mid-May so need to manage their bodies and minds carefully for the foreseeable. There can be no slip-ups. WU Manchester City v Liverpool, Saturday 4.30pm (all times BST) Those hoping the Liverpool-City rivalry might add a dimension of seething contempt to make it more fun for the neutral may get their wish through familiarity. Just six days since a match that had Alan Shearer and even Roy Keane drooling over footballing artistry, Wembley’s wide-open spaces and the prospective trebles and quadruples at stake might just add the requisite tension. Chuck in a heavy foul here and a questionable refereeing decision there, and the pot might just boil over. Not that Jürgen Klopp is likely to follow the Diego Simeone playbook: his focus is always on getting the best from his team rather than dragging the opposition down. While he may hand roles to Harvey Elliott and Roberto Firmino, benched last week, Caoimhin Kelleher – despite his Wembley heroics – is unlikely to be goalkeeper, Alisson having played in the quarter-final win at Nottingham Forest. The Brazilian’s expected presence reflects the competition’s importance to his manager. JB Antonio Rüdiger’s post-match rage achieved instant meme status as Chelsea exited the Champions League. The German’s uncharacteristic slip had allowed Real Madrid’s Karim Benzema to steal in for the header that decided the tie. Madrid is one possible destination for a player whose contract expires at the end of the season as time ticks down on the team funded by Roman Abramovich. César Azpilicueta’s contract extension may have been triggered recently but that may not preclude his departure and he, Rüdiger and Andreas Christensen are all linked with Barcelona, where free transfers are being used to rebuild. Were Abramovich still around, Thomas Tuchel’s future would almost certainly be in question but the four consortia bidding to buy the Russian’s frozen stake in the club all appear to recognise his popularity with fans. Now the Champions League defence has gone, reaching the FA Cup final would allow the Abramovich era a send-off on a grand stage. JB Chelsea v Crystal Palace, Sunday 4.30pm Football is full of silly rules that help the bigger clubs hold power over the smaller ones. For example, Crystal Palace midfielder Conor Gallagher cannot play in an FA Cup semi-final despite helping his team through each round to Wembley, purely because he is owned by Chelsea, a club that let him leave in the summer as they did not want to use him. They will not permit him to play. If Chelsea are willing to loan out a player, they should do so at their own risk. Gallagher has been a standout performer all season for Patrick Vieira, the manager helping improve him as a player, giving him experience and increasing his value. All of which help Chelsea in the long run. If Gallagher had been allowed to play and scored the winner for Palace, that is a danger Chelsea should have had to live with. Surely the point of sending Gallagher out is for him to experience big occasions and deal with them? WU Antonio Conte’s revamped and revitalised front three are earning plaudits as Spurs make a timely charge for fourth spot, but further back a foundation is being laid. Eric Dier has settled at the heart of a disciplined back three that has conceded five times in the past seven Premier League games (three of those came at Old Trafford). While Harry Maguire struggles at Manchester United, Dier is looking like an international footballer once again and should add to his 45 England caps in the near future. He may be the best English centre-back in the Premier League on current form. Gareth Southgate likes to play with three centre-backs, so Dier seems an obvious choice. He is playing in the most successful club version of the same formation and the Nations League fixtures take place in June. Dier has already made 28 Premier League appearances this season; the last time he made more was in 2017-18, a sign he is finding greater consistency. WU Tottenham v Brighton, Saturday 12.30pm David de Gea, Juan Mata and Phil Jones are the survivors from the last Manchester United team to lose to Norwich, a 2-1 Canaries win at Old Trafford in December 2015. That team ended the Premier League season in fifth place, where the current United are sixth with very little chance of climbing to fourth. Louis van Gaal paid for fifth with his sacking. While Ralf Rangnick’s role was only temporary, United’s slump, taking in his inability to arrest Maguire’s decline or answer the Cristiano Ronaldo question, means his credibility as a future consultant to the owners has been marked down. Rangnick’s response to last week’s defeat at Everton was shrugging detachment, and he has also hinted he played no part in the recruitment of a new manager, expected to be Erik ten Hag. The German is hardly alone in becoming a spare part amid United’s fall from grace. Such dysfunction is now part of the package. JB Manchester United v Norwich, Saturday 3pm “I understand that we will never be best friends,” was how Granit Xhaka described his relationship with Arsenal fans in a Players’ Tribune piece published on Wednesday. “I want you to know that whatever I do on the pitch, it comes from the right place.” That Xhaka has not lived up to expectations since his arrival from Borussia Mönchengladbach in the summer of 2016 is true. He is notorious for some injudicious tackling, and a confrontation with home supporters in 2019. But he has also been backed by each of Arsène Wenger, Unai Emery and Mikel Arteta and is an idol back home in Switzerland, where there is bemusement at such pariah status. At St Mary’s, with Kieran Tierney out for the season and Nuno Tavares struggling to settle, it is likely Xhaka will be asked to reprise the left-back role he was given against Brighton last week. Such adaptability is what senior players offer their managers. JB Southampton v Arsenal, Saturday 3pm This week saw Watford’s board confirm their commitment to staying at Vicarage Road, the expansion to the current 22,000 capacity a case of “when, not if”. There had been talk of moving to a purpose-built stadium at Bushey Hall Golf Club with a capacity of 33,000, but that appears at its end. On its day the old place, its corners now all closed off, can give off a buzzy, fun atmosphere and is pleasingly close enough to the town centre, unlike many new stadia. Unfortunately, its chances of staying a Premier League ground are low, and mostly down to the team’s ruinous home form. Roy Hodgson’s record of seven losses in 11 matches includes a total blank at Vicarage Road. Watford last won there against Manchester United on 20 November, losing every home game since. The likelihood of Saturday staging the latest chapter of Christian Eriksen’s Brentford fable seems high. JB Watford v Brentford, Saturday 3pm Ryan Fraser’s injury against Wolves allowed Miguel Almirón a chance off the Newcastle bench. The Paraguayan has only started 13 times in the Premier League this season but has an opportunity to cement a place for the run-in. Against Wolves he was tireless, proving he can do the defensive side of the game required by Eddie Howe, having previously been a free spirit. Almirón made a real difference going forward, too, helping to create a goal eventually ruled out by VAR. Almirón’s agent has visited the north-east recently to discuss the player’s future. . The playmaker should use the games ahead to show what he can offer Newcastle in the long term, starting with Leicester’s visit. There will be no shortage of new arrivals in the summer. WU Newcastle v Leicester, Sunday 2.15pm Wout Weghorst trudged off 11 minutes into the second half of Burnley’s defeat to Norwich last week. The Dutch international is supposed to be firing the Clarets to safety but has managed just one goal in 12 appearances since arriving in January. “I think – and it is a positive, but it is a strange thing to mention – Wout is almost too team-bound at the minute,” Sean Dyche said after the loss. Weghorst spent most of the game trying to control long balls and bring others into the game but it provided little to the team. Weghorst needs to be in the box to get on the end of quality crosses, something absent at Carrow Road. Burnley’s style is based on having a successful big striker. Without that their relegation may be confirmed far sooner than necessary.

4/15/2022,"The four groups trying to buy Chelsea face an anxious wait after lodging improved bids for the club on Thursday. The merits of each offer are being assessed by Roman Abramovich and the club’s board, and Raine, the American bank handling the sale, is expected to take a preferred bidder to the UK government for approval early next week. Raine’s input is likely to have an influence on the Chelsea hierarchy’s decision and it is believed that the highest bid will not necessarily be the successful one. Abramovich, who was hit with sanctions after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, is also expected to take into account the club’s future wellbeing. The Russian billionaire wants Chelsea, who could be sold for as much as £2.75bn, to be in good hands. The bidders all have a heavy background in American sports. They include a consortium led by the co-owner of the LA Dodgers, Todd Boehly, and one by the owners of the Chicago Cubs, Tom and Laura Ricketts. A consortium fronted by Sir Martin Broughton and Sebastian Coe has received backing from the owners of the Philadelphia 76ers basketball team, Josh Harris and David Blitzer. The fourth bid is led by the Boston Celtics’ co-owner, Steve Pagliuca. All four groups say their bids are cash only and will not load Chelsea with debt. Sources close to the process believe that a preferred bid could emerge after Monday. However there have been delays throughout and there could be no developments until the end of the next week. The Premier League will need to ensure each bidder will pass its fit and proper owners test, while the government’s main priority is ensuring that no money from the sale goes to Abramovich. The government will need to issue a licence for the sale to go through. At first glance Boehly’s bid appears to be the one with the least complications. He has partnered with his fellow Dodgers owner Mark Walter, the Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss and the London businessman Jonathan Goldstein. The group has backing from the investment firm Clearlake Capital. Sources have dismissed suggestions that Clearlake would take a majority shareholding. The Tory peer Daniel Finkelstein and the publicist Barbara Charone will become non-executive directors if Boehly’s bid wins. The Boehly group was the first to move when it became clear that Abramovich’s ownership could not continue. It would have been able to complete a takeover by now had Raine not decided to hold an auction. The other groups are firmly in contention, however. The Ricketts family have undeterred by Chelsea fans opposing their bid over historical accusations of Islamophobia. They have partnered with the hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin and Rock Entertainment Group, which is headed by Dan Gilbert, who is worth an estimated $31bn (£23.7bn). The Ricketts plan to add Karan Bilimoria, a Tory peer, Chelsea fan and the founder of Cobra Beer, to the board. Broughton and Lord Coe are also seen as viable owners, even though they have not named all the investors behind their group. Their bid is complicated by Harris and Blitzer owning stakes in Crystal Palace which they would need to sell to become shareholders at Chelsea. Pagliuca will need to reduce his shareholding in Atalanta if his bid is successful. He has been joined by the Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin and Elaine Andriejanssen, a businesswoman and Saverin’s wife, along with the chairman of the NBA, Larry Tanenbaum. Peter Guber, who owns part of the Dodgers with Boehly, is also involved with Pagliuca’s bid and there is backing from the former Disney chief executive Bob Iger, the B Capital co-founder Raj Ganguly, the venture capitalist Jim Breyer and entrepreneur Div Turakhia. The groups have been informed they must commit to investing at least £1bn in Chelsea’s infrastructure, academy and women’s team. The bidders all have plans to renovate Stamford Bridge. They will ant to give transfer backing to Thomas Tuchel, the manager of the men’s team, this summer.",Sport/Football,Chelsea bidders wait for news after submitting improved offers for club,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/15/chelsea-bidders-submit-improved-offers-for-club
4/15/2022,"Seven out of 10 teachers in England have considered resigning in the past year, with more than half citing pay as a key factor, according to a survey of teachers. More than half of those polled said they have been forced to cut back their spending on food, while one in 10 have taken on a second job and others have resorted to food banks and other charitable support. The NASUWT teachers’ union, which commissioned the survey of 11,000 teachers before its national conference in Birmingham over the Easter weekend, said there would be an “unprecedented recruitment and retention crisis” unless there was a significant pay rise. The government has promised to increase pay for newly qualified teachers in state schools, allowing starting salaries to rise from about £25,000 to £30,000 in 2024, meeting a commitment in the Conservative party’s 2019 election manifesto. But the pay rise will come at the expense of much lower increases for teachers with more than five years in the classroom, or in senior roles. Those teachers instead face a real-terms pay cut of 5% over the next two years, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Delegates at the NASUWT conference will debate a motion calling for possible industrial action if the government is unwilling to enter into discussions over teachers’ pay. Almost two-thirds of those who took part in the survey (64%) expressed anger over pay and said they felt they were being treated unfairly by the government. Only 1% said the felt teacher pay levels were about right. As the cost of living crisis begins to bite, nearly nine in 10 (89%) said they were either very worried or somewhat worried about their financial situation. Almost seven in 10 (68%) have cut back expenditure on clothes, nearly a quarter (24%) have either increased their use of credit or applied for a payday loan and more than a half (56%) have dipped into savings. Of those surveyed, 11% said they had taken a second job and just under 3% had resorted to food banks or other charitable assistance. Dr Patrick Roach, NASUWT general secretary, said: “Teachers across the UK, and at every stage of their career, are seriously questioning if they can afford to continue another year in the education profession without a pay uplift that meets the sky-rocketing cost of living. “The government has continuously failed to heed teachers’ warnings that the toll of 12 years of pay erosion and successive pay freezes can no longer be endured. Now we are living with the bleak reality of teachers having no choice but to seek second jobs, cut back on essential supplies such as food and even relying on the assistance of food banks.” Stephen Morgan, shadow schools minister, said Labour was committed to recruiting thousands of new teachers to fill vacancies. “Successive Conservative governments and two years of chaos during the pandemic have piled pressure on to school staff resulting in record numbers looking to leave our schools. “Investing in school staff is investing in children’s learning and development. In failing teachers, the Conservatives are failing our children.” The motion before conference this weekend says that “unless there is a significant pay rise and restructure for teachers, there will continue to be an enormous recruitment and retention problem in the teaching profession”. It adds: “Conference is concerned that we lose many teachers in the first five years of their careers and that teaching has to be an attractive profession against other graduate professions that rewards and celebrates experience through fair and equitable pay.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Our latest proposals on teacher pay set out how we will deliver a £30,000 starting salary for teachers by 2023/24, as well as the highest experienced teacher pay award since 2006 in 2022/23. “We understand that the rising cost of living is of concern to people across the country. We continue to balance rewarding teachers for their hard work – and attracting the brightest and the best into the profession – with a pay system that is appropriate and affordable for the taxpayer.”",News/Education,"Seven in 10 teachers in England thought of leaving in past year, poll shows",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/15/seven-in-10-teachers-in-england-thought-of-leaving-in-past-year-poll-shows
