1/4/2022,"The jury weighing fraud charges against Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes is unable to reach a unanimous verdict on three of the 11 criminal counts she faces, according to a note from the panel read aloud in court on Monday morning. Jurors had been deliberating for seven days after a 15-week trial that chronicled the missteps of the now-defunct blood testing startup.  Over the course of nearly four months, federal prosecutors called 29 witnesses, outlining missteps and alleged fraud Holmes committed during her 15-year reign as CEO. Holmes founded the company after dropping out of Stanford at 19, promising a revolutionary technology that could run hundreds of health tests on just a drop of blood. But the company ultimately fell short of its ambitious pledge. A charismatic character known for her blonde hair, uniform of black turtlenecks and low voice, Holmes quickly rose to fame in and outside the tech world, gracing the covers of major magazines, headlining conferences, and drawing comparisons to Apple’s Steve Jobs. As Theranos grew, the company attracted big-name investors including the former secretaries of state George Schultz and Henry Kissinger. At its height, Theranos was valued at more than $9bn.

1/4/2022,"There were 157,758 new Covid cases confirmed in England and Scotland in the past 24 hours, government data showed on Monday. Cases were up 50% in the week from 28 December and 3 January compared with the week before. Monday’s figures for Wales and Northern Ireland will be updated after the bank holiday.  The government said a further 42 people had died in England within 28 days of testing positive for Covid. Deaths last week were up 17% on the previous seven days. Last Wednesday there were 11,918 patients in hospital with Covid, 868 of whom were on beds with a mechanical ventilator. On Sunday another 12,121 people in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland received a first dose of Covid vaccine, 15,893 had a second dose and 106,665 had a booster or third dose. Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics show there have now been 174,000 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate.",News/World news,"UK Covid cases up 50% in a week as daily tally exceeds 150,000",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/uk-covid-cases-up-50-in-a-week-as-daily-tally-exceeds-150000
1/4/2022,"The family gatherings have disbanded, the new year’s hangovers have lifted. Despite record Covid infection figures over the holiday period, evidence that the rate of increase in cases may be slowing has prompted speculation that London, at least, may be close to reaching “peak Omicron”. Boris Johnson is said to be obsessed with this hypothetical time point, seeing it as crucial to how the Covid variant may play out nationwide. If hospitalisations follow the same trajectory and peak without the NHS being overwhelmed, the prime minister’s decision not to impose lockdown-style restrictions before the holiday period may be vindicated.  Johnson is correct that peak Omicron, when it comes, will be an important moment. “The reason it matters when it peaks – and particularly when cases peak in the over-50s – is it’s likely that a week later we’ll see the peak in hospitalisations, and roughly two weeks later, we’ll see a peak in the number of deaths. It’s helpful, because it helps us to plan ahead,” said Dr Raghib Ali, a senior clinical research associate at the University of Cambridge’s MRC epidemiology unit. In London, cases appear to have stabilised, or even fallen during the past two weeks. New hospitalisations also appear to have stabilised in recent days, with 319 people admitted with Covid-19 on 31 December, compared with 450 the day before, and 511 the day before that. “We would guess, based on what case numbers are doing in London, that the peak in hospital admissions should be this week, and nationally, maybe a week later,” Ali said. This is roughly in line with the scenarios outlined in modelling studies, which suggest Omicron cases will peak in early-mid January. However, the magnitude of the peak appears to be significantly lower than some of the worst case scenarios predicted. For instance, according to modelling data published by the University of Warwick on 30 December, hospital admissions should by now be approaching about 5,000 a day in England. Yet, according to the latest figures, the number of Covid-19 patients admitted on 1 January was 1,819, down from 2,370 three days earlier. This does not necessarily mean we should disregard such models, as some hawkish MPs have suggested. Ali said: “Modelling, post-vaccination has become extremely difficult. And trying to predict people’s behaviour, well, they don’t even try to include that in the models, so, inevitably, they’re not going to be able to predict what’s going to happen. “Instead, they give a variety of scenarios, which are necessary because we have to have some idea of the range of possibilities. But when the range is so wide, it doesn’t really help policymakers, because the difference between 100 deaths a day and 6,000 deaths a day is just so huge.” Although the gloomiest predictions may have not come to pass, experts caution that we are not out of the woods yet. Some of the slowing could be a reflection of altered behaviour in the run-up to Christmas, when concern about escalating Omicron cases and a desire to spend the festive period with older relatives prompted many to scale back social activities and behave more cautiously. They may also have been less likely to get tested in the run-up to Christmas – assuming they could access a test. Now Christmas is over, some of us may have relaxed our behaviour. Whether we will see a surge in cases as a result of new year’s celebrations will not become apparent for about another week, as it takes five to six days on average after exposure to the virus for symptoms to develop, and then a further couple of days for people to seek a test and receive the results. The return of children to schools this week – many of whom remain unvaccinated – may also lead to a surge in cases owing to increased mixing. Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: “The Warwick model suggested that cases would peak early January. But it is still impossible to say. We will probably only really know in retrospect a couple of weeks later. “What we can say is that the rate of increase has slowed dramatically for early mid-December, otherwise we would be seeing several millions of infections a day by now and that would have been impossible.” “Taking all this together, I don’t think we have peaked yet, but I think we are not that far away – or at least I hope so,” he added. A further fly in the ointment is that younger age groups accounted for the majority of Omicron cases during early-mid December, but increased intergenerational mixing over Christmas could yet trigger a surge of infections in older adults. Also, because Omicron is better at infecting people who have been vaccinated than Delta, proportionately more vulnerable older people are likely to fall ill. The good news is that most of these people have now received a booster dose, and their levels of immune protection should remain high for a few months yet – though we will not yet know whether they will require yet another dose. The ramped-up booster programme has been under way for several weeks, meaning many younger individuals should also soon have additional layer of immune protection, if not already. The combination of this vaccine-induced protection and so many people having been infected means we will eventually we will hit peak Omicron, after which cases should begin to fall. This will be cause for celebration, but for as long as significant numbers of people around the world remain unvaccinated, the global death toll from Covid will continue to rise, and the chances of further variants emerging will remain. So, although the battle with Omicron may be beginning to turn in the UK’s favour, the wider war against coronavirus continues.",News/World news,When will Omicron peak in the UK and is the modelling wrong?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/when-will-omicron-peak-in-uk-and-is-the-modelling-wrong
1/4/2022,"Bins across parts of England are reportedly “overflowing” with rubbish from the festive period due to Covid-related staff shortages. London, Gloucestershire, Somerset and Buckinghamshire are among the areas where councillors have warned that bin collections are being scaled back because of staff sickness.  In Enfield, Conservative councillor Stephanos Ioannou said: “I’ve been driving round my ward and seeing bins overflowing and Christmas trees are left outside.” He said he has received double the number of complaints about missed collections that he would usually receive at this time of year. “Over the Christmas period, usually I get on average 30 emails a week on waste services. I checked my inbox yesterday … and had about 50 or 60.” Chelmsford city council said 23 members of staff were absent and that three days of food waste collections were cancelled. North Somerset council, meanwhile, said it was unable to collect 1,000 recycling bins on New Year’s Eve because crews remained “stretched due to staff sickness”. Declan Wilson, a Liberal Democrat councillor, said Gloucester has been faced with “terrible problems” as a result of a combination of Covid and Brexit. He said that recycling collections were stopped entirely over Christmas as bin collectors working closely in small teams pass the virus to one another. “The reason for it is driver shortages and Covid as well … it hasn’t been great,” he said. Several London boroughs have announced there may be delays in their services in the future. Haringey council warned that “uniquely challenging times” had affected its workforce and Newham council has temporarily suspended bulky waste collection as a result of “higher than normal levels of staff absence”. In Manchester, green food and garden recycling bin collections have been halted until further notice because of staff isolating. Residents have been told to put food waste into general waste bins and to keep hold of garden waste until collections start up again. In Birmingham, the city council apologised for missed collections over the festive period, blaming crews being affected by Covid. Earlier, ministers had requested that public sector leaders set up contingency plans for worst-case scenarios of up to a quarter of staff being off work. Asked whether such shortages were likely, health minister Edward Argar told Times Radio: “We model a range of scenarios up to things we think are highly unlikely, but you still do it because that’s what a responsible government does in preparing for all eventualities.” Meanwhile, the Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils across England, said crews have been strongly affected by the rise of Omicron and warned the problem “may get worse”. An LGA spokesperson said: “As cases of Covid-19 rise in light of the Omicron variant, councils are concerned that these existing staffing issues may get worse.” They also called for workers to be prioritised for Covid tests. Gloucester city council and Enfield council did not respond immediately to requests for comment.",News/World news,Bins ‘overflowing’ in parts of England as Covid hits collections,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/bins-overflowing-in-parts-of-england-as-covid-hits-collections
1/4/2022,"Democrats are seizing on this week’s anniversary of the deadly US Capitol riot to renew a push for voting rights legislation to safeguard democracy.  Majority leader Chuck Schumer announced on Monday that the Senate will vote on changing its own rules on or before 17 January, the federal Martin Luther King Jr Day holiday, if Republicans continue to obstruct election reform. The deadline appears part of a concerted effort to use Thursday’s commemorations, marking a year since a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, seeking to overturn Joe Biden’s election win, to give fresh impetus to the long-stalled legislation. In a letter to Senate Democrats, Schumer argued that the events of 6 January 2021 are directly linked to a campaign by Republican state legislatures to impose voter restriction laws. “Let me be clear,” the New York senator wrote. “6 January was a symptom of a broader illness – an effort to delegitimise our election process, and the Senate must advance systemic democracy reforms to repair our republic or else the events of that day will not be an aberration – they will be the new norm. “Much like the violent insurrectionists who stormed the US Capitol nearly one year ago, Republican officials in states across the country have seized on the former president’s Big Lie about widespread voter fraud to enact anti-democratic legislation and seize control of typically non-partisan election administration functions.” Sweeping voting rights reforms have stalled in the evenly-split 50-50 Senate, repeatedly blocked by a Republican-led filibuster leaving Democrats unable to find the 60 votes needed to advance. Schumer went further than before in calling for a filibuster exception for voting rights. “We must ask ourselves: if the right to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy, then how can we in good conscience allow for a situation in which the Republican party can debate and pass voter suppression laws at the state level with only a simple majority vote, but not allow the United States Senate to do the same? We must adapt. The Senate must evolve, like it has many times before.” He added: “We hope our Republican colleagues change course and work with us. But if they do not, the Senate will debate and consider changes to Senate rules on or before 17 January, Martin Luther King Jr Day, to protect the foundation of our democracy: free and fair elections.” Although Schumer’s words were ostensibly aimed at Republicans, there is little prospect of any members of that party shifting their position. But his true target, amid blanket media coverage of this week’s anniversary, is likely to be Democratic holdouts Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, who have resisted abolishing or changing the filibuster. The senators from West Virginia and Arizona contend that if and when Republicans take control of the chamber, they could use the lower voting threshold to advance bills Democrats oppose. Schumer’s announcement is likely to set up 6 January vigils and Martin Luther King Jr Day events as rallying points for voting rights activists who have criticised Biden and the party in Congress for failing to prioritise the issue. But the president has become less cautious and more direct. Last month, he told ABC News: “If the only thing standing between getting voting rights legislation passed and not getting passed is the filibuster, I support making the exception of voting rights for the filibuster.” Schumer’s announcement was welcomed by Martin Luther King III, son of the civil rights activist and chairman of the Drum Major Institute. “There is no better way to honor my father’s legacy than protecting the right to vote for all Americans,” he said. “The King holiday is historically a day of service, and we hope the United States Senate will serve our democracy by passing the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. “We applaud Senator Schumer for his commitment to expanding voting rights, but we won’t halt our plans for action until legislation has been signed.” Also on Monday, the US Conference of Mayors sent a letter signed by 146 bipartisan mayors to Schumer and the minority leader, Mitch McConnell, urging them to act this month. It noted that 19 states passed 34 laws that made it harder to vote in the past autumn alone. The mayors wrote: “American democracy is stronger when all eligible voters participate in elections. Yet voting rights are under historic attack and our very democracy is threatened. “These bills would stop this voter suppression. They would create national standards for voting access in federal elections that would neutralize many of the restrictive voting laws passed in the states.”",News/US news,Democrats bid to change Senate rules if Republicans thwart voting rights reform,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/03/schumer-senate-democracy-voting-rights-election
1/4/2022,"At the core of Boris Johnson’s Brexit is a conflict between ideology and geography. The purpose of the project is divergence – a competitive leap away from Europe into other markets. But that impulse to move is thwarted by the permanence of Britain’s location. No matter how much sovereignty the Eurosceptics claim over national regulation, governing a medium-sized power 30 miles from the coast of France will always require some accommodation with the interests of neighbouring states. EU membership was not the only possible way to manage those relationships, but it worked better than anything that had been tried in the preceding centuries, and nothing has been arranged to replace it. The Brexit withdrawal deal offers only a technical framework for economic partnership, and even that is unstable, as is clear from the ongoing negotiations over customs checks for Northern Ireland and operating licences for French fishers in UK waters.  The two issues are not equivalent in scale. Much more is at stake on the island of Ireland, given the history of sectarian violence. But they flow from a common Brexit delusion, which is the belief that “taking back control” is a unilateral assertion. In reality, borders have two sides. The folly of ignoring that strategic geometry has been routinely demonstrated, most recently in a silly exchange of recriminations over migrant boat crossings in the Channel. The Home Office, being unable to stop the vessels, has tried blaming French authorities for failing to stop embarkations. France replies that the draw factor is lax British labour regulations that act as a magnet for refugees seeking a new life. Tensions on that front predate Brexit. The UK was not part of the Schengen common travel area, and policing of the Anglo-French border is governed by the bilateral Le Touquet accord. But the capacity for escalation is higher now that Britain has no seat around the EU table where other continental leaders meet. As it happens, France sets the agenda at that table for the first six months of 2022, as holder of the rotating council presidency. That means also that President Emmanuel Macron’s hawkish view of Britain’s obligations to uphold the Brexit agreement it signed will set the tone in Brussels. Since Mr Macron is seeking re-election in April, his attention will be more than usually focused on domestic matters. To the extent that those issues overlap with Brexit – as in the fisheries dispute – there will be pressure to take a hard line with London. There is a tendency in Downing Street to see Mr Macron’s stance as punitive to the point of spite. The Tory Eurosceptic view is that France, affronted by the temerity of Britannia in choosing freedom, is determined to prevent her from enjoying its benefits. That analysis contains a truth, filtered through a jaundiced lens. Mr Macron, in common with other EU leaders, understands that Brexit is a deliberate strategic challenge to the European project, based on the false premise that Britain could retain benefits of proximity to continental markets while using deregulation to outcompete EU businesses. Plainly, it is in the economic interests of member states for that not to happen. It is also in the interest of politicians who are committed to the logic of supranational solidarity that Euroscepticism be seen as a strategic cul-de-sac. Mr Macron is less patient than some of his continental counterparts for that point to be proven. As German chancellor, Angela Merkel took the view that British noses should not be rubbed too hard in the folly of Brexit, lest they be put out of joint. She feared Britain sliding even deeper into populism. Her successor, Olaf Scholz, is closer to Mr Macron’s position. Anglo-French relations are not helped by the low opinion that the French president has of Boris Johnson. He has been quoted describing the prime minister as “un clown”. He believes Mr Johnson is a deceitful and unreliable partner. A run of poor judgments and conspicuous dishonesties have made that assessment of Mr Johnson’s character indisputable. It is a settled view among many voters and formerly loyal Tory MPs that he is a liar. The resignation of David Frost, Johnson’s Brexit negotiator, compounded the domestic crisis engulfing No 10, but will not change the underlying dynamics in relations with the rest of Europe. Lord Frost was a zealot in pursuit of pure sovereignty and, in quitting, he signalled displeasure at compromises imposed from Downing Street. But the prime minister’s room to compromise is limited when so many of his MPs have lost faith in his judgment, already feel betrayed and are winding themselves towards a regicidal frenzy. That is also a consideration for Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, who inherits Lord Frost’s portfolio. She was a remainer in 2016, but her ambition to succeed Mr Johnson is a more salient factor for 2022. She, too, will be wary of alienating the hardliners. The incumbent prime minister’s insecurity might give him cause to prefer provocation in Brussels, on the ancient but shabby premise that foreign quarrels can galvanise domestic audiences. The threat of using Article 16 – the emergency brake in the Brexit deal – has receded while the government deals with another pandemic wave, but a prime minister with few other options keeps his finger on the trigger. Alternatively, he might calculate that a trade war with Brussels would be too expensive and compound the impression of a slide into chaos when what people crave most is a period of sustained, stable and grown-up government. In neither scenario is it likely that the prime minister will be thinking beyond short-term survival or acting with a strategic concept for Britain’s evolving relations with its neighbours. If there was ever such a capacity in Mr Johnson’s regime, it has been swept away in a cascade of crises. When the only purpose left for the prime minister is getting from one day to the next, there is no room for coherent foreign policy. And, since incoherence with regard to Europe is intrinsic to Brexit, there is no imminent prospect of restored stability in relations with Britain’s nearest neighbours. For that to happen, there has to be a resolution in the conflict between geography and ideology. Only one side can win, of course. The facts of Britain’s place in the world beat the fantasies of escaping it. Mr Johnson and his party might continue to postpone their own comprehension of that defeat. They cannot ultimately avoid it.",News/Politics,The Guardian view on Britain and France: the very worst of rivals | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/03/the-guardian-view-on-britain-and-france-the-very-worst-of-rivals
