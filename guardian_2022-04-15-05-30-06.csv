4/15/2022,"Russia’s flagship cruiser Moskva has sunk in “stormy seas” while being towed to a port in the Black Sea, the Russian defence ministry has announced. The Ukrainian southern military command claimed late on Thursday to have struck the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles, causing it to start sinking and forcing the crew to abandon ship. Russia’s defence ministry initially denied reports that it had sunk and claimed the fires had been extinguished. Four Russian ships that had gone to the Moskva’s rescue were being hampered by stormy weather and by ammunition blowing up onboard, it said. But late on Friday, the ministry said in a statement: “The cruiser ship Moskva lost its stability when it was towed to the port because of the damage to the ship’s hull that it received during the fire from the detonation of ammunition. In stormy sea conditions, the ship sank” The apparent attack and sinking of the flagship – 50 days after Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine – represents a symbolic blow to the Kremlin. The Moskva was the pride of Russia’s Black Sea naval fleet and the most prestigious vessel involved in the war against Ukraine.

4/15/2022,"The business case for the proposed Urannah dam in north Queensland – backed by a $483m federal government grant announced last month – reveals the project has been designed to support a massive future expansion of coalmining in the Bowen Basin. Taxpayer funding to the Urannah project has been described as “brazenly political” and was announced before the National Water Grid advisory body, now disbanded, had been able to scrutinise a detailed business case. The proponent’s business case has since been released, prompting concerns about the economic return on investment. It said that over 30 years, local communities would obtain 95c of economic benefit from every dollar spent. Supporting studies show the stated economic benefit is underpinned by assumptions that more water would support the intensification of coalmining – and the development of new mines – in the Queensland Bowen basin. The studies use assumptions from a 2018 report for the mining lobby group, the Minerals Council of Australia, including predictions that metallurgical coal exports would grow by 113m tonnes, or “the equivalent of a large export mine being added to the market every year to 2030”. As a result, the Urannah business case assumes a growth in mining – and associated water demand – until 2049. Tim Buckley, an energy market analyst, said the assumption was “ludicrous” and the market demand for metallurgical coal would, according to a modelling by the International Energy Agency, likely decrease by 57% over the longer term. “We don’t need more dams for coking coal, we need enabling investment to catalyse the new massive zero-emissions industries of the future, where the job opportunities are literally in the hundreds of billions of dollars a year,” Buckley said. “Why are we planning on building more stranded assets rather than building more assets of the future?” When the proponent, Bowen River Utilities, conducted “market sounding” for the Urannah project by talking to potential water customers, it spoke to 13 potential industrial users – all coalmines in the Bowen Basin. The Urannah business case predicts $555m of new economic benefit in the mining sector as a result of the dam project and an additional $727m from agriculture. Guardian Australia reported on Thursday that companies linked to Urannah project had donated more than $150,000 to the Queensland Liberal National party, and that the wife of the federal MP Julian Simmonds is working for the proponent as its communications manager. A spokesperson for Bowen River Utilities said John Cotter Jr, the sole director of the company, “has made donations to both the ALP and the LNP, all of which have been publicly declared (with) the Electoral Commission Queensland and Australian Electoral Commission”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Conservation groups said the extent to which the project was designed to facilitate the expansion of Queensland coalmining meant it could be used to campaign against inner-city Liberals – including Simmonds, who represents the green-tinged west Brisbane electorate of Ryan. Simmonds has been contacted for comment. Dave Copeman, the head of the Queensland Conservation Council, said connections between the LNP and destructive projects “demonstrates yet again that the party has a serious credibility problem when it asks voters to take it seriously as taking action on climate” When the federal government announced funding ahead of the federal budget, the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, said the project would “provide a secure and affordable water supply for mining, industrial and urban use”. Bowen River Utilities did not respond to a specific offer to comment about the extent to which the project relied upon the expansion of coalmining. A spokesperson has previously said: “The Urannah Dam will transform the Greater Whitsunday region and deliver thousands of jobs, water security, reliable renewable energy and enormous economic benefits for North Queensland taxpayer”. “That’s why it is backed by regional communities who have a real determination driving us to build this project. “The dam also has bipartisan support from all three levels of government.”",News/Australia news,Urannah dam business case assumes massive growth in Queensland coalmining,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/15/urannah-dam-business-case-assumes-massive-growth-in-queensland-coalmining
4/15/2022,"Kate Grenville has been unsettling conventional narratives of colonial Australia since the publication of her 2005 novel The Secret River, which drew on her own family history. So far, this has been a fictional project: in her novels, Grenville asks what role stories have to play in the way we understand history and what new perspectives on the truth might be offered by fiction. Her work has unnerved some historians, who have been uncomfortable with the idea that she might claim a status for her novels equal to historical truth. This misreading of her project is one that Grenville seemed to poke fun at in her most recent novel, A Room Made of Leaves, with the conceit that the novel was really a secret manuscript written by the early Australian settler Elizabeth Macarthur, then hidden for years in an attic. Grenville’s fictional Elizabeth revealed her feelings about her irascible husband, the colonist John Macarthur, and her struggle to make a life in the new colony. With Elizabeth Macarthur’s Letters, Grenville does what she was just pretending to do in A Room Made of Leaves: she acts as editor and transcriber – and many ways, translator – of Elizabeth’s real epistles. More than 250 years after she was born, Elizabeth finally speaks in her own voice, no longer ventriloquized through a novelist’s imagination. And yet, what does it mean for historical documents to speak for themselves, Grenville asks? What do Elizabeth’s letters have to say, if we attend to the complexity of voice, the workings of irony and literary deflection? On the surface, as Grenville acknowledges, many of these letters are surprisingly bland and seldom offer insight into the turbulent times or the woman herself – although later in life, as her husband’s mental illness progressed to extreme paranoia, Elizabeth’s anguish and “great grief” are more plainly expressed. Grenville believes that these documents are themselves a kind of fiction, a “mask of demure formality” hiding a woman who was not able to openly show the shrewd wit and penetrating intelligence that occasionally flashes through. This mask was adopted, Grenville argues, at least partly in response to the myriad constraints on writing, not least the fact that Elizabeth’s letters were not private; her husband most likely read them, and they would have been also read by a sphere of acquaintance around the addressee. In contemporary terms, these letters are more like social media posts made on a person’s public profile rather than a discreet direct message. The correspondence collected here spans Elizabeth’s first extant letter, addressed to her mother as Elizabeth is about to leave England with her husband and sail to the brand-new colony of New South Wales in 1789, to one of the last she wrote to her son Edward before her death in 1850. Grenville provides a short introduction to each letter, and the vivid energy of the volume derives from the fascinating dialogue between these two voices: the colonial wife, writing to family and friends alike in achingly constrained prose; and the contemporary novelist who is by turns obsessed, compelled, and discomforted by her enigmatic subject. John Macarthur has taken all the credit for establishing the wool industry in Australia, but Grenville points out that he was away in England for long periods during the most crucial phase of this development. In his absence, Elizabeth oversaw all aspects of the Macarthur estate, which became a massively complex enterprise. Grenville explores the disjunction between this reality and Elizabeth’s careful representation of herself as “timid and irresolute”; a modest, subordinate wife. She was one of those clever, unconventional women who have always been of interest to Grenville, and this collection displays the author’s inner conflict as her admiration for Elizabeth vies with critique of this woman whose advancement was conditional on the oppression of others. Grenville does not attempt to gloss over or excuse Elizabeth’s indifference to enslaved people and contempt towards Australia’s Indigenous population, so very different from the compassionate attitude Grenville gave her in her novel. “She could have had a more humane perspective,” Grenville admits, “and I wish she had.” Grenville makes her argument with the delicate skill of a literary scholar, but invites the reader into a zone of doubt, uncertainty, and disquiet that feels entirely belonging to a novelist. She constantly questions her own reading, allowing for the possibility of other perspectives, other truths. We have the fictional, hot-blooded version of Elizabeth constructed in A Room Made of Leaves, born from Grenville’s fascination with a single, erotic “blush” confessed in one of the letters collected here. And we have these letters, which “give readers a chance to decide for themselves,” as Grenville says. In the counterpoint between them, she offers a compelling perspective on the author’s dialogue with a elusive, complicated subject. Elizabeth Macarthur’s Letters, edited by Kate Grenville, is published by Text Publishing ($34.99).",Arts/Books,"Elizabeth Macarthur’s Letters, edited by Kate Grenville review – a fascinating dialogue",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/15/elizabeth-macarthurs-letters-edited-by-kate-grenville-review-a-fascinating-dialogue
4/15/2022,"Scott Morrison’s hand-picked candidate in McMahon accused Narendra Modi of causing “hatred [and] fear” in India and accused him of being “unable to do a press conference at all for fear of being asked a Gujrat or Delhi or All India genocide question”. Although Vivek Singha’s social media advocacy is unlikely to be decisive in the relatively safe New South Wales Labor seat, the strident criticism of the Indian prime minister could be a source of a significant embarrassment for Morrison, who has closely courted Modi. Singha, a tax specialist at PepsiCo, contested the seat for the Liberals in 2019, achieving a 5.5% swing against the incumbent, shadow climate change minister Chris Bowen. He was one of the nine candidates selected by a three-person committee including Morrison and the New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, just a week before the 21 May election was called. On his now-deleted Twitter account, Singha was a frequent antagonist of the Indian PM, whose office and personal accounts have a total of 125.8 million followers. COVID-19 does not see race, religion, colour, caste, creed, language or borders before striking.Our response and conduct thereafter should attach primacy to unity and brotherhood.We are in this together: PM @narendramodi In April 2019 when Modi’s official account tweeted that Covid “does not see race, religion, colour caste, [or] creed”, Singha replied “shame that you have divided the country to such an extent that you had to resort to tweeting this”. “Sad how much hatred, fear, hunger [and] disappointment you have caused.” Modi is a Hindu nationalist who came to power in 2014, despite questions over his complicity in the 2002 Gujarat riots that killed at least 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, while he was chief minister. Modi has always denied any wrongdoing. Ethnic and religious violence have been on the rise in India, where there are accusations that state police are “mercenaries” of the hardline Hindu nationalist government, and have murdered Muslims and Dalits. On 21 April 2020, Singha suggested that Modi was “unable to do a press conference at all for fear of being asked a Gujrat or Delhi or All India genocide question”. A day earlier, when another tweeter said that “since 2002 fame Narendra Modi came to power in 2014, India has lost its virtues”, Singha replied: “True.” Singha also repeatedly criticised Modi’s Covid policies, including, on 22 March 2020, a 14-hour curfew to prepare the nation for later lockdowns. Singha questioned why Modi was “so fearful of closing down the country” and why he had imposed a “practice” when India was facing a “real test”. “He is cheating the nation … lulling people into a false sense of security.” “This looks like [it] is turning into a huge fundraiser from [Modi’s] tweets,” Singha posted in reference to the curfew. “Is this a corona mitigation measure or an invite to corona,” he queried, in reference to large crowds at train stations and airports before the curfew. In July 2020, when the Bharatiya Janata Party tweeted images of Modi purportedly visiting the “Nimu forward post in Ladakh”, Singha replied with a Google maps search suggesting that the prime minister was five hours and 45 minutes drive away. In April 2020, Singha congratulated communist candidate Rakesh Singha, a family member, on his election to the Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly. Under Morrison and Modi’s leadership Australia and India have pursued closer ties, including a free trade agreement and cooperation on security through the Quad as a counterweight to China. Morrison has lavished praise on Modi, including describing him as “an empowered and visionary leader” at a virtual summit with the Indian PM in June 2020. In November, Morrison described Modi as his “very good friend”, “a great leader, internationally” and “a strong leader who believes passionately in the principles of democracy and the future of his country”. Earlier in April, Morrison defended his intervention in the NSW Liberal branch, boasting that taking control of preselections had resulted in half of all candidates being women. “Of those, they came from Vietnamese, Indian, Chinese backgrounds, as well as Sri Lankan and Croatian. “I think the candidates that we’ve chosen, I’d like the members to be able to do that, but we were running out of time. The job had to get done.” A Liberal Party spokesman said: “Mr Singha is a strong supporter of Australia’s close and warm relationship with the nation of India and its government.”",News/Australia news,Morrison’s captain’s pick for NSW seat accused Indian PM of causing ‘hatred and fear’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/15/morrisons-captains-pick-for-nsw-seat-accused-indian-pm-of-causing-hatred-and-fear
4/15/2022,"The national academics’ union is urging the university sector to pave the way for nation-leading gender affirmation leave in Australia. The issue has been highlighted by University of Melbourne staff calling for paid gender transition leave as part of negotiations on a new three-year enterprise agreement, first reported by the Age. The National Tertiary Education Union, which is representing staff, will also ask for employees to be given the right to reject 26 January as a public holiday and take their entitled leave on a different day. The move would allow staff who viewed the date as “Invasion Day” and support the First Nations-driven movement to treat it as an ordinary working day. But associate professor at University of Queensland’s law school Paul Harpur, warned swapping leave days could result in the number of public holidays being decreased in future enterprise negotiations. “I don’t think it’s in the union’s best interests,’ he said. “At the moment, it’s a legislated day, you’ve got to have legislative protection, if you reduce it to a bargaining, I think it could lead to unfortunate outcomes.” The union’s log of claims propose 30 days of paid gender transition leave be made available to staff. NTEU Victorian division assistant secretary, Sarah Roberts, said the university sector could become a leader on gender transition leave to allow them to undertake psychological and medical treatment. “With gender affirmation leave, I think there’s a push across progressive areas to have this recognised as a form of leave,” she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “It was a kind of move in the trade union movement to recognise domestic violence leave in a similar way in past rounds of bargaining. And we see that more and more becoming commonplace in collective agreements across the economy.” Roberts believed it was likely there would be interest from staff at other universities keen to pursue similar arrangements relating to the Australia Day public holiday. “Given the level of public interest that there’s been in, it wouldn’t surprise me if there’s been other NTEU branches that prick up their ears and consider this to be an opportunity for them to pursue,” she said. Roberts said it would allow staff the option to stand in solidarity and recognise the pain of their Indigenous colleagues, some of whom view 26 January as a day of mourning. “In the union movement and across social movements, more generally, we talk about it as invasion day. In recognition of that day, being a day of the sorrow and horror and pain for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander colleagues,” she said. Roberts said the idea stemmed from clauses in public service enterprise agreements. In the Victorian public service’s workplace agreement, employees can, in agreement with their employer, substitute another day for any public holidays to observe religious or cultural occasions or like reasons of significance to the employee. Some APS enterprise agreements contain a similar clause. A spokesperson for the University of Melbourne said the NTEU has not yet shared its proposed claims with the institution. “Nor has it responded to the University’s longstanding invitation to commence bargaining, which is the appropriate forum for discussing and resolving these matters,” they said. “We look forward to bargaining in good faith with the union and staff on a new enterprise agreement.”",News/Australia news,University of Melbourne staff push for paid gender transition leave and flexible approach to Australia Day,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/15/university-of-melbourne-staff-push-for-paid-gender-transition-leave-and-flexible-approach-to-australia-day
4/15/2022,"An urgent review of “totally inadequate” boarding house inspection practices has been launched by the Inner West council following the fatal fire at a property that claimed three lives in Newtown last month. Mayor Darcy Byrne has also written to the New South Wales government to request a joint review of boarding house regulation in a bid to make the last resort housing measures safer and fairer. The fire – that police allege was deliberately lit by a former resident who has been charged with three counts of murder – also prompted the council to inspect three other boarding houses owned by Albert Wong, who owned the Newtown property. Guardian Australia does not suggest the condition of the home was a factor in the fatal fire, or that Wong was responsible for the fire. The Inner West council has confirmed the property had passed its most recent fire inspection and had a current fire compliance certificate. Inspectors allegedly uncovered breaches of state regulations at three of his Petersham and Stanmore properties and have issued statutory orders for urgent structural and electrical repair work, as well as general cleaning. “Mr Wong is now working with council to resolve these matters,” a statement from council read. If the orders are not complied with, the council will consider issuing fines or taking civil enforcement action. Wong did not respond to requests for comment. Byrne wrote to the premier, Dominic Perrottet, in March requesting state government assistance on a joint review of the regulation and management of the sector, and has commissioned a council-led review of its own systems while he awaits response. He said the tragedy in Newtown had shone a light on conditions in boarding houses. “We must not look away from this problem but instead investigate and confront it. We can’t afford to wait for more fires or fatalities.” About 3,000 people are believed to be living in more than 300 registered boarding homes across the inner west local government area – accounting for more than a fifth of NSW’s boarding house stock. Under state law, local councils are responsible for approving new boarding houses and enforcing safety and accommodation standards, with powers to fine operators for breaking the code. But with such an uneven distribution of boarding homes between council areas, Byrne said the burden was proving too much for his council, and the current system was “totally inadequate”. “I’m concerned that we’re not getting to inspect enough properties frequently enough, and that there are a lot of safety issues being encountered by residents which are going undetected or unreported,” he said. “If we’re going to have boarding houses as a place of last resort, then there’s got to be a proper system of regulation and compliance, in which we make sure that the properties are in decent working order, and that people are not being mistreated by their landlords.” Newtown Neighbourhood Centre advocates for the rights of boarding house residents and most recently worked with emergency services to find housing for the men who lost everything in the Newtown fire. Centre chief executive, Liz Yeo, told Guardian Australia at the time of the blaze that the property was “cramped, crowded” and “in a dilapidated state”. While she wants to see the standard for boarding houses lifted across the board, she has warned against drastic action that does not include a major boost to public housing. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “If you go and shut down every boarding house that doesn’t meet the standard that you or I might consider would be acceptable, you’re going to have a lot more people sleeping on the street,” Yeo said. “This is a real dilemma in this space, and that’s why there does need to be an increased supply of social and affordable housing. “We’re not saying boarding houses shouldn’t exist. There is still a place for them. But if there was a better supply [of affordable housing], we would have less of these issues.” The state government has been contacted for comment.",News/Australia news,Boarding house regulations in Sydney’s inner west under review after fatal Newtown fire ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/15/boarding-house-regulations-in-sydneys-inner-west-under-review-after-fatal-newtown-fire
4/15/2022,"Curtin is the type of safe seat that doesn’t normally see or hear a lot from politicians. “I’ve been here for 17 years, I’ve never met one,” says a local men’s hairstylist, Peter Alan. “I find it a bit weird that, as a business owner, I’ve never seen a politician.” Liberal or conservative since its creation in 1949, the blue-ribbon seat in Perth’s affluent western suburbs takes in the inner-suburban and beachside areas between the Swan River and the Indian Ocean. The former foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop was the local member here for 11 years. Tom, a retired geologist stopping to talk at Sculpture by the Sea, cites the fact that Cottesloe, within the boundaries of Curtin, was one of just two state seats to return a Liberal in Mark McGowan’s landslide 2021 election. “We only see [politicians] at election time, and only in the letterbox,” Tom says. But things are a little different this time. “The Liberal party has sent us three lots of stuff, usually we don’t hear from them at all until the week before the election,” says Tom’s wife, Marie. “We’ve had more [contact] this year than ever before.” There is a good reason for that. The Liberal MP who succeeded Bishop, Celia Hammond, holds Curtin with a margin of 13.9%. But she faces a challenge from the independent Kate Chaney, one of a crop of mostly inner-city independents backed by Climate 200 who are running on a platform of greater action on climate change and integrity in politics. Chaney brings a cohort of a dozen volunteers with her to Cottesloe beach, projecting the image of a people-powered campaign as Sculpture by the Sea officials hover nervously, warning against turning the event into a political sideshow. The candidate tells Guardian Australia she’s running on the “huge economic opportunities arising out of decarbonisation” as Western Australia could become “a renewable energy force”. According to Chaney, Curtin voters are less focused on “hyper-local” issues and more on “systemic change on macro issues”, such as climate and integrity. In short, they are post-material – and can well afford to be, in an electorate dominated by professionals and managers, who together make up more than half of employed people. In Curtin, the median household income is $2,052 a week, well above the Australian average of $1,438. Voters say Curtin felt well-served by Bishop. At the Floreat Forum shopping centre near Hammond’s electorate office, Jennifer Stacey says it “seemed to mean a lot, when Julie Bishop was there”. “People would say, ‘Oh, we’ve got someone sitting in cabinet’ – now I’m not really sure what that person [Hammond] is doing, what sort of influence they have.” Stacey is a progressive voter who says she votes “out of protest against the Liberals” because they seem to take the seat for granted – but she hasn’t heard of Chaney, whose campaign did not kick off until late January. “I think we would need to be aware of them now, it’s a bit concerning – it’s a bit late in the race to not be,” Stacey says. But others have heard about the alternative. At a cafe in Subiaco, Andrew, a resident of the suburb for 40 years, is poring over an article in the West Australian about the local contest. He says the Liberals seem “a bit concerned about this new lady” as Chaney appears to be “nipping away” at their large margin. “She’s got so many of the billboards around the electorate already – she’s got an active group to assist her.” Andrew says he is from a farming community originally, noting that farmers are “critically aware” of climate change. He says Curtin could go the same way as Warringah, where Zali Steggall “took out a Liberal” – the former prime minister Tony Abbott. “The Liberal government is seen to be dragging their feet a bit on [climate change]. Particularly before they went to Glasgow – they had to be dragged kicking and screaming to net zero by 2050.” “I don’t think Hammond has done a great deal,” Andrew says. “She came from a Catholic university, which were quite anti-women’s rights – that doesn’t gel with me. She hasn’t had a high profile.” Marie, a high school teacher, says she is “disappointed by some of [Hammond’s] voting patterns”. “I’m not happy with their policies on refugees, and some of the religious legislation I didn’t approve of at all,” she says. Hammond pushes back against the characterisation of being a conservative in a moderate Liberal area, saying “assumptions are made” and a reputation can “take on a life of its own and becomes an accepted truth, even if it’s not”. The 53-year-old says her reported views – which include downplaying humanity’s contribution to the climate crisis and concerns about premarital sex and militant feminism – have changed. “That’s what growth and learning and compassion and being with people is all about,” she says. “But I’m still fundamentally the same person, and I don’t actually label myself anything. So when it was put to me that I was conservative as opposed to moderate, my response is I’m a Liberal.” Hammond says it is “well known that I was part of a group of Liberal MPs who advocated strongly for the commitment to a net zero by 2050 and with a detailed plan”. She says before she was a politician, negative campaigning didn’t speak to her, so she wants a positive campaign about what she can deliver – but she will “call out and contest” ideas with the other candidates. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Both campaigns are drawing a sharp contrast where they need to. The Liberals have targeted Chaney for her one-time membership of the Labor party, which Chaney explains she joined “briefly” before leaving, dismayed by “tribalism”. Chaney criticises Hammond for having “spoken recently” about the need for more action on climate change and a stronger integrity commission: “The reality is we’ve seen nothing on those issues from the last three years.” The independent refuses to say who she would support in the event of a hung parliament, only that supporting the Coalition is a “possible outcome” if it improves its climate policies, and she will decide based on who has a “credible” offering. Voters seem to credit her family’s Liberal pedigree. “I’m sure she’s got strong Liberal values – I don’t think that will worry people,” Andrew says. Others are attracted because she represents change. Edward Brannan, who lives at City Beach, a little further up the coast from Cottesloe, says he feels despair at the two-party system: “It’s just not getting things done – it’s not addressing the issues, and I can’t see that changing.” Brannan, who subscribes to Climate 200’s communications, says he is voting on climate, accountability in government and women’s rights. “It’s appalling to have a federal government which is not accountable for its actions, and there’s nobody like Icac overseeing it. “That’s been avoided for the whole parliamentary session. What they put forward was rubbish.” Although some frustrated progressive voters are glad to have an alternative, many here are rusted-on Liberals. Kate Bailey, who stops to speak in the street near the upmarket fashion shops of the Claremont Quarter, describes herself as a “pretty solid voter” – not a swinging one. She thinks Scott Morrison is “fantastic”. “[Morrison takes] quite a level-headed approach to the issues, particularly Covid. He doesn’t seem to be one of the name-calling politicians that you see, particularly going on on the other side of the fence.” “I think he’s done a pretty good job managing the country over the last two or three years.” Many are still undecided. Jane and Laura, from Claremont, are weighing the choice. Jane leans Liberal, describing Hammond as a good politician, who “works very hard” and is “underestimated”. “I feel sorry for Scott Morrison in one way, because it’s been a terrible time,” she says, although she concedes the prime minister has been “MIA [missing in action] more often than he should”. But Laura – despite agreeing that Hammond did a good job connecting small businesses to federal support – is considering the alternative. “I’d like to see more on the global warming and climate side of things,” she says. “I think there is a lot of silence there – I don’t feel comfortable with that at the moment. Laura feels Morrison has “missed the ball on so many major crises over the last three years” and is disappointed in his leadership – although she is “not really a fan of Anthony Albanese either”. Despite differing views about Morrison’s performance, many voters in Curtin are looking for the same things in terms of policy – the question is how to get it. For Liberal-leaning voters the choice is one of revolution or evolution: whether a voice outside the tent can help alter the course on climate; or whether an MP in government who says her views have changed trumps the uncertainty of a newcomer.",News/Australia news,Could a climate of change eject the Liberals from the Perth blue-ribbon seat of Curtin?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/15/could-a-climate-of-change-eject-the-liberals-from-the-perth-blue-ribbon-seat-of-curtin
4/15/2022,"I have been bullied, laughed at and been at the receiving end of various (probably unconscious) biases that resulted in me having to change jobs multiple times. I consider myself fortunate that every job change has proven to be the right step upwards in my career, but I can’t reconcile myself with the facts that those perpetrators are carrying on and thriving as if nothing has happened. I regularly wake up at 3am with a pounding chest as all that trauma comes back to me, and feel sheer anger and helplessness against what seems to be a real injustice. Eleanor says: Once when I was in a lather about the fact that Very Bad People can move through the world more or less unpunished, someone who was trying to be helpful said, “you know, the best revenge is to live your own life well”. I said, “No, the best revenge would be they go to jail.” I’ve come to think we’d both said something true. They were right that indefinite anger does not by itself do anything to correct the moral score. Anger that goes unexpressed, anger that isn’t harnessed, anger that wakes up without warning somewhere behind the sternum – can curdle inside the wrong person so the victim of an unfairness just ends up getting hurt twice. But I was right that the scales of justice can hang tilted for far too long. Sometimes the reason we hunger for punishment or recrimination isn’t just bloodthirstiness or a wish to strike back, adder-like, at something that threatened us. It’s a way of demanding the acknowledgment that the original insult denied. Of course, it would be preferable if they had an epiphany all on their own and agreed we deserve acknowledgment. But if we can’t have that, at least getting them to face consequences for their actions forces them to experience what they should have known all along: that what they did wasn’t OK, that we matter, and so does what they did. It seems to me that the task for moving past this injustice is to chart a way between these two truths: to find something that sates the desire to feel acknowledged without consuming you and keeping you awake. I don’t know the details of what these people said or did to you, nor how egregiously it violated anti-discrimination laws and policies where you live. I don’t know whether you have access to any formal remedies, or whether it would pragmatically be worth pursuing them. But the fact that this took place in a workplace adds indignity, and I wonder whether righting that indignity could help make this feel closed. You could use your skills and professionalism – the very things these people impugned – to make a formal list of what happened, when, and with whom, in as clinical a way as possible. You could leave that paper trail with a friend or former colleague, or even HR at a former company (though treat this one with caution, and know what processes will be triggered if you do). This may give you somewhere to put the intrusive memories when they appear, in a way that feels like harnessing them, rather than letting them harness you. You don’t need to send it to anyone implicated, and even if you do, don’t hold your breath for an apology. Ransoming our happiness to a wrongdoer’s reaction is a sure way to be disappointed. If you find that these feelings don’t pass with time, professional therapy can be a wonderful tool for acknowledging past trauma while keeping it in the past.

4/15/2022,"The nation’s largest home care provider says its aged care workers are at “breaking point” and are only receiving a fraction of the Coalition’s promised $800 bonus due to flaws with the scheme’s design. The vast and systemic problems facing aged care were exposed during the pandemic, including in home care, where workers have faced increased demand for services, huge staff turnover, abuse from families, and continuing low rates of pay. Both Labor and the Coalition have promised to better fund aged care, including a pledge from the Coalition to fund 80,000 new home care places and pay aged care workers $800 as a workforce bonus, designed in part to retain workers in the sector. But the chief executive of myHomecare Group, Stuart Miller, said turnover in the sector remained “nothing short of abysmal” and that the bonuses had meant “not a thing” in terms of staff retention. The group’s staff turnover was roughly 30% in the past year, better than the industry average but still extremely challenging to cope with, Miller said. “The outcome for us is that we are having to constantly manage which clients get the level of care that they need,” he said. “We make sure those people who have urgent needs always get met, but sometimes it means your house might not get cleaned this week, it might have to wait until next week, and that’s a really unfortunate thing for everybody.” Miller said home care workers had largely been forgotten in the current election campaign, despite working on the frontline of the pandemic in roles of extreme stress. He said the last two years had taken a huge toll on the sector, and called on the government to establish a new dedicated mental health support service for aged care workers. Without it, the company fears mass resignations across the sector. One of the company’s Sydney-based case managers, Megan Mainwaring, said the compounding pressures of the pandemic had led to increased stress and abuse of her care workers. More clients were staying at home and avoiding family contact due to the pandemic, putting more demand on home care workers to provide services. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “We just don’t have the staff and when we do have good staff, they move on to bigger and better things, because the pay is so low,” she said. “And it’s hard work – emotionally, not physically. And when you can go to Aldi and work as a checkout operator and earn $10 an hour more, it’s quite deflating.” Aged care minister Richard Colbeck says the government has released 30,000 of the 80,000 home care places it promised last year. The funding is being progressively released until 2023. “We are releasing new packages at the rate of about 770 per week to continue to reduce the waiting list – and at a rate that supports a workforce that has grown by 15,000 since the start of November and continues to increase,” a spokesperson said. Mainwaring said she struggled to understand how 80,000 packages could be created, given the workforce challenges. “When I get a notification to sign up another client, which is great, but I just go ‘where are we going to get workers?’,” she said. “We just don’t have enough.” Miller said many of his workers were only receiving a fraction of the promised $800 bonus, because it was only available for work conducted in one stream of federally funded home care packages. Most of his workers worked across multiple funding streams, including for aged care clients funded by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs and state governments. “All of our workers work across multiple streams so actually very few got the full $800,” he said. He said the sector was staffed largely by part-time workers, but the government had used a pro-rata system to calculate the bonus payment. That meant many workers received even less of the $800. Colbeck’s office said the government also acknowledged the “pressures on the aged care workforce” and its impact on mental health, and pointed to the government’s funding of $7.1m to help ensure access to Beyond Blue.",News/Australia news,"Home aged care staff at ‘breaking point’, as most miss out on Coalition’s $800 bonus",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/15/home-aged-care-staff-at-breaking-point-as-most-miss-out-on-coalitions-800-bonus

4/15/2022,"The Morrison government is facing criticism for excluding flood victims outside Lismore from a new $350-a-week “top-up” paid to those unable to work. The disaster recovery allowance is paid at the jobseeker rate of $642.70 a fortnight to those who are temporarily unable to earn an income. The benefit is separate from the disaster recovery payment, which has been the subject of controversy after the Morrison government initially provided an extra $2,000 to flood victims in the National party-held areas Lismore, Richmond Valley and Clarence Valley but excluded nearby areas held by Labor. That decision was later reversed after other areas were assessed, with the government arguing Lismore had been initially prioritised as it was worst hit by the disaster. But last Friday the government quietly added a $350-a-week top-up payment to the disaster recovery allowance. The top-up is now automatically added to the payments of disaster recovery allowance recipients who work or live in the Lismore local government area. In a repeat of the situation that sparked fury last month, flood victims receiving disaster recovery allowance in other areas, such as those in the Labor-held seat of Richmond, are ineligible. Because the top-up payment can be paid for a maximum of 13 weeks, those in Lismore could theoretically receive a total of $4,550 more than victims from other areas. The federal National MP for Page, Kevin Hogan, had last week called for the disaster payments to be doubled. But the decision to introduce the “top-up” payment was not publicised by the federal government. The only official announcement was an update on the Services Australia website. Hogan has since labelled the decision to only include Lismore as “absurd”, while NSW state Liberal MP Catherine Cusack said the latest announcement showed a “total lack of integrity in the commonwealth’s funding approach”. Cusack, who intends to quit parliament over what she believes was the politicisation of NSW floods funding by the Morrison government, told Guardian Australia: “The whole northern rivers community would unite around the idea that funding should be according to need and not determined by where people live.” Last month, after fierce criticism from Cusack, Labor and others, the federal government added Ballina, Byron and Tweed to a list of areas eligible for an extra $2,000 in payments. Those areas are in the federal electorate of Richmond, held by Labor’s Justine Elliot. Elliot, who has accused the government of “pork-barrelling”, said the decision to once again exclude her constituents was “appalling”. “What makes it even worse is they snuck it out a Friday afternoon, they didn’t do a press conference,” Elliott told Guardian Australia. “I first heard about it when I saw it on the Services Australia website. They were doing it really quietly.” “There are people here who desperately need the top-up. Of course Lismore desperately needs that, and we feel for them, but we’re just as worthy,” she said. A joint press release issued on Tuesday by the federal and NSW government that outlined new flood support made no mention of the “top-up” payment. “It seems unfair it’s there for Lismore and not for us,” Elliot said. “I think the fact they’re trying to hide it shows they know that. These people have been through so much. Everyone in my community is really traumatised. People have lost their homes, their ability to work, because the business was flooded.” Mandy Nolan, who is running for the Greens in Richmond, said many people in the electorate “were unable to access their properties by car or couldn’t leave their property because “it’s impossible”. “These people have missed out on the support they need,” she said. “I’ve been into some of these areas. They have to hike on a road by foot two hours on rope into their properties. They’re the people who have really missed out. This recovery top-up would be so helpful.” Like Elliot, Nolan also believed the decision was politically motivated. “To cut out areas because they’re not a safe National seat, which Lismore is, [is wrong].” Because it is only the Lismore local government area that is eligible for the “top-up”, it is likely some of Hogan’s own constituents have also missed out on the extra support this time. “This funding has been targeted using a one-in-500 year flood definition,” Hogan told Guardian Australia. “The bureaucrats in Canberra (Australian Climate Service, National Recovery and Resilience Agency, and Bureau of Meteorology), somehow decided the one-in-500 year event only happened in Lismore. “This is obviously absurd. I have told the minister the one-in-500 year definition needs to be expanded to other communities.” A National Recovery and Resilience Agency spokesperson said the government had made additional support available to those who live or work in Lismore “as it was the most significantly affected local government area based on the proportion of people and businesses directly impacted”. He said the top-up payment had been paid to 2,037 people, of the 16,485 people eligible for the disaster allowance in the 58 flood-affected local government areas in New South Wales. Hogan and the emergency management and national recovery and resilience minister, Bridget McKenzie, were approached for comment.",News/Australia news,Coalition faces criticism for limiting ‘top-up’ payment to Lismore flood victims only,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/15/coalition-faces-criticism-for-limiting-top-up-payment-to-lismore-flood-victims-only
4/15/2022,"On the face of it, another month of Australia’s unemployment remaining around the 4% mark should be cause for celebration. Since the Australian Bureau of Statistics began releasing labour force figures in 1978, it has never released a figure as low as March’s official estimate of 3.95% (or, in its full, geeky glory, of 3.9542384%). The last time it was this low was in November 1974. Most researchers predict it will fall further, such as the ANZ’s 3.3% forecast by the end of 2022, or the Reserve Bank’s central forecast – reiterated just over a week ago – for the jobless rate to fall to below 4% this year and to remain there next year too. Most other jobless measures continue to head lower as well. The so-called underutilisation rate – which combines the unemployment and underemployment rates – fell another 0.3 percentage points to 10.3% last month. At the nadir of the first Covid wave, this gauge was 14.1% and on Thursday’s numbers, we haven’t been this low since just before the global financial crisis erupted in September 2008 during Kevin Rudd’s Labor government. Taking a wider view, though, the results – while pleasing – are neither particularly exceptional nor complete, despite upbeat commentary from the government. #BREAKING: The unemployment rate remains at 4%, a 48-yr equal low.With 17,900 jobs created in March, all full-time jobs, female unemployment fell to 3.7% - the lowest since 1974.The youth unemployment rate fell & is now at its lowest in 14 years. pic.twitter.com/8kreqF6LU1 As the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) noted earlier this week, jobless rates have in fact been sinking in many countries. For the G7 rich nations the February jobless rate averaged 4.2%, while in neighbouring New Zealand it was just 3.2% at the end of 2021. The test for how well low jobless figures will go down with voters may come with what the University of Melbourne labour economist John De New dubs the “last piece of the puzzle”: wages. The RBA noted that despite jobless rates diving, wage growth remains “only around the relatively low rates prevailing before the pandemic”. Any pickup “is still expected to be only gradual”, the central bank said, while admitting it remains uncertain how salaries will respond to historically low levels of unemployment. In February, the ABS reported the wage price index had risen 2.3% in 2021, well shy of the 3.5% increase in consumer prices. The next wages update will land on 18 May, just three days before voters go to the polls. De New says there’s been a longstanding “disconnect between returns to capital and returns to labour”, where companies have scooped up most of the spoils of improved profitability rather than sharing them with staff, even as jobless levels have kept dropping. “It’s shocking how flat wages have been and how a lot of the benefits of the last 10 years have gone to the stock market,” he says. “I don’t think that’s sustainable, and it’s obviously one of the driving forces of income inequality in this country.” His team’s work with the CBA to track people’s wellbeing found payments like jobkeeper and jobseeker played important roles in keeping people either linked to employers during the worst of the Covid disruptions, or ensuring minimum income support. De New expects the background issues of job insecurity – revealed during the pandemic by people forced to turn up for work ill rather than stay at home without an income – will again move to the forefront as people fill vacancies, but not in jobs they particularly want. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Some people obviously are having a harder time finding an appropriate job,” he said, adding that the decline of traditionally more stable work in areas such as manufacturing is only likely to continue. The National Skills Commission echoed De New’s views, forecasting out to the end of 2026 a long-term structural shift in employment towards services industries. Healthcare and social assistance, for instance, is expected to grow by 301,000 jobs or 15.8%, while professional, scientific and technical services will add 206,600 jobs or 16.8%. The two other big growth areas are likely to be education and training, and accommodation and food services. Michele O’Neil, the president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, said the notion low unemployment would lead to wage growth was “based on a 1980s understanding of the labour force, when the vast majority of jobs were secure”. “The headline unemployment rate hides the reality that millions of Australians are in insecure work, working multiple jobs or struggling to find the hours that they need to support themselves and their families,” O’Neil said. “More workers than ever before are having to work two, three or four jobs just to get by.” Cassandra Goldie, the president of the Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss), said 760,000 people remain as long-term unemployed or on jobseeker. Half of them were 45 years of age or older, and a third of them have a disability. While the economy has added almost 400,000 jobs since the low point of the pandemic in March 2020, the number of entry-level jobs was actually about 150,000 fewer than pre-pandemic levels, she said. “While there are more vacancies, that’s really due to staff turnover, short-term employment opportunities [and] the casualisation of those jobs,” Goldie said. “We’ve had double the number of people who are working four jobs or more since about 2014.” Jobseeker payments had now dropped to $46 a day from $80, with neither the Coalition and Labor planning to review the policy post-election. “There were very precious dollars for people who needed them,” Goldie said, adding Acoss had won backing from a range of businesses and other groups, including independent candidates, that the payments should be lifted to at least $70. “The most important thing we can do to support jobs and the lifting of incomes is to lift up the incomes of people in the bottom 40% of the community,” she said. “That’s the engine room of the economy – not relying on trickle-down economics like big tax cuts for people on higher incomes.”",News/Australia news,Are Australia’s unemployment figures cause for celebration or is the devil in the detail?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/15/are-australias-unemployment-figures-cause-for-celebration-or-is-the-devil-in-the-detail
4/15/2022,"As of this week, Queenslanders no longer have to prove they are double vaccinated to gain entry to entertainment and cultural venues, which are back at 100% capacity a month after mask requirements eased. And in South Australia, mask restrictions are lifting on Friday. But more than an estimated 700,000 Australians are, at any given time, considered immunocompromised – through genetic causes, as organ recipients, undergoing treatments for cancer and some infections and simply age. Many in these groups are choosing to remain in self-imposed lockdown as Covid-19 precautions in public settings ease. Sydney-based musician Liz Martin, who has a lifelong auto-immune condition, understands why so many Australians are raring to go out and want things to get back to normal. “But we are still in a pandemic, and it would be great if we could keep a lot of these simple measures in place to help ensure the safety, health and wellbeing of people that are more vulnerable,” she said. “Many people with a disability aren’t attending events. It’s really impacting a lot of people who have to stay at home, they’re still in lockdown to look after their own health. They feel abandoned.” A recent survey of more than 8,000 Australians who had attended cultural events pre-Covid found that 59% felt they were now ready to go back “whenever permitted”. Among those classified as at risk of a serious health outcome from contracting Covid-19 and those with a disability, the percentages fell to 39% and 43% respectively. The study, released last month by culture and community sector researchers Patternmakers, also found that while almost 80% of respondents were satisfied with the safety measures event organisers had in place, one in 10 expressed concern that not enough was being done. Most states are continuing to enforce mandatory mask-wearing rules in high risk settings such as hospitals, aged care facilities, airports and public transport. But when it comes to entertainment, each state differs. In NSW, mask wearing and proof of vaccination is no longer required, though it is encouraged, at entertainment venues like cinemas, museums and live music venues. Masks remain compulsory at indoor music festivals with more than 1,000 attending, as do proof of vaccination certificates, however. In Victoria, proof of vaccination and checking in is still mandatory at entertainment venues. Mask wearing is not enforced, but “strongly recommended”, at crowded venues. “I don’t think people were sticking to the mask-wearing rules like they used to anyway,” said Melbourne musician Eliza Hull, who lives with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, a group of neurological disorders. “I noticed it as soon as it stopped being compulsory to wear masks in retail stores, that was when people stopped wearing them at live events and hospitality venues. I think a lot of people feel like they’ve done their part, and now they’re over it. “But I feel like masks are the one thing that we can do as a community to protect the most vulnerable communities. And it’s really hard for people with a disability to see people without masks on, it’s such a small price to pay to protect people with disabilities and people whose [health] is compromised.” The lack of uniformity in Victoria’s Covid-safe laws are a source of some irritation to the chief executive of Palace Cinemas, Benjamin Zeccola, who told the Guardian while his staff of more than 500 workers across 24 cinemas continue to wear masks for entire shifts, workers at events such as AFL games and the Australian Grand Prix were permitted to work maskless. “The strictest check-in requirements and vaccination enforcement requirements are in place in Victoria, under threat of ruinous fines, which is putting a strain on business and staff because it is expensive to monitor and monitoring causes conflict with customers, who rightly believe they shouldn’t have to check in any more … Victorians seem to have had enough, remonstrating with powerless customer service staff,” Zeccola said. In Western Australia, seated entertainment venues such as cinemas, theatres and stadiums remain capped at 75% capacity. Masks remain mandatory everywhere indoors, other than in the home, and proof of vaccination is still required to gain entry to most cultural and entertainment venues. Earlier this week, Silent Witness actor Liz Carr called for separate performances for vulnerable people, who still want fellow audience members to wear masks or socially distance. “Theatre should remain accessible even to those of us who have health conditions,” she said, speaking backstage at London’s Royal Albert Hall on Sunday after winning best supporting actress at the Olivier Awards. “If I’d had a five-minute speech, I would’ve talked about how I haven’t been to the theatre in over two years. This is a frightening night for me.” Carr, who lives with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and has used a wheelchair since childhood, said she felt safe on stage but would not feel comfortable in the audience. “I was on stage with everybody who was testing, everybody in the cast tested every day, so I felt safer than being a random member of the public in an audience around people I didn’t know,” she said. Matthew Hall, the chief executive of Arts Access Australia, said Carr’s idea of mask-only performances could be a valuable addition to the mix. He said he was surprised to see few masks being worn at recent Adelaide Fringe events he attended, and said it seemed bizarre that holding a drink while watching a performance excused an patron from donning their mask. “It’s an option, but it shouldn’t really be needed, if people just were sensible about wearing their masks, understanding that their behaviour is putting other people at risk,” he said. Martin said maintaining streamed performances, which many arts institutions introduced during lockdowns around the world, would also help make cultural events more accessible for those reluctant to risk Covid infection. “To see that stopping and people wanting to return to the way things were before and forgetting about all the things we’ve learned over the last couple of years, I find that very disappointing,” she said.",Arts/Culture,"‘People feel abandoned’: as masks come off, thousands of Australians feel scared to go out",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/14/people-feel-abandoned-as-masks-come-off-thousands-of-australians-feel-scared-to-go-out
4/15/2022,"More than 20 Ancient Greek artefacts that have never left the mediterranean country before will be displayed in Melbourne as part of an exhibition on the history of the civilisation’s legacy and its impact on modern culture. Melbourne Museum will exhibit 44 objects in total from the National Archeological Museum in Athens for its Open Horizons: Ancient Greek Journeys and Connections exhibition. The exhibit’s centrepiece is a 400-kilogram sculpture of the Greek god Zeus. A marble sphinx statue – excavated at Spata, in Attica, in the 19th century – is one of 23 artefacts that have never been displayed outside Greece before. Made during the Mature Archaic period, the statue is one of the earliest known Archaic Sphinxes. The pieces represent separate themes, guiding visitors through the ancient Greeks’ trading of ideas and goods and its influence on culture. The items date from the Early Bronze Age to the Roman period. Linda Sproul, director of exhibitions and experiences at Museums Victoria, said the exhibit told “a story of cultural exchange between and across peoples and communities”. “It’s actually looking at these objects afresh, to see what other stories these objects reveal in terms of how people lived with one another, and how they influenced one another,” she said. “This idea of people journeying and exchanging ideas and connections and trading together or having spiritual belief together, that didn’t stop 3,000 years ago. So the really wonderful thing about exhibitions like this is it allows you a chance to kind of step out of time, and to think about all of the time that humans have been around, and how there are connections across years, and centuries and millennia.” The state government secured Open Horizons following a trip by the premier, Dan Andrews, to Greece in 2017, which began the discussion with the previous government about improving cultural exchange between the two countries. The state government made a $2m investment in the exhibition in last year’s state budget. Oakleigh MP Steve Dimopoulos is one of five state parliamentarians with Greek heritage and he travelled with Andrews. He said the exhibit had a special significance for Victoria’s Greek diaspora, with the state home to the largest concentration of Greeks outside the country in the world. “Grandparents and parents can bring their children and grandchildren here to touch and feel the civilisation that they’ve so talked about and heard and been engrossed in. They don’t have to jump on a plane to Athens. They can see it right here in Carlton in Melbourne Museum,” he said. Kalliopi Tsakri, conservator of antiquities and works of art at the National Archaeological Museum, said all of the artefacts were transported using rubber-lined crates to ensure they were protected from road and aeroplane vibrations on their journey from Athens. Tsakri is part of the National Archaeological Museum’s team that travelled from Greece with the artefacts and has installed them in Melbourne.
