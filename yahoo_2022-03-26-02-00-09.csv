3/26/2022,"A Russian army commander has been killed by his own troops with a tank, with morale said to be running low during their invasion of Ukraine, Western officials have said. The commander of the 37th rifle brigade is understood to have been run over by one of his own soldiers who had grown frustrated by his unit's heavy losses. Russia is believed to be sending top leaders to the frontlines in a bid to bolster low morale among troops. A Western official said: “We believe he was killed by his own troops deliberately. ""Indeed, we believe he was run over by his own troops. And I believe he was the commander of the 37th Motor Rifle Brigade.” They added it is believed he was killed as a ""consequence of the scale of losses that had been taken by his brigade. The commander was named by an Estonian politician as Colonel Yuri Medvechek. Russia has yet to officially confirm the death of Colonel Medvechek.

The MoD said this morning that Russia is losing ground, allowing Ukrainian forces to reclaim certain key towns and positions just 20 miles from Kyiv. Ukrainian authorities have claimed between 10-15,000 Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine - which if true would be the highest toll since the Second World War.

An anonymous officer from Nato said on Wednesday that battlefield casualties suffered by Russia are thought to total between 30,000 and 40,000 since Putin launched his invasion on February 24. British military intelligence said on Thursday that ""Russian forces have almost certainly suffered thousands of casualties during their invasion of Ukraine."" In an effort to bolster their troops, Russia is likely looking at bringing reservists and conscription, further intelligence has suggested. The Russian President is said to be frustrated at the lack of progress, which has seen his troops fail to seize any major cities despite heavy bombardment of them. Russian state journalists were told the invasion of Ukraine would be over in two weeks, a whistleblower has claimed. Speaking anonymously to ITV News, a journalist for the Russia 1 television channel said they were initially told the war would be over by 8 March, then they would be able to go back to their ""normal work"". But a week after that date passed, Russian security chiefs admitted that the conflict was not going ""as fast as we would like"". The journalist's comments come as Russian efforts to take Ukraine continue to stall, a month after the invasion. On Friday, a Ministry of Defence (MoD) intelligence update said Ukrainian forces were reclaiming key towns and positions up to 21 miles (35km) east of Kyiv as Russian forces lose ground.

3/26/2022,"Russian President Vladimir Putin will likely be forced to bring his failing war against Ukraine to a halt, a former US general told Insider. ""The reason is not because he wants to halt his military operation, but because he has no choice,"" retired US Army Brig. Gen. Kevin Ryan said. Putin, said Ryan, ""has basically reached the capacity of what his military can do for him in Ukraine."" Russian President Vladimir Putin will likely be forced to bring his failing more-than-month-long war against Ukraine to a halt, a former US general and Russia specialist told Insider — a scenario that could happen within weeks after Russian forces have sustained heavy losses and subjected Ukraine's cities to indiscriminate attacks. Retired US Army Brig. Gen. Kevin Ryan said he believes this to be the ""most likely scenario"" to play out as Putin has already ""failed to accomplish"" his ""main military goals"" in Ukraine — a lightning strike to seize Kyiv and other big cities and remove its elected leaders — and Russia's economy continues to be decimated by sweeping Western sanctions over its war with the eastern European country. ""Putin will have to halt his war in Ukraine sooner or later and probably in a matter of weeks,"" Ryan, who served as Defense Attaché to Russia for the US among numerous other roles, told Insider on Thursday. ""The reason is not because he wants to halt his military operation, but because he has no choice,"" Ryan, 67, said. ""He has basically reached the capacity of what his military can do for him in Ukraine."" Ukraine's armed forces — aided by civilians — have been greatly outnumbered and outgunned by Russian troops since Russia launched its attack in late February, but Ukrainians have managed to put up a fierce resistance, resulting in a mounting Russian death toll and an essentially stalled invasion. An assessment from the Institute for Study of War found that Ukrainian forces have forced Russian troops into defensive positions while Putin's forces have ""continued to settle in for a protracted and stalemated conflict."" Ryan said the Russian army ""has a huge personnel problem."" ""There is no significant military unit left in Russia outside of Ukraine. They are all in the fight,"" he said, adding, ""There is almost no part of the Russian military that's not dedicated, committed to Ukraine, so if [Putin] has to escalate, how does he escalate?"" At this point, Ryan said, it would be ""impossible"" for Russia to take control of all of Ukraine like Putin hoped to. ""He does not have the military forces to take all of Ukraine and occupy it,"" Ryan said, noting that the ""Russian leadership overestimated what their military was capable of."" Ryan called this ""a great achievement by Ukrainian people to have prevented an overthrow of their government and a total seizure of all their land."" Russian troops first invaded Ukraine on February 24 and in the weeks since, they have surrounded and shelled several towns across the eastern European country, hitting multiple civilian targets, including residential buildings, hospitals, and a theater. But British intelligence revealed on Friday that thanks to Ukrainian counterattacks, Ukraine had re-occupied some areas it lost earlier in the war around the capital city of Kyiv. Ryan, a senior fellow at Harvard's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, said that he believes Ukraine will see ""an increase in violence"" by Russian forces ""in the near future"" until Putin is forced to halt his military operation. Putin ""can increase the violence and do more damage and destruction in Ukraine,"" Ryan said. ""He can try to find and encircle and destroy the Ukrainian military, which is smaller than his,"" said Ryan. ""But even if he does all of those things, he cannot strategically do much more with his military."" ""They're out of troops, they're out of units, they are fully committed to doing just what they are now,"" he said. Ryan, however, noted that the potential halting of the war in Ukraine ""doesn't necessarily mean a halt in violence."" ""Violence can continue even during the time of negotiations between the sides,"" Ryan said, explaining that the halting of the invasion would likely be ""indefinite"" until Putin ""gets enough concessions from Ukraine"" and even from the West regarding the severe sanctions on Russia. ""So until he gets enough concessions,"" Ryan said of Putin, ""I think he would want to stay in that kind of no man's land of a halted military operation — one that could be restarted at any time. ""That would be the threat.""

3/26/2022,"A jury in Iowa has awarded a $97.4 million verdict after a baby’s head was crushed during an “egregious” child birth, according to the family’s legal team. Parents Andrew and Kathleen Kromphardt filed the medical malpractice lawsuit against two medical facilities involved in the delivery of their baby, Scotty,/ in 2018, The Gazette reported. “The acts of malpractice committed by OBGYN Associates of Iowa City and Mercy Hospital were egregious,” attorney Geoffrey Fieger said in a news release. “As a result of their malpractice by improperly delivering a baby with forceps and a vacuum, and crushing his head, producing permanent brain damage. They not only destroyed the life of the little baby, Scotty, but his entire family who must care for him for the rest of his life.” This birth trauma verdict comes after a 14-day court trial and a 90-minute jury deliberation, according to The Gazette. “Mercy Iowa City is disappointed in the verdict. While we respect the legal process, we disagree with the jury’s conclusion and will consider all available options,” the medical center said in a statement to McClatchy News. “Our primary focus remains on providing high quality care to our patients and families.” In a similar statement, a spokesperson with OB/GYN Associates of Iowa City said that “while we have great respect for the legal process, we are disappointed in the jury’s finding. We are reviewing our legal options moving forward.” The Kromphardt couple and their legal team believe their doctor had time to switch from a vaginal birth to a cesarean section, but because the doctor chose not to, their baby’s skull was fractured, according to KCRG. The $97.4 million verdict, expected to be divided evenly between the two medical facilities, is expected to cover medical care, loss of earnings, and pain and suffering, the TV station reported. A legal expert says the family may not see the full verdict amount, adding that the defense can file an appeal, according to The Gazette. The judge can also lower the award if he doesn’t believe evidence supports the dollar amount. “We are proud to fight for the rights of this family and help get them the compensation they deserve,” Fieger Law said. 50 women sue OB-GYN, accusing doctor of sexually abusing them during Utah appointments Dad learns daughter isn’t biologically his after a sperm mix-up, Ohio lawsuit says She asked for maternity leave.

 Ukraine's Armed Forces revised earlier comments they had made about which Russian landing ship they claimed Ukrainian forces had destroyed. ""In the Azov operational zone, according to updated information, a large landing ship 'Saratov' was destroyed during the attack on the occupied Berdyansk port. Large landing ships 'Caesar Kunikov' and 'Novocherkassk' were damaged. Other losses of the enemy are being clarified,"" the Ukrainian military said on Friday in a statement on Facebook. Previously, the Ukrainian military claimed it had destroyed the Orsk in Russian-occupied Berdyansk, which sits in the southern region of Ukraine, The Washington Post reported. The newspaper noted that the incident was not immediately commented on by Russia. The development comes as the Russian invasion in Ukraine extends into its second month, with Russian forces remaining unsuccessful in their efforts to capture Ukrainian capital Kyiv. A senior military official from NATO told several news outlets earlier this week, citing information from Ukrainian officials, that as many as 40,000 Russian soldiers have died, been taken prisoner, gone missing or been wounded. Within that figure, NATO believes between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian soldiers have died since Feb. 24. Meanwhile, Russia has provided slimmer estimates of the number of soldiers and troops lost, with the Russian defense ministry saying on Friday that it had lost close to 1,400 soldiers, with another nearly 4,000 wounded, the Post reported, noting it could not verify those numbers. Russia has previously provided estimates of its military casualties much lower than that of other international estimates, and it has not provided regular updates on the figures amid the invasion.",World/The Hill,Ukrainian military clarifies which Russian landing ship it destroyed,https://news.yahoo.com/ukrainian-military-clarifies-russian-landing-145504957.html
