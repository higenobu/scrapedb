1/1/2022,"After a few minutes in the queue spent eyeing up the best on offer at the local deli, it is decision time. Maybe some of the wonderful Parma ham from Italy? With a few slices of Spanish chorizo? And a piece of brie from that farm in Normandy… oh, and definitely some of the black olives from Greece.  The government may be making light of new and burdensome Brexit rules and regulations affecting imports to the UK from the EU which came into force on January 1, but organisations representing small UK firms are not. The firms are worried about the impact on their businesses – and about the choices that will be available to their customers at their favourite specialist stores – on the high street. The Federation of Small Businesses cites local delicatessens, many of which import from small specialist suppliers in the EU, as the type of operators that could be adversely affected. “The classic example is your high street deli that is importing delicacies like, say, chorizo from Spain or parmesan from Italy,” says James Sibley, the federation’s head of international affairs. “For them, the thought of having to register for these systems is daunting and the process is expensive, so we’ve a lot of concern there. For those small businesses directly affected, we have picked up a lot of worry.” The hit to small EU exporters to the UK could be similar to that experienced by UK exporters to the EU over the past year, many of which simply gave up selling goods to the continent because post-Brexit export rules made it too much of a bother and too expensive to carry on. From the beginning of last year UK exporters faced extra paperwork, and added costs, and their customers were stung by resulting higher prices – despite the claims by Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and other Brexiteers that leaving the EU would reduce regulation and lead to lower prices. Now, Sibley says, the effects could be similar for small UK importers to those that faced UK exporters in 2021. “It is the inverse of what has happened to UK exporters over the past year. We know that a fifth of our exporting members have stopped exporting to the EU, because of that disruption.” Rules that came into force January 1 require businesses (in most cases those receiving the goods in the UK, but in some those sending them here) to notify the customs authorities of precisely what is being sent to the UK from the EU, and from where. The rules were in effect waived throughout 2021. The process will require the exporter to acquire and then submit an Eori number (economic operators registration and identification number) to their UK customers so the importers can then input a lot of data and send it off to the UK authorities. If the goods arrive with incomplete paperwork, they can be seized, confiscated or sent back. Sibley says there is evidence that many EU exporters are unprepared for what is about to hit them. “What we are hearing is that there are some EU traders who are not ready for any of this even to the extent of not having this number, so that is a concern.” Then on 1 July this year, more regulations and checks will come in. “From then, exporters will also need export health certificates or veterinary certificates if they are exporting products of animal origin or foodstuffs. That is a point at which some EU exporters might just say, ‘You know what, forget this. It is not worth the hassle’.” Sibley adds: “Also in July you will have physical inspections of goods at border posts in the UK, so again that could lead to delays because you will essentially have a vet with a clipboard going through the lorry saying ‘this is right, this is fine, (or not)’.” Business groups say the problems will affect mainly smaller operators, as bigger concerns can afford to pay customs agents or freight forwarders to handle the paperwork for them. On UK high streets, some shop owners are already worrying about gaps appearing on their shelves in 2022, and about rising prices. El Colmado, Bristol’s only Spanish deli, imports pretty much everything: chorizo sausages, huge serrano hams and glossy, green olives. Its owner, David Pavon, expects more disruption and rising prices when importers are required to make the real-time custom declarations, input details of food imports into various customs systems, and obtain special codes for lorries to board ferries. “Logistics problems have increased during the past year already because of the havoc coming into England,” he says. “So I imagine in January we’re going to see even more delays, because if a lorry driver needs to sit in the border for six hours or more, we will need to pay his wages. We are paying customs agents in Spain and here to input the information [required for import], which increases the price as well.” Pavon, 41, has already put his prices up – and expects to have to do so again in 2022. “They are still going up and you will see an increase and an increase,” he says. “Someone is making money along the way but you and me are going to have to pay for it.” The wholesalers supplying delis and specialist food shops have similar worries. Reading-based Cotswold Fayre, which supplies hundreds of premium food lines, including European favourites such as stollen and panettone, to independent retailers throughout the UK, has been forced to budget for delays and cost increases on imported goods instead of investing in creating new jobs. “It’s not what we want to do – I would rather spend on starting another shop, but if we have to we will [absorb extra costs],” says Paul Hargreaves, the company’s founder. Hargreaves, who recently met his local MP, Alok Sharma, feels that the government does not understand the impact of Brexit on British businesses. “[Ministers] are not in the real world. They think things are a lot easier than they actually are. That is highly frustrating,” he says. “If they had to experience it for themselves, perhaps there might have been a bit more effort to do a better Brexit deal. The perception is that the ideology [of Brexit] is more important than the practicalities to businesses in the UK.”",News/Politics,UK shops fear gaps on shelves as new Brexit import rules hit,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/01/uk-shops-fear-gaps-shelves-brexit-import-rules-prices-shortages-delis
1/1/2022,"The John Williams score plays (with added bells for the festive season), the camera soars above an ersatz Victorian street, wax-sealed letters appear – and just like that, anyone who came of reading or viewing age from 1997 onwards is home. The Harry Potter reunion special Return to Hogwarts, marking 20 years since the first film adaptation of JK Rowling’s gamechanging and multi-multi-million-selling fantasy series about the boy wizard was released, hews as closely to the original’s aesthetic as possible from the off. Chats among the three main stars, Daniel Radcliffe (Harry himself), Emma Watson (Hermione Granger) and Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley), take place in the Gryffindor common room, there’s an opening set piece in the Hogwarts dining hall, Radcliffe and director of the first two films, Chris Columbus, talk in Dumbledore’s office and so on. It provides a rush of nostalgia only heightened as the enduring affection among them all becomes evident. There is much – rising perilously if perhaps inevitably close to emetic levels – of the cast and crew being like a family. There always is in programmes like this, but at least here it is more than usually justified. The actors famously began working on the franchise when they were children, and their audience grew up alongside them pretty much in real time as the films were released between 2001 and 2011.  One of what you might assume to be a central member of the family, however, is conspicuous by her absence – the creator of Harry Potter and his world, the author JK Rowling. An essay she published in 2020 giving her views on the impact of gender ideology on women’s rights was widely denounced as transphobic. Radcliffe, Grint and Watson distanced themselves from her. According to her agents, the controversy played no part in her decision not to take part in the reunion and she felt that the 2019 interview footage of her used here (mostly recalling the difficulty of finding someone to play Harry) would be presence enough. Whatever the true degree of her choice in the matter, and despite various fond mentions of “Jo” from Radcliffe and others throughout the special, a void remains. But around it there is charm, warmth, charisma – especially when Helena Bonham Carter (Bellatrix Lestrange) blows in like the world’s most glorious hurricane – and even a little new information amid well-worn anecdotes. Yes, we hear again how Alfonso Cuarón, who directed the third Potter film, made the central trio write essays about their characters and true to form, Watson handed in a perfect dozen pages, Radcliffe mustered half a side of A4 and Grint didn’t bother. But we also hear about Alan Rickman getting the inside line from Rowling early on about Snape’s ultimate motivation and telling not a soul, Watson’s growing loneliness as the pressures on her grew greater, and about the deep fondness between Watson and Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) and the crush Radcliffe had on Bonham Carter. There are also moments of tangential insight, into the scale of the endeavour (such as when one of the three remembers being told that the casting announcement would be made that afternoon and that the media would descend – “So you can’t go home”), and Radcliffe’s maturity beyond his years from the start. He makes several references to watching the likes of Ralph Fiennes, Gary Oldman, Timothy Spall and many others from the British thespian firmament doing “proper acting”, and his longing to and delight in learning from them is still palpable. It is a slick and calculated production, designed to give Potterheads exactly what they want, how they want it. But it contains enough untold stories and honesty from the participants and unfakeable camaraderie to give it more genuine heart than probably anyone expected. Perhaps in another 20 years they will let Rowling back in, too.",Arts/Television & radio,Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts review – perilously close to emetic,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/01/harry-potter-20th-anniversary-return-to-hogwarts-review-perilously-close-to-emetic
1/1/2022,"Ihave asthma, and there’s a fairly major respiratory disease going around, as you may have heard, and also I am a smoker. A quick inventory of my coat pockets: inhaler, face mask, Marlboro Gold. I never fell into smoking as a teenager when everyone else seemed to think it was cool, but took it up in my 30s, as others might develop an interest in birdwatching, or CrossFit. Four or five a day, for the best part of a decade, and more at the weekends. This piece is anonymous because my mother cannot know. I don’t have the words to express how unbelievably stupid I feel about all this. There’s quite a lot going on here, and not all of it is solely of interest to me and my therapist. You might imagine that a continuing and lung-buggering international emergency which a study says is specifically more dangerous for smokers would mean there were fewer idiots like me. But in fact, stress and boredom are more than a match for serious health concerns: research published in August last year suggested that the number of young adults smoking in England went up by about a quarter during the first lockdown. There was a spike in the number of people across all ages giving up smoking in England during that same first lockdown period – but no sign of the plummeting rates you might rationally expect. Then again, nothing about this habit has ever been rational.  For my own part, I don’t know exactly what kind of smoker I am, but I know I’m not casual, or social: I’m highly committed to something very unpopular. The persistence of the packet in my pocket is not for the want of trying. It’s more for a want of wanting. My figurative heart just isn’t in it, although my literal heart would probably have quite strong opinions in the opposite direction. (Unlucky, literal heart, only sentient organs get a vote!) I don’t suppose I speak for the other 1.1bn people still grimly puffing away, but it feels as if my problem is that I still, somewhere in my lizard brain, think this habit that makes me smell awful and look desperate is … cool, a deftly executed little ritual that makes me a more compelling figure to people at a party. Did you feel cool when you were a teenager, my therapist asks, and it’s obvious to us both that the question is a rhetorical one. That makes a grim sort of sense, but it’s probably also a crutch, and a way to ignore the obvious fact that I’m addicted. After all, I’ve barely been to any parties for quite a long time and, apart from the neighbour’s terminally unimpressed cat, there’s no audience when I’m huddled in the back garden on a rainy Tuesday morning getting ash on myself. I started, for reasons I don’t fully understand, as some sort of warped, bloody-minded reinvention shortly after a breakup. I should have known from my permanent inability to leave half a pack of sweets in a cupboard for the next day that it wouldn’t work; before long I had slipped from a pack a month to one every few days. I wish I had properly understood then how insidious an addiction nicotine would turn out to be, how misleading and unhelpful the term “craving” would prove, at least for me: it suggests a siren in your brain when you go without, when the truth is something more like the little fillip you get when it occurs to you that you’d like a cup of tea and a biscuit. I don’t often leave it long enough to be faced with a more powerful compulsion than that, but because it doesn’t seem especially intense, I almost always give in to it. I think I have a constitutional weakness for treats. I still don’t think I really, deeply, want to stop, or understand how urgently I have to. But I know I don’t want this bleak internal monologue motoring in my head any more: an endless, boring chunter that slides into my mind any time I’m not thinking about anything much. It may be that the pandemic’s additional opportunities for mental drift has helped me reach at least this caveated breakthrough, because in 2021 I started Juul-ing. Whereas previous attempts failed spectacularly – the time I lit up while chewing Nicorette is a particular low point – this time, I’ve gone more than a week between cigarettes, at the cost of an umbilical attachment to a mysterious little obelisk whose long-term impacts remain unknown. I buy menthol vape pods in bulk and feel nervous if the battery light blinks red. I always come back to smoking in the end, but the gaps are getting a bit longer, and a bit easier to tolerate. None of this is consoling. Helpful though the vaping is, and good though I feel about smoking less, I seem to be stuck on it as a harm-reduction method, not a step towards kicking the habit. I tell myself that once all this – I am waving my hands at the universe – has eased off a little, I’ll really get on with it. The prospect of slowly killing myself is fixed as an abstraction. I feel I’d stop if I were having a kid, but that might just be another rationalisation for putting it off. So here I am, the sort of person who vapes behind their hand in Zoom meetings, and blows a conspicuous little cloud out of the corner of his mouth as if anyone’s not going to notice it because it comes out sideways. I miss being the person I was before I smoked, when I had no idea how much of a luxury it was never to have thought about it, and I know that even if I succeed in giving up nicotine completely, that victory will be shadowed by an obscure sense of loss. I also can’t believe how much less funny this piece is than I meant it to be. But maybe, two years into a global pandemic, that counts for personal growth: the ability to face the absurdity of the harm you are doing to yourself as something more consequential than a morbid joke.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Can’t quit, won’t quit: confessions of a die-hard smoker",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/01/cant-quit-wont-quit-confessions-of-a-die-hard-smoker
1/1/2022,"Paul Thomas Anderson’s ninth cinematic symphony hits UK screens next week: Licorice Pizza returns the director to his native LA’s San Fernando Valley in the 1970s, previously seen in his 1997 breakout Boogie Nights. The latter tackled the era’s porn scene, the new effort is a more wholesome coming-of-age story (Funny! Relaxed! Delectable! says the Guardian) – some have dubbed it “Boogie Days”. Newcomers Cooper Hoffman and Alana Haim lead the line.  Alana Haim is a member of the sister-based pop rock group Haim. The trio has long been associated with Anderson, who has directed several of their music videos. But it turns out the sisters’ mother, Donna Rose, was his elementary school art teacher – “a huge influence”, he says. As well as inspiring a modern auteur, Donna was a winning entrant on The Gong Show; she sang a Bonnie Raitt number – no gongs! (Husband Moti, meanwhile, was once a professional footballer; those Haims contain multitudes.) Chuck Barris was the host of The Gong Show and creator of other trash telly: in 1984 he infamously wrote an “unauthorised autobiography”, dubiously claiming he had been a CIA assassin. With Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, George Clooney turned the tall story into his underrated 2002 directorial debut(rent it everywhere). Charlie Kaufman wrote the screenplay – though later voiced his disapproval. Kaufman’s own directorial debut was the mind-bending Synecdoche, New York, with Philip Seymour Hoffman as a theatre director whose work swallows his world. Hoffman was also a muse to Anderson across several films (is Punch-Drunk Love quietly their best?), until his death in 2014. Now his son Cooper has picked up the PTA baton (usually we’re dubious of nepotism, but maybe we can wave this through).

1/1/2022,"Pope Francis used his new year’s message to call for an end to violence against women, saying it was an insult to God. Celebrating mass in St Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican, on the day the Roman Catholic church marks both the solemnity of Holy Mary Mother of God as well as its annual World Day of Peace, Francis wove his New Year’s homily around the themes of motherhood and women, saying it was they who kept the threads of life together.  And he used the message to make one of his strongest pleas yet for an end to violence against them. “And since mothers bestow life, and women keep the world (together), let us all make greater efforts to promote mothers and to protect women,” he said. “How much violence is directed against women. Enough. To hurt a woman is to insult God, who from a woman took on our humanity - not through an angel, not directly, but through a woman.” Pope Francis, 85, has spoken out in recent times about domestic violence. Last month, during an Italian television programme he told a woman who had been beaten by her ex-husband that men who commit violence against women engage in something that is “almost satanic”. Pope Francis appeared to be in good form on Saturday following an unexplained incident on New Year’s Eve where he attended a service but at the last minute did not preside over it as had been expected. At the start of the mass, he walked the entire length of the central aisle of the basilica, as opposed to Friday night, when he emerged from a side entrance close to the altar and watched from the sidelines. The pontiff suffers from a sciatica condition that causes pain in the legs, and sometimes a flare up prevents him from standing for long periods. Public participation at the mass was lower than in past years because of Covid restrictions, according to reports. In the Pope’s Message for the World Day of Peace, issued last month, Francis said nations should divert money spent on armaments to invest in education, and lamented growing military costs at the expense of social services. The annual peace message is sent to heads of state and international organisations. The pope also gives a signed copy to leaders who make official visits to him at the Vatican during the upcoming year.",News/World news,Pope calls for end to violence against women in new year message,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/01/pope-calls-for-end-to-violence-against-women-in-new-year-message
1/1/2022,"The mother of two sisters murdered in a London park said she wants to meet one of the police officers who took selfies at the scene and shared the images. The Ven Mina Smallman, the first black woman to become an archdeacon in the Church of England, who was guest editing BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, also spoke of the pain of losing her daughters Nicole Smallman, 27, and Bibaa Henry, 46, in June 2020.  Deniz Jaffer, 47, and Jamie Lewis, 33, who were serving Metropolitan police officers, had been ordered to guard the murder scene. However, it emerged they had taken photos, some showing the bodies, and shared them in two WhatsApp groups. Jaffer resigned from the Met in August, while Lewis was sacked by a disciplinary tribunal. Last month Jaffer and Lewis were each jailed for two years and nine months. Danyal Hussein,19, was jailed for life in October – with a minimum of 35 years – for the murder of the sisters. Smallman said she had forgiven him. Since her daughters’ deaths, she has campaigned on violence against women and for equity on how victims are seen. When asked what she felt about a police system that produced and allowed two serving officers to photograph her daughters as they did, she replied: “I’m repulsed by them, if I’m honest, and I can’t wait to meet Jaffa. “He said he’d like to meet with the family and I don’t believe he thought that that could happen, but it will because he said he wants it to happen. I’m going to give him that invitation.” The family have planted a cherry tree at Fryent Country Park in north-west London, where the women were murdered. In October the Met police apologised to the family for failing in the way it responded when the two women were reported missing following an investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). It found a missing persons log was incorrectly closed and inquiries were not progressed. The Met commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, said a better response would have saved their family and friends “immeasurable pain”. Smallman told the Today programme “having to fight to find your own children” was horrendous. Asked by presenter Mishal Husain if the guilty verdicts had allowed her now to “turn a page in some way”, Smallman said: “No, not yet. I think it is probably too soon. I’m looking forward to that time when we can just start grieving. But we don’t know what that looks like yet. “I’ve said once before, it’d be great to have no news, good or bad. We just would like a flat line, just to gather speed and to find our way through the grieving process.” She added that there had been times when she no longer wanted to “be here” and that they had been “dreading” Christmas, but added her campaigning had helped her. “If anything this has kept me going,” she explained. “This has given me a reason to stay with it and try and ensure that another family doesn’t have to go through what we’ve been through.”",News/UK news,Mother of murdered sisters hopes to meet PC jailed for crime scene photos,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/01/mother-of-murdered-sisters-hopes-to-meet-pc-jailed-for-scene-photos
1/1/2022,"Twice a week, in rural Cambridgeshire, Rebecca Lee hires a private field for her dog, Moscow, to run about in for an hour. “Moscow is the world’s most difficult dog,” she said. “If you’ve got a dog like him, who is reactive – he barks and lunges at stuff, mostly because he’s actually quite fearful – then every walk can be traumatic.” By contrast, when she rents the field, she can relax, knowing they are not going to encounter any of Moscow’s “triggers”. These include other dogs, bikes, cars and children.  Lee is just one of the thousands of dog owners across the country who regularly hires private land to exercise their pet. The website, dogwalkingfields.com, estimates that about 2,270 acres – the equivalent of 1,700 football pitches – is being used for this purpose via the 756 fields in its directory, with more added each week. “During the pandemic, enclosed fields became a refuge for people who wanted to exercise their dogs away from other people, socially distanced,” said Katherine Shields Smith, co-founder of Dog Walking Fields. “Open spaces were crowded, especially with travel restrictions in place. As restrictions lifted a little, the fields became safe havens to meet up with friends and family and exercise safely.” The fields typically cost about £10 an hour and are usually surrounded by secure fencing. They are used by owners whose dogs are anxious, injured, disabled, reactive, small, elderly, in season or in training. “The owners of these dogs all appreciate somewhere safe to relax off lead without being approached by other possibly well-meaning but exuberant dogs,” said Shields Smith. In a public place, unsolicited and often unwelcome approaches can cause some owners and dogs distress, leading to conflict – but there is a lack of awareness about this and other aspects of “dog walking etiquette”, she said: “There are lots of dogs who are friendly but whose owners have no control over them.” This problem has worsened during the pandemic, with a lot more inexperienced owners around. Parks and open spaces have become crowded with “pandemic puppies” – many born during lockdown, when puppy training classes were closed and most dog owners were social distancing. Many of these dogs are now poorly socialised adolescents with behaviour problems: over the past six months, animal charities have seen a substantial increase in “lockdown pet regret”, with the RSPCA reporting abandonments are up by 20% in 2021 compared with the previous year’s figures. Ben Webster, a farmer in Coton, near Cambridge, spent £15,000 turning one of his fields into a secure dog field last year. He used to rent it out for sheep grazing for £300 a year. Now, during the summer peak, he can earn up to £400 a week. “You get a whole mix of people. As well as the owners of dogs who are a bit nervous or not terribly well trained, you get dog-training classes. And you get people in the summer who want to just come, have a glass of wine in the field and let their dogs run around while they sit with friends on the bench and chat for an hour, knowing their dogs will be safe and secure.” The field has a tunnel dogs can run through, tyres they can jump over and a water tap. “In the summer, some people brought paddling pools for their dogs and we had dog parties,” said Webster. Moscow was born during the first lockdown and given up to a rescue centre by his previous owners when they stopped working from home. “He hadn’t had a lead or a collar on him until he was six months old,” said Lee, an author. “I don’t think he’d ever been walked on the pavement. And I think that led to a lot of his issues.” Lee sought the help of a dog behaviourist and started using secure dog fields near her home. This gave her a large, safe space for Moscow. “We are making lots of progress. He can now go on group walks with a dog walker and is great with other dogs he knows.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Field day for dogs as owners pay by the hour for safe green spaces,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/01/field-day-for-dogs-as-owners-pay-by-the-hour-for-safe-green-spaces
