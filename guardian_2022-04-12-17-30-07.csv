4/12/2022,"An investigation has been launched after claims that Home Office contractors paid for sex while deporting people abroad, the Guardian has learned. Five whistleblowers have said some colleagues regularly paid sex workers on overnight stopovers over a period of 10 years after accompanying migrants on flights from the UK. It is understood that the Home Office permanent secretary, Matthew Rycroft, has raised concerns about the allegations with the firm Mitie, which has held the contract to manage deportations since May 2018. Mitie said it was conducting a full investigation into the claims and had so far found no evidence that the behaviour had occurred since it took on the contract. The allegations have prompted charities to criticise the Home Office for allowing taxpayers’ “hard earned money” to be used for “predatory sex tourism”. The whistleblowers have passed the Guardian a dozen names of colleagues they say paid sex workers over the course of a decade. They claim this happened in cities including Nairobi in Kenya, Johannesburg in South Africa, Hanoi in Vietnam, Rio de Janeiro in Brazil and Bucharest in Romania. One Home Office contractor said they had been shocked at what they had seen while escorting people overseas. “On one job, two of us sat in the bar while three of the others in the team went off with [sex workers],” they said. “One had a phone which he called his ‘little black book’ specially for jobs abroad to arrange these liaisons.” Another contractor said: “The money paid by these Home Office contractors using sex workers while abroad doing deportations goes further than it would in the UK. But it is taxpayers’ money being used to fly us to these places where sex is being paid for,” they said. A third contractor told the Guardian: “This practice among Home Office contractors has gone on for as long as I can remember … A lot of hotels, especially in places like Nairobi, are full of prostitutes and they are cheap. It’s a thing some of the men do because it’s there, it’s available.” Stephen Kinnock, Labour’s immigration spokesperson, described the reports as deeply disturbing and called on the Home Office to investigate the allegations immediately. Bella Sankey, the director of Detention Action, said: “The deportation industry wastes millions of taxpayer pounds to rip loving families apart and leave thousands of British children growing up in poverty. It is rubbing salt in that wound to learn that the Home Office’s contractors may have been engaged in predatory sex tourism while abroad on our hard-earned money.” Steve Valdez-Symonds, Amnesty International UK’s refugee and migrant rights director, said the latest allegations drew attention to the need for the Home Office to critically reassess its use of private contractors to carry out immigration tasks. “Contracting out requires serious effort to ensure continued Home Office responsibility for these tasks is made real in practice; and it must never be treated as a means of avoiding accountability,” he said. A Mitie spokesperson said: “The group’s senior management recently became aware of allegations relating to anonymous and historic claims regarding inappropriate behaviour by a small number of employees working on the Overseas Escorting contract. We have not been provided with evidence to substantiate these claims, nor have any details of specific instances been shared with us. However, given the serious nature of these allegations, we have been conducting an investigation. “To date, we have found no evidence that this behaviour occurred during our time managing this contract, which commenced in May 2018. We have strict professional standards, underpinned by a rigorous code of conduct, which employees must adhere to at all times when on company business. Any employees found to fall short of these standards will be subject to disciplinary action.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “We take all reports of sexual exploitation extremely seriously and if these disturbing allegations are proven, we expect Mitie to take swift and robust action. We have instructed Mitie to provide us with a full account of their investigation. We expect the highest standards of behaviour from our suppliers, both in the UK and overseas, and if we find any wrongdoing has taken place, we will always act in the strongest possible terms.”",News/Politics,Home Office contractors accused of paying for sex while deporting migrants,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/12/home-office-contractors-accused-of-paying-for-sex-while-deporting-migrants
4/12/2022,"Here is a really well-made, old-fashioned anti-war epic in a forthright and robustly enjoyable style from director and co-writer Arthur Harari. I can imagine David Lean or Steven Spielberg making this, or even John Sturges or J Lee Thompson, and it becoming the kind of movie that would get shown every Christmas on TV. It’s inspired by the life of Japanese intelligence officer Hiroo Onoda, who during the second world war had trained as a commando with orders to hold Lubang island in the Philippines and never to surrender or take his own life. Fiercely loyal to these original instructions, and refusing to believe the war was over, he held out as a hermit-guerrilla until 1974, as his ragtag unit died off or surrendered one by one, before he finally returned to Japan; one of the very last refuseniks. This movie shows the deeply strange existence of Onoda (played as a young recruit by Yûya Endô and as an older man by Kanji Tsuda). He is a Crusoe of fanatical military spirit enacting his own private parody of war. Or maybe an absurdist farce that reveals what war actually is. In the early years, he and his unit roam around the island with the colonial zeal of explorers or schoolboys, making a map and solemnly naming peaks and riverbanks, the enemy’s assumed presence preventing them from collapsing into Lord-of-the-Flies disorder. Onoda talks with his comrades about how it feels to get one’s first killshot – a killshot that actually happens after the surrender in which Onoda stoutly disbelieves; that all-important technicality that would magically transform an act of war into an act of murder. Onoda unhesitatingly burns the Filipino farmers’ crops and shoots them: actions entirely justified by the war in his head, and also of course by the Filipinos’ retaliatory actions, which only confirm his view. As the 1950s and 60s roll by, Onoda is alone and the authorities send his family to plead with him via a loudhailer; he thinks that’s just a trick. They leave him magazines and newspapers showing that the war is over. For Onoda it’s fake news. Yet he is no Mr Kurtz and he is more than a Mishima-type poseur: at the very end, there is something moving in his weary, impassive, uncomprehending childlike-old-man innocence.  Onoda: 10,000 Nights in the Jungle is released on 15 April in cinemas.",Arts/Film,"Onoda: 10,000 Nights in the Jungle review – Japanese soldier’s never-ending war",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/12/onoda-10000-nights-in-the-jungle-review-never-ending-war-hiroo-onoda
4/12/2022,"When Yasmin Hussain was a child growing up in Manchester in the 1990s, she was football mad. At first she played the sport with boys, but when she turned 13 her parents told her she needed to find a women’s team to continue. The problem was, there wasn’t one. At that time, women’s football was a niche sport rarely depicted on screen. When Bend It Like Beckham came out in 2002 – telling the story of Jesminder and her battle to play football against the wishes of her parents – Hussain was left thinking: “She’s lucky, she had a team to join. I didn’t have one.” Twenty years later, fans are celebrating the anniversary of the groundbreaking film on Tuesday and looking forward to the biggest ever year for women’s football in the UK as England host the Euros this summer. When Bend It Like Beckham came out, women’s football was not a professional sport and rarely appeared on television. This year, tickets for the final at Wembley sold out within an hour. But the film ignited an early spark for many women, and especially British Asians, who saw their own experiences of wanting to play the game but struggling to find a way to reflected for the first time. The landscape has since changed dramatically. In 2020, the Football Association reported that 3.4 million girls and women now play football, and a 54% increase in affiliated women’s and girls’ teams since 2017. Football is now the most popular sport among women and girls in the UK. These figures are partly due to the FA’s aggressive “gameplan for growth”, which includes the “let girls play” campaign aimed at encouraging all schools to offer women’s football on the curriculum. Hussain’s experience mirrors the trajectory of women’s football: after giving up the game, she trained as a coach five years ago, aged 33, reluctant to abandon “the only thing that gives me joy”. She now coaches Frenford & MSA, a recently setup team of 80 female players, many of whom are of south Asian heritage and have gone from worrying that “nobody else looked like us” to feeling “part of the family” in their grassroots league in east London. Role models and representation are an important theme of the film, and are the focus of a new documentary from BBC Sport to mark its anniversary. It is a passion project for the journalist Miriam Walker-Khan, who examines the legacy of the film for a generation of female athletes. “I’d never seen a film about a young British south Asian woman, let alone one who did sport. It meant so much to me in so many ways because it was representation I’ve never seen before or since. It’s more of a cultural moment than a film for me,” she said. Although considerable progress has been made in women’s sport since the film came out, Walker-Khan said stigma and stereotypes still hold back many south Asians, who are underrepresented in the Women’s Super League. There are misconceptions that traditional religious or family values stand in their way or that Asians “aren’t good at sport because they eat curry, they’re too weak or too small”, she said. Visibility has been a key driver of the sport’s rapid growth in popularity in recent years, said Stacey Pope, an associate professor of sport at Durham University. This started in 2011, with the creation of the professional Women’s Super League, and reached a turning point in 2015 when the Women’s World Cup garnered widespread, serious media coverage for the first time. This created role models and inspiration for women, and helped shed the sport’s image as a “bastion of masculinity”, which had been reinforced by a ban on women’s football that lasted until 1971, she added. Sophie Downey, who runs Girls On the Ball, which has promoted women’s football since 2012, said that, as well as the professionalisation of the game, the biggest changes in recent years have been at grassroots level. “It’s about young girls having the knowledge they can play for fun and join in, and that access just wasn’t there 20 years ago,” she said. “I think we’re at the tip of the iceberg, we’ve got the Euros this summer and that will be the biggest moment in history for the sport in this country. There’s a lot of room for it to grow but it’s looking really positive at the moment.”",Sport/Football, ‘A cultural moment’: what Bend It Like Beckham meant for UK women’s football,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/12/a-cultural-moment-what-bend-it-like-beckham-meant-for-uk-womens-football
4/12/2022,"This fascinating first anthology from new independent publisher Scratch Books features seven short stories alongside author interviews, with editor Tom Conaghan posing questions about openings and endings, inspirations and drafts. For Chris Power, the short story’s brevity means a reader is suspended in tension for the duration of the tale, the greatest endings, he suggests, exerting a kind of breathlessness – either from a “punch in the gut” twist or a release of pressure. This impressive collection, which also boasts stories by Jessie Greengrass, Sarah Hall, Jon McGregor, Irenosen Okojie, Joseph O’Neill and Mahreen Sohail, reads like a celebration of the craft of story-writing itself. The interviews are conversational rather than academic exchanges, and there is something special about being party to McGregor reappraising The First Punch with the benefit of nearly 20 years’ hindsight. These days, he thinks, he wouldn’t afford himself the luxury of any ambiguity in a short story. “It’s an excuse for vagueness,” he says, though the way the story works as a series of misjudged assumptions about the nature of relationships stills hits home. Similarly, reading Hall explaining the mechanics behind her BBC short story award-winning Mrs Fox is a treat. An unsettling account of a seemingly functional domestic relationship that turns on a character running into the woods and becoming vulpine in form, Hall explores how sensuality and poetry are more important than portraiture in short-form fiction. Get the first part right, she thinks, and readers will bring their own understanding of how people operate. These nuggets deepen the enjoyment of each story rather than diminishing their mystery. Inevitably, there’s some repetition, but the triumph of Reverse Engineering is that despite accepted norms of short story craft, every author offers something different. “The realm of the short story is a perennial Newfoundland,” as Conaghan neatly concludes.

4/12/2022,"The Conservative MP Crispin Blunt is under pressure to apologise for and retract comments that a fellow MP found guilty of sexual assault was a victim of a “miscarriage of justice”. Blunt deleted the tweet and removed the comment from his website after an intervention from Tory whips overnight. A Conservative source said: “Crispin’s views are wholly unacceptable. Following exchanges late last night we expect the statement to be retracted first thing this morning.” Blunt, the MP for Reigate since 1997 and chair of the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on LGBTQ+ rights, said he was certain the Wakefield MP, Imran Ahmad Khan, was innocent and that the trial “was nothing short of an international scandal”. Khan was found guilty of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy and has been expelled from the party. Labour called for the government to remove the whip from Blunt after the comments. James Heappey, the armed forces minister, told Sky News the comments were “not something the government associates itself with” and defended the jury who convicted Khan. He said: “Every one of us who believes in the judicial system and the rule of law has to respect that judgment.” Asked whether Blunt would have the whip removed, Heappey said that was “for people to look at today as they speak to Crispin, find out what this is all about”. He added: “Absolutely nobody in Her Majesty’s government is seeking to be critical of the decision of the court. If Mr Khan chooses to appeal, that is for him, but a court of law has found him guilty and that is what the government believes him to be therefore.” Blunt’s comments triggered the resignation of three MPs from the APPG that he chairs – the Scottish National party MPs Stewart McDonald and Joanna Cherry, and Labour’s Chris Bryant. Bryant told Sky News that Blunt should resign as chair of the APPG. “It is completely inappropriate for a member of parliament to start attacking the judicial process like this,’” he said. Blunt’s deleted statement said he had been prepared to testify in Khan’s defence. “I sat through some of the trial. The conduct of this case relied on lazy tropes about LGBT+ people that we might have thought we had put behind us decades ago,” he said. Reporters at the trial said Blunt attended the defence and summing up and did not see prosecution witnesses, including the boy’s parents, who reportedly broke down in tears giving evidence. If Khan is ousted, it will trigger what would be a closely fought byelection in his Wakefield seat, to which he was elected in 2019 as its first Tory MP since 1932.",News/Politics,Crispin Blunt urged to apologise for comments on Imran Ahmad Khan case,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/12/crispin-blunt-urged-to-apologise-for-comments-on-imran-ahmad-khan-case
4/12/2022,"Mask requirements for primary school-age students in Victoria are expected to be scrapped in term 2 if Covid cases continue to stabilise, as the state government reconsiders all the state’s restrictions. The state recorded 12 deaths and 10,293 new cases on Tuesday – a slight increase from Monday’s 9,597 infections – while there were 376 people in hospital with the virus, including 19 people in intensive care. In a statement announcing an easing of restrictions for cruise ship passengers and voters, the health minister, Martin Foley, said he would “reconsider all health orders” when the state reaches the Omicron BA.2 peak and case numbers begin to plateau later this month. If epidemiological conditions are as forecast, the government expects students in years 3 to 6 will no longer be required to wear masks in the classroom in term 2, which begins on 26 April. “We currently have the fewest restrictions in place since the beginning of the pandemic, and the sensible settings that are in place can be reviewed following the peak in cases,” Foley said. Since the beginning of term 1, 73,097 students and 8,275 staff across government schools have reported that they have tested positive for Covid-19. The attendance rate at government schools in Victoria has been about 89%, compared to 80% in New South Wales, where Omicron’s subvariant BA.2 surged through schools in February and March. Earlier on Tuesday, the state’s premier, Daniel Andrews, flagged the vaccinated economy, QR codes and isolation requirements for close contacts of Covid-19 cases could be scrapped once the latest outbreak peaks. “Once we get past the peak, once we start to see those numbers coming off, we will have options that are not available to us now,” he said. “To have less rules while case numbers are going up, that’s probably not a smart thing to do. But once they start to come off, which we think will be quite soon, we will have options available to us.” Under the new cruise ship protocols, which are consistent across Victoria, NSW and Queensland, all passengers aged 12 and older will need to have had two doses of a Covid vaccine to travel, while crew members will need to have had three. Passengers will need to test negative before embarking, while crew will be tested every 14 days or when symptomatic and are required to wear masks at all times, except when in their rooms. Passengers will also be required to wear masks when embarking and disembarking, or when they cannot socially distance indoors.

The changes come into effect at 11.59pm on Tuesday, ahead of Australia’s cruise ship ban ending later this month and the federal election on 21 May. The government will also clarify that close contact exemptions apply to air transport services workers associated with passenger travel, such as pilots, crew, airport security and baggage handlers, meaning workers who have no symptoms and return negative rapid antigen tests can attend work. Staff will need to take rapid tests for five days and must continue to follow isolation rules while not at work.

4/12/2022,"Russians have a word for the period between winter and spring when the snow melts and everything turns to mud. “Rasputitsa” is derived from rasputye, a crossroads, and has been translated as “when roads stop existing”. The Ukrainians call it “bezdorizhzhya” and this year it coincided with the Russian invasion. The muddy conditions, which make travel difficult or impossible on unpaved roads, are caused by heavy clay soil and poor drainage, and are a fact of life in Ukraine, Belarus and parts of Russia. A second muddy season arrives later with the heavy autumn rains. The mud season has had a significant effect on the Russian invasion, causing columns of trucks and armoured vehicles to stick to paved roads. Those that have ventured offroad frequently got stuck, in extreme cases tanks sinking up to their turrets in mud. These problems forced the Russian army to abandon many vehicles, later to be recovered by Ukrainian farmers with tractors. Ukraine now claims to have more tanks than it did before the invasion. The Russians know all about the mud season, which slowed down the German invasion during the second world war, and planned a lightning strike down main highways to Kyiv to avoid its effects. However, determined Ukrainian resistance forced the Russian assault offroad and into a quagmire.",News/News,Mud season in Ukraine leaves Russian tanks stuck in mire,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/apr/12/mud-season-in-ukraine-leaves-russian-tanks-stuck-in-mire
