3/20/2022,"Residents of Mariupol have been taken to Russia, where they have been “redirected” to remote cities in the country, the Mariupol city council has reported. The council said that “several thousand Mariupol residents were deported to Russia”, having been taken to “filtration camps, where occupiers checked people’s phones and documents”. Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged Switzerland to crack down on Russian oligarchs who he said are helping to wage war on Ukraine from the safety of “beautiful Swiss towns”. “Your banks are where the money of the people who unleashed this war lies. That is painful, he said, addressing an anti-war protest in Bern. Poland has proposed for the European Union to implement a total ban on trade with Russia, prime minister Mateus Morawiecki has said. “Poland is proposing to add a trade blockade to this package of sanctions as soon as possible, (including) both of its seaports... but also a ban on land trade. The southern city of Zaporizhzhia entered a 38-hour curfew beginning at 4pm local time on Saturday after the Ukrainian military ordered people to stay home until early on Monday. The city has become an important route for some of the 35,000 people estimated to have escaped the siege of Mariupol. Aid agencies are being prevented from reaching people trapped in Ukrainian cities surrounded by Russian forces, the World Food Programme said. It has warned that Ukraine’s food supply chains are breaking down, with many grocery stores and warehouses now empty. Russia said it had used hypersonic weapons, which travel fast enough to evade detection by missile defence systems, to destroy an underground military depot in western Ukraine. Its defence ministry said on Saturday it hit the depot for missiles and aircraft ammunition in the Ivano-Fehrankivsk region, the Interfax news agency reported. The ministry said it had also destroyed Ukrainian military radio and reconnaissance centres near the port city of Odesa using a coastal missile system, according to Interfax. Ten humanitarian corridors were agreed with Russia for the evacuation of citizens, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk has said. Reuters reports that Vereshchuk said a corridor had been agreed for the besieged city of Mariupol, although the authorities’ previous efforts to evacuate civilians there under a temporary ceasefire have mostly failed Kyiv officials have reported that 228 people, including four children, have been killed in the capital. Ukraine’s ministry of foreign affairs reported that 14,400 Russian personnel have been killed since the start of the war. Boris Johnson has come under heavy criticism for comparing the struggle of Ukrainians fighting to the British public voting for Brexit. In his speech to the Conservative spring conference in Blackpool, Johnson said it is the “instinct of the people of this country, like the people of Ukraine, to choose freedom”, with the Brexit vote a “famous recent example”. The comparison was condemned by Tory peer Lord Barwell, who pointed out Ukraine is seeking to join the EU. Zelenskiy called for “meaningful, fair” peace talks to take place urgently. Ukraine’s president told Moscow that Russian losses would otherwise be so huge it would take generations to recover. “Negotiations on peace, on security for us, for Ukraine – meaningful, fair and without delay – are the only chance for Russia to reduce the damage from its own mistakes,” he said. Ukraine may not produce enough crops to export if this year’s sowing season is disrupted by Russia’s invasion, the presidential adviser Oleh Ustenko has said. “Ukraine has enough grain and food reserves to survive for a year, but if the war continues ... [Ukraine] will not be able to export grain to the world, and there will be problems,” he said, adding that Ukraine is the world’s fifth-largest wheat exporter.",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 25 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-25-of-the-invasion
