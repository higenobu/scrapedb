2/25/2022,"Storms, like sorrows, come not single spies these days, but in battalions. Or at least, that was my impression from listening to the news. So between the exit of Dudley and the entrance of Eunice I hurried out to check on some vulnerable old trees. Cycling towards Chatsworth, I noticed a few middle-aged oaks in the adjacent fields. The clean trunk of one mighty specimen would, quarter-sawn, make a floor in the duke’s house. Two narrower stems were 10 metres apart, but their vast crowns met in the air, each matched against the other in form and volume so that the dome of bare branches seemed to spring from a single source.  Yet, while these oaks were grand, those I really wanted to see were much older, a last fragment of a medieval forest that once surrounded the house. And since this corner of Chatsworth is off limits to casual visitors, I leaned my bike against the estate wall where I could look over at these fading giants. Ancient oaks defy our expectations. Like people in extreme old age, they become wholly idiosyncratic, with deficiencies and disfigurements that make each a character unlike any of its neighbours. And much more than people, each tree is its own ecosystem, with its own assemblage of lichens and fungi, each supporting scores of different species of moths and other invertebrates, gathering genetic mutations as it ages, a sort of wisdom that preserves each tree from the pests and pathogens that have threatened it through the centuries. They really do contain multitudes. One oak in particular caught my eye, its trunk immensely fat but crowned with just a few sparse branches; all it could hold with life ebbing from it, like a slow tide. I spotted a large hole and realised I could see right through its bulk to the hillside beyond. The Dutch botanist Aljos Farjon measured the girth of these trees and found one at over seven metres, meaning they are likely to have germinated in the 15th century. Sobering to think they were already mature when Mary, Queen of Scots saw them during her detention here, a thousand thousand storms ago.

2/25/2022,"Like most things in Mahatma Gandhi’s life, his ashram in the Indian city of Ahmedabad was simple and austere. Yet between 1917 and 1930, these modest white bungalows, set on the bank of the Sabarmati river in the state of Gujarat, were the beating heart of Gandhi’s non-violent freedom struggle against British rule and his experiments in upending India’s oppressive caste system. Gandhi – who would eventually lead India to independence and remains a global icon for peace – left the Sabarmati ashram in 1930, never to return, and in the years since, it has become one of India’s most sacrosanct sites. It is where Nelson Mandela, Bill Clinton, Xi Jinping, Benjamin Netanyahu and most recently Donald Trump all paid a visit to during their trips to India.  But recently, it has been at the centre of an outcry over a grandiose plan by the government to redevelop the site into a “world class tourist destination” at a staggering cost of 12bn rupees (£117m). Descendants of Gandhi, historians, scholars, Gandhian institutions and lifelong ashram residents have accused the government, led by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, of attempting to co-opt and politicise Gandhi’s legacy to suit their own Hindu nationalist agenda and turning the Sabarmati ashram into a flashy Gandhi “theme park”. “This is the first time any government has actively interfered and imposed their own vision on a Gandhi monument,” said Gandhi’s great-grandson Tushar Gandhi. “This is part of a sinister design by Modi to obliterate Gandhi’s legacy and rewrite the history of India where he and his politics have no place.” Tushar Gandhi has filed an appeal in India’s highest court to halt the development. “If bapu [spiritual father] were alive today, he would never agree to this,” he said. Situated in what is now the centre of Ahmedabad, a city of eight million people, over the decades the ashram has fallen victim to the pressures of urbanisation. Its once sprawling 48-hectare (120 acre) grounds have been eroded to around two hectares and busy four-lane road was built through it. The surrounding area became filled with ramshackle housing, concrete hotels, roadside restaurants and garish shops selling cheap tourist wares. Squatters moved into the residential areas and businesses incompatible with Gandhi’s teaching – a cow artificial insemination centre being one – were set up in the ashram grounds. Discussions on how to restore the Sabarmati ashram grounds have raged for years but with the site being controlled by six different trusts with differing interests and agendas, nothing ever moved. That was until, the Indian government stepped in and took over. Under their new development plan – which unusually is being run directly from the prime minister’s office – the ashram site will be expanded to 20 hectares, given a sleek makeover with new Gandhi museums and monuments erected and other structures knocked down. Yet the government has faced considerable criticism over a lack of transparency for the redevelopment, including the unilateral appointment of Modi’s favoured architect for all his flagship projects, and lack of consultation with Gandhi scholars and institutions. Most worrying for some is the complicated relationship that Modi and the ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) have with Gandhi. During his life, Gandhi was vehemently opposed to the Hindutva [Hindu nationalist] politics now espoused by Modi and the BJP, which believes that India should be a Hindu rather than secular state. Nathuram Godse, who assassinated Gandhi, had been a member of the RSS, the right-wing paramilitary organisation that gave rise to the BJP and to which Modi and many BJP politicians also belonged to. Within RSS circles there is still great disdain for Gandhi and under Modi’s premiership, reverence of Godse, Gandhi’s killer, has now become mainstream in India. Ramachandra Guha, one of India’s most eminent historians and biographer of Gandhi, was fiercely opposed to the ashram development. “Everything that the BJP stands for is antithetical to what Gandhi stood for,” said Guha. “This is a cynical project to whitewash Modi’s dark record.” Ashoke Chatterjee, a trustee for the Sabarmati Ashram Preservation and Memorial Trust – one of the six trusts that look after the ashram, made assurances that the redevelopment plans were still in their very early stages and that, through a “relatively collaborative” process, they government had agreed that the original ashram ethos and heritage buildings would remain preserved. Speaking in a personal capacity, Chatterjee said the trustees had already batted away what he termed “some incredibly stupid ideas”. One proposal was that there should be a hologram of Gandhi that would rise out of fountains on the Sarbarmati river at night, and another that they would build a huge steel spinning wheel in the ashram that would be so big it could be seen from aeroplanes flying over the city – “one ridiculous notion after another”. Nonetheless, Chatterjee said the trustees were well aware there maybe be “hidden agendas” behind the ashram development. He cited the government’s recent decision to remove Abide By Me, Gandhi’s favourite hymn, from the celebrations of India’s Republic Day – thereby erasing the only association with Gandhi left in the ceremony – as “a warning of what the ashram is up against”. “We have seen all these efforts to take ownership of the Mahatma and convert him into something else that they can manipulate,” he said. “We know that we have to be vigilant.” IK Patel, a state government official, denied any politicisation of the ashram. “There is no political agenda from the government,” said Patel. “We are restoring the ashram so the next generation can properly experience the history and values of Gandhi ji. This will honour Gandhi ji’s legacy.” The redevelopment has also faced criticism over the decision to evict the 400 or so families living in the ashram grounds, some whom are descendants of the Dalit families brought there by Gandhi himself. Gandhi left explicit instructions that these families should be allowed to stay in perpetuity and that the ashram should for ever work for the uplift of Dalits, the lowest in India’s caste system who were referred to as “untouchables” in Gandhi’s time. For almost two years, the residents protested against their eviction but now over half have accepted what the government described as a “generous” package: either 6 million rupees compensation, or a new four-bedroom high-rise apartment. Yet behind closed doors, several residents spoke quietly of being intimidated and pressured to accept compensation and leave against their will by a small resident’s committee that has ties with the state government. One lifelong resident said she was “habituated to live a simple life, like Gandhi ji. I do not know how to live in a high-rise flat away from the ashram and the trees and the river. It makes me very sad to be forced to leave my birthplace.” “I have lived here since I was 10 years old, I don’t want to leave my home and everything I have built here but I am being forced,” added Jadi Dhabi, 85, another resident. “Everybody is afraid of Modi so we have no choice.”",News/World news,‘A flashy theme park’: outcry over Modi’s plans for the Gandhi ashram,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/a-flashy-theme-park-outcry-over-modis-plans-for-the-gandhi-ashram

There are several Ukrainian charities working on the ground. Caritas Australia has been working with Caritas Ukraine since 2014 to help people affected by the humanitarian crisis, and is providing essential emergency goods including shelter, food relief and cash distributions. The Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations – the national peak body for 24 Ukrainian Australian community organisations – is encouraging concerned Australians to donate to the Ukraine Crisis Appeal which has pivoted to supplying urgent supplies to displaced and injured Ukrainians. United Help Ukraine focuses on providing medical supplies and humanitarian aid, and raising awareness of the conflict. Voices of Children aims to help children affected by the war in eastern Ukraine, providing support through art therapy, psychologists, video storytelling and a number of other methods. The Ukrainian Red Cross is also taking donations from abroad to mobilise volunteers and provide resources and support to victims on the ground. English-language news outlets based in the country, such as the the Kyiv Independent and the New Voice of Ukraine, are covering developments on the ground as the conflict unfolds, using local journalists.

2/25/2022,"The US decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal was an immense personal achievement for former Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In a leaked video, he boasted that he had personally convinced Donald Trump to scrap the 2015 accord between Tehran and world powers. “I had to stand up against the whole world and come out against this agreement,” Netanyahu told members of his Likud party in the clip from 2018. “And we didn’t give up.”  But four years on, the Israeli leader has been booted out of office – as has Trump. Both Congress and the Knesset contain more leftwing voices, while in Iran, moderate Hassan Rouhani lost last year’s presidential election to hardliner Ebrahim Raisi. International negotiators in Vienna are edging closer to what amounts to a watered-down version of the original deal. In the process, what a short time ago was believed by many Israelis to be Netanyahu’s major geopolitical victory has instead become a growing source of concern for Israel’s political and security establishment. “The US has tried maximum pressure with sanctions, Israel has assassinated nuclear scientists and carried out attacks designed to limit Iranian military activity around the region. But none of it has worked,” said Danny Citrinowicz, who led Israel’s military intelligence research between 2013 and 2016. “All it’s done is push Iran forward with its nuclear programme. Now we are out of options, and I worry that Israel and Iran are on a collision course in the near future.” The 2015 agreement spearheaded by Barack Obama lifted crippling international sanctions on the Islamic Republic’s economy in exchange for 10-15 years of curbs on its nuclear activities. Since it unravelled in 2018, Iran has raced ahead with uranium enrichment. Although the Iranian government maintains that its nuclear programme is peaceful, experts generally agree that should it choose to, Tehran could possess functional nuclear weapons within two years. The restored deal is set to maintain the original’s timeframes, meaning limits on uranium enrichment will still expire in 2025. For Israel, the outcome is much worse than the maligned 2015 accord. Tehran has not just made significant technological progress, which will only be monitored for the next three years, it is also about to receive $7bn in released frozen assets, as well as sanctions relief on exports such as oil. This money, Israel believes, will be funnelled to Iran’s proxies across the region, and the international legitimacy conferred by the nuclear accord could encourage the Islamic Republic to be bolder in its regional ambitions. Israel is already engaged in longstanding land and air campaigns on its borders against Lebanon’s Hezbollah, Iranian-funded groups in Syria and Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip, as well as maritime skirmishes targeting Iranian and Israeli cargo ships in the Red and Mediterranean seas. Iran also holds sway over Shia militias in Iraq, and sees Yemen’s Houthi rebels as partners of growing regional importance. In January the Houthis proved their drones and missiles were capable of reaching Abu Dhabi – which means Tel Aviv could soon be a target within their reach. “Iran is entrenched in many theatres in the region now, and it’s not only military – we are talking about economic and cultural ties too. Combined with the proliferation of UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones] and UASs [unmanned aerial systems], this is hybrid warfare,” said an IDF official who asked not to be named. “If they want to hurt Israelis, they already have numerous axes to attempt it.” Compared with the Netanyahu era, this time around Israeli officials have been watching quietly on the sidelines as the nuclear negotiations unfold. Aware there is little it can do to influence the outcome, the Israeli government instead appears to be pushing its US allies for a bilateral day-after agreement to address Israeli worries. This week, President Naftali Bennett reiterated Israel’s longstanding position that the country “will always maintain its freedom of action to defend itself”. In November the Knesset passed a budget featuring a 7bn shekel (£1.6bn) increase in spending for the defence establishment to prepare for the threat posed by Iran. Israel is also poised to deepen security ties with its new Abraham Accords partners in the Gulf, who also fear Iranian military capability: this month, a security pact was signed with Bahrain. And while bringing the nuclear deal with Iran back to life may represent a limited success for the Biden administration, the stakes in the Middle East are still rising. “These issues don’t exist in isolation any more. For example, during Operation Guardian of the Walls [the May 2021 war between Hamas and Israel], we saw that you can’t just attack Hamas. Hezbollah got involved too, and we had rocket fire from Lebanon,” said Citrinowicz. “We are active in the shadow war, but we must preserve the rules of the game. If we do something dramatic in Iran, like striking nuclear facilities, it will trigger a severe escalation on many fronts.”",News/World news,Why Israel faces new dangers in shadow war against Iran if nuclear deal is agreed,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/why-israel-faces-new-dangers-in-shadow-war-against-iran-if-nuclear-deal-is-agreed
2/25/2022,"A British man and his Ukrainian wife spent 12 hours shuttling between cities targeted by Russian bombs on Thursday in a desperate but failed bid to complete her biometric registration for a UK spousal visa. Fozan and Iryna Dar left the central city of Dnipro, where they live, on a midnight train on Wednesday, in a last-ditch attempt to reach the processing centre in Kyiv. Soon after, the city’s airport closed and bombing began, there and in other cities.  Their train shuddered to a halt in a distant suburb of the Ukrainian capital as the city was hit by Russian airstrikes. Eventually, the couple decided to get off the train there, pay more for a taxi than they had for the train tickets, and head to the biometric registration centre. When they got there, a handwritten sign on the door said: “Today we aren’t working, sorry for the inconvenience.” They called the embassy, who first said the centre was open, then said there was nothing they could do, as the collection of biometric data had been contracted out. Iryna had originally applied for a UK visitor’s visa two days before the British embassy advised citizens to leave Ukraine, hoping to meet her husband’s extended family after Covid restrictions forced them to have a small wedding. Because the embassy held her passport, the couple could not leave. Fozan studies medicine at a university that has already evacuated many of its international students, but he refused to go without his wife. “There is no way in hell I’m leaving her behind, it’s not up for debate. I have to protect her,” he said. As the situation in Ukraine got more serious, the couple decided to switch their application and ask for a spousal visa. Visitor visas cannot be used for more than six months. As warnings of invasion came, they feared it might not be possible to return to Dnipro for longer than that, and Iryna didn’t want to be in the UK on a restricted visa for an unknown period of time. But the embassy kept her passport and told her that the biometric details collected for her visitor visa could not be used for her latest application, she said. After 10 days of increasingly desperate calls to a consular helpline, her passport was returned on Tuesday and they told to redo her biometric registration in Kyiv. So they bought train tickets that would get them to the Ukrainian capital the first possible day: Thursday morning. “We were woken up on the train at 5am by friends calling, who said they were in hiding in the basement, and the shelling went on for over an hour,” Fozan said. Despite those attacks, and fear of more violence, the couple have decided to return to Dnipro again, because it’s their home, they have family there, and they hope the university where Fozan studies might include them in any further evacuation. As they waited for their train, the couple spent several hours as a kind of unofficial advice bureau to other foreigners milling around the station in desperation after tickets sold out. “People noticed we were speaking English to each other, and I looked Ukrainian, so they asked us for help with things like reading the timetable,” she said. The people they helped included Germans and Pakistanis and a man from Manchester who got trapped when his overnight layover coincided with Russia’s invasion, and his flight out of Kyiv was cancelled.",News/World news,Ukraine: bombs and bureaucracy thwart couple’s quest for UK spousal visa,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/ukraine-bombs-and-bureaucracy-thwart-couples-quest-for-uk-spousal-visa
2/25/2022,"Wafaa Al-Najili’s voice, fiery and bright, enchants the group of young people clustered around an audio workstation at the Delia arts centre in Gaza City. Together, they muse over how to mix her vocals with the other tracks of their latest project, a new recording of a traditional choral song. Outside, the neighbourhood still bears scars from last year’s fighting between Israel and Hamas, the Palestinian militant group in control of the Gaza Strip. The joint Israeli and Egyptian blockade that isolates Gaza from the rest of the world means rebuilding efforts have been slow.  But, in the darkness of the recording studio, these young musicians could be anywhere in the world. “There are not many outlets for fun and self-expression in Gaza,” said Ayman Mghamis, the centre’s project manager, himself a rapper with a budding international career, which was cut short after Hamas took over the area in 2007. “We don’t just want to give young people that, we want to build up the music sector here into something that people make careers out of.” Palestinian musical traditions have been under threat since the Israeli occupation, but arts and cultural endeavours in Gaza have also suffered greatly under the rule of the strictly conservative Hamas. Concerts have been banned for the last 15 years. Even Mohammed Assaf, the wildly popular winner of Arab Idol from a Gazan refugee camp, has not been able to perform in public. The blockade has also led to a shortage of instruments and other equipment, making music an unaffordable pastime for most ordinary people. Music programmes, which started at Gaza University in 2015, shut down shortly afterwards. At the moment, there is just one instrument shop to serve the strip’s entire two-million-strong population, and few rehearsal and recording spaces. While the impact of these obstacles is hard to measure, in 2015 the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics found that only 39% of Gazans listen to music as a hobby, compared with 71% of Palestinians in the West Bank. The Delia arts centre aims to solve some of these problems. Plans for a Gaza branch of the Athens-based Delia Arts Foundation began in 2018, after founder John Keating, a music producer and founder of RNT Records, paid a visit to the strip. Despite a slow start owing to the hurdles imposed by the blockade, and further delays caused by the pandemic, the centre now offers four programmes a week. Three in-person and one online class allow Gazans to learn music theory and sound producing and engineering, and some classes are only for women and girls to encourage more to take part. The centre is now frequented by around 80 people a week, mostly in their late teens and early 20s. “Particularly since the last round of fighting [in May 2021], I have seen changes in the young people I work with,” Mghamis said. “Obviously we were all affected. But I also see how the centre helps them discover happiness and creativity again.” For Najili, the centre is a lifeline: a place where she can experiment with her favourite pieces and original songs, as well as impart her passion to a new generation of Gazan girls eager to explore the world of music. The 30-year-old from Khan Yunis in the south of the Gaza Strip grew up in a family that loved music. She and her siblings learned from their father, who sang and played the oud at weddings. Despite her talent, however, there was no opportunity for Najili to pursue music in the blockaded Gaza, so she trained as a nurse. “Working in nursing was the only way for me to earn money in the difficult economic conditions we are living in,” she said. “I kept singing over the years, but it has caused problems. As a girl who sings and has relatively liberal tendencies in a conservative society, many relatives and neighbours complained to my parents about me, which led my father to ask me to stop. I left Khan Yunis and lived with my aunt in Gaza City for several years.” At the Delia arts centre, Najli has been able to take part in professional recording sessions and put out her work to audiences on Instagram, TikTok and YouTube, including an Arabic cover of Blackbird by the Beatles. In the accompanying music video, Najili glides through choppy Mediterranean waters off the Gazan coast on a paddleboard, her glorious white dress rippling like a sail in the sunset. “I was very frustrated [before I started at the Delia centre], and in some periods in the past, I had begun to lose hope. After training as a voice teacher there, I got back my desire for singing. In a small way, I am helping other girls, and I must continue too,” she said. “I have still never stood on a big stage to sing in front of an audience, because there are no public concerts in Gaza. But it remains my biggest dream.”",News/World news,‘There are not many outlets for fun’: the Gazan arts centre that keeps music alive,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/there-are-not-many-outlets-for-fun-the-gazan-arts-centre-that-keeps-music-alive
2/25/2022,"This close to an Australian election, I’m as surprised as anyone to learn the government is staking out campaign space on the issue of equality in women’s sport. This isn’t because Australians don’t like sport – we do! Or because there are no women here – there are plenty! Just look at all the ones who marched around the country last year!  The political demands of those marches were for properly resourced anti-violence services, safe workplaces, pay parity, action on underrepresentation of women in decision-making, improved care infrastructure, job security in heavily feminised industries … and a little respect. They have not gone away. Yet Morrison and the Liberal-National Coalition have made meaningful commitments to none of them. This contextualises the rather conspicuous slide of the prime minister’s electoral approval with this not-inconsiderably-sized voting bloc. Pollsters have been warning the Liberals about their dire women problem for a year. So one can see the pressing need of the Liberal-National Coalition to improve their standing with women voters without having to admit to their old rhetoric or to own their past mistakes. Alas, one can now all too easily imagine the panicked campaign brainstorm meeting: “Maybe … sport? Do chicks like sport? Is chicks liking sport a thing?” Now, we are here. Australian sport is certainly a realm with massive and obvious gender inequalities. Government has a crucial role to play in addressing them. There’s the issue that government money flows into professional sporting associations in which the leadership and decision-making structures heave with overrepresentation from men. There’s the ongoing issue of a huge gender pay disparity that denudes women’s opportunities for professional development by obliging their work as part-time. Women’s sport doesn’t get equal media interest as men’s, nor comparable sponsorship opportunities. There have been failures of oversight that facilitated women’s harassment and even, allegedly, sexual abuse. Problem is, the current policy intervention into women’s sport that Scott Morrison claims is “terrific” isn’t about ANY of these things. It’s not even a meaningful apology for how the pretext of funding women’s sporting facilities was exposed as another form of government pork-barrelling in the “sports rorts” affair. The rugby league club that got $500,000 for a unisex change-room upgrade despite not having an above-12 female team sticks in the mind. No, the campaign conversation the Liberals want to have is a private member’s bill proposal from Tasmanian senator Claire Chandler that would empower sporting clubs to kick transgender girls and women out of women’s competition. What the prime minister claims is “terrific” is a policy informed not by science, medicine or the professional standards that already govern everyone’s competitive sporting participation, but on the stale political practice of using myths of danger and threat to create divisive demons within an already marginalised community. The Liberals are using this bill to front active discrimination and pretend it’s got something to do with women’s equality. Even the senator was unable to name a single sporting club in her home state that had actually asked for the ban. With access to the full resources of government, she’d know that the government authority Sport Australia has identified that the tiny percentage of transgender Australians are seriously underrepresented in Australian sport already, at all levels. She’d know, too, that the sporting regulations and codes that administer everything from weight classes for competition to whether someone has recently taken an aspirin exist precisely to ensure sporting opportunities are fair for everyone. The dissembling, of course, occurs in the wake of the Liberals’ failed “religious discrimination bill” to legalise spurious discrimination against transgender Australians as demanded by a hard-right religious lobby. As Labor, various cross-benchers and rebels from the Liberals’ own ranks successfully scuppered that legislation, the likelihood of success for the new bill is zero. The point, of course, is not to win the bill but to satisfy the ideological purity tests of an apparently transphobic hard right disappointed with the last bill’s failure, at the same time feeling out a potential fracture point within the powerful alliance of women arraigned politically against them. It’s not about sport, and it is the opposite of anything to do with equality. It’s about an ancient electoral ploy to attach fear and suspicion on to an already marginalised community that a significant number of Australians don’t know much about, in a place they’re unlikely to encounter them, just to whip up fear and division. That’s not sport. It’s not even politics. It’s just cruelty.",Opinion/Opinion, The Coalition’s push for a single-sex sport law isn’t about sport or even politics – only cruelty | Van Badham,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/25/the-coalitions-push-for-single-sex-sport-law-isnt-about-sport-or-even-politics-only-cruelty
2/25/2022,"A local council has reversed its position on the sign stoush in the Goldstein electorate, now ruling in favour of Liberal Tim Wilson, who complained that independent Zoe Daniel’s signs had been erected prematurely. The Bayside city council now claims that because the House of Representatives election is not technically due until 3 September, signs put up before 3 June are unlawful – until the election is called.  A spokeswoman for Daniel said “given the council has backflipped on its original advice to us, which it reiterated publicly two days ago, we are taking further legal advice”. Wilson had written to his constituents accusing Daniel’s campaign of “ignoring the council” by allegedly unlawfully erecting signs before the election had been called, and urging them to dob in her supporters. On Wednesday the council ruled that – since the election will be held by 21 May – signs erected after 21 February “are within the [three-month] period in which an election must be held” and are lawful, even without a permit. That ruling has now been changed, after Wilson complained that, although 21 May is the deadline for a combined lower house and Senate election, the last date for the House of Representatives election is technically 3 September. A lower house election that late would only be possible if the government chooses to split the two votes by having a half Senate election first, almost unheard of this late in the political cycle. On 21 February, Scott Morrison said the “election has to be held by about the middle of May”. “That’s what the constitutional requirements are and, you know, the election will be held this year,” he told Tasmania Talks radio. But the council has now said it has “received advice from the Australian Electoral Commission regarding the timing of the forthcoming federal election”. “The AEC has advised that there is a possibility of separate elections for the two houses of the Australian parliament, with the latest possible date for a Senate election being 21 May 2022 and the latest possible date for a House of Representatives election being 3 September 2022,” it said. Consistent with earlier advice, @BaysideCouncil confirms election signs on homes need planning permits until poll is called, or 03/06 (<3 months 03/09). We’ve always obeyed this law. All candidates should show integrity & do the same. https://t.co/ksLeW6G1Zd The council noted bylaws allowed signs to be displayed for 14 days after an event or three months in total. “Based on [the] above, any sign associated with a House of Representative candidate would be unlawfully erected if: no election has been called; or the sign is erected prior to 3 June 2022.” The council said it had advised all known federal election candidates in the seat of Goldstein. Guardian Australia understands the Daniel campaign engaged a QC to provide legal advice on the sign stoush, including whether requiring a permit infringes the implied freedom of political communication.

Although Wilson holds the blue-ribbon seat of Goldstein on an 8% margin it is threatened by the independent challenge. After encouraging constituents to dob in allegedly unlawful signs, Wilson said: “I feel sorry for those households about to be fined nearly $1,000 each … because their candidate is knowingly encouraging them to break the law.” Community group Voices for Goldstein, which has endorsed Daniel, claims the sign stoush is playing well for the independent, resulting in a bumper crop of donations: Tim Wilson continues to do our work for usYesterday we had a 6 fold increase on our average daily donationsYou can still get in on the actionhttps://t.co/UxuwiUA0fZ On Thursday, Daniel shared news of the council’s deliberations on the sign stoush, thanking the “flood of new people who have engaged with our campaign this week”.
