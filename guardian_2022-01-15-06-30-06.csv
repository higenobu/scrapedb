1/15/2022,"Martin Shkreli, the pharmaceutical entrepreneur vilified for astronomically hiking the price of a life-saving drug, has been barred for life from the pharmaceutical industry and fined $64.6m by a US court.  The Friday ruling came after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and seven states brought a case against Shkreli, nicknamed the “Pharma Bro” for his sometimes outrageous behavior. Shkreli was chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals, a company that in 2015 hiked the price of Daraprim, a drug used to treat Aids, malaria and cancer, by more than 5,000%. The ensuing scandal managed to unite Donald Trump and his then presidential rival, Hillary Clinton, in condemnation. Trump called Shkreli a “spoiled brat” and Clinton slammed his price gouging. “Banning an individual from an entire industry and limiting his future capacity to make a living in that field is a serious remedy and must be done with care and only if equity demands,” US district judge Denise Cote wrote in a 135-page ruling on Friday. “Shkreli’s egregious, deliberate, repetitive, long-running, and ultimately dangerous illegal conduct warrants imposition of an injunction of this scope. “From day one, Shkreli focused his new venture on acquiring sole-source drugs that were the gold standard treatment option for life-threatening diseases with a small patient population and inferior alternative treatments, with the intent to raise their prices, block generic competition, and reap extraordinary profits.” In 2018 in an unrelated case, Shkreli was jailed for seven years for securities fraud. During the trial, Shkreli lost bail after encouraging fans to obtain a hair off Clinton’s head: “$5,000 but the hair has to include a follicle. Do not assault anyone for any reason ever (LOLIBERALS),” he wrote in a now deleted Facebook post. Even in jail, Shkreli continued to push up the price of Daraprim, according to reports by the Wall Street Journal cited in court records. The New York state attorney general, Letitia James, brought the case against Shkreli in January 2020, accusing him of using monopoly control to keep the drug price high. She was joined by the FTC and other attorneys general. “Martin Shkreli is a ‘Pharma Bro’ no more,” James wrote on Twitter on Friday. “The powerful don’t get to make their own rules, despite Shkreli thinking cash rules everything around him.”",News/US news,Martin Shkreli barred from drug industry and fined $64.6m by US court,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/14/martin-shkreli-barred-drug-industry-fined-us-court
1/15/2022,"A six-year-old girl thought to have died from sepsis was in fact suffering from a blood condition triggered by E coli infection, an inquest has found. Coco Rose Bradford was taken to the Royal Cornwall hospital in the summer of 2017 suffering from stomach problems and later transferred to the Bristol Royal hospital for children, where she died.  The following year an independent review flagged up failings in her care in Cornwall and the Royal Cornwall hospitals trust apologised for how it had treated her. Her family were left with the belief she had died of sepsis and could have been saved if she had been given antibiotics. But on Friday, coroner Andrew Cox, sitting in Truro, found that Coco died from multiple organ failure caused by haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS). The inquest heard there is no proven treatment for HUS. Cox said Coco’s family had been misled over the sepsis diagnosis, which he said was deeply regrettable, adding: “As a matter of fact, I find Coco had overwhelming HUS, not overwhelming sepsis.” During the inquest, the court heard Coco’s family felt staff at the Cornish hospital were “dismissive, rude and arrogant” and did not take her condition seriously. Cox found that although staff had recognised the risk of HUS from the moment Coco was admitted, this was not clearly set out in a robust management plan. The coroner also said a lack of communication had made Coco “something of a hostage to fortune”. He found Coco died from natural causes, specifically HUS arising as a complication from E coli infection. After the hearing Coco’s family said: “Four and a half years after Coco died, three years after the trust fully accepted a series of failings in their care, we heard for the first time in court the suggestion that Coco did not have sepsis.” They said they felt they had been misled for years, adding: “Coco should now be at secondary school, she should be brightening our lives with her gorgeous smile and living her best life. We will never come to terms with life without Coco in it.” Royal Cornwall hospitals NHS trust said it profoundly regretted failings in Coco’s care. Medical director Dr Allister Grant said: “While the coroner has concluded, based on the expert evidence, that different treatment would not have avoided Coco’s tragic death, this does not take away from the fact that we let Coco and her family down. “We also regret Coco’s family has been caused additional distress by the belief that Coco’s poorly condition was explained by sepsis, as opposed to an overwhelming inflammatory condition called HUS.”",News/Society,"Family of Cornwall girl, 6, misled over cause of death, coroner finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/14/family-of-cornwall-girl-6-misled-over-cause-of-death-coroner-finds
