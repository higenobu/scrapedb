2/18/2022,"Canada’s main terrorism watch agency has warned since late January that it is “likely” that violent extremist groups insinuated themselves in the protest convoy that has paralysed the country’s capital for weeks and prompted a string of copy-cat protests. Intelligence assessments – prepared by Canada’s Integrated Terroism Assessment Centre (ITAC) and seen by the Guardian – warn that the scale of the protests could yet pose a “trigger point and opportunity for potential lone actor attackers to conduct a terrorism attack”.  The assessments offer the first real glimpse in how federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies have assessed the threat of Canada’s anti-vaccine and conspiracy movement. They also show that clear warnings were sent to Ottawa police ahead of the convoy’s arrival in the capital. The city’s police has become the focus of a fierce debate over whether they should have done more to prepare for, or prevent, the occupation. ITAC reported that supporters of the convoy have “advocated civil war”, called for violence against prime minister Justin Trudeau, and said the protest should be “used as Canada’s ‘January 6’”, in a reference to the storming of the US Capitol. An early report, dated 27 January, ITAC concluded that “a coordinated, complex terrorist attack or planned storming Parliament or other federal locations is unlikely”. But it concludes that the potential for violence remained very real. “While the organizers have declared that this is an act of peaceful protest, some ideologically motivated violent extremism followers in Canada have seized upon this rally to advocate for their own ideological objectives,” the January document reads. “Extremists and other individuals supporting Covid-19 conspiracy theories and violent anti-authority/anti-government views have expressed intent to participate in the convoy and to attend the accompanying protest in Ottawa.” The assessment warns that protesters, and possible extremists, “could use rudimentary capabilities, such as trucks, cargo and fuel, to cause disruptions to infrastructure”. Presciently, the report warned that the 31 January return of Parliament “could motivate a dedicated group of protesters to prolong their protest in Ottawa”. Included in the report is a meme, which was shared widely in the early days of the convoy, which shows a map with a circle surrounding Ottawa and reads “permanent gridlock zone until freedom restored”. As the occupation dragged into its second week, ITAC issued another report on 8 February. “All events remained relatively peaceful, with limited low-level conflict,” it reads. “However, violent online rhetoric and the physical presence of ideological extremists at some gatherings remain a factor of concern.” The report makes particular mention of QAnon figure Romana Didulo, the self-styled “Queen of Canada”, who has instructed her followers to kill healthcare workers and politicians. She and some of her followers appeared in Ottawa for the occupation, waving flags representing her supposed kingdom. ITAC also drew attention to a constellation of other demonstrations across the country, including in Quebec City where “the QAnon flag was observed, and the extremist group La Meute stated that approximately 100 members participated in the protest.” La Meute, or The Pack is one of the most visible and influential far-right, anti-Islam organizations in Quebec. It also claimed to have sent supporters to the Ottawa protests, the report said. In the second report, ITAC continued to assess the likelihood of a January 6-style insurrection as unlikely, but began warning that “the most likely ideologically motivated violent extremism-related scenario involves an individual or small group using readily available weapons and resources such as knives, firearms, homemade explosives and vehicles in public areas against soft targets, including opposition groups or members of the general public.” Earlier this week at a blockade at the Coutts border crossing in Alberta, police arrested four men and charged them with conspiring to kill police officers and civilians. On Wednesday, Public Safety Minister Marco Medicino confirmed that some of those arrested had ties to some extremist elements in Ottawa. Some of the men arrested are believed to belong to a loose knit group known as Diagolon. ITAC reports are largely based on open source intelligence, meaning information already available in the public domain, and law enforcement sources – the centre does not actively monitor individuals or conduct its own investigations. The purpose of ITAC is to provide various levels of local law enforcement with reliable information on emerging threats, said Stephanie Carvin, a former intelligence analyst with the Canadian Security Intelligence Service who now teaches at the Norman Paterson School of International Affairs at Carleton University in Ottawa. “They seem to recognize the nature of the event, and who’s coming to the event,” she said. But, the analysts appear to have missed some of the extreme elements of the leadership of the convoy, Carvin said. “It was a movement led by extremists to begin with, and we should not be surprised they turned to extremist tactics.” ITAC’s warning that only a dogmatic few would brave the Ottawa cold for Parliament’s return on 31 January proved to be a significant under-estimation. Yet, even that warning wasn’t heeded. The acting deputy chief of the Ottawa Police Service said in early February that they planned for “a potentially weekend-long demonstration”, and were caught off guard when the convoy parked in front of Parliament. “Was the problem that he didn’t have the information?” Carvin said. “Or was the problem that they just don’t take white supremacy seriously?” Carvin said intelligence agencies had been briefing the Canadian government as far back as late December on the possible threat posed by the convoy. “[The protest leaders] were exceptionally clear on what they wanted to do, and how they were going to go about doing it,” she said.",News/World news,"Violent extremists ‘likely’ infiltrated Ottawa protests, anti-terror agency warned ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/17/ottawa-protests-anti-terror-agency-warned-violent-extremists
2/18/2022,"The government has big plans for the green economy. There are targets galore: 2m skilled jobs by 2030, sale of petrol and diesel cars to be phased out by 2035, a net zero carbon economy by 2050. Having been the birthplace of the first industrial revolution in the 18th century, the idea is that the UK can again lead the way in the next phase of technological development. There is a 10-point plan for a green industrial revolution as a statement of intent.  All of which sounds mightily impressive. The problem is the claims of global leadership don’t tally with the hard data. Turnover in the low carbon and renewable energy sector was the same in 2020 as in 2014. The number of people employed has actually fallen by 28,000 to just over 200,000. To take a specific example, at the last count there were only 2,300 people working in the booming offshore wind sector – down by a third since the middle of the last decade. The reason is simple. Unlike oil and gas rigs, nobody works full time on the turbines and their manufacture has been outsourced to other countries. It is the same story in solar, where employment has dropped by 40% to 4,300. To be clear, the lack of tangible progress is not due to the pandemic because both jobs and turnover – according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics – were flat-lining even before the arrival of Covid-19. There are those who think the picture is brighter than the ONS figures suggest. Venture capital, they say, is alert to the opportunities to make money out of greening the economy and investment in new businesses is expanding fast. Even if the optimists are right, there is a long way to go. The problem could be a lack of commercially viable ideas, a lack of finance, a lack of government investment – or a combination of all three. But Frances O’Grady, the TUC’s general secretary, is right when she says Britain risks losing out to countries who modernise faster. There is a yawning gap between rhetoric and reality. Debt relief for the world’s poorest countries is way down the list of priorities for finance ministers and central bank governors from the G20 at the meeting chaired by Indonesia. While that’s unsurprising at a time of soaring energy prices, rising inflation and supply bottlenecks it is also short-sighted. The membership of the G20 includes the biggest developed and developing countries, and in the early stages of the pandemic it took steps to help the poorest nations. Debt repayments were suspended and a mechanism – the common framework – was created to provide longer-term relief. Results have been disappointing. Some creditors refused to take part in the temporary debt suspension initiative, which has now expired. Three countries – Chad, Zambia and Ethiopia – have signed up for help through the common framework but none has yet received any assistance. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund says 60% of low-income countries are in debt distress or at high risk of it. The World Bank calculates debt repayments from 74 low income countries will be $35bn (£26bn) this year – double the total in 2020. This is a debt crisis waiting to happen and decisive action from the G20 could still avert it. Debt relief needs to be swifter and it needs to be more generous. A workable scheme can’t just involve sovereign creditors: the G20 should insist the private sector takes part on the same terms. The credibility of the G20 is at stake here. Its critics say, with justification, that meetings have become global talking shops where participants indulge in virtue signalling and point scoring but achieve next to nothing. If the G20 can’t deliver a workable solution to the debts of low-income countries there really is no point to it. Although the details are scanty, peace has broken out in the credit card charges war between Amazon and Visa, as was always going to be the case. The online retail giant was never going to stop its UK customers paying with Visa but bridled at what it considered too steep an increase in transaction fees for both credit and debit cards. In order to secure lower transaction fees Amazon had to say that it was prepared to go nuclear. The fact that neither side is saying much about the deal suggests both are relatively happy with the outcome.",News/Environment,Hard data blows apart UK rhetoric on leading the way to a green economy,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/17/hard-data-blows-apart-uk-rhetoric-on-leading-the-way-to-a-green-economy
2/18/2022,"All-party parliamentary groups may be informal, but they provide a great service in our democracy. In good hands, they can foster better relations with other countries, keep a weather eye on an authoritarian regime, or bring into sharp focus a policy issue that may otherwise have been forgotten. In that vein, I set up the APPG on acquired brain injury, which produced a report with a list of recommendations after a series of round tables with patients, families and practitioners. Just before Christmas, that bore fruit in the shape of a government commitment to launch a new national strategy on the issue. So an APPG can make a big difference, and the vast majority are run simply and cheaply on the back of the enthusiasm of a few MPs and peers without any extra spending.  It’s also an important way of baking cross-party working into the system. No MP can launch their own APPG with the support of their party colleagues alone – they need support from across the benches. But I worry that the number of APPGs has risen dramatically in the last few years. Instead of one cancer APPG, there are now more than a dozen. Some industries are especially well-resourced, with every part of the supply chain and every trade body getting its own group. Some countries have more than one. We now have more APPGs than we do MPs. It sometimes feels as if every MP wants their own APPG, and every lobbying company sees them as an ideal way to make a quick buck out of a trade or industry body. “Look,” they say, “if you really want to get this on the agenda politically, we can get you access to MPs, peers and ministers – but the more financial support you give the APPG (through us, of course) the more effective the group will be.” Hence the rise in the number of APPGs that are serviced by lobbying, PR or communications companies. There are several problems with this. For a start, nobody should be touting access or influence on behalf of an APPG. Second, the rules on what APPGs have to register are pretty clear, but until now this has virtually been a self-policing area of policy. The Commons authorities have neither the powers nor resources to investigate every APPG, and since we abolished the requirement to get permission to launch a new one, the only substantial requirement for an APPG to keep going is to hold an annual general meeting. Sometimes these are so poorly attended as to make one question whether they are really an APPG or just a personal campaign or money-making venture masquerading as a parliamentary affair. I don’t think anyone is concerned when an APPG is supported by a charity. (The acquired brain injury APPG, incidentally, is supported by the UK ABI Forum.) But it may be time for us to ban commercial operators from acting as the secretariat for APPGs, unless they can prove a public interest and enough interest from a larger number of MPs and peers. When lobbying firms are effectively driving a group in the interests of their clients, we should not only know who those clients are, but we should be able to close down the group where there is a clear conflict of interest. Which takes me to another point. The House of Commons and the Lords both have formal select committees covering all the government departments. Proceedings in these committees, and their publications, are covered by parliamentary privilege, which is an important aspect of ensuring MPs and peers can speak without fear or favour. It would be – and is – wrong for any APPG to give the impression that one of its reports or publications has a parliamentary imprimatur or seal of approval. Newspaper editors would be well advised to stop referring vaguely to “a committee of MPs” and to start drawing a clear distinction between the authorised, privileged work of a select committee and the unauthorised work of an APPG. If you have evidence of something that doesn’t smell right in the way an APPG is run, the Committee on Standards on Public Life will run an inquiry into it. We can’t investigate individual groups, but we’d be happy to hear from you as background for our inquiry. I certainly don’t want to curtail the work of APPGs so much that their valuable work comes to an end. They are a vital tool in many backbench MPs’ campaigning armoury. But if an APPG feels like front-of-house for a direct commercial interest or a cover for free trips to exotic locations, or if it’s the brainchild of a lobbying company, then MPs and peers should run a mile. Chris Bryant is the Labour MP for Rhondda",Opinion/Opinion,MPs’ groups are taking millions from private interests – that can’t go unchecked  | Chris Bryant,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/17/mps-groups-millions-private-interests-all-party-parliamentary-groups
2/18/2022,"More than £13m has been poured into a growing network of MPs’ interest groups by private firms including healthcare bodies, arms companies and tech giants, fuelling concerns over the potential for backdoor influence. Analysis by the Guardian and Open Democracy found that more than half the total £25m in funding for all-party parliamentary groups (APPGs) since 2018 has come from the private sector.  Other funds for the 755 groups – a number that has ballooned from 560 five years ago – came from charities and trade unions. On Thursday, the chair of the Commons standards committee, Chris Bryant, for the first time called for parliamentary authorities to have the power to shut down the largely self-policed groups where there are clear conflicts of interest. Writing for the Guardian, he said it may be time to ban commercial operators from funding and running APPGs: “When lobbying firms are effectively driving an APPG in the interests of their clients, we should not only know who those clients are, but we should be able to close the group down where there is a clear conflict of interest.” Bryant, whose standards committee has opened an inquiry into the system, added: “It feels as if every MP wants their own APPG and every lobbying company sees an APPG as an ideal way of making a quick buck out of a trade or industry body.” APPGs are informal groups representing MPs’ and peers’ interests, from China and Russia to cancer, digital regulation, longevity and jazz. They must be chaired by MPs but are often run or funded by lobbyists and corporate donors seeking to influence government policy. The groups can play a key role drawing parliament’s attention to overlooked issues, Bryant says. They host roundtables, produce reports, take overseas trips and lobby for change but receive no public money. A number of APPGs are sponsored by companies with interests in the policy areas the groups seek to influence. In situations where there is no conflict of interest, concerns may arise over the perception of one. Examples include: The obesity APPG, which has sought to promote medical interventions for obesity, received £178,500 to £183,000 between 2019 and 2021 from three private healthcare companies that make or promote gastric bands or drugs used in obesity surgery and treatment: Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic and Novo Nordisk. The support was used to pay for a lobbyist, HealthComms Consulting, to run the APPG’s secretariat. The lobbyist says on its website that the APPG promoted calls for “a shift away from the ‘move more, eat less’ mentality prevalent in obesity thinking and better utilisation of treatment for obesity and access to services”. It adds that the APPG “had direct input into the government’s obesity strategy published in July 2020 through meeting with No 10 officials and the development of a top 10 policy wishlist”. The company did not respond to a request for comment. MPs from the armed forces APPG took a trip to Bosnia last autumn as it stood on the brink of conflict, with hospitality and transport part-funded by an arms company, Lockheed Martin, and the defence support company CAE. Lockheed Martin’s head of government affairs accompanied them for one night and to a dinner. A Tory MP on the visit, James Sunderland, subsequently spoke in a Commons debate about the need for the UK to be “part of the solution in the country [Bosnia]” without declaring the trip’s funding. James Gray, the APPG’s chairman, said the trip should have been declared as paid for by the APPG, of whom Lockheed Martin and CAE are “merely sponsors”. He said the companies “had nothing to gain” from the trip, and the subscribers to the APPG “do so because they believe in having a good group of MPs and peers who understand defence”. A Lockheed Martin spokesperson said funding for the visit “would have come from the APPG’s funds and not specifically from Lockheed Martin UK’s contributions”. Sunderland did not comment. In areas related to the climate crisis, the secretariat of the sustainable aviation APPG is an alliance of airlines and airports, while energy companies provided tens of thousands of pounds in the past year for the consultancy running the net zero APPG. Graham Brady, a senior Tory who chairs the sustainable aviation APPG, said it was formed to support collaboration between the aviation sector and parliament, adding: “The benefits in kind reported on the register represent routine secretarial work carried out to facilitate meetings of the group. No direct funding is involved and no benefits in kind have been given to members of the group.” Many APPGs have secretariats run by charities, trade unions and other organisations, which help with their administration and act as a contact point. A thriving industry has also emerged around professional lobbying companies, sponsored by corporate interests, helping to produce reports seeking to influence policy, fund dinners or drinks and take parliamentarians on free trips abroad. The Guardian and Open Democracy analysis found that since 2018, APPGs have declared £5m in cash funding and £18.3m-£20.2m of “benefits in kind” support, which covers the provision of services, secretarial work, trips or hospitality. More than half of the sponsorship and donations – about £13m – came from private companies. APPGs have been at the centre of controversies but remain largely self-policed. Last month a fresh spotlight fell on the groups after it emerged that a woman at the centre of an MI5 security alert to MPs had provided support and funding for the now disbanded Chinese in Britain APPG. In September, MPs on the standards committee raised questions over the longevity APPG offering platinum, gold and bronze tiers of membership for sponsors, with a fee of up to £100,000 for access to meetings with the group’s members. The APPG said it had dropped the scheme and no sponsor was ever involved in tiered membership. The largest APPG, the parliamentary internet, communications and technology forum (Pictfor), received more than £125,000 worth of benefits-in-kind support last year alone, from firms including Google, Facebook, TikTok, BT, Amazon and Huawei. The group also runs a tiered membership, with rates ranging from £500 for charities to £5,000 for large corporations, for “benefits” such as access to events. Pictfor denied any similarity to the longevity APPG scheme and said its membership did not represent a tiered system of opportunity or influence over the group or its members, but rather protected against it. Analysis of a range of other APPGs underlines the links between the MPs’ groups and private firms. The secretariat for the British bioethanol APPG is listed as Ensus UK, which operates one of the UK’s largest biofuel plants. After the APPG submitted a report to the government calling for the introduction of E10 fuel, which uses biofuel of the type manufactured by Ensus, a meeting was held between the APPG’s chair, a government minister and the commercial director of Ensus UK. Ensus said its support and “modest financial contribution” towards the APPG’s work on E10 was a matter of public record. New coronavirus-related APPGs include business in a pandemic (Covid) world, which has declared £49,000 of benefits-in-kind support for its secretariat, the lobbyist Wychwood Consulting, from a Covid diagnostics company, Cignpost. Neither Wychwood nor Cignpost responded to requests for comment. Wychwood also gets £10,000 to £12,000 of benefits-in-kind sponsorship from Yoti Ltd, a facial recognition company, to run the APPG on Digital Identity. Yoti said it was open about its sponsorship of the APPG, which provides a unique service to parliamentarians as a forum to discuss and educate them on digital identity. Arms companies are particularly active, with firms including BAE Systems, Lockheed Martin and the missile maker Raytheon supporting the armed forces APPG with £256,000 over four years. A Lockheed Martin UK spokesperson said: “This support is openly and transparently registered in the register of APPGs.” The technology and national security APPG, formed in 2020, received support worth up to £39,000 from Rebellion Defence Ltd, a US-UK defence AI company which has the former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt as an investor and board member, among others. The “benefit in kind” support allows for the APPG’s secretariat to be provided by an Oxford University defence studies centre where one of Rebellion’s co-founders is a research fellow. Rebellion Defence and the APPG declined to comment. All APPGs must be registered and provide funding details but most do not produce or make readily available a detailed breakdown. They are obliged to provide accounts on request but half of 190 APPGs failed to do so when asked by Open Democracy. APPGs are required only to complete a simple “template for income and expenditure statement” but this does not give opportunity to provide many details. The alternative dispute resolution APPG’s form listed £4,501-£6,000 for secretariat services and £13,501-£16,000 for a visit to Singapore, with no further detail. The group was approached for comment. Some APPGs, such as the group for the Celtic Sea and another for the wood panel industry, have a lobbyist as a secretariat but no figures for funding were published on their parliamentary registration page. Their chair was contacted for comment. Some other APPGS gave fuller details. On the comprehensive Pictfor website, accounts were uploaded to its blog section. Steve Goodrich, of Transparency International, said: “From big tobacco to kleptocratic regimes, there are a plethora of interests behind these groups that remain [largely] unchecked by formal rules. Without greater transparency over lobbying, much of what happens in these groups will remain behind closed doors.” The government did not comment.",News/Politics,Lobbying fears as MPs’ interest groups receive £13m from private firms,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/17/lobbying-fears-as-mps-interest-groups-receive-13m-from-private-firms
2/18/2022,"For charities and campaigning backbenchers like the late Sir David Amess, Westminster’s all-party parliamentary groups (APPGs) are vital platforms for a plethora of good causes and interest areas they wish to promote. To their critics, they can appear as unreformed relics of a past, less-regulated Westminster landscape. But amid the swirl of roundtable discussions, drinks, overseas trips and reports, dozens of communications and public affairs companies are helping to run more than 100 such groups, out of a total of 755, with sponsorship from corporate interests.  The full reach of lobbyists acting as APPG secretariats – arranging meetings and trips for members and sometimes cultivating potential funders – is revealed in analysis by the Guardian and Open Democracy. A framework of rules applies to APPGs, setting out how to register if they wish to use parliamentary emblems and how to list the details of any secretariats. However, the system is largely self-policed. Connect Communications, which is co-owned and run by the former Labour MP Andy Sawford, runs the secretariats of 14 APPGs. Policy Connect, a not-for-profit company that has held meetings attended by paying businesses and ministers, runs the secretariats of nine APPGs, covering issues ranging from climate change to data analytics. It said that any private meetings involving ministers were always led by the APPG chair. Healthcare firms provided the bulk of about £250,000 worth of financial benefits-in-kind support registered in 2021 for six APPG secretariats operated by HealthComms Consulting, the lobbying firm founded by Paul Bristow, the current Conservative MP for Peterborough, and now run by his wife, Sara Petela. Her firm acts as the secretariat of the APPGs on adult social care, obesity, sepsis, women’s health, vascular and venous disease and minimally invasive cancer therapies. HealthComms Consulting was renamed in 2020 from its previous incarnation, PB Consulting, which had been founded by Bristow and had offered clients services such “NHS market access” and “parliamentary awareness”. Bristow, a former lobbying industry leader who sits on the Commons health select committee, was embroiled in controversy in 2020 when he submitted questions to ministers on a range of health issues linked to the lobbying firm without raising a potential conflict of interest, though he subsequently declared the link. Bristow told the Guardian he had led calls to ban MPs from lobbying and to “clean up the system”, adding: “When doing so, I have been very clear about my wife’s role and I don’t have any involvement with her company, which follows the PRCA [Public Relations and Communications Association] self-regulatory code of conduct. “I also support changes to the rules on APPGs because there are far too many and most are pointless. The ones with secretariats tend to be more effective and those arrangements are declared.” Four APPGs list their secretariats as the College Green Group, a political consultancy founded by Vote Leave’s former chief technology officer, Thomas Borwick. The company’s website previously claimed that “under 10% of APPGs currently achieve their full potential” and offered parliamentarians the chance to “let us catapult your APPG to the top of the league table” by creating “a coalition of organisations and businesses as affiliates or supporters to recruit sponsors” for a fee. College Green, which said it removed the text in the course of a website upgrade, told the Guardian that “league table” was shorthand for how some APPGs achieve more than others in terms of activity. It now describes its role as secretariat for the groups as “allowing for cross-party, issue-based problem solving, with high-level activity and management”. Asked how it recruited sponsors of APPGs, College Green Group said: “We engage with businesses and organisations that have an authentic interest in the topic of focus for each APPG. Based on these conversations we make recommendations to the APPG and, if all parties are in agreement, we engage the sponsors.” The corporate governance APPG received money from British American Tobacco, Deloitte, PwC and others, with support totalling well over £100,000 in recent years to pay for a secretariat run by Jennifer Bryant-Pearson, a lobbyist.",News/Politics,From climate to health: the private firms helping to run MPs’ interest groups,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/17/from-climate-to-health-the-private-firms-helping-to-run-mps-interest-groups
2/18/2022,"Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, has been criticised after saying she wants police to “shoot your terrorists and ask questions second.” Speaking to Matt Forde’s Political Party podcast, Rayner said she was “quite hardline” on law and order and suggested police should “antagonise” criminals.  “On things like law and order I am quite hardline. I am like, shoot your terrorists and ask questions second,” Rayner told the live audience at the podcast recording. After a loud audience reaction, she said. “Sorry – is that the most controversial thing I’ve ever said?” “On law and order, I think if you are being terrorised by the local thug, I want a copper to come and sort them out,” she said. “You should be hardline on things like that. It’s not just, ‘Oh you’ve been burgled here is a crime number’.” She added: “I want you to beat down the door of the criminals and sort them out and antagonise them. That’s what I say to my local police … three o’clock in the morning and antagonise them.” Rayner said she had formed her views after being “plagued by antisocial behaviour” when she was growing up. “I want the police to annoy the hell out of them until they realise disrupting lives is not OK. I am quite hardline on that,” she said. Rayner has also spoken out recently about receiving extensive online abuse and death threats. Among those criticising Rayner was the former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, who said: “Is Angela suggesting a mandatory death sentence for suspected (but not convicted) “terrorists” ?” she tweeted. Rayner was also criticised by the leftwing grassroots group Momentum. Sonali Bhattacharyya, of Momentum’s national coordinating group, said: “These remarks are deeply concerning. It was this approach that led to the assassination of Jean Charles de Menezes. “You can’t kneel for racial justice one day, then praise shoot-to-kill powers for the police the next. “From regressive drug policy to abandoning the rule of law, Labour are trying to out-Tory the Tories. But it’s working class communities and people of colour who pay the price for this law and order agenda. In the party and the streets, our movement will stand up for social justice.” Corbyn himself had been vocally against “shoot to kill” policies. ““I think that is quite dangerous and I think it can often be counterproductive. I think you have to have security which prevents people firing off weapons where you can and there are various degrees of doing things, as we know, but the idea you end up with a war on the streets is not a good thing,” he said in 2015.",News/Politics,Angela Rayner: police should ‘shoot terrorists and ask questions second’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/17/angela-rayner-police-should-shoot-terrorists-and-ask-questions-second
2/18/2022,"The regional president of Madrid has accused the leadership of her own conservative People’s party (PP) of waging a “cruel and unfair” campaign to destroy her with false corruption allegations amid reports the party tried to hire private detectives to investigate her family. Isabel Díaz Ayuso, who is often touted as a future PP leader, spoke out after media reports suggested that, during the first wave of the Covid pandemic, her administration gave a €1.5m contract for face masks to a company linked to her brother – for which he received a commission.  The reports also alleged that an official in Madrid city hall – which is also run by the PP – contacted a firm of private detectives with a view to getting them to investigate Ayuso and her family. Relations between Ayuso and the PP’s leader, Pablo Casado, have been fraught over recent months. While Ayuso has bolstered her national and international profile since winning an emphatic victory in last year’s Madrid regional election, Casado has faced questions over his leadership strategies – not least the party’s recent, pyrrhic victory in last week’s Castilla y León regional election. On Thursday morning, the PP mayor of Madrid, José Luis Martínez-Almeida, said he had looked into the reports that his administration had sought to hire a detective firm to spy on Ayuso and her family, and said he had found no evidence of such an arrangement. A little later, Ayuso went on the offensive. “Even though political life is full of heartaches, I could never have imagined that the national leadership of my party would act against me in such a cruel and unfair way,” she said in a televised address. “There is nothing more serious than accusing someone in your own house, and who has a responsibility to govern, of corruption.” Ayuso said that PP leaders had spent months putting together a dossier on her and her family in an attempt to associate them with corruption when all the party had to do was look at publicly available documents relating to the contract. “The fact that they were preparing a file means that they weren’t searching for any truth; they were trying to smear me personally and politically,” she said. Ayuso did not deny that the face mask contract had been awarded to a company linked to her brother, but she insisted the process had been completely legal. “I asked my brother and he confirmed that he had had a business relationship with the company and that it was all completely legal, and that everything had been declared to the tax authorities,” she said. She also challenged Casado and his circle to provide any proof whatsoever of wrongdoing, and pointed to her own electoral success. “I’d like to know how many votes those who have spent months attacking me have won for the PP,” she said. “It’s very hurtful that the leaders of you party are not the ones who support you, but the ones who want to destroy you.” The PP’s general secretary, Teodoro García Egea, hit back at Ayuso later on Thursday, saying that it had only sought her cooperation in examining the allegations, and adding that an investigation had been launched. “Since we received information about these alleged irregularities over the summer and asked Isabel Díaz Ayuso about their veracity, all we’ve got from that direction – instead of a clear answer – is a massive campaign of attacks, packs of lies and slanders like the ones we’ve had today,” he said.

2/18/2022,"A former Post Office branch manager’s young children were bullied and told their mum was a “liar” and a “thief” during the company’s IT system scandal, an inquiry has heard. More than 700 post office operators were prosecuted between 2000 and 2014, based on information from the Horizon IT system, which was installed and maintained by Fujitsu.  Susan Hazzleton, 68, said her children, who were nine at the time, were taunted in the school playground when her Post Office branch in Chelmsford, Essex closed in 2001. Her children were told that their mother was a “liar”, a “thief” and that she was “the reason the village doesn’t have a Post Office or shop any more”, Hazzleton said during the fourth day of evidence. The former post office operator was accused of stealing £300 after auditors checked the accounts of the branch she had run since 1995. She was suspended, her shop closed and six weeks later she was arrested for theft. “[The police] said I couldn’t go and pick the children up from school, they said they would collect them in the police car, take them to the station and they would have to stay there until they finished questioning me,” Hazzleton recalled. “What mother wants that for her children?” Thankfully, her children were able to stay with a family friend. The prosecution dropped the case 18 months later due to a lack of evidence. Hazzleton said Post Office workers told her that no one else was having issues with the Horizon IT system like the ones that she told them she had been having. She said that the shortfalls in her accounts began to “snowball” into the thousands in 2000 after she began using the Horizon system. She said she called the Post Office helpline once a week but received no help. The call handler repeatedly told her: “It will work itself out”, the inquiry heard. “I believed the people operating the helpline had no more idea about the computer system than I did,” she said. After her evidence, Judge Sir Wyn Williams questioned whether the compensation scheme should apply to those who were acquitted, as well as wrongly convicted. Wendy Martin, who opened her own Post Office in York in February 2015, said she was left feeling like a “walking zombie” due to the stress of dealing with repeated IT problems. She told the inquiry: “I was open for just under two years and I probably slept five hours a week if that. “I was getting so many kidney infections constantly that my doctor would leave my prescriptions in reception without me having to go in because I didn’t have time to go into the doctors. “My staff were so stressed out that one of them left, she couldn’t deal with it any more. We were all just falling apart.” She said there were issues with the Horizon computer system immediately after taking over the branch. “I just know that we had gone from an office that worked to where I was coming home of a night and I just didn’t know where the cash figures would sit,” she said. “I would check my figures and check the cash and it would show a discrepancy and I’d think, what have I done?” Martin was never prosecuted but has still been left thousands of pounds in debt. She added: “I’ve lost my business and that business was my retirement. I don’t have a retirement; I’ve worked for the Post Office for 16 years and walked away with nothing.” The inquiry, which is expected to run for the rest of the year, is looking into whether the Post Office knew about faults in the IT system and will also ask how staff were made to take the blame.

2/18/2022,"There is something very satisfying about going, in the space of a few months, from neophyte, to expert, to outraged dissenter, and enjoying that journey alongside thousands of others. I’m talking about Wordle, obviously, the five stages of which, after its invention in October last year, might usefully be delineated as indifference, confusion, enjoyment, obsession and resolution to cancel the New York Times. Here we are in February and it’s a new world, teetering for some of us on the brink of post-Wordle. I’m not quite ready to jump. But after a week of scandalous decisions by the NYT, the puzzle’s new owners, it’s only a matter of time.  This is a sad outcome given the ancillary pleasures that come with the game. As in all things, I was not an early adopter, only giving in and trying a Wordle when friends with even less interest in puzzles than me got sucked in and triggered my competitive machinery. For the past five weeks, I have patiently and conscientiously done a puzzle a day, while enjoying all the benefits of my new hobby. I have made judgments about people who post their results. I have made judgments about myself, primarily how brilliant I am. During a bout of insomnia, I’ve shared my grid at 3am with someone who has sent me their middle-of-the-night results, an action I have understood, obliquely, to be both a boast and a small cry for help. I’ve texted the word “genius” to people when they’ve solved the puzzle in two and received the same validation in return. I’ve wondered if I’m rescuing myself from dementia. And of course, in the last week or so, I have given much thought as to whether, under new management, the words are getting harder. All of which experience is probably very quaint and familiar to veterans of these kinds of games. Here’s another discovery that we – the interlopers, the people who only-like-football-during-the-two-weeks-of-the-World Cup but with puzzles – have discovered a land in which the inhabitants couldn’t have been nicer. Who are these lovely people, with their tolerance for our amazement that word games can be fun? For my entire life, I’ve been operating under the delusion that other people are my people, when in fact, these people might be my true people. It’s a wild ride. “Is it an indication of smartness?” asks the friend with whom I trade scores. “Definitely,” I say, but when I click on the millionth Wordle story of the day, I discover that it’s ability in maths, not words, that’s considered the key. (I am not good at maths). This makes sense given my history with word games. I’ve always hated Scrabble and had no time for crosswords. Boggle didn’t take. It has been a source of small but real sorrow to me that if I’d been alive during the second world war, I wouldn’t have been picked to code-break at Bletchley. But Wordle, for some reason, is different. For me, the fact it’s on a device definitely helps, allowing me to stare at a screen and still feel virtuous. It’s to Wordle’s advantage that it takes so little time to complete – if you haven’t nailed it in 20 minutes, it’s a lost cause – making it seem like a manageable addiction. Like slow-release drugs, you can’t binge Wordle, all of which adds up to an experience we haven’t had for a long time, of having to wait for something for 24 hours, with no possibility of cheating. Would appreciate privacy at this difficult time.Wordle 243 X/6🟩🟩🟩⬜🟩🟩🟩🟩⬜🟩🟩🟩🟩⬜🟩🟩🟩🟩⬜🟩🟩🟩🟩⬜🟩🟩🟩🟩⬜🟩 Which brings us to the New York Times, effortless ruiner of all things. This week, the kerfuffle was about two answers being generated on the same day, but that was an administrative error. The main thing is the choice of words. I’m not sure the puzzle is getting harder – I’m still thinking about the word “tapir”, which appeared in one of the early games. But there is something different about Wordle now it’s under Big Puzzle management. On Wednesday, I got “caulk” – a word I associate with “spackle” and is annoyingly obscure – but this morning, for the first time, I bombed out and didn’t get the word. This wasn’t because it was hard, but because it was easy and I’d wasted two tries on obscure words that I thought were more likely to come out of the NYT’s puzzle desk. It’s not going to be “cakes,” is it, I thought; it’s going to be something aggravating, like “slake” (it wasn’t either). Take it from a puzzles veteran of five weeks, once you stop trusting the puzzle-master, it’s all over and I can feel my interest curdling, a withdrawal helped along by my seven-year-old. “Oh,” she said flatly, when I showed her a Wordle this week. “It’s hangman.” Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist ",Opinion/Opinion,My five-letter reaction to the New York Times taking over Wordle?

2/18/2022,"Back in 2008, the Pope’s O’Rangers got to the final of Big Vase with a team spearheaded by Jean-Claude Darcheville. The centre of their defence was marshalled by David Weir, 83. To his right, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Kirk Broadfoot, breathing heavily, brow furrowed, a confused look spreading across his coupon. The late and lamented Walter Smith achieved many great things during a life less ordinary, but taking that team to a major Uefa showpiece occasion was arguably his most outrageous achievement of all. Sheer alchemy, multiplied by chutzpah on the end of a stick. Gotta love Walter.  Nothing is impossible, in other words, and that’s surely what the Newc O’ Rangers manager, Giovanni van Bronckhorst, will be telling his men before Thursday’s trip to Borussia Dortmund in the catchily titled knockout round play-offs of this year’s even-more-interminable-than-usual Big Vase. Marco Rose’s side are currently keeping Bayern Munich honest in the Bundesliga, six points behind and not quite out of hope yet, and are the bookies’ favourites to win Big Vase outright, ahead of Barcelona and some properly run clubs like Sevilla, Fizzy Leipzig and Atalanta. By comparison, you can get 150s on James Tavernier lifting Uefa’s secondary jug come May. Oh O’Rangers! Uh-oh! However, Dortmund’s superstar striker Erling Haaland – 28 goals already for club and country this season, but absent for nearly a month – could be missing through injury this evening. Also, it’s not as though the German giants are without their own problems, having been shafted at home 5-2 by perennial losers Bayer Leverkusen a couple of weeks ago, a result nearly as embarrassing as Rangers’ recent dirty protest at Parkhead. Van Bronckhorst’s men have responded well to that humiliation, winning three games on the bounce to the aggregate score of 10-0. Add some positive thinking to the mix, along the lines of “well, if Kirk did it”, and you never know, they could yet pull off a result for the ages. Either that or we’ll have further evidence that, by unceremoniously bolting out of the Ibrox exit door, Steven Gerrard has made his best-timed run since the one that put Liverpool two up in the 2001 final.

2/18/2022,"The percentage of adults in the US who identify as LGBTQ has doubled over the past 10 years, a Gallup study has found.  According to poll results released Thursday, a record 7.1% of American adults identify as LGBTQ, jumping from 3.5% in 2012. “The increase in LGBT identification in recent years largely reflects the higher prevalence of such identities among the youngest US adults compared with the older generations they are replacing in the US adult population,” Gallup noted of the poll, which was conducted in 2021 on 12,416 American adults. The poll also found that 21% of Generation-Z Americans – those born between 1997 and 2003 – who have reached adulthood identify as LGBTQ, more than double the proportion of millennial adults who do so. Among millennials – those born between 1981 and 1996 – 10.5% identify as LGBTQ. This marks a modest 4.7% increase from 2012, when some members of the generation had not yet turned 18. The percentages are even smaller among Generation X, baby boomers and “traditionalists” – all below 10%. Only 4.2% of Generation X adults, who are between 42 and 57, identify as LGBTQ. 2.6% of baby boomers, who are between 58 to 76, identify as LGBTQ. Lastly, among traditionalist adults – those born before 1946 – only 0.8% identify as LGBTQ. Those percentages have more or less remained unchanged since Gallup started measuring LGBTQ identification in 2012. In addition, the poll found that more than half of LGBTQ Americans, 57%, identify as bisexual, making up 4% of the total US adult population. Twenty-one percent of LGBT Americans identify as gay, 14% lesbian, 10% transgender and 4% something else. Nearly one in six Gen-Z adults, or 15%, identify as bisexual. Meanwhile, 6% of millennials and 2% of Gen Xers say they are bisexual. The percentages of those who identify as bisexual among Generation X, baby boomers and traditionalists fall below 2%. According to the study, women, 6%, are more likely than men, 2%, to indicate that they are bisexual. Men are more likely to identify as gay, 2.5%, than bisexual. Gallup predicts that with one in 10 millennials and one in five Gen-Z members identifying as LGBTQ, the proportion of LGBTQ American adults should exceed 10% in the near future. “These young adults [Generation Z] are coming of age, including coming to terms with their sexuality or gender identity, at a time when Americans increasingly accept gays, lesbians and transgender people, and LGBT individuals enjoy increasing legal protection against discrimination,” Gallup said.

2/18/2022,"The dryly factual subtitle of Hans Abrahamsen’s Schnee, “10 canons for nine instruments”, hardly hints at the magical sonorities and glittering reflections explored in this 55-minute work, which was composed between 2006 and 2008. In the 1990s Abrahamsen wrote almost nothing, and he returned to composition tentatively, first with a series of orchestrations of both his own and other composers’ music, and then with a piano concerto in which he first explored the sound world he had reimagined for himself.  In Schnee that crystalline new world reached its definitive form, conjured from trios of strings and woodwind, together with two pianos and percussion. Its starting point was a series of arrangements of Bach canons that Abrahamsen had made in the early 1990s, but there’s nothing remotely Bachian about his response. The 10 canons of Schnee come in complementary pairs, each of which the composer likens to two versions of a painting in different colours. They are separated by more static intermezzos, while the canons become progressively shorter as the work goes on, with microtones regularly blurring the edges of their intricate plays of pitches. It proved to be the gateway to so much that has followed in Abrahamsen’s music – to the equally fragile soundscapes of the extraordinary song-cycle Let Me Tell You, and more explicitly to his Hans Christian Andersen opera The Snow Queen, first performed in 2019; the first of the canons in Schnee underpins the opening scene of the opera, while the torrential fourth provided the material for the Snow Queen’s sleigh ride through the snow. Schnee is already available on disc, played by Ensemble Recherche, who originally commissioned it. But this performance from the Lapland Chamber Orchestra, conducted by John Storgårds, seems to capture both the rigour and feathery fragility of Abrahamsen’s instrumental writing far more bewitchingly, with tempi that are consistently faster than the earlier version. Alongside its delicacy and sense of wonder, the Recherche performance now seems rather matter-of-fact, and the glittering intricacies of Abrahamsen’s canons are never that. A number of Harrison Birtwistle’s major scores, including two of his operas, have yet to appear on disc, but a collection from the Nash Ensemble on BIS does at least fill in some of the gaps among his gnarly chamber works. It concentrates on music from the past decade or so, though the origins of Pulse Sampler, for oboe and percussion, date back to 1981. The most substantial piece is the 20-minute Duet for Eight Strings, written in 2018 for the viola player Lawrence Power and cellist Adrian Brendel, who play it here; they are joined by pianist Tim Horton for the 2011 Piano Trio, while Gareth Hulse is the oboist in the Oboe Quartet, which began life as a single movement for the great Heinz Holliger, but which Birtwistle expanded in 2010 at the request of the Nash.",Arts/Music,Abrahamsen: Schnee review | Andrew Clements's classical album of the week,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/17/abrahamsen-schnee-review-lapland-chamber-orchestra-john-storgards
2/18/2022,"Stephen Colbert checked in on the crisis over Ukraine on Wednesday evening, a day after Russia claimed to be withdrawing some of its 150,000 troops from the border. Nato promptly disputed that claim, “and if you’re feeling confused, that’s on purpose”, said the Late Show host. “Because according to the experts, the US and Russia are waging a signaling war to avert an actual war.”  “Yes, a signaling war, just like in that famous movie: Semaphoring Private Ryan,” Colbert quipped. In other Russia news, one of its elite figure skaters, 15-year-old Kamila Valieva, tested positive for a banned substance before the Winter Olympics in Beijing. “Fifteen-year-olds on drugs should not be in the Olympics. They should be on Euphoria,” said Colbert. Facing international outrage, Valieva claimed the drug got in her system via a mix-up with her grandfather’s heart medication. “Yes, come on, you know how it goes! You’re in the kitchen and all of a sudden you trip and fall on to your grandpa’s day-of-the-week pill case,” Colbert mocked. “Now all of a sudden you’re skating around high on a cocktail of Centrum, Lipitor and Viagra.” Because she is 15, Valieva is protected from certain sanctions, allowing her to still compete in the individual figure skating competition. “They didn’t have a choice! If they didn’t allow her to skate, Putin would’ve just rolled her out there on a tank,” Colbert joked. On Thursday, after Colbert’s taping, Valieva faltered in her free skate program, dashing her hopes for a medal. But if she had finished in the top three, no medal ceremony would have been held for the event. “They’ll just ship the medals out to whoever won them later,” Colbert explained, “because every athlete trains their entire life for that magic moment when they can stand at attention on their stoop waiting for the UPS guy. Maybe ask the driver to honk the national anthem.” Nelson Mandela’s old house is now a luxury hotel.

That’s it. I wouldn’t be shocked if in a hundred years the White House is going to be turned into Jeff Bezos’s dog’s weekend place. “Some people think that it doesn’t make sense for the home of the man who fought inequality to be turned into a luxury hotel,” he continued. “But it does, it actually does. And it really does if you remember one of Mandela’s most famous quotes, when he said: ‘Do not judge me by the color of my skin, but rather judge me by the thread count of these Egyptian cotton sheets.’” The controversial hotel “is going to come with its pros and its cons”, Noah added, “and I guess it will be good for the people who work there and maybe some of the community, but you’ve gotta admit, man, at the same time, it does feel a little disrespectful for everything that Nelson Mandela went through, you know? You’re just going to pay some money, and you can sleep in his house? You know what he had to do to get to that house?” Noah proposed a compromise: “They should say that for every night that you stay in the hotel, you should also have to spend a night in an apartheid prison. Now you’re getting the full experience.” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel responded to Trump’s response to his former accountancy firm, Mazars, which severed ties with the former president amid ongoing criminal and civil investigations into whether he illegally inflated the worth of his assets. In a furious four-page statement, Trump countered: “We have a great company with fantastic assets that are unique, extremely valuable and, in many cases, far more valuable than what was listed in our Financial Statements.” “Only Donald Trump would defend himself against charges that he overvalued his assets by re-overvaluing his assets,” said Kimmel. Trump also blasted the New York attorney general, Letitia James, who is Black, and called for “this political and racist attack” to stop. “Now that’s a good one,” Kimmel said. “Rich white guy claiming racism? I mean, you almost have to hand it to him. That’s like Hawaii claiming tourism. That’s ridiculous.” Joe Biden, meanwhile, ordered the release of Trump’s White House visitor logs “once they fish them out of the White House septic tank”, Kimmel joked. “Trump’s been trying to block the House committee from trying to see this list, claiming executive privilege,” he added. “I feel like the only thing we’re going to learn from the list is how often he ordered Arby’s on Uber Eats or something.”",Arts/Culture,"Colbert on Ukraine crisis: ‘If you’re feeling confused, that’s on purpose’",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/17/stephen-colbert-ukraine-trevor-noah-jimmy-kimmel
2/18/2022,"Islands have always attracted writers and readers as rich fictional microcosms. An island setting can be a paradise, retreat or prison, preserver of wilderness or tradition, test of survival skills. And the global malaise of climate change and Covid-19 may have intensified their allure because, in spite of rising oceans, island novels are springing up all over. Just by chance, I have read three impressive examples recently: Audrey Magee’s The Colony, about an Irish-speaking island community during the Troubles; Norwegian Lars Mytting’s The Sixteen Trees of the Somme, partly set in Shetland, the Scottish islands where I have family roots; and now The Islands, a debut novel by Australian writer Emily Brugman.  Brugman draws on her unusual family story as a descendant of Finnish post-second world war migrants who became fishers on the Abrolhos Islands off Western Australia. This chain of dots in the Indian Ocean and its sliver of history are unfamiliar to most Australians, let alone the rest of the world, so she does not need to veer far from the facts to bring a fresh cultural story into Australian literature. The Islands follows an ensemble of characters centred around three generations of the Saari family. In 1959 Onni Saari is a young man with the dangerous job of laying dynamite in the lead mines of Western Australia. But it is his brother Nalle who has disappeared at sea. Onni makes the daylong boat trip from Geraldton to Little Rat Island, and when Nalle does not return he takes up his valuable cray fishing lease, bringing his wife, Alva, to join the small seasonal community. The men are torn between wealth and danger, hardened by work, weather and alcohol; characters with nicknames such as One-eyed Esko, Tall Tommi and Latvian Igor. As the joke goes: “There once was a Finn who loved his wife so much, he almost told her.” Brugman lingers on the women who make homes in the rough camps: the straight-talking older Petra, the artist Helvi, and soon Alva’s daughter Hilda, among other children. Pregnancy and child rearing are risky in such isolation, but Alva prefers the island’s simple freedom to winters on the mainland, where neighbours dismiss them as peasants. There are delightful surprises in the Nordic cold-weather traditions carried on in the sweltering south. Onni builds a sauna where the Finns sweat and socialise. They celebrate midsummer in winter, sing old songs and speak Finnish, which is sampled in bilingual bites. They live by superstitions, unnerved by dying birds and open cupboard doors. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Just as vivid are the islands themselves, mainly inhabited by abundant wildlife, and “dry as bone, the skeletal remains of coral bodies deposited over thousands of years by the push and pull of the current”. Brugman spent time in a shack on Little Rat Island and recreates with sensuous immediacy the slapping water, the sea creatures, the constantly changing sea and sky. The fishers are haunted by the wreck of the Batavia, for which the Abrolhos Islands are most notorious. When the Dutch ship hit a coral reef north of Little Rat in 1629, many drowned and survivors were terrorised, raped and murdered by mutineers. Nothing so dramatic happens in The Islands, though there are ominous echoes. Brugman acknowledges Thea Astley’s Drylands and Elizabeth Strout’s Olive Kitteridge as influences on her novel-in-stories form. Characters move in and out of focus and the narrative takes its quiet momentum – with some leaps in time – from their daily routines and changes of fortune over decades. As Onni and Alva age, Hilda grows up Australian, makes her own mistakes and raises her own daughter. With such an evocative setting, Brugman could have pushed her creativity further, but her stories of family, place and industry are enough. The Islands sits comfortably between social history and imaginative fiction. The writing often rises into the realms of metaphor with pungent, poetic language and chapter headings – Pink snapper, Sea lion, Driftwood, Osprey – symbolising the characters’ experiences. By the end, Brugman has made us care for these hardy people, whose lives she inhabits with curiosity and affection. If we thought we knew the whole story of European immigration to Australia, The Islands extends our horizon in yet another fascinating direction.

Her family believe she was more vulnerable to the disease because she was nursing a broken heart after the death of her daughter. A mother to three children and grandmother to six, it’s unlikely Merilyn, 79, would have been in aged care if it weren’t for the shock death of her daughter, says her brother, Colin Hughes. He says the grief of losing a child made the last few years of Merilyn’s life “very, very hard”. “Merilyn went downhill,” he says. “She got very, very depressed to the point she could no longer look after herself at home, and that’s how she ended up in aged care. “She wasn’t physically ill, she was extremely fit, always strong, but she had severe mental health problems. The last two years were absolutely tragic.” Before her daughter’s death and the pandemic, though, her life was a full one. Merilyn “Mem” Saunders was born on 22 November 1943. Dux of her high school and an extremely active student, she would go on to study teaching, specialising in PE. Her first job was at Coburg High school in Melbourne’s north, where she taught physical education to the future Olympic athlete Raelene Boyle and Australian rules footballer Robert Walls. “She was really good at sport – always won the races at school and swimming, played tennis and netball,” Colin said. “So she had a terrific time.” After she married her husband, Ivan, Merilyn relocated to England and then Canada where she worked as an exchange teacher before starting a family in Melbourne. The couple set up a business, while Ivan represented the council on Melbourne’s Bayside. “She enjoyed social life, being a councillor’s wife,” Colin says. In her later life, Merilyn joined the Ashton-Smith Singers of Australia, an amateur choral ensemble founded in the 1980s by David Ashton-Smith. Performing in the group saw her rub shoulders with the late actor Rob Guest and soprano Marina Prior, who Merilyn eventually befriended. “It was a really lovely thing for Mem; she adored singing and music – was a talented pianist and singer,” Colin says. “She’d always make sure she got herself a photo with Marina and Rob.” Then, four years ago, Merilyn’s daughter Gabrielle passed away in WA, aged just 40. Merilyn travelled there the Christmas after, and took Gabrielle’s daughter Evangeline on a cruise from Darwin to Perth. It was a deeply traumatic time for Merilyn who, on her return to Melbourne, had a mental breakdown, and was admitted to an aged care facility soon after in 2019. Colin says because of the pandemic and extended lockdowns in Victoria, which prevented her from having visitors, Merilyn psychologically “shut down”. “[Her] lifelong friends, her boys … we weren’t allowed to visit from WA and our brother was going through his own health problems, my brother wasn’t allowed to visit,” he says. “Her last two years were spent almost entirely in isolation.” Then, in January of 2022, she caught Covid. After she tested positive to the virus, Merilyn had given an end of life directive and decided against active treatment. “She was a bright girl, she knew what the consequences of that action were likely to be fatal,” Colin says. “Covid is many different illnesses … it can affect you from the respiratory point of view and cause severe anxiety and distress. She didn’t have oxygen problems – maybe because of her strong lungs – but she had gastrointestinal problems … severe nausea, vomiting, inability to hold down food … that was the cause of her death.” Colin is at pains to point out that the staff at Merilyn’s aged care facility took great care of his sister – as well as they could under extremely testing circumstances. “They were wonderful,” he says. “Despite huge problems they followed directives to the letter, and because I’m a doctor they were giving me daily reports on her oxygen. “We don’t hear from politicians what a good job the aged care staff are doing despite the huge challenges. The nursing aides looked after her in the last couple of years really well – and through lockdown, [residents] didn’t get Covid.” At this point in time, only one person has died at Mercy Place Corben – Merilyn. “They were exactly who they said they were, kind, considerate, compassionate,” Colin says. “They arranged Zoom calls when she was still able to receive them, they put in place mental health care plans, they did everything they could.” But as a former GP, Colin is convinced that if the government had intervened and provided free rapid antigen tests to aged care facilities when Omicron started to spread, Merilyn may not have acquired the virus. “Instead of a policy that said everyone who comes to a nursing home has to have a RAT before entry, there was no proper infectious control,” he says. “I’m not blaming the nursing home for that, I just watched this government completely ignore the public health issues and try to pretend vaccination alone was the way out. “Public health measures are still so important – N95 masks, proper PPE which they were struggling to get a hold of in nursing homes, free rapid tests … so many people are suffering [but] politicians are not listening. “The government could buy for a couple of dollars a rapid antigen test and an N95 mask. We’re letting these people die; it’s so ludicrous.” When Merilyn passed away, she became another Covid statistic: a 79-year-old woman who died in aged care, pre-existing conditions. As of 4 February, 9,718 aged care residents across almost 2,000 facilities in Australia had acquired the virus. Since July last year, 801 people in aged care had passed away. When Colin remembers his sister, he remembers a woman who loved to have fun, to dress up, to live her life to the fullest; a woman who got a kick out of sailing a boat in a strong wind. At the celebration of her life, the family played Time to Say Goodbye (Con te partirò), a soaring orchestral ballad first performed by Andrea Bocelli in 1995: Time to say goodbye,To countries I never saw and shared with youNow, yes, I shall see them, I’ll go with youGo on ships across seas,Which, I know, no, no, don’t exist any moreIt’s time to say goodbye … “That was Merilyn,” Colin says. “In the photos of her at the funeral … she was a Carnaby Street girl – she had the miniskirts, the big bouffant hair, always dressed to perfection. She loved having a good time. “She loved life, she loved her music, she loved sport, and she loved me … “She loved me, and I loved her. That’s all I have to say.”",News/Australia news,‘We’re letting these people die’: a family’s anguish for Melbourne grandmother lost to Covid in aged care,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/18/were-letting-these-people-die-a-familys-anguish-for-melbourne-grandmother-lost-to-covid-in-aged-care
2/18/2022,"Thousands of nursing and disability care students across Australia are being prevented from completing clinical placements required to graduate due to pandemic restrictions and the furloughing of senior staff who supervise them. With a severe shortage of healthcare workers, the Australian Primary Health Care Nurses Association (APNA) said if the issue was not urgently addressed, an increasing backlog of nursing students will mean there are not enough trained nurses to staff aged care homes, general practices, and other settings.  This comes at a time when the healthcare system as a whole, and nursing staff in particular, are already under unprecedented strain after working through two years of the Covid pandemic. On Tuesday, thousands of nurses across NSW went on strike, protesting low pay and “unsustainable” working conditions. A student completing her diploma of nursing through Tafe in Victoria told Guardian Australia she began studying her certificates in ageing support and disability in April 2019, and should have finished courses in May 2020. “As Covid hit, almost all of the facilities in aged care, disability and home and community care shut their doors to students as part of infection control, but under the requirements of the certificate to successfully gain the qualification, students are required to undertake 120 hours of placement,” she said. “The training organisation I was with struggled to get any students in my classes the placement hours, and as a result I still have not got my certificate in ageing support.” She then applied for a diploma of nursing but has encountered the same issue. She should be close to completing her course, but has still not completed the placement hours required. “Tafe Victoria has a special team dedicated to sourcing placement, but we are continuously told there is a serious backlog of students and there are limited placements available,” the student said. “On some occasions, I had a placement booked in, however they were cancelled due to a positive Covid-19 case at the facility. One of the other frustrating things with placement is that training organisations only have placement partnerships with selected hospitals. “Many of us are not able to receive our qualification. I felt such huge anger and frustration that the defence force has been asked to help out in aged care and is allowed in, yet someone like myself with training can’t. It absolutely makes no sense. “My qualifications that I have been working hard to gain are not worth anything and I feel I have just wasted all this time.” The president of APNA, Karen Booth, said “thousands” of nursing students were facing similar issues. APNA has been working with universities and tertiary institutions to provide nursing placements for undergraduate and postgraduate students in aged care homes and other facilities to reduce reliance on hospitals. But Booth said more support is needed to expand the program and coordinate it nationally. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Our primary healthcare nurses desperately need help, and nursing students – many thousands of whom find themselves unable to get the clinical placement experience they need – are a ready-made solution,” she said. “Nursing students can be utilised in primary healthcare to triage patients, help with health checks, and help registered nurses with vaccine clinics and other clinical activities. “More importantly, supervised student nurses, using approved scripted checklists, could do welfare calls to people at home who are sick with Covid, and escalate treatment to registered nurses or general practitioners as needed.” A spokesperson from the federal department of health said the government had sought to address health workforce issues by establishing the “Aged Care Workforce Rapid Response Initiative” in December, a pilot program aimed at connecting students undertaking a Certificate III in Individual Support (Ageing) that require work placements with residential aged care providers who urgently need staff. Providers are expected to pay students while they undertake their placement. The spokesperson did not say how many students had found industry placement through the program. A spokesperson for the Department of Education, Skills and Employmentsaid that it is ultimately up to individual healthcare providers, and any state or territory public health orders, to determine student access to facilities and the appropriateness of work placements. “The commonwealth’s training regulator, ASQA, has noted there is flexibility for training providers to bring forward theoretical training and use simulated workplace environments where clinical placements have been disrupted,” he said. “The Australian government strongly encourages healthcare providers and registered training organisations to assist students wherever possible to make work placements available.”",News/Australia news,Australian nursing students struggle to complete training due to Covid restrictions,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/18/australian-nursing-students-struggle-to-complete-training-due-to-covid-restrictions
2/18/2022,"Unlike the unending and tedious debate over who is the best Bond, there is no argument when it comes to the best Hannibal Lecter: it is Mads Mikkelsen. Anthony Hopkins’s overripe performance remains firm in the minds of many, but Mikkelsen is truly brilliant in Bryan Fuller’s strange and excellent show, having had the luxury of 36 hours of telly to transform Hannibal the Cannibal into something beyond a bogeyman. In fact, it takes a while for Hannibal’s toothy side to truly come out in the TV adaptation, which aired between 2013 and 2015. Here, he is a serial killer successfully disguised as a harmless and prissy European oddball, and regarded as a respected psychiatrist in Baltimore. Fuller chooses to focus equally on the cat to his mouse – or the mouse to his cat – Will Graham (played by Hugh Dancy), a prickly and vulnerable profiler tasked by the FBI to help them hunt murderers. Despite being too “unstable” to work as an official agent, Graham is uniquely talented at his gruesome work, so Hannibal is discretely hired by FBI big cheese Jack Crawford (Laurence Fishburne) to keep an eye on his mental health while he does his extremely traumatising day job.  Like Bond, most people know Hannibal by mononym alone; we all know about his unique palate going in, but everyone around him (most of whom have attended one of his dinner parties) does not. “Before we begin, you must all be warned – nothing here is vegetarian,” Hannibal announces at the beginning of a dinner, with great aplomb; the fun comes from knowing that meat is the least of his guests’ worries. The suspense instead comes from the episodic murders Graham is tasked with solving, and his slow realisation that there is more to his psychiatrist than meets the eye. As he tells a doubtful Crawford: “You and I probably sipped wine while swallowing the people who we were trying to give justice, Jack.” Much like Fuller’s other shows Pushing Daisies and American Gods, Hannibal has a heightened aesthetic, dialled up to ridiculous. Everything is rich: the colours, the foods, the clothing, the sounds. It all looks lush, while also being unsettling: Hannibal’s dining room, as an example, is often decorated with pomegranates and porcupine quills, inserted by the show’s food stylist to trigger a sense of danger and trypophobia. All this muchness – under a cacophonous soundtrack from composer Brian Reitzell, mashing up everything from theremins to gamelan – leaves you feeling, just like Will Graham, that you may be losing your mind. Much like the show’s aesthetic, Mikkelsen’s angular face veers between freaky and beautiful depending on the shot. Hannibal’s unnerving blankness could be mistaken for an absence of acting, but that’s not it at all: if you’ve seen the Danish actor in Another Round or The Hunt, you know he’s remarkable. On each of the three times I’ve watched the series, I have noticed more subtle details of his performance; the film that develops over Hannibal’s shark-like eyes when he is being careful, the furious twitch of a little finger betraying his great anger, the hint of a delighted smile at Will. It may be apocryphal that Mikkelsen, who has since starred in every Hollywood franchise going, learned much of his English skills from reading Hannibal scripts. Either way, he’s as good here as he is in most things, and clearly having a helluva time, delivering lines like “You tried to kill me, Will – it is hard not to take that personally” with amusing restraint. Hannibal is Dancy’s show too. Up until now, he has mostly been wasted in forgettable romcoms or playing pretty toffs in costume dramas; as Graham, he is snarky, wounded and utterly compelling. Mikkelsen and Dancy share a uniquely charged chemistry and thankfully the show doesn’t ignore it (despite being made by a major American network that, at one point, asked for more blood to be added to a murder scene to cover a butt crack). Hannibal leans into the homoeroticism of a story about a man killing an incredible number of people just to make another man understand him more. “Is Hannibal in love with me?” Graham asks in one episode; by then, both he and you know the answer. On occasion the show can be hammier than anything Hannibal is cooking, but that’s part of the joy. After all, Hannibal the Cannibal is a inherently ridiculous creation – it would be weirder to make a po-faced series about a snobby serial killer who gleefully dances around the FBI and enjoys a bit of heart tartare. Instead, we get moments like Hannibal serving a man his own leg, candied and studded with sugar cane skewers. A totem pole made of dead bodies, anyone? How about a council worker used as a trellis for a tree, his tasty organs replaced with flowers? Really, it’s a wonder Hannibal made it to three seasons: it was weird, it was gross, it was very queer. But we must savour that it got to exist at all.",Arts/Culture,"Disgusting, camp, beautiful: Bryan Fuller’s Hannibal is an overlooked gem",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/18/disgusting-camp-beautiful-bryan-fullers-hannibal-is-an-overlooked-gem
2/18/2022,"When Midnight Oil announced their final tour last November – a once-more-with-feeling run of dates around the country to support their 13th studio album, Resist – founding guitarist Jim Moginie was typically met with three responses. The first was a scoff of disbelief, usually with a reference to John Farnham’s never-ending farewell shows. The second, more humorous, was that the group should have quit while they were ahead in 1981 – “and that was from some of my friends,” Moginie says.  But the third response was a shrug of acceptance. Moginie, 66 in May, is the youngest surviving member of the band; the eldest, singer Peter Garrett, is 69 in April. There will be no long goodbyes. “We’re more like Johnny Rotten [than Johnny Farnham] — we mean it, man!” Garrett says, invoking a line from the Sex Pistols’ anthem God Save The Queen. In their early years, tour handbills promised “The Oils are coming”. Now, 50 years after their rough beginnings, they’re leaving – the stage at least. More than any other band, Midnight Oil have remained part of Australia’s cultural conversation. Their breakthrough classic from 1982, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 – with its indelible hits Power and the Passion and US Forces – spent 177 consecutive weeks on the Australian charts. It opened the doors to a global audience. Their 1986 album, Diesel and Dust, preceded by a tour through remote Indigenous communities, sold 4m copies worldwide. Its opening track, the land rights anthem Beds Are Burning, is listed in the US Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as one of 500 songs that shaped the form. But it was in the live arena where Midnight Oil built their reputation, not just for galvanising shows, but headline-grabbing protest actions: stopping Manhattan traffic with a gig outside the Exxon building in 1990; playing to a global audience of billions at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games in “Sorry” suits, campaigning for a government apology to the stolen generations. After a long hiatus caused by Garrett’s pursuit of a second career in federal politics, the band’s resumption for the Great Circle tour in 2017 saw them play across 16 countries to an audience of half a million. They remained a visceral experience, where the extreme physicality of the performances (including Garrett’s unique dance step) was an extension of the sharp angles and energy of the music. To continue, he says, would be testing not only fate but the band’s reputation. For Garrett, it is a relatively easy call. “Only a fool would go on believing that they can bring the same level of effort to it – when they were born in 1953 – as they did 25 years ago,” he says. Moginie won’t name them, but he shudders at the memory of some older groups he’s seen. “You don’t want to be up there, playing the song you did 40 years ago, and everyone’s heading for the hotdog stands,” he says. Hovering over the conversation is the ghost of Bones Hillman, Midnight Oil’s bass player since 1987. Hillman died on 7 November 2020, one week after the release of the Makarrata Project, the band’s first album for nearly two decades and the first to go to No 1 since Blue Sky Mining in 1990. Hillman was the youngest member of Midnight Oil, and therefore in theory “the least likely to be leaving first”, according to Garrett, whose grief at the loss of his bandmate is still palpably raw. But Hillman, who hid his illness from the band, was a road hog. “He never saw a leaf of lettuce he didn’t run a mile from, he never met a beer or hamburger he didn’t fall in love with, and he smoked right through to the end,” Garrett says. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Garrett tends to the view that even if Hillman were still alive, the band would have come to the same decision to retire from touring. But for Moginie, his death was “right at the heart of it”. When he listens back to Resist and The Makarrata Project – both recorded in a six-week recording session in late 2019, with Resist’s release shelved for more than a year due to the pandemic – it’s Hillman that dominates. “All I can hear now when I hear it is him – his playing, his sweet voice, his driving bass,” Moginie says. “It’s funny. We’re all very co-dependent; I can’t remember a time when he wasn’t in the band, even though we had two bass players before him.” On stage, Hillman has been replaced by Adam Ventoura, who has a more rugged edge to his playing, reminiscent of Hillman’s predecessor Peter Gifford. To compensate for the loss of Hillman’s harmony vocals, the band recruited singers Liz Stringer and Leah Flanagan. Their presence softens the band slightly, and is in keeping with the sound of Resist, which leans into the folk-rock tradition of protest singing. A few songs summon some of their old crunch, but mostly this is a kinder, gentler, more sombre Midnight Oil. Nearly a decade after he left behind a second career in politics, including various stints as environment, arts and education minister in the Rudd and Gillard governments, Garrett confesses he has struggled to hold on to his natural optimism. Resist’s cover art is styled like a temperature graph; most of the songs deal with the climate emergency and environmental collapse. The new single, At the Time Of Writing, damns what Garrett labels “inconsequential leadership, the lack of serious adults in the room”. “I still retain my optimism underneath, and I firmly accept that within the time zone of the decade or so [we have left] to hold warming to tolerable levels, that we won’t necessarily end up consigning our successors to an absolute living inferno,” he says. “But there’s every chance we will, if we don’t get on with things and get serious about change, and that’s a very sobering thought for someone who’s got kids – I haven’t got grandkids, but the others have.” And while careful to keep the band’s frustration at being unable to perform in perspective of the human catastrophe of the pandemic, Garrett reserves special venom for the abandonment of the live music sector. “The pandemic showed once and for all that the political classes neither understand nor have a great deal of empathy for the performance industry and the arts in general, even though eventually some money was wheedled out of them,” he says. “How is it that we were visibly discriminated against, while the Barmy Army could slobber over one another together, drinking beer and rubbing their tummies together [at the cricket]? It wasn’t lost on any performers, and hopefully it wasn’t lost on our audiences that we were at the very bottom of the pecking order.” The band is adamant that they will continue in some form, that they have only retired from live performance. Moginie, always the studio boffin of the band, jokes that they may yet write their version of Sgt Pepper – before clarifying it’s his least favourite Beatles album. “I don’t think we’re going to be sad about it at all. I don’t think we’ll all be in tears hugging each other on stage, although that might happen. But I know we’ll all be doing stuff together, it’s just what we do,” Moginie says. But it will be different. “This is a band of musicians and writers and performers who will all continue to do that in different guises, so long as we can breathe a breath,” Garrett says. “What shape and form that takes, that’s anybody’s guess.”  Resist by Midnight Oil is out now. Midnight Oil’s farewell tour runs until May, taking in city centres and regions around Australia and New Zealand",Arts/Music,"Midnight Oil on Resist and their last ever tour: ‘We mean it, man!’",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/18/midnight-oil-on-resist-and-their-last-ever-tour-we-mean-it-man
2/18/2022,"The pandemic has been a destroyer of worlds. Now we have started emerging from our foxholes, taking account of the damage and cleaning things up. A lot has been written in the last few weeks on the toll the pandemic has taken on our friendships. In what’s also been called the great pandemic friendship reckoning, post lockdowns people have clocked the asymmetry of certain friendships (“you weren’t checking in on me, and I was always checking in on you”, etc) or that some friendships have become stale and catching up doesn’t fill you with joy, or things have changed and you have changed. No one is the same person they were two years ago.  Right now, a certain emotional Marie Kondo-ing is going on – and it can feel painful. Throw out enough friendships in this process and it may feel as if there’s not many people left. The pandemic also destroyed weak ties – the friendships, acquaintances and pleasant interactions that occurred as a byproduct of our daily lives. It might have been the barista you saw every day, or the security guard you talked to several times a day at your office, or the other parents at the school gate. It’s also our colleagues – people we don’t select to spend time with but often end up physically with for longer periods than our families. Or we did, before. While it can feel like some old friendships are disintegrating before our eyes, now is the time to rebuild the weak ties in our lives. A weak tie won’t replace your childhood best friend, but strong weak ties can improve wellbeing and a sense of being connected with wider communities. Stanford professor Mark Granovetter explored the strength of weak ties in a groundbreaking sociology paper in 1973. Granovetter found that acquaintances were more likely to tell you about opportunities in work or life, because everyone in your close pool of friends and family has access to the same information. A weak tie brings in news and connections from further afield, introduces you to people that you might one day marry or hear about a job from. Weak ties expand our social networks but they also make us feel connected to a broader world. Many of us are now in the early stages of the process of reconnecting with entire areas of our lives that have lain dormant for two years. This also includes reconnecting with colleagues. Colleagues is a bland, functional word, but the term can be elastic enough to cover people we’d get a coffee for, people we’d take a bullet for, and people we were happy to have a break from for two years. Colleagues are not really celebrated much in the annals of friendship – but God, I’ve really missed mine. Being with colleagues in real time makes work better – not just the experience of work, but the actual material product of your work is usually always better with face-to-face collaboration. A great colleague can develop into a great friendship, and in the last two years many of us haven’t had that important relationship in our lives. As anyone knows who has tried to do Friday night knock-off drinks on Zoom, your colleagues online are not the same as your colleagues in the pub or the break room. There’s no connective tissue in the relationship any more, the encounter feels as flat as the screen. Banter, office gossip, the serendipity of a conversation with someone from another team in the elevator or the cross-pollination of ideas that leads to something great or fun has been missing for two years now – and although we have been productive working from home, a definite spark is gone. In How’s Work, a podcast by Esther Perel on the workplace, the psychologist did an episode on a newsroom that worked remotely. It was unexpectedly sad and moving. These journalists were covering the biggest story of their lives from their bedrooms and were not getting the support from each other that is so necessary to process and execute aspects of the job. Said one journalist, “Such a big part of being a journalist are those moments of walking across the newsroom and sparking conversations … The collaboration is so much harder to do when we’re so far away.” Now some are returning to the office. Adjusting will take a while. The great pandemic friendship reckoning is chewing through the social landscape, and workplaces are no different. Many of these previously vibrant work friendships are on ice. Or people have left (without a leaving do, without ceremony, a card, or … anything). New people have started – in fact they started so long ago they are no longer new. But all this is also exciting. It feels like renewal. Our weak ties are waiting for us – all we have to do is connect.",Opinion/Opinion,Colleagues aren’t celebrated much in the annals of friendship – but I’ve really missed mine | Brigid Delaney,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/18/colleagues-arent-celebrated-much-in-the-annals-of-friendship-but-ive-really-missed-mine
2/18/2022,"One of Australia’s most respected former public servants, Dennis Richardson, has accused Liberal senator James Paterson of engaging in a “grubby” and “despicable” attempt to blacken his name over comments Paterson made in an interview on Sky News. Paterson, the chair of federal parliament’s powerful committee on intelligence and security, argued in the interview on Thursday that Richardson, the former head of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, had publicly advocated in 2018 that the Chinese telco Huawei should be involved in the Australian 5G rollout.  Paterson described Richardson as a “distinguished” former public servant. But the Liberal senator told Sky News the government’s decision to exclude Huawei from the 5G rollout was “one of the best decisions our government has made – and I stand by it even if Dennis Richardson disagrees”. Paterson’s critique followed Richardson contending in a series of interviews on Thursday morning that the Morrison government was serving China’s interests, not Australia’s, by politicising national security ahead of the election, and “seeking to create the perception of a difference [between the major parties] when none in practice exists”. The unusual intervention carried weight. During his long career in the public sector, Richardson was secretary of the departments of foreign affairs and defence, as well as the Asio boss, and Australia’s ambassador to Washington. The latter two appointments occurred during the Howard government. Richardson told Guardian Australia back when he was the secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the government considered whether or not Huawei would be involved in the 4G network. “I was on the secretaries committee on national security which recommended against Huawei’s involvement in 4G,” the retired bureaucrat said. “I was not in government in 2018. And I challenge James Paterson to come up with any evidence that I advocated for Huawei’s unmitigated involvement in 5G. “Given that I was on the secretaries committee on national security that recommended against Huawei being involved in 4G, on what basis I would have advocated for Huawei being in 5G is beyond me.” Richardson said he had made a comment in the media that the United Kingdom “had negotiated a deal with Huawei that enabled them to be in part involved in non-sensitive areas”. “However the Brits subsequently overturned that. So James Paterson is being loose with the truth by a long margin. He ought to check his facts and get them right before he makes public comments about individuals.” It was reported at the time that Richardson suggested that Australia should follow the UK’s lead and establish a cyber-security unit to manage risks and safeguard Australia’s national interest, rather than banning the Chinese company outright. On Sky News on Thursday, Paterson also noted that it had been publicly reported that in 2011, when Richardson was secretary of Dfat, he went on leave “to negotiate on behalf of the Canberra Raiders a lucrative sponsorship agreement from Huawei for the Canberra Raiders”. Richardson rejected that. He said he was involved in one presentation at board level, and took half a day’s leave without pay to attend that event, but: “I never negotiated with Huawei their sponsorship of the Canberra raiders. “That is a claim that was put in a letter to the editor in the Canberra Times a couple of years ago which I refuted. Indeed, it was stated in the Canberra Times that I’d taken six weeks leave to negotiate this deal with Huawei, and as I pointed out in my response, I have never taken six weeks leave in my life, let alone taking six weeks leave to negotiate a deal with Huawei.” Richardson said the history recounted by Paterson was selective. “At the time we got that sponsorship from Huawei, no-one other than [former Liberal foreign affairs minister] Alexander Downer was on the board of Huawei – right?” “Alexander Downer was on the board of Huawei, and might I also add that in 2011, when I went to Senate estimates and was questioned by none other than the good senator [Eric] Abetz, who asked me about whether I had done this and that about Huawei, I told him what I’d done, and I said if you think I’ve done anything wrong, go to the public service board, go to the police, go to whomever you like. “He never pursued it. I subsequently deliberately accepted an invitation from Huawei to go to a match of the state of origin in Sydney.” Richardson said other guests of Huawei at that match included a federal liberal staffer and a senior Liberal from the NSW party. “If they want to cast aspersions, then bring it on. It is grubby and it is an attempt to blacken people’s names. “It is despicable for them to want to engage in this sort of innuendo. The first thing they should do is get their facts right – that would help. To say that I advocated for Huawei’s involvement in 5G in 2018 is not even half true. It is extraordinarily misleading and it flies in the face of what happened in 2011.” The escalating brawl between Liberal politicians and members of the national security establishment follows days of intensifying partisan contention over national security. Scott Morrison and Peter Dutton have spent much of the parliamentary week declaring that China wants the Labor party to win the looming federal election. The hyper-partisanship culminated in Morrison on Wednesday branding Labor’s deputy leader, Richard Marles, a “Manchurian candidate” – an observation he later withdrew. The phrase “Manchurian candidate” refers to a politician being used as a puppet by an enemy power. On Wednesday night, the current Asio chief Mike Burgess also declared the weaponisation of national security was “not helpful to us”. Paterson said on Thursday Burgess’s comments had been “over-interpreted”. The Labor leader Anthony Albanese returned fire on Thursday seizing on comments made by Richardson to the ABC. “What is unusual in this case is that the government is seeking to create the perception of a difference between it and the opposition on a critical national security issue, that is China – seeking to create the perception of a difference when none in practise exists,” Richardson had told the ABC. “That’s not in the national interest. That only serves the interests of one country, and that is China.” Albanese used Richardson’s criticism of the politicisation to turn Morrison’s insult back on him. Gesturing in Morrison’s direction in the chamber, Albanese declared after question time: “If you are looking for a Manchurian candidate, he sits over there.”",News/Australia news,Former Asio boss accuses Liberal senator of ‘grubby’ attack over Huawei comments ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/18/former-asio-boss-accuses-liberal-senator-of-grubby-attack-over-huawei-comments
2/18/2022,"Angus Taylor was refreshingly upfront on Thursday about the extent to which he was sidelined from a major decision affecting the future of Australia’s electricity grid. Speaking to Ray Hadley on Sydney’s 2GB, the federal energy minister said he did not find out about Origin Energy’s decision to shut Australia’s biggest electricity generator, the Eraring coal-fired power plant, seven years earlier than scheduled until the night before.  “To find out last night with no warning … I’ve got to tell you, it’s very disappointing,” Taylor said. His New South Wales Liberal counterpart, Matt Kean, also expressed disappointment in Origin’s decision to close the Lake Macquarie plant from 2025, but not shock. He and the company’s chief executive, Frank Calabria, said dialogue between the state government and Origin started months ago. The first contact from the company was in July, and the company requested it be kept confidential. Which, among other things, meant the federal government wasn’t to be told. Origin says there is nothing in this – that the NSW government was the relevant jurisdiction for it to talk with – but it’s no secret that major energy industry players are frustrated with what many see as the federal government’s obstructive and scolding approach to dealing with the historic change under way in how electricity is generated and transmitted. It’s also no secret that Kean and Taylor don’t see eye-to-eye on the best way ahead on electricity. Where the NSW minister talks up the need to act on the climate crisis and promises the country’s biggest renewable energy expansion under legislation passed with cross-party support, Taylor says little about the damage from rising greenhouse gas emissions and mostly emphasises the risks of price spikes and reliability issues in moving away from fossil fuels. It’s important to note those risks are real. No one should assume the shift to a grid that runs overwhelmingly on renewable energy will be straightforward. But emphasis matters, and plenty of experts – from the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) down – say the transformation is manageable. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Taylor’s admission he was kept out of the loop on one of biggest decision affecting the electricity grid in recent times suggests Origin learned from the experience of others, particularly AGL. Those lessons include that to be open with the federal government that you plan to shut a coal plant early is to invite pressure to keep it running. The Morrison government’s approach to energy remains piecemeal and inconsistent. It includes building publicly owned hydro and gas plants that discourage private investment while maintaining it is the industry’s responsibility to provide the generation needed. There is no national policy to guide when ageing coal plants should close, or to support coal communities that face inevitable disruption. Instead, some politicians continue to play out a strange pantomime, pretending the country’s official schedule of coal-plant closure dates – which would see many running well into the 2030s, and some the 2040s – remains a meaningful document. In reality, it is widely accepted that many could shut much earlier. Why? The rise of solar has rapidly made coal plants unviable as the around-the-clock generators they were meant to be. They can’t compete with an influx of free solar energy in the middle of the day, and were mostly not built to ramp down and then back up when needed. This was the point Calabria was making when he said “rapidly changing conditions in the national electricity market” are “increasingly not well suited to traditional baseload power stations”. Coal still provides about 60% of generation in the grid and is crucial for its operation, but renewables are coming fast: from about 20% three years ago to more than 31% last year, and 35% in the December quarter. That should reach 69% by the end of the decade, according to federal government projections. Labor, meanwhile, has a $20bn pledge to bring forward the construction of transmission infrastructure to connect new renewable energy zones. Modelling for the ALP suggests the country could hit 83% renewable energy by 2030 if it wins the upcoming election. How many coal plants does that leave room for? The role of supporting cheap variable solar and wind is expected to increasingly be played by things better suited to filling the gaps. They include batteries, pumped hydro schemes, stronger transmission connections, demand management programs and, at least for a while, gas-fired plants. Aemo laid this out in its draft integrated system plan – a blueprint for an optimal grid – in December, when it suggested the step change under way meant coal plants were likely to shut at almost triple the pace officially acknowledged, and estimated the new generation needed to meet future demand. It is not the only view of the future, but nothing in the weeks since has challenged its view that coal is rapidly headed for the door. Two energy giants – AGL last week, and now Origin – have brought forward coal plant official closure dates and renewables have pushed black coal generation to its lowest levels in 23 years. Eraring is particularly in the gun. As Dylann McConnell, a University of Melbourne energy analyst, points out, it is generally the most expensive coal generator in the grid and its output has fallen more rapidly than the rest of the fleet. It is the sort of decline that might grab a federal energy minister’s attention whether directly informed or not. There are two immediate questions that flow from the announcement of Eraring’s exit. The first is whether the NSW government’s response is up to the task. On support for the plant’s 400 workers and the community that relies, it’s too early to say. Both the company and the state government have promised packages, with details to come. On electricity supply, Kean announced the creation of a “transmission acceleration facility” charged with hurrying up the investment being driven by the electricity infrastructure roadmap that passed state parliament in 2020. Its first mission is building a 700MW “Waratah super battery” with a proposed storage capacity of 1400 megawatt hours. Taylor told Hadley it was “delusional” to think a battery could replace a 2880MW coal plant, but Kean said that was not its role – that it would be designed to fix constraints in getting existing generation to Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong, not provide energy itself. There was also $84m to bring forward other infrastructure and nearly $50m for pumped hydro projects. Is it enough? It’s early days and some analysts have expressed concern, but Aemo was quick to make its position clear: the state would have access to enough electricity to ensure its energy security target – set to ensure the lights stay on even in disastrous circumstances – could still be met once Eraring is gone. Which is good news – and brings us to the second question. When should we expect the next announcement that a coal plant is closing early? It would be unwise to bet it will take long.",News/Environment,"On coal plant closures, the energy industry has learned to keep Angus Taylor out of the loop",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/18/on-coal-plant-closures-the-energy-industry-has-learned-to-keep-angus-taylor-out-of-the-loop
2/18/2022,"Australians wanting to catch up on ABC television shows will soon need to create a free account and login to watch programs on its streaming platform iView. On Thursday, the public broadcaster said iView users would need to set up a free account to use the service from March. In a statement, the ABC explained requiring an account, which has until now been voluntary, would “increase user experiences through features including program recommendations, watchlists and the ability to pick up a show where they left off”.  The move has prompted a mixed reaction, with some viewers questioning why they have to sign up for a service that Australians pay for with their taxes or raising privacy concerns, while others have welcomed the extra convenience that comes with it. The ABC said the move would bring it into line with other streaming services, commercial and public, to offer users a tailored viewing experience. “Requiring a login on ABC iView, with all the privacy and data protections people expect of the ABC, enables the commercial-free public broadcaster to continue to nurture its relationship with audiences,” it said. “Nothing about creating a login for ABC iView changes our editorial independence, integrity or responsibility, including the privacy and data protections people expect of the ABC.” The president of ABC Friends, Margaret Reynolds, said the decision had concerned some members who were annoyed at having to sign up, while others had embraced the changes. “It’s a typical clash of new and old,” Reynolds said. “We’re managing new technology with logins and passwords for everything from your phone bill to Netflix. “I think many people would think, ‘what are they complaining about?’ but other people, like me, say if I have to have another password I’ll need a separate room just to keep them in.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Lauren Rosewarne, an associate professor from the University of Melbourne, said that logins were used to track user consumption patterns and their interaction with ABC advertisements online. “Some viewers will see it as a breach of their privacy and believe that something that they fund – as taxpayers – should be able to be consumed unrestricted,” Rosewarne said. “Others, however, actually get benefit from having an account: they can return to a program wherever they last left off, and programs will be suggested to them based on their viewing habits – some viewers see these things as positive.” She said for other people who regularly use streaming services, either commercial or public, the move won’t be seen as “egregious”. “It’s important to recognise generational differences in perceptions and concerns around privacy,” she said. “A generation who has known no world prior to having an infinite number of digital accounts will likely find having to have an iView account as less of an imposition than those who have spent comparatively less time online and guard their privacy with more vigilance.” The ABC has sought to allay concerns over privacy, saying that it put “a high priority on the protection of personal information”. “The ABC will never sell the data, creating an account is free, and there is no paid advertising on ABC platforms in Australia,” it said. But CEO of Thinking Cybersecurity and associate professor at ANU, Vanessa Teague, said the ABC can still legally provide Google and Facebook with a hashed version of someone’s email – a unique code used to cover the actual email. “The ABC has said they will not be conveying viewing habits (to big tech),” Teague said. “But you don’t need to convey that I have a habit of watching cooking shows. You can say ‘it would be advantageous to show me an ad for cooking shows’ and that’s useful information very slightly wrapped up in one layer of separation, so it doesn’t seem to be conveying viewing habits.” She said the privacy policies in place stop them from using raw data, but won’t stop them from building a profile of users if they click on the ads targeted towards them. “They are at the very least linking info about people and what they are interested in watching,” she said. “They should make it an option to opt-in. I don’t think there’s any excuse for putting up that barrier in front of content that is publicly owned. It’s owned content, it belongs to us. “Sticking up arbitrary barriers is inexcusable,” Teague said.",News/Media,ABC to require user accounts for iView streaming platform from March,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/18/abc-to-require-user-accounts-for-iview-streaming-platform-from-march
2/18/2022,"Taxpayer-funded ads exaggerated the federal government’s role in infrastructure projects, while a plan to include former deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, had to be scrapped for breaching advice, an auditor general’s report has revealed. The Australian National Audit Office made those findings in a report, released on Thursday, identifying “shortcomings” in the Building Our Future campaign, including material that was not always presented in an “objective and fair manner”.  The audit examined the framework of government advertising, which is once again ballooning in advance of the 2022 election, and three campaigns conducted since 2019. Government advertising is subject to strict guidelines against party political material, but is often criticised for boosting messages favourable to the incumbent. The ANAO found the infrastructure department’s handling of the $34.6m Building Our Future campaign was “largely effective” although it showed some “shortcomings” in compliance. The audit found while advertising materials were free of political content, public relations materials were “not consistent” with advice to the finance department that “activities would not ‘be instigated by any political party or politician, or make reference to any political party or politician’”. In fact, the PR campaign included a movie roadshow attended by Coalition MPs and senators, which the department proposed would include a pre-recorded introduction from McCormack, who was the infrastructure minister and deputy prime minister at the time. The finance department advised that McCormack’s inclusion in the material was “problematic” and it could not support the proposal, which resulted in the pre-recorded message being scrapped. “Campaign materials were not always presented in an objective and fair manner, with some campaign statements not accurately representing the Australian government’s level of involvement in some projects featured in advertising materials,” the ANAO said. The ANAO cited advertising materials with “no reference” to a state or territory partner in projects such as the Brisbane Metro, for which the federal government gave just one quarter of the funds, or the Victoria M80 Ring Road and Nowra Bridge, which it contributed half. The department claimed that acknowledgment of partners was “removed during the refinement stage to allow enough space for campaign messaging/creative elements and to ensure the best possible message cut-through”. The website that press and radio ads pointed to did make clear when projects were funded by partners, it said. In other instances the ads stated “Australian Government is upgrading” the M80 and M1 Pacific motorway, while partnership with state governments was reduced to one reference under the logo. The claim the federal government “is building” the North East Link was downgraded to “is investing” in the project. The ANAO found the department also prepared toolkits for MPs and senators to promote infrastructure projects, the recipients of which were selected through a “political mapping exercise”. “It is unclear how the MPs and senators who were to receive a toolkit were to be selected and infrastructure was unable to provide a list of intended recipients,” it said. The department told the ANAO the toolkits “were not distributed due to the election being called and the caretaker period commencing”, although the campaign ended on 13 April 2019, just two days after the election was called on 11 April. “Infrastructure did not undertake an assessment of whether the wave 1 public relations activities were compliant with the guidelines,” it said. The ANAO also criticised the department for lacking a “long-term communications strategy for the infrastructure investment pipeline or targets for performance against the campaign objectives”. Infrastructure did not set clear targets for awareness of the projects and benefits of transport infrastructure, the ANAO found. Research in 2020 found there was “limited lasting increases in awareness of the pipeline after the first two waves” with “only slight improvements in awareness over time”. The ANAO recommended the department “assess whether continuing a campaign represents proper use of taxpayer resources and document the reasons for continuing the campaign”, which it agreed to do. In its response infrastructure department acknowledged “that there are learnings to be made from past campaign administration to ensure communications adhere more strongly to the guidelines”. The ANAO also examined Treasury’s Economic Recovery Plan campaign, which ran from October to December 2020 and then was scheduled to run again from June to October 2021, but “was paused on 1 July 2021 due to Covid-19 lockdown restrictions” during the Delta wave. The ANAO found this campaign was presented in an “objective, fair and accessible manner” but generated “no increases in overall public or business awareness or understanding” on the economic recovery from Covid. The domestic violence support Help Is Here campaign met guidelines, but the department of social services “did not clearly document the justification for an additional burst of advertising” in the 2020-21 holiday period, the ANAO said.",News/Australia news,"Coalition’s taxpayer-funded ads over played role in state infrastructure projects, auditor finds",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/18/coalitions-taxpayer-funded-ads-over-played-role-in-state-infrastructure-projects-auditor-finds
2/18/2022,"A friend who I thought was a close friend has been unsupportive following the recent death of my father. We have been friends for 15 years and while we don’t live in each other’s pockets, we are close friends, who confide in each other. I was the bridesmaid at her wedding. When my father died recently, while she did call to commiserate and send a kind text about him, she did not make the effort to come to the funeral (it is a two-hour drive away) unlike my other close friends. While I can forgive that, what I am struggling with is that almost two weeks later she has not contacted me to see how I am doing or whether I was OK after the funeral. My father died close to Christmas, and all my friends except her texted me to say they were thinking of me, which I really appreciated.  I don’t expect my friends to get me through my grief, I know everyone has their own life demands, but I would have expected my close friend to be more supportive. My mother and sister think I should cut her some slack as she is a good friend in other ways. I just don’t know how I can pretend that things are the same with her when I see her again. Please don’t say have a conversation with her, as conversations of that kind always affect a friendship anyway. Is there a way I can have a more superficial friendship with her? Eleanor says: You’re right that Serious Conversations always affect a relationship, so I won’t just say “communicate”. I will say this isn’t a failure unique to her. Many close relationships struggle after a bereavement, each side of finding the other impossible to reach. One explanation is the one that you gave: death reveals that you’re not as close as you thought. Another is that people just don’t know what to say to someone bereaved. Really, literally, they don’t know what to say – people who are otherwise loving and perspicacious can get totally dumbstruck in the presence of grief. I think it’s because death is so unflinchingly permanent. Nothing we can say will take it away, and it’s hard to know how to help other people when we can’t take away the source of their pain. So many people just retreat; at least that way they didn’t fail. A lot of people have found themselves standing where you do now – bereaved and wondering why their friend doesn’t call – while the friend is wondering how it would possibly help if they did. So the explanation for your friend’s behaviour might not be that she doesn’t grasp the enormity of losing your dad. It might be precisely because she understands it that something inside her has decided to run. Of course, it’s only so useful to you to know why she’s done this. Maybe she’s felt paralysed in the way that I’ve described – or maybe she’s just being callous – either way she didn’t show up, and that sucks. That’s a fact, no matter what explains it. But if, as you write, you want to have an ongoing relationship with this friend, you’re going to need a way to forgive her. No relationship can survive the slow simmer of resentment, least of all one that’s trending into superficiality. If you want to keep her in your life without smarting every time you see her, it might help to interpret her actions here in the more generous way. That interpretation might not be true – but on the other hand, it might be, and sometimes that possibility is enough for us to forgive when we’ve been hurt. Another thing you might try is to initiate some of the interactions you might have had if she’d stepped up when she should have. If she had called, for instance, you might have talked to your friend about your dad – often after we lose someone it’s nice to talk about them, instead of the fact that they’re gone. So you could initiate that the next time you see her; not with any nod to her absence on the topic, just, “Can I talk about my dad for a bit?” Perhaps you can just use the chance to tell her who he was, what you shared, why you’ll miss him. That’s something she can listen to without feeling compelled to fix anything, and it might give your relationship the sense that your bereavement has been heard. Friends fail us – surprisingly often, especially with grief. If we want to stay friends, it helps to focus on what’s next. Do you have a conflict, crossroads or dilemma you need help with?

2/18/2022,"Teachers unions are calling on the New South Wales state government to extend the supply of rapid antigen tests for staff and students, saying the program has helped to curb Covid-19 transmission in classrooms. Despite Victoria on Thursday announcing its near-identical school plan would be extended until the end of the term, the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, indicated his state was still working through details.  More than 12,000 NSW students tested positive using rapid tests in the second week of school, an increase of nearly 50% on the 8,100 students who tested positive in week one. A further 521 staff also tested positive in NSW schools during the second week of term. Victoria has recorded infections for 18,825 students and 1,934 teachers since the start of the term, and the state’s education minister, James Merlino, said modelling from the Burnet Institute showed rapid testing had prevented 21,000 further cases. The Victorian government will provide 24m rapid antigen tests to schools and early childhood education centres in addition to 15.6m tests already provided. “[The] modelling shows that will prevent a further 61,000 cases in students and 150,000 cases in the community,” Merlino said on Thursday. In NSW, Perrottet announced that indoor mask mandates would be dropped for most settings from 25 February but that schools were being considered separately. The NSW Independent Education Union acting secretary, Carol Matthews, urged the government to follow Victoria’s lead, given the number of students still testing positive. “It is a critical element of keeping school communities safe,” he said. Matthews also said it would be “unfair” for staff and parents to have to pay for rapid tests. “It puts [teachers] under undue financial strain at a time when their salaries are not keeping pace,” Matthews said. “They are frontline staff and should not be burdened with this added expense.” The NSW plan announced at the end of January also limits interaction between year groups and calls for the use of surgical masks indoors. The measures had made for a tough start to the year for teachers, according to the NSW Teachers Federation president, Angelo Gavrielatos, but he wanted to see the strategy continue. “Teachers will tell you how challenging it is,” he said. “They’ll say that’s very challenging in the operations of a school. They’ll tell you how challenging it is teaching behind a mask. But they also know that these measures are necessary. They are an extra line of defence against the spread of Covid.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning While the state was still recording thousands of cases every day, Gavrielatos said risk mitigation was key. “Rapid antigen tests, while not perfect, are identifying cases before they enter school sites,” he said. “It makes sense to continue with rapid antigen testing. You can never overcompensate when it comes to the implementation of risk mitigation strategies.” Perrottet thanked parents who had helped their kids take part in the twice-weekly surveillance testing that was initially introduced for the first four weeks of term. “I know it has been a challenge for many,” he said. “It’s been incredibly successful and instilling confidence in both our teachers and our parents.”",News/Australia news,NSW encouraged to follow Victoria’s lead and extend rapid Covid testing in schools,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/18/nsw-encouraged-to-follow-victorias-lead-and-extend-rapid-covid-testing-in-schools
2/18/2022,"From the Australian Open and its inaugural Pride day and the AFLW’s recent Pride round to this week’s announcement that Adelaide United will be hosting an A-League Men Pride game, the celebration and promotion of LGBTIQ+ inclusion has gathered momentum of late. Add to that the increased visibility of LGBTIQ+ athletes, including the footballer Josh Cavallo and non-binary AFLW players Darcy Vescio and Tori Groves-Little, it signifies an important chapter in Australian sport, as journeys towards the inclusion of LGBTIQ+ people officially begin. For many years, sport has lagged behind wider society, dug its head in the sand around any LGBTIQ+ related issues and neglected the welfare of LGBTIQ+ athletes. So why all these pride rounds and events in sport suddenly?  Pride celebrations are a tool used by organisations to address problems associated with discrimination and equity surrounding LGBTIQ+ people, whilst celebrating LGBTIQ+ people involved in their sport, their achievements and the ongoing challenges they experience. They are a specific type of diversity work whereby efforts are made to fix and address a problem. This problem, put simply, is the exclusion and marginalisation of LGBTIQ+ people in sport. The extent of this problem is still significant, and has presented sports administrators a significant challenge for decades. It does not appear to be going away anytime soon. My own research shows that we are still a long way off when it comes to addressing the inclusion of LGBTIQ+ people in sporting environments, where discrimination is still common and a culture and history of vilification and exclusion has long lasting impacts. To further highlight the nature of the problem, recent Monash University research found that half of Australian sporting clubs involved in a study believe that “homosexuality is wrong or unnatural”. Pride games are celebratory in nature and a community development strategy which seeks to build trust, and welcome and invite LGBTIQ+ communities into sporting spaces. They are needed to help normalise inclusion as part of sporting structures, whilst creating conversations whereby people can learn, be educated, and connect with LGBTIQ+ people. Evidence around the impact of these events is encouraging too; research shows that community Pride cups and Pride themed celebrations have a positive influence on fostering supporting environments for LGBTIQ+ players. The right to host or engage with Pride initiatives is not a given however, and there must be benefit to LGBTIQ+ communities, not simply to make a sport or club look progressive. You cannot cherry pick which part of Pride you engage with or celebrate; we are a diverse community but you cannot leave the trans and gender diverse community out of these celebrations. Sports embarking on this journey must get their own shop in order first and foremost, before any big spectacles. These steps might include education and training, policy development (for example trans-inclusion policies), anti-homophobia and transphobia campaigns or participation programs. Organisations like Proud2Play are on hand to help, and in another encouraging step in Victoria, more sports have recently signed up to the rainbow roadmap – a sector-wide initiative between Proud2Play and Vic Sport, which helps sports become “rainbow ready” and engage with inclusion in meaningful ways. But does this increase in Pride games, visibility of LGBTIQ+ athletes and celebrations show progress? Or does it hide and gloss over the lack of action in the space? On the one hand it shows a positive step in that sports are engaging with this particular type of diversity, albeit a lot later than other areas. On the other hand, it shows the often reactive and ad hoc nature of many sports which have not fully engaged or consulted with LGBTIQ+ communities. To be clear though, hosting a one-off Pride round, walking 800m down the rainbow filled streets of Midsumma or Mardi Gras, or posting a tweet in support of gay athletes is not going to solve complex problems such as homophobia and transphobia in sport. Furthermore, sports can become so fixated with their pursuit towards inclusion – adding rainbow banners to social media posts and logos – that they simultaneously fail to address the very reasons why LGBTIQ+ people do not feel included in the first place: anti LGBTIQ+ discrimination. This came to light recently when Melbourne Victory were fined $5,000 after some of their fans directed anti-gay abuse at Josh Cavallo. But when used properly, sport can positively impact an LGBTIQ+ person, which my latest research in tennis found; playing tennis in inclusive environments increased social and mental wellbeing amongst LGBTIQ+ participants and fostered social capital. This social capital proved to be crucial in times of social isolation and loneliness throughout the pandemic. There is evidence to show that several sports in Australia are now on their path towards the inclusion of LGBTIQ+ people, but there is much work to do, and as recent controversies have shown, it may be a bumpy ride along the way. At the forefront of this work must be trans and gender diverse people, who are disproportionately affected by exclusion in sport. The sport sector is better off and a stronger institution with LGBTIQ+ people in it. By letting discrimination linger, we reduce opportunities to find the next Olympic champion, coach or volunteer, but more importantly, we lose the ability to positively impact the life of an LGBTIQ+ person.",Sport/Sport,Pride celebrations must be engaged with but not simply to make a sport look progressive | Ryan Storr,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/18/pride-celebrations-must-be-engaged-with-but-not-simply-to-make-a-sport-look-progressive
