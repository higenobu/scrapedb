2/23/2022,"Republicans have long had a toughness fetish. Going back to the early days of the Cold War, its flip side has been the insinuation that Democrats are weaklings ready to sell out the country to its enemies, with the GOP eager to serve proudly and unapologetically as America's lone defenders abroad. No one should be surprised that the script has already been updated to account for recent distressing events on the border separating Russia and Ukraine. Late last week, conservative talk-show host Hugh Hewitt observed in a tweet that ""the tyrant Putin invaded Ukraine in 2014 and will do so again in 2022 but did not do so between 2017 and 2020."" Without mentioning his name, Hewitt implied Putin became a pussycat because of Donald Trump's steadfast leadership as president. But wait — wasn't Trump Putin's lapdog for the entirety of his presidency, famously refusing to say anything remotely critical about him and even siding with Putin's denial of Russian interference in the 2016 election against evidence provided by America's own intelligence services? No doubt realizing the absurdity of the claim, National Review's Rich Lowry (and others) leapt in a few days later to add a layer of nuance to the assertion. It's not that Trump was tougher than President Biden, but that he was more erratic: ""The sheer unpredictably of Trump, his anger at being defied or disrespected, his willingness to take the occasional big risk (the Soleimani strike), all had to make Putin frightened or wary of him in a way that he simply isn't of Joe Biden."" There may be some truth in this revision of the thesis. Trump was indeed volatile, impulsive, and capricious. It's certainly possible that Putin feared a move against Ukraine could spark a massive military response from Trump. But it's far more likely he hoped for something very different. As Jonathan Last pointedly suggested on Tuesday in his newsletter for The Bulwark, Trump expressed his desire on numerous occasions for the United States to withdraw from NATO altogether. He did so while campaigning for president in 2016. He did so as president. And apparently, he even made clear to advisers he hoped to make it a reality after he won re-election in 2020. Since such a withdrawal is Putin's fondest wish, it makes far greater sense to suppose his relative restraint during the Trump presidency was a function of a reasonable expectation he might get everything he wanted without having to fire a shot. Only now, with a less … unorthodox American president in charge, has war become Putin's only means of advancing his more immediate aim of ensuring NATO moves no closer to Russian territory. Putin didn't play nice guy from 2017 to 2020 because he was afraid of Donald Trump. He did so because he knew he had nothing to fear from the fanboy in the Oval Office.

2/23/2022,"By Maha El Dahan, Andrew Mills and Marwa Rashad DOHA/LONDON (Reuters) - Neither Qatar nor any other single country has the capacity to replace Russian gas supplies to Europe with liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the event of disruption due to a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Qatar's energy minister said on Tuesday. With most of Qatari volumes are locked into long-term contracts mostly to Asian buyers, the amount of divertable volumes that can be shipped to Europe is only 10-15%, Saad al-Kaabi added. Kaabi's comments renewed concerns over Europe's security of gas supplies as tensions escalated between Russia and Ukraine on Tuesday after Moscow ordered troops into two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine. ""Russia (provides) I think 30-40% of the supply to Europe. There is no single country that can replace that kind of volume, there isn’t the capacity to do that from LNG,"" Kaabi told reporters at a gas conference in Doha. ""Most of the LNG are tied to long-term contracts and destinations that are very clear. So, to replace that sum of volume that quickly is almost impossible,"" he said. The United States and its European allies are set to announce fresh sanctions against Russia after President Vladimir Putin formally recognised the independence of the two regions in eastern Ukraine. The sanctions could affect the Russian flow of gas into Europe. Germany on Tuesday halted the Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea gas pipeline project, designed to double the flow of Russian gas direct to Germany. The move sent gas prices higher on Tuesday Qatar and other countries such as Japan have recently been approached by the United States to reroute gas supplies to Europe in case conflict escalates. Sources told Reuters that Qatari LNG exports have been lower over the past few days as two of its mega trains have been down, another factor that could limit the spare amount to be sent to Europe. Japan said earlier this month it will divert some LNG cargoes to Europe after requests from the United States and the European Union. However, the few cargoes that arrived to Europe were cargoes already scheduled under a joint venuture between Japan's JERA and France's EDF and there was no incremental added supply. Currently facing a cold spell that has depleted LNG inventories, Japan is experiencing re-stocking demand and so it needs more LNG supply. ""We’ve not seen anything concrete happen to supply yet. That could obviously change, but clearly, Qatar and Japan will be limited in their ability to help with extra cargoes if Europe loses access to Russian gas,"" said Robert Songer, LNG analyst at commodities intelligence firm ICIS.

2/23/2022,"STORY: Trudeau at a news conference said, ""If Putin thinks it is in his interest to invade another sovereign country, we have to demonstrate to him that it is not. in his interest, that he will not come through this better or stronger, that this is harming Russia."" As Trudeau called on Russia to return to the negotiating table he also announced sanctions. ""We will ban Canadians from all financial dealings with the so-called independent states of Luhansk and Donesk,"" he said. ""We will sanction members of the Russian Parliament, who voted for the illegal decision to recognize these so-called republics. We will ban Canadians from engaging in purchases of Russian sovereign debt. And we will also apply sanctions on two state backed Russian banks, and prevent any financial dealings with them."" The European Union has agreed to blacklist banks involved in financing separatist activities in eastern Ukraine. Russia's large banks are deeply integrated into the global financial system, meaning sanctions could be felt far beyond its borders. Data from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) shows that European lenders hold the lion's share of the nearly $30 billion in foreign banks' exposure to Russia.",Politics/Reuters Videos,"Putin will not 'come through this better,' says Trudeau",https://news.yahoo.com/putin-not-come-better-says-012310196.html
