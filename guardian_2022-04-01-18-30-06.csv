4/1/2022,"“When the pandemic hit, I lost all my work pretty much overnight,” says Gemma Griffin, 43, from Suffolk. “I’m a knitwear designer. I’d worked for various UK high street brands since leaving university, then I went freelance three years ago.” When Covid arrived, Griffin hadn’t been self-employed for long enough to qualify for government funding. She was also living in a new house and caring for her eight-year-old daughter. “I really, really needed something else to do,” she says. She decided to use the time to renovate her home. “My dad was a painter and decorator, so I’ve always been used to getting on with home projects,” she says. “We’d just moved in and there was some disrepair, so I wanted to see what I could do.” Her first project was refurbishing furniture for her daughter’s bedroom. “I found some old wardrobes and painted them,” she says. “I sent a few people pictures and then some people started asking if I could do pieces for them.” Griffin began looking for old items of furniture to makeover. “It was a beautiful summer, which meant I could work outside in the evenings,” she says. “I got an Instagram account, @ten:09, to show people what I was doing, and it grew from there.” The time she spent on furniture restoration proved valuable in more ways than one. “It’s amazingly therapeutic,” she says. Griffin begins her process “by spending hours on online marketplaces and visiting local charity shops. When I see the right piece, whether it’s a table or an old cabinet, I know instantly what I’m going to do with it.” She then sands the item down, primes and paints or renovates it, a process that probably takes around a week. “I do everything with proper love and devotion, except the priming, which is the only stage I hate,” she says. “But, for example, if there’s glass that needs replacing, I’ll go to a traditional old-fashioned glassmaker. When I’m working on furniture I am so absorbed, and my hands and my mind are occupied. It’s incredibly enjoyable.” She also loves bringing tatty or damaged pieces back to life. “I think about who has owned it before and how many years they lived with that furniture and used it. Pieces from the 1920s and 1930s were probably someone’s prized possessions at one point. It’s a great feeling to reclaim them, stop them being considered junk and for them to go on and become a prized possession for another family. As I’m working with one-off pieces – people tend to buy them because they love them rather than because they’re after furniture that fills a practical gap. So the pieces go off to homes where they’ll be valued.” Griffin is also still in contact with most of her customers. “It’s partly because there’s a little community, and partly people coming back and saying: ‘Could you do me some bedside tables?” It wasn’t meant to be a business; it was honestly just something to keep me occupied. But now it really is starting to become a business.” Most of her income still comes from her work in the fashion industry, but furniture is increasingly part of her working life. “I am getting personal commissions, such as one for a shop in Carnaby Street that I delivered and placed in situ myself.” she says. “Then there’s an art gallery that takes my furniture to sell alongside their art. And they don’t sell it as old furniture, they sell it as statement pieces.” Her new website, built after a consultation with GoDaddy, should help her take Ten:09 Furniture even further. “I want to expand into ceramics, vases and crockery and anything I can help to look amazing again. A proper website really helps, because it means people can search properly and that I can group things by type – vases in one place, bedside tables in another. Instagram is great as a showcase, but you need a proper site if customers are going to be looking for specific things. “Interiors are a massive passion for me, they always have been. I love hunting and foraging and finding things, then being able to make a new space in the world for them. So I would love to make this an ongoing business, and getting a new website is a big part of that. Restoring furniture really does make me happy.” Find out more about how GoDaddy can help you take your passion project to the next level",Follow your passion,My side hustle is more life enhancing than therapy,https://www.theguardian.com/follow-your-passion/2022/apr/01/my-side-hustle-is-more-life-enhancing-than-therapy
4/1/2022,"The national lottery operator Camelot is launching a high court challenge to the Gambling Commission’s decision to hand over the operation of the draw to a rival after 28 years, accusing the regulator of getting the decision “badly wrong”. In a statement, Camelot’s chief executive, Nigel Railton, said: “We are launching a legal challenge today in our capacity as an applicant for the fourth [national lottery] licence because we firmly believe that the Gambling Commission has got this decision badly wrong.” Allwyn, a lottery operator owned by the Czech billionaire Karel Komárek, is in line to take over from Camelot in 2024, after beating the incumbent in a four-way battle that also included Sisal, owned by the Paddy Power parent, Flutter, and the media tycoon Richard Desmond. “When we received the result, we were shocked by aspects of the decision,” Railton said. “Despite lengthy correspondence, the commission has failed to provide a satisfactory response. We are therefore left with no choice but to ask the court to establish what happened. “Irrespective of Camelot’s dual roles as current operator and applicant for the next national lottery licence, the competition is one of the largest UK government-sponsored procurements and the process deserves independent scrutiny. “Separately, more than 1,000 Camelot employees work tirelessly to successfully operate the national lottery under the current licence and, at the very least, they are owed a proper explanation.”",News/UK news,National lottery: Camelot launches high court challenge over losing licence,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/01/national-lottery-camelot-launches-high-court-challenge-over-losing-licence
4/1/2022,"My earliest reading memoryI was eight or so before I was finally able to read. Then I was away. I usually went up to Eason’s in Dún Laoghaire on a Saturday with my pocket money and bought a Puffin book. One was a story about a boy living in London in a cul-de-sac, and there was a poignant subplot about a mother who had been a ballerina. I don’t know who wrote it or what it was called but I would love to be told. My favourite book growing upAs a little boy I went with my father to see David Lean’s Oliver Twist at the cinema, and I thought it was something real happening in front of me. When Oliver is brought in to see Fagin at the end, and Fagin thinks Oliver can free him – well, I am still not over it. Then, much later, when I was off sick from school in Dublin, I read the actual novel, mesmerised, traumatised. The book that changed me as a teenagerI read James Joyce’s A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man standing under the little trees in New Square in Trinity College Dublin. I was 18. But looking back, it seems to me to mark the transition from ultimate childhood to something slightly more advanced. The writer who changed my mindI’m still looking to have my mind changed by a book, to my betterment. I’m ready. The book that made me want to be a writerIt was a mixture of two books, folded one into the other like a strange cake: Middlemarch by George Eliot and The Return of the Native by Thomas Hardy. I got it into my head that a writer’s prose should be in essence his or her birdsong. The author I came back toYears ago, I couldn’t see the point of John Galsworthy. Recently I have been reading his letters, and taken an interest in how his contemporaries saw him (notably the Celestial Liar, Ford Madox Ford). The book I rereadI have always loved Joseph Conrad’s Victory. Recently, teaching at UCD, I asked my students to read it. I had to reread it myself for class, and was shocked how I only remembered certain strands in it. And the things I had not really noticed and was not interested in, in 1979 Paris, now seemed the most important parts of the novel. The book I could never read againI adored the Palliser novels of Anthony Trollope, which I read while living on Paros, circa 1984. But could I read them now, in the same spirit of adoration? Maybe I should find out. The book I discovered later in lifeA book I read only some years ago, and was astonished by its modernity, its formidable intelligence and its punk sensibility, was The Last September by Elizabeth Bowen. The author I am currently readingAlgernon Charles Swinburne. The thing about Swinburne is, he had a huge influence on early Yeats and Ezra Pound, and if you don’t read him, you are really reading Yeats and Pound with one eye closed. My comfort readWhenever I need to remind myself what a beautifully made poem looks like – which is a sort of comfort – I look back at the poems of Richard Murphy, especially High Island.

4/1/2022,"Donald Trump will return to Michigan on Saturday for his first visit since November 2020 when he spent the final hours of his presidential election campaign desperately trying to hold on to the state and fend off nationwide defeat to his Democratic rival Joe Biden. This time his visit will be motivated by an attempt to forge a path to victory in the 2024 presidential election, in which he has hinted he may run again. If that is his intention, he is going about it in a very irregular fashion. His guest of honor at the rally he is staging in Washington Township will be bear no resemblance to the local politicians whom former US presidents normally champion. Kristina Karamo is a part-time community college professor who has never held elected office and who up until 18 months ago was relatively little known outside conservative and religious circles in the Detroit suburb in which she lives. Karamo, 36, describes herself as a defender of the Christian faith and espouses some arresting beliefs. She opposes teaching evolution and has called public schools “government indoctrination camps”; she argues that many Americans live in poverty because “they just make dumb decisions”; and she contends that the instigators of the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol were “totally antifa posing as Trump supporters”. There are two clues as to why Trump is willing to make the 1,200-mile schlepp from his home in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, to chilly Michigan on Karamo’s behalf. The first is the position for which she is standing in November’s midterm elections – secretary of state. The post-holder acts as chief elections officer in Michigan, and in that capacity will have considerable sway over how the presidential election is conducted in 2024. What happens in the state could then in turn have enormous national implications: in both 2016 and 2020 Michigan was pivotal in securing the White House for Trump and Biden respectively. The second clue to Trump’s thinking is the language he used when he endorsed her last September. “She is strong on crime,” he said, “including the massive crime of election fraud”. What initially drew Karamo to Trump’s attention was the prominent role she played in Michigan in promoting his “big lie”, the false conspiracy theory that the 2020 election was stolen from him. From almost total obscurity, Karamo was thrown into the limelight when she began to cry foul about what she claimed was illegal vote counting in the overwhelmingly African American city of Detroit. It all began with a basic misunderstanding. As America held its breath in the days after the election, when it remained uncertain whether Biden or Trump would win, Karamo relocated herself to the TCF Center in downtown Detroit where poll workers were counting 174,000 absentee ballots. Karamo was one of scores of Trump supporters who – without any formal training in election procedures or laws – designated themselves as “poll challengers” watching over the politically-charged count. The convention space was packed to overflowing, with about 900 poll workers counting ballots, as another 400 or so media and political observers looked on. Over the next 24 hours, TCF began to resemble, in the description of the Detroit Free Press, a high-stakes sports match “complete with yelling, taunting, cheering, fists pounding on glass and unruly challengers being hauled off by cops”. Amid the melee, Karamo claimed that she personally witnessed fraudulent activity in which ballots were switched illegally from Trump to Biden. A week after the election, by which time Biden had been declared winner, she filled out an “incident report” in her neat closely-spaced handwriting. The three-page document looks like an official police report, though the small print at the bottom says: “Paid for by Donald J Trump for President, Inc.” In it, Karamo gives her account of what she claims to have witnessed. She was standing at an “adjudication table” where ballots that are incorrectly filled in are scrutinized. She spotted a ballot on the screen in which a voter appeared to have cast their ballot along straight-party lines but for both main parties. That was clearly an error as you can’t vote for more than one presidential candidate at a time. Karamo says in the “incident report” that she watched as a poll worker unilaterally decided to award the ballot to Biden, no questions asked. When she complained and called for a supervisor, she claims she was told not to talk to the election staff. The supervisor, she wrote, instructed the poll worker “to ‘push it through’, when the ballot legally should have been rejected. I said I’m challenging the ballot… but he continued to tell the worker to push it through.” That sounds like a blatant abuse of election integrity, taking an effectively spoiled ballot and counting it for Biden. Karamo was incensed, and on the back of that eruption of anger began her meteoric rise as an advocate for Trump’s big lie that the election was rigged. The problem was that Karamo’s interpretation of what happened to the wrongly-completed ballot was based on a simple misreading of election procedure. Chris Thomas, Michigan’s former director of elections who oversaw the state’s vote counts for 36 years under both Republican and Democratic administrations, told the Guardian why. He explained that when Karamo heard “push it through” she assumed that meant “give the vote to Biden”. But that was a misunderstanding. In fact, the edict “push it through” when issued at the adjudication table is in effect an order to discard “overvotes” – ballots like the one Karamo witnessed where more than the maximum number of candidates are selected. “‘Push it through’ means you are done with it, and the vote is tabulated as a non-count,” Thomas said. In other words, the call to fraudulently count the ballot for Biden which Karamo thought she had heard was in fact an instruction to place the vote in the electronic equivalent of a dustbin where it would be stored but discounted. What did Thomas make of the fact that Karamo made a hue and cry about fraud based on a mistaken interpretation of electoral practices? “This is the problem when people make all these comments when they don’t understand the system,” he said. “They see what they want to see.” Thomas was present inside the TCF Center for the duration of the two-day count, working as a senior consultant and handling disputes. With his almost four decades of non-partisan experience of orchestrating elections, how would he rate the way the ballots were handled inside the space? “The count was totally above board,” he said. “It was accurate and it was fair. The count was good.” That one mistaken claim of fraud propelled Karamo into the dizzy heights of the Trump firmament. Sean Hannity billed her as a “whistleblower” on his primetime Fox News show, she was invited by Republicans to testify before a legislative committee, she participated in a four-state lawsuit seeking to overturn the presidential election result that went all the way up to the US supreme court (which promptly rejected it). Emboldened, her baseless critique of rampant election fraud became more forthright. “I was a poll challenger at TCF Center in Detroit,” she told the podcast Coffee and a Mike. “I saw illegal activity and I realized if we don’t cure our election system we no longer have a republic, we have a fake country, an illusion of a country, so I have to do something.” That “something” was to stand for Michigan secretary of state – a position that would potentially allow her to take her discredited views on voter fraud and use them to Trump’s advantage in 2024. So far, she is doing very well in the race, with a credible shot at prevailing. With Trump’s enthusiastic backing, she has amassed a campaign war-chest of more than $228,000, more than any other Republican vying for the secretary of state nomination. As an indication of how much heat the race is generating, Karamo has attracted more than 2,000 individual donors – more than all candidates combined in the last secretary of state contest in 2018. Michigan’s incumbent secretary of state, Jocelyn Benson, is running for re-election as the Democratic candidate. She told the Guardian that the steam that has built up around the race this year is an indication of its high stakes. “This secretary of state race is the top targeted race in the country, and I am the top targeted incumbent secretary of state seeking re-election this year. Trump’s decision to endorse someone running against me, and his rally on Saturday, are a warning that what is unfolding here should be on everyone’s radar – democracy is on the ballot in November,” Benson said. Benson was in charge of the presidential election count in Michigan in 2020, which Biden won by 154,188 votes. She believes Karamo was present in the TCF Center “simply for the purpose of interfering with the counting process, causing chaos and confusion and spreading misinformation”. Asked what would happen if the Trump-supporting conspiracy theorist won in November and took her job, Benson replied: “Michigan would have a chief election officer more than willing to find those extra votes if the candidate asked them. It would be akin to putting an arsonist in charge of the fire department, or giving the keys to the vault to a bank robber.” As the secretary of state contest gains momentum, progressive groups are mobilizing to try and stop Karamo. The left-leaning End Citizens United/Let America Vote has launched a new “democracy defender program”, investing $7m in secretary of state and attorney general races where Trump-endorsed big lie candidates are on the ticket. “Karamo sought to silence and overturn the will of Michigan voters. Her false and extreme rhetoric is a threat to democracy because it undermines faith in our elections,” said a spokesperson for the group, Tina Olechowski. The Guardian reached out to Karamo, but she did not respond. As the race hots up she continues to claim that Trump won the 2020 election and to demand a “forensic audit” of the results – even though “forensic audits” do not exist under Michigan election law. In October she spoke at a QAnon convention in Las Vegas where she joined other pro-Trump big lie candidates running for secretary of state positions around the country. “She was one of several political candidates appealing to QAnon for political gain in ways that could have a drastic impact on future elections,” said Alex Kaplan, senior researcher at the watchdog Media Matters for America. Karamo has said that if she wins in November, her role as secretary of state will be “to make sure elections are secure and that the result represents the will of the people, not those corrupting the system”. That’s not how Benson sees it. Karamo, she said, is one of several Trump-endorsed secretary of state candidates around the country who appear willing “to violate their oath, the law and the principles of our democracy in service of their party and their private agenda”. And if that happens, Benson said, “then democracy will have been dealt perhaps its greatest blow since the origins of our country”.",News/US news,The latest threat to democracy?

4/1/2022,"Hello and good morning. The UN atomic watchdog is investigating Ukrainian claims that Russian soldiers occupying Chernobyl nuclear power station left after receiving high doses of radiation. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it could not confirm the claims by the Ukrainian state power company Energoatom and was seeking an independent assessment. It will send its first “assistance and support mission” to Chernobyl, in northern Ukraine, in the next few days. Energoatom said the Russians dug trenches in the forest inside the exclusion zone at the site of the world’s worst nuclear disaster in 1986, and that the troops “panicked at the first sign of illness” that “showed up very quickly” and began preparing to leave. Meanwhile, Energoatom also said the Russian side had formally agreed to hand back to Ukraine the responsibility for protecting Chernobyl. It shared the scan of a document signed by people it identified as a senior staff member at Chernobyl and the Russian military official assigned to guarding Chernobyl. What is Chernobyl? The plant is the site of the world’s worst nuclear accident in 1986. Staff continue to oversee the safe storage of spent nuclear fuel and supervise the concrete-encased remains of the reactor that exploded. When did Russia take control of Chernobyl? Russian troops seized the nuclear plant soon after the 24 February invasion. There have been concerns over the past month about power cuts and fighting making staff shift rotations difficult. What claims is the UN agency likely to investigate? Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk claimed Russian troops dug trenches in the forest and were exposed to radiation. Some reports suggest soldiers are being sent to a special medical facility in Belarus after driving tanks through the “dead zone” around the nuclear plant, kicking up radioactive dust. (These claims are unverified.) An aide to the mayor of Mariupol has said the besieged southern Ukrainian city remains closed for anyone trying to enter and is “very dangerous” for anyone trying to leave. Petro Andryushchenko said Russian forces have been preventing even the smallest amount of humanitarian supplies reaching trapped residents. A convoy of buses that set out for Mariupol did not reach the city, Ukrainian officials said last night. Russia had promised a limited ceasefire along the route from Mariupol to the Ukraine-held city of Zaporizhzhia. Repeated efforts to set up humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of up to 170,000 people who remain in Mariupol, which has suffered four weeks of bombardment and dwindling supplies, have failed. Ukraine has accused Russian forces of shelling supposedly safe routes outside of several fighting hotspots, claims that Moscow denies. Meanwhile, insiders in the UK intelligence agency are divided over GCHQ boss Jeremy Fleming’s strategy of leaking intelligence, my colleague Dan Sabbagh reports. Fleming revealed details such as Russian forces “accidentally shooting down their own aircraft”, sparking debate among spy insiders over the strategy. The reggae singer Eddy Grant may succeed where the attorney general of New York state and other powerful figures have struggled – by forcing Donald Trump to answer questions under oath in a legal proceeding. Grant sued the former president and his campaign over the use of his song Electric Avenue in an ad in 2020. In the ad, Grant’s song plays over an animation of Joe Biden traveling slowly in a handcar, after a Trump campaign train passes at high speed. Remarks from Biden are also heard. Trump has failed to have the suit dismissed and claims it was fair use under a satire exemption. Who is Eddy Grant? A 74-year-old Guyanese-British reggae musician. The song Electric Avenue was released in 1982. How much is Grant seeking in damages? $300,000 for copyright infringement. How many times has the video been viewed? More than 13.7m times, the lawsuit claims. A Palestinian baby has died after her treatment was delayed by Israel’s blockade of Gaza. Fatima al-Masri, a 19-month-old with a hole in her heart, waited five months for Israel to issue a permit allowing her to travel for medical treatment. Amazon workers in New York are close to voting to form a union today. It represents a major win for labor activists who have failed in previous efforts to organize at the tech giant, which is the second largest private employer in the US. “Workers here have shown what is possible,” said one activist. UK prime minister Boris Johnson has U-turned on his U-turn to ban LGBT conversion therapy. On Thursday, reports said Johnson intended to block planned legislation banning LGBT conversion therapy. But he backed down after a furious response and decided to move ahead to outlaw the practices. H&M has pledged to end shopfloor sexual violence in India after a garment worker was murdered by her supervisor. The company signed a legally binding agreement with a major Indian clothing supplier. Last January, Jeyasre Kathiravel was found dead after her shift, with her supervisor reportedly confessing to the murder and awaiting trail. LA police offered to arrest actor Will Smith for slapping presenter Chris Rock at the Academy Awards, the ceremony producer Will Packer said. But authorities took no action because Rock declined to press charges. In 2021, the National Crime Information Center listed more than 9,500 Indigenous people as missing, with 1,554 of those cases still active by the end of the year. One year after the Department of the Interior announced it was launching a new investigative unit to prioritize the crisis of missing and murdered Native Americans, at least nine Indigenous families have watched jurisdictional issues and miscommunication hamper efforts by the unit to investigate their relatives’ cases, or been met with months of silence. “I carry a clicker to count the number of people I’ve hugged – my record is 1,300 in a day, at a retail convention in Las Vegas – and choose cities where I hope I’ll be welcomed,” says David Sylvester. “On 12 September 2001, I learned that one of my closest childhood friends had died in the World Trade Center. The grief was so awful, I was determined to channel it into something with purpose.” The International Seabed Authority, the UN-affiliated organization overseeing the controversial new industry of deep-sea mining, has been accused of failings of transparency after an independent body responsible for reporting on negotiations was kicked out. Scientists have warned that the damage to ecosystems from mining nickel, cobalt and other metals on the deep-seabed would be “irreversible” and “reckless”. Sometimes violent conflict breaks out between siskins, greenfinches and tree sparrows for a perch on the feeder, writes Phil Gates in his country diary. Perhaps that’s what providing limitless luxury food in a single location does to bird behaviour: it promotes competition and conflict. A siskin needs to collect about 10,000 alder seeds to match its body weight. It could spend most daylight hours seeking natural food. Or, it could spend an hour jostling by the sunflower seed feeder.

4/1/2022,"The six Oscars picked up by Denis Villeneuve’s Dune on Sunday night in Los Angeles might not seem like a bad haul, especially given no other movie managed to garner more than three. And yet such technical categories as cinematography, editing, score, visual effects, production design and sound are not usually considered to be among the major prizes, even if the movie’s spectacular achievements in all these essential disciplines were critical to making it such a splendid feast for the senses on the big screen. Dune was one of 2021’s biggest critical smashes, but in many ways its failure to pick up any awards for acting, direction or producing tally with a sense that the first episode in Villeneuve’s space saga relied more on spectacle and epic sweep than the traditional Oscar virtues of pathos and big-hearted warmth. It is a movie that glues your eyes to the screen, so rapid is the action, so electrifying are the fight scenes, yet it is not likely to ever make someone shed a tear, or recommend it to a disheartened friend who needs to rediscover their inner mojo. Driving Miss Daisy, or The Help it is not. Might the Academy end up rewarding Villeneuve with major prizes once Dune: Part Two hits multiplexes in October 2023? Something similar happened nearly 20 years ago, when Peter Jackson had to wait for 2003’s Return of the King to doff its feathered cap during awards season. Prior to that film, Jackson’s previous two Lord of the Rings episodes had picked up only five gongs at two different ceremonies, and all in technical categories. At the 2004 Academy Awards, Return of the King almost swept the board with a staggering 11 Oscars – a joint record with Titanic and Ben-Hur that it still holds to this day. It also became the first fantasy film to win the best picture prize. Dune (part one) is already well ahead of where Jackson was at this stage, so might the Academy hold back its major prizes for the second instalment? Much of that perhaps depends on whether Part Two hits the kind of emotional high notes that the New Zealand film-maker strummed throughout his extended foray into Middle Earth. Villeneuve is more than capable of imbuing futuristic fantasies with gorgeously intense moments of wonder, as his dazzling but deeply human alien-encounter flick Arrival proved beyond doubt. And it is hardly a shock that Dune’s first episode never quite zoomed to the stirring levels of, say, Gandalf’s fall into darkness in the Mines of Moria during The Fellowship of the Ring. JRR Tolkien always intended his 1954-55 epic high-fantasy saga as a three-part journey, and therefore ensured each section featured its own powerful climax. Frank Herbert’s Dune, on the other hand, is not split so easily in two. Moreover, it is essentially the story of a wronged scion who (spoiler alert for those who have not read the full Dune series) eventually discovers that with great power comes Putin-like levels of megalomania. There is a more complex emotional arc here than the one of warm-hearted homunculi battling to save the world from evil presented by Tolkien. It was never likely to be a project that connected with mainstream audiences in the same way Lord of the Rings did. It seems unlikely then, that Villeneuve and his team only need hold on until Part Two to see Dune finally grab the key Oscar gongs it perhaps deserves. Unless that second episode can go beyond giant space worms, witchy cults and warring dynasties, and give us a little bit more human joy and red-blooded awe. The first part taught us that one’s eyes turn a cold and distant blue after chowing down on too much “spice”: it may be a lot to ask, given the icy nature of Herbert’s space saga, but if it is to triumph at the Oscars, Part Two will probably need to show Timothée Chalamet’s Paul Atreides glowing with something a little more heartfelt.",Arts/Film,Can Dune: Part Two follow Lord of the Rings to win best picture Oscar?,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/01/dune-part-2-win-best-picture-oscar-lord-of-the-rings
4/1/2022,"How do you make vampires feel menacing again? For game developer Big Bad Wolf, the answer was to make the living dead responsible for everything wrong with our world. In an age where the lines between conspiracy and reality are increasingly blurred, Vampire: The Masquerade – Swansong makes things reassuringly explicable. Despite all our species’ posturing, it turns out, an ancient council of vampires has been quietly pulling the strings for millennia. Slavery? A vampiric plan. Genocide? Vampires have profited from it, time and time again. In other words, what’s truly terrifying about these vampires is that they aren’t feral beasts, they’re the world’s elite – and you’re utterly powerless to stop them. This refreshingly grownup vampire game uses this murky world of conspiracy and politics as its basis. Unlike the hugely male-dominated Dungeons and Dragons scene, Vampire: The Masquerade’s dicey adventures attracts players in their 30s and 40s, of whom 40% are women. Handed the keys to the cult classic tabletop game, this French developer’s upcoming adaptation feels suave, sophisticated and slightly erotic, set in a darkly glamorous fictional Boston. “In the pen and paper role playing game you were a powerful being, but it’s not just about fighting – you can be powerful through dialogue, through cleverness,” explains the game’s writer, Laure Delmas. “For us, the question was always: how can we give players the agency and freedom to do what they want?” In the mission I play, I’m thrust into the leather shoes of an ancient vampire posing as an FBI agent. Tasked with solving a grisly murder in a Manhattan apartment, I find our decapitated victim slumped across the marble floor. How did this ally of the vampire council meet his end? I’m tasked with questioning vampires and humans alike, forcing me to jot down notes in an actual real world notepad in order to get my facts in order. You’ll need to have your story straight, because your opponents won’t give you a second chance. A highlight of my demo are the game’s intriguing confrontations, which feel ripped straight from the tattered pages of a pen and paper session. When you find yourself needing to extract some vital information from a target, you will trigger an intense conversational duel. In order to assert your unholy power over your prey you’ll need to choose your answers carefully, rolling a virtual die in order to see whether you’re persuasive enough for your quarry to succumb to your will. It’s hungry work. The clock is always ticking, and making important decisions without feeding will make you sloppy – so you must lure tasty humans away from the crowd and drain them dry before diving back into interrogations. As it turns out, I’m not a particularly persuasive vampire – I lost all of my confrontations, causing a newly turned daywalking vampire to flee into a cloud of smog. Interestingly I’m told that the information you do or don’t find will affect what the vampiric council knows, and how your next missions pan out. “Hitman and Deus Ex were a big influence, in the way you interact with the world and the choices you have,” explains lead quest designer, Eliott Hipeau. “You’re going to have to respect the masquerade, you’re going to hide yourself in the shadows and not be seen. And you have to learn how to live in the lion’s den.” You will play as three different vampires on different legs of their vampiric journeys. One of them, Leysha, a newly turned member of the troubled Malkavian clan, finds herself still struggling with that most human of ailments: lapsing mental health. As you attempt to navigate the world through her eyes, Leysha will sometimes prove an unreliable narrator. “This is something I feel very proud of,” explains Laure, who has a background in neuropsychology, “first just to depict mental illness, which is not something we see in a lot of video games, and then to tackle it in a way that feels true and honest. I enjoyed the challenge of trying to portray how vampires see mental illness, which is something that is typically human, and how weird that can feel to powerful beings that don’t have such problems.” Playing like a mix of LA Noire, Deus Ex and a vampiric Hitman, Vampire: The Masquerade – Swansong offers up a disarmingly unique take on the blood-sucking fantasy. It’s about quietly maintaining the status quo of the vampiric masquerade by quietly and ruthlessly manipulating your prey. And it certainly won’t give you unwelcome Twilight flashbacks. Vampire: The Masquerade – Swansong is released on 19 May on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4/5 and Xbox One/Series X/S.",Arts/Games,"In this game, vampires aren’t feral beasts – they’re the global elite",https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/apr/01/in-this-game-vampires-arent-feral-beasts-theyre-the-global-elite
