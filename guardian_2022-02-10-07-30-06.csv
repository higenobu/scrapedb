2/10/2022,"Jürgen Klopp has credited the strongest squad of his Liverpool tenure with the team’s continued pursuit of four trophies this season. The Liverpool manager is in uncharted territory for this stage of a campaign, with a place in the Carabao Cup final, the fifth round of the FA Cup, a last-16 Champions League tie and a Premier League title race on his agenda. Liverpool are at home to Leicester on Thursday and have Mohamed Salah available after his return from the Africa Cup of Nations.  Although Sadio Mané is unlikely to feature because of a delayed return from Senegal’s celebrations and Jordan Henderson has a back problem, Klopp’s squad is in otherwise rude health for a crucial phase of the season. He believes it is the strongest one he has had since arriving at Anfield in 2015. “It’s the first time in my life I’ve been in this position because in Germany we only have three competitions – two plus the Champions League,” Klopp said. “This is the strongest squad, there is no doubt about that. If that wasn’t the case then that means that we have got weaker over the years. “We’ve always had a strong squad. That we didn’t make it so far in four competitions in the years before is for a bunch of different reasons. Timing is important in football, as in life, and when you come through a brilliant December on three wheels, for example, then it gets a bit bumpy in January when the cup competitions start properly.” Leicester inflicted Liverpool’s last defeat on 28 December but their FA Cup humbling by Nottingham Forest on Sunday provoked outspoken criticism from their manager, Brendan Rodgers. Klopp said: “The way I know Brendan, I think he said what he said for one reason – because he wants to see a reaction from his players. That is one thing I am concerned about. That is the Leicester team I am thinking about and not the Leicester team who lost to Nottingham Forest.” Klopp admitted Salah had defeat in the Afcon final with Egypt “still on his mind” but hopes the disappointment can be channelled to Liverpool’s advantage. He said: “I don’t think there is a lot of space for more determination in Mo’s mind. When you lose a final, and we are obviously the best example for that, it is really hard but if you use it for the next big game or next big tournament then it can still be helpful He will benefit from it, we will benefit from it, but which kind exactly I don’t know.”",Sport/Football,Jürgen Klopp hails ‘strongest squad – no doubt’ of his Liverpool reign,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/09/jurgen-klopp-hails-strongest-squad-no-doubt-of-his-liverpool-reign
2/10/2022,"A top Australian intelligence chief has vowed to counter any attempts by other countries to interfere in the upcoming federal election after revealing a “recent” meddling plot had been disrupted. The head of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, Mike Burgess, on Wednesday night issued a plea to Australians not to allow the fear of foreign interference to “stoke community division” – otherwise it would have “the same corrosive impact on our democracy as foreign interference itself”.  When asked about potential meddling in the federal election due by May, Burgess said he could not talk about current operational matters “but of course foreign interference is an increasing concern”. Australia had a robust democracy, he said, and the issue was being monitored by an electoral integrity taskforce bringing together the Australian Electoral Commission and security agencies: “I’m confident we can deal with it well.” Burgess took questions from the media after using his third annual threat assessment speech to disclose that Asio had “recently detected and disrupted a foreign interference plot in the lead-up to an election in Australia”. He was vague when describing the election targeted – such as whether it was a state or territory poll – and nor did he say which country was believed responsible. He simply noted that Australia was “seeing attempts at foreign interference at all levels of government, in all states and territories”. Burgess said the case “involved a wealthy individual who maintained direct and deep connections with a foreign government and its intelligence agencies”. The goal, he said, was “secretly shaping the jurisdiction’s political scene to benefit the foreign power”. “The puppeteer hired a person to enable foreign interference operations and used an offshore bank account to provide hundreds of thousands of dollars for operating expenses,” Burgess told a gathering of parliamentarians, senior police, defence and other intelligence agency chiefs and foreign diplomats. The employee, he said, “began identifying candidates likely to run in the election who either supported the interests of the foreign government or who were assessed as vulnerable to inducements and cultivation”. Burgess said the puppeteer and the employee had “plotted ways of advancing the candidates’ political prospects through generous support, placing favourable stories in foreign language news platforms and providing other forms of assistance”. While the puppeteer “pulled the strings, the foreign government called the shots”. But the political candidates had no knowledge of the plot, he said. Burgess speculated that, if the plot were left undetected, some of the candidates might have won election. They may have been urged to hire certain associates as political staffers who could eventually feed information to the foreign government about the party’s positions on sensitive issues. “At some point, the politicians might be prevailed upon to vote a particular way on a contentious issue, or lobby colleagues to vote a certain way.” In this case, the harm was avoided, Burgess said. “The election was not interfered with. Our elections remain secure.” Asked what he meant by not allowing the fear of foreign interference to corrode society, Burgess said politicians should not avoid engaging with diaspora communities altogether. “Sadly, we’ve seen people do that,” he said. “We’re just saying exercise good judgment.” Burgess said politicians should ask good questions when offered campaign and staffing support and exercise due diligence. In broader remarks, he said thousands of Australians with access to sensitive information had been “targeted by foreign spies using social media profiles” over the past two years. Asio was also “tracking suspicious approaches on dating platforms such as Tinder, Bumble and Hinge”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Asked to elaborate, Burgess in some cases foreign spies had gained an understanding of a “vulnerability” and they would “target that vulnerability”. He urged users of such apps to be mindful that “if it seems too good to be true, it probably is”. Experts have previously warned that the deterioration in the relationship between China and Australia has led to “increased scrutiny on Australians of Chinese background”. Reports have also pointed to an increase in abusive and racist incidents. Labor has previously accused the government of failing to make clear which agency was responsible for managing the risk of foreign interference during elections, meaning critical decisions might be made “on the run”. The AEC last month urged social media companies to commit to taking down unauthorised political material in agreed timeframes to combat misinformation in elections. The electoral commissioner, Tom Rogers, also said any misinformation about the result of the federal election “would be not only be disappointing [but] outrageous”, insisting Australia had one of the most transparent and fair election processes in the world.",News/Australia news,"Election plot disrupted, Asio chief reveals – then vows to counter foreign meddling ",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/10/election-plot-disrupted-asio-chief-reveals-then-vows-to-counter-foreign-meddling
2/10/2022,"Whatever these two teams spent their mid-season winter break doing, it is to the neutral’s delight that defending cannot have featured too highly. Philippe Coutinho scored one goal and made two for the elegant Jacob Ramsey in between two goals for Daniel James that ultimately enabled Leeds United to come from 3-1 down to draw thanks to Diego Llorente’s second-half equaliser. Ezri Konsa was sent off three minutes from time, for a second booking after he raised an arm to stop Illan Meslier from launching a counter-attack, as this crazy game continued to make very little sense.  Villa initially looked refreshed from their 18-day break but, after the brightest of starts in which Coutinho’s touch was mesmerising, they went behind from a mistake that smacked more of rustiness. Tyrone Mings had been unfortunate to see his header from Douglas Luiz’s corner hit Llorente before Illan Meslier saved but at the other end it was the Villa captain’s mistake that yielded Leeds their breakthrough chance. Mings seemed to have extracted the ball off Rodrigo down the right wing only for the Leeds man to take it straight back off him. The ball ran square to James and Leeds’ makeshift centre-forward did not hesitate to drill his shot, first time, into the far bottom corner. The diminutive Wales winger does not appear to be a natural fit for the central striker’s role but, in Patrick Bamford’s continued absence and with the assistance of Mateusz Klich and Rodrigo attacking from midfield, his pace and willingness have offered Leeds an outlet. James’ cross-shot was saved by Emi Martínez’s feet before a pivotal 60 seconds swung the whole momentum of the game. Running onto Jack Harrison’s pass into the inside-right channel, James cut inside and smashed a right-footed shot against the crossbar from the edge of the penalty area. You could almost hear Marcelo Bielsa’s knees creaking as he remained in his favoured crouched position as Villa promptly went up the other end and equalised. Matt Cash, receiving Emi Buendía’s return pass from a throw-in, pulled his cross back from the right wing for Coutinho, off whom Llorente had stood rather too respectfully. The Brazilian pivoted to screw home for his second goal in his first two home games for Villa. Coutinho had been in the mood to turn it on from the off and he proceeded to make two goals for Jacob Ramsey as Villa looked set to run away with the game. First, as he shaped to receive John McGinn’s pass into the centre circle, back to goal, the on-loan Barcelona man twitched his one shoulder to indicate he was about to turn right. But then he spun the other way, lost his man and slid in a perfect pass for Ramsey to run in on goal, get his body in front of Klich, and calmly stroke home his fourth goal of an impressive debut season. Within five minutes the same combination worked their magic once more, capitalising on Leeds’ predilection for marking the man rather than the space, regardless of danger it sometimes seems. Ollie Watkins’ off-the-ball run took two defenders to the left as Coutinho weaved forwards, allowing Ramsey the space to arrive late on the right and wallop home a right-foot shot into the near top corner. Just when it appeared Villa were in control, however, James headed home Rodrigo’s deflected cross at the far post two minutes into stoppage time. As entertaining as this game was, it was almost impossible to discern a pattern. Even before the half-time whistle blew, Mings was marauding forward into the Leeds penalty area to create a chance for his Lucas Digne to stab wide. What were two defenders doing up there at that stage? What is this, total football? Totally bonkers; and all the more fun for it. Coutinho seems to be making Villa’s £33m option to buy in the summer look a good idea. Not only was he involved in all the three goals but the manner in which he could nutmeg Luke Ayling to set another attack going got the near-42,000 crowd on their feet, a curling right-footer from distance stirring the feelgood factor still further. Gerrard is clearly still searching for the right blend, however, after a very promising first 10 league games yielded 16 points. Mings cleared off or near his own line three times in under two minutes as suddenly Villa were under the cosh again. Rodrigo, receiving Stuart Dallas’s short corner, crossed from the left and the England defender could only clear Pascal Struijk’s header six yards for Llorente to crash home.",Sport/Football,Ezri Konsa sent off as Aston Villa and Leeds share six-goal thriller,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/09/aston-villa-leeds-premier-league-match-report
2/10/2022,"Joe Marler has revealed “in-house bitching” is becoming a thing of the past within the England squad after holding his hands up for how he choked during his costly lineout clanger in the defeat by Scotland. Marler admitted he froze at the crucial moment at Murrayfield but said England have collectively held an inquest into their disastrous finish to the Calcutta Cup clash. They now turn their attention to Italy on Sunday with the Leicester lock/flanker Ollie Chessum in line for a debut, having been retained as part of Eddie Jones’s 27-man squad. As expected, Courtney Lawes has again been ruled out because of a head injury sustained playing for Northampton in mid-January and, with Lewis Ludlam also injured, the 21-year-old Chessum – who Jones believes can become “a younger version of Courtney” – is set for a place in the match-day squad.  Marler’s fluffed lineout – the second of his Test career and first in nearly 10 years – gave Scotland a scrum deep in England’s 22 from which they won the decisive penalty. The loosehead prop was the nominated thrower with no hooker on the field following Luke Cowan-Dickie’s yellow card but Marler admitted he released the ball to Alex Dombrandt too late, meaning it did not travel the required five metres, handing the impetus to Scotland. The 31-year-old said he has been practising his lineout throwing again in training this week, under the instruction of the forwards coach and former hooker Richard Cockerill, but added that, as a result of Jones’s New England project, there had been little back-biting during the postmortem into Saturday’s 20-17 defeat. “With this group it is probably the tightest group I have been a part of with a lot of the youngsters, who are very good friends off the pitch and the older heads coming together a bit so it is very tight,” said Marler. “And the way we have responded to [the defeat] has been much less in-house bitching as there may have been in the past. “It has actually been a pretty level response. We did so many good things in that game but these little execution pieces we didn’t quite get right and we need to work on. So it is never as bad as we think it is and it is never as good as we think it is, so it is a pretty level response we have had from the group which is pleasing. It was disappointing and I don’t feel overly great about it, but I’m looking forward to tucking in this week and hopefully picking up the learnings of that last 20 minutes.” Asked to expand on those lessons, Marler added: “Probably throw a little bit further than three and a half metres. Probably do some throwing work this week. We’ve had chats today about what potentially we could have done better in those situations. Hopefully, we’ve had the conversations now, so if we’re in the heat of the moment in those situations again, we can get it right. “I just didn’t throw it at the right time. I should have thrown it earlier at Dombrandt. Unfortunately I threw it later and he kept running past the five metres with the eyes of: ‘Mate, why are you not throwing the ball at me?’ And I went: ‘I don’t know.’ I felt like Eminem in 8 Mile when he chokes on stage with his rap.” Lawes’s continued absence is a cause for concern for player, club and for Jones, who has named nine front-row players in his 27-man squad, seemingly for added cover in the event of Covid complications when England are in Rome. With three of those set to drop out of the 23-man match-day squad, Chessum is set to come in. Joe Launchbury, who rejoined the squad on Monday, has returned to Wasps, while Tom Curry is set to continue as captain. In the backs, Jones has selected the same 10 who featured against Scotland as well as Newcastle’s Adam Radwan in what is shaping up to be a squad showing minimal changes from Murrayfield, blindside flanker notwithstanding. Italy have lost their last 33 Six Nations matches but Marler said: “It can be difficult. From personal experience it’s a little bit like you’re damned if you do, damned if you don’t. Particularly from fans and writers that go: ‘If you put 50 points on Italy well you’re expected to, if you only win by five points well you should have put 50 on them.’ So that’s a tricky one to manoeuvre.”",Sport/Sport,England’s Joe Marler says squad’s reaction helps deal with lineout error,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/09/englands-joe-marler-says-squads-reaction-helps-deal-with-lineout-error
2/10/2022,"Thousands of lives could be saved with a “promising” immunotherapy drug that can cut the risk of an aggressive form of breast cancer returning by more than a third, according to “exciting” results from a long-term global study. Keytruda, also known as pembrolizumab, uses the patient’s own immune system to fight cancer. The drug works by helping the immune system recognise and attack cancer cells, and is already used to treat lung cancer, skin cancer, bladder cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma. It is administered in a solution via a drip into the patient’s bloodstream, with the number of sessions depending on the type of cancer.  Now UK researchers have found that if given in combination with chemotherapy before surgery, and then again on its own after surgery, it can stop the disease coming back in women with triple-negative breast cancer, an aggressive type of the disease. The findings were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. In the Keynote-522 trial, women with early triple-negative breast cancer, where the disease had not yet spread beyond the breast and lymph nodes (stages two and three), were treated with Keytruda in addition to standard chemotherapy prior to surgery, followed by Keytruda after surgery. After a follow-up period of more than three years, experts led by Queen Mary University of London and Barts Health NHS trust found the risk of disease recurrence was 37% lower in patients treated with the drug combination than in those treated with chemotherapy alone. “We had previously demonstrated that the addition of immunotherapy to pre-operative chemotherapy increases the treatment response in patients with triple-negative breast cancer at the time of surgery,” said study lead Prof Peter Schmid, of Queen Mary and St Bartholomew’s hospital. “We now have long-term results demonstrating that the combination therapy significantly reduces recurrences by approximately 37%, including reduction of secondary breast cancer by 39%. “This means that the cure rate for these cancers is significantly increased. The estimates are that, just in the US where this treatment was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, this new treatment may save as many as 10,000 lives per year.” A total of 1,174 patients across 21 countries with previously untreated stage two or three triple-negative breast cancer were recruited for the trial, which was funded by the pharmaceutical company Merck Sharp & Dohme. The current standard of care for patients with early-stage triple-negative breast cancer is chemotherapy, which is typically used to shrink the tumour before surgery. More than 8,000 women in the UK are diagnosed with this form of breast cancer every year. “The risk of triple-negative breast cancer returning and spreading to other parts of the body in the first few years after treatment is higher than it is for other breast cancers,” said Dr Kotryna Temcinaite, of the charity Breast Cancer Now. “This promising new treatment could prevent more lives being lost to this devastating disease.”",News/Society,"Immunity-boosting breast cancer drug could save thousands, finds UK research",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/09/immunity-boosting-breast-cancer-drug-keytruda-could-save-thousands-finds-uk-research
2/10/2022,"Antonio Conte could hear the knock of opportunity. The Tottenham manager has been effective in beating the teams that his club would like and expect to beat, devouring the lower-hanging fruit, and Southampton had been cast as such – fairly or otherwise. With West Ham struggling to find their groove and Manchester United in profligate mood, the path towards a Champions League finish has been lit. And yet Spurs fluffed their lines. They would get nothing, which was what they deserved, in the first serious misstep of Conte’s Premier League tenure.  There was a point when Spurs looked as though they might get away with it. With Armando Broja lying stricken, having felt Emerson Royal jump all over him, Spurs moved forward through Harry Winks and Harry Kane and, when Lucas Moura crossed low, there was Son Heung-min to put them 2-1 up. Southampton refused to entertain the hard luck story. They had pummelled Spurs during the first-half, blowing a hatful of chances, Broja’s goal for 1-1 their only reward. Now they picked themselves up off the canvas again. The goals were provided by James Ward-Prowse with trademark whipped crosses and, with Spurs horribly static, failing to pick the runners, Mohammed Elyounoussi headed the equaliser and, moments later, Che Adams planted home the winner. There would almost be a late twist. Steven Bergwijn, whose stoppage-time goals had brought the outlandish comeback win at Leicester, had again entered as a substitute and again he found the net with the 90 minutes up, turning home after Cristian Romero had headed back Kane’s cross. VAR would spot that he was offside and Southampton could celebrate. Spurs had been frustrated in the league game at St Mary’s in late December, held to a 1-1 draw despite Southampton playing for 51 minutes with 10 men, and one of the big questions here was always going to be about their capacity to create. Ralph Hasenhüttl had started with three central defenders on that occasion. This time he went with his more favoured 4-2-2-2 system, and it was his team that looked the more cohesive in the first-half, finding space and time on the ball. And creating chances. Loads of them. However, they lacked a cutting edge before half-time, the tone set in by the big early chance that went begging. Mohamed Elyounoussi cut back to cross from the left and, when Ché Adams powered past Sergio Reguilón, he surely had to score. But the shot was too close to Hugo Lloris and the goalkeeper blocked. Spurs would blow a gilt-edged opportunity of their own before they went ahead. Conte’s idea was to finesse the offensive transitions, using the pace of Lucas Moura and Son and, after Cristian Romero had seen a header from a free-kick correctly ruled out for offside, Spurs snapped forward. Son fed Kane and nobody tracked the run of Reguilón. Kane went square and Reguilón had the freedom of the penalty area. His finish lacked guile, and was swatted straight at Fraser Forster, who saved. The opening goal was all about the speed and skill of Lucas, who accelerated before ushering Pierre-Emile Højbjerg up the inside right channel with the outside of his boot. Son darted to meet Højbjerg’s low cross but it was the outstretched leg of Jan Bednarek that diverted the ball past Forster for an own goal. Southampton’s response was excellent, and they deserved their equaliser through Armando Broja, who looks a rare prospect – strong and supremely assured on the ball and so dangerous with his quick feet. Yet Hasenhüttl had to be disappointed that his team were not ahead at the interval. There were a clutch of big chances that Southampton spurned after Broja’s equaliser, with the striker wasting the clearest one. He surged onto a Kyle Walker-Peters pass, breaking away from the dozing Davinson Sánchez, only to drag wide of the far post. Conte kicked a bucket of water in fury. Earlier, Stuart Armstrong had sent a free header towards the bottom corner, fully extending Lloris, and there would be various scrambles from corners just before the break. Mohammed Salisu saw a header hit Ben Davies and go just wide and, after Sanchez had cleared acrobatically from a Bednarek header, Romain Perraud sent a pile-driver from the edge of the box into the crossbar. Southampton could also point to a James Ward-Prowse shot that drew a fine save from Lloris and two efforts from Armstrong that flashed wide. Broja’s equaliser had been sparked by an unfortunate slip inside the area by Davies and then a failure to clear by Sánchez on the second phase. Perraud was allowed to pull back a low cross from the left by Royal and Broja, loosely marked, opened up his body to sidefoot home. There were loud boos from the home fans on the half-time whistle, and they craved greater clarity from their players upon the restart. Southampton’s hustle had knocked them from their stride. Kane almost provided it. When Reguilón stood up a cross to the far post, the striker ignored Emerson’s attempted volley in front of him – high boot and all – to head down and up towards goal, but the ball cleared the crossbar. Conte introduced the January signing, Rodrigo Bentancur, for his debut in central midfield and there were flashes of quality from him; the close control, the range of passing. Ever available, Bentancur brought the assurance that Spurs needed. The tide had turned. And Son’s goal looked to have bailed out his team. Southampton would dig deeper.",Sport/Football,Ché Adams seals it for Southampton after Tottenham twice lose their lead,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/09/tottenham-southampton-premier-league-match-report
2/10/2022,"Manchester City seem intent on making their title defence a procession. Their lead is now 12 points and though Liverpool can cut it back to nine by beating Leicester on Thursday, Pep Guardiola’s team have a relentlessness that may soon propel them far into the distance. Guardiola often speaks of the significance of how his side “arrive” in February, when the business phase of the campaign begins. On this evidence City are hitting their best rhythms with the spring months beckoning, precisely as he wishes.  Riyad Mahrez and Kevin De Bruyne were the scorers there, but it was another impressive all-round effort that will enthuse Guardiola, the master team-builder. This is City’s supreme strength: no single player is ever relied upon, as is underlined by the lack of a traditional No 9 being made a non-issue by Mahrez, Bernardo Silva and Raheem Sterling all contributing seven league goals. De Bruyne is next highest with six. Guardiola’s style is to talk up every opponent in quasi-awed terms, as if his team of A-list talents may struggle against them. This is often the precursor to them going out and giving them a schooling. So it was for their visitors on Wednesday night. At their best Brentford combine muscularity with neat movement in possession, but they were put in the role that so many before them have played in this stadium: unwilling ball-chasers pushed back to near their own area by City’s yo-yo-like ball retention. John Stones, stepping forward from right-back, prompted one move that involved Rodri, Sterling, and Riyad Mahrez before a corner was claimed. Next, though, João Cancelo had Guardiola rubbing his face – the Catalan’s “tell” that something is awry – after the left-back’s clumsy touch allowed Mads Roerslev to turn defence into attack down the right wing-back’s flank. Sterling next won a free-kick which resulted in another corner taken by Mahrez. Once again Brentford scrambled it clear only for the Algerian, moments later, to deliver another. All of this had David Raya’s goal resembling a dam City might burst imminently. Yet at the other end Mathias Jensen threatened to do exactly the same to the hosts, as a rare foray ended with a snap-shot that nearly beat Ederson. Sterling and Stones had replaced Jack Grealish and Kyle Walker, each of whom, according to Guardiola, had been “perfect” on the night out on Sunday, a video clip of which had gone viral and caused the manager to defend them. Mahrez, also present then, had been included in a team that was arguably full strength apart from the missing right-back and the former Aston Villa man. To reach the half-hour here and not concede is an achievement, though Brentford could be thankful that Cancelo blasted over from close range after Raya had parried a Mahrez cross-shot. This was followed by Phil Foden chipping a ball over traffic for Sterling, who missed narrowly with an acrobatic volley. De Bruyne’s free-kick then found Rúben Dias, who teed up Aymeric Laporte. The centre-back’s chest-down-and-shot was only marginally off-target. Dias’s next act was to give Ederson a scolding for not claiming the ball when rushing out: City’s captain hoofed clear, and the goalkeeper was informed that next time he should be given a shout. This was instantly forgotten, though, as City took the lead. A chief plank of Guardiola’s attack-play is a run along an inside channel of the area to panic defences. Sterling provided the threat, Roerslev fouled him, and Darren England awarded a spot-kick. It was the 23rd Premier League penalty Sterling had won, a record. Mahrez followed Saturday’s conversion against Fulham with an eighth consecutive success from the spot since missing against Liverpool four years ago. City, though, might have entered the dressing room with the scores level after a Stones slip had Rico Henry drawing a sharp save from Ederson. Brentford were still in the contest but City’s 74.5% first-half possession told the story of their challenge. And when Henry tapped the ball out for a corner, after which Cancelo let fly from 25 yards, it seemed the pattern would continue. The Portuguese’s effort drew Guardiola’s applause. A surge from Stones that evaded Brentford defenders, before he looked to slip in Mahrez, was also deserving of praise. So, too, Foden’s first-time pass to Sterling. City continued to purr, a whirl of movement in sky blue. Positions were interchanged, the ball swapped between them as if Brentford were training ground mannequins. Yet a slender lead holds no guarantees and suddenly Roerslev was teeing up Frank Onyeka. Only the powder-puff nature of his attempt prevented there being an equaliser. But disaster struck for Brentford when Raya steered a pass out straight to Sterling. The latter took aim and though the goalkeeper saved, De Bruyne made no mistake. Guardiola did a jig of delight – this, surely, was the win secured. He spent the remainder of the contest in the technical area to ensure there was no complacency from his men. That may be the only way of City fail to retain their crown. But Guardiola has them so well drilled it seems unlikely.",Sport/Football,Kevin De Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez help Manchester City breeze past Brentford,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/09/manchester-city-brentford-premier-league-match-report
2/10/2022,"New Zealand’s anti-vaccine protesters are being evicted from parliament grounds on the third day of their protest, with a number arrested after clashes with police. Police have brought in around 100 extra officers from around the country to try to clear the protesters from parliament grounds, where they had pitched tents and parked cars, blocking traffic.  The protesters, inspired by the “siege of Ottawa” where truckers paralysed the city and caused a state of emergency, led a convoy of several hundred vehicles to parliament on Tuesday. A number stayed overnight, pitching tents on the lawns. On Thursday morning, police launched an attempt to clear people from the parliament grounds. As the police line advanced forward, they clashed with protesters – initial reports indicate up to 20 people have been arrested after tussles with police. Wellington police district commander Superintendent Corrie Parnell said on Thursday morning that “police have appealed repeatedly to protesters to leave the grounds and have begun evicting people from the precinct”. “While police acknowledges people’s right to protest, this needs to be conducted in a way that does not unfairly impact on the wider public.” Most New Zealanders have supported the vaccine: 94% of those aged 12 and over are vaccinated with two doses. New Zealand has vaccine mandates that cover many workers in jobs designated “high contact” – including in healthcare, teaching, and the police. There are also vaccine requirements for other businesses including hospitality, gyms and hairdressers while the country is at a “red” or “orange” alert level. It is currently at red. The government estimates the mandates affect about 40% of the workforce. This week’s protest was purportedly to denounce those mandates – but its members are voicing a sprawling mixture of concerns, including about vaccine safety, a “plandemic”, concerns over gene therapy manipulation, accusations of media corruption, and requests to save a Northland oil refinery from closure. Over the past year, New Zealand’s anti-vaccine and anti-mandate protest movement has been increasingly home to conspiracy theories, threats and violent rhetoric, particularly against reporters, the prime minister, and other members of parliament. Calls for “citizens’ arrests”, “Nuremberg”-style trials, and for the execution of reporters and politicians have become commonplace in the movement’s social media pages and chat apps. At the current protest, some demonstrators decorated their vans with nooses, and scrawled “hang them high” on the parliament paving stones. The threat of that rhetoric exploding into violence was acknowledged by parliament and the country’s counter-terror services in November last year. Parliamentary services boosted security after a spate of threats or harassment of MPs. In January, prime minister Jacinda Ardern’s van was forced off the road and on to a curb after being pursued by anti-vaccine protesters yelling abuse. Ardern said on Thursday that it was time for protesters to move on. “I’m reminded that relative to the people that are at parliament now, on the very day that they’re there, tens of thousands of people went out and got vaccinated. It [the protest] is not reflective of where the rest of New Zealand is at right now. All of us want to actually move on.” She said the eviction of protesters was a police matter. “Every New Zealander has the right to protest – but when it tips into affecting business, people’s ability to move, and the ability of kids to go to school or emergency services to move around then obviously the police need to manage that,” she said. Parnell asked the public to avoid the area if possible, and said there would be traffic delays.",News/World news,New Zealand police clash with anti-vaccine protesters during eviction operation,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/10/new-zealand-police-clash-with-anti-vaccine-protesters-during-eviction-operation
2/10/2022,"The last time these two clubs met, 43 days ago, it seemed as if there was no hope for Norwich. But even if Dean Smith’s side could not make it a fourth successive victory following Teemu Pukki’s goal after just 39 seconds, there is still plenty of cause for optimism. Had Wilfried Zaha not fluffed his lines from the penalty spot moments after scoring a brilliant equaliser it could have ended up being a deeply frustrating night for Norwich’s manager that yielded nothing. Yet having survived a late onslaught from Patrick Vieira’s side, City have more than a glimmer of achieving what appeared to be the impossible this season.  Smith had warned Palace that they would be facing a team filled with renewed confidence six weeks on from a chastening defeat at Selhurst Park that Norwich’s manager admitted was “as low as we could have got”. Four wins from their next five matches in all competitions has brought renewed hope in this part of the world, even if Newcastle’s victory on Tuesday meant Norwich found themselves back in the relegation zone before kick-off. It did not take long for them to prove their manager right. Milot Rashica’s winner against Charlton in the FA Cup third round was the spark for Norwich’s revival and it was the Kosovo winger who created the quickest goal of the Premier League season so far with their first attack. Adam Idah’s touch to set up Pukki after controlling Rashica’s cross was exemplary, with the ball striking the post as it beat Vicente Guaita. Smith had made three changes from the side that beat Wolves in the FA Cup on Saturday, while Vieira selected Zaha for the first time since his red card against Spurs on Boxing Day. The Ivory Coast forward was rested at the weekend despite returning from the Africa Cup of Nations at the end of January, with Vieira urging him to show more consistency and “deliver more”. Yet while Jean-Philippe Mateta did manage to test Angus Gunn in the Norwich goal with an early effort, Zaha dragged his first sighter well wide of the target and was uncharacteristically slow to react to a couple of teasing balls from Michael Olise on the opposite flank. Pukki must then have thought he was going to score his second goal of the night on two occasions in the space of four minutes, only for Tyrick Mitchell to deny both efforts following more excellent play from Rashica that left Joel Ward bamboozled. Slowly, however, Palace began to find their rhythm and saw two penalty appeals correctly turned down by the referee Paul Tierney before Zaha took aim again and saw his shot deflect just wide of a post. Mateta thought he had drawn the visitors level just before the break after coming up with a clever dinked finish but was disappointed to see the flag raised for offside. With Manchester City and Liverpool up next, Norwich must have known this fixture represented their best opportunity to put points on the board as the season heads towards the run-in. Having weathered Palace’s early pressure, Rashica took it upon himself to try to extend their lead with an effort from 25 yards that whistled past the post. A strong right hand from Gunn was then required to stop Jeffrey Schlupp’s instinctive strike from the edge of the area after Norwich had failed to clear their lines at the other end. But there was not much the goalkeeper could have done about Zaha’s brilliant equaliser. Having cut an increasingly frustrated figure at the start of the second half, Palace’s talisman suddenly came alive on the hour mark as he left Przemyslaw Placheta in his wake before curling home from the edge of the box. Two minutes later Zaha had the ball on the penalty spot after Mitchell was brought down by a clumsy challenge from Max Aarons. The Ivorian seemed to slip at the crucial moment, however, and kicked the ball against his standing foot to let Norwich off the hook. Palace still looked the more likely to find a winning goal in the final stages, with Gunn forced to tip a defected shot from Will Hughes over the bar and then pushing Conor Gallagher’s low free-kick away to safety to ensure that Norwich will fight another day.",Sport/Football,Wilfried Zaha scores and misses penalty as Crystal Palace claim draw at Norwich,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/09/norwich-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report
2/10/2022,"The House select committee investigating the Capitol attack on Wednesday subpoenaed Donald Trump’s former White House senior adviser Peter Navarro, escalating its inquiry into the former president’s efforts to return himself to office and the January 6 insurrection. The move to pursue Navarro, who helped finalize the scheme to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s election win with political operatives at the Willard hotel in Washington DC, suggests the panel is edging ever closer to examining potential culpability for Trump.  Congressman Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the select committee, said in the subpoena letter to Navarro that House investigators wanted to depose him since he could potentially speak to what Trump knew in advance of plans to stop the certification on January 6. “Navarro appears to have information directly relevant to the select committee’s investigation,” Thompson said. “He hasn’t been shy about his role in efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election and has even discussed the former president’s support for those plans.” Thompson suggested in the letter that Navarro should be free to speak to the panel without concerns about executive privilege or other legal impediments, since he discussed the events of 6 January in his book In Trump Time, on his podcast and with reporters. The former White House adviser is of special interest to the panel, according to a source close to the investigation, as Navarro had the ear of the former president and, simultaneously, was in regular contact with the Willard operatives that formulated the plot. Navarro had been briefed by the Willard operatives – led by former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani and former Trump aide Steve Bannon – about their plan to have Mike Pence declare Trump the winner, or have the majority GOP delegation House vote for Trump in a contingent election. The Guardian first reported that after Trump was briefed on the scheme – which Navarro named the “Green Bay Sweep” – he told the Willard operatives just hours before the Capitol attack to find ways to stop Biden’s certification from happening. The former White House adviser also reported back to the Willard operatives on the morning of January 6 about the size of the pro-Trump crowds that would storm the Capitol later that afternoon, according to a former Trump official familiar with Navarro’s actions. As the select committee investigates whether Trump knew in advance of plans to violently stop Biden’s certification from taking place on January 6, Navarro could shed light on how much of the information he received from the operatives made it to Trump, the source said. The panel gave Navarro until 23 February to produce documents detailed in the subpoena, and ordered him to appear for a deposition on 2 March. It was not clear whether Navarro would cooperate; he did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",News/US news,Capitol attack inquiry narrows on Trump as panel subpoenas top aide,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/09/capitol-attack-inquiry-donald-trump-peter-navarro-subpoena
2/10/2022,"Wayne Rooney’s playing career is barely cold in the ground and now we have this official-version documentary profile. It could all be a little premature, as Rooney-the-manager looks as if he will be just as interesting as Rooney-the-player, if not (yet) so stellar. But his current travails at Derby County are no doubt too recent, and certainly not triumphal enough, to make the grade in a film designed to reboot the collective memory banks and secure his status as a footballing great. Despite his spectacular achievements – a boy wonder, leading goalscorer for both Manchester United and the England national team – Rooney was never exactly a glamorous figure, either on or off the pitch. This image was reinforced by a series of sleazy incidents that ensured he became grubby tabloid fodder. There is a strong element of reputational rehabilitation here, with lengthy sequences showing Rooney engaging in wholesome family activities, meekly accepting criticism from his wife Coleen, and interviews in which Rooney does his best to be frank. His natural defensiveness doesn’t help, though – along with his extensive deployment of the established footballers’ deflection technique of talking about themselves in the second and third person.  Still, Rooney isn’t shy of enlarging on his hardcase early teen years, and takes a public earbashing from Coleen over the tabloid escapades. (No mention of “Wagatha Christie”, though; no doubt that’s being saved for another documentary.) In fact, Rooney’s desire to bare his soul may yet get him into trouble, after he rather rashly admits to deliberately setting out to hurt an opponent in a key game against Chelsea – a remark in which the FA is taking an interest. The football, in truth, gets a little lost among all this: his international career was somewhat soured by the wider difficulties the England team experienced, and at club level, as he himself points out, his achievements at Manchester United were overshadowed by the treble-winners of 1999. Perhaps that will remain Rooney’s lot, even if it is clear his story is far from over.  Rooney is released on 11 February on Amazon Prime Video ",Arts/Film,Rooney review – reputation rehab for former boy wonder and his off-pitch antics,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/09/wayne-rooney-review-reputation-rehab-for-the-boy-wonder-and-his-off-pitch-antics
