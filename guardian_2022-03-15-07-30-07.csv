3/15/2022,"Game on. Pep Guardiola had warned earlier this month that Manchester City were enjoying a “fake lead” at the top and now their cushion will be cut to a single point if Liverpool win at Arsenal on Wednesday. The race is on and, should City blow it, they may look back on this as the occasion things turned. This was a rare off-night against an intelligent, punchy Crystal Palace side; City had the chances to win, especially during a purple patch in the first half, but came away goalless from an away fixture for the first time since the opening weekend defeat at Tottenham. It may cost them but anyone wanting a genuine contest over the season’s remainder will now feel enriched. The hope that Jürgen Klopp, presumably a more than interested spectator, could hold at the outset was that Palace had done a number on City before. Their 2-0 win at the Etihad in October, helped by Aymeric Laporte’s red card halfway through, was one of the last times the champions showed any significant weakness: City had only dropped five points since then, breeding little hope that lightning might strike twice. Nonetheless Palace showed an appetite to ask questions with some fierce pressing in the opening moments, led in particular by Conor Gallagher. It was the snappy Gallagher who, 10 minutes in, dispossessed Laporte and broke into space but overhit his pass left to an open Wilfried Zaha. City had probed in their standard fashion until then but, aside from a sublime first-time pass from Phil Foden that almost released Bernardo Silva, had not overly threatened to lock proceedings down early on. Instead they continued to struggle when harried. Zaha forced Kyle Walker into an error that allowed Jean-Philippe Mateta to feed Michael Olise, whose cross-shot with the outside of his left foot bent beyond the far post. Mateta had a shimmying run to the byline thwarted and another break, assisted by dizzying skill from Olise, was curtailed when he slipped. By the half’s midway stage, City’s only genuine opportunity had come from a Palace mistake: Vicente Guaita was fortunate, after spilling Kevin De Bruyne’s straightforward drive, to see Silva take too heavy a touch as he attempted to guide the loose ball past him. Guaita was more convincing when, following a signature chop inside and shot from Riyad Mahrez, he gathered comfortably. In the 26th minute his reactions were tested when De Bruyne stuck out a foot, attempting to guide João Cancelo’s perceptive pass over him. An outstretched hand flipped the ball over at close quarters but City, having rocked at times, were beginning to gain regular ground. They were within an upright’s width of making it count when Cancelo, taking aim from 25 yards after a corner had been worked out to him, crashed a fierce strike against Guaita’s right post. A more delicate connection from Laporte would have sent the rebound into the vacant goal but, as the ball sat up and arrived at pace, he skied over to jeers. It was still an excellent chance and Mahrez was next to receive a presentable opportunity, seeing Jack Grealish’s cutback reach him in the kind of position he enjoys but shooting straight at Guaita. A City opener was beginning to look inevitable. Palace were listing but regained some stability before the interval, Zaha shooting wide and Joachim Andersen teasing a delivery beyond lurking teammates. Mahrez shot wide and Klopp had cause for genuine optimism at half-time. Palace re-emerged with the same vim they showed early on. Six minutes into the second period, following a spell of pressure, Cheikhou Kouyaté glanced wide from in front of goal after Marc Guéhi’s header had given him the chance. Mateta, behind his right shoulder, might have been better positioned to score. Gallagher, effervescent in and out of possession, then took Palace 60 yards up the field and drew a foul from Grealish, who was booked. City had not got going, although a marginally offside De Bruyne struck the far post from an angle when they did construct something incisive. Guaita’s stupendous save from the rebound, blasted by Mahrez, proved immaterial. Patrick Vieira freshened up his front line, introducing Odsonne Édouard and Jordan Ayew for the tireless Matete and Olise; Palace remained full of running and, as the latter stages approached, looked perfectly worthy of the scoreline. Grealish, near the byline, gave Silva a chance to alter it with a perfectly-delivered centre but his teammate could not get adequate purchase. With nine minutes left, Édouard briefly appeared to have been released by Kouyaté but could not get a clean shot off; Zaha then warmed Ederson’s midriff as City left gaps with the minutes ebbing. Gallagher had a half-chance to win it in added time and, at the end, Liverpool wore the biggest grins of all.",Sport/Football,Crystal Palace frustrate Manchester City again to throw title race wide open,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/14/crystal-palace-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report

3/15/2022,"When the chatshow host Graham Norton published his debut novel, Holding, in 2016, the critical consensus was, in essence: “Ooh – this is rather good!” So, too, is its TV adaptation (ITV) of the same name, a compact four-parter by Dominic Treadwell-Collins and Karen Cogan, directed by Kathy Burke (yes, that Kathy Burke, in her first TV outing, after 20 years of successfully directing theatre productions in between entertaining us on screen). Burke says she agreed to break her rule of not taking on TV projects when she realised that she had read Norton’s book a year ago and could still remember the names of all the characters. I find this ridiculously heartwarming, possibly because of the unrelenting bleakness of the rest of the world. Holding is ostensibly a murder-mystery. Human remains are discovered in a small, quiet village in West Cork, Ireland, while local builders are demolishing a farmhouse that belonged to the Burke family. It seems that the villagers – including the fiancee jilted at the altar by Tommy, the son of the house, as well as the woman he was seeing on the side – now have an answer as to how, if not precisely why, he disappeared on his wedding eve 20 years ago. What it is really about, of course, is the discovery’s effect on the villagers and the gradual excavation of the inhabitants’ tangled histories and relationships – with Tommy, with each other and even with Ireland itself. Treadwell-Collins and Cogan have updated references to the country to include some of the progressive changes to its laws, while still appreciating that individual attitudes, especially beyond the cities, can take time to catch up. When Florence (Amy Conroy) and her girlfriend – Susan (Eleanor Tiernan), a teacher, who has left her husband– announce that they are moving to San Francisco, Florence’s sister Evelyn (whose selfishness is a defining characteristic) demands to know why, now that “Ireland’s the gayest place there is”. But Florence yearns for somewhere that she, Susan and Susan’s 17-year-old son, Stephen (Sky Yang), won’t be greeted with “Little gay family!” by regulars in the pub, however kindly meant. The attractions of emigration are heightened when she finds out that Evelyn (Charlene McKenna) is shagging Stephen. Evelyn, who was Tommy’s bit on the side, really is a thoughtless piece of work. Tommy’s former fiancee – in the eyes of some villagers, for ever his fiancee – Bríd (Siobhán McSweeney, reminding us of her dramatic chops after two glorious series playing Sister Michael in Derry Girls), is a secret alcoholic. Or, at least, as secret an alcoholic as you can be in rural Ireland. Everyone knows, but occasionally they refrain from mentioning it. There are hints that she knows more about Tommy’s disappearance than she has let on. Maybe her quietly resentful husband and casually cruel mother do, too. There is nothing madly innovative here. The local garda, PJ (Conleth Hill), is a slow-moving man who accepted a post in the village a few years ago, possibly in retreat from life generally or some more specific sorrow, and soon finds himself at the beck and call of a much younger, brasher detective (Clinton Liberty), who is up from Dublin to investigate. Detective Dunne scandalises the locals to a degree they most certainly enjoy, with his disrespect for mass and an exhumation of the Burke parents’ bodies to glean DNA to compare with the remains. There is a village busybody by the name of Mrs O’Driscoll (Pauline McLynn, playing a naturalistic version of her Mrs Doyle from Father Ted), who adds vim and vigour to proceedings wherever she goes, and a doughty housekeeper, Mrs Meaney (Brenda Fricker), who is all but guaranteed to be a repository of all the secrets of the village since time immemorial (and a plot engine as efficient as her potato scone-making). Nevertheless, it neatly avoids cliche and Oirishness. It has genuine charm, which is to say it is suffused with wit, warmth and compassion. Perhaps because it is a drama centred on people who are middle-aged and above – the mistakes they have made, the things they have hidden over a lifetime and the warping that has happened around them – it feels real and has an undertow of melancholy, if not outright sadness. There is an absolutely wonderful sex scene in episode two that sums up exactly what I mean and marks this out as a hidden gem.",Arts/Television & radio,Holding review – a charming adaptation of Graham Norton’s novel,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/14/holding-review-a-charming-adaptation-of-graham-nortons-novel
3/15/2022,"With the final weekend of the 2022 Six Nations looming and England struggling to avoid finishing in the bottom half of the table, you can only marvel at Eddie Jones’s relentless chutzpah. In the head coach’s view it is grand slam-chasing France who have most to ponder currently, with his side intent on exploiting the gaps in their hosts’ armour in Paris on Saturday. Given England lost the try count 4-0 against Ireland last weekend and were beaten at Twickenham by a record margin under Jones, the truth is that far wider cracks are threatening to open up closer to home. As so often, though, Jones is much keener to discuss potential opposition frailties than to consider the implications of another heavy England defeat. The problem is that almost no one is buying his calculated dummies nowadays. If the valour and spirit shown by a 14-man England in losing to Ireland was admirable, it is the outcome and shape of Saturday’s game that will ultimately determine whether or not Jones is merely whistling in the wind. The 62-year-old has at least been around the block frequently enough in both hemispheres to know that agreeing to serve a second World Cup cycle, having not won in 2019, was always an all-or-nothing assignment. “The longer you’re in the job, the more people probably don’t want you to be in the job,” he told BBC 5 Live. “I don’t think it helps being an Australian but that’s part of the deal. When I decided to do another cycle, I knew that would be more intense.” Most England fans would counter that Jones’s nationality matters less than his continuing ability to assemble a team that makes its most striking statements on the field. Having scored only two tries in three games against Scotland, Wales and Ireland, there are also those wondering if England’s idea of heading to Paris early this week to aid their acclimatisation for next year’s World Cup knockout phase is a shade presumptuous. While Jones remains adamant England played “exceptionally well” against Ireland for 60 minutes, he also knows that a French defence organised expertly by Shaun Edwards will be even harder to pierce. Having seen Wales bother Les Bleus both at the line-out and with their aerial game in Cardiff, however, he is hoping that England can do likewise. “One thing I know is that there’s not a team in the world or in the history of the game that does not have a chink in their armour,” said Jones. “Every team has a chink. It is your ability to find and expose that chink which is going to be the key on Saturday.” “France are the longest kicking team in the world so that battle of the kicks is obviously important. They get their field position by kicking and we’ll need to take that strength away from them. The line-out battle against France is also an interesting one. Whether they bring in another jumper we’ll just have to wait and see but it will be a key contest in the game.” With flanker Tom Curry ruled out with a torn hamstring, Jones has invited Wasps’ Jack Willis to train with the squad for the first time since the latter’s serious knee injury against Italy at Twickenham just over a year ago. “He had a tough old injury but he has recovered well, has shown a great amount of resilience and we’re looking forward to seeing where he’s up to in terms of his international career,” said Jones. The head coach also indicated Courtney Lawes would probably stay at blindside flanker, which suggests Joe Launchbury is poised to replace Charlie Ewels in the second-row alongside Maro Itoje, England’s player of the championship to date. “Maro Itoje is going to another peak,” said Jones. “He climbed Everest as a young player and he looks like he’s going to climb another Everest as a maturing player.” France, meanwhile, welcome back Damian Penaud and Romain Taofifénua after they missed the Wales match with Covid. Yoram Moefana is out with a knee injury and has been replaced by Tani Vili. For the other match that could decide the destination of the Six Nations title this weekend, Ireland have lost Ryan Baird and James Ryan for their game against Scotland with Joe McCarthy and Ross Molony called up to their training squad as cover.",Sport/Sport,Eddie Jones focuses on France’s flaws despite England cracks widening,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/14/eddie-jones-focuses-on-frances-flaws-despite-england-cracks-widening
