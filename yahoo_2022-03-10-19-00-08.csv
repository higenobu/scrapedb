A video that captured what appears to be Chinese health workers bludgeoning a quarantined woman’s pet to death has gone viral in China.

In a Weibo post on March 4, pet owner Yi Zhi Xue Qiu of the city of Huizhou in Guangdong Province accused the health officials of beating her 3-year-old dog Snowball to death. She posted CCTV footage of the incident prove her accusation.

Qiu was reportedly sent to a quarantine facility on March 2 after her boyfriend tested positive for COVID-19.

According to Qiu, she was forced to leave Snowball since she could not bring any pets with her. She was informed that health workers would disinfect her apartment while she was away.



In the video she shared on Weibo, two workers in protective gear can be seen carrying metal rods and approaching a barking, frightened dog, who attempts to back away. It did not take long for the workers to subdue the small animal by beating it several times with their rods. They immediately leave the room after killing Qiu’s dog.

In her post, Qiu also shared screenshots of her conversation with the workers. She had told them about Snowball, letting them know that the dog was not aggressive and would not cause them any harm.

""Snowball is like family to me,” she wrote in Chinese. “Without this CCTV evidence, we might still be deceived that our pet was 'humanely' put down. I was told by anti-epidemic officials that they would just be disinfecting my home, not killing my dog. Who gave them the right to do that? I also applied and pleaded for the dog to just be sent into quarantine with me, but no one gave me that chance.”

Qiu lamented that she and her boyfriend mourned their dog’s untimely death, spending the past days “in endless regrets and pains.”

“We raised a dog together for three years and three months,” she added. “It was already part of our family, but now he died tragically in his own home.""

An official statement from local authorities acknowledged the incident and noted that the health officials have been suspended.

""We have apologized to the dog owner and will counsel and suspend the workers,"" the statement read.

Qiu’s post has sparked anger among social media users, with many calling for justice over Snowball’s death. Chinese tech influencer Naomi Wu was among those who called for the incarceration of the workers.
  Jail- that's it. Names, pictures, jail. No vague assurances of justice. Jail and specific legal protection for pets. No one is going to quarantine without a fight if you are going to murder our pets you suck fucks. You will lose to the pandemic because no one will cooperate.  — Naomi Wu 机械妖姬 (@RealSexyCyborg) March 5, 2022    ""Jail- that's it.

In November, a pet corgi was similarly killed in China’s Jiangxi Province after its owner was sent to a quarantine facility. Local officials explained that the killing was part of an effort to “thoroughly disinfect” houses amid the rise of COVID-19 cases in the area.     Featured Image via 有只雪球 Enjoy this content?

3/10/2022,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine would help bring the conflict there to a faster conclusion and save lives, the Polish ambassador to Kyiv said on Thursday, as Russia continued a relentless bombardment of several cities. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been pleading for NATO to impose a no-fly zone, but the alliance is wary of any step that might draw it into direct conflict with Russia. ""Every day of delay costs hundreds of human lives,"" Bartosz Cichocki told private broadcaster TVN24 from Kyiv. ""This is an extension of the conflict that could be ended much faster precisely thanks to the closure of the airspace."" The United States on Tuesday rejected a surprise offer by Poland to transfer its Russian-made MiG-29 fighter jets to a U.S. base in Germany and put them at the disposal of the United States as a way to replenish Ukraine's air force. Poland's prime minister said on Wednesday that any supply of fighter jets to Ukraine must be done jointly by NATO countries.

3/10/2022,"On Hannity Wednesday, Fox News National Security Correspondent Jennifer Griffin appeared where she addressed recent Russian propaganda. Russia has recently claimed that the U.S. is running secret bioweapon labs in Ukraine. “In terms of Ukraine’s biolabs, which have come under scrutiny tonight,” Griffin said, “those are Soviet-era bio-labs that the U.S. has been engaged [with] since 2005 in trying to help Ukraine convert the research facilities safely.” Griffin spoke of the concern among some U.S. officials that Russia is doing this now as a pretext to their own use of these types of weapons as their invasion of Ukraine continues. “White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Moscow’s talk today about these biolabs has led to concern by U.S. intelligence,” Griffin said, “that Russia could use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine to create a false flag operation using them.” Griffin’s reporting on the matter differed greatly from what opinion host Tucker Carlson said on his show an hour earlier. Carlson, who has been accused on multiple occasions of pushing Russian propaganda, used the admission by Under Secretary of State Victoria Nuland that there are biological research labs in Ukraine as a reason to push the same narrative as Russia. “Ukraine is the poorest country in Europe,” Carlson said. “It’s hardly a hotbed of biomedical research. We’re assuming these weren’t pharmaceutical labs. Probably not developing new leukemia drugs. From your answer, Victoria Nuland, we would assume, because you all but said it, there’s a military application of this research. They’re working on bioweapons.” But Griffin said that the knowledge of these labs is neither secret nor new. “It is a long program that has existed, where the Pentagon has partnered with these biolabs,” Griffin said, adding, “The U.S. has been very open about its involvement there with that. But what Russia does is they take that information, distort it, turn it around and turn it into disinformation.” JENNIFER GRIFFIN: In terms of Ukraine's bio labs which have come under scrutiny tonight, those are Soviet-era biolabs that the US has been engaged since 2005 in trying to help Ukraine convert the research facilities safely. KYLIE MAR: Jennifer Griffin, a national security correspondent at Fox News, appeared on ""Hannity"" Wednesday, where she addressed recent Russian propaganda claiming that the US has secret bioweapons labs in Ukraine. US officials fear that Russia is making this claim as a pretext to their own use of these types of weapons as their invasion of Ukraine continues. JENNIFER GRIFFIN: White House press Secretary Jen Psaki said Moscow's talk today about these biolabs has led to concern by US intelligence that Russia could use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine to create a false flag operation using them. KYLIE MAR: Griffin's reporting of the Russian claims stood in sharp contrast to what opinion host Tucker Carlson said on his show an hour earlier. Carlson, who has been accused of pushing Russian propaganda on multiple occasions, not only played a clip of a Russian official making the claim but baselessly propagated the Russian message. TUCKER CARLSON: Ukraine is the poorest country in Europe. It's hardly a hotbed of biomedical research. We're assuming these weren't pharmaceutical labs. Probably not developing new leukemia drugs. From your answer, Toria Nuland, we would assume because you all but said it that there is a military application to this research, that they were working on bioweapons.

3/10/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) - Sergei Chemezov, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, said that the military operation in Ukraine had prevented an attack on Russia, which he said would emerge victorious from the sanctions imposed by the West. Putin says the ""special military operation"" is essential to ensure Russian security after the United States enlarged the NATO military alliance to Russia's borders and supported pro-Western leaders in Kyiv. Ukraine says it is fighting for its existence and the United States, and its European and Asian allies have condemned the Russian invasion. Russia's economy is facing the gravest crisis since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union after the West imposed heavy sanctions on almost the entire Russian financial and corporate system following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. ""If you glance at Russia's history, almost all of that history Russia has battled with different sanctions, with enemies which encircled her, and she always came out as the victor,"" Rostec CEO Chemezov told staff. ""Now will be the same."" Chemezov is influential in Russia: he worked as a KGB spy with Putin in East Germany before the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. ""It won't be a simple life,"" Chemezov said, according to a video of his remarks sent by Rostec. ""The sanctions are rather serious."" But he cast the invasion as a necessary act to prevent a strike against the Russian-backed regions of eastern Ukraine and then on Russia itself. Chemezov said the sanctions would allow Russia to develop internally. Rostec is one of Russia's state corporations with interests in weapons, aircraft engineering, radioelectronics, medical technologies, innovative materials. Its assets include AvtoVAZ, KAMAZ, UAC, Russian Helicopters, UEC, Uralvagonzavod, Shvabe and Kalashnikov.

3/10/2022,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -A senior member of Russia's ruling party has proposed nationalising foreign-owned factories that shut down operations in the country over what the Kremlin calls a special military operation in Ukraine. Several foreign companies including Ford and Nike have announced temporary shutdowns of stores and factories in Russia in order to put pressure on the Kremlin to stop its invasion of neighbouring Ukraine and as their supply chains are disrupted. In a statement published on Monday evening on the United Russia website, the secretary of the ruling party's general council Andrei Turchak said shutting operations was a ""war"" against the citizens of Russia. The statement mentioned Finnish privately owned food companies Fazer, Valio and Paulig as the latest to announce closures in Russia. ""United Russia proposes nationalising production plants of the companies that announce their exit and the closure of production in Russia during the special operation in Ukraine,"" Turchak said. ""This is an extreme measure, but we will not tolerate being stabbed in the back, and we will protect our people. This is a real war, not against Russia as a whole, but against our citizens,"" he said. ""We will take tough retaliatory measures, acting in accordance with the laws of war,"" Turchak said. Paulig Chief Executive told Reuters in an email this would not change its plans to withdraw from Russia. Fazer and Valio did not wish to comment when contacted by Reuters. Fazer, which makes chocolate, bread and pastries, has three bakeries in St Petersburg and one in Moscow, employing around 2,300 people. Valio has a cheese factory and employs 400 people in Russia, and Paulig has a coffee roastery and employs 200 people in the country. Last week, non-NATO member Finland, which shares a border with Russia, agreed to strengthen security ties with the United States as it nervously watches Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
