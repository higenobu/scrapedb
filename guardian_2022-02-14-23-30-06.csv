2/14/2022,"An opera score retrieved from a San Francisco basement has had its world premiere in a German theatre, exuberantly brought to life by more than 150 musicians and performers nearly 80 years after its composer was murdered by the Nazis. Grete Minde, a late-romantic opera of 1920s jazz-inspired melodies and large orchestral sounds, was the work of Eugen Engel, a Berlin-based Jewish textile tradesman in his day job, who gave his handwritten sheet music to his daughter for safekeeping when she escaped to the United States in 1941.  He waited in vain for permission to follow her but was killed in Sobibor concentration camp on 26 March 1943, at the age of 67, after his arrest in Amsterdam. “We kept his papers in a trunk for years but it was too painful for my mother to take them out, so we never really engaged with them, though I always knew there was an opera score there,” said Jan Agee, Engel’s granddaughter. She didn’t realise their significance until after her mother Eva’s death in 2006, when she was contacted by the Jewish Museum Berlin looking for documents for its archives. Agee travelled with her brother and daughter from California to eastern Germany and the Theater Magdeburg for the first live performance of Grete Minde, a rousing spectacle that veers between comedy and tragedy and has left critics full of praise. “It has everything you may wish from an opera, involving the entire ensemble, a heart-stopping storyline touching on the dream of a better, fairer life versus the dogma and bigotry of bourgeois society, accompanied with gorgeous sounds and catchy rhythms,” wrote Die Zeit’s music critic Hannah Schmidt. Talking backstage after the performance, which received standing ovations, Megan Agee, Engel’s great-granddaughter said: “It is quite overwhelming to have these written words and notes which have been dormant for so long brought to life. It’s like Eugen Engel planted a seed back then but until it was performed we did not know exactly what that was. We are amazed and grateful for the abundance of what has emerged.” Her uncle Claude Lowen, Engel’s 84-year-old grandson, said: “These musicians today are giving voice to my grandfather as well as to all the many other musicians who were murdered, many cut off before they were able to show their full potential.” The opera has further performances in Magdeburg in February and March and the family said they were hopeful it would be performed elsewhere around the world, with several concert venues having already reached out to the German theatre. Jan Agee, 74, said her mother never got over the feeling she had “left her father behind”. She said: “She had an upright piano waiting for him for when he would finally arrive in the United States. But he never did, and it was her greatest wish to have his music performed. My biggest regret is that she is no longer here to experience this.” Anna Skryleva, a Russian conductor who became the general music director of Theater Magdeburg in 2019, first became interested in Engel at a performance of some of his works at the unveiling of a brass plaque engraved with brief details about his life and death. The stolperstein, or “stumbling stone”, is set in the pavement of Charlottenstrasse 74, his Berlin address, which was destroyed in a bombing raid. She took a copy of the piano arrangement of the opera home and played it. “I was immediately captured,” she said. “It is replete with interesting harmonious expressions and stylistic phrases. I was struck by its touches of Wagner, Strauss and Korngold, by the confidence of a layperson to write such an ambitious work.” The musicians – a large ensemble including an organ, two harps, strings and brass, a female choir and solo singers – were enthusiastic supporters of the project, Skryleva said. “We are all at great pains to do Engels justice, seeing him as representative of the many composers we never got to know.” Little is known of Engels’ life or how he taught himself to compose. His wider body of work includes chamber music, lieder and quartets. Working on the opera was a sideline as he earned money as a buyer of fabric for women’s coats on behalf of a large Berlin department store. He was friends with leading musicians in Berlin including the composer Engelbert Humperdinck and the conductors Bruno Walter and Leo Blech, as recorded in extensive letters between them found in the trunk. Engels would trawl music shops with his daughter and regularly took scores with him to study line by line during opera concerts. The dozens of letters on thin paper that he sent to his daughter after she went to the USremain among the family’s most precious possessions. “He typed them; then, when he was forbidden from buying typewriter ribbon, he continued them by hand,” Agee said. In the last one, via the Red Cross, dated 20 March 1943, he wrote: “My dear children, I am healthy and well and think of you often.” Skryleva and Ulrike Schröder, Theater Magdeburg’s chief dramatic adviser, oversaw the painstaking transcription by external experts of more than 40 individual voice and instrument parts, making use of the shutdown during the pandemic to do so. The entire production cost more than €110,000 to stage. “We believe he spent almost 20 years composing the opera, working on it in his spare time,” said Schröder, who has attempted to piece together as much of Engel’s life as possible. “The libretto was written in 1914 and this might have been the starting point.” By the time he’d finished the opera in 1933, the Nazis were in power, but he kept trying to get it on stage even as his life was in danger. “Even if he hadn’t been Jewish it would have been hard for him to get it on the stage as a non-professional, but the rise of Hitler made it absolutely impossible,” Schröder said. Engels was one of about 13 siblings, most of whom are thought to have been murdered by the Nazi regime. But Schröder said she would be cautious about reading too much into Engels’ choice of source material – Grete Minde, by the writer Theodor Fontane, which is based on the true 16th-century story of a young woman who is deprived of her rightful inheritance by officials in her home town and takes her revenge by setting fire to it and burning to death herself and her child. Nevertheless, she said, a modern audience watching as the town goes up in flames would not be able to avoid drawing parallels between the fate of Grete Minde, who is treated as an outsider, and the decimation of the Jews.",News/World news,Holocaust victim’s opera stored for years in trunk gets premiere at last,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/14/holocaust-victims-opera-stored-for-years-in-trunk-gets-premiere-at-last
2/14/2022,"This May, the Queen will celebrate 70 years in office, her platinum jubilee. She is already the longest-serving British ruler and, by then, will be second only to Louis XIV among European monarchs. Such longevity in office is phenomenal and will merit national congratulation and celebration. The Queen has performed her duty of symbolising the British nation over an extraordinary era, from the end of empire, through joining and leaving the European Union, to a global technological revolution. She has known 14 prime ministers, from Winston Churchill to Boris Johnson. Though her “rule” is powerless and largely ritualised, she has performed with energy and dignity. She has steered her office away from controversy, and retained a sincere public affection. Given her bizarre occupation, she has been well-cast.  Today, age and the pandemic have forced the Queen to withdraw from ever more royal duties and public engagements, most conspicuously the recent Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow. She has indicated that she will join in this summer’s jubilee celebrations and will be applauded for doing so. But there already appears a sort of finality to that event, coming as it does with her now being 95 years old. The Prince of Wales is taking on ever more of the burdens of office. The Queen may be fit, but she is clearly delicate. Any reasonable person would recommend retirement from active work for a woman of her age. Yet none in royal circles dares breathe the word abdication – a concept toxic to the royal family since Edward VIII’s enforced departure in 1936. It is accepted that serious incapacity might require the Prince of Wales to be made “regent”, though the confusions of regency under George III make it hardly appealing. Besides, if the prince is going to act as king for the remainder of his mother’s life, there seems little point in not crowning him. The Queen has attributed her intention to continue in office throughout her life to the significance of her coronation “anointment”. According to the royal expert Hugo Vickers, this results from her alleged pact with God: “If you are an anointed queen you do not abdicate.” A poll at the time of the Queen’s coronation in 1953 reported that “three out of 10 people believed she could claim direct descent from God”. There is no constitutional basis for this. Popes are likewise supposed not to abdicate, but Benedict XVI retired in 2013. The monarchs of the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Japan, among others, have all given way to younger successors in the past decade. Monarchy is not a human attribute but a constitutional function, in which one person performs the rites of statehood emphatically detached from political partisanship. It is an arbitrary convenience. That this person should be chosen by birth and religion is inherently absurd, but that is a relic of history and one that has served surviving monarchies well. It suggests a people secure enough in their democracy – and impotent enough in their monarchy – to have escaped the turmoil of republican revolution. The world’s most stable and progressive countries – such as Sweden, Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands – have hereditary monarchies. They are not stable because they are monarchies; they are monarchies because they are stable. Nor can the folksy language of deference and hierarchy be said seriously to stifle Britain. Tourists love it. Nonetheless, the prospect now is of a prolonged period in which the person embodying the British state cannot fulfil the functions of office, while the country waits in possibly prolonged suspense. In Queen Victoria’s old age this meant constant rumour, uncertainty, feuding courtiers and an ill-planned ceremonial. It was a period of intense gloom. The death of a monarch in office also has to embrace the contortion of national grief overlaid with subsequent joyous coronation. Monarchy’s most articulate analyst, Vernon Bogdanor, has argued that its “mystique and magic”, even if shorn of power, can rely for its legitimacy only on public opinion. It has no accountability to parliament or election, but depends instead on “the practical employment of its symbolic influence”. This means the personality of the monarch and their ability to conduct the necessary rituals to public satisfaction. The Queen and Prince Philip decided in the 1960s not to seek the anonymous security of the so-called “cycling monarchies” of Scandinavia. They focused a spotlight on the heredity principle in refashioning the crown as a family, satirised as “the firm”. Their extended offspring became the world’s most celebrated royals, their every move predictably recorded by an ever more fascinated media. This was and remains high risk. As was found during the divorce and death of Diana, Princess of Wales, it left the royal family vulnerable to mass public opinion. This is currently in decline. While a steady two-thirds of the British public still favour monarchy, that is by no means everyone. The longstanding Ipsos Mori survey shows its popularity sliding in just a decade from near 80% in 2012 to 60% at present. Hence the palace’s hypersensitivity to the media glare that has visited the allegations against Prince Andrew and the high-profile departure of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex from the family. The crown has rescued itself from such mishaps in the past, but it has done so largely through the personality of the Queen in drawing on deep reserves of personal affection. After her death, this will be extremely hard for the Prince of Wales to regenerate. The moment of transition to any new monarch, not least after 70 years, must be one of intense delicacy. Nothing could therefore more aid Prince Charles in his succession than for it to be a planned transfer on the retirement of his mother and her blessing on his coronation. She has broken nearly all records for time in office. She has prepared the way for the Duchess of Cornwall to become queen. Charles has reportedly committed himself to Buckingham Palace. A retirement in good health, like that of Beatrix of the Netherlands in 2013, a retreat to Windsor and Charles’s coronation would be a dignified and happy occasion. It would celebrate British monarchy not as a ritual of death and rebirth, but as a simple facet of the constitution. It would also relieve Charles of a deluge of comparison, especially if he decides on changes in royal custom and practice, as well he should. Whatever is wrong with British politics just now, the monarchy cannot be blamed. At least Britain is avoiding the US’s current agonies of state. But monarchy’s stability depends on public favour. That favour can never be taken for granted. The Queen’s early retirement should be seen not as an “abdication”, but as prudent, considerate common sense.

2/14/2022,"Threats to an American agricultural inspector in the Mexican state of Michoacán caused the US to suspend imports of avocados from its neighbor, officials said, disrupting a $2.4bn industry during one of its busiest times of the year. Mexico’s department of agriculture said in a statement that the inspector received a threatening message on his cellphone, prompting the ban on avocado exports to the US “until further notice.”  The US agricultural department (USDA) has not confirmed the move, but warned after an incident in 2019, in which a team of US inspectors was reportedly robbed by a gang at gunpoint, that further threats would prompt an immediate cessation of “program activities.” Michoacan is the only state in Mexico with a license to export avocados to the US, and the Mexican growers and packers association says its members are a frequent target of violence and threats from organized crime groups seeking protection money.In 2020, the most recent year for which figures are available, Mexico exported almost 965 metric tons (2.1m pounds) of avocados to the US, a 7% increase on the previous year as demand for guacamole and other avocado products increased. Mexico announced the USDA’s decision the night before the Super Bowl in Los Angeles, traditionally one of the biggest days of avocado consumption of the year, although produce used this year was exported several weeks before the game. The inspector who was threatened was part of a team working for the USDA’s animal and plant health inspection services department, according to the Associated Press. The US lifted a three-year ban on Mexican avocados in 1997 after an inspection deal was struck to try to prevent weevils, scabs and other pests from entering orchards.",News/World news,US halts avocado imports from Mexico after threat to American inspector,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/14/us-avocado-imports-mexico-threats
2/14/2022,"Spain’s far-right Vox party is pushing for a place in the new regional government of Castilla y León following a snap election that has proved a tactical misstep for the ruling conservative People’s party (PP). The PP called Sunday’s vote in the hope of securing an absolute majority after spending three years governing the region in partnership with the centre-right Citizens party.  But the move backfired. Although the PP finished first, taking 31.4% of the vote and 31 seats in the 81-seat regional parliament, it did not attract enough support to govern alone. The Spanish Socialist Workers' party (PSOE), came second with 30% of the vote and 28 seats, while Vox took third place with 17.6% and saw its seat count rise from one to 13. The far-right grouping’s strong showing casts it in the role of kingmaker for any future PP administration. In the past it has cut deals to help the PP into office in Madrid, Andalucía and Murcia, but this time it is demanding a place in a coalition government. “Vox has the right and the duty to form a government in Castilla y León,” Vox’s leader, Santiago Abascal, told a political rally on Sunday night. The PP’s regional leader, Alfonso Fernández Mañueco, said he would begin speaking to other parties about forming a new government in Castilla y León. “I will speak with everyone to form a government of everyone and for everyone,” he said. The national PP, however, appears less keen on a deal with Vox. “The coalition government’s we’ve seen so far – including the national government [of the PSOE and Unidas Podemos] – haven’t been satisfactory,” said the party’s general secretary, Teodoro García Egea. An alliance with Vox would prove uncomfortable for the PP’s national leader, Pablo Casado. Despite rounding on Vox in October 2020 – when he accused the party of practising a politics based on “fear, anger, resentment and revenge” – Casado has dragged the PP further to the right to stop voters abandoning the party in favour of Vox. The results in Castilla y León will also give the PP pause for thought as it reflects on its strategy in both the looming regional election in Andalucía and next year’s general election.",News/World news,Spain’s far-right Vox party demands place in Castilla y León government,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/14/spain-far-right-vox-party-demand-place-castilla-y-leon-government-peoples-party-snap-election-backfires
2/14/2022,"Boris Johnson cut short his UK tour on Monday to return to London as western leaders voiced concerns a Russian invasion of Ukraine could happen imminently, and Liz Truss convened a Cobra meeting to discuss the UK’s consular response. The foreign secretary will consider whether to change advice to UK diplomats in the country, after it issued new guidance on Friday advising British citizens in Ukraine to leave immediately while commercial flights are still available.  Number 10 said Johnson would receive an intelligence briefing on his return to London, having been due to visit Cumbria, and will convene another full Cobra meeting on Tuesday. Speaking on a visit to Scotland, Johnson said he would be making immense diplomatic efforts over the coming days including liaising with the US president, Joe Biden. He said that Ukraine’s future membership of Nato could not be “bargained away” as part of western leaders’ efforts. “I think it’s very important that we have a conversation, but what we can’t do is trade away the sovereign rights of the Ukrainians who aspire to Nato membership,” he said. “That’s something that was a massive gain for our world. If you remember what happened in 1990, you had a Europe whole and free, countries could decide their own futures. We can’t bargain that away. It’s for the Ukrainian people.” Parliament could be recalled if Russia invades Ukraine this week, Number 10 indicated. Asked if this was a possibility, the PM’s official spokesman said: “In that situation you would expect that the prime minister would want parliament to be updated and for it to have its say.” Johnson’s spokesman said there was no indication at the moment that diplomatic efforts would halt the invasion. “It’s certainly true that we have seen no sign so far that Russia will back down. There are more than 130,000 Russian troops on the border with Ukraine and we are gravely concerned. But we will continue to explore every possible avenue to talk Russia back from this path.” The UK ambassador to Ukraine, Melinda Simmons, had said she will remain in Kyiv with a core team of diplomats. Many western nations have advised their citizens to evacuate. The US and Canadian embassies have told non-essential staff and family members to return home while others will work from the western Ukrainian city of Lviv. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, visited Kyiv on Monday and will travel to Moscow on Tuesday, warning that an attack by Russia would lead to “tough sanctions that we have carefully prepared and which we can immediately put into force”. Downing Street said British nationals should not expect a “military airlift” from Ukraine. “British nationals should leave Ukraine via commercial means and there are still flights available,” Johnson’s spokesman said.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson to chair Cobra meeting on Ukraine crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/14/boris-johnson-to-chair-cobra-meeting-on-ukraine-crisis
2/14/2022,"The major buy now, pay later companies Clearpay, Klarna, Laybuy and Openpay have agreed to change “potentially unfair and unclear” terms and conditions after an intervention from the financial regulator. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it was able to use consumer law to enforce the changes. However, the regulator acknowledged that it was still lacking the powers to regulate the sector to the same standard as other consumer credit companies.  The companies were made to change contract terms on cancellations and continuous payment authority to make them “fairer and easier to understand”, the FCA said. Clearpay, Laybuy and Openpay also agreed to refund some late payment fees they had wrongly charged after customers cancelled orders. The use of buy now, pay later (BNPL) has exploded in recent years, with an FCA review last year finding that the UK market had trebled in size in 2020 alone, even as other forms of short-term consumer credit such as payday lending fell back after being forced to improve their consumer protections. The market is worth an estimated £6.4bn a year in the UK, according to the consultancy firm Bain & Company, and is used by about 10 million shoppers. The government is considering bringing in new rules for the sector but has yet to detail what action it will take. BNPL services are usually offered at the point of sale online, allowing shoppers to pay in instalments. Unlike payday lenders or credit cards, BNPL lenders typically do not charge interest on loans, meaning they avoid current regulations. Retailers instead pay the companies fees. The rapid growth – and the prospect of lending platforms spreading to retailers around the globe – has helped BNPL companies to huge valuations usually enjoyed by Silicon Valley tech companies rather than consumer credit firms. The Swedish company Klarna was valued at $45bn in a June investment round backed by SoftBank, the Japanese investment fund. Stella Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow, criticised the FCA’s “whack-a-mole approach” to targeting BNPL companies. She told the Guardian they were the latest example of “legal loansharking”, in which consumers are encouraged to get into the habit of borrowing money they cannot afford to repay. That was a problem regardless of whether the consumer was charged interest, she said. “This is why we urgently need regulation and it needs to be regulation on a par with the regulation that every other consumer credit company has to abide by,” said Creasy, who played a prominent part in the stricter regulation of payday lenders such as the collapsed Wonga. “These companies and the government are promoting the idea that this is a different industry and needs slightly different regulation. “You can buy a pizza on buy now, pay later. How is that any different to borrowing on a credit card?” Klarna and Laybuy said they backed calls for the sector to be regulated directly by the FCA rather than more general consumer laws. Alex Marsh, the head of Klarna UK, argued that Klarna was “a fairer and more sustainable way for consumers to access credit” because it did not charge consumers fees or interest on the loans. He said the company had welcomed the FCA’s intervention, and that it always made clear it was offering a credit product. Gary Rohloff, who co-founded Laybuy in New Zealand before listing its shares in Australia, said the company was “absolutely committed” to “fair and transparent” terms. A Clearpay spokesperson said the FCA action affected a “very small group of customers who may have incorrectly been charged a late fee”, and added that it wanted to be “as transparent as possible”. Sheldon Mills, the FCA’s executive director of consumers and competition, said: “Buy now, pay later has grown exponentially. We do not yet have powers to regulate these firms but we do have powers to review the terms and conditions of consumer contracts for fairness, and have acted proactively to ensure that the BNPL industry adopts high standards in their terms and conditions. He added that he hoped the rest of the industry would follow the four firms’ voluntary changes to conditions. Openpay was approached for comment.",News/Business,"Four buy now, pay later firms change ‘potentially unfair terms’",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/14/four-buy-now-pay-later-firms-change-potentially-unfair-terms-clearpay-klarna-laybuy-openpay
2/14/2022,"After working as a bartender in Washington DC for many years, Ifeoma Ezumaki’s body reached its limit during the pandemic. For Ezumaki and millions of other restaurant employees, working during the pandemic – often, in the US, for a “sub-minimum” wage – became a source of immeasurable suffering. Tips went down because sales went down, while customer harassment and hostility went up. Ezumaki and her colleagues had to become public health marshals, in addition to cocktail servers; she was asked to enforce social distancing, mask wearing and even vaccination requirements. One evening, a customer at the bar asked her to pull down her mask so that he could see her face – a request that became so common from male customers during the pandemic that hospitality workers started referring to it as “maskual harassment”. When Ezumaki refused, he said: “Well, I guess you’re not going to eat tonight.”  The comment exemplified the power that some male customers, managers and even colleagues feel they have over women’s bodies in the restaurant industry. While Ezumaki and her colleagues wished to protect their bodies and the bodies of their families by wearing a mask, many male customers made it clear that they believed they had the right to control female waiters’ bodies, particularly when the waiters were dependent on tips. Many have reported male customers asking them to take off their masks so that they can judge their looks – and tip on that basis. It is not just customers. My campaign group, One Fair Wage, and Survivors Know, an organisation for survivors of workplace sexual misconduct, collaborated on a report that said staff reports of managers requesting sexual favours at US branches of the golf-themed restaurant chain Topgolf had increased in the past two years. Due to the pandemic causing a reduction in tips, workers were more reliant on managers to give them the best shifts and tables, so rejecting such requests or advances could affect their pay. But the restaurant industry violated women’s bodies long before the pandemic. After the emancipation of enslaved people in the US, the restaurant lobby sought the right to hire newly freed Black people, mostly women, and pay them nothing at all, forcing them to live off customer tips. Restaurants are still able to pay tipped workers a federal minimum wage of just $2.13 (£1.57) an hour based on the legacy of slavery, forcing them to obtain tips to make up the rest of their wage. Studies have also found that hospitality workers suffer among the highest rates of sexual harassment of any industry because they must tolerate inappropriate customer behaviour in return for essential tips. That said, there is so much hope. Women are rising up like never before. Restaurant workers are refusing to allow their bodies to be objectified. In response, thousands of restaurants have had to raise wages to recruit staff. Employers are joining forces with those demanding one fair wage – a full minimum wage, with tips on top. The question now is whether policymakers will grant Ezumaki and her peers the bodily integrity they have always deserved.

2/14/2022,"On the northern coast of the Russian Kola peninsula, bordering the infamously tempestuous Barents Sea, lie half-abandoned military bases, their mossy structures turning ghostly against the silver-grey winter sky. Looking more like a setting for a post-apocalyptic sci-fi film, the area hardly resembles an ideal place to put down roots. Nevertheless, Ilya Povolotsky’s otherworldly documentary shows a small, idiosyncratic community striving to lead meaningful lives in this inhospitable environment. While these unusual souls hail from different backgrounds, they all appear to be living outside the contemporary course of history. Former marine Bardak spends his autumnal years squatting in a rundown building even though his peers opted to move to the cities. Middle-aged Alexander operates a quasi-water bus service, a métier he hopes his teenage daughter Masha will inherit. Still, the young girl is more grounded on land: one particularly spirited sequence finds Masha sprinting with her friend around a shopping mall, where attractive window displays trump the solemn austerity of her father’s cabin.  In contrast to those who are preoccupied with the past – including a ragtag team of amateur divers with a passion for recovering second world war boat wreckage – Dima is an adrenalin-seeking poacher working on the fringes of the law. Povolotsky planned to stage and shoot a sea chase, only for Dima to be pursued by real coast guards; this is where the line between documentary and fiction gets blurred, for dramatic effect. The threading together of the different stories is overly opaque at times, but Evgeny Rodin’s atmospheric cinematography is a marvel, imbuing a Tarkovsky-esque ethereality to a land that has fallen out of step with the modern world.

2/14/2022,"I was doing gigs and studio work, anything to get a record deal. At one point, I won a national karaoke competition held by Yates’s Wine Lodge. The prize was £10,000 and it was like a pub version of The X Factor. So when a chance at the real thing came along, I was ready to try that as well.  I auditioned singing Eva Cassidy’s version of Somewhere Over the Rainbow. My cousin had just passed away, so I sang it in her memory and poured everything into it. Progressing through The X Factor put me in this weird bubble: hardly seeing family or friends and already being recognised in the street. I was 19, came from Hackney in east London, and winning the final seemed a pipe dream. When it happened it felt like an out-of-body experience. After winning, I had to sing for Clive Davis. I kept thinking: “This man launched Whitney Houston!” She was one of my all-time heroes. Simon Cowell mentored me, picking songs and arrangements. We had a few disputes but he shared my vision of who I wanted to be. When I did a showcase gig in LA, I was so nervous I was sick – then I had to go on stage and perform. I vaguely remember meeting songwriters and producers, but I know exactly how I felt when I heard a demo of Bleeding Love. I thought: “This song could have been written for me.” It had a Prince vibe and I just kept playing it over and over. Ryan Tedder, who wrote the song, is a great producer – as well as being the lead singer of OneRepublic. So whenever he said, “Why don’t you try this?”, he was able to actually sing what he meant. I could relate to the song because Ryan can write like a teenage girl. Just before Bleeding Love, I had had a really bad breakup. I thought of that while I was singing. The song came out a year after I won The X Factor. I was worried people might have forgotten me, but the show had such a high profile back then – and YouTube was blowing up, too. The song became so huge [topping the charts in 35 countries] I still can’t explain it. Bleeding Love just seemed to connect with people – and they wanted to hear it again and again. In my 20s, I wrote and produced for Jennifer Lopez. After that, the phone didn’t stop ringing. I actually wrote Bleeding Love for the American singer and actor Jesse McCartney. I’d done a couple of hits with him and he wanted to try something different. Whenever I don’t know what to write, I ask myself: “What would Prince do?” I was in my apartment and started playing organ chords. Even the song’s distorted drums are Prince-like. I soon had the verse, the melody and the opening lyrics: “Closed off from love, I didn’t need the pain / Once or twice was enough, and it was all in vain / Time starts to pass, before you know it you’re frozen.” I’d been thinking about When Doves Cry or Nothing Compares 2 U. I wanted to write a song that was about love but devastating, so thought about breakups that had crushed me in college. I finished the song with Jesse and we came up with the phrase Bleeding Love in the studio. I thought it was the best song I’d ever written, but I got a call from Jesse’s A&R man telling me it wouldn’t make his album. “I don’t personally think the song is a hit,” he said. I was furious and thought: “Either he’s wrong or I need a new job.” Two months later, I was at Leona’s showcase at the Beverly Hilton alongside every writer and producer in the business. I was an up-and-coming nobody, but the moment I heard Leona’s voice, I thought Bleeding Love would be perfect for her. Simon Cowell and Clive Davis both loved the version I’d done with Jesse, so I re-did it with Leona and spent days crafting the strings. People told me that halving the tempo in the middle broke all the rules of songwriting. I sent the finished song to Simon and he said: “I guarantee I’m going to deliver you a UK No 1.” It reached No 1 in the same week OneRepublic did in the US with Apologize – which I’d also written. I’d done another song with Leona at the same time, called Take a Bow, which would have been a single if Rihanna hadn’t released a track with the same title. The only thing better than having a gigantic No 1 with a new artist would have been having two.",Arts/Culture,"‘I thought, what would Prince do?’ How we made Bleeding Love by Leona Lewis",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/14/how-we-made-bleeding-love-by-leona-lewis

Later, I was the social secretary for West Bridgford hockey club and wrote picture quizzes to keep people in the bar before they hit the town on the last match before Christmas. They were full of terrible puns and people enjoyed them, so I recycled them for work Christmas dos . In 2014, I ran out of ideas. I noticed an amusing anagram of one of our informatics packages, and wrote a crossword to incorporate it. It was less popular than the picture quizzes but I really enjoyed setting it and started researching how to do it properly. Do you have a favourite of your own clues or puzzles?It’s rare that I come up with a cryptic definition that I’m confident stands alone, so I was pleased with: 1d He single-handedly fought to secure eternal youth (7,4) I was also pleased with … 18d Pressure on 10 Downing Street leads to Leadsom selling arms (7) … although I had a vague feeling that I’d nicked it – if I did, I couldn’t find where from. I do refer to a lot of living people in my clues, and one made it into a clue that’s a bit risque: 9d Very quietly cuts Lady Garden, perhaps, in shower (6) And sometimes the letters work out perfectly, as when I was delighted to realise that Chas’s partner ended in e: 24d Chas and Dave’s ultimate wind up (5) I’ll give the answers below. Alongside Baroness Garden of Frognal, your puzzles feature plenty of present-day names.That isn’t a deliberate ploy: I guess it’s just what I know about, and what I guess most other people would know about. I have just counted the times living people other than the Queen appear in my first 100 puzzles: it’s 144, although 16 are Donald Trump! All but 20 of them would be disqualified from the Times on that rule alone. Tell us about the Rookie Academy at Big Dave’s Telegraph solvers’ blog.Dave published a new crossword every Saturday. He was overrun with puzzles, many by novice setters and didn’t have time to edit them – so, in Rookie Corner, he publishes them as received and invites comments to help setters improve. Michael Callaghan (AKA Prolixic and Kairos) offered technical advice on the clues. The large amount of technical and other feedback made it an ideal place to submit my first puzzles. Over the years, many Rookies have gone on to set for national newspapers, often starting in the Independent. Mike Hutchinson, the Independent’s crossword editor, has done a fantastic job of finding and publishing new talent with puzzles that are second to none. Seconded. How do you imagine a solver of your crosswords?Peter Biddlecombe described a good solver as a person with “wide but shallow knowledge”. That is how I would describe myself, and I tend to assume the solver is similar. They might not be able to say what a particular book is about, but a character’s name or plot description might ring enough of a bell to give them confidence in an answer. “ Argument of rowing crew leader is baseless (5)”, changing EIGHT to FIGHT, was pretty strong stuff. How often are you tempted to use this kind of wordplay?If I see it, I’m happy to use it – sparingly. I was more concerned with the grammar: the “of” link word is incompatible with the “is”, though it can just about be justified if you consider them as separate sentences. I liked the “baseless” trick enough to overlook that, but normally try to get the grammar spot-on. Crosswords involve playing about with words, and messing about with the shape of the letters is part of that, so I see no problem if it is fairly indicated. Agreed. How did you choose your pseudonyms?Snape was how I was universally known during as an undergraduate: it was the name of my home village and I had some T-shirts showing a drawing of the village. Eccles was my mum’s birth name– I don’t think that that knowledge will give access to my bank accounts! – and was a thank you to her.Finally, how important is humour?For me, very important. I want the people who whiz through my puzzles to have enjoyment too, so I try to at least provide some whimsy. Many thanks to Eccles.

2/14/2022,"Use of the controversial label “excited delirium” by first responders when subduing people exhibiting signs of severe agitation has emerged as a key issue in the federal trial of three former Minneapolis police officers involved in the death of George Floyd.  Tou Thao, J Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane are accused of depriving Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, of his civil rights by failing to give him medical aid while he was handcuffed and lying facedown as their senior colleague Derek Chauvin proceeded to murder him on 25 May 2020. Jurors in the civil rights trial of the three more junior ex-officers have heard that Kueng knelt on Floyd’s back and Lane held down his legs, while Thao kept bystanders back. Kueng and Thao are additionally accused of failing to intervene to stop Chauvin, who was last year found guilty of Floyd’s murder and sentenced to 22 and a half years in prison. Chauvin admitted violating Floyd’s civil rights in his additional federal case last December following Floyd’s murder, which triggered protests worldwide and a reexamination of racism and policing. All were fired from their jobs and arrested days after Floyd’s killing in 2020. Thao, Kueng and Lane have pleaded not guilty in both their federal joint civil rights case and their state criminal case, which is due later this year and in which they are accused of aiding and abetting murder. In the current trial taking place in St Paul, the Minnesota state capital, one of the prosecution’s key arguments is that they were trained to provide medical aid in emergencies, and that Floyd’s situation had become so serious as police held him down that bystanders, even children with no medical training, knew something was wrong. Kelly McCarthy, chief of police in Mendota Heights police department and chair of Minnesota’s Police Officers Standards and Training board, testified last week that officers are specifically taught to reposition someone who is restrained face down, to ensure they can breathe. Asked why, she said: “There were enough in-custody deaths that we needed to have a learning objective on it.” A day earlier, the head of the Minneapolis police department’s homicide unit testified that the officers should have intervened to begin first aid or take action that even means moving another officer out of the way if necessary. Minneapolis Lt Richard Zimmerman, who also testified at Chauvin’s trial last year, said when the other officers saw Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck “the officers should have intervened at that point and stopped it”. But defense arguments have repeatedly focused on the condition termed excited delirium, and the training of police to respond to it, suggesting the officers were following procedure about restraining someone they thought was experiencing such a health syndrome. The Minneapolis police department and city mayor Jacob Frey’s office have said the city halted such training last year, after the American Medical Association (AMA) rejected the diagnosis of excited delirium. The AMA, called it a “manifestation of systemic racism” that had been misapplied to justify excessive police force or pharmacological interventions such as ketamine and “disproportionately cited in cases where Black men die in law enforcement custody”. But a Minneapolis police training video of the updated process, obtained through a public records request from the Minneapolis Star Tribune newspaper, showed officers still being trained using studies with “excited delirium” in the titles. The video included an emergency physician advising that the term had become “triggering” and suggesting that another termwas used, such as “severe agitation with delirium.” In either respect, the diagnosis is controversial. Federal prosecutors played a portion of Lane’s body camera video showing the officers describing elements of their struggle to try to put Floyd in their squad car after they had arrived outside a corner store following a report that he had tried to use counterfeit money. “He kind of seemed like he was on something ... He was fighting the whole time,” Lane said. Lane’s attorney later focused on how his client is seen on video calling for an ambulance and expressing concern that Floyd might be experiencing “excited delirium”. “Should we roll him on the side?” Lane asked. “I just worry about the excited delirium or whatever.” An autopsy later revealed that Floyd had fentanyl, a powerful opioid sedative and painkiller, and methamphetamine, a stimulant, in his system but neither were listed as the cause of death. The issue came up in Derek Chauvin’s trial last year when jurors heard from defense attorneys arguing Chauvin acted reasonably and that officers are taught how to recognize signs of the physical and psychiatric state known as excited delirium from incoherence, extraordinary strength, sweat, or suffering from abnormal body temperature, or if a person appears to have suddenly snapped. Forensic expert Bill Smock testified that Floyd met none of the 10 criteria developed by the American College of Emergency Physicians. Prosecutors described the topic as a “story” created by Chauvin’s defense to shift blame for Floyd’s death after fatally depriving him of oxygen. In the current trial, the court heard testimony from Derek Smith, a paramedic dispatched to the scene. He acknowledged the dispute over the diagnosis, indicated that in his experience it is real, and said he suspected Floyd had the condition based on what officers told him. Controversy over the diagnosis is set to continue despite the change in name to “severe agitation with delirium”. And according to the Star Tribune, the Minneapolis police department instructed officers to ignore the findings from a watchdog investigation that found police inappropriately asking paramedics to sedate uncooperative people. Prosecutors have told the court that they will rest their case Monday after three weeks of testimony.",News/US news,‘Excited delirium’ emerges as key issue in trial of officers accused over George Floyd death,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/14/george-floyd-death-civil-trial-officers-minneapolis
2/14/2022,"Senior figures in climate diplomacy, including the key architect of the Paris climate agreement, have urged the UK government to maintain its commitments to climate action, amid escalating attacks intended to generate a “culture war” on the net zero target. Laurence Tubiana, the French diplomat who crafted the 2015 Paris agreement, now chief executive of the European Climate Foundation, said: “We are not happy, and we are crossing our fingers [that the UK will reaffirm its net zero commitment]. It’s very important that the UK keeps this direction of travel.”  She and other international observers are increasingly worried that the rows over net zero within the UK government, which have seen the Net Zero Scrutiny Group linking the cost-of-living crisis to the carbon reduction agenda, will undermine the progress made last year at the Cop26 UN climate talks. The UK will continue to lead the talks until Egypt takes over at the next summit, Cop27, this November. British leadership will be essential to the success of Cop27, as countries must use the next eight months to revise their national emissions-cutting plans, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs), as they agreed to do at Glasgow. But British diplomats will be hamstrung if rows at home over net zero overshadow their efforts, and if support from key cabinet ministers – including the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, who has barely mentioned Cop26 although it was the biggest diplomatic event on British soil since the second world war – continues to be lukewarm or nonexistent. Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, praised the UK for the “really marvellous” achievements of Glasgow, and said it was “irresponsible” for some to claim that net zero was behind raising energy prices. “I hope the UK will continue with the leadership that we have seen at Glasgow, and go further to make sure that governments fulfil their pledges they have made before and during Glasgow. The UK is capable and responsible for making sure these are implemented.” Birol added: “The current high energy prices are nothing to do with net zero. This is not a clean energy crisis, or a renewable energy crisis. These claims are irresponsible and are being used to attack public support for the net zero transition.” Jennifer Morgan, the outgoing chief of Greenpeace International, told the Guardian shortly before her recent appointment as the German government’s climate envoy that any indication the attacks on net zero were persuading ministers to backpedal would be severely damaging. “It would clearly reduce the UK’s standing in the world, and as a partner for tackling the world’s biggest issue,” she said. “It would be a complete failure of leadership, and the world would judge [the UK government] harshly.” The British public was also being harmed, added Rachel Kyte, a former World Bank climate official, now dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University and a climate adviser to the UN secretary-general. “There is something deeply disturbing about would-be political leaders jockeying for position by seizing on high energy prices, wilfully misdiagnosing the causes as shifting to renewable energy, and then suggesting as a remedy a harmful about-face by abandoning net zero goals. It is perverse and disingenuous, selling the British public out, and the opposite of the long view demanded of leaders today in combating climate change,” she said. Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate adviser, now with the Progressive Policy Institute, said that although political attention was focused on Biden’s stimulus, the UK government’s moves on net zero were also viewed with concern. “Boris Johnson’s dedication to net zero is seen in Washington as a linchpin for greater ambition by nations around the world, including at Cop27, so his recent troubles and backbencher bellyaches on climate are worrisome,” he warned. “Johnson should never allow the Tory right fringe to undermine his climate legacy.”",News/Environment,UK urged not to abandon climate goals amid net zero row,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/14/uk-urged-not-to-abandon-climate-goals-amid-net-zero-row
