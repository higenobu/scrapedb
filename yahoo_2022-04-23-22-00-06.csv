4/23/2022,"BBQ chain Hard Eight failed to pay $867,000 in tips and overtime to employees over nearly two years. The DoL reported the news, following an investigation. The chain told a local outlet it had immediately changed its practices upon learning about the rules. A Texas BBQ chain owed nearly $900,000 in unpaid tips and overtime to its employees in what it said was a misunderstanding of labor laws, the US Department of Labor reported on Thursday. The DOL discovered that Hard Eight's Roanoke chain had failed to distribute $867,000 to 910 employees across the branch's five restaurants. The report stated the company failed to pay tipped employees their tips in full. Roanoke Hard Eight then shared the withheld tips among managers, who weren't paid for their correct hours and only paid a half rate for overtime, it added. In the statement released by the DOL on Thursday, wage and hour district director Jesus A. Valdez said, ""Roanoke Hard Eight violated the law by including managers in their tip pool. By doing so, the employer denied tipped workers some of their tips and managers proper overtime wages."" The Wages and Fair Standards Act prohibits employers, managers, and supervisors from withholding tips received by the workers they oversee. Hard Eight and the Department of Labor did not immediately respond to Insider's requests for comment outside regular working hours. According to Valdez in the report, the damage amounted to nearly $1,000 in unpaid tips and overtime per employee, an error that would harm the restaurant's credibility in the future. ""As businesses struggle to find people to do the work needed to keep operating, employers would be wise to avoid violations or risk finding it even more difficult to retain and recruit workers who can choose to seek jobs where they will receive all of their rightful wages,"" he continued. Hard Eight's chief operating officer Matt Perry told NBC 5 on Friday afternoon that the company was made aware of the investigation in 2020 and its actions related to a misunderstanding of legislation. In an emailed statement to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, the restaurant's executive director Katie Gooch said: ""At that time, our floor managers, who are deeply involved in the hands-on guest experience, were included in our tip sharing program."" ""We learned about the new rules during a Department of Labor review and immediately changed our practices. We compensated all affected hourly employees and former employees. We also gave our floor managers a wage increase,"" she added.

4/23/2022,"An Idaho board that recommends place names will play no role in replacing a racial slur found on 66 Idaho mountains, creeks, valleys and other geographical features. The Idaho Geographical Names Advisory Council typically weighs in when an unnamed location gets a name or when an existing name is changed. But not this time, as the U.S. Department of the Interior works to rename 660 places found on federal land across the country that use the word “squaw.” “This is kind of out of the normal process that we have,” Boisean Rick Just, who heads the council, said by phone. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland declared the S-word to be derogatory in an order issued Nov. 19. Haaland, an enrolled member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe in New Mexico and the first Native American to serve as a Cabinet secretary, issued the order to have the name scrubbed from federal features. Those who wish to comment on the changes or to offer suggestions for renaming Squaw Butte outside Emmett or any of the other features can do so online though Monday, April 25. After the comment period ends, The Derogatory Geographic Names Task Force will review comments from the public and Native American tribes. Within 90 days, the task force will submit proposed name changes to the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. The board will have 60 days to make a decision on all of the proposed names. In February, the U.S. Geological Survey issued a list of suggested replacement names for the features. They were not necessarily creative; they were simply taken from other nearby features. The five suggested replacement names for Squaw Butte north of Emmett come from nearby streams: Corral Creek, Jakes Creek, Haw Creek, Long Hollow Creek and Spring Creek. Those aren’t necessarily practical, but they provide a starting point for discussion, Just said. “They had so many to name that they looked around to other features nearby and put a name on it that sounded like it fit the area,” Just said. “I think there will be a lot of people who will take this opportunity to research the history in their area and come up with something appropriate.” Emmett resident Gregory Hall suggests Wa’ipi Butte as an appropriate replacement for Squaw Butte. Wa’ipi is Shoshone for “woman,” he wrote in a Facebook post. Emmett and Squaw Butte are located on traditional Shoshone-Bannock Tribes lands. Others denounced the change, as detailed in an Idaho Statesman story. Several people said the name was meant to honor Native Americans and that an image of a Native maiden can be seen in the butte. Others called the change “woke” politics. “It will always be Squaw Butte for all the people who have lived here our whole lives,” Emmett resident Karla Kimball wrote on Facebook. “That is one thing that doesn’t need to change.” Some people claimed they have family or friends who are Native Americans and who don’t have a problem with the name. That’s not the case with the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes, located on the Fort Hall Reservation in East Idaho. “Removing the words squaw from all of Idaho place names needs to happen,” Randy’L Teton, public affairs manager for the tribes, wrote in an email last year to the Idaho Statesman. The S-word originated with the Algonquin-speaking Natives of Southeastern New England. It originally meant “woman,” but became a slur used by white settlers in as early as the 1600s. In 2007, the U.S. Board on Geographic Names approved removing the S-word from eight place names in North Idaho. Three were on the Coeur d’Alene Reservation, with five outside the reservation but in the tribe’s ancestral territory. The Coeur d’Alene Tribe asked for the names to be removed. Native American names would be appropriate for those features now known by the S-word, Just said. “The Native Americans probably had names for a lot of those features that might have gone back a lot more than the 100-150 years that these have been in existence,” he said. Idaho saw a surge in population following the Civil War, Just said. Many of the new settlers came from Confederate states. “They brought some of those names that they were used to and didn’t give much thought to what the Indians called anything,” he said. The name of this Idaho butte is a slur. It and 71 place names statewide to be replaced ‘Squaw’ is an ugly stain on Idaho maps.

4/23/2022,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill on Friday stripping Disney of its self-governing status. He recently signed a controversial education law and proposed a GOP-benefitting redistricting map. A top Florida legislator said the Disney bill diverts attention from the state's redistricting plan. A top state legislator in Florida said he believes there's an ulterior motive behind Gov. Ron Desantis stripping Disney of its special tax status in an ongoing feud over the state's controversial education law dubbed by advocates and critics the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill. On Friday, DeSantis signed a bill into law that would sunset a special taxing and governance area — in which the landowners are primarily Walt Disney World — known as the Reedy Creek Improvement District by June 2023. But Senate Minority Leader Gary Farmer told Insider that DeSantis' public dispute with Disney is taking attention away from other legislative agendas the Florida governor has been putting forth — namely, the new proposed redistricting map that would give the GOP an edge in the state at the expense of Black voters. ""Governor DeSantis' attack on Disney was designed to act as a smokescreen for the much more devious original and singular purpose of this special session, the passage of a racist and unconstitutional redistricting plan,"" Farmer said. The dissolution bill came after Disney denounced the state's controversial Parental Rights in Education legislation. In a statement on March 28, the company vowed to actively work to repeal the legislation, saying it ""should never have passed and should never have been signed into law."" In response, DeSantis said Disney ""crossed the line"" with their calls to repeal the legislation, saying ""this state is governed by the interests of the people of the state of Florida"" not ""on the demands of California corporate executives."" During a press conference at the bill signing on Friday, DeSantis said the state legislature viewed the company's denouncing as a ""provocation."" ""You're a corporation based in Burbank, California, and you're gonna marshal your economic might to attack the parents of my state,"" DeSantis said. ""We view that as a provocation, and we're going to fight back against that."" His sentiments were echoed by Lt. Gov Jeanette Nuñes. On Thursday, Newsmax host Eric Bolling asked Nuñes if the governor would reconsider repealing Disney's special tax status if the company gave up its ""'woke' agenda,'"" to which she replied: ""Sure."" Aside from implementing the state's controversial education law and subsequently punishing Disney for speaking out against the legislation, DeSantis has had a string of legislative wins, including pushing a redistricting map that would reduce the number of predominantly Black districts. On March 28, the same day DeSantis signed the state's Parental Rights in Education bill into law, DeSantis vetoed a version of the congressional map approved by state legislators that would have added two Republican seats and subtracted one from the Democrats, according to The New York Times. On Wednesday, the Florida Senate passed DeSantis' congressional map during a special session that would instead create 20 likely Republican seats and leave eight for Democrats, The Times reported. DeSantis claimed that the existence of such districts have been ""racially gerrymandered,"" adding that the new congressional map put out by his office would be ""race-neutral."" ""I mean, we are not going to have a 200-mile gerrymander that divvies up people based on the color of their skin,"" DeSantis said, per CNN. ""That is wrong. That is not the way we've governed in the state of Florida."" Despite the larger political implications and ramifications of DeSantis' redistricting plan, Farmer said the governor waging a war on Disney has been diverting media attention from the new proposed congressional map. ""On the same day that this anti-Disney measure passed, the Legislature also rammed through an unconstitutional, unlawful, and racist redistricting plan that slashed Florida's Black representation in Congress in half,"" Farmer said. He added: ""No one really expects this Reedy Creek dissolution to actually happen, but the threat of sending the rights of Black voters back 50 years into the past is very, very real, that is what we all should be talking about today.""

4/23/2022,"Holocaust survivor Vanda Semyonovna Obiedkova, 91, died on April 4, according to Jewish News. Her daughter said she spent weeks in an ""unbearably cold"" basement while Russia bombed Mariupol. As a child, Obiedkova also hid in a basement during the Nazi conquest of Ukraine in 1941. A Ukrainian Holocaust survivor died in Mariupol after spending several weeks underground in an ""unbearably cold"" basement, according to Jewish News. Vanda Semyonovna Obiedkova, 91, took cover under a heating supplies shop with her family as Russia relentlessly bombed her city, Jewish News reported. She lived without heating, electricity, or running water, the media outlet said. ""It was unbearably cold,"" her daughter Larissa told Chabad.org — the news website for the Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic movement. Semyonovna Obiedkova became bedridden with sickness, per Jewish News, eventually succumbing to her illness on April 4. ""Mama didn't deserve such a death,"" Larissa said, per Chabad.org. The family buried Semyonovna Obiedkova in a local park before fleeing to a safe location, away from the constant bombing, Chabad.org said. According to Larissa, her Holocaust survivor mother repeatedly asked her family: ""Why is this happening?"" Over 21,000 people have so far been killed in Mariupol, Insider reported. Makeshift graves are filling the streets, the report said. As bombs crashed above the family, Larissa said her Holocaust survivor mother spent her final days comparing her ordeal to what she had experienced during the Nazi occupation of Mariupol in 1941. ""Every time a bomb fell, the entire building shook,"" she recounted. ""My mother kept saying she didn't remember anything like this during World War II."" It wasn't Semyonovna Obiedkova's first time sheltering underground. She evaded arrest during the Nazi occupation by hiding in a basement in 1941. Her mother was captured and was among the approximately 16,000 Jews who were executed on the outskirts of Mariupol, Chabad.org said.

4/23/2022,"President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine has upended Russia's international and domestic affairs. Reports suggest concerns about the invasion are growing even within the Kremlin. ""It's suicidally bad what he's doing to his country"" and ""its standing in the world,"" an expert said. Russian President Vladimir Putin is facing increasing animosity both abroad and at home as his war in Ukraine approaches two full months. Experts cite strategy failures, mounting military losses, and the dire economic consequences of Western sanctions — all blamed almost entirely on Putin — as evidence painting a bleak picture of Russia's future. ""It's suicidally bad what he's doing to his country, its economy, and its standing in the world,"" said Robert English, a professor at the University of Southern California who studies Russia, the Soviet Union, and Eastern Europe. The longtime Russian leader's decisions on the Ukraine invasion face rising scrutiny as a small but growing number of Kremlin insiders have started to express doubts about the war. Ten sources with direct knowledge of the conflict conveyed their concerns to Bloomberg this month, saying they regarded the invasion as a catastrophic mistake that'd set the country back decades. The report described the critics as spread across senior positions in government and state-run businesses. While Putin continues to present a confident front — hand-waving the true cost of Western sanctions and dismissing the political consequences of war — some Russia insiders are said to be losing faith. English says they have good reason to do so. He said Putin's foray into Ukraine had already proved more costly for Russia than the Soviet Union's nearly 10-year war in Afghanistan in the 1980s. ""The USSR lost around 15,000-plus soldiers in Afghanistan in a decade of fighting,"" English said. ""And that was enough to be considered a 'bleeding wound,""' he added. ""Putin has lost close to that amount in one month — not one year, much less 10 years — but in one month."" ""So, his reckoning is coming much more quickly,"" English added. Moscow acknowledged in late March — its most recent update — that 1,351 of its troops had been killed and 3,825 others wounded in the invasion. NATO estimates put the likely death toll closer to 15,000, while Ukraine says it has killed nearly 20,000 Russian troops. Ordinary Russians are beginning to feel the economic pinch of tough Western sanctions. Putin has conceded that sanctions have started to upset the country's energy industry but has publicly maintained that Russia's economy has not been undermined as a result. The head of Russia's central bank, however, warned that the full impact of sanctions had not yet been felt, and Moscow's mayor said this week that 200,000 residents could lose their jobs with Western companies pulling out of the country en masse. ""He's set the country back economically,"" English said. ""It's losing all of its important trade ties and its resource customers in the West."" The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development estimated last month that Russia's gross domestic product — a popular measure of the size of an ecomony — would shrink by 10% this year. Even as Russia readjusts its military strategy, pulling back from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and focusing attacks on eastern Ukraine as part of its ""new phase"" of the war, English said the damage to Russia's international and domestic standing had already been done. ""Russia will be a pariah state in the eyes of many people forever — but at least for a decade to come,"" he said. ""Until Putin goes, there'll be no sense of cleansing and starting over."" But experts and insiders have also said Putin is unlikely to go anywhere anytime soon. Bloomberg's sources said Putin viewed himself as being on a historic mission — one he is said to believe has the Russian public's support.

4/23/2022,"Russian President Vladimir Putin is claiming control over Ukraine's port city of Mariupo l even as its defenders are still holding out at a giant seaside steel mill. His statement reflected the importance of the city on the Sea of Azov and appeared to be an attempt to declare victory without storming the last pocket of Ukrainian resistance there: the massive Azovstal plant. WHY IS MARIUPOL IMPORTANT? Mariupol, which is part of the industrial region in eastern Ukraine known as the Donbas, has been a key Russian objective since the Feb. 24 invasion began. Capturing the city would allow the establishment of a land corridor from Russia's border to Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula that Moscow annexed in 2014. It also would deprive Ukraine of a major port and prized industrial assets. The seven-week siege has tied up significant numbers of Russian forces, which are badly needed for an offensive elsewhere in the Donbas. The region is where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian government forces since 2014, after the Crimea annexation. HOW HAS THE RUSSIAN SIEGE GONE? Since it began March 1, the Russian military has pummeled Mariupol relentlessly with artillery barrages and air raids, flattening most of the once-bustling city. The indiscriminate bombardment has hit homes, hospitals and other public buildings, killing thousands. That includes about 300 people killed in an airstrike on the Mariupol Drama Theater that was being used as a shelter, with officials inscribing the Russian word for “CHILDREN” in huge white letters on the pavement outside. Mayor Vadym Boychenko told The Associated Press that at least 21,000 people were killed in Mariupol, with bodies “carpeted through the streets.” He said Russia deployed mobile cremation equipment to methodically dispose of the remains in order to destroy evidence of the massacre and prevent international organizations from documenting “the horror the Russian army is responsible for.” He alleged bodies also were dumped into mass graves outside the city. He estimated that 120,000 people remain in Mariupol out of a prewar population of about 450,000. HOW HAS UKRAINE RESPONDED? Ukraine sent some of its best troops to defend Mariupol. They included the 36th Marine Brigade, Interior Ministry troops, border guards and the national guard’s Azov Regiment. The regiment is a seasoned volunteer force that is widely considered one of Ukraine’s most capable units and has been singled out by Russia as a particular villain because of its far-right ideology. Moscow has deployed fighters from Chechnya, known for their ferocity, to wage street battles in Mariupol. Chechnya’s Moscow-backed leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, has repeatedly boasted on social media about defeating Ukrainians in Mariupol, but the fight has continued. After weeks of house-to-house battles in which Russia has incurred massive losses, including several senior officers, Mariupol's defenders holed up at the last remaining pocket of resistance — the mammoth Azovstal plant that employed 10,000 workers before the war. WHY HAS THE BATTLE FOR THE STEEL MILL TAKEN SO LONG? A few thousand Ukrainian troops, by Moscow's estimate, remained in the plant, which covers an area of nearly 11 square kilometers (over 4.2 square miles). Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said about 1,000 civilians were also trapped in the plant. Azovstal has a 24-kilometer (15-mile) labyrinth of underground tunnels and passages, which allowed its defenders to maneuver freely to repel the Russian attacks. Before the war, Ukrainian authorities prepared for the Russian offensive by building up stockpiles of food and water at Azovstal. “The plant covers a huge area, and the Ukrainians can move through underground tunnels to quickly change location,” said Ukrainian military expert Oleh Zhdanov. “Azovstal is very hard to storm, and the Russians risk losing many troops, resources and, most importantly, time there,” Zhdanov said. “It's a city within a city, and fighting there could take months.” He added that “as long as Mariupol holds, the Russians can't redeploy 10-12 of their elite units to other areas in eastern Ukraine.” The city ""keeps distracting the Russian army forces and thwarting the Kremlin plans for an offensive in the Donbas.” HOW IS PUTIN PORTRAYING THE BATTLE FOR MARIUPOL? Putin met Thursday with Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, who said the entire city except Azovstal is now under Russian control. It would take three to four days to flush the Ukrainian troops out of the steel mill, he added. In a tightly choreographed televised meeting, Putin congratulated the military, saying that “putting such an important center in the south as Mariupol under control is a success.” At the same time, he ordered Shoigu not to send troops into Azovstal to finish off the resistance, so as to avoid losses. Instead, the plant would be sealed tightly ""so that not even a fly comes through.” The remarks appeared to reflect Putin's attempt to claim victory without a bloody, all-out assault of the plant in hopes that its defenders will surrender after running out of food and ammunition. Putin said nothing about halting a bombardment of the plant, which will probably continue. HOW IS UKRAINE RESPONDING? Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, mocked Putin's claim of victory, saying it reflects the fact the Russian military ""cannot physically capture Azovstal.” Retired British Rear Adm. Chris Parry described Putin’s remarks as a sign of a shift in approach, observing that ""the Russian agenda now is not to capture these really difficult places where the Ukrainians can hold out in the urban centers, but to try and capture territory and also to encircle the Ukrainian forces and declare a huge victory.” Parry likened the Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol to the battle of Stalingrad, in which the Red Army routed the Nazis blockading the city in a key turning point in World War II. “I think there’s a great totemic value in the Ukrainians holding on to Mariupol,” Parry said. “If the Ukrainians can hang on to it ... elevated to the level of Stalingrad, then I think it’s going to be a major lever for them both in the propaganda war, but also on the ground campaign as well.” Commanders of Ukrainian units at the plant made a series of desperate video appeals in recent days, saying they are clinging by a thread and begging for help. Maj. Serhiy Volynskyy of the 36th Marine Brigade said in a video Wednesday that “we are probably facing our last days, if not hours,” adding that “the enemy outnumbers us 10-1.” “We appeal and plead to all world leaders to help us,” he said, asking world leaders to help safely evacuate the plant's defenders and civilians holed up there. Zelenskyy said about 1,000 civilians could be taking shelter in the plant and that “we are open to different formats of exchange of our people for Russian people, Russian military that they have left behind.” But he added that Russia has stonewalled Ukraine’s attempts for a negotiated exit. ___ Yuras Karmanau in Lviv, Ukraine, and Danica Kirka in London contributed. ___ Follow the AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",World/Associated Press,EXPLAINER: Why the battle for Mariupol's steel mill matters,https://news.yahoo.com/explainer-why-battle-mariupols-steel-172917378.html
