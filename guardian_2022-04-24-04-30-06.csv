4/24/2022,"For Evertonians, perhaps the most upsetting aspect of the past week has been the number of Liverpool fans and former players reflecting on what a shame it would be if they got relegated. “I would be sad and I’m sure there’s a lot of other Liverpool fans who’d feel the same,” Ian Rush said on Friday. Jürgen Klopp used his press conference to lament Everton’s plight, admitting he would miss the derby if they ended up in the Championship next season. In a way, the outpouring of lament is its own sly little twist of the knife. Turns out Everton could bear Liverpool’s hatred. They could live with the taunting and the tribal banter. It’s the sympathy they can’t stand. But as a measure of the yawning void between these two clubs before the 240th Merseyside derby, it is as good as any. Doubtless there are still a few Liverpool fans out there who would gleefully celebrate Everton’s relegation as a fifth trophy, just as Everton fans will enthusiastically cheer on Villarreal in the Champions League on Wednesday. Yet such is the divergence between them that you increasingly get the sense that neither is any longer the business of the other. In sporting terms, these two clubs may as well inhabit different worlds. Frank Lampard said he would take a draw at Anfield on Sunday. Of course he would. So would most of his predecessors. But until recently it is a prospect none of them would dare entertain, let alone utter on camera. But Liverpool have bigger prizes on their mind these days and so do Everton. The formbook does not go out of the window. Local pride is not at stake. The wider tussle has already been won and lost. Liverpool v Everton may still be a derby in the strictest definition of the word. But it is no longer a rivalry. These things have always ebbed and flowed. Everton and Liverpool were in separate divisions for most of the 1950s, went head to head for much of the 1980s and as recently as 2013 Everton finished above Liverpool in the league. But rarely in our lifetimes has the gulf felt as wide or as dramatic as it does now. Liverpool finished 14 places ahead of Everton in 1998 and 50 points ahead in their title-winning season of 2020. Barring an extreme shift in fortunes, both marks are likely to be smashed in 2022. How we reached this point is a more complex issue: a confluence of gambles taken and not taken, of mis-steps and mismanagement, of a team who discovered their identity and a team who mislaid theirs. It’s easy to forget Liverpool have been a dysfunctional club for almost as long as Everton, enduring their own decades of nostalgic neglect, forlornly chasing lost glories. Take a snapshot of the two clubs a decade ago and on the pitch or off it, there is frankly little to choose between them. For all the disparity in resources, the biggest contrast over the subsequent years has been one of vision and conviction. All clubs make mistakes, lose their way, undergo periods of turbulence or crisis. Liverpool may have hit the jackpot with Klopp, but it also required them to keep the faith in his leadership and brand of football, even when results took a turn and nobody could really be sure what lay ahead. By comparison, Everton’s reaction to a difficult few months under Ronald Koeman in 2017 was to hit the panic button and hire the cloven hooves of Sam Allardyce to coach a squad full of technical passers. In the short term it worked. But the brake it put on their long-term ambitions was fatal. It broadcast to everyone – future coaches, prospective players, fans and sponsors – that their principles were essentially disposable. Everton arguably haven’t been the same club since. Even through the briefly promising Marco Silva years, the decadent Carlo Ancelotti years, the Rafa Benítez months, the strange outbreaks of Duncan Ferguson, there has been no sense of wider strategy, no basic idea. Go down the list of Liverpool’s dozen biggest signings of the past decade and only Christian Benteke really stands out as a mistake. Go through the Everton list and you are confronted by an army of squandered talents, from Gylfi Sigurdsson to Yannick Bolasie, Moise Kean to Davy Klaassen, players signed in the service of a grand masterplan that would invariably be binned in a matter of months. Lampard, for his part, does at least seem to have a clear idea of how he wants Everton to play and who he wants to do it. Last week, footage emerged of a training drill in which Everton were practising quick long balls over the top of a high back line, similar to the one they are likely to encounter on Sunday. Certainly it will be interesting to see what he can do with a little time, a full transfer window and a squad that for all its unevenness and injury blight is still far better than its league position would suggest. In a way you wonder whether the reality of being left behind by their city rivals may just be a blessing in disguise. For some time now – decades, really – so much of Everton’s psychology and approach have been bound up in trying to emulate Liverpool, equal them, surpass them. That giant blur of red in their windscreen has informed some of their costliest mistakes and most destructive delusions. Well, that war is over. The blur of red has disappeared into the distance and it isn’t coming back. Best to start over, in your own time and on your own terms.",Sport/Football,Liverpool v Everton may still be a derby but it is no longer a rivalry | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/23/liverpool-everton-derby-cannot-be-a-rivalry
4/24/2022,"The two best teams in Europe, the most successful club in the history of the competition, a gritty outsider – in some ways the lineup for this week’s Champions League semi-finals is perfect. Each offers in addition an intriguing subplot: Pep Guardiola fighting the curse of overthought, Jürgen Klopp and Liverpool chasing an implausible quadruple, Luka Modric and Karim Benzema raging against the dying of the light, the frankly hilarious prospect of Unai Emery returning to Paris for the final and making a point to Paris Saint-Germain, a club that never took him seriously (perhaps he could have a three-day party to celebrate and invite Neymar along to cut the cake as the Brazilian had him do during his 26th-birthday celebrations). And yet, and yet … the four clubs come from only two countries and those two countries are England and Spain, who have between them produced 62.5% of all semi-finalists over the past two decades. Even the outsiders are Villarreal. Theirs may be a remarkable story, a team made up almost entirely of Tottenham flops and targets hailing from a town with a population, as surely everybody knows by now, of only 50,000, who have overcome the might of Juventus and Bayern Munich thanks to the tactical ministrations of a manager who was essentially written off by Arsenal because his Vs sound a bit like Bs – but they come from La Liga. The Anglo-Spanish hegemony goes on. There are no outsiders any more. What other giant-killers have there been recently? Atalanta – a small club who have performed miracles given their budget, but a team from Serie A. Ajax – the biggest club in the Netherlands. Tottenham – a wealthy club from the Premier League with an enormous modern stadium in London who are funded by a tax exile. RB Leipzig – who come no closer to a fairy story than Red Bull having used Sleeping Beauty in an advertising campaign; they may obey the letter of the Bundesliga’s 50+1 ownership legislation but they have obliterated its spirit. Of the 80 semi-finalists over the past 20 years, 26 have been from Spain and 24 from England. Portugal has provided one, the Netherlands two, with the rest coming from Germany, Italy and France. This is not a pan-European competition any more, it is a global tournament that has de facto franchises in a tiny handful of western European nations. Uefa’s decision to establish the Europa Conference League is at least an acknowledgement of that, a competition that offers six high(ish)-profile group games to the champions of places such as Norway, Slovenia and Israel, plus a number of other mid-ranking sides otherwise shut out of European competition. It threw up a diverse spread of quarter-finalists – from seven different countries – but it is far too little, far too late. Perhaps nobody cares; perhaps even to think that football should be more inclusive, to yearn for Reims and Nottingham Forest, Malmö and Steaua Bucharest, is to be hopelessly nostalgic. The protests that surrounded the collapse of the proposed European Super League a year ago hinted at a desire for another world, for a way of doing things that wasn’t just about commerce, but it was a moment that vanished on the wind. There has been no fan protest against the takeover of Newcastle by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia; indeed a vocal minority have attacked those who have wondered how healthy it is for this venerable community institution to be sold off to a body representing a state accused of a catalogue of human rights abuses. Now that Chelsea fans have been forced by sanctions to contemplate their ownership, the main question seems to be which billionaire who might take over will spend the most money. Are Arsenal fans in any way concerned that they bear on their team’s sleeves an imprecation to “Visit Rwanda”, whose president, Paul Kagame, has been accused, among a litany of allegations, of assassinating political opponents? This is the tragedy of modern English football. It has never been so successful. It has never been watched by so many people, either in the stadiums or on television around the globe. It has never generated so much revenue. Yet still everybody is holding out for a bigger sugar daddy, wondering which billionaire or oligarch or sovereign wealth fund or hedge fund might buy them even more glitzy players. This is the story of modern Britain: ask not the source of the money, just how much of it there is. What were those protests about? If they were protesting against a system that perpetuates the dominance of the elite, it’s already here. In August 2016, in the interregnum between the suspension of Michel Platini and the election of Aleksander Ceferin as Uefa president, a deal was driven through by Bayern’s Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Juventus’s Andrea Agnelli that has meant that since 2018, 30% of broadcast revenues from the Champions League are distributed to the 32 sides in the group stage based on performances in Uefa competition over the past 10 years. Or to contextualise that, if West Ham qualify for next season’s Champions League by winning the Europa League, they will receive 4% of what Chelsea get. And still this stitch-up isn’t enough. Still the existing elite are looking to fortify their own positions, demanding that two places form the revised 36-team group stage to come into effect from 2024 be allocated according to coefficient. They are already incredibly rich. They already have huge established fanbases. They already have a system stacked in their favour, and still they want another safety net. It means clubs can be as badly run as Manchester United and Juventus have been for the past decade and remain at the highest table. It may have a different name. It may disguise its intentions. It may be come by creeping increment rather than in one clumsy swoop, but the Super League is here. Football as corporate entertainment product thrives, and is undeniably good to watch, the quality and drama in the latter stages of the Champions League unprecedentedly high. But football as sport, football as an expression of something beautiful in the human soul, as the most democratic of sports, open to all, has been dying for years. All we are doing now is deciding what the sarcophagus will look like.",Sport/Football,"By stealth rather than in one swoop, the European Super League has arrived | Jonathan Wilson",https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/23/by-stealth-rather-than-in-one-swoop-the-european-super-league-has-arrived
4/24/2022,"A whistleblower working on Britain’s Homes for Ukraine scheme has revealed that he and his colleagues “don’t know what we’re doing”, and claims the scheme has been “designed to fail” in order to limit numbers entering the UK. Amid criticism over the numbers of Ukrainians so far allowed to come to the UK, the insider revealed that confusion, poor morale and lack of guidance meant staff contracted to the scheme frequently resorted to “making up” their response to cases. Staff working on the helpline for the scheme – introduced after widespread fury over the UK government’s initial response to the Ukrainian refugee crisis – revealed that they received only three hours of training with no follow-up help, and said any complaint or suggestion to improve the system was met with silence. “We don’t really know what we’re doing,” said the source, who works for the private company responsible for processing the documentation of Ukrainian refugees. “The system is designed, it would appear, for people to fail. They want to keep the numbers down. Everything they do feels as if it is to do that. I’ve even had a barrister and lawyers on the phone saying they couldn’t understand the system.” The whistleblower questioned the official government data on Ukrainian refugees, claiming the statistics gave the impression that ministers were being more generous than they were in reality. The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he had dealt with numerous cases where UK visas had been issued for an entire Ukrainian family apart from one child, which in effect stopped the family travelling to the UK. “This allows the government to say we’ve issued lots of visas. Yet, because they have withheld one, it’s a guarantee those Ukrainians won’t travel,” said the source. The whistleblower said he came across four or five cases each day in which a single child from a family had not received permission to travel, a pattern he believed was “too much of a coincidence” for it not to have been encouraged. A government source said that family applications were “normally processed together” but cases differed in complexity, and that safeguarding processes were in place to protect children from trafficking. Latest government figures show that 40,000 UK visas have been issued under the Homes for Ukraine scheme since it was launched five weeks ago – yet just 6,600 Ukrainians have actually arrived. One sponsor who offered a place in her home for a mother and daughter from Borodyanka – a small town north of Kyiv that was devastated during the Russian invasion – told the Observer the child had still not received their visa after a month. Katerina Lisenkova, who is also a volunteer helping Ukrainians come to the UK, said they had applied for a visa for the pair on 21 March and, although the mother received one “quickly”, the daughter had not and both had been stranded in Poland. Hours after the Observer raised the case with the government last Friday, the daughter received permission to travel to the UK. On Saturday, British sponsors described being at their “wits’ end” after a Ukrainian mother who was due to stay in their home received a visa but her children, including a four-year-old daughter, were left waiting. Lisenkova said she was aware of 700 applications under the Homes for Ukraine scheme that had still not received a response, many dating from when the scheme was launched. The whistleblower is employed by a Paris-based multinational called Teleperformance, which also owns consular services company TLScontact. The latter has been criticised for promoting paid services to Ukrainians applying for visas. The source, who has been working on the scheme’s hotline for a month, said: “So far I have had two phone calls from Ukrainian women in tears who say their experiences have left them feeling that they won’t be welcomed by the UK government and therefore they don’t want to come here any more. That’s tough when you hear that.” He claimed that calls from potential sponsors and applicants to the Homes for Ukraine scheme rarely appeared to be recorded. “I’ve taken one call since I’ve been here out of hundreds, possibly thousands, in which it said ‘recording’ before the person came through, the source said. “I used to work on the Covid 119 lines, where everything was recorded. “The Covid line was far more structured: there was a very fixed set of rules, with lots of information for us. On the Ukrainian line, we have no information.” However, he said Teleperformance was not entirely to blame for the problems relating to the Ukrainian scheme, because the firm was essentially working to the specifications of the UK government. “Teleperformance is the client. It is just fulfilling whatever it is that’s asked of them.” But he said any complaints to the firm’s management appeared to be ignored: “We get zero response and if there is an attempt to tweak it or make it better, we are certainly not told about it. Communication is nonexistent.” The resultant sentiment among staff, the source said, was frustration. “Colleagues I’ve spoken to feel the same way. We are all feeling pretty exasperated,” he added. The scheme’s helpline aims to guide applicants through the sponsor process and help them with inputting the data required for a successful outcome. However, the government has the final say who gets a visa and is allowed to enter the UK. A government spokesperson said that, when combined with its Ukraine Family Scheme, a total of 71,800 visas had been granted, with 21,600 Ukrainians arriving in the UK. They added: “We are processing thousands of visas a day – this shows that the changes we made to streamline the service are working and we will continue to build on this success so we can speed up the process even further.”",News/World news,Homes For Ukraine whistleblower says UK refugee scheme is ‘designed to fail’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/23/homes-for-ukraine-whistleblower-says-uk-refugee-scheme-is-designed-to-fail
4/24/2022,"The north London derby on 12 May looms ever larger for Tottenham. Just when it seemed fourth place and a return to the Champions League was within their grasp, they revert to unreliable type. Spurs handed back the advantage to Arsenal by making it just a single point collected from a possible six. Way out in west London, Spurs were low on energy and cohesion, Harry Kane, Son Heung-min and Dejan Kulusevski in attack isolated from a midfield swamped by Brentford’s greater numbers and zest. It was impossible not to consider how different matters might have been had Christian Eriksen been the Tottenham playmaker supplying his former teammates a quality of chance they struggled to find all evening. Arsenal’s chaotic wins over Chelsea and Manchester United had ratcheted up the pressure. A combination of those results and last week’s defeat to Brighton left Tottenham needing victory against opposition whose plan is making life as difficult possible for their opponents. Thomas Frank’s team had won their last two London derbies in a run of five wins from six. Spurs had further capital concerns, having won just one of their last 11 London derbies. Antonio Conte had made one change from Brighton, swapping in Ryan Sessegnon for Sergio Reguilón in the left wing-back role vacated by Matt Doherty’s long-term injury. The latter, once a fringe player, appears to be sorely missed. Where pressure envelops Spurs, Brentford are in a sweet spot. Relegation is a discarded worry and Eriksen has added magic to a team willing to run through a brick wall for Thomas Frank. These are the days of their fans’ lives and Brentford had won the five previous games the Dane had started. Among the away supporters, Eriksen’s name was received with a pre-match standing ovation, a gesture repeated when he came across to take his first corner. Brentford started with typical vigour, Ivan Toney’s shot deflected wide after Sessegnon was hassled into a mistake. From an Eriksen corner, the same striker had a volleyed effort blocked as Spurs looked, in the early stages, as disjointed as they had against Brighton. Even after they began to take a greater share of possession, the tricks and flicks of Son and Kane were not paying off. Brentford pressed aggressively, those Spurs stars constantly surrounded by packs of pursuers. Set pieces continued to be problematic for Tottenham. Toney’s header crashed off Emerson Royal’s shoulder and struck the crossbar in the 18th minute as Brentford forced a series of corners – six by the 22nd minute – that caused repeated discomfort. When the sixth dropped to the back post, Toney slashed a volley wide, having been left with a free hit. Eriksen started on the left of midfield but was licensed to roam and probe with long passes of a quality that appeared beyond his former teammates, Toney’s intelligent movement giving him plenty to aim at. Conte entered the break as if in deep thought, though he had been showing his frustrations. Hugo Lloris’s casual play after kick-off suggested a doubtless strong half-time message had not hit yet home, Conte muttering angrily to himself before then applauding when his team began to start mounting actual attacks. Brentford still looked likely, Spurs panicky, with Lloris at one point charging out to tackle Toney in midfield, though that intervention preceded Tottenham’s best spell of pressure. Emerson’s cross found Kane in the box, the strike was blocked but only cleared with difficulty. The momentum then returned to Brentford as Spurs conceded a series of corners, free-kicks and throw-ins, all playing to the home side’s strengths, while the visitors struggled to land a shot on target. Eric Dier’s mistake offered Eriksen a chance to shoot and the resultant corner caused further drama in the Spurs area, Kane having to head Pontus Jansson’s header off the line before Eriksen’s snap-shot was smuggled clear. Spurs had the greater need, they pushed harder in the latter stages, Brentford unsurprisingly drained by their efforts. Conte prowled, chucking on Lucas Moura to try to find a winner. It did not come, and had it done so, would have been undeserved. It was Toney who went closest in heading an Eriksen free-kick down against the post in injury time, though Kane also whistled an overhead past the post. In being outrun and outfought twice in a week, Spurs have allowed their destiny to slip from their hands.",Sport/Football,Antonio Conte cuts frustrated figure as toothless Tottenham draw at Brentford,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/23/brentford-tottenham-premier-league-match-report
4/24/2022,"When Pavel Tkachev heard about the special lessons on the war in Ukraine that took place at his son’s high school in the Primorksy district of St Petersburg earlier this month, he was livid. “I called them and said this is ridiculous,” he told the Observer. “We’re the parents and it is we who should tell the kids about patriotism and the ‘special operation’, not the schools.” Similar lectures were delivered to students in schools across the country, decrying “fascists” in Ukraine and suggesting that Russia was acting in “self-defence”. Tkachev said he was particularly angry over comparisons to the second world war, which he called “unforgivable”. School officials “shrugged their shoulders and said these are the instructions”, he said. “I was disgusted.” Russia’s plans to overhaul education have gone hand-in-hand with its war in Ukraine. Officials are writing curricula to justify the invasion, and have suggested schools will hold flag-raisings and sing the national anthem each morning from September. A major Russian textbook publisher is reportedly using autochecking software to edit out positive references to Ukraine in its schoolbooks. According to Russia’s education ministry, history will become a compulsory subject from the first grade. “We will never allow it [to be written] that we somehow treated other nations – our fraternal nations of Ukraine and Belarus – poorly,” said education minister Sergey Kravtsov, who announced the new initiative at the opening of an exhibition called “Everyday Nazism”. “We will do everything in our power so that historical memory is preserved.” There is a clear degree of political opportunism in using schoolchildren to deliver propaganda. As Russia declared a disputed victory in Mariupol last week, Andrei Turchak, head of the ruling United Russia party, made a beeline for a local school in the city. While there, he told the students: “Victory will be ours. The enemy will be defeated, and peaceful life on this earth will finally come … we will liberate this territory and clean it from the fascist demons.” But there is also a new level of pressure on teachers, sometimes to organise pro-war photo-ops with children, or in other cases to hide their anti-war feeling from their students. “I know a lot of teachers who have hidden their online profiles, they’re very careful speaking about politics in school,” said Maria, a teacher at a middle school in Voronezh. Lyubov Zhiltsova, a maths teacher and politician from Pskov, faced a police inquest last week for an image on social media of her holding a sign that said “No to war”. “The whole world has turned upside down for me. I prepare events for 9 May [Victory Day] every year, I write a script, I rehearse … And now how can I talk about it with children?” she told Radio Svoboda. “I couldn’t keep silent, I was burning.” One of the first Russians to be targeted under a new law banning “fakes” about the Russian military was a schoolteacher who now faces 10 years in prison. “I hoped to break through the propaganda that is being fed to this country. But look where it got me,” Irina Gen, a 55-year-old English and German language teacher said this month. She was reported by her own students. Educational officials have promised further changes to Russia’s curriculum and new patriotic initiatives clearly inspired by the war. Some, such as the flag and anthem, seem inspired by similar rightwing efforts in the United States. Others are specific to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Kravtsov told Putin last week that they had already begun developing lessons about the “goals of the special operation – to help our people, denazification, the demilitarisation of Donbas”. The goal was to fight the “squall of disinformation … fakes about Russia”. The lessons have “conditionally been called ‘Conversations about important topics’”. “And from 1 September, in addition, there will be the raising of the national flag at the beginning of the school week, the performance of the national anthem,” he said. Leaked manuals for this year’s special lectures have shown that Russian teachers are being told to tell students that Russia has not invaded Ukraine, but is instead practising “self-defence against the threats created to us and from an even greater calamity than what is happening today”. In a separate lesson on “anti-Russian sanctions”, teachers are told to ask students whether the sanctions are fair, whether they’ll actually strengthen the Russian economy, and whom will they harm (everyone). “The teacher, together with the students, concludes that economic policy in recent years has been aimed at increasing the protection of domestic producers, ensuring its sustainability in the face of external crises,” the documents read. The lessons manuals, or metodichki, are so far not compulsory, noted Denis Lanshchikov, a history teacher at a private school in Moscow. But many teachers and administrators at state schools appeared to have leaned into them of their own volition, either because they supported the war or because they thought “big brother is watching”. “It seems to me that it isn’t yet a top-down attempt to make schools totalitarian,” he said. “But then every person … creates this totalitarianism himself.” Even grade-school students are facing some level of indoctrination. “In all the schools they held these special events dedicated to the topic that Russia is fighting with fascists,” said Marina Litvinovich, an opposition politician in Moscow. In her son’s fourth-grade class, the children were given a “light version”. “They don’t quite get it. So they went through the [second world war] Leningrad blockade – and during the lesson they also said that ‘look, this is how Russia is continuing to fight against fascism’.” “The kids are kind of cool toward it,” she said of her son. She compared it to the indoctrination that she went through as a student in the late Soviet period, saying: “When the Soviet Union fell, all this indoctrination flew away … so I’m not extremely worried about it, it will fly away when they meet reality. It’s bad but not a catastrophe.”",News/World news,Lessons in patriotism used to justify Ukraine invasion to Russia’s children,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/23/lessons-in-patriotism-used-to-justify-ukraine-invasion-to-russias-children
