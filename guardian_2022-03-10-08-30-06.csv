3/10/2022,"Mark Wood offered an honest appraisal of England’s first outing with the ball in Antigua, admitting it felt “weird” without Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad and the seam attack possibly tried too hard to prove a point in their absence. An adjustment period was always likely after the record-breaking pair were left at home but this is the exact scenario that Andrew Strauss, interim director of cricket, and Joe Root, the captain, hope will see others to step up in leadership roles. Four West Indies wickets in their first 66.5 overs and a profligate opening burst from Chris Woakes and Craig Overton underlined the size of the challenge but Wood, the standout seamer with figures of one for 24 from 12 overs after overcoming last week’s stomach bug, was determined that day three will see this corrected. Wood said: “We maybe tried a little bit too hard, with the void of Anderson and Broad we wanted to try hard and prove we could do it. Of course it’s weird [without them]. It’s obviously going to be talked about because they are legends. But we just have to admit we didn’t get it right to start with and we’ll be out to get it right next time. “We were all a bit inconsistent, we didn’t get our lengths quite right and we were a little bit too full or too short. But actually I thought we came back really well.” There was also a missed opportunity in the morning session, with England resuming on 268 for six but bowled out for 311 as the tail failed to support Jonny Bairtow. Wood accepted his culpability here, the No 10 caught off the top edge for one attempting to pull Alzarri Joseph before he was set. Wood added: “As bowlers we work really hard on our batting and I think we could have stuck with Jonny a little bit more. I was disappointed with my shot. “We could have got even more runs. From 48 for four, you think 311 is a really good total. But overnight we were hoping for more. It’s something to work on.”",Sport/Sport,‘It’s weird’: Mark Wood admits feeling absence of Anderson and Broad,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/09/its-weird-mark-wood-admits-feeling-absence-of-anderson-and-broad
3/10/2022,"Niue has reported its first case of Covid-19, becoming the second island in the Pacific to lose its Covid-zero status within a week. The Niuean government says the case arrived on a flight from New Zealand, with 26 other passengers on Monday. The travellers tested negative for the virus prior to departing. “The positive case is currently in quarantine and will be monitored closely by Niue’s health officials,” its premier Dalton Tagelagi said. “We understand at this stage that the positive case is double vaccinated and boosted and had returned a negative PCR test 72 hours and RATs before boarding their flight from New Zealand.” Tagelagi said the country has been expecting the virus and preparing for it. “We are ready to contain its spread. We have remained vigilant; we have caught this case – and now I ask you to remain vigilant too,” Tagelagi urged Niueans. The nation, which has a population of just under 2,000 people, has a high vaccination rate – 97% of those aged 16 and over, and 98% for those between 12-16 years old. “Our extremely high vaccination rate is another factor in our favour, as it slows the spread of transmission and reduces the health impacts in those who do contract this virus.” Officials deemed to have come in close contact with the positive case are now isolating and will be closely monitored and tested. All other passengers have returned a negative test but will be retested on day three, the premier said. Niue is the second island to record its first case this week. New Zealand’s Chatham Islands, which is 800 kilometres off the mainland’s east coast and one of the most remote inhabited places in the world, also reported its first case over the weekend. The World Health Organization says there are just eight other countries that have not reported any Covid-19 cases including Tuvalu, Tokelau, Saint Helena, Pitcairn Islands, Nauru, and Federated States of Micronesia. Turkmenistan and North Korea also report zero cases, but the organisation has cast doubt over these claims.",News/World news,Niue becomes second Pacific island in a week to lose Covid-free status,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/10/niue-becomes-second-pacific-island-in-a-week-to-lose-covid-free-status
3/10/2022,"Floods and their causes are complicated and there has been a clamour for answers from Australians over the role global heating could have played in the devastation left along the east coast this week. But one thing several of Australia’s conservative commentators are sure about is that the climate crisis had nothing to do with it. On Sky News, Chris Kenny said Australia “always has, and always will have” floods, droughts and fires and, “allowing for some records”, the country had been through worst cases of those extremes before. In the pages of the Herald Sun last Thursday, Andrew Bolt described how a set of “green journalists” were acting like “vultures” for “exploiting” the floods. “This pathetic game of climate porn happens every time we get some natural disaster, wet or dry, fires or floods,” Bolt thundered. Almost two weeks ago, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its latest assessment of the impacts of climate change. In interviews, IPCC authors in Australia said it was likely that rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere had played a role in the extreme rainfall that led to flooding. “But hang on! Just a year ago this same IPCC suggested the opposite,” Bolt said. Bolt claimed that last year’s IPCC report that looked at the core science of climate change had found heavy downpours tended to “decrease over the eastern and southern regions” of the country. But this statement was referring to observations of the past, not the likely impacts in the future. The same report included a fact sheet – not mentioned by Bolt – on findings for the Australian region, which said eastern Australia should expect “more extreme rainfall events” as the world warms. Bolt wrote that climate change had been linked to drought, fires and now floods – as if climate change can’t have multiple affects. “We can’t afford this con any more,” he said. Prof Mark Howden, director of the Australian National University’s Institute for Climate, Energy and Disaster Solutions, is ​​vice-chair of the IPCC working group that wrote the latest report. He told Temperature Check: “The basic relationships between air temperature and moisture holding capacity and the linkage of this to extreme storms and floods are well known and have been for centuries. The projection of increased flood risk as atmospheric and ocean temperatures rise is robust.” He said it would be wrong to ignore the role of climate cycles such as La Niña and El Niño on the risk of flooding and droughts, but “as is ignoring the basic physics which ties in the common factors between droughts and floods. This is climate science 101.” Bolt rarely likes people to attribute anything to climate change but seemed unusually confident about one thing in his column. Pointing to a record winter crop this year across Australia (but not pointing to how record November rainfall had caused widespread downgrades of wheat quality in New South Wales), Bolt wrote: “Global warming has actually been brilliant for our farmers.” So in the same column Bolt argues both for and against attributing changes in weather conditions to climate change. Global warming is apparently only a thing when it’s doing something good. But to the question of whether global warming is “good for farmers”. Really? Back to the IPCC, which said last week it had “high confidence” that hotter and drier conditions would disrupt future agricultural production. And what about flooding? The NSW Farmers chief executive, Pete Arkle, told Temperature Check: “While there may be beneficial changes to some commodities in some areas in the short term, when we look more broadly at the trends and the impact of extreme weather events it is hard to be optimistic about the impact of climate change. “Farmers are among those most exposed to the full impact of extreme weather, be that bushfires, floods or droughts. It is critical we take steps to minimise the impact of climate on agriculture, because we will all be impacted if there is reduced food security.” There has been much conservative commentary in the past week over Russia’s bloody invasion of Ukraine, with some weaving a narrative that Europe’s pursuit of renewable energy and emissions reductions gave Putin the confidence to wage war (opportunistic, much?). On Radio National’s Between the Lines, Tom Switzer invited Rupert Darwall on to talk about how the war might change commitments to net zero. Anyone who suggested the world could do without fossil fuels was “out with the fairies”, said Darwall, presumably including the International Energy Agency and its detailed analysis of pathways to net zero among that throng of fantasists. Switzer introduced Darwall as a researcher at the RealClearFoundation and twice mentioned he was “the author of The Age of Global Warming, a History”. That book was published in 2013 and, while the benign title might not give it away, the book has been celebrated by climate science denialist groups. Odd that Switzer didn’t mention Darwall’s 2017 book with a rather less benign title: Green Tyranny: Exposing the Totalitarian Roots of the Climate Industrial Complex.",News/Environment,What are conservative commentators saying about the floods and climate? | Temperature Check,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/10/what-are-conservative-commentators-saying-about-the-floods-and-climate
3/10/2022,"The Russian invasion of Ukraine is causing a paradigm shift on the scale of 9/11 in how democracy will confront future threats, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, will predict in Washington on Thursday. She will call for the west to stand up to authoritarian regimes, saying the west must rise to this moment and pledge that it must never allow such aggression to grow unchecked as it had over the past decade. In previous remarks, she has qualified her attacks on authoritarian regimes by saying some regimes that do not intend to undermine the west can be treated differently. No 10, pressed on Wednesday on whether it regarded Saudi Arabia as an authoritarian regime, hedged. In her speech to the Atlantic Council, Truss will say: “Putin has launched a full-frontal assault not just on the Ukrainian people, but also on the very foundation of our societies and the rules by which we coexist – sovereignty, democracy, the UN charter. “He has shattered the architecture of global security. The invasion of Ukraine is a paradigm shift on the scale of 9/11. How we respond today will set the pattern for this new era. “If we let Putin’s expansionism go unchallenged it would send a dangerous message to would-be aggressors and authoritarians around the world. We can’t allow that to happen. “We must start with the principle that the only thing aggressors understand is strength … and we must start by working together to stop Putin’s offensive in Ukraine.” She will insist: “That means acting now. It means being tough – because we know that the costs will only rise if we don’t. The public understands the gravity of this moment. They see the terrible suffering caused by this pre-planned, barbaric and illegal invasion against a European democracy and they recognise that the world has changed.” She will again call for ending strategic dependence on hostile and authoritarian states, citing the threat posed by Russian energy. In remarks that are largely directed at countries that are most dependent on Russian energy, such as Italy and Germany, she will say: “We must go further on sanctions to keep tightening the vice – including a full Swift ban, freezing all Russian banking assets, and encouraging more countries to join the effort.” Germany has been pressing for Russian energy-related banks to be kept within the Swift banking system. Truss will say: “We want a situation where they can’t access their funds, they can’t clear their payments, their trade can’t flow, their ships can’t dock and their planes can’t land. We must work together to ensure justice is done at the International Criminal Court and Putin is held to account for his actions. “And we must do more to deliver defensive weapons and respond to the growing humanitarian emergency. We will do all of this. And we will shape this new era for global security.” Truss is also expected to deliver a message to the US Congress that the UK is acting against Russian oligarchs following mounting criticism amongst US politicians and media outlets that the UK has laid out the welcome mat for the oligarchs and is now finding it difficult, mainly for legal reasons, to take the tough action being shown by the EU and the US. The UK is passing legislation that will allow it to sanction anyone in the UK jurisdiction so long as they have been sanctioned by the US, Canada or the EU, a move that is some distance from the original claim by Brexiters that a distinct UK sanctions regime would make the UK regime more agile. It instead appears that the Foreign Office fears the UK legislation, due to amendments passed by parliament, provides too many avenues through which Russian oligarchs can appeal sanction designations in the courts.",News/Politics,"Ukraine war marks paradigm shift on the scale of 9/11, says Liz Truss",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/09/ukraine-war-marks-paradigm-shift-on-the-scale-of-911-says-liz-truss
3/10/2022,"Thomas Tuchel believes Andreas Christensen will be making a mistake if he leaves Chelsea on a free this summer and says his players can “fulfil any dream” by staying at the club. Christensen has not signed a new contract and, with his terms expiring in June, can agree a deal elsewhere. Reports suggest he is close to joining Barcelona but Tuchel cannot comprehend why the centre-back would depart and thinks he should blossom at the club he joined as an academy player at 16. “There is no need to go now because he is right at the edge to finally take the next one, two, three steps at Chelsea,” the manager said. “I don’t think he is done here. “That is why I strongly recommended him not to go before it is done. And it is clearly not done. He now has a situation given the formation, given the partners at his side, given his status, given his age: this is his moment. And I cannot understand if he leaves exactly at this moment.” Tuchel sounded resigned to Christensen’s departure, saying the 25-year-old’s future was “in doubt, we hear the rumours” and Chelsea are “not happy about it”. He continued: “For Andreas we have unbelievably much to offer. It is the club where he came through the academy and I think he has a lot, also, to appreciate where he is right now. He profited a lot from the support, the structure. Now is the crucial moment to step up and be a huge player with this history.” Asked whether historical giants such as Barcelona and Bayern Munich offered better prospects for footballers than Chelsea, Tuchel said: “There cannot be a big improvement in any other club in terms of organisation, the supporting level for the players, the mentality, the competition in which you play: I don’t see an upgrade in any other club. Of course if you want to have the challenge of a new league and maybe also in money there are some possibilities always available if you’re a top, top player. But you can fulfil any dream here: I think we should not hide from that and we should not be too humble in that.” Chelsea travel to the Premier League’s bottom club, Norwich, who they beat 7-0 in October, on Thursday as they seek a fourth straight league win. Reece James is doubtful with what Tuchel described as “muscular problems” and could face a spell out. “We are worried,” he said. “A setback for sure – I hope not a big one.”",Sport/Football,‘You can fulfil any dream here’: Tuchel urges Christensen to stay at Chelsea,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/09/you-can-fulfil-any-dream-here-tuchel-urges-christensen-to-stay-at-chelsea
