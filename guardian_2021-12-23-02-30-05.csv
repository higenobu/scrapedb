12/23/2021,"The world will have enough doses of Covid vaccines early next year to inoculate all of the global adult population – if western countries do not hoard those vaccines to use in blanket booster programmes, the head of the World Health Organization has said. , Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Wednesday there would be sufficient supplies of vaccine in global circulation in the first quarter of 2022.  “Blanket booster programmes are likely to prolong the Covid-19 pandemic, rather than ending it, by diverting supply to countries that already have high levels of vaccination coverage, giving the virus more opportunity to spread and mutate,” Tedros said, adding: “No country can boost its way out of the pandemic.” His remarks follow predictions by officials with the WHO’s Africa region earlier this month that African countries should receive almost a billion doses within the same timeframe. Tedros’s comments came as the WHO epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhovesaid the organisation was considering reclassifying earlier variants of Covid-19 – including the Alpha, Beta and Gamma strains – as they appeared to be no longer in circulation. However, Kerkhove cautioned against recent reports – including from South Africa – that suggested the Omicron variant spreading around the world may be less severe than previous strains, saying there was still insufficient data to make a judgment. “We have not seen this variant circulate for long enough in populations around the world, certainly in vulnerable populations,” Kerkhove said. She said the data on the new variant, first identified in southern Africa and Hong Kong in November, was still “messy” as countries reported its arrival and spread. The projections on global vaccine supply come as new vaccines and treatments have been authorised for use against Covid and the focus has moved to ensuring the world’s poorer countries are supported with materials and vaccine commodities such as syringes, which are in short supply, to accelerate rollouts. With Omicron spreading at unprecedented speed and already detected in 106 countries, Tedros said on Wednesday the existing vaccines continue to provide significant protection against severe disease. “It’s important to remember that the vast majority of hospitalisations and deaths are in unvaccinated people, not unboosted people,” he said. He also stressed people should take necessary precautions to halt the spread of Covid heading into the Christmas period. “Boosters cannot be seen as a ticket to go ahead with planned celebrations,” he said. Tedros’s comments on increasing global vaccination follows the publication earlier on Wednesday of a report by the WHO’s strategic advisory group of experts on immunisation that said at least 126 countries around the world had already issued recommendations on boosters or additional vaccine doses, and 120 had started implementing those programmes. “No low-income country has yet introduced a booster vaccination programme,” it said in a statement. “In view of the continued supply uncertainties in global vaccine access and equity, individual country vaccine booster dose policy decisions need to balance the public health benefits to their population with support for global equity in vaccine access necessary to address the virus evolution and pandemic impact. “Of concern are broad-based booster programmes, including the booster vaccination of population sub-groups at lower risk of severe disease. “Global supply is increasing significantly and is projected to be sufficient for vaccination of the entire adult population globally, and boosters of high-risk populations (as defined in the roadmap, in particular older adults and immunocompromised persons), by the first quarter of 2022. “However, projections show that only later in 2022 supply will be sufficient for extensive use of boosters in all adults, and beyond, should they be broadly needed.”",News/World news,WHO boss: Covid booster drives likely to prolong pandemic,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/22/who-boss-covid-booster-drives-likely-prolong-pandemic
12/23/2021,"Police investigating the disappearance of a 20-year-old man after he visited a nightclub in central London last week have begun searching the River Thames after reviewing CCTV footage. Scotland Yard said the search for Harvey Parker was ordered after officers found footage suggesting he may have “entered the water” near the Golden Jubilee pedestrian bridge that links Embankment to Waterloo. In a statement, it added: “At this stage of the investigation there is nothing to suggest that there is any third-party involvement.”  Parker, from Lambeth in south London, was seen leaving Heaven Nightclub alone near Charing Cross Railway Station in Westminster at about 2.15am last Friday. DCI Lucy O’Connor, of the central south safeguarding unit, said: “We are doing all we can to find Harvey, and working closely with our colleagues in the marine policing unit.” She added: “We are keeping Harvey’s family fully informed of any developments; and the thoughts of my colleagues and I are with them at this distressing time. We would also ask that media avoid any speculation while the inquiry continues.” On Tuesday police released CCTV images of Parker after he left the nightclub. They showed him then entering Craven Street and walking south towards the Embankment. He has not been seen since. DS Dick Nation, also of the central south safeguarding unit, said: “This is a terrible ordeal for Harvey’s family and friends and I would urge anyone who saw him or has any information to contact police immediately.” The Theatre Royal Stratford East tweeted that Parker was a front-of-house member of staff and issued an appeal for help to find him.

12/23/2021,"The three-times BDO world champion Glen Durrant fell at the first hurdle at the PDC world championship on Wednesday, the No 24 seed slipping to a 3-0 defeat against Ireland’s William O’Connor. Durrant, who won the BDO title in 2017, 2018 and 2019 and was the 2020 Premier League champion, has been struggling with his action – “Like a golfer having the yips,” he told the Guardian in an interview this week – and came into the match on the back of 27 defeats in his last 28 matches stretching back to March.  But there was to be no miracle turnaround in form at Alexandra Palace, Durrant winning just one leg and averaging 80.45 in a second-round defeat. O’Connor advances to the third round, where he will face the No 9 seed, Michael Smith. Elsewhere in the afternoon session, the No 13 seed Joe Cullen produced a rousing comeback from 2-1 down to beat the dangerous Jim Williams 3-2. “To have the crowd behind me is great. I’m just happy to win to be honest. Jim played well to get in front and I did well to come back,” said Cullen, who won in front of fans at the Ally Pally for the first time since 2017.“My record here is terrible so to play that well and to win in front of that brilliant crowd means everything to me. If I’m honest I think I might have lost that game a few years ago but I’m a little more experienced now and that’s why I came back to win.” There were 3-0 whitewash wins for the No 15 seed, Ryan Searle, against William Borland (who had produced a nine-dart finish to win his first-round match) and Luke Humphries over Rowby-John Rodriguez of Austria.

12/23/2021,"Frontline doctors have issued desperate pleas for more people to get vaccinated after reporting that in some hospitals all new intensive care Covid patients have not had jabs. An estimated 5 million people, or 10% of the eligible population, have not had been inoculated, and it is this group who are seemingly draining the most resources from overstretched hospitals, experts say.  The problem is worst in parts of London, but Cambridge’s Royal Papworth hospital said more than 80% of its Covid patients requiring the most care were unjabbed. Will Ricketts, a consultant chest physician at the Royal London hospital, tweeted on Wednesday: “Every new respiratory admission with Covid since Friday has been unvaccinated.” On Sunday he had said nearly every patient on the Covid wards and every patient he had referred to intensive care was unvaccinated. He pleaded: “We’re not here to judge (my day job is lung cancer), but please help us to help you please #GetVaccinatedNow.” A source for Barts health trust said: “The number of unvaccinated people admitted to ICU has fluctuated between 80% and 90% across the north-east London patch over the past few weeks. For our trust that includes Royal London, Barts, Whipps Cross and Newham.” On Tuesday a respiratory registrar at a west London hospital tweeted: “Every single patient in our respiratory support unit is unvaccinated … #vaccines work”. He later deleted the tweet after some accused him of breaching patient confidentiality. Prof Rupert Pearse, an intensive care doctor at the Royal London and Barts, confirmed to the BBC that up to 90% of his patients were unvaccinated. He said: “It’s very sad that people are vaccine-hesitant, but we understand the reasons, and we are happy to talk about people’s fears about getting vaccinated. There is absolutely no doubt that it’s protecting the population.” Jo-anne Fowles, a nurse consultant in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) – a procedure for providing prolonged cardiac and respiratory support – at the Royal Papworth told ITV Anglia: “82% of the patients we have treated for Covid-19 since February have been unvaccinated.” On Sunday the health secretary, Sajid Javid, said about nine out of 10 Covid patients needing the most care in hospital had not been jabbed. This figure is believed to refer to those requiring ECMO, according to Anthony Masters, an ambassador for the Royal Statistical Society. He said information provided by NHS England showed that of the 154 Covid patients receiving ECMO between July to November, 141 , or 92%, were unvaccinated. The UK Health Security Agency’s latest vaccine surveillance showed that of the 3,087 people who died of Covid in England in the three weeks before 6 December, 718 were unvaccinated, or about 23%. Prof Jim McManus, the president of the Association of Directors of Public Health, cautioned against more regular publication of data on the health outcomes for unvaccinated people – as seen in the US – unless it could be put in context. He said: “I’m not sure those figures would prod a lot of people to get vaccinated, because it could get accidentally or deliberately misinterpreted. Some will seize on the fact that vaccinated people are in hospital to suggest the vaccines don’t work.” He added: “There will be vaccinated people in hospital as a matter of basic arithmetic. Before Omicron, the vaccines were around 96% effective at protecting against hospitalisation. But 4% of 1 million people represents 40,000 people. So if you look at the sheer numbers without looking at the proportions involved, it can look like the vaccine isn’t having an effect. But there is a much higher proportion of those who are unvaccinated ending up in hospital. If the statistics were put in context, it could really help.” The chief executive of NHS Providers, Chris Hopson, said: “We would strongly encourage everyone who is eligible to get jabbed or boosted, and to think about how they can reduce the risk of infection. “Trust leaders consistently tell us that most of the Covid-19 patients they are seeing are unvaccinated. We don’t hold data on that, but it’s a recurring theme and a source of frustration, not least because of the potential impact on other patients whose treatment may be delayed as a result.”",News/Society,‘Help us to help you’: doctors in England make pleas to unvaccinated,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/22/help-us-to-help-you-doctors-in-england-make-pleas-to-unvaccinated
12/23/2021,"Whether you’re a citizen, consumer or investor, the ability to call out greenwashing is fast becoming a key life skill. Misleading or unsubstantiated claims about climate credentials can make it harder for people to make informed decisions. They can also undermine genuine efforts by companies to clean up their act and tackle the climate crisis. The basic problem is a lack of clarity. Indeed, when it comes to spotting greenwashing, it can actually be more helpful to focus on the colour grey – because it’s the many grey areas that have helped make greenwashing so endemic. These grey areas might be around measurements, definitions, best practice, standards or regulations. Even the language we use is very imprecise, leaving lots of room for vagueness, obfuscation or outright deception. For instance, what do words such as “green”, “sustainable” and “eco” even mean?  These problems are increasingly important when it comes to the greenwashing of investment products, such as pensions and investment funds. In recent years, there has been a sharp rise in consumer demand for funds that invest according to environmental, social and governance criteria, often referred to as ESG funds. According to the financial data provider Morningstar, the value of assets held in UK funds that invest according to stringent environmental and social principles grew from £29bn at the beginning of 2017 to £71bn by the end of 2020. With that much money at stake, misleading claims can effectively hamper the flow of money and resources into genuinely green initiatives and businesses – thwarting global efforts to tackle the climate emergency. Part of the problem is the relative nascency of the responsible investment industry. “There have been a lot of new entrants into the market and a lot of innovation,” says Ashley Hamilton Claxton, head of Responsible Investment at Royal London Asset Management, part of the Royal London Group. “I describe it as the ‘teenage years’ of responsible investing, with a lot of experimentation and boundary testing, and a lot of people trying out new things.” The name gameAs with the “green” labels so often stamped on supermarket products, language and definitions are crucial when it comes to responsible investment products. Hamilton Claxton says it’s important to understand a fund’s actual objectives. Is it aiming to invest in companies with good ESG credentials, or in companies that offer solutions to the world’s biggest challenges? A fund with a climate theme may not invest solely in green companies – it may invest in companies that don’t necessarily have strong green credentials today, but have the intention and the plans to improve their environmental profile. “Investors should be really conscious of fund names, because the name doesn’t always explain what the fund is doing,” says Hamilton Claxton. “You need to look under the hood at the fund’s holdings and ESG characteristics. Don’t just rely on the fund name, because you can be misled, as different asset managers will use the same name or label in very different ways.” As well as launching new products, some existing funds have been rebadged as sustainable; effectively marking a change to the fund’s name or description without the investments changing. “There is a lot of rebadging of existing investment funds,” says Hamilton Claxton. “You need to look at the list of companies the fund is investing in – the top 10 holdings are normally available publicly on the company’s website – and this will enable you to see whether the fund’s name has changed, but the holdings haven’t.” Bad faith, hypocrisy or inconsistency?It’s worth noting that fund managers themselves have to be on guard against greenwashing when they examine which companies a fund should invest in. The lack of agreed ESG standards with metrics and comparable data means asset managers have to rely a lot more on their judgment and expertise rather than on audited numbers and financial analysis. Sometimes it’s relatively easy to know when a company is acting in bad faith – for instance, when it pays lip service to sustainability with a particular product or marketing campaign while deliberately dragging its heels on the carbon emissions from the bulk of its operations. But things aren’t always so clear-cut. A company’s inconsistent behaviour might not necessarily mean hypocrisy. For instance, the transition to clean energy may simply be easier and therefore faster in one area of its businesses than in others. Asset managers have to determine whether or not such inconsistencies constitute greenwashing. Other variables to consider might include, for example, the actual timeframe for a company’s net zero targets, or whether it takes into account the emissions in its wider supply chain – which can often account for the bulk of a company’s actual emissions. Likewise, do its emission-reduction ambitions involve an excessive use of carbon offsets? These refer to projects that reduce or remove emissions, such as planting new forests. Carbon offsets are necessary for some sectors such as the airline industry, whose core business involves emitting carbon – thereby making it impossible for them to reach net-zero without offsets. But offsets can be controversial when businesses use them as shortcuts to avoid making their operations more sustainable. Check the voting recordFor individual investors who are trying to assess the ESG credentials of investment products marketed as responsible or ethical investment funds, Hamilton Claxton advises checking the voting record of the asset manager who oversees the fund. Voting at annual shareholder meetings is one of the most visible ways that asset managers engage with the companies they invest in – whether it’s on climate-related resolutions, or other proposals involving an environmental or social issue. “The first step is to find out whether the fund manager is actually disclosing how they vote,” she says. “At Royal London we disclose our voting record.” Royal London is a mutual company owned by its members. “The second [step] is to look at how they have actually been voting, and whether that is in line with your expectation as a client.” Investors should also be paying attention to what asset managers themselves are doing and saying about their own business, and whether they are walking the talk. Are they taking a sticking plaster approach to key ESG issues, or is it authentically embedded in the running of the business, and in the investment beliefs and philosophy of the asset managers? Choosing a fund management company that has a solid track record can provide reassurance to investors. “My advice to investors would be to work with partners and fund management brands that you trust, that have been doing this for a long time, and therefore have that authenticity,” says Hamilton Claxton, Regulate the greyAlthough the responsible investment industry is still in a phase of experimentation when it comes to standards, rules and practices, the potential for misleading claims and substandard funds should decrease as grey areas become more black and white. With financial watchdogs around the world introducing new rules on environmental reporting, attempts to greenwash investment products will become much more difficult. For instance, under new standards announced by the UK government in October, asset managers, investment providers, and pension schemes will have to disclose the environmental impact of the activities they finance, and justify any sustainability claims they make to investors. “The lack of common definitions around environmental sustainability is leading to greenwashing, misleading investors and consumers about how green a product really is,” the Treasury stated when it announced the new rules. “The new Sustainability Disclosure Requirements (SDR) will ensure investors have the information they need to make informed decisions about where to put their money.” Likewise, efforts to standardise the carbon offset market should help investors judge when offsets are used for greenwashing purposes. The introduction of new rules such as these gives Hamilton Claxton cause for hope on the scourge of greenwashing. “Implementing the new regulations will present challenges for asset managers, however, the industry associations are already coming together to create more consistent language and standards,” she says. “The next 18 months or so will continue to be tricky in terms of greenwashing, but beyond that I think we will start to see more standardisation in the industry and as the market becomes a bit more mature things will start to settle down.” Learn more about responsible investing by heading to Royal London – The Invested Generation",The invested generation,What does ‘eco’ even mean?

12/23/2021,"How do you persuade a company to stop polluting rivers, reduce its carbon footprint or tackle the mistreatment of workers in its supply chain? If you’re a consumer, you might choose to vote with your wallet and boycott the company in question. However, if you’re a shareholder, selling your shares in protest may not be quite as effective. You might end up simply passing the problem on to other shareholders, while also forgoing the chance to pressure the company into addressing the underlying issues.  An alternative approach is to use dialogue and other forms of soft and not-so-soft persuasion to alter a company’s practices and behaviour. This tactic is known in the investment industry as “engagement”, and it has become the favoured method among fund managers – who invest and manage investment funds on behalf of individual investors. Fund managers and other large shareholders have long used engagement tactics when it comes to disputes about, for instance, executive pay. However, shareholder engagement has become more prominent in recent years as investors increasingly focus on the social and environmental impacts of the companies they invest in. “Companies are not … perfect,” says Julia Dreblow, founder of SRI Services and Fund EcoMarket, which both provide information on sustainable investment. “Investors need to send them very clear signals to redirect their R&D [research and development] projects and change what they are doing to steer themselves on to a sustainable course.” Engagement is a broad term for tactics ranging from the relatively informal and understated – such as fund managers having regular background discussions with a company – to more high-profile and confrontational measures, such as tabling shareholder votes on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues at annual company meetings. For example, last year, Royal London Asset Management, part of the Royal London Group, sent 141 letters to companies to explain why it was voting against or abstaining on proposals at annual general meetings (AGMs). Common concerns included executive pay, energy use and climate change, and corporate governance. Engagement can take months, or even years of detailed discussions. “You need to provide evidence for your view of the world [to persuade companies to change]” says Carlota Garcia-Manas, head of engagement within the Responsible Investing team at Royal London Asset Management. “This could be a like-for-like comparison of company performances, showing that companies with more diverse boards do better.” The process often involves compromise, on both sides. More dramatically, shareholders might publicly criticise companies and agitate for change, which can make media headlines and increase pressure on a company to act. These kind of public campaigns also illustrate how investor pressure on poorly behaving companies often coincides with consumer pressure. Indeed, this is one reason why the financial case for responsible investment and the moral case have become so closely linked. For example, if a fashion retailer is using child labour in its supply chain to manufacture clothes and this is reported by the media, it may damage the company’s reputation, trigger a consumer boycott and cause a fall in the company’s share price. Similarly, investors pushing for more robust climate action might be concerned about the financial risks posed by companies that aren’t doing enough to clean up their operations, but those financial concerns are now increasingly aligned with the concerns of both ethically-minded consumers and climate-conscious governments. Whatever the impetus behind shareholder engagement, and whatever form it takes, the tactic illustrates how, by keeping a seat at the table and pushing for change, investors can wield financial power and an influential voice. Collective actionIf a company doesn’t make the suggested changes after one-on-one discussions, and the environmental or ethical matter is considered serious enough, asset management companies may cooperate with their peers and shareholder activist groups to lobby a company. Climate Action 100+ is a group representing investors that collectively manage assets worth about $60tn. It is in discussions with the world’s largest corporate greenhouse gas emitters to encourage them to take necessary action on the climate emergency. It and similar groups − including UN-convened Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance, an international group of asset managers representing $10tn of assets under management and committed to supporting the goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 − also lobby policymakers and regulators to encourage responsible investment. Collective shareholder engagement is making media headlines and sometimes leading to major changes at companies. Perhaps most dramatically, a group of shareholders teamed with the activist hedge fund Engine No1 earlier this year to oust three board members at ExxonMobil over the oil company’s progress on climate issues. However, such headline-grabbing, confrontational campaigns can require a considerable amount of time, effort and money. Most of the engagement undertaken by asset managers takes a softer, more slow-burn approach. Indeed, it is often conducted informally and not always made public. And that can make it hard to know exactly how effective shareholder engagement is, in, for example, persuading companies to adopt more ambitious plans to reduce carbon emissions. However, most investment experts believe that it’s a practical and effective tactic to make the world a better place while also improving value for shareholders who are increasingly concerned with ethics rather than just financial returns.

12/23/2021,"To invest or divest? It’s become an existential question for our times as the global effort to tackle the climate emergency increasingly involves an urgent reallocation of financial resources. As well as being asked by large corporations and governments, it’s a question faced by individual investors and pension holders who are deciding how best to invest their savings. It’s also a question that confronts the fund managers whose job it is to invest and manage investment funds on individual investors’ behalf.  The growth of responsible investing means fund managers increasingly have to factor in a company’s performance against environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria when deciding whether to invest in a business, or divest from it by selling its shares. For instance, is the company taking sufficient action to reduce its carbon emissions or other types of pollution? Are the workers in its supply chain exploited? Is it doing enough to increase diversity? These considerations are also becoming more and more closely linked with fund managers’ assessments of a company’s expected financial returns, given the economic risks posed by the climate emergency and other social crises. However, the decision about whether to invest or divest is far from simple. “You could simply exclude companies based on criteria like their carbon footprint,” explains Paola Binns, head of sterling credit at Royal London Asset Management, part of Royal London Group. “But I would argue that’s not necessarily a very useful thing to do.” Binns says the question you need to ask yourself is whether it is better to stay invested and engage with the company in order to improve its behaviour, or to sell your stake – which might make your portfolio look better, but deprives you of any ongoing influence. “We believe it’s very rarely black and white,” she continues. “If we’re talking about a utility that has polluted a waterway, we might assess what went wrong and get an explanation. We could speak to the management of the company and ask what measures they are putting in place to ensure that nothing similar happens in the future. And then we would monitor it to make sure the promised improvements take place.” Walk away from the company and you can do none of these things. In addition, other investors with fewer environmental or ethical scruples will often be happy to take your place. Engagement is, in a sense, the carrot. But there is also the question of sticks. And investors are using these too. For instance, if engagement doesn’t deliver the desired improvements on, say, carbon reductions, fund managers may decide to threaten to divest – with all the negative publicity that can entail. Indeed, some experts say that shareholder engagement is more effective with this threat. “Divestment campaigns – along with other efforts, such as political efforts to tax carbon – are crucial,” says Emilio Marti, assistant professor in the Business-Society Management Department at the Rotterdam School of Management. “They create the threats that make fossil fuel companies more open to listening to engaged shareholders.” Of course, when it comes to deciding whether to engage or divest, there are some companies that are unlikely to ever make the ESG cut. Binns says she has “one or two hard exclusions” – these comprise arms businesses and tobacco companies. However, her decisions are rarely so clear cut. “They’re never straightforward. The fact that money is diverted into greener projects is very beneficial. But then I have to weigh that into consideration with the fiduciary responsibilities that I have for my clients as well.” Another issue for fund managers is the need to properly interrogate a company’s climate actions and plans. “I’m all for green projects, but you just have to be worried about greenwashing,” says Binns. If the thinking behind “in or out” is nuanced on the ethical side, it is also complex on the financial side. Many companies could find themselves excluded on financial grounds, regardless of ethical considerations – for instance, because carbon-intensive operations also expose investors to the financial risk of regulatory clampdowns and future carbon taxes. Indeed, the value of some assets, such as certain coal mines and oil and gas fields, might therefore end up being written off entirely – becoming what investors refer to as “stranded assets”. Binns works in bonds, which means lending capital to businesses rather than buying shares. “We do systematic research on which areas of the market are lending to where the environment might be a risk to your investments. So your risk of stranded assets, for example, is really important.” Similar thinking underpinned the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth fund’s 2019 announcement that it would divest from pure play oil exploration companies to shield itself from price falls. It will, however, retain stakes in energy companies such as Shell and BP that have some renewable operations. Fund managers, such as Royal London Asset Management, often pursue both strategies at once. They might, for example, divest from oil in some of their funds that are aimed at investors who want a totally green portfolio, but retain oil assets in others. This is not a cop-out; more a recognition that there are multiple ways to achieve the same goal. “Rather than exclude companies, we want to ask them how they plan to be better in the future – and then ask ourselves if those plans are credible,” says Binns. “I think you need to take the halo off and be pragmatic – it’s about the direction of travel.” Additional reporting by Duncan Jefferies Learn more about responsible investing by heading to Royal London – The Invested Generation",The invested generation,Stay or sell?

12/23/2021,"Considering that they manage trillions of pounds, including our retirement savings, it’s surprising how little the average investor knows about asset managers. We may be vaguely aware that asset managers – sometimes referred to as fund managers – are the people at financial institutions who invest money on our behalf. But they typically stay out of the spotlight as they go about overseeing the different investment funds into which our money is pooled.  However, amid talk about a more responsible form of capitalism and a growing demand for more sustainable and ethical products generally, the role of many asset managers – and the criteria they use for investing – is shifting. As well as focusing on financial returns, asset managers are also having to consider the wider social and environmental impact of the companies included in their investment funds. Investment funds are basically baskets of financial assets such as shares and bonds. “The changing role of asset managers has been one of the most important changes in the [finance] industry during my career,” says Piers Hillier, chief investment officer at Royal London Asset Management, part of the Royal London Group. He says that, increasingly, part of the asset manager’s role is to act as an “ethical guardian” – for instance, when it comes to assessing a company’s actions to address climate change and achieve net zero carbon emissions. New kinds of investment strategies and practices seek to “deliver the returns in a more responsible way” and “help [industry] get towards net zero”, he adds. Moreover, asset managers aren’t just having to assess the environmental and social impact of the companies they invest in: there is also growing pressure on them to use their position and influence as sizeable shareholders to ensure that companies are run more ethically and transparently. That pressure comes from a variety of actors, including individual investors and pension holders, pressure groups, governments and financial regulators. Some of the pressure is also self-imposed: asset managers increasingly realise that the damage wrought by climate change or boycotts by ethically-minded consumers can pose very real financial risks. The upshot is that asset managers are now having to play a significant role in making the world a better place. That role is becoming more and more important as the fight against climate change becomes a global effort to reallocate resources and capital, and as governments take further regulatory steps to encourage the shift to a carbon-free economy. “The whole investment landscape will change,” says Julia Dreblow, founder of both SRI Services and Fund EcoMarket, which provide information on sustainable investment. “Fund managers will have to show [that] they are playing a role in helping companies reduce carbon emissions.” So how are asset managers achieving this – and providing proof of this to investors? One method is known as shareholder engagement. It’s a broad term for action ranging from informal and low-key discussions with companies to persuade them to improve their performance on environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, to more confrontational measures, including tabling shareholder votes on ESG issues at annual company meetings. “While we prefer the ‘carrot’ of engaging with companies to facilitate change, we also have the fairly large ‘stick’ of divestment,” says Hillier. That stick can often be most effective when wielded collectively by asset managers who combine forces with other investment firms and shareholder activist groups to pressure companies into acting on ESG matters. Of course, these new roles and priorities have also meant new kinds of challenges. For instance, asset managers have typically relied on robust and comparable financial data and accounting standards when measuring companies’ financial performance. But a current lack of universal standards and metrics for measuring and comparing companies’ performance on ESG issues means that asset managers have a much harder job when assessing a company’s carbon emissions and other ESG claims. It can involve more qualitative judgement than quantitative analysis – which might mean they have to spend more time visiting companies and interrogating management. Asset managers might also struggle to gauge the motivation behind a company’s ESG policies and actions, or the impact of those actions on profits. In addition, when it comes to questions of ethics and responsible behaviour, asset managers need to decide what should disqualify a particular company from being included in a responsible investment fund. For instance, what happens if a particular company is investing heavily in making a transition to cleaner and more ethical ways of operating but hasn’t quite got there yet? And which companies should you compare it with? In short, asset managers now face a raft of new and difficult dilemmas. Stepping back from these specific dilemmas, asset managers also face a more fundamental shift in how they operate. Until recently, the two basic types of investment strategy have remained broadly unchanged. They are known as “passive” and “active”. A passive investment strategy seeks to minimise buying and selling by essentially tracking a stock market index, such as the UK’s FTSE 100 or the S&P 500 index in the US. In doing so, a passive investment fund tries to match the returns of the index it tracks. The amount of money a fund invests in each company will usually be in proportion to the company’s stock market value. By contrast, an active investment strategy requires more work, judgment and action from the asset manager. Their investments, which may be more eclectic and take slightly more risks than passive funds, aim to provide better returns than passive funds that track the main share indexes. However, this broad distinction between two types of investment strategy may be becoming outdated as asset managers increasingly use shareholder engagement both to assess companies’ environmental and social impacts and also to push for improvements. In short, it requires a more “active” investment approach, even for fund managers overseeing passive funds. Effectively, they become “active passive” fund managers. “Research is showing that active passive managers are outperforming passive managers, even including the fees,” says Hillier. Going forward, the efforts of governments and financial regulators to standardise measurements should help to make the ESG performance of different companies more easily comparable. For example, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates the UK financial services industry, recently announced plans to classify and label investment products based on their sustainability characteristics. It aims to agree standards for ethical investments to make it easier for investors to understand, while helping companies transition to a more sustainable future. The FCA has also said that it expects asset managers to play their part and give their views on the plans during a consultation. As well as adhering to better regulations and improved standards, asset managers will also need to get better at communicating to investors what they are doing on ethical investment and what they want companies to do, says Dreblow. They will also need to collaborate more. “Fund managers are deeply competitive by nature, but the seriousness of climate change … means that they have to work together,” says Dreblow. “If we are going to hit net zero we can’t have some fund managers saying [that] we don’t care what companies do [about ESG].” Learn more about responsible investing by heading to Royal London – The Invested Generation",The invested generation,Responsible investing: how the role of asset managers has changed,https://www.theguardian.com/the-invested-generation/2021/dec/22/responsible-investing-how-the-role-of-asset-managers-has-changed
12/23/2021,"Trying to do the right thing can be difficult. Even if your moral compass is fine-tuned, doing right by some people can mean doing wrong by others. This can make it harder to be a responsible investor. There are many grey areas and trade-offs. Take electric vehicles. Investing in them will be better for your investment portfolio’s carbon emissions, but many electric vehicle (EV) batteries require cobalt. The mining of this precious metal is mired in controversy given the poor labour conditions in many large cobalt mines, particularly in the DRC.  Being a responsible investor means being mindful of these kinds of grey areas and unintended consequences. “The essential issue for us is that climate change is as much a socioeconomic problem as an environmental problem,” says Ashley Hamilton Claxton, head of responsible investment at Royal London Asset Management, part of the Royal London Group. The issues involved are often nuanced. And while seemingly-simple green actions might look good, they may not always be terribly effective. “I’m Canadian, by birth,” she says. “I have family who work in the tar sands industry in Alberta.” The Canadian tar sands lie under vast swathes of boreal forest. Extracting petroleum from them requires huge amounts of energy and the removal of the (often virgin) forest before you even consider the CO2 the oil will emit when burned. They are a bete noire for environmentalists, but they provide employment in remote areas. “The way that you don’t solve climate change – or get people on board to help you solve climate change – is to put them out of a job,” says Hamilton Claxton. “You will lose hearts and minds.” This is the thinking behind ideas such as “a just transition”, which many companies and investors are now proponents of. A just transition was developed by the trade unions movement, and the idea is that it provides a framework to help countries and industries (such as coal and oil) move to a sustainable, net zero, biodiverse economy, but in a way that protects jobs and livelihoods. It brings together sustainability and social justice. “We’ve been asking companies in our portfolios to come up with a just transition plan,” says Hamilton Claxton. “We want people to make a behavioural change plan, not just reallocate their capital. You might look at what you’re doing about training and repurposing sites if you close one down. What happens to local jobs? Could you transition that site to be doing something different and retain some of those jobs? How can you work with local partners, if you do have to close facilities down? The idea is to bring people along with you.” A number of companies have recently published commitments to a just transition. Scottish Power is one. Its plan takes in not just green energy but also working with customers to ensure bills do not become too onerous, and with communities to safeguard jobs. Scottish and Southern Energy is another. When its just transition plan was published last year, the company’s chief sustainability officer, Rachel McEwen, said: “The rapid move towards net zero brings a risk that some people are left behind. We are clear that it is in everyone’s interests that fairness is baked into net zero transition plans.” This type of joined-up approach is the next iteration of the move to value companies against environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria. It also answers one of the biggest criticisms of the environmental and social justice movement – that its ideals are what the commentator Rob Henderson has termed “luxury beliefs”. These, he explains in a YouTube video, are “ideas and opinions which confer status on the upper class while often inflicting costs on the lower classes”. The just transition approach is therefore more equitable and, often, more effective as it encourages communities who could lose out to the decarbonisation agenda to back measures that protect the environment, even if those measures will initially affect their primary occupation. The governance side of ESG can also throw up surprising considerations, such as the importance a company places on cybersecurity, which is essential for safeguarding their customers’ digital assets. Hamilton Claxton says: “We’ve been trying to proactively engage with companies about what they’re doing around cybersecurity and making sure they’ve got the correct sort of board-level oversight of it.” The good news for retail investors is that much of the complex thinking around ESG is done by fund managers, who decide where to allocate money, and present their research in an easy-to-understand way to consumers. However, the world of ESG investing is changing fast and will continue to do so. “I was reading something about the metaverse recently and thinking about everything from privacy to gambling addiction in a virtual world,” says Hamilton Claxton. “It’s going to be incredibly intellectually challenging from a responsible investing perspective.” Learn more about responsible investing by heading to Royal London – The Invested Generation",The invested generation,Be mindful of the grey areas – navigating the moral maze of responsible investment ,https://www.theguardian.com/the-invested-generation/2021/dec/22/be-mindful-of-the-grey-areas-navigating-the-moral-maze-of-responsible-investment
12/23/2021,"The reality of the pandemic didn’t fully sink in for India Wells until midway through Sydney’s Delta outbreak. “Within five minutes of each other there were two patients under 20, very sick, put into our most serious bays in the isolation area,” she says.  “I think anyone that was questioning whether this was real … two patients under 18 really struggling to breathe, needing high-level care, on high amounts of oxygen … That was a moment I realised that this is serious.” Wells has been a registered nurse at St Vincent’s hospital in Sydney for seven years and has worked in the emergency department for six. While she had been prepared for the pandemic, she hadn’t expected to be on the frontline of what was then the largest Covid cluster to hit New South Wales. “When the pandemic began, our emergency department split into two sections: the green zone, and we classified our isolation zone as the red zone … In July, when the Delta variant started right around the corner in Bondi, that really ramped up our Covid presentations,” Wells says. Less than two weeks after an airport limousine driver from the eastern suburbs tested positive to Delta on 16 June, cases linked to the cluster had swelled, and the greater Sydney region was locked down. Then the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, described it as the “scariest time since the pandemic started” and warned the city to prepare for rising case numbers. Expected to last seven days, the lockdown dragged out until mid-October and more than 500 people lost their lives. Wells says the experience of Delta was “extremely stressful”. “It was quite difficult separating family members from patients, their loved ones,” she says. Working in the Covid zone and the ever-evolving hygiene and sanitary practices to follow have been particularly stressful, she says. “You’re a little more isolated from the main staff department but we were constantly given education, constantly updated with the forever-changing criteria – even down to which gowns and what masks you have to wear in triage. “The nurses worked really hard keeping family members updated on the patient’s journey: whether they were confirmed Covid-positive, if they needed to stay in hospital or whether they could go home and isolate.” Wells says one key difference for health workers this year compared with 2020 was the arrival of vaccines. They rolled out the vaccination for staff members, allied health, cleaners, everyone involved in patient care,” she says. “I think I was fully vaccinated by April so we had that protection … which gave us that safety. “We have been fatigued but we’ve got great staff; the cleaners were fabulous during this time – they really held the fort for us. “We put them through extreme stress and we were so grateful for them [and] the security team for Covid transfers from our isolation zone up to the Covid wards.” It took “a whole team” to ride the Delta wave, Wells says. “Security would have to block off the hallways and the elevators, then we’d have to clean those areas,” she says. “So while everyone was stressed, this is ED, this is what we do … we all banded together and I was really proud of our team.”",News/Australia news,Life on the ward: ‘It’s difficult separating family members from loved ones’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/23/life-on-the-ward-its-difficult-separating-family-members-from-loved-ones
12/23/2021,"The federal government will pay a traditional owners corporation representing some of the poorest communities in Australia more than $2m after settling a class action that argued the remote “work for the dole” program was racist. The Community Development Program (CDP) has required about 30,000 jobseekers in remote communities to work up to 25 hours a week to receive the dole. Participants, 80% of whom were Aboriginal, were said to have faced tougher welfare penalties than those in other parts of Australia.  After sustained criticism from Indigenous leaders who claimed the program was racist and even “modern-day slavery”, Western Australia’s Shire of Ngaanyatjarraku and the Ngaanyatjarra council launched a class action in 2019 on behalf of 680 CDP participants. Following a year of confidential mediation, orders issued this month by the federal court Justice Richard White officially approved the settlement, revealing the government will pay $2m to the Ngaanyatjarra council. The court said the council “represents the interests of around 2,000 Ngaanyatjarra, Pintupi and Pitjantjatjara Traditional Owners (Yarnangu) who reside in the Ngaanyatjarra Communities”. It said it intended to use the money for an infrastructure program and an arts project at Warburton, the largest community in the area. The government also agreed to redesign the CDP scheme for jobseekers in the 10 communities covered by the class action. Without referencing the case, the Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, announced in the May budget that the government would overhaul the entire CDP. The government made no admission or concession of legal liability, while the class action members waived the right to recoup lost welfare payments or damages. The government will also pay the applicants’ costs, worth $278,897.19. The Shire of Ngaanyatjarraku president, Damien McLean, who led the action, said the government’s decision to overhaul the program was very welcome. He said the CDP program had been “just terrible”. “For communities with high costs of living and high levels of poverty, it was very difficult, very stressful,” McLean said. “That’s why we’re glad the commonwealth has had a good look at it and seen the problems it is causing.” He said the CDP required people to be “punished”, which “upended their families and their lives”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The class action represented 10 remote Aboriginal communities who told the court their residents’ per capita income was the lowest on mainland Australia. They alleged the CDP breached sections 9, 10 and 13 of the Racial Discrimination Act. The class action argued it was tougher for those in the Ngaanyatjarra communities to meet their obligations due to “remoteness of their communities, their low levels of education and literacy, and other aspects of their socio-economic status”. The communities, based in sparsely populated land near the Northern Territory and South Australia borders, first raised concerns about the program to the Australian Human Rights Commission in 2016. They filed a lawsuit when mediation at the commission failed. It is the second time in 12 months the Morrison government has settled a class action over claims its welfare programs were unlawful, after it reached a $1.8bn deal over the robodebt scandal in June. The CDP followed a similar trajectory to that scandal, with the government steadfast for years despite sustained criticism from Aboriginal leaders, the Australian National Audit Office, a former Liberal Aboriginal affairs minister and even the government’s own review, which found 36% of participants said their communities were worse off under the scheme. Northern Territory Labor MP Chansey Paech labelled the CDP “modern-day slavery” in 2018, while John Paterson of the Aboriginal Peak Organisations Northern Territory called in 2019 for the CDP to be abandoned and replaced with a “positive Aboriginal-led model”. The CDP was introduced in 2015 by the Coalition government and contracted organisations, including the Ngaanyatjarra council, to run employment services for jobseekers in remote areas under the scheme. It soon sparked outrage, with analysis showing a 740% increase in financial penalties for jobseekers compared to the previous remote job and communities program. CDP participants who failed to meet their mutual obligations requirements – such as work for the dole activities, job search or meetings with an employment services provider – had their payments docked by $50 a day. Repeated “non-compliance” could result in eight weeks without any payments. Crucially, analysis by Australian National University researchers found people in remote areas were 25 times more likely to face these penalties than those in non-remote areas. In its orders handed down this month, the federal court noted that the 680 CDP participants involved in the class action had lost $1,291,438 in welfare income, or an average of $1,793.29 a person. Taking into account the class action group definition of the lawsuit, however, the court said “the probable total” that group members could have tried to claim back was $534,628.77, an average of $786.22. Explaining his decision to approve the settlement, White said “the potential recovery for each group member … would, while no doubt significant for that group member, be modest”. There were also “risks” or “even the probability” many would not be able to make out the case they should be paid back by the government, he added. White said there was “extensive community engagement in the mediation process” which gave him confidence of “wide community support” for the settlement. McLean told Guardian Australia recouping lost welfare payments for the class action members “wasn’t on the table”. “That would have required the commonwealth to agree that the program had been discriminatory, which they insisted it hadn’t been,” he said. “Recovering individual payments … would have required a very long court action … And there would be no guarantee of success anyway.” Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, said in May the program would be replaced by a new remote jobs program in 2023 following a re-design. The Shire of Ngaanyatjarraku is among the sites hosting a trial of the new program, which is voluntary and will see people in work-like placements receive supplementary payments of up to $190.

12/23/2021,"Covid-19 testing clinics are reducing their openings hours over the Christmas period despite “unprecedented demand” for testing and reports of hours-long wait times in several states. Guardian Australia analysis shows 77% of the 490 testing sites listed on the New South Wales Health website on Wednesday will either close or operate on reduced hours through the Christmas and New Year period.  It comes amid record Covid cases in NSW and the highest testing numbers in Victoria since the beginning of the pandemic. Victoria reported 92,262 Covid test results on Wednesday, the most ever processed in a 24-hour window. In Melbourne, overwhelming demand for testing forced at least 14 testing sites across the city to shut as of 9.45am, after reaching capacity. They span from the east at Golfers Drive in Chadstone, south-east at Peninsula Health in Frankston and north at Heidelberg Repatriation hospital. Victoria’s acting premier, James Merlino, who has attributed the surging demand in Victoria to people needing a test to travel interstate for Christmas, urged people to be patient and said for most sites the wait was 40 minutes on average. Some walk-in clinics, such as St Vincent’s Hospital Melbourne, have listed wait times of three hours. Prime minister Scott Morrison said on Wednesday travel testing restrictions were placing the heath system under greater pressure. “We’ve all seen the terrible queues and the long waits people have had,” Morrison said. “Some 20 to 25 percent - one in five, one in four - people waiting in those queues are not symptomatic. “They’re not a close contact, they’re not even a casual contact, they just want to travel to another state. “This is putting unnecessary pressure on the testing system and it is redirecting resources away from where there is a better use of in particular in re-establishing the vaccine hubs run by the states and territories.” Morrison said PCR tests should be used for close contacts and the symptomatic, rather than people wanting to “get on a plane”. Victorian Covid-19 commander, Jeroen Weimar, made similar comments on Wednesday, saying travel testing requirements were a “bureaucratic reason” for delays. “It is not a highly productive way to use a PCR testing system,” he said. Queensland, Tasmania, South Australia and the Northern Territory all require fully vaccinated people from several states to provide a negative test result to enter. NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, said “tourism testing” was putting clinics under extreme pressure and has asked other states to reconsider their testing requirements. But at a press conference, the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said interstate travel only accounted for 10% of the tests being undertaken in NSW. “Ten percent of the lineups are for people who want to get their PCR tests to travel all around Australia, not just Queensland – 90% of people are concerned they have the Omicron variant and want to get tested,” she said. NSW reported a record 3,763 new Covid cases in the 24 hours to 8pm on Tuesday from 151,443 tests. Daily testing figures last exceeded 150,000 in the state during the Delta wave of infections in mid-September. Due to “unprecedented demand”, St Vincent’s hospital Sydney announced it was reducing opening hours at three testing sites from Wednesday. “This will help us to maintain our capacity capability,” it said in a tweet. Of 490 testing sites listed on the NSW Health website, 378 clinics will either close or operate on reduced hours during the end-of-year period. Testing lines this morning are pretty wild. This is North Ryde, where cars are backed up onto the M2. Everyone I spoke to is trying to get tests for travel, most aren’t hopeful they will have them in time.

12/23/2021,"It was a moment I had observed a thousand times before. The moment of unrelenting pressure – the 85th minute of a football match with the scores level, the final kilometre of a gruelling road cycling stage, the last lap of a tight 400m swimming race. As a sports writer, it is my great privilege is to watch the world’s top athletes in the cauldron of intensity that is elite sport. These are moments of truth. Suddenly it was my turn. On a sunny Sunday last month, I was in the waves at Malua Bay, New South Wales. Over the top of my wetsuit was a bright yellow rash-vest, distinguishing me from other competitors. Yellow, green, red, blue – blobs of colour for a beachside panel of judges to score as we battled it out in the two-metre chop.  Ever since I was a child, growing up on Canberra’s outskirts, I have been entranced by the south coast’s waves. Quarterly beach holidays saw me in the water, inevitably falling off a surfboard. But the calm lakes of the national capital are not a natural breeding ground for professional surfers. Stints in Washington DC and London, neither ocean-adjacent, did little to improve my prowess on the board. That changed in March last year, when the pandemic saw me flee for my homeland. Two weeks in self-isolation at a family beach house turned into 18 months of morning surfs, and, eventually, the start of my competitive surfing career. Having reported on the Malua Boardriders, a surf club reborn to help the local community heal from the black summer bushfires, I was gently encouraged to enter the monthly surf-off. By May I had plucked up the courage, only for my confidence to be shattered on debut by a lacklustre score of 3.14 (surfers are rated out for 10 for each wave). In the pressure of the moment, I had exhausted myself paddling for every possible wave – and failed to do anything notable on those I caught. As I trudged up the beach dejected, an onlooker offered some advice: “Only two waves count.” My wounded pride, the pandemic and a trip to cover the Olympics delayed my return to competition. But in November, inspired by Australia’s heroics at the Tokyo Games (including Owen Wright’s surfing bronze medal), I was back and determined to show some improvement. The conditions were tricky – large, shifting peaks and a powerful cross-beach rip. I managed to take off on a couple, but found myself caught in close-outs. Without the benefit of a high-tech communication system, the Boardriders were deploying coloured flags in the sand to mark the progress of time. When the green flag was replaced by yellow, I knew I had five minutes left – and nothing much on the scoreboard. This was it: my moment of consequence. After a decade of judging athletes in these moments, alternatively praising and criticising from the safety of the press box, it was my turn. I might not have had to face a media inquisition afterwards, and the hopes of a nation were most definitely not on my wetsuit-clad shoulders, but as the clock ticked down the pressure felt real enough. A peak formed in the distance, heading straight for me. I launched myself into it, taking off on my final wave of the heat. Either way it would be decisive – a fall would end my hopes of improvement and consign me to another walk of shame. As I came down the wave’s steep face and angled to the right, I realised that a small barrel was forming – the holy grail of surfing. I lurched inwards, pushing my head, then my body and eventually my board into the wave itself. It would have been ugly to watch from the beach, crude and inelegant. But it worked. At least momentarily, I was in the heart of the wave. Minutes later I walked up the beach, head held a little higher than last time. It was not until I reached the car park, and checked the live scoring app, that I was greeted with the good news. My final effort had been awarded 4.97 – the best wave of the heat. My combined score of 8.14 was enough to secure a spot in the semi-final. My run faltered later in the day, finishing last with a measly score. But I was elated all the same. Trying and largely failing at something new offers a potent dose of humility. And in those final minutes of the heat, as I waited for nature to test my limited surfing ability, I felt deeper empathy for those I analyse at Olympics, World Cups and world championships. It was a rush to be in that moment, needing to perform under acute time pressure. But most of all I felt proud that I had willingly put myself in that environment, where failure was all-but assured and any success guaranteed to be fleeting at best. It recalled something an Olympian had once said to me, about being unable to control the performances of competitors and the need, therefore, to take heart from personal effort – win, lose or draw. At the time I thought it was a mundane observation – now I appreciate its profoundness. Whether on the world stage or in the waves of Malua Bay, all any athlete can do is try. In the moments that matter, it is the trying, rather than the winning, that count. My 4.97 wave was just the cherry on top.",Sport/Sport,When a sportswriter tries competitive sport: a rush even if failure is all-but assured | Kieran Pender,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/23/when-a-sportswriter-tries-competitive-sport-a-rush-even-if-failure-is-all-but-assured
12/23/2021,"I sent a mass invitation for our family Christmas party for Christmas Day. The next day my aunt invited everyone over to her house for our family Christmas party, the day after Christmas. I cannot find one person outside my family that thinks that wasn’t completely rude. I see this as toxic behaviour on her part and support of bad behaviour from the rest of the crew. I took a week to get some perspective and see if others thought I was being oversensitive. Am I off-base or is this just not acceptable behaviour from my family? I feel as though we have all lived with this bad behaviour for so long we can’t even identify it any more.  Eleanor says: I can’t definitively answer whether this aunt’s behaviour was unacceptable. On one natural interpretation, if it’s “the” Christmas party, then yes – she’s plainly insulted your hospitality and competence. On the other, if it’s “a” Christmas party, she may just be continuing the celebration; lots of people have a second gathering on Boxing Day if there are two sides of the family, or too many leftovers, or just more fun to be had. So I can’t rule for you on your questions about being “toxic”; “just not acceptable”; or “bad behaviour”. But I can ask why branding her behaviour with those terms feels important to you. Sometimes we want to hear that behaviour is Objectively Bad, because we want the associated ruling that our feelings are Objectively Valid. The challenge with this – especially in decades-long relationships like the ones we have with family – is that the scale and complexity of our feelings doesn’t always match the mendacity of the actions that caused them. Instead, our feelings match the whole history that led up to this one moment – and that’s a lot harder to talk about and resolve. If you feel insulted by what this aunt did, I’ll bet it’s not just because of the particulars of this invite. I’ll bet there’s a long backdrop of past behaviour and infinitesimally small gestures and inflections between you that serve as a kind of meaning decoder. For you, this action it isn’t just this action, it’s a symbol; an instance of a pattern. It’s just one small visible protrusion of a whole subterranean network of roots. But if that subterranean network isn’t common knowledge – if she doesn’t see it, and the rest of the family doesn’t either – then this particular incident just won’t look the same to them. You’ll see the whole – every other time you’ve been disregarded or minimised or just not thought of; and they’ll see the part – a minor logistical question. I think this is why family arguments escalate so quickly; we often talk past each other about whether we’re objecting to the particulars of an incident, or what it’s an instance of. When there’s that kind of perceptual mismatch going on, it’s hard to get other people to agree that what so-and-so did was as Objectively Wrong as it has made us feel. That doesn’t mean we have to forfeit the judgment that our feelings are Objectively Valid. It just means we have to source it elsewhere. We have to recognise that we feel the way we do because of the trend, not because of this one instance. Once we do that, it feels a lot less important to win the dispute over this or that moment. We know the trend; we were there; whatever our relatives think of what’s happening now. In time, if you choose to challenge this aunt directly, it will be clear what the terms of the dispute are. In the meantime, throw a better party, and toast to your ability to validate your feelings on your own. Do you have a conflict, crossroads or dilemma you need help with?

12/23/2021,"On the main street of Newcastle, the Happy Wombat pub has become an oasis in the desert. “I feel like I’m running the last waterhole, and everyone’s coming here to drink the muddy water,” publican Luke Tilse tells Guardian Australia.  “Not that I’m saying my customers are animals.” Located on Hunter Street, the city’s main drag, it’s one of the only hotels that has not closed its doors during what was, pre-pandemic, the busiest trading week of the year. “It’s like the apocalypse out there,” Tilse says. “Everyone is staying away, either out of fear of getting Covid or having to isolate over Christmas, or because they have it. It’s a ghost town.” Newcastle, the second-largest city in New South Wales, is the centre of the largest Covid-19 outbreak in Australia. On Wednesday local health authorities said there were 5,728 total active cases in the Hunter region, of which Newcastle is the capital. The vast majority have come in the past seven days, a surge prompted by an outbreak of the Omicron variant at a popular nightclub, Argyle House, known locally as Fanny’s. The 1970s-themed prom night event at the club led to more than 200 people catching the virus, a super-spreader event local health official Dr David Durrheim said may be one of the largest recorded during the pandemic. That outbreak led to a series of similar clusters at nightclubs throughout the city. By 16 December the NSW health department issued advice urging the city’s residents to “seriously consider deferring any social events in Newcastle until after Christmas in order to help keep family Christmas gatherings safe, and to help protect their loved ones, the vulnerable and our essential workers”. The outbreak has left the city reeling. Events such as the Lunar Electric music festival were cancelled following an order by the NSW health minister, while on Wednesday the local A-League franchise, the Newcastle Jets, announced their Boxing Day match would be played behind closed doors, the first major sporting event to do so since the Omicron outbreak. Because the largest exposure sites have been nightclubs, many of those infected in Newcastle are younger, leading to crippling staff shortages which have forced many of the city’s hotels and restaurants to close. Tilse says that three of his staff members were at the Argyle House event, and later tested positive. That led to other employees having to isolate until they recorded negative tests. At the two pubs he owns, he expected to do more than $160,000 in trade over the week leading up to Christmas. Instead he has earned a little over $30,000. “And I’m one of the lucky ones because I can still be open on a skeleton staff,” he said. “But if you’ve got no customers and no staff why would you stay open?” The situation has prompted the city’s lord mayor, Nuatali Nelmes, to write to the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, to call for the jobsaver payment for small businesses to be reinstated, and to extend the pandemic leave disaster payment to workers whose business have closed due to staff shortages. “The flow-on effects from the sharp rise in case numbers and household contacts has been widespread devastation for local businesses, particularly for tourism, hospitality and retail businesses,” she wrote. “Thousands of businesses are facing severe staff shortages, meaning that many have made the difficult decision to cease trading until the New Year. This is in stark contrast to expectations, even a week ago, of the best trading week of the year.” At the same time, surging demand for booster vaccinations has prompted pharmacists to beg the federal government for increased supplies, citing a substantial shortfall of jabs. Anthony Piggott, who owns a chain of pharmacies in the Hunter, said he ordered extra doses immediately after the federal government announced it had shortened the eligibility time period for booster shots to five months on 12 December. They still haven’t arrived. “We’re now expecting to get them on Christmas Eve,” he said. “We’re getting literally hundreds of calls a day about this, and I can only vaccinate a fraction of them. “The demand has gone up by at least 10 times since then. We’re completely over-subscribed.” Luke Kelly, the president of the Newcastle and Hunter Valley Pharmacists Association, says chemists across the region are experiencing the same thing. “Delivery and the 14-day wait between placing an order and having it delivered is just crazy,” he said. “It’s putting everyone under a lot of pressure. People are trying to do the right thing to get their boosters and we have to send them away. There’s one single state-run hub in Belmont [a suburb about half-an-hour’s drive from the centre of Newcastle] and we don’t have the world’s greatest public transport. “It’s extraordinary. A combination of the outbreak and the change in the eligibility for boosters has just dramatically increased the demand.” So far the federal government has not moved to increase supply to the region. When the local Labor MP, Sharon Claydon, wrote to the federal health minister, Greg Hunt, about the “unacceptable shortage” of boosters in Newcastle, she was told there was no issue. “Supply is not an issue and there are sufficient doses to ensure everyone in Australia who is eligible for a booster dose can receive it over the festive period,” Hunt’s chief of staff wrote in a response seen by the Guardian.",News/Australia news,‘It’s a ghost town’: Covid has left NSW’s second-largest city reeling,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/23/its-a-ghost-town-covid-has-left-nsws-second-largest-city-reeling
12/23/2021,"With the advent of Omicron, we have a little more national accord in aspects of our public health strategy; we need to slow Omicron down as it moves through the population, and we should aim to do so while avoiding lockdown. The national vaccine program – especially boosters – is central to containing Omicron, and will be boosted itself with better funding incentives from the commonwealth to GPs, and pharmacies and the states ramping up hubs once again. But the other two areas of control focus may continue to be inconsistent across jurisdictions – partly due to different infection pressures, but also down to differences in risk tolerance that Omicron has not nudged aside.  The package of proven strategies that help contain spread, whether the virus is already circulating in the community or to reduce impact if it is reintroduced, are one and the same; masks, physical distancing, hygiene and managing gatherings safely. These were recognised today as a critical pillar in disease control, but the management of these resides with our states and territories, and there wasn’t agreement on how these should be implemented. What is critical is how well the advice is adhered to, and whether measures already in place need to be tightened. National consistency would be helpful to convey a clear message on the importance of these measures. If there is high compliance in New South Wales already with reportedly 85% mask wearing in retail settings, then introducing a mask rule is not really an impost. Conversely, if rules in other jurisdictions are not achieving high compliance, then that needs to be looked at too. We are moving to greater consistency in case and contact follow-up, but priorities change as resources are spread more thinly when case infection rates grow, and states with low case numbers want to continue more aggressive case follow-up while they can. QR codes still have a role, whether as an outbreak investigation tool in low infection settings or allowing automatic notification of contact with an exposure site or as a memory prompt of your movements in high transmission areas. Small steps on Wednesday, but at least this may be a platform for greater national consistency as the coronavirus progressively moves through our community and both our goals and our case load become more uniform.  Catherine Bennett is chair in epidemiology at Deakin University It seems it is still not a race. There is a clear need to mandate minimally intrusive but highly protective measures such as masks and QR codes anywhere that Omicron is spreading in the community. The lack of action after the national cabinet meeting held on Wednesday is difficult to understand. We need leadership in making mask-wearing indoors mandatory – leaving this to “personal responsibility” is frankly irresponsible. Wearing a mask to prevent Covid is not analogous to putting on sunscreen to prevent skin cancer. No amount of sunscreen I slap on will protect you from skin cancer. In contrast, Covid is an airborne transmissible virus so if you wear a mask it protects me and vice versa. And all of us wearing masks consistently will protect the health system. We need to ensure high testing and tracing capacity – for the latter, QR codes are the only way to keep up when case numbers are high. We have invested in the infrastructure for digital tracing so it makes no sense to throw it all away. The 3,763 cases in New South Wales on Wednesday will have up to 80,000 contacts, and the contacts are the most likely to become the next cases. If we don’t alert the contacts, the epidemic will explode, health systems will collapse and we may be forced into the lockdown that we never wanted after all. Magical thinking will not stop this – only a smart, layered strategy will do that. For NSW to abandon everything as cases surge during the time of maximal gatherings, will result in avoidable illness and death. But it seems that any national strategy for TTQI can wait another two weeks for the next cabinet meeting. We learned on Wednesday there are 20m doses of mRNA vaccine in Australia. It is fantastic that we have the supply but vaccine in the fridge won’t help manage the Omicron surge. Maintaining the delivery of boosters over the Christmas holidays will save lives but that won’t happen without a plan. Other countries have called in the army. We are giving a $10 a dose incentive. With surging cases, NSW Health is already preparing us to turn our homes into hospitals – they advise if you are under 50, manage your Covid at home, and call your GP if you need help. Most GP practices are operating on skeleton staff over the holidays, so good luck with that. There will be preventable deaths of people at home who were unable to access care. We all need to take responsibility for avoiding the worst-case scenario of the Omicron wave. Our leaders are relying on Australians to act responsibility. Australians are relying on our leaders to act responsibly as well.  Nancy Baxter is head of the school of population and global health at the University of Melbourne.

12/23/2021,"During 2020’s first lockdown, Guardian Australia launched The funniest things on the internet, a weekly column to bring joy to readers who very much needed it. For each column, a famously funny person picks out the links, videos and tweets that have made them laugh the hardest. We thought it would be short-lived, but as the pandemic kept going, so too did our need for levity – and now the Thursday spot has become a mainstay.  And we’d like our readers to take part as well. Please join us in the comments with a link to the funniest thing you’ve seen online in the past year: it can be a tweet, an Instagram, a TikTok, a video, a headline, an article ... anything that isn’t offensive, defamatory or mean-spirited, really. To get you started, Guardian staff have picked theirs.

12/23/2021,"Australia’s peak doctors body has criticised an “unethical” proposal to charge unvaccinated people for their medical care that is being considered by the New South Wales government. The state’s health minister, Brad Hazzard, confirmed the government was looking at forcing people who had not received the jab to pay for their medical bills if they required hospital treatment for Covid.  “This is an option under consideration by the NSW Government,” Hazzard said in a statement on Wednesday evening after it was first reported by Sydney radio station 2GB. The health minister did not provide any further details about how such a plan would work and did not respond to further questions. The idea represents a radical departure from Australia’s system of universal healthcare and has attracted fierce criticism. Australian Medical Association president Omar Korshid, labelled the proposal “unethical”. “The big issue from a medical point of view is that it’s really not ethical or the right thing to do to limit access to healthcare based on people’s previous health choices,” he told Guardian Australia. “If you follow that same logic, are you going to ask smokers to pay for their healthcare? “I think it would be a real shame if through this pandemic we lose our compassion, we lose our humanity, and our care for fellow Australians, even if they’ve made choices we think are unwise or incorrect or even completely antisocial.” Korshid said he was unsure whether such a proposal would be legal or if it would violate the National Health Reform Agreement, struck between the states and the commonwealth, through which public hospital funding flows. “Any change to that would be a very substantial change to our public hospitals,” he said. He also questioned how it could be enforced given the cost of an ICU admission for Covid-19 was “astronomical” and there was “no way” the average Australian would have any way of paying the bill. In NSW, 93.4% of residents aged 16 and over are fully vaccinated, but the majority of people in intensive care are unvaccinated. The number of Covid patients in hospital in NSW has nearly doubled over the past week. On Wednesday, there were 302 people in hospital with the virus, including 40 in the ICU, and 12 who required ventilation. In November, former NSW premier Bob Carr called for Australia to follow Singapore’s example after its government announced it would start charging people who were “unvaccinated by choice” for their medical bills. Follow Singapore and legislate no medical or hospital expenses to be reimbursed to people who are not vaccinated without medical justification and then contract Covid. You ignored warnings and got the disease. You pay for your wilful stupidity, not the rest of us. At the time, Scott Morrison said it was a “heavy-handed approach” that he did not support. “We don’t have a mandatory vaccination policy as a federal government, that’s not something that we’ve done,” he told 7News’ Sunrise. “We live in a country where we’re not going around demonising those who want to make their own choices, I think that’s very important.”",News/Australia news,‘Unethical’: doctors condemn NSW government for considering charging unvaccinated patients for Covid care,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/23/unethical-doctors-condemn-nsw-government-for-considering-charging-unvaccinated-patients-for-covid-care
