3/1/2022,"Fiona Hill said Trump missed a warning that the nuclear option could be on the table in a conflict. Hill told Politico that Putin made the warning in one of his final meetings with Trump. ""I don't think Trump figured out what he was saying,"" Hill, an expert on Russia, said. Russian President Vladimir Putin warned former President Donald Trump that if it came down to it, he would use the nuclear option, but Trump missed the warning, Fiona Hill said. Hill, the former Senior Director for Europe and Russia at the United States National Security Council, told Politico's Maura Reynolds that the road ahead in Russia's invasion of Ukraine is dangerous. On Sunday, Putin ordered Russia's nuclear deterrent forces to be put on high alert, meaning the weapons have been ordered to be prepared for an increased possibility of launch, Insider's Connor Perrett reported. Hill told Reynolds that the decision was Putin ""making it very clear that nuclear is on the table."" Additionally, Hill said in one of the final meetings between Trump and Putin – where she was present – Putin tried to warn Trump about this very possibility but she didn't ""think Trump figured out what he was saying."" She said: ""Putin was making the point that: 'Well you know, Donald, we have these hypersonic missiles.' And Trump was saying, 'Well, we will get them too.' Putin was saying, 'Well, yes, you will get them eventually, but we've got them first.'"" Hill said there was ""a menace in the exchange"" and Putin was ""putting us on notice that if push came to shove in some confrontational environment that the nuclear option would be on the table."" She told Reynolds that for Putin, having an ""instrument"" means he wants to use it. ""Why have it if you can't? He's already used a nuclear weapon in some respects,"" Hill said, referencing Russian operatives' use of radioactive polonium against Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 and the weapons-grade nerve agent, Novichok, against Sergei Skripal and Alexander Navalny. ""So if anybody thinks that Putin wouldn't use something that he's got that is unusual and cruel, think again. Every time you think, 'No, he wouldn't, would he?' Well, yes, he would. And he wants us to know that, of course,"" Hill said.

3/1/2022,"STORY: In his interview with Reuters on Monday, John Spencer, the Chair of Urban Warfare Studies with the Modern War Institute at West Point, said Russian President Vladimir Putin underestimated the resistance his troops would face in Ukraine. Spencer painted an even more difficult scenario if and when Russians were to attempt to take the capital city of Kyiv. ""If we get to that phase I think it'll immediately transition to an [Ukrainian] insurgency,"" Spencer said. ""I think the world will continue to support that insurgency,"" he said. Russia faces economic turmoil as Western nations, united in condemnation of its assault, hit it with sanctions that rippled around the world and whose targets include President Vladimir Putin and his confidants. The European Union placed new sanctions on Russian oligarchs and officials and some of its members urged the bloc to begin talks on Ukrainian accession. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy signed a letter formally requesting EU membership, an emphatic statement of commitment to Western values. But Putin showed no sign of reconsidering the invasion he unleashed on Russia's neighbor last Thursday in an attempt to pull it firmly back under Moscow's influence and redraw Europe's security map.",Politics/Reuters Videos,U.S. expert cites 'weird military blunders' in Russian invasion,https://news.yahoo.com/u-expert-cites-weird-military-025003952.html
3/1/2022,"(Reuters) - Canada ordered two Russian flights out of its airspace on Monday after the aircraft, which identified themselves as ""humanitarian"" flights, violated a ban on Russian aircraft, air-traffic control service said. Canada banned Russian planes from entering its airspace starting on Sunday as part of severe sanctions imposed on Moscow in response to its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. But the same day, an Aeroflot flight AFL111 violated the ban after declaring itself as a humanitarian flight. Under normal circumstances, Canada's air-traffic control service NAV CANADA does not have the authority to deny airspace access to an aircraft declaring itself a humanitarian flight. The other Russian plane that attempted to enter Canadian airspace had departed from U.S. airports. NAV CANADA along with regulator Transport Canada has issued a directive to all air traffic control units to deny all identifiable Russian airplanes access to their airspace. The only exception to this ban is a prior approval by Transport Canada. Incase of another violation, NAV CANADA will direct the offending airplane to the closest airport and notify the regulator, to be immediately reported to Canada's Air Defense Sector and the regulator.
