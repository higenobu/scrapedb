4/10/2022,"When the news broke last week that Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX and the world’s richest man, had paid $2.9bn (£2.3bn) for 9.2% of Twitter, the media world – old and new – briefly lost what might loosely be called its collective mind. What was Musk up to? (He’s always up to something, after all, even if it’s just trolling. And, with more than 80 million Twitter followers, he’s quite an effective troll.) Since nobody knows what goes on inside Musk’s head, fevered speculation began. One camp thought that he had just done it “for the lulz” (fun, amusement, humour, schadenfreude). Indeed, if your net worth is $290bn, $2.9bn is effectively loose change. And it made him the biggest single shareholder in the company. Twitter then recognised the gravity of the situation and agreed to give him a seat on the board in a deal that supposedly prevents him from buying a majority stake in the business. For what it’s worth, I don’t buy the lulz explanation. Of course Musk loves playing to his vast gallery, but something far more serious is afoot. He wants to make significant changes to the way Twitter works. In particular, he believes the platform ought to have an edit button that would enable people to revise their tweets post-transmission. He polled his Twitter followers asking if they agreed. Of the 4.4 million who voted, 73.6% said yes. Why is this interesting? Basically because Musk has a problem with his own addiction to Twitter. It’s called the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the powerful agency of the federal government that was created in the aftermath of the 1929 Wall Street Crash and whose primary purpose is to enforce the law against market manipulation. And Musk has been in conflict with the SEC for quite a while. In 2018, for example, he was sued by the agency after he had tweeted that he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private at $420 a share. He settled the case by giving up his title as chairman and the company agreed to appoint a “Twitter sitter” – a securities lawyer who would henceforth have to approve any written statement Musk made about the company that might contain “material information”. The settlement was updated in 2019 to specify topics he couldn’t tweet about without approval; these included Tesla’s financial condition, earnings forecast, proposed acquisitions and production data. Trying to put a legal muzzle on Musk is like trying to put a lid on Mount Etna and the SEC is investigating whether he has been complying with the 2019 settlement. Having seen some of the stuff he’s tweeted, I’d be amazed if the agency found that he had been in compliance with either the letter or the spirit of the settlement. Last month, he filed a legal suit asking a federal judge to throw out the agreement. Most significantly, his lawyer contended that the SEC is effectively trying to prevent him from exercising his “first amendment rights”. So apparently this is now all about the US government trying to curb the free speech rights of a chief executive to publish anything he likes, including market-sensitive comments about its stock price (as in a Musk tweet of 1 May 2020 that “Tesla stock is too high imo”). Given that Musk’s tweeting incontinence seems incurable, it’ll be interesting to see what the SEC decides. As a government agency, it clearly cannot force Twitter to deplatform him, because that would indeed infringe the first amendment. On the other hand, Twitter could ban him – as it did Donald Trump – because it’s just a public company. although it now happens to be part-owned by him. But what if Musk continues his practice of tweeting what in securities law is regarded as material information about his company – stuff that could affect its share price? This would put him on a collision course with the law that would deter most corporate executives. Musk, however, has a track record of being indifferent to legal regulations. At the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis, he reopened his California Tesla factory in defiance of a local lockdown order. As the Guardian reported at the time: “‘Tesla is restarting production today against Alameda County rules,’” the billionaire chief executive tweeted. ‘I will be on the line with everyone else. If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me.’” He also threatened to move its headquarters and “future programmes” to Texas or Nevada “immediately” and suggested that the company may not continue to “retain Fremont manufacturing at all”. We’ve arrived at a strange place where, as tech commentator Ranjan Roy puts it: “The US government regulator has been in a fight with the world’s richest man over his ability to use a communications platform that’s vital to his business interests – and he just went and effectively bought the platform.” Which may be why he is suddenly in favour of being able to revise his tweets. It may ultimately be his get-out-of-jail card. The reshape of things to comeThe Geopolitics of Fossil Fuels and Renewables Reshape the World is a marvellous reality check by Helen Thompson in Nature.

4/10/2022,"It was a big year for Tan Dun, the Oscar-winning Chinese musician who would go on to compose the soundtrack for the film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. In the autumn of 1973, Tan, then a teenager, was sent to a rural commune in Hunan province to plant rice. China was at the height of the Cultural Revolution. One day, Tan heard a sound from a loudspeaker in the field. “Do you want to hear some interesting music? This is called ‘symphony’. The Philadelphia Orchestra is in China,” a friend said to Tan. It was the first time he had heard about a “symphony orchestra”, and it was striking. “I think it was something by Beethoven – the Sixth or the Fifth symphony.” Until then, Tan had never known of Beethoven or Mozart, but he was deeply touched by the performance blasted from the loudspeaker. When he returned home, he told his grandmother that he would like to learn more about it. “Somehow, the seed of my future was planted,” he said. The story of the Philadelphia’s China adventure is not as well known as the “ping pong diplomacy” between the US and China that had taken place two years earlier. But its two-week tour of China in 1973 marked the beginning of five decades of people-to-people exchanges between the two nations, something that is now under threat with the rise of geopolitical tensions. This is the subject of a 90-minute documentary, Beethoven in Beijing, directed by a former veteran Philadelphia Inquirer journalist, Jennifer Lin. The book about the trip – under the same title – is published later this month. “This is an important chapter in the history of US-China relations,” Lin told the Observer. “For the Chinese and Americans, it’s a reminder that even though you don’t speak the same language, music still creates connections.” A year after Richard Nixon’s historic trip in February 1972 to China, Henry Kissinger learned from Chinese leaders that they would like to invite the Philadelphia Orchestra to China. Nixon rang its music director, the Hungarian-American conductor Eugene Ormandy, who immediately sensed history in the making: “That’s wonderful. You honour me, honour the orchestra,” he responded. The first western symphony orchestra that performed in China was the London Philharmonic Orchestra. But that year, Premier Zhou Enlai was thinking of ways to change the Chinese narrative on the US, which for more than two decades had been denounced as “blood-sucking capitalists”. Western high culture was reviled as “bourgeois”. Since the beginning of the Cultural Revolution in 1966, Mozart’s and Beethoven’s music had both been banned. US diplomat Nicholas Platt, now 86, was tasked by Nixon to negotiate with the Chinese what should be played and whom the group should meet while in China. He had been on the trip to China with the president and Kissinger in 1972. And in 1973 he was asked to open the first US liaison office in Beijing, which later became the American embassy. “At the Chinese foreign ministry, we haggled endlessly over the details of the visit, negotiating music programmes as if they were treaties,” Platt said, recalling the months of negotiations with Beijing before the trip. “It was a very tricky business because the wife of Chairman Mao Zedong, Jiang Qing, had very firm ideas about what should be played and what should not. So did Ormandy.” Richard Strauss’s Don Juan was rejected straight away. Debussy’s Afternoon of a Faun was said to be “decadent” and “prurient”. But the Chinese liked Mozart and Schubert, as they viewed them as “politically neutral”. The back and forth continued until even after the orchestra landed in China in the autumn of 1973. The biggest change in the final play list, according to Platt, was performing Beethoven’s Sixth Symphony. The Chinese had long wanted to include it, but Ormandy was not keen. And, of course, in performing on Chinese soil in front of Madame Mao, the communally composed Yellow River Concerto had to be included, too. Cui Zhuping, at the time a young violinist in the Chinese Central Philharmonic, recalled the moment she heard the Philadelphia Orchestra on her home turf. “Their sound was particularly mellow and full. It had such a range I never heard before.” The Cultural Revolution ended in 1976 with Mao’s death. The next year, Cui’s Central Philharmonic marked the 150th anniversary of Beethoven’s death by performing his Fifth Symphony. The last two movements were aired across the country. Some have remarked that, for music lovers, this broadcast marked the real end of China’s decade of political turmoil. After that, the country embarked on a different path. “That trip opened up our relationship, the beginning of the culture exchange,” Platt said. “It also unleashed a whole host of other ties between the US and China, from trade to diplomacy. It was the beginning of everything.” The last trip the Philadelphia Orchestra made to China was in 2019, before the Covid outbreak. But throughout the pandemic, it has managed to continue its connection with the Chinese virtually. “Music connects us. That’s as true today as it was in 1973,” Lin said. “Although the political relationship between the United States and China is fraying, our musical ties are stronger than ever.” In 2004, Tan – now an accomplished composer – was invited to conduct in Philadelphia. He told the audience of the moment he heard the orchestra from a loudspeaker in rural China in 1973: “This is the first orchestra I heard, from a loudspeaker in the field. And this orchestra sound, this orchestra – actually, all of you – changed my life.”",News/World news,How Beethoven inspired 50 years of cultural exchange between the US and China,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/09/beethoven-in-beijing-concert-50-years-us-china-cultural-exchange
4/10/2022,"Light of tone and phenomenally agile, the sound of Mark Turner’s tenor saxophone is so beguiling that I’d happily listen to him playing from a book of exercises. His own music, though, is quite demanding. That means you have to pay attention and occasionally lose the plot, which is no bad thing. It sounds even better the second time around. His quartet is completed by trumpet (Jason Palmer), bass (Joe Martin) and drums (Jonathan Pinson). The absence of a piano or any other harmony instrument leaves a lot of open space, which they exploit with subtlety and imagination. All eight pieces are composed by Turner; he determined the general atmosphere of each, writing part of the music in advance. Beyond that it’s a mutual process. The interplay between Turner and Palmer is quite superb, two melodic lines moving between harmony and dissonance, yet always in touch, always on the same journey. And, with ECM’s fabled clarity, you can follow it all closely. The album was inspired by a sci-fi novel of the same name by Stanisław Lem.

4/10/2022,"Boris Johnson is meeting the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy during an unannounced visit to Kyiv, Ukrainian officials have said. A picture posted on Twitter by the embassy of Ukraine to the UK showed the two leaders sitting across a table in the capital, with their respective flags in the background. The embassy tweeted the photo along with the caption: “Surprise”. Surprise 😉 pic.twitter.com/AWa5RjYosD A No 10 spokesperson said the prime minister was using the unannounced visit to set out a new package of financial and military aid. “The prime minister has travelled to Ukraine to meet President Zelenskiy in person, in a show of solidarity with the Ukrainian people,” the spokesperson said. “They will discuss the UK’s long-term support to Ukraine and the PM will set out a new package of financial and military aid.” Johnson’s visit comes the day after he announced a further £100m worth of UK military assistance for Ukrainian forces, including anti-tank and anti-aircraft weaponry and so-called “suicide drones”, which loiter over the battlefield before attacking their target. Johnson’s trip to Kyiv may be seen as a publicity coup for the prime minister who has been desperate to travel to Ukraine. The security situation in the capital has stabilised after Russian forces withdrew from their forward positions on 29 March. They abandoned the towns of Bucha and Hostomel north-west of Kyiv and retreated to Belarus. Since then artillery attacks on the city have stopped. Emergency teams have swept highways and roadsides for explosives and have been towing away destroyed Russian armoured vehicles. With air travel impossible, Johnson will have driven to Kyiv, most probably from eastern Poland. The 600km route from the border passes the western city of Lviv. On the outskirts of the capital Johnson will have seen blown-up Russian tanks by the side of the road, as well as ironic welcoming signs painted by Ukrainians saying: “Russia go fuck yourself”. Johnson is a popular figure in Kyiv after having delivered vital anti-tank weapons, the Swedish-made NLAW system, to the Ukrainian army. Zelenskiy has repeatedly praised the UK’s staunch support. A growing number of senior politicians are now making the trip. On Friday the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, visited together with her deputy, Josep Borrell. Both condemned the Russian rocket attack on a train station in the eastern city of Kramatorsk. Johnson travelled to Kyiv before to the invasion on 1 February and held talks with Zelenskiy in the Mariinsky palace, the president’s official residence. He said then the UK would impose sanctions on Russia as soon as the “first Russian toecap” strode into Ukrainian territory. He also warned – correctly – that Russia’s armed forces were a “clear and present danger”. It was reported last month that Johnson wanted to go to Kyiv, but that UK security officials were nervous about the prospect. At the time, the Tory co-chair Oliver Dowden claimed the prime minister was “desperate to go to Ukraine” and had a “real emotional connection” with the Ukrainian people. Downing Street sources indicated at the time that a visit was unlikely to happen. The visit comes after Zelenskiy called on Ukraine’s allies to provide the country with more military aid and step up sanctions on Russia, after the missile attack in Kramatorsk that killed at least 50 people, including five children. Russia’s defence ministry denied responsibility. Johnson’s visit came as the European Commission said it would pledge €1bn (£834m) to support Ukraine and countries receiving refugees fleeing the war, Von der Leyen, said on Saturday. “Six-hundred million of those will go to Ukraine, to the Ukrainian authorities and partially to the United Nations,” Von der Leyen said at a fundraising event for Ukraine in Warsaw. “And €400m will go to the frontline states that are doing such an outstanding job and helping the refugees that are coming.”",News/Politics,Boris Johnson meets Volodymyr Zelenskiy in unannounced visit to Kyiv,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/09/boris-johnson-meets-volodymyr-zelenskiy-in-unannounced-visit-to-kyiv
4/10/2022,"Bristol will be happy. No one else will. Neutrals, alas, will be the most upset of all by this, traumatised even. There was a good try, scored by Semi Radradra, whose introduction on the hour was less a tactical masterstroke, more a humanitarian gesture to those watching, so dreadful had the action been up till then. But when the final whistle sounded the crowd awoke to the news that Bristol had snuck a first win here since 2017. Radradra’s try means they will take a one-point lead back to Ashton Gate on Friday for the second leg. Rarely had a full-time whistle been yearned for more keenly, but it actually meant only half-time in the tie. That was perhaps the most depressing thing of all. The two-legged nature of the affair had prompted Pat Lam to leave Charles Piutau and Radradra on the bench and, boy, was the game poorer for it. Rarely has a match required the concept of the “finisher” more. And the sooner the game could finish the better. The score on the hour was 6-3, which massively flattered those first 60 minutes. For a match report to be reduced to discussing individual penalties hopefully says more about the match than the writer. Even to indulge each scoring incident of the first 40 minutes with a description would be a flattery too far. Suffice it to say, two penalties by Rob du Preez opened up a 6-0 lead for the home side in the first 10 minutes, a break down the left by Arron Reed worthy of a mention at least in the buildup to the first. If only Sale could have involved Reed more. The youngster has real pace and, until Radradra’s intervention, provided the game’s only breaks from mediocrity. Otherwise, we are talking some infringements or other at the breakdown for the rest of the half’s points. As for any variety, we had to look to the skies, whence water cascaded for a little while, to make a change from rugby balls. Presumably unable to take much more of this, Lam introduced Piutau for the second half. Early indications were hopeful, when some footwork by the latter released Harry Randall on a run, but Kyle Sinckler, England international, flung another pass to the floor, before Dave Attwood, England international, did the same. End of passage. It would be no distortion whatsoever to offer that vignette as a summary of the first hour or so. Except for the good bit by Piutau that sparked it - that would be to offer a misleading impression of quality. Even Randall, not just an England international but the actual England scrum-half, took to sending passes to no one. So Lam introduced Radradra for the final quarter. At last we had something. It came from a mistake, obviously - Simon Hammersley spilling the latest high ball - but from the scrum Piers O’Conor sprung Radradra through Sale’s midfield. The finish by the Fijian was, unquestionably, of the highest quality. Thus Sale found themselves 10-6 down with 10 minutes to go. When they were offered the chance of a shot at goal with five minutes to go - some breakdown infringement or other - Du Preez chose to go for goal to pull them back to within a point. They certainly had not looked like scoring any other way. “Therein lies the beauty of the double-header,” said Alex Sanderson, Sale’s director of rugby. “Patience is a virtue; anger is a gift. Any frustration or anger that we have, we get to exercise it all. Roll on Friday night.”",Sport/Sport,Semi Radradra gives Bristol narrow Champions Cup advantage over Sale,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/09/sale-bristol-european-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report
