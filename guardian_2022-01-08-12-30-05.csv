1/8/2022,"Joe Biden ended his tour of neighborhoods devastated by Colorado’s most destructive blaze by emphasizing the link between America’s escalating wildfires and the global climate crisis, saying that the US can “no longer ignore the reality” of weather conditions that have “supercharged” blazes. Biden’s trip to Boulder county on Friday marked his sixth climate disaster tour since taking office a year ago, underscoring the growing threat of global heating in the US and the need for radical action to cut greenhouse gas emissions.  Last week’s prairie grass fire destroyed almost 1,100 homes and some businesses after hurricane-force winds drove flames through two densely populated Denver suburbs, forcing 35,000 people to flee. The cumulative effect of unusually wet conditions last spring followed by extremely dry and warm conditions through December – weather patterns linked to global heating – enabled the rare winter fire to scorch over 6,000 acres, engulfing residential neighborhoods and commercial districts alike. After meeting some of the affected families, Biden praised the courage of survivors and said: “We can’t ignore the reality that these fires are being supercharged. They’re being supercharged by changing weather.” Biden pledged not to abandon families as they try to rebuild, saying “we’re here with you and we’re not going away”. The Colorado disaster capped a catastrophic year for the US in which at least 650 people died from climate disasters including heatwaves, hurricanes, fires and floods. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the estimated economic cost of the destruction had topped $100bn even before the Colorado blaze. A 69-year-old construction worker, Robert Sharpe, has been confirmed dead, while another person remains unaccounted for. The cause of the fire remains under investigation. Biden’s latest disaster tour underlines the stakes of his teetering Build Back Better (BBB) legislation, which earmarks $550bn to tackle the largest sources of global heating gases – energy and transportation. The bill’s passage has been impeded by the fossil-fuel friendly senator Joe Manchin, who angered his Democratic colleagues by opposing the historic social spending package that includes major investments in forest restoration, wildfire resiliency, and mitigation as part of what would be the country’s largest ever climate crisis investment. Experts say that without the bill it will be impossible to meet the administration’s target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to at least 50% below 2005 levels by 2030. Globally, the US is the second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, after China, and scientists warn that even halving emissions by 2030 may not be enough to avoid a catastrophic rise in atmospheric and oceanic temperatures, which elevate the risk of wildfires, intensify drought and rainstorms, and exacerbate flooding. “In the last few months we’ve seen vivid examples of the extraordinary costs the country is shouldering because of climate change, and the problem is worsening day by day,” said Vijay Limaye, a climate and health scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) Science Center. “The tremendous benefits of the adaptation and mitigation measures in BBB would far outweigh the costs.” As the Biden administration battles to rescue the legislation and get it through the Senate, there are growing calls to accelerate reforms needed to modernize government agencies so that they are equipped for climate disasters and extreme weather events. Manchin’s vote is crucial as the bill is opposed by Republicans. On Friday, the Colorado Democratic congressman Joe Neguse, co-chair of the bipartisan Wildfire Caucus, unveiled a new bill to help prevent future wildfires, fund state-of-the-art firefighting equipment and programs, and support recovery efforts for communities and forests affected by fires across the west. “As we endure increasingly worse wildfire seasons, it is critical for the federal government to lend a hand in stopping fires before they start, fighting them if they spread, and helping our communities fully recover after they’ve been contained … We cannot expect our communities to bear the burden of these disasters on their own,” said Neguse. The Western Wildfire Support Act, co-sponsored by Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, would direct the departments of the interior and agriculture to create fire prevention, management and recovery plans for federal land across the western US. It would also provide $100m in funding to help communities impacted by wildfires conduct long-term rehabilitation projects. Neguse, whose district includes Boulder county, launched the Wildfire Caucus after the unprecedented 2020 season, when more than a thousand fires destroyed 665,454 acres of land in Colorado. Last year, more than 8,600 fires were recorded in California – a historic high that caused over 2.5m acres to burn. Exposure to wildfire smoke can cause serious health problems such as asthma attacks and pneumonia, can worsen chronic heart and lung diseases and can increase the risk of lower birth weights if pregnant women are exposed. Yet while damage to property is well tracked, there are no national statistics on hospital admissions or other health impacts of wildfires – or any climate disasters. “Climate-related health tracking is in very poor shape nationally. We barely have a handle on the physical health implications, never mind the impact on mental health,” said Limaye. Yet the scale of the health and social costs are likely to be substantial given that in 2021 alone, more than four in 10 Americans lived in a county struck by climate disaster, according to an analysis by the Washington Post. The Post’s analysis found that about 15% of Americans live in counties where fire disasters were declared in 2021, and the conditions necessary for fire – high temperatures, low rainfall, and high winds – last on average more than a month longer than they did four decades ago. If the planet continues to heat up, research suggests that by mid-century the fire season could lengthen by another 23 days. As BBB stalls and the drilling of fossil fuel continues apace, it’s a race against time to ensure government agencies, regulations and standards are fit for purpose as drought, flooding and other extreme weather events will almost certainly continue to escalate. Biden has reinstated some climate-smart standards rescinded by Trump, such as requiring all federally funded projects to take into account the long-term risk of flooding and sea level rise, but most building and land use standards remain woefully outdated, according to the NRDC analyst Rob Moore. Learning from past mistakes is also key. A group of lawmakers from states bearing the brunt of extreme weather events (Hawaii, Louisiana and California) support creating a National Disaster Safety Board (NDSB), modelled on the body that investigates aviation accidents, to help identify and correct the factors that contributed to a hazard, such as a storm or wildfire, becoming a full-blown climate disaster. Moore said: “The board would be a tremendous addition to coping with climate disasters nationally and accelerate climate adaptation efforts. Extreme weather events are no longer an act of God, they are systemic and endemic problems which we need to plan for.”",News/Environment,‘We can’t ignore reality’: Colorado fires highlight urgency of US climate legislation,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/07/climate-change-colorado-wildfires-joe-biden-build-back-better
1/8/2022,"Australia ended 2021 in an unusual climatic state, with no region in this famously wide, mostly brown land officially in drought for the first time since 2017. The Bureau of Meteorology’s latest drought report, released on Friday, said the country’s record rainfall in November helped clear up remaining areas of short- to medium-term rainfall deficiencies.  A slightly drier than average December – including the driest December in Tasmania since 1994 – did not derail the generally wetter trajectory of late for the country. “It’s the first time in five years, since the start of 2017, that we haven’t any part of Australia in what we call a meteorological drought,” said Simon Grainger, a senior climatologist with the Bureau of Meteorology. Such a measure assesses the extent and severity of drought conditions by comparing rain tallies to typical levels for a region, and is keenly watched by farmers and firefighters, among others. Climate change is altering the chances of rain, with southern Australia tending to dry out, particularly in winter, while northern Australia is getting wetter. Last year was marked by storms and floods and ended up as Australia’s coolest since 2012 but still unusually warm for a La Niña year. It was also the wettest year since 2016. Among the state capitals, Perth was a standout with rainfall 22% above 1990s averages. The 892mm recorded in the Western Australian capital made it the wettest year since 1994, Grainger said. WA was notable for its searing December heat, with the state posting its third-hottest December on record for maximum and mean temperatures, the bureau said. Marble Bar – the Pilbara town more akin to a frying pan – sweltered with 29 consecutive days of at least 42C, beating a previous record run of 25 such blistering days in 1986. Mardie, also in north-west WA, recorded Australia’s hottest temperature in 2021, with the mercury reaching a toasty 47.9C on 20 December. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The experience for most Australians, though, was a moderately cool year. “It’s been relatively cool across the south-eastern capitals, Melbourne, Adelaide, Canberra,” Grainger said. Melbourne’s days averaged 19.8C in 2021, the coolest since 1996. Nights in the Victorian capital averaged 11.2C, the coolest since 2006. The city’s rainfall of 682.6mm was 5% above the long-run average. Sydney, which is typically wetter than Melbourne, recorded 1,290.2mm rain in 2021 – 6% above the norm.

Minimums were 0.3% above the norm at 14.1C. Canberra’s 19.6C average maximum gave the national capital its coolest year since 1996, or 0.3C below the long-term norm. Minimums of 6.2C were the briskest since 2012, similarly 0.3C below average. Rainfall of 912.6mm was the most since 2010, or 46% above average. Adelaide was another capital on the cool side, with an average maximum of 22.0C – the coolest since 1997 - and 0.6C below the norm. Minimums were 10C cooler, averaging 12C, the chilliest year since 2002. Rain was close to average at 506.4mm. Brisbane, too, with average days reaching 26.4C, was 0.3C cooler than the 1990s, though nights were slightly above average at 16.6C. Annual rainfall was 39% above average, at 1,407mm, even if the city’s main Wivenhoe dam missed out on it, ending the year at under half full. Hobart maintained its record as Australia’s second driest capital, with its 664.2mm of rain about 9% higher than the long-run average. Maximums of 17.7C across the year were close the average since 1991, as were minimums of 9.2C. In the Top End, Darwin’s days averaged 33C in 2021, making it the city’s equal fourth hottest year on record. Minimums in Darwin averaged 23.9C, or 0.6C above the average over the past 30 years, making it the eighth-warmest for overnight temperatures. Rainfall was just above average at 1,787.8mm. Rounding out the extremes, Australia’s coldest place in 2021 was Perisher Valley in New South Wales, where the mercury sank to 10.0C below zero on 7 July. And in a year of big floods that looks likely to extend into 2022 along with the La Niña set-up in the Pacific, the wettest daily recording was Byfield in north Queensland. There the rain gauge collected 550mm on 17 March.",News/Australia news,Australia ends 2021 with no region officially in drought after a year of wet weather,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/08/australia-ends-2021-with-no-region-officially-in-drought-after-a-year-of-wet-weather
1/8/2022,"Parts of Queensland are experiencing major flooding, with the aftermath of ex-tropical Cyclone Seth causing “unexpected” prolonged heavy rain and storms. The Bureau of Meteorology said there was major flooding in the Wide Bay and Burnett regions, north of Brisbane, causing highways to close and cutting off some towns.  Marodian near Gympie received more than 670mm in the 24 hours to 9am with many other areas receiving at least 300mm. The Bruce Highway north of #Gympie right now 🚨Our crews are working hard to get the network open again after severe flash flooding across #WideBayBurnett as a result of ex #TCSeth overnight. pic.twitter.com/XjpjS7Xmr5 The Bruce Highway reopened late Saturday morning after the downpour forced it to close earlier. There were warnings for more heavy rain on Saturday and authorities issued an emergency alert for Maryborough, urging people to reconsider travel. Queensland Police confirmed one person had drowned after his vehicle became submerged in flood waters at Kanigan, Wide Bay on Friday night. Police and emergency services responded to reports of a ute being swept off the road on Cherry Tree Road near the Bruce Highway about 7.30pm. The driver, a 22-year-old Sunshine Coast man, was found inside the vehicle on Saturday morning. No one else was in the car at the time.

Eight of those were now safe, but the remaining 15 people were unaccounted for with rescue crews unable to access many areas. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said the flood event was unexpected. “As the bureau said with this severe weather event, no one was expecting it to sit and stay and produce thunderstorms that were not moving. “This was an unexpected event from the bureau’s point of view and they were sending out information as it came to hand. And also, alerting the mayors in the local council as well.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Wild storms have also lashed Victoria, bringing large hail stones and flash floods. The Victorian State Emergency Service received 848 calls in the 24 hours to Saturday, mostly due to flooding and building damage overnight. The SES duty officer, Geb Abbott, told ABC Radio about a dozen cases were people calling to be rescued. “There were some events where rescues had to be enacted just with people that had been stuck in flood water,” she said.
