4/17/2022,"Richoux, 172 Piccadilly, London W1J 9EJ (020 3375 1000). Starters £6.95-£12.95, mains £8.95-£19.95, desserts £6.75-£7.95, wines from £24 The day after I had dinner at Richoux, I went on Google Street View in an attempt to answer a simple question: what was it specifically about the place that had made me stride past for so many years, my nose in the air, convinced it was unworthy of my attention? I found it in an image from August 2014. There was a sandwich board outside on the pavement of London’s Piccadilly offering “Any breakfast with a hot drink and juice for £9.95”. It was illustrated by a grimly anaemic, grossly unappetising photo of eggs Benedict. Under its dollop of pale, industrial-looking hollandaise, it presented as something you might wish to treat with a broad-spectrum antibiotic, rather than eat. It all looked rather desperate and needy. London is full of places we might choose to walk past on instinct: “Scottish” steak houses offering sides straight from the deep freeze, Chinese buffets where the Day-Glo orange food festers under heat lamps, branches of Pizza Hut where they’ll flog you a pie with a crust stuffed with cysts of cheese burger. They always seem full. I’ve often wanted to run in and bawl at the punters to save themselves; to tell them they could do so much better. But that would be the act of a spittle-flecked, raging madman and anyway, if they couldn’t be bothered to do some basic research, what business was it of mine? The fact is I’d always had Richoux in that category. I didn’t know what it was for. Perhaps that was grossly unfair. After all, I had never even stepped inside. Over the years the brand had expanded. There were other Richoux branches in Knightsbridge, St John’s Wood, Mayfair and even Port Solent, but the pandemic did for them. In January 2021, the parent company was put into administration and all of them closed. The Richoux name, and the premises on Piccadilly, was bought by Naveen Handa, part of the family behind the Cairn Group of hotels and restaurants. What he’s done with it is glorious. He’s created an extremely good-value, stylish brasserie deserving of its prime location on one of the capital’s grandest streets. He has installed two chefs, Jamie Butler and Lewis Spencer, both from the much-garlanded Moor Hall in Lancashire. They, in turn, have put that cutting-edge kitchen experience to one side and instead written a pitch-perfect menu of beautifully executed crowd-pleasers. After trading for 113 years, Richoux has become an instant classic. Although I never ate there, I glanced inside a few times over the years, and it always seemed rather dark and dour with lots of heavy wood and sombre colours. It’s not like that any more. The smart alcoves down each side of the room have been retained along with the brass light fittings, but the whole thing has been lightened: peach walls, pale blue banquettes, a new tiled floor in a scallop shell design. They’ve kept the dessert cabinet just inside the door, and filled it with Butler’s snowy meringue-encased gateaux and jam and cream-topped cruffins, a cross between a croissant and muffin. The closest thing to innovation here is a plate of raw tuna and watermelon, cut into identically sized pink and purple cubes, then given a squeeze of lime, peppery olive oil and a little mint. Otherwise, it’s a menu of old friends; of dishes you could imagine happily eating on any day of the week and quite possibly at any time. Have the French onion soup for £6.95, topped by a garlic crouton laden with toasted gruyère, or a Caesar salad for the same price. There’s beef carpaccio, or creamy burrata with the pertest of tomatoes. A jumbo prawn cocktail is all the good things, assembled with care. There’s a little blitzed and seasoned avocado at the bottom, then crisp leaves of baby gem lettuce, topped with squeakily fresh prawns under just the right amount of Marie Rose sauce and finished with a dusting of smoked paprika. And for a main? There’s a grilled fillet of sea bream with salsa verde, or a crisp-skinned, thick-cut fillet of salmon on a black rice salad, with a little pickled cucumber and artichoke, both at £15.95. Feeling flush? The ribeye is £19.95, but for a fiver less there’s also a flat iron. They tell me they’ve just run out of that, but can substitute with bavette, one of those steak cuts which trades tenderness for flavour. Bring all your own teeth. It is perfectly cooked and comes with a rocket and parmesan salad, a shiny metal beaker of good chips and an unimprovable béarnaise. Or just stop here for a chicken club sandwich or a croque monsieur or smoked salmon with scrambled eggs. One of those, and a glass of wine, and you’ll barely break £15. I love the diversity and vivacity of the London restaurant scene, really I do. But sometimes reading those menus full of innovation and thrills and umami and tahini and charred hispi can be utterly exhausting. Sometimes I just want to be brought something nice to eat. The menu at Richoux is the promise of nice things to eat, executed in an elegant, dark blue sans serif font. Until now Brasserie Zedel just up the road at Piccadilly Circus had had this territory pretty much to itself. They’ve now got serious competition. My companion for dinner was late. To be fair he is always late, which is odd because he’s a gifted jazz musician with extraordinary timing. Tonight, he was so late that we had to forgo dessert or we’d miss the gig we were attending. Hence, I came back a couple of days later and raided the dessert counter, because it is my job to do so. I took home the good stuff. The star is the individual apple tarte tatin, with crisp caramelised pastry and sweet, toffeed fruit. It’s £4.95 to take away or £7.95 to eat in where it comes with ice-cream or crème anglaise. Or perhaps a wedge of that gateau with its layers of light sponge and mascarpone cream, finished with soft Swiss meringue, its surface blowtorched to a caramel brown. Do not miss the sugar-crusted, jam-filled wonder that is the cruffin. Oh, just have it all. Regularly, I am asked to recommend somewhere “nice” to eat in central London, by which I assume they mean somewhere classy and civilised and unchallenging and not ruinously expensive. Richoux is my new best answer. The venerable Castle Hotel in Taunton, which has been owned and run by the Chapman family for three generations, has appointed a new head chef, who happens to be an old one. Andrew Swann started at The Castle as a commis chef in 2000. He has since worked for Zafferano and L’Escargot in London, among others. ‘I fell in love with cooking when I first started my career here,’ he has said. ‘And to be able to come back so many years later to continue that journey is really special for me.’ The kitchens of the Castle have recently undergone a £150,000 renovation. See the-castle-hotel.com. Sandwich maestro Max Halley has teamed up with restaurant group Burger & Lobster to create two limited edition lobster rolls which will be available until 6 June. The lobster cocktail roll costs £26 and features lobster, Marie Rose sauce and all the accessories. The fish and chip lobster roll, for the same price, brings in tartar sauce, a pea and mint purée and crushed salt and vinegar crisps. At burgerandlobster.com. The arrival this month of mandatory calorie counts on menus for restaurant operators with 250 staff or more was awaited with trepidation. Many restaurateurs complained that it would introduce great costs both for the calculations and menu reprinting. The solution to the latter lies in the approach by the nationwide Ivy Collection group. They’ve retained the non-calorie count menus, but are supplying a card with a QR code for both nutritional and allergen information.

4/17/2022,"After a seemingly interminable winter, this weekend is finally a good time to start planting up window boxes, and with two handy tips, you can have them churning out a conveyor belt of colour right up until the first frosts. Gardening in containers offers a range of benefits. It frees you up to grow plants that might not otherwise thrive in your local soil type; you can raise colour to eye level and beyond, allowing you to decorate whole buildings in living green; and, of course, it provides even those with no garden at all a vital horticultural fix. However, container-growing does come with two hefty downsides. Their comparatively tiny volume compared to garden soil means they will always dry out quickly, which can mean daily watering at the height of summer. The same goes for fertiliser, which not only is a lot of extra work, but extra expense, too. This combination means that many bedding plants – that have been selected for their sky-high metabolisms to fuel fast growth – can run out of steam from July. But things don’t have to be this way. First, consider your container. The larger it is, the slower it will dry out, with the added benefit of being less prone to wide temperature fluctuations, too, which can hamper growth. It’s also worth picking a pot made from nonporous material. Unglazed terracotta is filled with tiny pores, which means moisture constantly leaches out. Metals, such as aluminium and zinc, can heat up too fast on warm days and burn delicate roots. Resins and composites, for me, provide the best of both worlds. They not only seal moisture in, but often have thick walls, too, which acts as insulation. Now, let’s talk growing media. Traditionally, they would have been compost-based, made up of plant fibres, such as environmentally disastrous peat, or wood pulp. These were introduced in the mid-20th century because they are lighter weight and thus cost less to transport, and by extension are more profitable for corporations to flog. Containing few of the minerals needed for plant growth, they conveniently also lock you into the need to buy fertiliser. This breaks down over time so it needs to be repurchased every spring. Growing media also have the infuriating habit of being hydrophobic when allowed to dry out, actively repelling water instead of absorbing it. Soil-based mixes, by contrast, suffer none of these problems and are usually sold under the label John Innes (a generic term that refers to soil-based formulas – it’s not a trade name). Now, of course, there is a balance here – larger boxes filled with soil-based media will be significantly heavier, so you will need to bear this in mind in relation to the support you have available. However, in the vast majority of incidences, these swaps should be easily accommodated, saving you time and money, being better for the planet and giving you a longer season of colour to enjoy. So, get on out there this weekend and plant a window box. A simple act that makes your world a more beautiful place and gives us, in our own small way, hope of good things to come. Something I think we could all do with right now.

4/17/2022,"Two years of mass Covid testing have paved the way for a revolution in how we diagnose other diseases, the founding director of the Lighthouse labs network has said. In his first interview since the pandemic began, Prof Chris Molloy said that people’s familiarity with using swabs for Covid tests meant that they could also discover and monitor their risk of other conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease. On 1 April, the government ended free Covid tests for most people as part of what ministers describe as a “living with Covid” strategy, which has seen much of the Covid surveillance and research system dismantled. The national research studies and England’s NHS test and trace system relied on seven Lighthouse labs to process most of the 207m free PCR tests done during the pandemic in the UK. Molloy led the team setting up the network, which was created after the previous public health laboratory system had faced a series of cuts by successive governments. Now most are being shut down, leaving the Rosalind Franklin lab in Leamington Spa as the main facility in England, and more than 1,000 scientists and technicians looking for other jobs. Molloy expressed some disappointment that the other labs were not being repurposed. “One of the things we hoped was to be able to create a foundation for the UK diagnostics sector,” he said, adding that he had once hoped the labs themselves might continue. “But it may be that the biggest foundation we’ve actually created is the thousands of high-quality staff who’ve been trained in extraordinarily high-quality science, who are now filtering across the nation.” There is an opportunity to create another legacy for the Lighthouse labs and the testing system, Molloy said.“The population has been schooled in ordering a test online, getting it through the post, doing it in the home, popping it back in the post, getting a result on their phone, and most importantly changing their behaviour as a result.” Having lab capacity and smart diagnostics could help tackle chronic ill-health, he said. One in three adults in the UK have a long-term condition such as kidney disease, heart failure or diabetes, and having two chronic health problems in middle age may double the risk of dementia. “If you really want to address multi-morbidities and diseases associated with ageing, you start with people in their 30s, 40s and 50s,” Molloy said. “Not with older people, when you’re playing clinical whack-a-mole. “This is not Beveridge 1.0, which was the establishment delivering for the populace. This is Beveridge 2.0, where the populace can engage in their own health and use smart diagnostics in the home or the high street to start to understand their own health at a time when you actually may be able to do something to steer away from long-term disease, rather than just treat it.” William Beveridge published the report that was the foundation of the welfare state and NHS in 1942, offering a vision of hope during war, and Molloy urged ministers and others to show a similar vision for healthcare when the pandemic has ended. Government, academia, the NHS and the private sector had shared a new “singularity of purpose”, he said. “We blew holes through the walls between disciplines [to respond to the pandemic]. We must make sure those walls don’t get rebuilt.” “When I was establishing the Lighthouse network, every day people would assume that their answer would be yes, before you asked the question. Every sector of the community – the NHS, industry, academia, everyone. The military were helping move 400 pieces of capital equipment around the nation to be able to centre them on the sites that we chose. “Universities and small companies gave their instruments to us, and even wrote messages of good luck on the back. How brilliant and inspiring is that?” Molloy said the sense of purpose created by Covid could be applied to other areas: “Multi-morbidities, ageing, cancers and so on. And I think government is able to keep the purpose alive, and that flame burning. Government has a role. Medical research charities have a massive role. “We should remember that all of these things – in health and healthcare and testing and medicines discovery – are a global business. So what we develop here and prove here can be sold worldwide, for the betterment not just of health in the UK but the world.”",News/World news,"Lessons from Covid can start a health revolution, says lab chief",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/17/lessons-learned-from-covid-can-start-a-health-revolution-lighthouse-labs-chris-molloy
4/17/2022,"Countries that allow economic inequality to increase as they grow richer make their citizens less happy, a new study shows. Until now, researchers have believed that inequality was largely irrelevant to levels of life satisfaction, according to Dr David Bartram at the University of Leicester. But his study of 78 countries spanning four decades – the largest longitudinal research of its kind – punctures that myth, he said. “When inequality increases, people with high incomes don’t benefit much from their gains – many rich people are focused on those who have even more than they do, and they never feel they have enough,” Bartram said. “But people who earn little really suffer from falling further behind – they feel excluded and frustrated by not being able to keep up even with people who receive average incomes.” Bartram’s research, which is due to be presented at the British Sociological Association’s online annual conference on 21 April, examined survey data of life satisfaction levels, where people rate their life satisfaction on a scale of one to 10, and linked it to Gini coefficient numbers – a measure of inequality – from 1981 to 2020. In 1981, as the UK was gripped by a recession, life satisfaction stood at 7.7. But during the economic boom of the 1980s, inequality grew, and the research shows that the happiness figure dropped to 7.4 by 1999. However, as measures to reduce inequality began to take effect, happiness slowly returned so that by 2018, life satisfaction stood at 7.8. “The data from the UK feeds into a more general finding – in wealthy countries increased inequality has a substantial negative impact on life satisfaction, and inequality has increased in most wealthy countries in recent decades,” Bartram said. This link between higher inequality and lower life satisfaction is repeated elsewhere, Bartram said. Any country that moved from the lowest quarter of countries in terms of inequality to the highest quarter saw a decrease in life satisfaction of about 0.4 on the 10-point scale, he found. India’s life satisfaction declined from 6.7 in 1990 to 5.8 in 2006 as inequality rose. By 2012 it was still lower than in 1990, despite the country’s prolonged economic boom. The US and Australia also both saw pronounced falls in life satisfaction, but those countries where inequality had fallen were generally happier, such as Poland, Peru, Mexico and Ukraine, before the Russian invasion. The lesson for policymakers is that inequality matters, Bartram said. “In some of the previous research, you see people saying ‘inequality isn’t that big a deal, so all efforts to address inequality are misguided because inequality is beneficial’. “I think that’s misguided – inequality is generally damaging to people’s life satisfaction so we should pay attention to efforts to mitigate it,” he said.",News/Inequality,Rich countries that let inequality run rampant make citizens unhappy,https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2022/apr/17/rich-countries-that-let-inequality-run-rampant-make-citizens-unhappy
4/17/2022,"Religion: so awkward, right? One of the most uncomfortable topics that exists, probably, up there with Brexit and the Will Smith slap. The fact that 85% of the human population identify with some kind of faith group doesn’t make it any easier to discuss. If you have a set of beliefs, however well-meaning and humane, they’re bound to set you on a course of divergence from those who hold alternate ones, or none at all, as our world has found to its repeated and tragic cost. Small wonder that some in the remaining 15% feel outright hostility to the very concept of faith. It’s this anomaly that the evolutionary psychologist Robin Dunbar tackles in his newly published book How Religion Evolved: And Why It Endures. The desire to reach out and feel part of something transcendent, beyond human cognition, can be observed in every culture known to history and Dunbar notes the evolutionary and societal advantages of our religious impulse, while capturing its flipside too. The very thing that creates such positive bonds between humans with shared beliefs is also responsible for the division and conflict they cause. And yet, says Dunbar, “it is difficult to see any convincing evidence for anything that will replace [religion] in human affairs”. That’s certainly worth pondering at the end of a week that has seen the unusual confluence of three of the world’s major religious holidays: Ramadan, Passover and Easter. Such a convergence only occurs three times a century and results in a rare opportunity for believers to observe the similarities of their rituals and beliefs, as opposed to their differences. Last week, I was invited to an iftar meal at which a number of the guests spoke of their practices during Ramadan and the inspiration behind them. As a Christian whose approach to the supposed self-denial of Lent has been pretty lackadaisical down the years, it was a challenge as well as an inspiration to witness how the people surrounding me engaged with their own fasting season. It was, too, the first time I’d experienced such resonance with Islam’s daily rhythm of prayer in the church’s Holy Week offerings of morning prayer, lunchtime Eucharist, evensong and compline. One woman at dinner was asked what her faith meant to her. Everything, she said: it determined how she saw her place in the world, the values she held and the choices she made, the way she conducted her relationships. I recognised not just the response but the ease and enthusiasm with which she spoke. My own faith has waxed, waned and wobbled over the years, but I have known the times when it brings joy and confidence and meaning to life and something in me vibrated with a sympathetic delight. I’ve also, of course, watched plenty of friends lose their faith, always for the same reasons I could imagine one day losing mine, be it the suffering of others or the disappointments of life or the irrationality of religion. The big one, perhaps, is the impossibility of belief in some unseen being with human interests at heart when the world can be so cruel and unjust. And a Maundy Thursday encounter with Francis Bacon’s paintings at the Royal Academy was a sharp reminder to me that humans are fleshly creatures with animalistic impulses. The popes and crucifixions that recur so frequently in Bacon’s imagery don’t speak of redemption or eternity but of futility, mortality and horror. Some of the canvases are so confronting that I wondered whether the gallery should run special late-night viewings at which visitors are permitted to howl. But a different exhibition offered another perspective, one that will stay with me for an equally long time. For anyone who hasn’t spent much time thinking about our prehistoric forebears, the British Museum’s current show about Stonehenge is a revelation. Last summer, on visiting the monument itself, I was confronted by my ignorance of the cultures responsible for it, but the World of Stonehenge is the perfect corrective. It immerses you in the humanity of 5,000 years ago, the people who lived and worked together not just to survive but to increase their knowledge of the universe and to create extraordinary things. Transporting displays of finds from both Salisbury Plain and all over bronze age Britain helps us see these seemingly remote people as men and women just like us: smart and competent and resourceful and inquisitive. One discovery shows two separate cultures communing with each other, the last of the hunter-gatherers joining the first of the farmers for a remarkable shared feast that couldn’t help but prompt memories of an Oklahoma song: “Oh! The farmer and the cowman should be friends…” And, yes, humans back then were working out their own power dynamics too, discovering ways to accumulate wealth and prestige, to wield authority. We’re made of the same stuff, with the same needs and wants and drives. Five millennia don’t take you as far as you’d think. We’re still the same human race that has leant on faith and sought the spiritual throughout our entire existence. That sense of commonality with the past has merged, in my mind, with the communality of the religious rituals that have taken place all over the globe last week. Millions of people have devoted time, thought and self-discipline to honour something outside themselves, to seek a more universal good than their own. In an individualistic age that encourages narcissistic ways of thinking, in a geopolitical climate where leaders serve their own egos, that’s not nothing. It’s easy to perceive religion as a hangover from our collective, pre-scientific past, to write it off as the thing humans did before we understood the world we lived in. But perhaps today, overloaded with information as we are, its offer is as relevant as ever – a sense of perspective, a turning of focus away from ourselves, a way to make peace with the things we still cannot make sense of or will not see changed in our lifetime. If faith can unify us at all, it is in our mutual humility.  Emma John’s book, Self Contained: Scenes From a Single Life, is out now",Opinion/Opinion,Let’s be honest - faiths divide us.

4/17/2022,"The American director Robert Eggers established himself as a singular cinematic voice with the chilling 17th-century “New England Folktale” The Witch, and followed it up with The Lighthouse, an immersive dream of mermaids and murder. Both movies had an atmosphere you could taste, and made virtues of their relatively low budgets, conjuring expansive worlds from meagre resources. Enter The Northman, a Viking epic, its budget reportedly in excess of $70m, that comes on like a head-smashing mashup of Beowulf, Hamlet (Eggers and Shakespeare share a Scandinavian legend source) and Nicolas Winding Refn’s Valhalla Rising, told in growly tones that are more Dark Knight than Green Knight. Co-written with Icelandic poet Sjón, and described by Eggers as an attempt to make “the definitive Viking movie”, it’s as ambitious as it is preposterous and, at times, ponderous – filled with garbled epithets about vengeance and fate that are whispered, muttered, or blood-curdlingly yelled. This is a story of children “born of savagery”, in which tormented men spurn happiness to dive into icy waters in search of a fight, while mothers-to-be howl like banshees at the gods; a story with chapters that take place “Years Later”, and that lead us to “The Gates of Hell”. Understatement is not on the menu. We open in the Orkney/Shetland-adjacent fictional kingdom of Hrafnsey in AD895, Here, King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) is murdered by his half-brother Fjölnir (Claes Bang) in front of his young son, Amleth (Oscar Novak), who then witnesses his mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), being carried off screaming. “I will avenge you father; I will save you mother; I will kill you Fjölnir!” becomes the battle cry of Amleth, who grows up to become an iron-hearted berserker, played with muscular vulnerability by Alexander Skarsgård, in the land of Rus. An impressive extended shot (one of many) tracks an intoxicated raid on a Slavic village, delivering axes in heads (characters in The Northman are identified by missing parts of their faces) as poultry flap in the background amid Pythonesque mud. An encounter with a visionary seeress (an elaborately headdressed Björk) sets Amleth on a roundabout course to Iceland, branding himself a slave in order to infiltrate his uncle’s circle. On arrival, he headbutts a man to a pulp while playing a sport that looks like a cross between quidditch and rollerball, thereby winning the approval of his estranged mother, who is now living with Fjölnir. It’s an arrangement she seems to enjoy, although Amleth knows she’s just acting – and there’s a lot of acting in The Northman: some pouty, some scowly, some beefy, some shouty – all delivered in the film’s occasionally ridiculous Nordic-sounding English language (shades of The Last Duel’s accent salads). Amleth also acquires an Arthurian-style blade that can only be unsheathed under foretold circumstances, and teams up with Olga (The Witch’s breakout star, Anya Taylor-Joy), who tells him: “Your strength breaks men’s bones. I have the cunning to break their minds.” Eggers has always had an astute eye for that strange crossover between this world and the next, mixing earthy tactility with otherworldly dreams in impressively matter-of-fact fashion. That quality is to the fore in The Northman, which at times reminded me of the living comic-book aesthetic of Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez’s Sin City, not least when the monochrome noir of night-time exteriors is broken by the golden glow of firelit interiors – a key motif. Yet for all its visual coups (breathtaking scenery, evocatively captured by cinematographer Jarin Blaschke) and multilayered soundtrack (composers Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough place us right there in the landscape), there’s something oddly plodding about Amleth’s bloody mission. While the Norns-of-fate narrative may contrive several reversals of fortune and sympathy, there’s little of the genuinely uncanny weirdness that made Eggers’s first two features such a treat. What madness lies herein is not of the north-northwest variety but more in keeping with the bonkers blockbuster spectacle of Darren Aronofsky’s Noah. In last week’s Observer, Eggers spoke of the pressure to deliver “the most entertaining Robert Eggers movie I could make”. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the result feels uncharacteristically familiar as it marauds toward a final act pitched somewhere between Conan the Barbarian and Anakin’s last moments from Revenge of the Sith, with just a hint of the manly fireside wrestling of Women in Love. The end result could happily play on a double bill with either Zardoz or Thor. Whether that will prove a strength or a weakness with the all-important multiplex audiences remains to be seen.",Arts/Film,"The Northman review – Robert Eggers’s ambitious, preposterous Viking epic",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/17/the-northman-review-robert-eggers-alexander-skarsgard-anya-taylor-joy-nicole-kidman-bjork
4/17/2022,"It’s been a week since the labelling of calories on restaurant menus was made mandatory in England, and what a week. What a week! The first day saw diners gazing into the menus as if deep lakes or mirrors, their eyes finally focusing on these new codes, printed jauntily under the chips. Some tried texting the numbers, only to receive error messages or adverts from sim-card manufacturers. Some worried they were new prices, under Brexit. Some assumed they were star ratings from previous customers, the carbonara performing particularly well, the carrot sticks abominable. As the week continued, its days unfolding like a picnic blanket, the British public found itself changing. On day two, people picked up their menus tentatively, as if boobytrapped. The cryptic numbers, they’d learned, in a series of hurriedly called town meetings and late night WhatsApp conversations, were a cipher – the higher numbers were bad and caused death, while the lower numbers were righteous and good, though may lead to occasional headaches in the afternoon. But still, people were drawn to the foods their bodies told them they wanted – the baguettes, the croquettes with the internal cheese that burns the tongue in a way that’s fabulous, the large plate of meat with a shaving of parsley and an exquisitely carved garnish of carrot in the shape of a duck. It was a confusing day, and that night they slept badly in sheets of guilt, their dreams taking the form of deathly pastas and puddings that burned. Day three began at dawn. A number of people had gathered to get to the bottom of this “calorie labelling”, and they were doing this by travelling around their cities to interrogate as many meals as possible – they took breakfast, elevenses, brunch, lunch, dinner, tea and supper, noting the calories in a little notebook with integral penholder. Elsewhere, people were taking it in turns to stare into the eye of a Five Guys cheeseburger and whisper appalling things. Bad foods needed to be punished – men took it in turns with the spade, digging a pit in the softer mud beside the river, and one by one people arrived to throw in the lunches they didn’t eat, muttering curses, first upon the foods, which came together in a bright and oily stew, and then upon themselves, for wanting them. How weak they were, how lazy. Having purged, they queued on the shore for a simple kale caesar salad, and shared such tips as: did you know, it uses more calories to eat a stick of celery than it does to stand very still in a storm of your own making? Did you know, breakfast is the most important meal of the day? Did you know that? There was an air of excitement as day four began… Something was happening. Obesity was receding before their very eyes as men and women were choosing health! Shedding layers of ignorance and incompetence as if cardigans, they moved forwards as one with joy and a certain lightness of head that could be pleasurable at times, a reminder of their hard work. Through hunger they marched, batting whingers out of the way, those who shouted things like, “Exacerbating situations of people with disordered eating!” and “Outdated calculations don’t consider people’s age, size or activity levels!” and “Calories tell you nothing about a food!” and “Everyone processes food differently!” It was sad, but some people couldn’t be helped, that’s nature. On day five, one third of England’s restaurants closed down, some making statements, such as: “We at Humperdink’s Family Steakhouse, est 1974, have become aware of the errors of our ways,” others sharing rumours of staff being told to take large bites out of muffins in order to reduce their calorie content. Whistleblowers reported that the staff members who refused, unwilling to risk increasing their own calorie intake, were respectfully fired. A butter factory burned down in mysterious circumstances, but nobody was badly hurt and the air smelled amazing. Day six was a great day, because that was the day England solved its relationship with food. What had been a difficult, sometimes toxic connection, confused by memory, metaphor, gender and class, a relationship of forbidden desires and grief, and late-night cravings, and the curry your mum used to make, and hurriedly eaten chocolates, was suddenly sluiced clean of shame and made good. All it took, it turned out, was a teaspoon of information about energy, popped on the menu. The answer had been in front of England’s nose the whole time. Eating-disorder charities, no longer required, used their remaining funds to put on a modest street party and everybody danced and sang, late into the night. On day seven, there was a feast, to celebrate the changed minds and shape of England. Families reunited, hugging and apologising for decade-old slights, mothers and daughters laughing together over juice.

4/17/2022,"Twelve years ago Jeff Bewkes, then chief executive of Time Warner, compared Netflix to the Albanian army. “It’s a little bit like, is the Albanian army going to take over the world? I don’t think so,” Bewkes told the New York Times, disparaging the streaming service’s ability to take on the established media players. Well, the Albanian army won. Time Warner followed Netflix into streaming, NBCUniversal and Disney came after and so it carried on. In Britain, BBC and ITV invested in their streaming portals. Media was now living in Netflix’s world. In the years that followed, hit after hit – from Stranger Things to Bridgerton – cemented Netflix’s position as the world’s leading streaming service. Subscribers boomed as the coronavirus made much of the world shut-ins. And then in January the boom appeared to be over. ​​ Globally Netflix announced it expected to add only 2.5 million new subscribers in the first three months of the year, well down on the 4 million in the first quarter of 2021. The news has helped wipe almost $45bn (£33bn) from its value as investors worried Netflix’s glory days were over. On Tuesday Netflix releases its latest quarterly results. And some analysts worry that increased competition from Apple, Amazon, Disney and traditional media players means the Albanian army is finally on the run. The narrative was further reinforced last month when Coda beat Jane Campion’s Power of the Dog for the year’s best picture Oscar. The heartwarming story of a child of deaf adults was produced by Apple, Campion’s critically lauded neo-western was produced by Netflix. It was the first time that a movie released by a streaming service had won the top Oscar. Having redefined the media landscape Netflix was in trouble and now – for some – it time for Netflix to change its game. For Laura Martin, an analyst at Needham & Co, what was once Netflix’s key strength has become its biggest weakness. In the previous quarter, Netflix released the biggest TV show of the year, Squid Game, and its two biggest film releases ever, Red Notice and Don’t Look Up. The company spent an eye-watering $17bn (£13bn) on content in 2021 and is expected to spend about $19bn in 2022. But that hasn’t been enough to maintain the kind of growth Wall Street has become accustomed to. “Originals and entertainment content is no longer enough,” said Martin. “Our thesis is that you must have news and sport. You must have breaking news because that brings in people when, say, Russia invades Ukraine or sports because when there is a really good game then people flock to you and stay there.” Entertainment alone, she argues, is just too narrow and the company’s success may have blinded them to the need to offer a wider variety of content. When Netflix started, its main rivals in the US, its largest market, were cable companies that offered sports and news as well as entertainment but at a far higher price. “At the beginning when it was $15 a month and they had great library content from all the big studios, that was a really good deal,” she said. “Now that all the big boys are in the business, they all have much bigger libraries than Netflix and they have news and sports. The competitive landscape has changed for Netflix and they aren’t changing.” But while Netflix may not be growing as fast as it once was, it is far too early to write it off. Even another disappointing quarter – and another share price fall – is unlikely to dent the streaming company’s enormous power in a media world that is still playing catchup. Globally Netflix had 222 million subscribers at the end of last year. People spent 1.65bn hours viewing Squid Game in its first four weeks. And it’s still one of the ​​best-performing stocks of the past two decades, gaining more than 34,000% since the company’s 2002 initial public offering. It made a profit of $5.1bn in 2021 and its content budget dwarfs most of its traditional media rivals. There has been a “reset” said Brian Wieser, global president of business intelligence at media agency GroupM. In part that reset is an “acknowledgment that the economics of the streaming business are not as good as the traditional media business”. But that traditional media business is still in trouble and, if you take a stand back and look at what Netflix and its peers are doing to the media landscape, he argues, it is clear that streaming is here to stay and it’s the traditional media companies who remain most at risk. “We are transitioning to a much more globalised economy and this is a much more globalised media industry than it has ever been,” said Wieser. Hits such as South Korea’s Squid Game and All of Us Are Dead show that Netflix remains the leader in that global market. “They are just so much bigger in this space that growth is naturally going to be more limited,” he said. “That doesn’t mean the business is weak, or the long-term profit profile isn’t solid.” “Sometimes we lose a sense of perspective on these things,” said Wieser. “When you still have one of the most valuable media companies on earth and you are still arguably one of, if not the, most impactful media companies because of how much you spend on content, were the last results really disappointing or was it about expectations being mismatched?” In the meantime the streaming world continues to chew up the business of traditional ad-supported television and cable and that, combined with the global vision Netflix has brought to media, gives it and its rivals plenty of room for growth. Competitors may have crowed at Netflix’s new year crisis but the fall has dented neither the scale of its ambitions nor the depths of its pockets. The UK’s ITV recently announced a new streaming platform, ITVX, it hopes will be a “national champion” in the battle for British viewers​​ against the streaming giants. The media company’s overall content budget is expected to be £1.23bn this year . Netflix alone will spend 11 times that. In the US consumers spent about $140bn on professional video content last year from cable content and theatrical admissions to streaming services and purchases of physical media. Streaming services account for about $30bn of that money; cable still takes $100bn but is still losing subscribers. From 2016 to 2021, pay TV lost more than 50 million adult viewers in the US and fewer than half of all US households will have a cable TV subscription by 2023, according to study by Insider Intelligence. Arguably even its recent loses show that Netflix is winning. The fact that this year’s best picture battle was a battle between Apple and Netflix shows just how firmly the streamers are embedded. The days when Netflix was the Albanian army may be over but the truth is media companies are all Albanians now.",News/Media,If Netflix is stumbling will Wall Street renew or cancel?,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/17/if-netflix-is-stumbling-will-wall-street-renew-or-cancel
4/17/2022,"In terms of western relations with Vladimir Putin, Bill Browder has performed the role of the canary in the coalmine – or perhaps goldmine would be more fitting. A graduate of Stanford Business School, he arrived in Moscow in the late 1990s, via a stint in London, determined to make his fortune. As his previous book, Red Notice, detailed, that’s exactly what he did. He set up Hermitage Capital Management, with the help of the Monaco-based billionaire Edmond Safra (later to die in a fire started by one of his servants). It was a time of wild profiteering, as post-Soviet state assets were sold off on the cheap, and a venal oligarchy was created. Business feuds were regularly settled by bullets, and the life expectancy of bankers was radically shortened. When Putin came to power on New Year’s Eve 1999, promising to stamp out corruption, Browder was a relieved man. And he remained pro-Putin for the next three years, as the new Russian leader imposed state order on capitalist anarchy. In these years, Browder made a fortune, turning Hermitage into the largest foreign portfolio investor in Russia. His big innovation was shareholder activism, in which he targeted corrupt practices in some of the biggest companies, such as Gazprom, and by doing so raised their share price. Then in 2003 Putin jailed Mikhail Khodorkovsky, at the time the richest oligarch in Russia, and instead of opposing corruption, began putting the squeeze on the duly intimidated oligarchy. That meant putting a stop to Browder’s busy-bodying by deporting him from Russia in 2005. Eighteen months later, Hermitage’s offices were raided by the Russian authorities and its paperwork removed. Those documents were then used by officers from the interior ministry to stage a $230m (£175m) tax rebate scam. They then blamed the scam on Browder, and when his lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, exposed the officers responsible for the fraud, those same officers had Magnitsky arrested. Held for almost a year without charge, Magnitsky died a few days before he was due to be released – murdered, says Browder, and a number of independent investigators, by prison guards who beat him to death. Thereafter Browder, a naturalised Briton based in London, dedicated himself to gaining justice for his friend, primarily by lobbying for the Magnitsky Act – a bill that authorised the US government to sanction human rights offenders and freeze their assets. A smilar law has been enacted in 33 other countries, including the UK and EU. Once adopted, however, the Magnitsky law remained mostly unused in the US, and particularly in the UK. It was only after the Russian invasion of Ukraine that the UK authorities belatedly noticed the preponderance of corrupt Russian billionaires laundering their money in London. As Browder informs us at the end of the book, most of the $230m from the tax scam found its way to these shores. Characteristically, the British authorities did nothing about it. But the Russian authorities did. They targeted Browder. He found himself embroiled in a US case against a Russian shell company that had used part of the stolen $230m to buy property in New York. The Russians hired a lawyer who had previously worked for Browder, a conflict of interest that eventually had the lawyer barred, but not before Browder feared his personal information had been passed on to the people who were out to get him. He was also subject to a series of Interpol warrants, and at one stage in the book he is arrested in Madrid under a Russian-requested order. At first he’s not sure if the Spanish police are in fact Russian agents in disguise, and then he’s not sure if he will be held and extradited to Moscow – where he would likely have met the same end as his lawyer. As terrifying as this incident must have been, in a way it pales by comparison with another moment in the book in which Browder recalls the 2018 Helsinki summit between Putin and Donald Trump. Out of the blue, Putin offered to swap some Russian intelligence agents for Browder, and in a joint press conference Trump said that he thought it was “an incredible offer”. Browder was on holiday at his home in Colorado at the time, and imagined that blacked-out secret service land cruisers would arrive and he’d be rendered away to Moscow to face a rigged showtrial and a mysterious death behind bars. It’s an incredible story, told with pace and panache, that reads like a thriller. There’s something deeply offending to our sense of justice about an innocent man framed by powerful forces. It’s a fear that Alexandre Dumas and Alfred Hitchcock tapped into to dramatic effect, but what is most troubling here is how acquiescent the western establishment has been to Russian crimes and lies. Lawyers, politicians and the usual useful idiots have all been successfully recruited to the Russian cause, either through financial inducement, bribery, bovine anti-west sentiments, or perhaps worst of all, complacency. Representatives of each of these groups feature in this book, in which witnesses to Russian corruption die in bizarre circumstances, falling off roofs or from sudden heart attacks. There are also poisonings, threats, intimidation and the whole gamut of dirty tricks. Throughout it all, Browder remains impressively upbeat and resolute. Perhaps the story of one very wealthy man going up against the Russian state seems indulgent against the backdrop of the nightmare unfolding in Ukraine. But they are related events, and as this book makes all too clear, we’ve taken far too long to recognise the true nature of the regime that connects them.

4/17/2022,"It wasn’t as if things had been going brilliantly for Boris Johnson as he attempted to spend some precious downtime last week at Chequers, a bubble of countryside tranquillity away from the escalating cost of living crisis and political woes that had punctuated his year. Already by Tuesday morning, one MP had been expelled from the party after being found guilty of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy. Another had caused outrage for issuing a statement supporting his former colleague – all just weeks before looming local elections. Then, in a sparsely populated Downing Street, the phone rang. The call from the Metropolitan police, made to inform the prime minister that he would be among those fined for attending a Downing Street gathering for his birthday, sent shocked officials into a scramble. It is a measure of the threat it posed that this weekend, after the deployment of a hugely controversial asylum policy and a concerted campaign to prop up the prime minister, his team will be relieved that the number of MPs calling for his resignation has been limited to a dozen or so – and only one minister has quit. Yet as Tory MPs prepared to regroup in Westminster this week, many were already concluding that any predictions that the threat to Johnson’s position had subsided were seriously overdone. “He’s still deep in the woods,” said one former minister. “We’ve got local elections and that is what is holding most colleagues back. But once the locals are done, and if there are more fines, then it does become a very much more difficult terrain. I don’t think it’s signed, sealed and delivered – and they know that in No 10. They’ve been very unnerved.” While the timing of the Met’s phone call during the political recess made it for a scattered No 10 team to formulate a response, it ultimately helped the prime minister. In the hours that followed the news that both Johnson and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, had received a fine, the Tory MP WhatsApp group was silent, with no one wanting to be the first to give their verdict on the leakiest forum in Westminster. All afternoon, the deafening silence was only broken by the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, welcoming the third series of Channel 4’s Derry Girls and South Swindon MP Robert Buckland tweeting his Wordle attempt. Finally, Nadine Dorries, the ultra-loyal culture secretary, led a late charge of cabinet support for the PM. His real saviour, however, came in the unlikely form of Sir Roger Gale – an arch Johnson critic. In a sign that there would be no immediate threat to Johnson’s premiership, he concluded removing him now would be a “gross self-indulgence” while the Ukraine crisis was continuing. Another stroke of luck for Johnson was that, to the surprise of everyone in the government, Sunak was also fined for his attendance at the birthday party event. It could so easily have been different. It is understood that, having arrived early for a meeting, Sunak hovered at the door of the party for some time before entering the room. An unfortunately timed photograph of the chancellor, his allies believe, is to blame for his fine. It meant that those regarding Sunak as the natural successor to Johnson suddenly could not denounce the prime minister, while Sunak could not quit without collapsing the government. Even then, allies said he spent a miserable few hours considering his future, whatever the impact, but backed away from quitting. Despite those slices of fortune, however, several MPs said on Saturday night that the security of Johnson’s position was now being overestimated. All those whom the Observer spoke to thought further fines were inevitable and would be harder to justify. In particular, Johnson’s attendance at a “bring your own booze” event in the Downing Street garden, as well as an alleged party in the Johnsons’ Downing Street flat – which is denied by No 10 – have the greatest potential for damage. “I think the birthday stuff is small beer compared with what is coming,” said one veteran MP. “[Potentially] six more fines? And what about the flat party?” As Tory MPs began wading through their emails at the end of last week, various responses mirrored that of Gale – that “not now” very much did not mean “never”. Many agree the key moment remains the publication of the full Sue Gray report on the Downing Street parties, which will come once all the Partygate fines have been issued. Correspondence from Tory MPs to voters, seen by the Observer, includes Kevin Hollinrake, MP for Thirsk and Malton, who condemned the rule-breaking and added: “There is a requirement within the [ministerial] code that any significant breach would necessitate the tendering of a resignation, and this of course would also apply to the prime minister.” Sir Christopher Chope, an MP on the right of the party, also said ominously: “Before deciding upon what course of action to take, I shall wait for these further reports.” Sir Gary Streeter, the veteran MP for South West Devon, was more blunt. In reply to an email that he said was “one of many”, he stated: “I submitted a letter of no confidence several weeks ago, which was widely reported. My position remains unchanged.” There are also dangerous moments in the week ahead. Apart from the imminent threat of further fines, it is understood MPs have approached the Speaker about referring the prime minister to the privileges committee over whether he misled the house about parties. Other MPs are said to be on the edge. Alex Chalk, the solicitor general, who is regarded as firmly on resignation watch, went as far as he could without resigning in his statement to his local newspaper, saying he would not defend the prime minister’s actions. He is one of five QCs on the frontbench. A sixth, justice minister Lord Wolfson, resigned. The local elections, too, have become pivotal to test public support for Johnson, a leader whom many MPs only supported after being persuaded of his electoral draw. Has anger over Partygate cut through? “I think a lot of [Partygate] has been priced in,” said an MP in a marginal seat. “But that’s not to minimise the damage that’s been done by it. I don’t think any of us should kid ourselves. It’s turned him into a mere mortal as opposed to Super Boris. I don’t think he’s got that sort of lustre – that’s all burned off.” Out on the campaign trail last week, Tory candidates were doing all they could to shift the focus away from national politics. Walking around the Milton Keynes ward of Tattenhoe, Shazna Muzammil talked about parking, potholes and litter. A Tory council candidate, she has centred her campaign on the things she believes matter most to local people. But it is becoming trickier to keep conversations on track. National issues, including partygate and the cost of living, keep coming up on doorsteps. “What’s going on nationally … it does definitely make it harder,” said Muzammil, 44. “The prime minister is doing well on Ukraine, but people never talk to you about that because they have nothing to complain about.” Tattenhoe, a relatively affluent pocket of Milton Keynes characterised by green spaces and attractive new housing developments, has two Conservative councillors and one Labour. Next month, the Labour seat is up for grabs – an opportunity Muzammil hopes to grasp. Last year, the Tories gained six seats across Milton Keynes to become the biggest party on the council, although no party has overall control. Whether they will win new voters or cling on to their existing ones is uncertain. In Milton Keynes last week, some Tory supporters admitted their allegiance was wavering, while other voters remained on the fence. Frederick, 77, a former engineer from the market town of Stony Stratford, voted for the Conservative candidate in the last local elections, inspired by the national leadership. “It seemed to be going all right – things seemed quite level,” he said. Partygate has made him question whether it is worth voting at all. “You feel as though you can’t trust them – what they say or what they do,” he said. “Boris Johnson lied – there’s no doubt about it. I feel sorry for the people who had friends and relatives dying in hospital and they couldn’t go in and say goodbye. And they’re having bloody parties.” He will decide who to vote for locally “after a pint”, he said. “But it won’t be Conservative,” he added. He has previously voted for Labour candidates, but he is “not that sure” about the party’s leadership. “Maybe it’d be a good idea to go for the Lib Dems.” Another local, Vicky Elizabeth, 39, a teacher from Bletchley, is considering voting for the Liberal Democrats. She wants councillors to focus on environmental issues and the regeneration of the high street, as well as improving safety for residents, and is “keeping an open mind”. But she said: “I can’t imagine it’ll be Conservative, even if locally they were standing up for something amazing. With the changes in education and Tory sleaze … there’s too much water under the bridge at the moment.” However, despite some public anger – with one Tory describing Johnson as a “hypocrite” and another calling him the “better of two evils” – many Conservative voters remain loyal to the party and its leader. Back in Tattenhoe, the criticism from many Conservative voters was gentle. One local, a 49-year-old personal assistant, said Johnson and Sunak should “be punished and held accountable”, but added: “I will still vote for the Tories, to be honest. They’ve got us through the past few years better than some other countries.” Other Tory MPs critical of Johnson confirm that while there is apathy for their party, voters were not yet embracing Labour. “Our view on the doorstep was people are pissed off with us, but there’s no appetite for Labour,” said one northern MP. Between now and the elections, the Downing Street strategy is simple: keep busy. After the announcement that asylum seekers would be sent to Rwanda, which pushed Partygate off the front pages from Thursday, the prime minister is heading off for a high-profile trade trip to India this week. One minister said the sudden outburst of activity, particularly the Rwanda policy, bore the hallmarks of the Australian strategist Lynton Crosby, who has always remained close to Johnson. “I find it repugnant, but it’s just from that classic playbook,” they said. Johnson’s allies see the final threat as 9 May, when Russia could in theory end its attacks on Ukraine to coincide with the anniversary marking its defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. At that point, the invasion will no longer be a viable excuse for MPs refraining from calling on Johnson to go. Critics of the prime minister also know that even with the election likely to be two years away, their time to act is limited. Many have given themselves a summer deadline to decide whether to depose him. On Saturday night, the embattled Johnson issued his Easter message. “Easter tells us that there is light beyond the darkness,” he said. “That beyond the suffering lies redemption.” He will have to hope his gloomy MPs take his message as more than just a seasonal platitude.",News/Politics,"‘He’s still deep in the woods’ – as problems mount, MPs believe Boris Johnson’s premiership remains in great peril",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/17/hes-still-deep-in-the-woods-as-problems-mount-mps-believe-boris-johnsons-premiership-remains-in-great-peril
4/17/2022,"In the 1950s, a bestselling carpet – 2,000 miles of it – was produced by Kidderminster and was called “Skaters’ Trail”. It consisted of squiggly lines in vivid red and grey accompanied by a sprinkling of stars, replacing the brown linoleum and austerity floor coverings of wartime Britain and rationing. Open up any interior design magazine today, say Livingetc or House and Gardens – or browse on the website of Lulu “golden-wallpaper-at-£840-a-roll” Lytle – and the patterned carpet is very definitely back, apparently the choice of anyone under 50 who likes to be on trend. If, of course, they can first afford a roof over their heads. Those who learned to crawl on Skaters’ Trail are now well past 60, the target age for McCarthy Stone. Last year, the retirement property company provided “later living” for more than 20,000 people in 475 developments. If McCarthy Stone’s decor is similar to an expensive “later living” establishment that’s opened close to where I live, it will be achingly modern, a cruise ship riot of stripes, spots, glass, foliage, chandeliers and burnished gold. The ghost of Liberace at the piano is expected. McCarthy Stone’s website declares: “We want to provide a more positive view of what it means to be old.” This makes its study of the design tastes of those aged over 65, published last week, seem very rum indeed. The study peddles antiquated stereotypes before knocking them down with fresh research. According to those stereotypes, patterned carpets, floral wallpaper, avocado bathroom sets, garden gnomes, lace tablecloths, net curtains, grandfather clocks and china figurines are deemed “outdated” by two-thirds of pensioners. Of course they are – and, arguably, they were for many of their parents too. Those travelling through the unknown territory of later living today were raised in the kingdom of Habitat, launched in 1964, and Ikea, arriving in Warrington in the late 1980s; stripped back, flat-pack, bare floor boards, primary colours and white, white, white. In the 1960s, too, women began to move into paid work so the fewer objects to dust, polish, vacuum and dedicate your waking hours to, the better. More recently, many of that same generation have experienced the heart-splintering task of dismantling the households of a late mother or father or aunt. Yes, there is the occasional grandfather clock, garden gnome and china figurine – but these, too, have often been inherited from a previous generation. My late parents were, not untypically, teenagers serving in the forces during the second world war, and, like many of their generation, saw their family homes flattened by bombs. To throw away the possessions treasured by relatives, no matter how period, was deemed sacrilegious. Their offspring are often, reluctantly, more brutal. The furniture and sentimental objects mostly end up, sadly, in charity shops or condemned to the tip on grounds of health and safety. Having dismantled one or several households (with no avocado bathrooms and few “fluffy loo seat covers” but an awful lot of DIY), the mantra for many of my friends is, less is better. Not least because we don’t want to leave a legacy of “stuff”, whether ancient or uber-futuristic, so our own children have to go through the pain of discarding the reminders of a lifetime. In 2021, McCarthy Stone reported that 27% of over-65s in the UK say they have been subjected to ageism. Having grown up at a time when, at 20, anyone over 40 was regarded as an acquaintance of Noah and the Ark, that seems like progress. Not enough, but still progress. A further help would be to avoid daft stereotypes and to delve instead into the genuine scale of the huge diversity that represents older age today, moulded by affluence and poverty, health, geography and luck. And taste too, in all its manifestations. Meanwhile, back to Lulu Lytle’s website at interior design company Soane.

4/17/2022,"Doctors and nurses have spoken of feeling “brutalised” and burnt out, amid an escalating mental health crisis that has seen hospital staff take more than 8m days off sick in the past five years. Senior figures called for an urgent plan to plug staff shortages after data seen by the Observer revealed that sick leave related to mental health had increased each year since 2017, spiking through the pandemic. MPs warned that staff were at “breaking point”, and there was no clear plan to relieve the pressure on them. Some doctors warned of the lasting impact on their colleagues of having to deal with the pandemic. Intense pressure on staff is set to continue after it emerged last week that the number of people in England waiting to start routine hospital treatment had risen to the highest level since records began 15 years ago. Data from 67 NHS hospital trusts, released under the Freedom of Information Act, found that there had been the equivalent of 22,718 years of mental health sick days since 2017. More than 2.2m days came last year, as staff continued to battle through the pandemic, on top of huge treatment backlogs and overrun A&E departments. It is estimated that there are 110,000 vacancies across the NHS, with trust leaders repeatedly warning that there are no robust plans to ensure shortages are filled. Dr Thomas Dolphin, a consultant anaesthetist, said mental strains were most acute at the start of the pandemic, when staff struggled with limited PPE. However, he said the crisis exposed serious underlying problems. “There was the relentlessness of the banal horror of it – having to watch people dying in such horrible circumstances, unable to see their loved ones,” he said. “To be fair to the hospitals, there was a big focus on staff welfare. But it wasn’t enough, because this exposed understaffing in the NHS that’s been going on for a long, long time. “We brutalised our staff for months on end. Then, not surprisingly, quite a lot of them have left or retired, or moved to another country as soon as they could because it was soul-destroying. Now we’re in a position where we’re even more short staffed. The consequence is in those [mental health absence] numbers.” He said that allowing more staff to work reduced hours could help. Stephen Jones, professional lead for mental health at the Royal College of Nursing, said many nurses felt guilt at not being able to do more for patients. “Many are on the verge of leaving our profession for ever,” he said. “We want employers to work with us to make sure staff are rested, have breaks and look after themselves so they can look after patients better.” Miriam Deakin, director of policy and strategy at NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, said there remained an “enormous strain on people right across the health and care system”. She added: “Just 27% of people working in the NHS feel that there are enough staff in their organisation to allow them to do their jobs properly. More than half of ambulance workers said they felt unwell due to work-related stress in the last year. “Rising demand and persistent workforce shortages are leaving staff with unsustainably high workloads. As much as trust leaders work to ensure the wellbeing of their staff, supporting personal resilience while operating with these constraints can go only so far.” Daisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrats’ health spokesperson, who submitted the data requests, said that a host of improvements were needed to help staff, including dealing with the underlying problem of an overstretched workforce. “These staggering figures show the NHS is facing a tidal wave of mental health-related absences,” she said. “This must be a wake-up call to this Conservative government that they can’t turn a blind eye to this crisis any longer. Sajid Javid needs to come up with a clear plan to support NHS staff, starting by fixing chronic staffing shortages and reducing unsustainable workloads.” The data released by hospitals suggested the mental health problems were spread across the service, with the biggest trusts reporting the highest numbers of days lost. Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, one of England’s biggest, with 10 hospitals, recorded 591,254 working days lost to mental illness over the last five years. The Northern Care Alliance NHS Foundation Trust and Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, two other large trusts, recorded 555,798 and 401,417 sick days respectively. All three trusts said they had comprehensive mental health support for staff in place. A spokesperson for Manchester University NHS foundation trust said support included a comprehensive employee health and wellbeing service, a dedicated 24/7 employee assistance programme, online resources and mental health first aiders. Nicky Clarke, chief of people at the Northern Care Alliance NHS foundation trust, said staff had shown “remarkable resilience” throughout the pandemic, with a new wellbeing programme launched in 2020. Jenny Lewis of Leeds teaching hospitals NHS trust said not all mental health leave was work-related, and reiterated that large trusts had higher absence figures, adding: “We have done a lot of work with staff to remove the stigma associated with mental health so that we can better support our people.” A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: “We know the NHS has been under unprecedented pressure, and supporting the mental health and wellbeing of NHS staff is a priority. “We’ve invested £37m this year to fund 40 staff mental health hubs nationwide that sit alongside a dedicated helpline and 24/7 text support services.

Many residents have moved out of their apartment blocks and into houses in neighbouring villages, where they judge it will be safer. The few locals walking around behave as if they can’t hear the sirens blaring and appear not to flinch from the occasional thunder of incoming shells. Russia’s war in Ukraine is moving into a new phase centred on the Donbas region in the east, and most of its citizens are not taking any chances. Regional mayors told the Observer they estimated that about 70% of the population had left since Russia’s offensive began in February. Ukrainian-controlled Donbas is surrounded by Russian forces from the north, east and south. Ukraine’s authorities believe Russian forces are aiming to encircle the territory by cutting off their supply lines from the west. Russian-backed forces have held about a third of the region since 2014. Russia had hoped and possibly expected that its attempts to gain more territory would be popular with the mainly Russian-speaking population. But eight years of conflict, and particularly the last eight weeks, have taken their toll. “The number of people who support Russia has fallen dramatically,” said Oleksiy Yukov, the head of Black Tulips, a volunteer organisation that has been collecting and transferring bodies for people on both sides of the conflict line since 2014. Yukov said the Kramatorsk region had been relatively quiet. He had not seen a significant increase in the number of bodies since the full-out offensive in February. But he and his team have picked up more civilians. They collected 52 out of the 58 people who were killed when Kramatorsk railway station was hit by a Russian missile on 8 April. “But [pro-Russian views] still exist. There are people who don’t like Ukraine and can’t even explain why. Their explanations are empty of analysis,” said Yukov. “If someone is killed in front of their eyes for no reason, it doesn’t seem to change anything. They want to believe what they already believe and they don’t want to reassess. The propaganda is still getting through, and Ukraine didn’t do enough in these eight years to stop it.” But Kramatorsk’s mayor, Oleksandr Goncharenko, said the blockade of Mariupol in the Donetsk region and its disastrous humanitarian consequences had played a decisive role in changing people’s minds. “If in 2014, 60% of the town were pro-Russian, I would say now it’s around 15%,” he said. Goncharenko is one of the many Donbas politicians who has represented Ukraine’s pro-Russian parties. Goncharenko said his politics had changed after former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych “betrayed” Ukraine in 2014. He said there would be no “Donetsk people’s republic” in Kramatorsk and that he would take up arms if the city was occupied. In the neighbouring town of Slovyansk, just north of Kramatorsk and closer to the front lines, mayor Vadym Lyakh said he had received numerous phone calls and messages from the Russian side offering him property and safety for his family in exchange for switching sides. Lyakh said he had ignored them. The Russian side had not promised safety for Slovyansk residents, he said. As a local councillor, Lyakh had welcomed the Russian-backed separatist forces when they took over his city in 2014 and voted for the creation of the Donetsk people’s republic – something he was now reluctant to comment on. “I don’t think there’s a difference between Kramatorsk, Slovyansk and Kyiv. It’s all Ukraine and society won’t accept becoming part of Russia,” said Lyakh. He said that most people in Ukrainian-controlled Donbas saw that they had better lives under Ukrainian rule than in the Russian-backed republics created in 2014. He said: “But I can’t say that everyone has understood this. I can only say that more people have and that the military activities have further shrunk the number of people who are for the Russian world.” He said when he came to Slovyansk to study in 1995, there were no identity issues being discussed. “Back then we were all Ukrainian cities, there were no issues. Then in the 2000s, politicians started warring over us.” In the nearby town of Kreminna in the Luhansk region, next door to two frontline towns where battles between the two sides are reportedly continuing, dozens of people were packing their bags. “Most of the people here are waiting for Russian soldiers,” said Viktoria Slobodyansk, a 61-year-old retired English teacher who had volunteered for the Ukrainian army. “People only want to hear what they want to hear. They think if they were in Russia, they would live much better. That is why I decided to leave Kreminna. “I’m not afraid of the shelling,” she said, “but after Bucha and Hostomel, I’m afraid of Russian soldiers.”",News/World news,"‘After Bucha, I’m afraid of Russian soldiers’: people in east Ukraine prepare for fresh assault",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/17/after-bucha-im-afraid-of-russian-soldiers-people-in-east-ukraine-prepare-for-fresh-assault
4/17/2022,"Between 2008 and 2010, a child abuse ring that came to be known as part of the “grooming gang” phenomenon operated in Rochdale, Greater Manchester. Girls aged between 13 and 15 were trafficked, prostituted, raped and assaulted by the gang. One victim was forced to have sex with at least 20 men in one night; another was forced to drink vodka, and was vomiting over the side of the bed while being raped by “countless men”. The perpetrators would pass the girls to their friends, often to settle a debt. The victims, many of whom were from difficult backgrounds and therefore particularly vulnerable, were plied with drugs, alcohol and fast food, and then taken to “chill houses” across the north of England to be abused. One 13-year-old victim became pregnant and had an abortion. Some of the men involved were arrested, tried and found guilty. But not all. One of the victims – given the fictitious name Amber in Three Girls, the BBC One drama about the abuse – was 14 when she was targeted by gang members. After a troubled upbringing, Amber had been placed on the child protection register as being at risk of sexual and emotional abuse and neglect. Craving love and attention, Amber was lured into a nightmare, subjected to repeated and often violent sexual abuse. That nightmare should have ended with the arrest and trial of the perpetrators, but instead the police, Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and even social services treated her not as a victim but as a perpetrator. Last Tuesday Amber, with two other victims of the Rochdale grooming gang, finally received an apology delivered personally by Stephen Watson, the chief constable of Greater Manchester police (GMP). Their treatment encompasses a range of catastrophic errors in one of the country’s most harrowing child sexual abuse scandals. When we met in a hotel in Rochdale last month, Amber was accompanied by Maggie Oliver, a former police detective who walked out of the job in protest at the way Amber had been treated. In 2009, when Amber was 16, uniformed officers arrived at her mother’s house, arrested her and took her to the police station. “[I] can’t remember exactly what they said, but it was something along the lines of being a ‘madam’,” she recalled. “I didn’t know what that meant.” She was held in custody for hours before being released on bail. Her mother was not allowed to be with her during the interview, and there was no mention of an appropriate adult. Amber had, under pressure from the abusers, taken some of her friends to the takeaway where the ringleaders operated from. She told me: “It wasn’t like a forced thing. It was like a casual, ‘Oh, bring your friends.’” She was a vulnerable child, being sexually abused, controlled and in fear. No further action was taken against Amber, but it would be another two years before the CPS agreed that she should be treated as a victim and witness rather than a suspect. During that period, Amber – by now pregnant and living in a one-room flat – continued to be targeted by the grooming gangs. Although police interviewed a total of 56 men on suspicion of abuse, only a handful were tried. There were therefore many still walking free that had evaded detection. Amber was also threatened at gunpoint by a man whom she subsequently identified to the police. Nothing happened. She told me: “Police weren’t arsed with us, really. They weren’t bothered … when you’re from a shit home. They don’t give a fuck when you’re not from a wealthy background.” It was only when she met Oliver in early 2012 that things started to change. Oliver had been headhunted to join the grooming gangs case as detective and victim liaison officer in 2010 because of her experience working with vulnerable victims. Amber was understandably reluctant to trust the police. But once the CPS advised the GMP that she was no longer seen as a suspect, she was persuaded by Oliver to begin a series of video interviews and ID parades. I asked Amber what gave her the strength to give evidence to the police, after what she had gone through. She told me: “So it didn’t happen to anybody else. I didn’t want other people to feel how I felt.” Her courage and Oliver’s support resulted in a database of abusers whom she identified by names, car registrations, telephone numbers and addresses. It formed a large part of the police investigation that became known as Operation Span. The ID parades were particularly gruelling for Amber, who did 12 in one day alone, correctly identifying 10 of her abusers. Afterwards, she told me: “I went home, put it to the back of my mind to be honest. I’ve got a box in the back of my head, and I just put it all in there and it’s locked away.” But before what turned out to be the final interview, Oliver says she started to notice a change in tone from senior officers, and felt they were now deliberately trying to push this victim away. Then, shortly after the ID parade, Oliver was told that they were no longer going to “use” Amber’s evidence. She walked out, refusing to go along with this decision, and was forbidden from speaking to Amber. The period during the buildup to the trial of the men accused of being part of the grooming gang, was dark for Amber. She says she was never informed by police either that she was no longer being treated as a victim, or that none of those she alleged to be her abusers was to be prosecuted for her abuse. The trial of nine of the grooming gang was pending, and in the meantime, despite never having been informed, arrested or cautioned, Amber was added to the indictment by the CPS as a co-conspirator. Without Amber’s initial evidence there may never have been a trial at all. She gave the police a list, at an early stage of Operation Span, with nicknames, telephone numbers and other details relating to offenders. She later went on to positively identify a number of offenders, which enabled charges to be brought against them all. But in court, she was portrayed by the prosecution and defence as an assistant pimp. Because she was not involved in the trial, and therefore did not give evidence, she had no opportunity to defend herself. She was vilified and nicknamed in the press as the “Honey Monster”. Although a court order prevented her being named, everyone in her local community knew who she was. After the court case, social services started to pursue Amber, with the aim of having her children removed. Just before the due date of her second baby, she was called to the family court, where an application was made to remove both children on the grounds that Amber was an abuser and a danger to children. Finally, after a gruelling 18 months and several hearings, the judge threw the case out. Five years later she won an apology and compensation from social services. In 2019, Amber, along with two other victims, with the help of the Centre for Women’s Justice, issued a civil claim for damages against GMP and the director of public prosecutions (DPP). While GMP has finally settled the claim, which includes the personal apology from the chief constable, the DPP has so far resisted. In response to Amber’s claim that it was wrong to name her on the indictment, it says it was “both legally and tactically the correct course to take”. To date, the CPS has not accepted any failure on its part and instead continues to herald this case as the first successful prosecution of a grooming gang. While this is true, Amber believes that she was used as a scapegoat. “What the police and CPS did to me was worse than the abuse … The apology will be a kind of a weight lifted from me.” But the nightmare will never really be over. Amber still sees those whom she says raped, beat and tortured her, out and about in Rochdale. “One delivered a takeaway to my house a few weeks back,” she tells me. Finally, she has been exonerated. She has forced the police and social services to apologise to her for their behaviour. “I agreed to help the police to stop it happening to others,” Amber wrote to Oliver in the midst of her campaign for justice. “I trusted police … that I would be helped this time. I gave hours of interviews, reliving all the abuse. I felt sick, got upset … nothing never no one from police came to me to explain why I was no longer going to court. Not one charged never, why? “My name has been dragged through the mud. I push thoughts about the abuse out of my head. And I’ve done nothing wrong – I was a victim of these men at the age of 14. I should’ve been helped, not punished.” The NSPCC offers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

4/17/2022,"Labor says the appointment of Anne Ruston to the health portfolio in a re-elected Coalition government would mean cuts to Medicare, pointing to past comments by the senator that the costs of the health scheme were unsustainable. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced on Sunday that Ruston would take over the health and aged care ministry vacated by the retiring Greg Hunt, if the Coalition wins the election on 21 May. The opposition seized on the announcement, with leader Anthony Albanese saying Ruston “wants to take the universal out of universal healthcare”. Ruston, the families and social services minister, dismissed the remarks, telling a press conference on Sunday the Morrison government had been clear it would not cut Medicare. Labor pointed to remarks the senator made in parliament in March 2015 when the former Abbott government was attempting to make reforms to Medicare policy after abandoning plans for a co-payment. Ruston told the Senate “Medicare in its current form is not sustainable into the future without some change being made” and “we do need to seek some alternatives for how we are going to make Medicare sustainable into the future”. Earlier, in December 2014, she told the Senate: “Everybody would like to think that we could go on in life with universal healthcare, with universal education and with all these wonderful things that over the last 20 years Australians have come to accept as a given. Unfortunately, the credit card is maxed out.” Albanese said on Sunday Ruston “has made it very clear that, if we have [an] election of the Morrison government, we will see more cuts to Medicare, more cuts to Medicare over the next three years”. Labor’s Treasury spokesman Jim Chalmers said the appointment should “send a shiver down the spine of every Australian who relies on affordable healthcare”. But Ruston told media on Sunday Australia’s economy had come through the pandemic strongly and her current position was not reflected in remarks she made seven years ago. “Our government has been clear that we are not cutting Medicare,” she said. “Our track record in terms of increased spending across all elements of our healthcare system stand for themselves.” Morrison said the senator was the right pick to guide Australia’s health system out of the pandemic because of her experience managing the complex portfolio of families and social services. He defended his government’s record on health spending. “If people want to understand what are the consequences of a government that can’t manage money, like the Labor party … what are the consequences of that?” he said. “Well the consequences are not being able to put pharmaceuticals on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme.” Earlier on Sunday, the Coalition announced it would subsidise continuous glucose monitoring devices for all people with type 1 diabetes. Currently the devices are subsidised for some people including pregnant women, people under the age of 21 and concession cardholders. “Our plan for a strong economy means we can invest in life-changing equipment for diabetes patients and make more medicines cheaper for more Australians,” Morrison said. Labor said it would match the announcement, with health and ageing spokesman Mark Butler saying Australia had “a proud history of bipartisan support for new diabetes technologies”. “Whatever the election result, Australians with type 1 diabetes will get better support,” he said.",News/Australia news,Anne Ruston defends past comments that Medicare ‘is not sustainable’ after PM names her as health minister if re-elected,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/17/anne-ruston-defends-past-comments-that-medicare-is-not-sustainable-after-pm-names-her-as-health-minister-if-re-elected
4/17/2022,"An extensive collection of Francis Bacon’s art will be given to France instead of to the Tate following a row between the gallery and one of the artist’s closest friends. Barry Joule, who was Bacon’s confidant, said he is so frustrated by the Tate’s failure to exhibit an earlier donation of the artist’s work that he has cancelled plans to donate hundreds more items to the gallery. The further donation was to have included up to 150 drawings, 10 paintings, hundreds of photographs and more than 12 hours of taped material in which the artist chatted with Joule about subjects from art to sex. Instead, he would now like the work to go the French National Archives in the Centre Pompidou Paris, and has started negotiations. Joule told the Observer: “The Tate and Britain will be missing out on part of the nation’s art history of one of their most important painters. I turn my back on the Tate for ever.” In 2004, he gave the Tate about 1,200 sketches, photographs and documents from Bacon’s studio in what was then described as one of the most generous gifts to the gallery, worth an estimated £20m. Its announcement stated then: “Tate will undertake to study, photograph and catalogue the collection over the next three years, before displaying these items and making them available for loan.” Joule claims he has been driven to pursue legal action against the Tate over what he describes as its failure to do justice to that collection with a proper exhibition, as initially agreed, although the Tate’s director, Maria Balshaw, wrote to him last year, reiterating the gallery’s gratitude. He has now told the Tate they won’t receive a further gift. “The gallery’s reaction? Nothing,” he said. Joule had lived near Bacon’s London studio, and in 1978 they struck up a friendship that continued until the artist’s death in 1992, exactly 30 years ago this month. He spent numerous holidays with Bacon and recorded a series of their conversations: “He [Bacon] signed a statement saying I could use it 12 years after his death. Many of those conversations feature him philosophising, often with his unmistakable no-nonsense comments,” he said. He singled out a 1991 recording that gives insights into Bacon’s dismissal of his own success. At one point, he shouts the words “I am not rich!” – even though he was by then the most famous and richest painter alive. Joule said: “He was a self-deprecating artist who, strangely enough, never ever thought of himself as rich. Of course, he was rich, but he lived very simply. The only time he really splashed out was in expensive restaurants.” In those recordings, Bacon talked about other artists, including Jasper Johns, dismissing his 1959 abstract painting, False Start – which had sold in 1988 for $17m (£12m) – as “such a ridiculous thing”: “It is nothing. It is just a … number of diagonal scratches going in different directions in red and blue,” Bacon said. Joule, who now lives in France, noted Bacon’s love of Paris, although “he said he couldn’t work there because there were too many distractions”. He previously donated about 100 Bacon drawings based on Picasso to the Musée Picasso in Paris, which exhibited them in a large Bacon-Picasso exhibition in 2005. Shortly afterwards, the French government awarded him the Chevalier des Ordres des Arts et des Lettres: “It’s the equivalent of a knighthood. I gave them one-tenth of what I gave to the Tate and they knighted me … I never got a cup of coffee out of the Tate.” Joule’s donation to France will now include a dramatic painted head that musician David Bowie particularly liked: “Bowie had an art publishing company and personally chose what art catalogues they would publish. He immediately agreed to do the catalogue for the 2001 exhibition of my Bacon archive at the London Barbican. Bowie chose this image for the front cover. Of course the Barbican and I agreed,” he said. He added: “Many of these Bacon images in my collection have an engaging story to tell. That art history and my intimate knowledge of Bacon will be lost to the UK.” A Tate spokeswoman declined to comment on the gallery’s handling of the 2004 gift. Asked about Joule’s cancellation of a further gift, she said: “We can confirm we have received the letter and will be responding to it.”",Arts/Art and design,Friend of Francis Bacon snubs the Tate to give art works to Paris instead,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/17/friend-of-francis-bacon-snubs-the-tate-to-give-art-works-to-paris-instead

4/17/2022,"Joe Biden says Vladimir Putin’s Russia is committing genocide in Ukraine. Lawyers may differ, but he’s probably right. So will the US intervene to stop it? Sadly, no. Kyiv badly needs fighter jets and, for example, M1 Abrams main battle tanks to halt the atrocities. Will it get them? No, again. What Ukraine gets far too much of is gesture politics. If and when all its people are dead or uprooted, Biden can say: “I told you so.” This will be no great consolation. The gulf between what western leaders provide and what Ukraine actually requires to survive grows potentially fatal as a huge Russian offensive looms in the east. Russia’s defeat around Kyiv was epic. So, too, is the sinking of the Moskva battle cruiser. But such victories may create a misleading impression about the overall direction of the war. Even Russian generals, if they stay alive, learn from their mistakes. Ukraine’s darkest hour may just be beginning. Western democracies, grouped around Nato, have done a great deal to help, but not nearly enough. The problem starts with the US, the alliance leader, and it’s a familiar one. Polls suggest most Americans support Ukraine but don’t want US forces directly involved. That’s Biden’s personal instinct, too. A war in Europe looks very different when viewed from Paris, Texas than from Paris, France. It lacks that certain existential edge. Direct, limited Nato military intervention on the ground to create safe havens in western Ukraine, for example, or to target in-theatre artillery, naval and missile forces that bomb civilians, is entirely feasible. The mere threat might give Russia pause. Yet Biden will not hear of it. His fear that it would automatically escalate into all-out Nato-Russia warfare is almost certainly unfounded. Putin knows he would lose such a fight. But who dares put it to the test? That leaves two options: arms and sanctions. But here, too, the west still dithers. When Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s president, appeals, as he does daily, for an immediate embargo on Russian oil, gas and coal exports, he again runs up against a mix of western caution, indecision and self-interest. The EU, for example, is haggling endlessly over a possible oil ban. Yet without such measures, Ukraine’s life chances will greatly diminish over time. The US, like Britain, is expanding the range and quality of the “defensive” weaponry it supplies. Biden’s latest $800m package includes helicopters, armoured personnel carriers, radars and drones. The Pentagon has asked the US military’s eight largest defence contractors to help find ways to arm Ukraine faster and better. This, incidentally, represents a de facto western escalation to which Putin has now formally objected. Perhaps Russian use of chemical or biological weapons will be the step that triggers a war-changing US response. Majorities of Americans say they would back military action if such illegal weapons are used or if a Nato ally is attacked. The White House, which says it is readying “proportional” non-military retaliatory options, evidently lags behind public opinion. All western governments will ultimately be to blame if Ukraine falls or is partitioned east from west, like Germany in 1945. Britain’s Boris Johnson has accumulated much kudos as Zelenskiy’s self-appointed new best friend. Yet while the UK has provided seriously effective anti-tank weapons, it dutifully toes Washington’s line on planes, tanks and ground troops. Johnson, hamming it up as the British lion in Kyiv last weekend, claimed “Putin’s monstrous aims are being thwarted … We are convening a global alliance to bring this tragedy to an end.” This is plainly untrue. Half the world, including China and India, is unsupportive. And the end is not nearly in sight – which an honest man would admit. Each day more crimes are committed. And the loathsome Putin waxes cocky about his “noble” war. Germany, Europe’s supposed leader, is another sorry case. Chancellor Olaf Scholz says those who perpetrated atrocities in the town of Bucha “must be held accountable”. But that day of reckoning remains a distant dream as long as Scholz continues to reject national and EU-wide energy sanctions and argue over arms supplies. “I don’t understand how anyone in Germany can sleep at night,” said Andriy Melnyk, Ukraine’s ambassador to Berlin. “What does it take for Germany to act?” The crisis has shed uncomfortable light on lucrative links between German big business and Putin’s Kremlin kleptocracy. Bilateral trade totalled €60bn (£50bn) last year. Now the ruling coalition is divided over how far Zeitenwende – Scholz’s term for the historic watershed facing Germany – should go. While a whacking €100bn defence spending increase is promised to protect Germans, Scholz is delaying delivery of a few heavy weapons to protect Ukrainians. The smaller the European nation, the bigger its contribution, or so it often seems. Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have all stepped up boldly, as have Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland. They fear they could be next. Now anxious Finland and Sweden are aiming to join Nato. Having managed without its help throughout the first cold war, they’re just in time for the second. Ukraine’s forces will doubtless fight valiantly in the coming battle for the east. But by some estimates they will be outnumbered five to one. Casualties will inevitably be high, while perhaps the best outcome they can hope for is stalemate. And yet, as this horror unfolds, US-led Nato, the world’s most powerful military alliance, will sit on its hands, apparently prepared, if need be, to watch Ukraine dismembered bit by gruesome bit. Without increased support, Zelenskiy predicts an “endless bloodbath”. Western leaders should talk less and do more – and if all else fails, be ready to intervene militarily.",Opinion/Opinion,"Nato should talk less and do more, or Ukraine will be torn apart, bit by bit",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/17/nato-should-talk-less-and-do-more-or-ukraine-will-be-torn-apart-bit-by-bit
4/17/2022,"‘ABritish horror story” is the subtitle of Netflix’s two-part documentary on Jimmy Savile, released a couple of weeks ago. And what a horror story it is, recounting how Savile, one of Britain’s most notorious sex offenders, used his BBC stardom and NHS fundraising to abuse children as young as eight over the course of four decades. As appalling as the crimes themselves is the number of adults who paid little heed to the rumours of paedophilia that swirled around Savile, and the institutions, from the BBC to the NHS to local councils, that failed to act. At Stoke Mandeville hospital, nurses said they would tell children to pretend they were asleep as Savile roamed the wards looking for victims. Savile even made a habit of alluding to his crimes in public. This is the story of every child sexual abuse scandal that has afflicted this country and there are so many that the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse has been running for seven years and counting. It is never just a tale of the sick people who abuse children, but of those around them who enable them, and the institutions that turn a blind eye. From the church, to football clubs, to residential schools, to the care system, to the heart of Westminster, sex offenders have been able to harm children with impunity because other people choose not to look too hard, or to defend them in the face of damning evidence. This is hardly a relic of history. Today, we have safeguarding laws and policies designed to protect children that simply didn’t exist a few decades ago. Yet none of it is failsafe: they rely on adults in authority being willing to enforce them. The latest reminder of this came just last week, when the Conservative MP Crispin Blunt made a public statement defending his fellow parliamentarian Imran Ahmad Khan after he was convicted of child sexual assault. A jury found that Khan had plied a 15-year-old boy with gin, took him upstairs to watch pornography and groped him in a bunk bed, leaving him “inconsolable” and “shaking”. Another person alleged that Khan assaulted them as a young man. Khan has now resigned as an MP. No matter to Blunt, who released a statement saying that he was “distraught at the dreadful miscarriage of justice”, calling Khan’s conviction an “international scandal” that relied on “lazy tropes about LGBT+ people”, with implications for “millions of LGBT+ Muslims around the world”. (Blunt claimed to have sat in on some of the trial, but reporters say he was not there to hear the victim or his family give evidence.) He told his Conservative association that the crime of which Khan had been convicted was “minor on any scale”. Blunt has now retracted his statement, offered a mealy-mouthed apology and resigned as chair from the all-party parliamentary group on global LGBT rights. Blunt’s behaviour is corrosive to preventing child sexual abuse. One of the many reasons it is so hard for children to disclose their abuse is that set against the denials of the powerful men who abuse them – whether their power derives from family structures, a position of authority or celebrity status – they think they will never be believed. One journalist reveals in the documentary that a woman abused by Savile as a 13-year-old asked him: “Who’d take our word against the word of someone so famous and establishment he’s even close friends with the royals?” How right she was: the story didn’t run and after the BBC pulled an investigation into Savile a few weeks after his death, he was feted for months. What message does Blunt’s public statement send to the young man Khan has been convicted of assaulting and to other children being abused across the country? By implying that Khan’s conviction is unsafe because it was powered by “lazy tropes”, Blunt is echoing the cloak of untouchability that the men who abuse children so often try to construct around themselves. It is of course true that false claims of paedophilia have been – and still are – deployed as homophobic slurs against gay men. And that convictions of Muslim men of Asian origin of grooming and sexually abusing young girls in towns such as Rotherham and Rochdale, which show only that men of all colours and faiths are capable of raping children, have wrongly been used to imply that Muslim or Asian men are more likely to abuse children. But it is also true that some child sexual abuse offenders trade off these forms of bigotry as a cover for their crimes. White or black, gay or straight, rich or poor: abusers come in all shapes and sizes. The only thing they have in common is that they are almost always male. And they often excel at dismissing any allegations that surface against them – Savile referred to “weirdo letters”. Sometimes, they hide behind institutions that lend them a veneer of morality – church or charity. Sometimes, they say that people are out to get them because of their skin colour or their sexuality. Either way, the implicit warning is: to mess with us is to mess with the greater good. Blunt was condemned by some of the other MPs on the parliamentary group, who resigned in protest at his statement. Where, though, was the statement from the prime minister, condemning Blunt’s words and making clear that it is never, ever acceptable for someone in a position of authority to minimise child sexual abuse? Where was the sanction from the Conservative party? Where is the investigation into why it has no record of the call Khan’s victim made to alert them that he had a decade earlier reported his sexual assault to the police? I hate the notion that Savile “groomed a nation”, a phrase coined by the Met commander who led the Savile investigation. It lets off the hook too many adults who should have protected those children. That an MP can today engage in paedophile apologia with only the mildest consequences shows how very far Britain still is from learning the lessons of Jimmy Savile.

4/17/2022,"Two-time world champion Tyler Wright has made it third time lucky at Bells Beach after busting through the pain barrier to finally win the iconic World Surf League event. Wright lost the Bells Beach final to Carissa Moore in both 2013 and 2014 but the 28-year-old Australian got her revenge on Sunday, beating Moore 16.93 to 10.57 in a dominant performance that featured rides of 8.93 and 8.00. Wright was brimming with joy as she caught a wave in to celebrate the win, and was chaired out of the ocean by her brothers Owen and Mikey Wright. “Honestly this is a dream come true,” Wright told the WSL broadcast. “There’s been so many times I wanted to give up on getting back to this sort of form. It’s taken all of me. It’s unbelievable.” Sunday’s Rip Curl Pro victory was her first title on the World Surf League tour since the Maui Pro at Pipeline in 2021. “I cannot put into words what this means,” she said. “It’s more than a win. It’s the only event I’ve ever wanted to win. I’m over the moon, I’m stoked. “Two years being out is a long time. That fire that kind of got snuffed out by illness has been re-lit. “It’s been a long time since I’ve felt like I’ve surfed like myself.” Just making it to the final was no easy feat for Wright. She edged past three-time Bells winner Courtney Conlogue 14.23 to 13.90 in a tense semi-final showdown. Wright trailed Conlogue with seven minutes remaining in the heat, needing a 7.01 ride to retake the lead. The Australian produced the goods when it mattered most, attacking a wave with intensity to secure a 7.33. But the effort required to claw her way back took its toll on Wright, who was left in pain and needed to take some time out after the heat to recuperate. Wright missed half of 2018 and almost all of 2019 after being struck down by an illness that was later diagnosed as post-viral syndrome, and she is aware that pushing her body too hard can take its toll. “I call it the edge. It’s essentially when my heart rate and my fight or flight gets so peaked so quickly,” Wright said. “Essentially my ovaries start to cramp up and everything in me is just pain. “That heart-rate spike was pretty hectic [today] due to how I had to surf back into the heat. At the end there my ovaries there were pretty killer, and I had to take a minute to walk it out for sure. Wright thanked the people who supported her through her health challenges. “I feel incredibly lucky for everyone that I have around me and also the people that have helped me work this hard to get back,” she said. “It’s not easy to rebuild after two years out of the water. Building back takes a lot of patience and a lot of trust and rebuilding trust in myself to manage this sort of stuff again.” Meanwhile, Ethan Ewing’s hopes of emulating his mother by winning Bells Beach were cruelly denied by Brazilian Filipe Toledo. Ewing, whose late mother Helen Lambert won the 1983 Bells Beach title, soared into the semi-finals after posting an impressive quarter-final win over Olympic bronze medallist Owen Wright on Saturday. But his 35-minute semi-final against Toledo on Sunday was blighted by a lack of surfable waves. Ewing’s first scoring wave did not come until there was just six minutes remaining and it was too small to do any major damage. Toledo went on to defeat another Australian, rookie Callum Robson, in the final and heads to the Margaret River Pro as the new world No 1.",Sport/Sport,‘It’s taken all of me’: Australian surfer Tyler Wright wins at Bells Beach,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/17/its-taken-all-of-me-australian-surfer-tyler-wright-wins-at-bells-beach
