5/17/2022,"The north-east of England has gained a “northern research powerhouse” to rival anything outside London, according to the vice-chancellor of the University of Northumbria after his institution rocketed up national research rankings. Andrew Wathey took over at the Newcastle university in 2008 when it was 81st for research output, and has now seen it vault into 28th place in the UK, according to results of the research excellence framework (Ref) published this month. The two-year-long exercise, which reviewed and rated the output of 76,000 academics across the UK, is vital for dividing up £2bn a year in government research grants, and could mean millions more for high-flyers such as Northumbria. Wathey said his institution’s performance in the Ref was “a great testament to what colleagues have achieved” and offered big rewards for the region as a whole. “There are important consequences for the north-east here. This in effect gives Newcastle a second research-intensive university. And if you add Durham, it makes the biggest concentration of researchers in any city area outside London,” Wathey said. With Newcastle University in 17th place and Durham 21st out of the 157 UK institutions that took part in the Ref, the trio combined have nearly 3,500 active research staff – more than the likes of Cambridge or Oxford. For the north-east’s local authorities, universities play a vital role, Wathey said. “In the north-east there aren’t many FTSE-100 companies, so for local authorities universities are really the only other corporations with which they can work on place-shaping. “Levelling up is not a new idea but this plays into that, this is how you do regional development. And the local authorities in the north-east have got a very enlightened view towards universities and research, which is that it will drive future economic growth in the region.” Wathey said there was no magic behind Northumbria’s rise, other than picking a strategy that firmly emphasised research and sticking to it. In practical terms, Wathey said, that meant making sure the university’s vacancies were filled with academics “who are both inspirational teachers and excellent researchers”, as well as reducing bureaucracy and refocusing the institution. “We worked hard on culture and leadership. And we recognised the workload of research,” Wathey said. Because the Ref is based on individuals’ research output, ambitious institutions have been eager to appoint staff with established “Ref-able” credentials. But Wathey said Northumbria had been able to attract talented academics right at the start of their careers, which has paid dividends. “We created posts which we called vice-chancellor’s research fellows. Unlike quite a lot of the postdoc positions around the sector, these have had a guaranteed follow-on into lecturer posts. And they proved to be very popular, with some of our stars of today joining us early on in those posts.” The figures from the latest Ref show how successful that strategy has been: in the results of the 2008 exercise, Northumbria had just 56 staff judged to be producing world-leading or internationally excellent research. By 2014’s Ref that had risen to 207, and the total this year has swelled to 840, in subjects as diverse as English and history and engineering. The Ref success of Northumbria, and others such as Manchester Metropolitan, suggest that for the first time modern universities are crossing “the clear blue water”, in Wathey’s phrase, that has previously separated the newer institutions from their more established counterparts. Under the government’s current method of allocating research funding – based on the 2014 Ref – the Russell Group of universities would lose around £44m a year. But the allocations based on the 2021 Ref have yet to be set – and the established research universities are likely to argue that they shouldn’t lose out. Sarah Richardson, the editor of Research Professional News, which tracks funding, said its Ref analysis found that the “golden triangle” formed by the universities of Oxford, Cambridge and London had seen a fall in its share of highly rated research. “I think this does suggest that while the golden triangle is clearly dominant in research, the gap with the rest of the country might be slightly narrower than previously thought. That’s really important when you think about levelling up, the government’s agenda is to increase the spread of research across around the country. So there’s lots of concern in the sector about how that might impact the golden triangle,” Richardson said. For Wathey, the amount of income directly generated is less important than the potential boost in public perception of universities such as Northumbria. “The reputational gain is more important than money. The money is nice but there are relatively fewer ways in which you can build reputational gain. And this is a really key one.”",News/Education,‘Northern powerhouse’: Northumbria University climbs research rankings,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/17/northern-powerhouse-northumbria-university-climbs-research-rankings
5/17/2022,"Elon Musk has said his $44bn (£35bn) planned takeover of Twitter cannot progress until the microblogging platform proves that fewer than 5% of its users are fake or spam accounts. There is a strong chance the world’s richest person could try to walk away from the deal or to negotiate a lower price than the agreed $54.20 a share. This raises questions about what actions Musk can take under the terms of the deal he signed last month with Twitter, which experts say gives the Tesla chief executive limited room for manoeuvre. Yes it is, and it is very detailed. For all the talk from Musk of putting the deal on hold or negotiating a lower price, he has committed himself to the takeover at $54.20 a share by signing a formal agreement. It is going to be difficult to wriggle out of it. As section 6.3 (a) states: “The parties hereto will use their respective reasonable best efforts to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this agreement.” It is a standard clause, according to Brian Quinn, an associate professor at Boston College law school, but has bite. “In all contracts, there is an implied obligation of good faith and fair dealing. Musk agrees to use his ‘reasonable best efforts’ to get the deal done. He can’t torpedo the deal by simply refusing to continue,” Quinn said. Musk indicated on Monday that his concerns about fake or spam accounts on Twitter – that the actual numbers are higher than Twitter estimates – could constitute a “material adverse misstatement”, if it emerges that the platform’s fake or bot accounts amount to far more than 5% of its 229 million user base. Musk could argue that, if it transpires Twitter has much higher-than-expected fake or spam account numbers, it constitutes a “material adverse effect” and he should be allowed to walk away from the agreement. However, the adverse effect clause is difficult to get past a court. In one exceptional case in the state of Delaware – the jurisdiction of the Twitter deal – a judge allowed a company to scrap a deal because a whistleblower revealed fraud at the selling business. But Musk is on much trickier ground. Twitter has flagged the 5% figure in its quarterly results for the past eight years, with the caveat that the true number could be higher. Musk knew what he was signing up for, Quinn said. “Bots are a well-known problem on Twitter. Musk even pointed to getting rid of bots as one way his ownership would add value to the business. Now, he is apparently shocked that there are bots on the platform? It’s a weak pretext with no legal legs. “Also, Twitter’s disclosure to the US Securities and Exchange Commission with regard to bots is sufficiently hedged that a buyer should reasonably know that it might be higher than 5%.” No, but there is a scenario where one could be negotiated. If Musk were to walk away Twitter would probably hold his feet to the fire, suing him in Delaware under the terms of the deal. As the litigation rolls on both parties could seek to negotiate a new price. However, in a strictly legal sense, Musk’s hand is not strong. Again, no. The deal agreement not only includes a $1bn break fee if Musk does quit, but Twitter can also enact a clause that could force Musk to complete the deal at $54.20 a share. Section 9.9 of the agreement entitles Twitter to “specific performance”, whereby Musk has to pay up if he still has the debt-financing in place and Twitter still wants to close the deal. Twitter is in control here, Quinn said. “The remedy – a termination fee or specific performance is at the election of the company, not Musk,” he said. Twitter, for its part, remains committed despite Musk’s behaviour. In a statement on Tuesday it said: “Twitter is committed to completing the transaction on the agreed price and terms as promptly as practicable.”",News/Technology,What are Elon Musk’s options in the Twitter takeover deal?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/17/what-are-elon-musk-options-in-the-twitter-takeover-deal
5/17/2022,"Karim Aïnouz, best known for mostly Brazil-set dramatic features such as Invisible Life, Love for Sale and the evocatively titled I Travel Because I Have to, I Come Back Because I Love You, is truly an international film-maker. The son of a Brazilian mother and an Algerian father, he lives sometimes in Berlin and sometimes in the US, depending on his latest project. (His next film, Firebrand, will star Alicia Vikander as Henry VIII’s last wife Katherine Parr.) Mariner of the Mountains, which premiered last year at Cannes, goes back to basics technically and Aïnouz’s own family history to create a thoughtful, often moving essay film about his journey to Algeria, the fatherland he never knew. Narrated throughout in Portuguese by the silky-voiced director, the film comprises a sort of filial love letter to his recently deceased mother, Iracema, who brought him up in Fortaleza, northern Brazil, with his grandmother after she was separated from her husband, Majid, Karim’s Algerian father. Majid went to Algeria to fight in the civil war, leaving his wife pregnant back in the Americas. In the film, Aïnouz meets disaffected youth smoking blunts by the waterside, kindly old folk who offer him coffee and oral history, a bright teenage cousin who reels off local creation myths, and an especially beautiful goat with curly wurly horns. The imagery mixes the scenic footage Aïnouz shot himself along the way, intermingled with old Super 8 footage of Iracema as a young woman, archive footage and bewitching microscope views of the single-celled sea creatures the director’s mother studied as a scientist. Adding the film’s dreamy vibe is the editing by Ricardo Saraiva, which repeatedly builds up an atmosphere in a montage with some lovely music bedded under it only to abruptly cut, killing the buzz each time. It’s as if the film wants to keep pulling the rug out from under us, just when we might be thinking we’re in for a bit of brainy cinematic tourism. But Aïnouz is no sentimentalist; his essay invokes not just the mysteries of his parents’ marriage but the country’s postcolonial history and anguished present, a subject that he explored further in Nardjes A, a companion piece to this that he shot concurrently and follows a local activist fighting for democracy.

5/17/2022,"The co-founder and chief executive of Airbnb, Brian Chesky, has donated $100m to Barack Obama’s foundation to fund scholarships for students pursuing careers in public service, with the awards including multiple stipends for travel. Each so-called Voyager scholarship will grant $50,000 to rising college juniors to cover tuition costs over two years as well as a $10,000 grant and Airbnb credit to fund a summer academic trip designed by the student. Scholarship winners will also receive an Airbnb credit worth $2,000 a year for 10 years after their graduation, which is on top of Chesky’s donation, a foundation spokesperson said. “If we want this next generation of leaders to be able to do what they need to do, they have to meet each other. They have to know each other. They have to understand each other’s communities,” Obama said in a video announcement. “You’re going to find young people from every corner of this country who are going to be future change makers. There are leaders everywhere. We just have to find them,” he added. Obama and Chesky plan to meet with scholarship recipients at an annual conference to talk about service and leadership. “There are young people across the country who have a passion for public service, but can’t pursue it because of their student loan debt,” Chesky said. “We want to help reduce that burden.” Chesky’s donation is one of the two largest the Obama Foundation has ever received, tied with a $100m donation from the Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos, in November. About 43 million Americans carry student loans worth $1.6tn, according to federal figures. Joe Biden promised to cancel $10,000 in federal student debt per person while campaigning, but has not yet done so. He said in April that he was continuing to study what action to take on student loans. The Voyager scholarship has opened applications via the website Scholarship America for the first 100 students it will fund. Applicants must be entering their junior year of college at a four-year US university and must be an American citizen, permanent resident or have a deferred action status under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program. The deadline to apply is 14 June. Scholarship America is managing the application process, but the Obama Foundation will select recipients, a spokesperson for the foundation said. Students must demonstrate a commitment to public service, which the program’s website defines broadly as “careers in government, nonprofits or the private sector”, including occupations ranging “from community organizing to social work and from entrepreneurship to the arts”. The Obama Foundation has recently funded community organizations working to close opportunity gaps for boys and young men of color as well as to fund girls’ education, according to its 2020 tax filings. “Education is personal for me,” said Michelle Obama, the former first lady. “I’ve met so many young people who are interested in public service, but they’re wondering how they’re going to pay for school or whether they’ll get to see the world beyond their own community.”",News/US news,Airbnb chief donates $100m to Obama scholarship fund,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/17/airbnb-chief-brian-chesky-obama-donation
5/17/2022,"The Democrats have no plan. On Wednesday, just over a week after Politico published a leaked draft of Justice Samuel Alito’s forthcoming majority opinion in Dobbs v Jackson, which will overrule Roe v Wade later next month, the Senate did the only thing they could think to do: they voted on the Women’s Health Protection Act, a bill to codify a federal right to abortion. The bill had already been brought to a vote this past February – before the leak of the opinion, but long after it became clear that the supreme court would end the abortion right – and it had already failed. On Wednesday, it failed again, by 49 votes to 51, on party lines: only one Democrat, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, sided with the unanimous Republicans in denying women a federally recognized right to make their own decisions for their health and lives. This was no surprise: bringing the act to a vote was a mere symbolic gesture. Democratic women senators and their staff had walked to the floor for the vote chanting “My body, my decision.” But ultimately, they weren’t powerful enough to get it passed. They didn’t have the votes. What’s next in the Democrats’ fight to preserve abortion rights? Evidently, not much. After the WHPA failed, Vice-President Kamala Harris told ABC News that Americans’ best chance to protect their sovereignty over their own bodies to was to vote more, and vote harder. “A priority for all who care about this issue should be to elect pro-choice leaders at the local, the state and the federal level.” It was a shrugging admission of defeat, and the administration has consistently passed the buck. “It will fall on voters to elect pro-choice officials in November,” Biden himself said in a Wednesday statement. The responsibility for securing this essential right, the administration seems to say, lies with voters – not with them. For her part, Harris also added that the Senate majority’s vote did not reflect most Americans’ feelings about abortion rights. But then again, the Senate majority does not represent most Americans at all: the 49 senators who voted in favor of abortion rights represent tens of millions more people than the 51 senators who voted against them. And here lies a legitimate conundrum for the Democratic leadership: their voters are enraged and scared by the Dobbs opinion, and by the coming end of legal abortion in an estimated 26-28 states. But the party leadership insists they cannot intervene, claiming that there is relatively little that can be done to stop, slow or mitigate this coming legal and humanitarian disaster. It is part of the rot of our political system that, like the electoral college, our legislatures have been manipulated by gerrymandering and malapportionment to ensure that Republicans can get fewer votes from the people and yet control more seats in the Capitol – and Democrats must not just win the popular vote, but win it by impossibly large margins to have any power at all. Republican victories are increasingly inevitable, even as the majority of voters move away from the party’s rapid extremism, and Democratic victories are largely toothless even as they become more and more difficult to achieve. This is a real structural obstacle the Democrats face, and one that is incompatible with continuing American democracy. It threatens to enshrine permanent Republican minority rule. And yet it is more than a little frustrating that the Democratic leadership, who after all do control both Congress and the White House, appear to be so wholly unprepared for the fall of Roe, and even surprised by the Alito opinion. “We will be ready when any ruling is issued,” Biden said in a statement after the opinion became public, perhaps accidentally betraying that he is decidedly not ready now. Reporting from the Washington Post shows the White House in an apparent state of confusion and chaos in the days since the draft leak, scrambling for ways to respond. “The leaked document caught the White House off guard,” the Post reports. Really? It should not have. The reversal of Roe has been the decades-long, publicly stated, and passionately pursued goal of the Republican right. The conservative legal movement has spent years cultivating young jurists with the express purpose of deploying them to deny reproductive rights. Members of the supreme court have made it abundantly clear that they would consider ending women’s bodily sovereignty to be the pinnacle of their careers. Feminist and abortion rights activists, not to mention women’s healthcare providers, have been sounding the alarm for just as long, pleading for help from Democratic officials as increasingly draconian and labyrinthine abortion restrictions have made the procedure harder and more expensive to access. At clinics across the country every Saturday for decades, protesters appear to scream at patients and providers alike that they are murderers. These anti-choice zealots have waged a years-long campaign of terrorism, stalking providers, putting photos of patients online and committing arsons, bombings, invasions and assassinations. Abortion has already been illegal after six weeks – and Roe effectively moot – in Texas since September of last year. And yet the White House says it was “caught off guard”? I know some abortion providers who would envy the luxury of that ignorance. Not only has the problem long been obvious, but so have many of the solutions. For months, human rights activists and legal experts have been pleading with the Biden administration to take aggressive action to protect abortion within its own authority – for while the legislative avenue to codifying women’s rights seems foreclosed, the Democrats still control the expansive authority of the executive branch. Biden could instruct the FDA to loosen its uniquely onerous and medically unnecessary restrictions on abortion medication. He could lease federal lands and buildings in red states to abortion providers, creating islands of access inside the vast stretches of the American landscape where abortion will soon be illegal. His administration can sue to block state restrictions on abortion medication that are more stringent than the FDA’s rules, citing federal supremacy. They could make a more aggressive push for Congress to end the Hyde Amendment, a budget rider that bans federal funds from covering abortion care. Or they could circumvent it, by paying for women’s transportation to legal-care states. As abortion becomes not just illegal, but criminal, the administration can direct the Department of Health and Human Services to step in to protect patients from being reported to law enforcement and prosecuted. According to Emma Roth, an attorney with the advocacy group National Advocates for Pregnant Women, the HHS has this authority both under HIPAA’s privacy protections, and under section 1557, a federal regulation preventing sex discrimination in healthcare. But the administration hasn’t done any of this. They don’t seem interested in trying. Maybe it’s because any move to secure abortion access will be challenged in hostile federal courts – though the possibility of lawsuits has never deterred the anti-choice side. Or maybe it’s because of embarrassment or disdain for abortion within the Democratic party, coupled with their historic unwillingness to prioritize feminist issues. After all, during the primaries, Biden was the only candidate who supported the Hyde Amendment. And while Democratic leaders admonish abortion supporters to vote, they are also backing Henry Cuellar, an anti-choice Texas Democrat, in his primary opposite the young pro-choice progressive Jessica Cisneros. After the draft opinion leaked, the White House had no strategy for abortion rights, but they did find time to scold frightened pro-choice voters who protested in ways that Biden apparently found indecorous. The administration isn’t wrong that those of us who support women’s human rights must vote. But it would be helpful if we had a party with spine to vote for.

5/17/2022,"Tops Friendly on Jefferson Avenue in East Buffalo was more than just a grocery store. It served as community center, a place to hang out, a source of employment – and a spot for healthy sustenance unavailable at bodega stores in an area described as the oasis in a food desert. In the three days since Tops became the carefully targeted site of a mass shooting and was closed indefinitely, community groups, local advocates, western New York’s emergency food network, corporate donors, churches and even Tops staff have scrambled to fill the gap. “It was everything to us. It was the heart of Jefferson,” said Jeanette Simmons, a former Tops cashier who said she had left Tops on Saturday when she heard the first gunshots. Ever since, she was finding it hard to cope. “It’s been difficult to sleep, eat, shop – everything. He took everything from us.” Simmons was standing in line at an emergency food distribution center run by the Resource Council of WNY and Feedmore WNY on Ferry Street, 10 minutes from Tops – which, although shuttered, had also set up a food distribution and counselling center nearby, and was offering a bus service to another location. Simmons said she was worried about the store remaining closed, in part because of the stimulating effect it had on other local businesses. “They paved the way for us to have things on Jefferson. I loved everything about Tops. Some people can’t afford to go way out to get food.” The site is currently an FBI crime scene. Given the death and devastation allegedly caused by the suspect Payton Gendron, some regular Tops clientele may not want to return. “I don’t want to go back in there. I knew most of the people who worked there,” said Erma Ecford. “Friday he [Gendron] was in the store. He was right there by the water when I was getting my pop. If he did it then he would have taken a lot more people out, because the store was crowded.” Police authorities have not confirmed that Gendron was in the store a day before the shooting, but Ecford’s account tallies with others in the neighborhood. Shonnell Harris Teague, a manager at Tops, claimed she saw Gendron sitting on a bench outside the store for several hours dressed in the same camouflage outfit he allegedly wore during the shooting. And late on Saturday, just hours after the violence, Grady Lewis reported a similar account. “He looked out of place,” Lewis recalled. “He was a bit of strange kid. He said he was coming to see the countryside. He talked about string theory, critical race theory, shapeshifters, the beginning of civilization.” On Monday, the Buffalo police commissioner, Joseph Gramaglia, confirmed that the suspect had visited the city in early March. Separately, a Washington Post review of more than 600 pages of messages attributed to Gendron reportedly showed he had resolved in December to kill those he slurred as “replacers”, and had decided in February to target Tops grocery store based on its local African American population. Black residents in Buffalo are six times more likely than white neighbors to live in an area without a grocery store, according to a 2018 report from the Partnership for the Public Good that linked such “food deserts” to higher rates of disease. Terry King, chief executive of Saving Grace Ministries and board chair of the Resource Council, said that most Tops customers could not drive and “were isolated from what we would normally have for goods and services”. “For two decades, before Tops was built 19 years ago, the closest grocery store was five or six miles away. Without the ability to drive they were dependent on getting food from a local bodega or store at high prices – and not the most healthy of food. So they struggled,” King said. “Tops represented something that was really important for healthy living.” In the aftermath of the killings, Ecford and others reported that threats had been made against the community and local schools: she took her grandchild out of South Park academy after one call. “We still got people out there who want to retaliate,” said Ecford. “It doesn’t make sense. I’m a senior citizen and I ain’t going nowhere. I want to get in my house and be safe.” Sherry Schenck, standing outside the Resource Center’s food bank with a bag of groceries, said she, too, was “a little shaken”. “We just ended the protests for Black Lives Matter, and now we have start it all over again,” she said. “This guy literally drove 200 miles up here and went on a rampage, killing Black people. I mean, who does that? And now our community has to suffer because of him.” Schenck said she was excited for the imminent visit of Joe Biden, and was considering what she might say, given an opportunity. “I would ask him how he’s going to change America, and especially in a city like this,” she said.",News/US news,Buffalo supermarket targeted in mass shooting was oasis in a ‘food desert’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/17/buffalo-supermarket-mass-shooting-food-desert
5/17/2022,"The “great replacement theory” can be traced back at least to Theodore G Bilbo, the brazenly racist US senator who held office from 1935 to 1947. Bilbo, an antisemite who acknowledged being a member of the Ku Klux Klan during an appearance on Meet the Press, warned that at “the present rate of interbreeding and miscegenation and intermarriage between the [N-words] and the whites … there’ll be no whites, there’ll be no Blacks in this country. We’ll all be yellow [or brown]”. In 1947, Bilbo published a book Separation or Mongrelization: Take Your Choice. In the book, Bilbo argued that “great civilizations of the ages have been produce[d] by the Caucasian race” and the “mongrel not only lacks the ability to create a civilization, but he cannot maintain a culture that he finds around him”. He asserted that the nation must choose between a “White America and a mongrel America”. Seventy-five years ago, Bilbo’s arguments were seen as extreme. The Saturday Evening Post, an influential conservative publication, called him “America’s Worst Demagogue”. In 1946, the Republican senator Robert Taft described Bilbo as “a disgrace to the Senate”. There were several efforts to remove him from office before his death from cancer in August 1947. Bilbo’s beliefs, however, were refreshed and repopularized by The Camp of the Saints, the 1973 novel by the French author Jean Raspail. The novel is “an apocalyptic tale that attempts to depict the destruction of white, Western society at the hands of mass immigration from the Global South”. The book gained popularity “among American white supremacist and anti-immigrant groups in the 1980s and 1990s”. In 2012, Renaud Camus, a French white nationalist and conspiracy theorist who was influenced by Raspail, wrote The Great Replacement. Camus argued white Europeans “are being reverse colonized by Black and Brown immigrants, who are flooding the Continent in what amounts to an extinction-level event”. The philosophical underpinnings of European white nationalism became increasingly popular among American racists. The white supremacists who gathered in Charlottesville in 2017 chanted “you will not replace us” and “Jews will not replace us.” Even though that gathering resulted in deadly violence, the racist conspiracy theory only became more popular. It was embraced first by fringe members of Congress like former representative Steve King, who tweeted “[w]e can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies” in 2017. But it was mainstreamed and popularized by Fox News’ Tucker Carlson, the nation’s most-watched political pundit. In 2021, despite heavy criticism for promoting racist conspiracy theories, Carlson described the great replacement theory as “true“ and “what’s happening, actually”. A December poll found that “about one in three US adults believes an effort is under way to replace US-born Americans with immigrants.” On Saturday, 18-year-old Payton Gendron allegedly drove more than 200 miles to a predominantly black neighborhood in Buffalo and, dressed in tactical gear, opened fire at Tops Friendly Market. He shot 13 people and 10 died. Gendron, who has been charged with murder in connection with the shooting, reportedly left behind a 180-page manifesto that “repeatedly cited” the great replacement theory. The role of Tucker Carlson in mainstreaming the great replacement theory is well-documented. But the mass shooting in Buffalo raises serious questions about many prominent Republican officials and rightwing advocates who have adopted the great replacement theory in recent years, even as the racist conspiracy was cited as motivation by previous mass shooters in Pittsburgh and El Paso. And there are many: Johnson promoted the ideas undergirding the great replacement theory during a 15 April 2022 appearance on Fox Business: “This administration wants complete open borders. And you have to ask yourself, why? Is it [that] really they want to remake the demographics of America to ensure that they stay in power forever?” Vance, who recently won the Republican nomination for a US Senate seat in Ohio, referenced concepts associated with the great replacement theory in an April 2022 town hall. He claimed Democrats were plotting to let in 15 million additional immigrants because they were confident that 70% would vote Democratic. “So you’re talking about a shift in the democratic makeup of this country that would mean we never win, meaning Republicans would never win a national election in this country ever again.” Vance made a similar claim in a campaign advertisement. The ad claims that Biden was deliberately keeping the border “open” to keep “more Democrat voters pouring into this country”. In the ad Vance, echoing Carlson, insists he is not “racist” for telling “the truth”. Masters, a Republican campaigning for the Senate in Arizona, has advanced variants of the great replacement theory on multiple podcasts and videos. He tweeted the claim on Saturday, shortly after the shooting in Buffalo: The Democrats want open borders so they can bring in and amnesty **tens of millions** of illegal aliens — that’s their electoral strategy. Not on my watch. pic.twitter.com/t9NQmEmdzG Stefanik, a member of the Republican House leadership, ran a Facebook ad with a variation of the great replacement theory. It claimed that Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Nancy Pelosi were plotting to “flood our voter roles [sic] with 11 MILLION NEW VOTERS by giving illegal immigrants amnesty”. The Albany Times-Union, Stefanik’s hometown paper, said the “despicable“ ads “repackaged” the great replacement theory. Perry promoted the great replacement theory during a House foreign affairs subcommittee hearing on immigration from Central America in April 2021: “For many Americans, what seems to be happening or what they believe right now is happening is, what appears to them is we’re replacing national-born Americans, native-born Americans to permanently transform the landscape of this very nation.” Gaetz supported Carlson on the great replacement theory and said the Anti-Defamation League was “racist” for calling for Carlson’s ouster: .@TuckerCarlson is CORRECT about Replacement Theory as he explains what is happening to America.The ADL is a racist organization. https://t.co/32Vu60HrJK In a September 2021 appearance on Fox News, Patrick said Democrats were “trying to take over our country without firing a shot” by inviting millions of immigrants into the country. Patrick said each of those immigrants would have “two or three children” who will support Democrats to thank “Biden for bringing them here”. “Laura, when I say a revolution has begun, they are allowing this year, probably 2 million, that’s who we apprehended – maybe another million into this country. At least in 18 years, even if they all don’t become citizens before they can vote – in 18 years, if every one of them has two or three children, you’re talking about millions and millions and millions of new voters. And they will thank the Democrats and Biden for bringing them here. Who do you think they’re going to vote for? “So this is trying to take over our country without firing a shot.” In October 2018, Ingraham warned Fox News viewers that Democrats “want to replace you”: “Of this my friends you can be sure: your views on immigration will have zero impact and zero influence on a House dominated by Democrats who want to replace you, the American voters, with newly amnestied citizens and an ever-increasing number of chain migrants.” In October 2019, Pirro said that Democrats were involved in “a plot to remake America – to replace American citizens with illegals who will vote for the Democrats”. Fox's Jeanine Pirro: ""It is a plot to remake America. To replace American citizens with illegals"" pic.twitter.com/SIWA1LgyRy Matt Walsh, who hosts a podcast on the Daily Wire, one of the most popular rightwing websites, promoted the great replacement theory on 13 August 2021. Walsh acknowledged that many people believe the great replacement is racist but, like Carlson, argued that it is a fact: “Now, we are told that if you speculate that the powers that be in this culture want to replace white people, we’re told this is the great replacement theory and it is a white supremacist conspiracy theory and it’s, pretty much, the worst thing you can ever say … I’m just trying to work through this in my head here, help me out – so we’re bringing in a flood of immigrants across the southern border, non-white. We’re putting policies in place with the express purpose of having fewer white people in universities and positions of power. And we’re celebrating the reduction in the white population. I mean, it sounds like you want to replace white people.” Steve Bannon, the former top aide to Donald Trump who now hosts a podcast popular with Republican candidates, was at the vanguard of popularizing the great replacement theory with Maga Republicans. Bannon repeatedly referenced The Camp of the Saints as an explanation for immigration in Europe and elsewhere. “It’s not a migration,” Bannon said in January 2016, “It’s really an invasion. I call it the Camp of the Saints.” A few months later, in a June 2016 interview with then-Senator Jeff Sessions, Bannon described a “war” against liberals in the United States who were attempting to change the nature of the country through immigration. “Do you believe the elites in this country have the backbone, have the belief in the underlying principles of the Judeo-Christian west to actually win this war?” Bannon asked. At the time, Bannon was editor of Breitbart, a far-right media outlet. A BuzzFeed exposé found that, in the run-up to the 2016 election, Breitbart collaborated with white nationalists. In the White House, Bannon was the driving force behind Trump’s ban on immigration from several Muslim countries. During the 2016 campaign, Stephen Miller, then an aide to Sessions, was in close communication with editorial staff at Breitbart. In one email, Miller encourages former Breitbart editors Katie McHugh and Julia Hahn to incorporate The Camp of Saints in their immigration coverage. “[Y]ou see the Pope saying [the] West must, in effect, get rid of borders. Someone should point out the parallels to Camp of the Saints.” A couple of weeks later, Hahn did just that: In the emails, Miller also “pushed racist immigration stories and obsessed over the loss of Confederate symbols after Dylann Roof’s murderous rampage”.After Trump became president, Miller joined the White House, where he championed hardline immigration positions. Miller currently runs America First Legal, which accused the Biden administration of “aiding, abetting, and accelerating the worst invasion of America’s southern border in history”. Trump won the presidency fearmongering about immigrants. In a July 2017 speech in Poland, Trump deployed the language of the great replacement theory. He described immigration as an issue of “survival” for “the west”. Migrants were part of a plot to “subvert and destroy” our “civilization”. “The fundamental question of our time is whether the west has the will to survive. Do we have the confidence in our values to defend them at any cost? Do we have enough respect for our citizens to protect our borders? Do we have the desire and the courage to preserve our civilization in the face of those who would subvert and destroy it?” The speech was reportedly written by Miller.

5/17/2022,"Cut off from the world and low on food and ammunition, many of the hundreds of defenders of the Azovstal steel plant in Mauripol were wounded, some missing limbs. Their capitulation had been inevitable for weeks. That moment came late on Monday as more than 260 – bearded, filthy, emaciated, and including 51 severely injured – laid down their arms and were evacuated amid a wider concession of defeat after 82 days of fighting in the besieged port city. “The ‘Mariupol’ garrison has fulfilled its combat mission,” the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said in a statement. “The supreme military command ordered the commanders of the units stationed at Azovstal to save the lives of the personnel … Defenders of Mariupol are the heroes of our time,” it added. And while several hundred fighters remained inside the plant, their commanders admitted their mission had “concluded” while officials continued with negotiations to “evacuate them”. Late on Monday, five buses carrying troops from Azovstal were seen arriving in nearby Russian-controlled Novoazovsk. In one, marked with a Z like many Russian military vehicles in Ukraine, men were stacked on stretchers on three levels. In a long-denied victory for the Kremlin, a battle that has gripped the world’s attention appeared finally over, leaving a city in ruins and perhaps thousands of civilians dead. With its urban areas sprawling along the coastline of the Sea of Azov in the shape of a comma, the siege of Mariupol came to define one of the most brutal episodes in Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. It was one of the first major cities to be encircled and viewed as one of the Kremlin’s key objectives both for its economic importance and as a stepping stone in building a land bridge from Russia to Russian-occupied Crimea. The capture of Mariupol loomed large in the Kremlin’s imagination for propaganda purposes too: as the home base of the Azov brigade, which at its 2014 inception, when the war in Donbas began, included far-right volunteers, some with neo-Nazi affiliations. (In recent years the brigade has been fully integrated into the Ukrainian military). It was the sheer levels of violence inflicted on the city and on its civilian population day after day, however, that has kept Mariupol in the headlines. The few who have been able to enter the city, including the International Committee for the Red Cross, have described conditions in the city as “apocalyptic”. Those civilians who have managed to escape in the weeks of the encirclement have often had to run a gauntlet of Russian shell fire, even when humanitarian corridors were supposed to have been negotiated. Health facilities, including the city’s maternity hospitals, have been hit in lethal attacks. In March, in one of the most grisly incidents, the Donetsk regional drama theatre in the city, where large numbers of civilians were sheltering was bombed, killing hundreds. Mariupol’s war, like many other areas in Ukraine, began in the bitter winter chill of the early hours of 24 February as Russian shells began landing in the city. What marked Mariupol out as different, however, was its proximity to Russian-allied forces in the breakaway Donetsk region and the fact that, unlike many others places, it was largely shut off from reporters. Instead, Mariupol’s story has been largely dramatised by its mayor, Vadym Boichenko. In the earliest weeks of the war Mariupol was not yet entirely cut off from the rest of the country. Reinforcements from cities as distant as Lviv were able to bolster the frontlines. But as the war ground on, even those few entry points were being shut off. With attacking Russian forces – backed by fighters of the notorious Chechen warlord, Ramzan Kadyrov – demanding the city surrender, on 4 March, Boichenko warned gravely of the dangers facing trapped civilians. “We are simply being destroyed,” he said in a shaky video appeal, describing indiscriminate shelling of residential areas and hospitals. “They want to wipe Mariupol and Mariupol residents off the face of the earth.” A day later Boichenko’s warning was underlined by the Red Cross even as it tried to negotiate a humanitarian corridor for residents to flee, adding that many people were stranded in shelters without food, water or electricity. And the situation was worsening. By 12 March, Russian forces had captured the eastern suburbs of the city, tightening their grip. On 16 March, the theatre was bombed as hundreds of civilians sheltered inside. “I do not want to believe in this horror,” the Mariupol municipality said in a statement on Telegram. An investigation by Associated Press published earlier this month suggested about 600 people may have died in that attack alone. The violence aimed at the port city has been a reflection on how long it has held out, with its defenders dug into well protected positions, including within the labyrinth of the sprawling Azovstal steelworks, covering an area of about 4 sq miles, including underground tunnels. Inverting history, the steelworks has become to Mariupol what the factory district was for Stalingrad’s Russian defenders, even as the Kremlin claimed prematurely, on several occasions, to have taken it. But unlike Stalingrad, which could be resupplied across the Volga river, the Ukrainian defenders of Mariupol have been cut off from resupply by the surrounding Russian forces and also by their naval blockade of the Black and Azov seas. As the Russians advanced ever further into the city, the defending forces issued statements reflecting their perilous position – as they ran out of ammunition, unable to care for their hundreds of wounded, forcing units to surrender. Last week more than 1,000 soldiers of Ukraine’s 36th marine brigade, including scores of officers and several Britons fighting in the city, surrendered. Other members of the same unit, who held on inside the Azovstal steel plant along with members of the Azov brigade and more than 1,000 civilians, were clear they could not hold out much longer, outnumbered 10 to one and with no hope of relief. A Ukrainian commander in Mariupol sent a message saying “they will soon kill us” as he sheltered from Russia’s bombardment of the steelworks where his troops were making a last stand. Among them was Serhiy Volynskyi, of the 36th marine brigade, who sent a message from inside the plant as Moscow stepped up its assault calling on the last defenders to give up or die. In a video message that was widely posted, Volynski had appealed for help from the world to allow them to leave. “We are only defending one objective: the Azovstal plant where, in addition to military personnel, there are also civilians who have fallen victim to this war,” he said, adding he believed those in the plant had, at best days at worst hours, to live. “They have advantage in the air, in artillery, in their forces on land, in equipment and in tanks.” The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, then ordered his forces not to storm the last remaining Ukrainian stronghold but instead to block it “so that not even a fly comes through”. Before the order to surrender, that encirclement was total. Civilians who were finally evacuated from the steel plant in May spoke of the awful conditions, with so little food and water that adults were eating one tiny meal a day. “No one came out of there unchanged,” said Oksana, an Azovstal employee who asked not to give her full name after her escape. “They were one person when they went in, and another person when they came out.” And there are questions still unresolved, not least how many Ukrainian civilians died inside Mariupol, an issue unlikely to be resolved while it is under full Russian control. Ukrainian officials have suggested that the death toll could well exceed 20,000. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, has also warned of high casualties. “We estimate the civilian death toll in Mariupol to lie in the thousands, while only with time will the true scale of atrocities, casualties and damage become clear.” Boichenko has suggested that Russia has been hiding evidence of the civilian deaths by shelling a mass grave. “The invaders are concealing evidence of their crimes,” the mayor said. “The cemetery is located near a petrol station to the left side of a circular road. The Russians have dug huge trenches, 30 metres wide. They chuck people in.” The other issue will be the fate of the surrendered Ukrainian defenders who Kyiv now hopes to exchange for Russian prisoners of war. “We hope that we will be able to save the lives of our guys,” Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in an early morning address. “There are severely wounded ones among them. They’re receiving care. Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes alive.” For those inside the Azovstal plant the concession of defeat was coloured with fatalism. The commander of the Azov regiment inside the steelworks, Denys Prokopenko, said in a prerecorded video message released on Monday that the regiment’s mission was finally over, with as many lives saved as possible. “Absolutely safe plans and operations don’t exist during war,” he concluded grimly.",News/World news,‘Defenders of Mariupol are the heroes of our time’: the battle that gripped the world ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/17/defenders-of-mariupol-are-the-heroes-of-our-time-the-battle-that-gripped-the-world
5/17/2022,"Two crucial byelections in Wakefield and in Tiverton and Honiton will take place on 23 June, with the Conservatives fighting to keep the seats from Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Both seats will be fought after the Tory MPs resigned following scandals. The former Wakefield MP Imran Ahmad Khan resigned after being found guilty of child sexual assault against a 15-year-old boy. In the Devon seat, Neil Parish resigned as MP after admitting watching pornography twice in the House of Commons chamber. Though there is no formal pact in place, Labour and the Lib Dems will campaign with the tacit understanding that they will each focus attention on separate seats to maximise each party’s chances. Labour will focus its resources on the West Yorkshire seat, which the Conservatives took for the first time since 1931 at the last election. Keir Starmer’s party is widely expected to take the seat, which has a majority of just over 3,000. The party has selected Simon Lightwood, an NHS worker and former staffer for the former Labour MP Mary Creagh, after a difficult selection battle in which the local party’s executive resigned in protest at some local candidates being excluded from the final shortlist. Labour has been defensive about its decision to shortlist only two candidates and said Lightwood had lived in the constituency for 10 years – with one source saying that “a small clique of Corbynites had held local party to ransom”. The Lib Dems are hoping to make similar inroads in Tiverton, which has a huge Conservative majority of more than 24,000, though the expectation is high for the party to win the seat given two shock byelection wins in seats with big Tory majorities – Chesham and Amersham and North Shropshire. Parish said he may run in the byelection as an independent, stating that he has been pledged financial support. No other party has announced a candidate so far. The Lib Dem leader, Ed Davey, said on Monday that while taking the seat would be a huge task, the Lib Dems’ success in last year’s North Shropshire byelection – another rural seat formerly held by a disgraced Tory – showed it was possible. Responding to the date for the byelection, Davey said: “People in rural communities like Devon have had enough of being neglected by this Conservative government. “The Conservatives’ failure to tackle the cost of living crisis has left millions struggling to pay their bills, while people wait hours for an ambulance and weeks for a GP or dentist appointment. “The Liberal Democrats are the main challengers to the Conservatives in Tiverton and Honiton. On 23 June voters can send Boris Johnson’s government a message they cannot ignore and elect a strong local champion who will stand up for them.”",News/Politics,Tories fight to hold off Labour and Lib Dems in crucial June byelections,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/17/tories-fight-to-hold-off-labour-and-lib-dems-in-crucial-june-byelections
5/17/2022,"Avatar 2 will be the riskiest film of the year for all sorts of reasons. There’s the issue of whether or not the public actually wants a 12-years-in-the-making sequel to a film that has retained no cultural cachet whatsoever. There’s the fact that, if it flops, James Cameron still has to release three more Avatar movies after this one. But most of all, Avatar 2 will have to convince us all to wear stupid 3D glasses again. A decade ago, 3D was supposed to be the future of cinema. Thanks to the first Avatar, which used the technology to drop us into gorgeous, immersive alien landscapes, every big budget movie enthusiastically strapped itself to this new way of film-making. Peter Jackson made 3D films. Ridley Scott made a 3D film. Martin Scorsese made a 3D film. Ang Lee made a 3D film and won an Oscar for it, for crying out loud. Sure, we were told, 3D might have started out as a 1950s gimmick, but this time it was going to be different. “3D is here to stay,” announced an arguably too bold Techcrunch piece from 2010. “To abandon it would be a boondoggle of proportions Hollywood is unwilling to make. And ten years from now, we’ll be looking back on a library not of a dozen, but of hundreds of 3D films, some of which (we may hope) will rise to the level of quality set by the classics of the past.” The more eagle-eyed among you will have noticed that things didn’t exactly shake out the way that Techcrunch thought. In reality, the new 3D revolution turned out to be yet another gimmick. The glasses were tight, uncomfortable and environmentally suspect. They hurt your eyes. They made the viewing experience darker. What’s more, the simple act of screening a film in 3D meant that cinemas were given free rein to hike up the price of a ticket beyond all measure. And if all that wasn’t bad enough, the films themselves were actually often wildly superior in 2D, having been shoved through a lazy post-production 3D conversion as part of a dismal movie studio cash grab. Little wonder it died a death. Which isn’t to say that people stopped making 3D films altogether. They’re still being released; this year’s Doctor Strange had a 3D release, as did Dune, Encanto, Godzilla vs Kong and the last Star Wars movie. But the sense is that these are simply marginal sideshows, in 2017 accounting for just 17% of theatrical revenue. They exist if people want a slightly different experience, but they are by no means the definitive version of the film. In fact, 3D seems to have become just another way to rake in extra money. My local multiplex, for example, has just reopened after a refurbishment, and it now offers a mind-boggling array of viewing formats. You can watch films in 2D and 3D, but also Imax, 4DX (in which your seat flings you around in time with the action) and a monumentally stupid gimmick called ScreenX where, at various intervals through the film, the walls of the auditorium will glow with additional 270-degree wraparound footage. These are all clearly designed to combat the rise of day-and-date home releases – yes, you can watch The Matrix 4 on your sofa, but will it launch you about the room whenever there’s a car chase? – but they do all feel like the desperate fumbling of an industry in trouble. And all of this is going to make it especially difficult for Avatar. It has been over a decade since it last had to educate audiences about 3D cinema, but now it finds itself in exactly the same position for the sequel. A recent Hollywood Reporter article quoted the Imax Entertainment president, Megan Colligan, as saying “Warming up 3D has to be done thoughtfully and carefully,” adding that “There were a lot of lessons learned” during the last 3D boom. The producers of Avatar 2, and the cinema industry in general, seem to be especially keen to stop 3D from becoming a gimmick again. We won’t know how successful they’ll be for another 10 years. But if history has taught us anything, it’s that we probably shouldn’t get too excited.",Arts/Film,Fish out your glasses! 3D movies are about to make a comeback,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/17/avatar-2-3d-glasses-comeback
