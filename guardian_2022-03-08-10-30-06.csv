3/8/2022,"International Women’s Day is upon us, and along with it the endless gabfests about women’s equality, mostly led and attended by women in suits. Increasingly we’re seeing women’s safety feature in the discussion and cursory mentions of issues facing Blak, disabled and queer women. But in 2022 the conversation about women’s equality and safety is still lacking the voices of people in the worst circumstances and those at highest risk of harm. In the lead-up to IWD, a slick new campaign with the tagline #SafetyRespectEquity has been launched to near universal praise. There’s no denying privileged women experience violent relationships. But, just as I feared, there was a glaring gap, a major threat to women’s safety that didn’t even rate a cursory mention in the campaign: poverty. The welfare system is deeply imbued with misogyny. In my work as an anti-poverty activist I hear far too many examples of how it traps women in unsafe situations, whether in the workplace, the family home or a relationship. It disproportionately harms Blak, trans and disabled people. I agree with other advocates who say it’s harmful by design. We see the results in the stomach-churning statistics. Chronic underinvestment in public housing and social security payments as low as half the poverty line means in a year 7,700 women return to their abuser due to risk of homelessness and 9,000 survivors who leave for good end up homeless. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Ninety per cent of women with intellectual disability have experienced sexual abuse. I am told stories by women who weren’t able to escape this abuse because the “safety net” failed them. According to Anti-Poverty Week* women aged 21-28 years in financial hardship were more than three times as likely to report severe partner abuse in a year. In 2019 more than 60,000 women aged 15-24 years who experienced violence also experienced moderate to very high levels of financial hardship. There are myriad reasons women are excluded from accessing support altogether. As my colleague Jay Coonan wrote recently, the partner income test is rooted in sexism and is a paternalistic hangover from a period when women were viewed only through the prism of their relationship to men. The rule reduces or cuts people off if Centrelink deems someone to be in a relationship, regardless of whether finances are shared. It’s been retained only to save the government money, at great cost to women who are forced into financial dependence – itself a contributor to the strain that can lead to relationship breakdown. Women living in Australia on the wrong visa type have no entitlement to an income support payment at all. And once you become a citizen, you are still excluded from payments such as the disability support pension – good luck to anyone who needs it within 10 years of moving here. When people who are forced to comply with punitive “mutual” obligations face sexual harassment and assault because of these activities, they are trapped. Leaving means losing your poverty payment. Women incur social security debts as a direct result of the actions of their abuser. They have payments wrongly cut off at an extraordinary rate, punishing both women and their children. And then there’s the most abusive and insidious policy: cashless welfare programs like the cashless debit card that control women’s income and restrict their ability to survive in poverty. It’s a racist program with its origins in the Howard government’s Northern Territory intervention and ever since it has targeted and punished First Nations women. Dr Elise Klein found that the CDC has not only failed to reduce violence, as the government says it’s designed to do, but there has been an increase in violence after its introduction. Of course, it goes without saying setting every income support payment at a poverty level causes direct harm. The most common payment, jobseeker, is just half the Henderson poverty line. The government’s national action plan to reduce violence against women and their children is completely silent on financial abuse. They refuse to even mention “social security” in the strategy to address family and domestic violence, while the National Council of Single Mothers and their Children says the welfare system is replicating the hallmarks of family and domestic violence. If this isn’t violence against women, what is? Advocates for women in poverty have put forward many proposals to address these harrowing statistics. We don’t need a special payment or special rules for people fleeing violent relationships. Targeted programs in effect act as a means test for people who are able to “prove” their circumstances to Centrelink – itself a traumatising process. Any such program will inevitably exclude many people experiencing or at risk of violence, particularly trans and disabled people trapped in unsafe environments because they don’t have the money to escape. The answer to ameliorating the disproportionate harm caused to women by the welfare system is a universal response that protects all women and trans folks by equipping us with access to enough resources to keep ourselves safe. We need more money but that’s not all. Raising all payments to above the Henderson poverty line while we do the work of developing a more sophisticated measure of poverty is a first step only and will not go far enough. It must be easier and faster to access welfare payments. Everyone living in Australia must be able to access them, regardless of visa status. People cannot be forced from one abusive situation to another – removing dangerous and punitive measure like ‘mutual’ obligations requirements and cashless welfare must be a priority. My friend Elly Baxter puts it simply: “The fact that mainstream feminism routinely ignores marginalised women is the reason we have been so stunted in our progress.” As an anti-poverty activist it’s clear to me that the design of the welfare system – its inadequacy, who it excludes and how it operates – is undeniably the top reason women are unsafe. It hurts us whether we’re desperately trying to avoid it, desperately trying to escape it, or see no way out of it. There is no pathway to safety, respect and equity for all women without a robust social safety net to protect those who are most disadvantaged. It’s time corporate feminism grappled with it and realised that the movement for women’s safety must not just include but be led by Blak, disabled, trans and people who rely on the welfare system to live.

3/8/2022,"Baden Hicks battled drug addiction for 20 years, during which he says he survived 18 overdoses, five by the “skin of his teeth”. He has experienced homelessness, been in and out of psychiatric wards and jail. But the 36-year-old wants to be known as more than “just a drug addict”. “I’m a father, I’m a brother, I’m a son, I’m a grandson, I’m an uncle. Through my functional addict years, I got a boilermaker apprenticeship, I went to night school and did further studies in that. I worked in the dive industry for eight years. I’m a scuba diver and a spear fisher,” he tells Guardian Australia. “People don’t choose to become drug addicts. There’s a reason why people generally use drugs. For me, I used drugs to deal with a lot of pain in my life, which really felt unbearable.” Having graduated from marijuana to cocaine, heroin, speed and ice, Hicks credits lawyer Michelle Goldberg from First Step with saving his life after she represented him in a case, introduced him to a mental health worker and helped him get a place in the service’s ResetLife program. He has now been in recovery for 15 months and has completed a certificate IV in alcohol and other drugs, is volunteering at First Step and working in peer support at Turning Point, an addiction research and education centre in Richmond, Melbourne. He has also spent time at Victoria’s parliament in recent weeks to garner support for a bill put forward by Reason party MP Fiona Patten to decriminalise drugs. Under Patten’s bill, to be debated on Wednesday, police would issue a compulsory notice and referral to drug education or treatment to people believed to have used or possessed a drug of dependence. If they comply, there would be no finding of guilt and no recorded criminal outcome. Patten has described the war on drugs as “one of the most disastrous public policy failures in modern history”, which has destroyed lives, wasted money and created a black market that has enriched organised criminals. “What we’re doing hasn’t reduced arrests, it hasn’t reduced harm. It hasn’t reduced use,” she tells Guardian Australia. Decriminalisation is supported by the United Nations and the World Health Organization and in Australia by the Australian Medical Association, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the Royal Australian College of Physicians, as well as several key drug and alcohol bodies. But getting politicians to buy in is another matter entirely. Both the Andrews government and the opposition have ruled out supporting Patten’s bill. “We know the harmful impact illicit drug use can have on the community – that’s why Victoria police is constantly focused on targeting drug dealers and manufacturers to break up their criminal activity,” a government spokesperson says. That’s despite costings by the Parliamentary Budget Office that found Patten’s proposal would save the state $33m between 2021/22 and 2024/25 and more in following years, thanks to a reduction in drug enforcement activity by courts and prisons, although this would be partially offset by a decrease in revenue of $1.3m due to a reduction in fines. Patten describes her model as a “streamlined” version of what’s in place in Portugal, which saw drops in problematic drug use, HIV and hepatitis infection rates, overdose deaths, drug-related crime and incarceration rates when it became the first country to decriminalise the possession and consumption of all illicit substances in 2001. Victoria isn’t the first Australian jurisdiction to debate decriminalisation. Possession of cannabis has been decriminalised in Australian Capital Territory, South Australia and Northern Territory for decades. There’s also a private member’s bill before the ACT parliament that, if passed, would allow people found with a personal supply of drugs to pay a small fine rather than face criminal charges. In New South Wales, a plan to introduce a “three chance” warning system for people found with small quantities of drugs was put to cabinet in December 2020 but opposed by several ministers including deputy premier John Barilaro and police minister David Elliott. Patrick Lawrence, CEO of First Step, says in his 20 years working in the sector he has never met someone dealing with addiction who hasn’t suffered trauma. “The greatest impact of our current drug laws is felt not by the recreational drug user but people who have survived childhood poverty, sexual abuse, homelessness and the absence of love and bonding,” he says. According to the Victoria Police Drug Strategy 2020/2025, police are focused on targeting drug dealers and manufacturers to break up their criminal activity and connecting those suffering addiction with treatment and support services. The strategy states drug problems are “first and foremost health issues” and urges officers to show empathy: “Drug users could be our children, members of our family, our friends or people who have lost their way. When we see the human, we will see the way forward.” Greg Denham was part of Victoria police in the mid-1990s when a drug policy expert committee set up by then-premier Jeff Kennett recommended the adoption of a harm-minimisation approach. The committee, headed by academic David Penington, also called for the use and possession of small amounts of cannabis no longer to be an offence, while heroin and other drugs to remain illegal, but with the use of cautions and referral to drug treatment centres for the first offence. Diversions were introduced and were being used in 80% of circumstances, Denham says. “At the time police were advised that they should use it as often as they can, that a person can get more than one drug diversion. But a lot of police started to say ‘Well, why should we give them a second chance? Why should we give them a slap on the wrist so many times?’” he says, noting diversions are currently being used in 20% of circumstances. “We need policies that are actually enshrined in law rather than just words that can be easily ignored and disregarded.” Denham says the state has “slipped backwards” when it comes to drug policy reform and blames politicians. “It’s almost become a taboo topic. They’re so concerned their words may be misconstrued or they may be the next headline in the tabloid press,” Denham says. The Police Association secretary Wayne Gatt, however, maintains Patten’s bill is not needed, given officers have been issuing cautions and diverting people into treatment programs for many years. “To be quite honest the settings at the moment are quite balanced. It’s simply a fallacy to suggest that low-level drug users are all going to jail,” he told reporters last month. Patten, who has successfully led campaigns on other social reforms, including the Richmond supervised injecting room, the enactment of the nation’s first assisted dying laws and most recently, the decriminalisation of sex work, concedes her bill won’t pass without the support of one of the major parties. But she is hopeful for a commitment to progress, potentially through a trial, which wouldn’t require legislation. On Hicks’s right arm is a tattoo of a “moral compass”. Instead of coordinates, he is guided by morality, wisdom, humility and courage. He hopes politicians will take the same approach. “I hear politicians say they want to focus on mental health and physical health issues. My mental health issues and physical issues have been caused by addiction. You treat addiction and then you’re going to be treating mental illness,” he says. “You treat addiction, you change people’s lives.”  Crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

3/8/2022,"If history is our guide, a change of federal government at the upcoming election will come in an irresistible wave or not at all. Since Gough Whitlam* ended more than two decades of Tory rule in 1972, every change of government has been a landslide. Malcolm Fraser picked up 30 seats in 1975, Bob Hawke snared 24 in 1983, John Howard gained 29 seats in 1996, Kevin Rudd won 23 in 2007 and even Tony Abbott acquired 18 extra seats in 2013. Conversely there has not been a single win from a federal opposition in a close contest in the past 50 years. When it gets down to seat-by-seat combat, the advantages of incumbency in timing, logistics and budget see even beleaguered administrations cling on to power. It is wrong to think of a federal election as a horse race. Rather it is a contest for power where the protagonists have very different objectives: one is trying to protect the shoreline from the high ground; the other is trying to get through the defences by surfing a mood for change. When government changes the nation’s next leader senses (and sometimes shapes) the wave, gets into position from the back of the break and finds a way to remain upright. This requires a combination of policy adroitness, organisational capability and a leader’s capacity to merge their personal qualities with the zeitgeist. For Whitlam it was simply “time” after decades of Tory rule; for Fraser it was an end to the chaos and conflict that he himself helped foment; Hawke unified a fractious nation; Howard promised to slow things down; Rudd was a safe antidote to ideological overreach; while Abbott just said “no” at a time the public had lost faith in a divided government. Looking at pre-election polls the critical question is not “Who is ahead?”, but is there a wave for change-building? This is devilishly hard to pick, as the waves often break late as the undeclared voters (who we are recognising in our 2PP Plus model for the first time this cycle) finally make their choice. This week’s Guardian Essential Report suggests that the tide is going out on the Morrison government, with nearly half of respondents thinking it’s time to give some else a go. The appetite for change has been building since we first asked this question last August but appears to be peaking at the right time for Labor, although one in five voters are yet to form a definitive view. Digging down into these figures, the sense it’s someone’s else turn is strongest among younger voters: 56% of under 35s are ready for change while only 40% of over 55s are ready to shift. If a wave is forming the critical question becomes whether the opposition has the pose and dexterity to get to the shore. It is here where the different rules of engagement kick in. Incumbents hold on to power by using their significant structural advantages to knock the challenger off their board and into the whitewash: think Keating’s 1993 GST scare, Howard’s border panic and more recently Morrison’s tax chimera. This is what the prime minister has been doing since the start of this year. Sensing a wave fuelled by Covid fatigue and his own malfeasance building, he is frantically looking for ways to interrupt momentum: on religious freedom, national security fears about China, and anything to make the water choppier for the challenger. Now the impact of what is likely to be a long and traumatic war in Ukraine, vividly brought home via traditional and social media, looms as a new wild card but, as this week’s poll shows, not at face value a winning hand. While there appears no real partisan difference on Ukraine in the eye of the voting public, the extent to which the war fills the public spaces where elections are usually fought has a real prospect of stemming the tide or at least reducing its intensity. This will have a real impact on Anthony Albanese who needs public focus to establish himself to the many voters who still don’t have a clear sense of him. In contrast, a protracted war provides Morrison with a guaranteed program of nationally significant set pieces to portray his carefully curated public persona from. There is no denying the magician Morrison has begun to give up his tricks, with approval ratings now in negative territory. But do not underestimate the resilience of the “ScoMo” brand for voters looking out of the corner of their eyes. To them the PM is still the family man who loves the Sharkies and goes to church, and while he may have stuffed up a few things, it’s hardly poor old ScoMo’s fault that there was a pandemic. In contrast, there’s a sense that Albanese remains hidden. Despite his 26 years in the federal parliament and service as deputy prime minister he still appears to many prosaic. Part of this is by design: Labor has clearly recalibrated after 2019’s ambitions while through the first phase of the pandemic the only credible course for opposition was to stay out of the way. Albanese has a compelling story to tell: someone born into social housing who has never forgotten where he came from, someone who has shown loyalty to his local community, leading the grassroots campaign to save the Bunnies against the power of Murdoch’s Super League. So can Albo get there? As our polling suggests the majority of us are over this chapter of national leadership and ready for a change. What currently seems missing is the drumbeat coming from the ground up. This is where those of us who want to see a change of government come in. This is a tough election for progressives. Like someone dealing with a traumatic, life-changing accident, we need to confront our demons of certainty from 2019 and lean in behind our designated surfer. Australians with disability are currently marshalling forces to defend the NDIS; the aged care sector has had a gutful; doctors are calling out crisis on our public hospitals; anyone in the creative industry or universities is still reeling from the calculated hit during lockdown; workers are sick of a system that turns their wages into dividends and executive bonuses; women are turning their backs; farmers and businesses have moved on from the climate wars and are waiting for government to follow. For all these people things have gone way beyond any one policy: this is about the very essence of being collaboratively led rather than cynically played. With so much at stake surely we all need to do better than sit back and watch the political contest as if it were a spectator sport and wait for Albo to perform his own miracle on water solo. History tells us that when governments change it is not just about the leaders, or the policies, or the field operation. It’s also about us. Are we prepared to not just vote for change but find a way to be part of it?
