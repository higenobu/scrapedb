3/12/2022,"Joe Biden announced on Friday that the US plans to ban the import of seafood, vodka and diamonds from Russia in retaliation for Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine. The US president said the ban would be part of a move by America to revoke normal trading relations, with Russia, also known as “most favored nation” status, with a similar move also expected from allies in the Group of Seven (G7) leading nations and the European Union. Revoking such trading relations will “make it harder for Russia to do business with the United States”, Biden said and noted that the US was “taking the first steps” to ban imports of Russian “seafood, vodka and diamonds”. “Putin is the aggressor and Putin must pay a price,” he said. Biden said the US was also banning the export of luxury goods to Russia, calling it the latest, but “not the last step we’re going to take”. We’re also taking the further step of banning the import of goods from several signature sectors of Russia’s economy including seafood, vodka, and diamonds.The G7 will also seek to deny Russia the ability to borrow from leading multilateral institutions. Stripping most favored nation status from Russia would allow the US and allies to impose higher tariffs on some imports, increasing the isolation of the Russian economy. It follows days after the Biden moved to ban imports of Russian oil and gas products. Other measures taken include the freezing of central bank assets, limits on exports and sanctions against Russian oligarchs and their families. These financial tools have led to the Russian rouble losing 76% of its value against the US dollar over the past month, which has caused destructive inflation that could erode Putin’s ability to wage a prolonged war in Ukraine. Most favored nation status has been a baseline for global trade, ensuring that countries within the World Trade Organization are treated similarly. Some countries in the WTO have special privileges due to their status as developing economies. Russia would join the ranks of Cuba and North Korea by not having MFN status from the US. The revocation, however, carries mostly symbolic weight. The earlier sanctions on imports of Russian oil, gas and coal already cut off about 60% of US imports from the country, and the new import bans announced on Friday add up to only about $1bn in revenue, according to White House figures. Russia provided less than 1% of US vodka imports in December, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the US, and less than 2% of US seafood imports by volume, according to federal statistics.",News/World news,"US bans import of Russian vodka, seafood and diamonds",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/us-bans-russian-vodka-seafood-diamonds-ukraine
3/12/2022,"Dead people are weird, aren’t they? They all used to be alive, so they know the terrestrial community would dearly love to hear just one more time from their deceased loved ones. Yet throughout history, dead people have made that difficult by choosing chintzy eccentrics to be their living spokespeople, operating in odd locations and formats: tents on the periphery of fairgrounds, live gigs in shabby coastal theatres and, more recently, cheaply made television shows that never quite make it to major channels. Apparently, one of the things to fear about the afterlife is that it gives you a taste for cheesy showmen. Their latest wheeze for getting in touch is Life After Death With Tyler Henry (Netflix), a showcase for a young American clairvoyant previously known for the series Hollywood Medium on the E! network. A self-confessed Macaulay Culkin lookalike with a sudden, blinding grin, Henry travels through the sunny southern states giving comfort to punters in need of help, like a morbid Marie Kondo or a member of the Queer Eye “fab five” with a sixth sense. Henry brings a clean-cut sparkle to the psychic arena. Having made his name doing readings for celebrities, he is now working with folk who aren’t famous, even if he seems to attract a lot of Californians with ocean-view terraces. His main gimmick, however, is scribbling. Drawing is this medium’s medium: the visions come to him more clearly if he is doodling abstractly on paper. Clients gasp in anticipation when he opens up his trademark A4 leatherbound and whips out a rollerball. What happens in a standard Life After Death scene will, however, be familiar to anyone who has seen clairvoyants in action before. Conversations are dominated by inexact messages that have universal application – another inexplicable quirk of the talking dead. When people die of a sudden illness, their loved ones often think medical attention came too slowly; people with a terminal condition often have a period where they feel something indefinable is wrong; people who die young are often remembered as having been unusually full of life; death and birth often seem to arrive together. Henry’s vague suggestions of these things are taken, by desperate participants, as evidence of a specific supernatural dialogue. Henry has an unfortunate habit of hitting on just the sort of thing that might be guessed by someone who is merely pretending to be a conduit to the spirit world. In one episode he correctly asserts that a woman’s murdered brother had been hanging around with the wrong people before his death; in another, he stuns a hip-hop producer by intuiting that someone known to him had a strong interest in sneakers. Plus, of course, we don’t know what’s been edited out, what’s been said to researchers beforehand or what information is already in the public domain. These things matter because, despite his unassuming air, Henry is unafraid to make hard promises. A gay man is reassured that his homophobic mother has repented in the next life, while a woman whose son died by drowning is told that he doesn’t blame the companions who failed to rescue him. Even the woman whose brother was murdered, who introduces herself as actively trying to solve a criminal case, does not seem to give Henry pause. He seems a jolly, superficially unencumbered soul, spending much of his time between sessions riding in a car with his amusingly matter-of-fact assistant Heather – who tends to respond to the arrival of fresh revelations with a non-committal “Oh”, “Yeah” or “Hmm”. Or hanging out with his mom Theresa, who’s an important figure here.. When he’s not travelling, flipping tarot cards or enjoying his purpose-built “psychomanteum chamber” (a big wooden box), Henry is accompanying Theresa on their own quest for answers, which steers Life After Death into an unexpected genealogical subplot. The Henry family have discovered, via a DNA test, that Tyler’s grandmother is not in fact Theresa’s biological mother. So who is? Finding that out means hearing the story of a poverty-stricken mother who gave up a child, something uncovered by talking to living people about earthbound struggles. Sad, cold reality occasionally interrupts this show’s flow: in the final episode, Henry, who has already told us that he was so lonely and alienated as a gay only child that he considered suicide during his teens, reveals that his gifts first made themselves known soon after the loss of a close relative. Perhaps he, more than anyone, yearns for the dead to speak.",Arts/Television & radio,Life After Death With Tyler Henry review – is this clairvoyant documentary for real?,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/11/life-after-death-with-tyler-henry-review-netflix
3/12/2022,"Just as a blind squirrel occasionally finds a nut, so Liz Truss has put her finger on something true. On Thursday the foreign secretary gave a speech, in which she declared: “The invasion of Ukraine is a paradigm shift on the scale of 9/11.” Like the uncanny feeling that comes on seeing a stopped clock telling the right time, it was a jolt to hear a halfway accurate assessment come from a senior member of the UK government. Still, naturally, there were things Truss did not and would not say. For one thing, what no one will call 2/24 is likely to prove even more significant than 9/11. For another, the chief value in making a comparison between this moment and the agony of September 2001 is to ensure we don’t make the same mistakes all over again. Start with the aptness of the parallel. The attacks on New York and Washington were understood at the time as a summons to the democratic world to defend a fundamental principle of freedom. That summons is louder now, not least because the threat Vladimir Putin poses is sharper than the one represented by the 9/11 hijackers, the principle under assault clearer. By invading Ukraine, he has violated the basic concept of sovereignty and self-determination by which nations coexist. He has said that big states can gobble up smaller ones, turning their people into vassals. In that move, he has taken an axe to the way our world is ordered and the only way it can function. The perpetrators of 9/11 were also seen as representing a deeper peril endangering our values and way of life: they were cast as a nihilistic cult that loved death as much as their targets loved life. Whatever its merits as a description back then, nihilism is a fitting way to characterise the Putinist menace now. Witness its revelling in destruction and contempt for human life, expressed in the repeated bombardment of Ukrainian civilians, even those fleeing for safety; the deliberate targeting of apartment buildings, kindergartens and hospitals, including one in Mariupol for mothers, children and babies. Read the lies about those attacks, delivered with a wink and, visible in the tweets from official Russian government accounts, a hint of a smile. Contemplate the state-generated disinformation that brazenly says day is night and night is day, that Russia’s neighbours need not fear invasion, because Russia “has not invaded Ukraine”. Watch the orchestrated rallies of young ultra-nationalists, all wearing the Z symbol as they perform their repeated right-arm salutes, even if you try to banish the obvious historic echoes. Stare all that in the face and you can’t help but conclude that what you’re looking at is indeed a cult of nihilism. And, of course, this one matters so much more than the version that announced itself on 9/11, because this one has state power. Putinism commands a nuclear arsenal and a vast, if creaking, military. While the US and its allies were fighting the “war on terror”, Putin was advancing step by step towards this current moment, slowly choking Russia’s infant democracy at home and honing his methods abroad. The land grab on Georgia in 2008 and the seizure of Crimea in 2014; the wanton destruction inflicted on Syria, effected by means of the same pitiless battering he had meted out in Chechnya – all of it in plain sight. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine did not come out of a clear blue sky. As the BBC’s Quentin Sommerville put it, in a deeply disturbing report from Kharkiv: “If you don’t recognise these tactics, then you haven’t been paying attention.” But that was the problem: western governments were looking the other way. Which brings us to those areas where Liz Truss feared to tread. If this truly is a paradigm shift on a par with 9/11, then the first lesson has to be: let’s not mess it up like we did last time. One mistake will be easy to avoid. George W Bush and Tony Blair erred by unleashing the rhetoric and methods of war for what should have been a police operation. Dangerous terrorists who should have been the targets of long, intensive and complex police and intelligence work were instead elevated into martial enemies, giving them the very status they craved. No danger of that specific category error this time: this is an actual war, involving an actual state. But the risk of misidentifying the enemy remains. Two decades ago, hawks rushed to hail a “clash of civilisations”, as if the west was destined to do battle not with a particular, narrowly defined group of violent jihadists but with Islamism if not Islam itself. That was a fateful and fatal mistake. It saw the US and UK lash out wildly, conquering Afghanistan when a special forces effort to root out al-Qaida was what was required; and, most disastrously, invading Iraq in pursuit of weapons that did not exist. It also saw a battery of domestic moves whose consequence was not the isolation and apprehension of violent jihadists alone, but the demonisation and exclusion of Muslims. The west must not make that mistake again. It has to be specific. The battle now is against Putin and Putinism, not Russia or Russians. Severing links with institutions tied to the Kremlin makes sense; banning a course on the novels of Dostoevsky is dumb. Most Russians are themselves victims of Putinism. They are the ones who have been robbed blind by him and his henchmen; they are the ones force-fed lies. In the war against Putinism, they will be essential allies. The Washington-based scholar and analyst Shadi Hamid believes Ukraine might serve as a wake-up call for the generation that, like him, came of age amid the fallout of 9/11. Those years left him “lukewarm and ambivalent” about US hard power, he told me this week, because he had seen it go so badly wrong, in Iraq most egregiously. The legacy of 9/11 was a preference, among American progressives at least, for “nice, fluffy things like soft power”. After Ukraine, Hamid predicts, that will change. A new generation is seeing that in order to stand up to a murderous dictator who opposes everything they believe in – from minority rights to free expression – sometimes only force will do. In other words, this latest paradigm shift is already undoing the impact of the last one. Of course, these are very early days. The war in Ukraine will bring yet more cruelty, yet more blood. But this invasion has provoked a reaction that its architect did not predict: a western resolve that not only must Putin be stopped in Ukraine, Putinism must be defeated. It is a determination fiercer than any since 2001. This battle matters more than that one – which is why it must not re-enact its follies and must not repeat its mistakes.

3/12/2022,"After the deployments, the denials and the diplomacy came the invasion and, with it, a war that was thoroughly foretold and yet still shocking in its savagery. A war with no rules, no limits and no quarter. The first two weeks of the conflict – a fortnight for observers but a cold eternity for the people of Ukraine – have already yielded countless disturbing images even as Europe, a continent with a short memory, pinches itself raw to make sure that what should not, and could not, ever happen here again really is happening here again.

Photograph: Wolfgang Schwan/Anadolu Agency For all their dreadful novelty, the photographs from Kyiv, from Kharkiv, from Irpin and from Mariupol stir memories of Guernica in 1937, of London in the blitz, and of Sarajevo under siege. Fresher still are the memories of Russia’s dress rehearsal in Syria. At dawn on Thursday 24 February, Vladimir Putin announced his long-dreaded invasion, or, as he put it in a phrase destined for the annals of martial euphemism, “a special military operation”.

Less than an hour after the Russian president vowed to bring about “the demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine”, the country found itself under full-scale attack. Sirens sounded as explosions rippled through Ukraine’s cities, tanks rolled into its territories and helicopters strafed homes outside the capital. A mother and child try to sleep in the Kyiv subway, being used as a bomb shelter, on 24 February. Photograph: Emilio Morenatti/AP Missiles and shells, apparently targeting infrastructure near major cities including Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mariupol, Dnipro and Odesa, killed hundreds of civilians and transformed blocks of flats into shattered and smoking ruins. People grabbed blankets and sleeping bags – as well as toys and colouring books to distract their children – and hurried into shelters or underground stations. When they emerged, many found their homes gone, damaged beyond repair, or hidden by curtains of flame and smoke. The scale, swiftness and mercilessness of the first stage of the destruction were captured in two pictures that were used around the world.

Mariupol’s deputy mayor, Sergiy Orlov, said the words “bombardment” and “cruelty” did not come close to describing what was going on in the city, whose residents are trying to flee at the rate of 2,000 to 3,000 a day.

3/12/2022,"It may be a city more famous for its canaries, but in Norwich there is another more substantial bird that has been delighting birdwatchers and startling joggers in recent weeks. His name is Alfie – a Eurasian eagle owl, one of the largest species in the world that is not native to Britain. In one of the most recent sightings, Alfie took Hattie Atkinson Smith by surprise on Monday as she jogged near Carrow Road stadium, home to Norwich City football club, AKA the Canaries. “I felt something on the back of my head, like fingers. I thought it was a person, pushing their hand down over my head,” she says. “I looked up, and there was this absolutely ginormous bird.” Startled but unhurt, Atkinson Smith watched the bird fly away and land on an apartment balcony. “I could tell it was a bird of prey, but I thought it was too big to be an owl … I got a really good look at it.” Atkinson Smith, a data-science manager, later identified the bird on Google as a Eurasian eagle owl. The birds are easily recognised by their striking orange eyes and tufted ears, as well as their size – weighing up to 4kg, with a wingspan of nearly 2 metres. Norwich Evening News has been reporting regularly on sightings of “Norwich’s favourite bird of prey” and was this week able to explain the bird’s backstory. Alfie’s owner, Peter Murphy, told the newspaper that he had been caring for Alfie for four years before the bird was accidentally let loose from his aviary in Lakenham in 2020. Murphy said he hopes to recapture his much-loved pet, but urged city folk not to approach the owl “unless you have a very long net”. “He is a very dangerous bird in the wrong hands,” he explained. But Chris Sperring, the Hawk and Owl Trust conservation officer, says Alfie has been loose long enough to resist giving up his freedom. “I think its chances in the wild are pretty darn good.” Eurasian eagle owls are no longer native to Britain, meaning no records are kept of their numbers in captivity, but escaped pets have been known to thrive in the wild and even breed. There is also speculation that the birds may reach Britain from continental Europe, where wild populations have returned. But the chances of Alfie finding love in Norwich, Sperring suggests, are remote – which may be behind his recent high profile, swooping pedestrians and waking people up with loud hooting at 2am. “It’s fuelled up, its hormones are running high because of the wonderful Norfolk diet, and it’s saying ‘Where are you? Why aren’t you answering me? Come on!’” says Sperring. Alfie’s encounter with Atkinson Smith may have even been an attempt to initiate pair-bonding (not to mate, Sperring clarifies, “unless he’s presenting food to the jogger”). “He’s going to what he knows, and that’s people.” In February 2015, a Gloucester woman broke her arm while running away from an overeager eagle owl. But Sperring says Alfie is unlikely to pose a threat to any Norwich residents larger than a squirrel. As the apex owl species, eagle owls are often depicted as “hyped-up super owls”, Sperring says, “but when you’re actually up close, you realise there’s an awful lot of feathers.” Atkinson Smith has since been for runs on Carrow Road without further encounters with Alfie. “It’s not a dangerous bird, it obviously just confused me for something smaller,” she says. “I’ve just been keeping my head up.”",News/Environment,He swoops to conquer: hormonal owl livens up Norfolk nights,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/11/he-swoops-to-conquer-hormonal-owl-livens-up-norfolk-nights
3/12/2022,"British American Tobacco has reversed its decision to continue selling cigarettes and other nicotine products in Russia, putting the sudden change of heart down to its “ethos and values”. The owner of brands including Rothmans and Lucky Strike said it would pull out of Russia after all, two days after breaking ranks with companies such as Nestlé, Unilever, Coca-Cola and McDonald’s by refusing to quit its operations there. A string of big corporations have halted operations in Russia as part of the global response to the invasion of Ukraine but BAT had previously said that, while it would scale back some of its activities, it would not stop selling its products. On Friday afternoon, the London-based company said it would go further. “Building on our announcement of 9 March 2022, we have now completed the review of our presence in Russia,” said BAT. “The context is highly complex, exceptionally fast-moving and volatile. “We have concluded that BAT’s ownership of the business in Russia is no longer sustainable in the current environment. “Today, we have initiated the process to rapidly transfer our Russian business in full compliance with international and local laws. Beyond continuing to pay our 2,500 employees, we will do our utmost to safeguard their future employment. “Upon completion, BAT will no longer have a presence in Russia.” Russia has said it plans to seize the assets of western companies leaving the country. On Thursday the country’s economic ministry said it could take temporary control of departing businesses where foreign ownership exceeds 25%. Vladimir Putin said the Kremlin could find legally viable ways to seize international firms. The government would push to “introduce external management and then transfer these enterprises to those who actually want to work,” Putin said. Announcing its abrupt U-turn, BAT said the company prided itself on “our values and our ethos”. Russia is named as a key growth market for both cigarettes and heated tobacco in BAT’s annual report and the company said the war and its decision to leave the market would have an impact on its finances. Ukraine and Russia account for 3% of BAT’s revenues and a smaller proportion of profits, it said. As a result, revenues are likely to increase this year by between 2% and 4%, a slight downwards revision compared to its previous estimate of 3% to 5%.",News/Business,British American Tobacco halts Russia sales after U-turn,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/11/british-american-tobacco-halts-russia-sales-after-u-turn

Whether Cristiano Ronaldo experienced such dizzying highs, terrifying lows and chocolate-covered wafery middles during his recent trip to his homeland remains to be seen but Ralf Rangnick was today asked about it all again and refused to clarify whether he and Manchester United were aware of the jaunt. “No, because it doesn’t make sense to look back on what was happening in the last six or seven days,” he said, clicking unsubscribe on his weekly copy of The Recap. “For me, it’s important what is happening today and tomorrow.

3/12/2022,"Rich Russians are exploiting a loophole known as the “Serbian backdoor” to flee to Europe and circumnavigate an EU-wide ban on flights to and from Russia. Air Serbia, which is mostly state-owned, has doubled the number of direct flights from Moscow to Belgrade to 15 a week to meet rapidly rising demand after the EU banned Russian planes and airlines from its airspace, after Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia responded by closing its airspace to EU and UK planes. Serbia is not a member of the EU and has refused to impose sanctions against Russia, but its planes are free to cross EU airspace. This has made the Balkan country “the only European air corridor left open to Russia”, according to travel analytics company ForwardKeys. Airline seat capacity between Russia and Serbia increased by 50% in the first week of March compared with the week before Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, ForwardKeys said. Capacity is set to be increased further still in coming weeks, according to the company. “What’s most notable is the speed with which Serbia has become the gateway for travel between Russia and Europe,” said Olivier Ponti, ForwardKeys’ vice-president of insights. Russian arriving in Serbia are travelling on to Europe, with the top onward destinations being Cyprus, France, Switzerland and Italy. Russians are also traveling to the UK, Slovenia, Austria, Germany and Spain. At the time of writing there was just one business class seat left on a flight leaving on Saturday from Moscow to Belgrade, costing £583, and no economy class seats.",News/Business,Wealthy Russians using Serbian loophole to avoid EU flights ban,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/11/wealthy-russians-using-air-serbia-loophole-to-avoid-eu-flights-ban
3/12/2022,"A supertanker carrying crude oil that sailed from a Russian port was due to dock in Southampton on Friday with cargo destined for an ExxonMobil refinery. The Seatribute is one of 148 tankers carrying oil and gas that have left Russian ports since Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine began 14 days ago, according to data on shipping movements gathered by Greenpeace. The marine tracking data reveals that 69 of the tankers that have sailed from Russian ports are on their way to Europe. Grant Shapps has said Russian vessels will be banned from UK ports in an effort to ensure the Kremlin is not funding its war effort with sales of oil and gas in the UK. But the transport secretary’s ban covers vessels owned, controlled, operated or chartered by anyone connected with Russia and any vessel flying the Russian flag or registered in Russia. The Seatribute is registered in Malta. It left the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk at 01.27 on 23 February, according to maritime data. It was due to dock at Southampton on Friday afternoon. Greenpeace is tracking supertankers carrying fossil fuels that have left Russia since the war began, using shipping data to monitor their movements. ExxonMobil, which owns the refinery in Fawley where the oil on Seatribute is destined to go, denied it was Russian oil. The company said the oil was from Kazakhstan, and had been transported via the Caspian pipeline. The pipeline transports the bulk of Kazakhstan’s oil exports through southern Russia to the oil terminal at Novorossiysk. But about 10% of the oil that passes through the pipeline comes from oilfields in the Russian sector of the Caspian, which is blended with the Kazakh crude. The pipeline is part-owned by Russia. ExxonMobil said in a statement: “No ExxonMobil equity crude that is transported via the Caspian pipeline en route to the US or Europe is from Russia. The Caspian pipeline delivers oil and gas from Kazakhstan and is not subject to sanctions at this time.” Several tankers have left Russian oil and gas ports for the UK since 24 February, according to the Greenpeace tracker. Some have been redirected, but others appear to still be on the way to Britain. Last Friday – just days after Shapps announced a ban on Russian oil and gas tankers docking in UK ports – dockers refused to unload a tanker of Russian gas due to arrive at a Thames estuary port. Shapps’s veto contains a loophole: it does not cover the origin of the cargo, and only applies to Russian-owned, or Russian-flagged ships. Rosie Rogers, the head of energy at Greenpeace UK, said: “Our dependence on oil and gas is still fuelling Putin’s war. If ministers are serious about putting a stop to that, then we need to see firmer action on blocking fossil fuel imports from Russia. We hope our tracker will be a useful tool to anyone who wants to monitor where Putin’s oil and gas are turning up.” The UK relies on Russia for 5% of its gas imports and 8% of oil imports. Earlier this week the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, pledged to phase out the import of Russian oil by the end of the year. Shell had to apologise last week for exploiting the conflict to buy Russian crude oil last weekend at a discounted price. A spokesperson for Associated British Ports said: “Following the government’s legislation barring Russian vessels from UK ports, we are working closely with colleagues in the Department for Transport and other government agencies to ensure that all vessels entering our ports are fully compliant with this law.”",News/World news,Oil supertanker from Russian port to dock in Southampton,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/oil-supertanker-from-russian-port-to-dock-in-southampton-seatribute-malta-exxonmobil
3/12/2022,"Samantha Bee looked for ways to help the worst refugee crisis in Europe since the second world war on the latest episode of Full Frontal, as more than 2 million Ukrainians have fled the Russian invasion of their country. “All of this suffering can be laid at the manicured feet of one deranged man baby who’s been waiting for this moment since the early 90s,” she said on Thursday evening of the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin. “Back then, Putin was sad that the Soviet Union broke up, so like many children of divorce, this lonely little 39-year-old boy refused to accept it,” she continued. “For years, Putin has dreamed of getting the empire back together in one big-ass geopolitical parent trap, and he sees Ukraine as a vital piece. “So now, a nation of 44 million is suffering because Putin can’t move on from something that happened way back when Color Me Badd ruled the world.” dfx of the Ukrainian refugees are women and children, who are “so brave”, said Bee. “And I mean actually brave, not #brave, like when a hot mom posts a picture of herself in a bikini. “This humanitarian nightmare is exactly what Putin wants, and he shows no signs of backing down,” Bee said. She praised the internationally coordinated efforts of economic sanctions and business closures, “but hurting Putin isn’t enough. We also have to help the people whose lives he’s destroying.” Bee called on the Biden administration to take unilateral actions such as increasing the number of refugees the US admits from Ukraine and allowing people facing urgent humanitarian need to stay in the US without a visa. “But the most important thing we can all do is care about refugees, from Ukraine and from everywhere else,” she concluded. “There’s no good outcomes for anyone here, including Russia,” Seth Meyers said on Thursday’s Late Night, of the war in Ukraine. Which is why Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in an interview with Vice News that dialogue was the only way to stop the conflict. “That’s really incredible – even a guy who’s being hunted by one of the world’s most barbaric autocrats still believes in the power of dialogue,” Meyers said of the interview. “And let’s not forget: this guy who is now courageously leading his people in defense of their homeland was once Ukraine’s top comedian. Which makes it even more incredible, because the comedians I know do not believe in dialogue. They believe in monologue. “If even Zelenskiy still believes in the power of dialogue, then the rest of us should, too,” he added. “Because he’s right: that’s the only way this horrific conflict can end. Reckless escalation will only make things worse, which is why irresponsible GOP politicians and pundits need to stop floating crazy ideas that would only heighten tension between nuclear powers.” Such as former president Donald Trump, who told a crowd of Republican donors over the weekend that the US should put the Chinese flag on F-22 jets and “bomb the shit out of Russia” in retribution for its invasion of Ukraine. Meyers discouraged viewers from seeing the remarks as flippant, or a joke. “A lot of us assumed that he was joking when he said he was going to run for president because, you know, he was a famously broke game show idiot,” he said. “But Trump is always joking until he’s not. He’s like a husband pitching a three-way to his wife and her best friend.” On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert celebrated news that the Russian warship told to “go fuck yourself” at Snake Island had been destroyed. “So it may not have done exactly what the Ukrainians wanted, but it did go down on itself,” Colbert said to audience cheers. “The failure of the vaunted Russian war machine to overwhelm the much smaller Ukraine has shocked the world,” he continued. And they appear to be plagued by extensive military problems; according to the New York Times, some Russian troops crossed the border into Ukraine with MREs (meals ready to eat) that expired in 2002. “It’s never a good sign when your dinner is old enough to enlist,” Colbert joked. The Russians also appear to be low on fuel, which would help explain why their giant convoy remains stuck in a column about 20 miles outside of Kyiv and has barely moved in a week. “They’re stuck in a tank conga line,” Colbert joked. And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah debriefed the internet firestorm over comments Kim Kardashian made in an interview with Variety. “I have the best advice for women in business: get your fuckin’ ass up and work,” she said. “It seems like nobody wants to work these days.” “I know a lot of people are pissed off at Kim. But if I’m being perfectly honest, I can see this thing from both sides,” said Noah. On Kim’s side, “she’s like, ‘You guys think I just take a few pictures and I got to a few events and then suddenly I’m rich and famous and you think it’s easy, but it’s not easy. And I understand that. Kim does a lot of work. She grinds all the time, she’s a shrewd businesswoman, and she’s a mom to Kanye and the kids. “But part of this idea that people have of Kim is Kim’s fault,” he continued. “I mean think about it: for decades, the thing that she sold is not work. In fact, she works really hard to look like she’s not working hard. Every photo of Instagram she’s either on a beach, or in a pool, or in a hot tub.” But what Kardashian doesn’t seem to understand, Noah added, is that “it can come off as extremely condescending to tell women that the reason they’re not successful is because they’re too lazy to get off their asses and actually work. Because yes, Kim Kardashian works hard. But you know who else works hard? Most women. But what their asses don’t have is Kim’s luck to be born into a rich family.”",Arts/Culture,Samantha Bee on Putin: ‘All of this suffering can be laid at the manicured feet of one deranged man-baby’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/11/samantha-bee-putin-late-night-tv
