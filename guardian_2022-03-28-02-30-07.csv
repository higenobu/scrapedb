3/28/2022,"When academies were introduced 20 years ago, they were intended to improve the performance of schools and their students, by setting them free of local authority control – a proposition that has become embedded within the secondary education sector. However, it now seems that many of these businesses have gone the way of formerly publicly owned services such as water companies, in which executive pay and shareholder dividends take precedence over water quality (MPs accuse DfE of failing to control academy leaders’ excessive salaries, 25 March). High salaries are frequently justified by reference to “market forces”; such a specious claim cannot be made where the comparators are their erstwhile colleagues in neighbouring schools that have not sought or gained academy status. Academies which have overstretched themselves by paying executive directors and their retinue unsustainable salaries and benefits should not be bailed out with public money.Les BrightExeter, Devon  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

3/28/2022,"Last week saw a good day for press freedom. An Old Bailey judge ruled that Chris Mullin, the former Labour minister and journalist, would not have to hand over the notes that he made while looking a decade later into the 1974 IRA Birmingham pub bombings. The West Midlands police had applied for an order under terror laws to force Mr Mullin to reveal the sources for his 1986 book, Error of Judgement, and the television documentaries he later worked on. He declined to do so, and the court backed him. This was the right decision. Protection of journalists’ sources is a cornerstone of the free press in a democracy. Mr Mullin had, through years of patient digging, exposed significant and important failures by the police that resulted in the wrongful conviction and imprisonment of six innocent men. To prove the guilty men were free, Mr Mullin had to find out who they were. To discover this, he had to give assurances that he would not reveal his sources. The court heard that one bomber had confessed to Mr Mullin and that he had notes from speaking to another alleged bomber. Without giving his word to former members of the IRA, it is hard to see how this miscarriage of justice would have been overturned. The relatives of the victims of the attack deserve sympathy and understanding. The bombs planted by the IRA in two Birmingham pubs killed 21 people. More than 200 were injured, some of whose lives would never be the same again. None of those responsible have been brought to justice. Mr Mullin did voluntarily give the police some redacted notes, but drew a line when officers demanded more. While the judge, Mark Lucraft QC, said he had “reasonable grounds for believing” Mr Mullin’s notebooks were “likely to be of substantial value” to police, he found in Mr Mullin’s favour. This judgment reaffirms the role of the media as a public watchdog in a democratic society. If journalists were compelled to reveal their sources, it would be much more difficult for them to obtain information and to inform the public of serious matters. A not dissimilar judgment was reached by Northern Ireland’s lord chief justice in 2020 when he quashed police warrants used to search journalists’ homes and workplaces. Mr Mullin’s work had profound effects on the police. Not only was the notorious West Midlands serious crime squad disbanded, but at least 30 other convictions were quashed. His victory last week is a reminder that journalism must be protected from the baleful gaze of power. Journalists are, as a profession, not always held in the highest of regard. But the best among them take huge risks to expose corruption, hypocrisy or deception in high places. Reporters’ work, prior to the recognition of such wrongdoing, is not always appreciated – especially by those who have an interest in letting sleeping dogs lie. Our present media landscape has no shortage of critical opinions. Rarer is it to find pursuers of inconvenient facts. When one comes along, as was the case with Mr Mullin, journalism must be suffered by those in authority so that freedom of expression and the right of the public to know are preserved.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on public interest: democracy rests on a free press | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/27/the-guardian-view-on-public-interest-democracy-rests-on-a-free-press

3/28/2022,"There are three months of the season still to go but Leicester remain firmly in the domestic box seat. A quietly impressive victory in Devon has already clinched their place in the playoffs and there was the added bonus of two tries for the former England wing Chris Ashton who is now the joint highest scorer in Premiership history. The Tigers have had some lean hunting days in Devon in recent years but there could be no disputing their first win at this venue since 2014. They led for all but the first seven minutes of the contest and were too well organised and strong in defence and at the set pieces for an error-prone Exeter side whose resources continue to be stretched by injuries to key players. No one is suggesting the outcome would have been different had Luke Cowan-Dickie, Jack Nowell, Johnny Hill, Stuart Hogg and Sam Skinner all been on the field but the fourth-placed Chiefs are going to have to find another gear or two if these two teams do end up meeting again in the Premiership playoffs in June. Despite the loss of George Ford who limped off in the first half with a damaged ankle, Leicester had the answers to almost every west country question. The Chiefs did at least try to mount a grandstand finish from 19-0 down but despite enjoying plenty of possession they mostly encountered an east midlands brick wall. If Steve Borthwick fancies succeeding Eddie Jones as England’s head coach after the 2023 World Cup, the defensive appetite and energy that his side displayed here was another good advertisement for his technical skills and motivational ability. It also helps to have players as effective as Julian Montoya in and around the breakdown while Ashton, if not the game’s dominant figure, remains as reliable a try sniffer as ever. Having been thrown a career lifeline by Borthwick after leaving Worcester, he now sits level with Tom Varndell on top of the all-time Premiership list with 92 tries. “I’ve been wanting to score tries spent since the age of five, so it would be nice to leave it behind,” said Ashton afterwards, admitting he would love to retire with the record safely bagged. “But having spent time at home thinking that was it, I’m just grateful to be back out here playing and enjoying it.” Ashton, who turns 35 on Tuesday, already had his first try of the day on the board before Exeter had stitched a single phase together. With advantage being played Ford floated a beautifully floated chip towards the right corner and Ashton barely had to move to gather and touch down for No 91, taking him above Sale’s Mark Cueto. Against the breeze, Exeter, though, showed the odd promising flash and a hint of Leicester frustration began to surface. Back in December the referee Luke Pearce repeatedly marched Saracens’s Billy Vunipola backwards for dissent and he continued his crusade here, most notably when he punished Dan Kelly for hurling the ball down in frustration. If Chiefs were starting to believe their optimism was about to be abruptly extinguished. Jacques Vermuelen stuck out an instinctive hand in an effort to make an interception and referee Pearce, having been alerted by his assistants, duly waved a yellow card despite the flanker’s fulsome apologies. Suddenly the initiative was back with Leicester and a couple of attacking box kicks from Ben Youngs found space in the home 22. Exeter wriggled out of trouble first time around but were less fortunate when Youngs second crafty chip again bounced higher than Olly Woodburn was expecting and allowed the tall Freddie Steward to jump, collect and score a try that further shifted the momentum. Exeter also allowed an opportunity to slip away just before the interval when Ashton lifted Jack Innard’s legs in the tackle and conceded a very kickable penalty in easy range of the posts. Instead the Chiefs opted to kick to the corner but Dave Ewers, having advanced further than he expected, was held up over the line to keep the Tigers’ line intact. It was doubly painful for the home side, then, when Ashton seized on a loose pass by Ian Whitten after 46 minutes and outpaced the cover to put his side clear. Ewers and Patrick Schickerling did claw back consolation tries but Exeter may now need to win all four of their remaining games to make the playoffs. “It was one of those games where we weren’t good enough,” said Rob Baxter, Exeter’s director of rugby. “We are definitely in a fight now but the bonus point could be very important.” ",Sport/Sport,Ashton equals record as Leicester make playoffs with victory at Exeter,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/27/ashton-equals-record-as-leicester-make-playoffs-with-victory-at-exeter
3/28/2022,"Grant Shapps is writing to the chief executive of P&O Ferries urging him to announce a U-turn on the decision to sack 800 workers without notice, as unions pledged to “ratchet up the fight” after a weekend of protests. The transport secretary is expected to present a package of legislation on Wednesday to close existing loopholes and ensure ferry companies running regular services to and from the British isles pay their crew the UK minimum wage. Government officials are understood to be meeting with rival operators Stena Line and DFDS on Monday to discuss the legislation, along with measures to tackle possible Easter travel chaos if services remain disrupted. Fresh demonstrations against the sackings are planned for this week, with the RMT union turning its attention to P&O Ferries’ supply chain, including the maritime agencies involved with recruiting workers. The union said there would be a protest outside the Glasgow offices of Clyde Marine Recruitment – which describes itself as Europe’s leading supplier of marine personnel – on Monday morning. Demonstrations took place in Liverpool, Dover and Hull on Saturday as the outcry over P&O Ferries’ decision to sack its crews and replace them with cheaper foreign workers. The firm’s chief executive, Peter Hebblethwaite, last week admitted that it broke the law by dismissing the workers without consultation. He told a Commons hearing on Thursday: “There’s absolutely no doubt we were required to consult with the unions. We chose not to do that.” It is understood Shapps will write to Hebblethwaite to say there is still time for the firm to reconsider its strategy,and it may as well act because otherwise the government will force its hand. Following calls from MPs and others for emergency action to be taken, the transport minister has pledged new legislation designed to make sure ferries using UK ports observe the national minimum wage, which is currently £8.91 an hour, rising to £9.50 on 1 April. Meanwhile, a P&O Ferries source told the PA news agency that it conducted a study last year into options, which calculated it would cost £309m to keep the business going through a consultation period of at least three months, costs which would have seriously undermined the business and possibly dealt a fatal blow. The RMT’s general secretary, Mick Lynch, has already called for the government to seize P&O’s fleet of ships, and for crew who were sacked without being consulted or given any notice to be reinstated. Lynch said on Sunday: “There will be more protests, more campaigning and more political pressure this week as we ratchet up the fight and harness the public anger at the jobs carve-up on our ferries.” He claimed there would be “nowhere to run and nowhere to hide” for those involved. On Sunday, P&O Ferries said it was “unable to run some of our services over the next few days”. As of Sunday afternoon, sailings from Dover to Calais were cancelled up to and including Thursday 31 March, while those between Larne and Cairnryan in Scotland remained suspended. Monday’s service between Rotterdam and Hull has also been cancelled. The government is subjecting all P&O ferries to inspections before allowing them back into service. One ship, the European Causeway, was impounded in Northern Ireland on Friday by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, after being deemed “unfit to sail” after an inspection found “failures on crew familiarisation, vessel documentation and crew training”. At the moment passengers due to travel on some routes such as Dover to Calais are typically being advised by P&O Ferries that “we will get you away on an alternative carrier” such as DFDS, though it is unclear what will happen if rivals are fully booked, as may be the case over Easter.",News/Business,Grant Shapps urges P&O Ferries to U-turn on sacking of 800 workers,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/27/grant-shapps-urges-po-to-u-turn-on-sacking-of-800-workers
3/28/2022,"The Morrison government will use Tuesday’s budget to unveil a multi-billion dollar national infrastructure spend that includes projects in key marginal seats, with $17.9bn in new money to be spent over the next decade. The pre-election cash splash on road and rail also includes projects for regional Australia that had been secured in negotiations with the Nationals, including $140m for a regional road safety program and $678m for the Outback Way, announced by deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce last month in the key NT marginal seat of Lingiari. The largest new spending commitment is $3.1bn for the Melbourne Intermodal Terminal in Victoria, which will go towards two new freight terminals and road infrastructure designed to service inland rail. This is in addition to $2bn announced in last year’s budget for the project. In New South Wales, the government has committed $2.4bn towards new projects and $804m in additional commitments for existing projects. This includes $8m towards planning the duplication of the New England Highway between Muswellbrook and Singleton. The Shoalhaven City Council in the key marginal seat of Gilmore will receive an extra $352m for the Milton Ulludulla bypass. Passenger rail projects will also receive a significant boost, with $1.6bn being announced for the Brisbane to the Sunshine Coast rail extension, $1.2bn for the Brisbane to Gold Coast rail upgrade, and $1bn for the Sydney to Newcastle faster rail upgrade. In Western Australia, where the government has up to five seats at risk of falling to Labor, the budget will include $145m for upgrades to the Tonkin highway and $140m for regional road spending. Tasmania, where the government is hoping to sandbag two marginal seats in the north of the state, will receive $336m for a northern roads package, while the marginal seat of Boothby in South Australia will benefit from $200m for Marion Road along with already announced spending on South Road. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the infrastructure package was aimed at “keeping Australians moving and supporting thousands of local jobs across the country.” “By investing in these projects we are delivering the infrastructure that the Australian economy needs to grow, to get Australians home sooner and safer, and generate thousands of jobs and new opportunities for small businesses right across the country,” Morrison said. The deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce said the development of freight routes was needed to drive the growth of industries that generated “the wealth our nation needs to become as strong as possible as quickly as possible.” “Getting more commodities to ports and sending them overseas will generate more export income, making our nation wealthier and stronger. Better roads and infrastructure will enable that.” The budget is already benefiting from soaring commodity prices, with the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg indicating on Sunday that Tuesday’s budget would see a significant improvement in the budget bottom line. Key elements of the budget have already been revealed, including tax relief for small and medium sized business, health spending, an extension of an apprenticeship wage subsidy scheme and more money for defence and veterans. The centrepiece of the budget will be a cost of living relief package targeting low and middle income earners, which is expected to include a one-off cash payment and a cut to fuel excise that is currently set at 44 cents a litre. A $250 cash payment for pensioners is also on the cards. Frydenberg has been cool on the idea of extending or increasing the low and middle income tax offset, however, with the treasurer emphasising that the payment was only ever intended to be temporary. In its pre budget analysis, Deloitte Access Economics said that the potential injection of $8bn from the Lmito would trigger action by the Reserve Bank to quell the inflationary consequences, requiring an increase in the cash rate of 0.3 percentage points. Inflation is already on track to be as high as 5% this year, with wage growth lagging behind. However, Tuesday’s budget is expected to revise upwards its notoriously inaccurate wage growth projections on the back of record low unemployment. On Sunday, Morrison said the government would continue to have an eye on inflation as it looked to help households out with cost of living relief, saying the Coalition would spend in a way that did not hike up inflation and interest rates. “We will continue to tackle inflation through strong financial management that we have demonstrated,” Morrison said. “This budget once again is about Australians – the pressures they face, the cost of living pressures that they’re having to deal with. To guarantee the essential services that they rely on, to ensure that we can keep them safe (and) that we can support the defence forces that secure our position in a very volatile Indo-Pacific region.” Labor’s shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, argued that the government needed to be investing in productivity measures to ensure that the budget spend did not lead to inflationary pressures that would ultimately hurt households. However, the opposition is unlikely to stand in the way of any cost of living relief for families, with Chalmers saying Labor was broadly supportive of a temporary cut to the fuel excise.",News/Australia news,Coalition unveils $17.9bn pre-election cash splash on road and rail projects,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/28/coalition-unveils-179bn-pre-election-cash-splash-on-road-and-rail-projects
3/28/2022,"There couldn’t have been a band better prepared to meet a global health crisis than Camp Cope. Since their inception the Melbourne trio have weathered health and mental health issues – including the death of loved ones, and singer Georgia Maq’s vocal surgery – so they “adapted really quickly” to Covid, bassist Kelly-Dawn Hellmrich says. She doesn’t mean it lightly: Maq is now a full-time nurse who administered jabs throughout the lockdowns. She got her qualification years ago but, “When the band started I wanted to work in a pub and be cool. Then the pandemic happened, and I was like, well, they need nurses right now so if I don’t do it I’m a bad person.” When we meet in a Fitzroy beer garden, Maq, Hellmrich and drummer Sarah Thompson are all wearing masks. While their collective image remains punk rock scruff, tattoo doodles and a coiled potency, Camp Cope are forever analysing their place in the world and their duty within it. Upon the release of their third album, their priorities have entirely shifted. The result is an album that shakes off the tough facade. Running With the Hurricane is golden and soulful, tender and huge-hearted, compared with the unvarnished fury that’s dominated their past work – such as 2018’s The Opener, a rallying cry against gendered inequality in the music industry. “We all three had the idea that we don’t want this to be the yelly, angry album, we want this to be a beautiful album,” Thompson says. “But I’m still hitting the drums very hard.” Maq adds: “I just don’t write that way any more. I’m done. I’m like, you can’t yell at shit forever. It’ll kill you.” For me, Weyes Blood’s benevolently sage 2019 album Titanic Rising (with its overriding message “a lot’s gonna change”) became the perfect soundtrack to the uncertain times, and Camp Cope’s latest could be the bookend: its theme, as described in the album bio, is of breaking through to the other side of a storm. The bio could be alluding to the “media storms” that I’ve been asked by the publicist not to get specific about in my questions – among them calling out festivals for booking too few women, and spearheading the It Takes One campaign to make festivals safer – but it also works as a theme for the times. The album title sums that up. “Running with the hurricane” is a line from a 1986 song by Maq’s father’s band, Redgum. “I don’t even understand what theirs is about – I think it’s about the war, smoking too much pot,” Maq says. “I just applied it to my own life. Life is chaos. You can get swept up in it or you can become as chaotic as it is.” As well as adapting to fate, there are tales of masochistic love affairs and jealousy; the bloody enjoyment of poking a bruise. But politics are absent. “In the last two years, everything is political,” Thompson reasons. “This album is actually a little break from that. And then outside of music we can all just keep yelling at politicians, I suppose.” For the first time, the band worked with a female producer, Anna Laverty. They brought in guests Shauna Boyle of Cable Ties and Courtney Barnett, and branched out into piano, which Maq had been experimenting with. Often there are backing vocals that act as a Greek chorus, including in Say the Line: “I wanna kiss you in my own way (What does that even mean?).” Maq’s vocals are alternately anguished and joyful, and on the occasions she barely reaches the lowest notes it only amps up the passion. Taking time out proved good for the band. In 2020 Maq put out an electronic solo album, Pleaser, and taught herself to produce and engineer. Hellmrich moved back home to western Sydney and got a job at a music merchandising company – and as “Kelso” she dropped a solo EP in 2019. “It was never supposed to add anything to my music career,” she says. “It was more just for my own mental health. I think making art is something that everyone should do, whether you want it to be your job or not. It’s like, not everyone can be a professional athlete, but you should still move your body.” In April Camp Cope will tour Australia for the first time in four years – exhibiting cautious optimism after two years of cancellations. “We’re still in the midst of it but I think eventually it won’t be a ‘better or worse’, it’ll just be different,” Thompson says of playing shows again. “We’ve got to think of new ways to do this now because the fact is it’s not the same world as it was two years ago. So we’ll evolve, I suppose.” Hellmrich doesn’t mourn her old lifestyle. “I just look back on how lucky we were to see so much of the world,” she says. “It’s always been an unstable career, to work in the arts, and now the pandemic has brought that to the public attention. People can see how little support musicians and artists get.” Thompson adds: “At the end of the day it’s a pandemic. People have died. If we don’t play a show it isn’t that important in the grand scheme of the world.” Camp Cope’s Running With the Hurricane is out now through Poison City Records",Arts/Music,Camp Cope find a gentler side: ‘You can’t yell at shit forever.

3/28/2022,"Property developers in New South Wales are fighting against the introduction of a wide-ranging planning policy aimed at ensuring houses are more energy-efficient and climate-resilient, which one environment group described as “everything you could ever dream about”. Public comment closed last month on the draft Design and Place state environmental planning policy, hailed late last year by the then planning minister Rob Stokes as “NSW’s first comprehensive design policy”. It would offer “an important opportunity to reshape the look and feel of the places we live in”. The policy included pushing for new commercial buildings to be net-zero carbon emissions from “day one”, apartment blocks to be built with electric vehicle charging stations and a required minimum tree cover for developments. The plan also required “comprehensive hazard risk profiles”, including floods and bushfires, for new developments. The demand has gained relevance in the aftermath of recent floods in Sydney and elsewhere in the state, with thousands of homes already approved to be built in flood plains. It was also one of the government’s key planks to achieve the state’s 2030 target of cutting carbon emissions by 50% from 2005 levels. Other elements include huge renewable energy zones to speed up the power industry’s decarbonisation and initiatives to get more electric vehicles on the road to shift transport off fossil fuels. However, Stokes was demoted soon after he released its draft and replaced by Anthony Roberts as the new planning and housing minister. Roberts’ office declined to provide a comment on the minister’s stance but it is understood he is not a supporter. Brett Whitworth, the deputy planning secretary, told NSW estimates earlier this month the draft planning policy had received more than 350 submissions. Asked if the department had been given any direction on the policy from the minister, he said, “no, we have not”. “[Roberts] made the point that he wanted to ensure that there was no impact on the ability to deliver homes and homes already in the pipeline,” Whitworth said. According to the government’s commissioned cost-benefit analysis, the policy would add costs of $2.3bn over 30 years but be outweighed by almost $3.3bn in benefits. Despite that assessment, the industry has objected. Luke Achterstraat, the Property Council’s NSW executive director, said the industry was “highly supportive of the objectives to create great places and deliver good design outcomes, which are essential to the long-term success and sustainable growth of our cities and regional areas”. “However, as a package the [policy] is not currently supported as it creates more subjectivity and uncertainty in already complex planning system,” he said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Steve Mann, the chief executive of the Urban Development Institute of Australia, said his organisation, too, was “supportive of a principles-based policy to improve design quality and environmental outcomes in NSW”, but called on the government to cancel the new planning policy. “[T]he approach taken … would have undermined the economics of delivering housing across the spectrum including social and affordable housing as well as private housing,” Mann said. “This would be a disaster for providing key worker housing, ie teachers, nurses, those on low income and disability housing.” Jeff Angel, the executive director of the Total Environment Centre, said it was clear the construction and housing industry groups were demanding the plan’s demise. “It’s so detailed, it’s incredible,” Angel said, noting planning had provided briefing points to environmental groups. “It’s got everything you could dream about. “It would affect every development in the state, not just Sydney,” Angel said, adding industry associations “talk the talk” about building sustainably “but nothing happens underneath”.

Housing “is a large emitting sector, and collectively, we have to deal with it in the future”, said Paul Scully, Labor’s shadow planning spokesperson, adding “an incredible amount of work had gone into it just for them to abandon it”. The Greens MP David Shoebridge said that after the last two years of extreme weather events driven by climate change, governments needed to be taking much stronger steps on reducing emissions. “We have already seen this government scrap rules on climate and fire readiness just weeks after they came into force, so, of course, we are all anxious,” Shoebridge said. “Even if these changes come into effect they will only reduce greenhouse emissions by 11% from business as usual and if we can’t meet that target then we are in a world of trouble on climate,” he said. The independent NSW MP Justin Field said that Roberts would leave “a terrible legacy” if he spiked the reforms without a credible replacement. “It is clear the only interests being served are those of the big property developers who will pocket any upfront cost savings while the ongoing costs will be paid by the community and households,” Field said. Residents would “suffer the loss of green space and be left with less climate-resilient homes that are more expensive to run and less comfortable to live in”. Davina Rooney, chief executive of the Green Building Council of Australia, said the organisation strongly supported the Sepp’s concepts. “Net zero, climate change, greener spaces are the key issues of our time,” Rooney said, adding the council had “collaborated heavily” with the government on the plan. Rooney noted Stokes, now the minister for infrastructure, addressed a recent council conference, saying the climate “would not wait for a convenient time in the economy”. “Our question in light of recent events [to scrap the Sepp] would be if now is not the right time, then when?” Rooney said.",News/Australia news,Property developers fight NSW bid to make houses more energy-efficient and climate-resilient,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/28/property-developers-fight-nsw-bid-to-make-houses-more-energy-efficient-and-climate-resilient
3/28/2022,"Social justice advocates are urging the Victorian government to prioritise a bill that would modernise legislation for dealing with an accused person deemed unfit to stand trial due to mental health issues or cognitive impairment. The bill was introduced by the former attorney general Jill Hennessy in 2020 but is yet to be debated by the parliament, and would amend the Crimes (Mental Impairment and Unfitness to be Tried) Act 1997. The bill was introduced after the Victorian ombudsman Deborah Glass in 2018 reported on a the case of a 39-year-old mentally impaired woman, which she said was the saddest she had ever investigated. The woman, known only as Rebecca to protect her identity, spent 18 months in a maximum security women’s prison locked in solitary confinement for up to 23 hours a day, screaming with distress for hours on end. If passed, the bill would improve the review process of indefinite supervision orders to include a more therapeutic approach and insert a statutory definition of mental impairment in the legislation. It would also improve the legislation’s interaction with the Mental Health Act and Disability Act to offer pathways for less restrictive orders. Uniting Church Australia’s senior social justice advocate Dr Mark Zirnsak urged the government to bring the bill on for debate. “We really need to see it passed and not leave this area unaddressed,” he told Guardian Australia. “We see significant impacts on people who are deemed unfit to stand trial, as highlighted in the case of 2018 by the Victorian ombudsman. To have this bill sitting around now for two years in the parliament is disappointing.” A Victorian government spokesperson said it was ensuring the bill was “still relevant and fit-for-purpose in the current landscape”. “These are important reforms and we’re ensuring we get this right,” they said. “This work is ongoing while we get on with progressing our significant wider legislative agenda.” Zirnsak said he hoped the Andrews government, which has made mental health reform a key policy pillar, would be “willing to move on this quickly for the benefit of people who are suffering from mental health issues and mental impairment”.He said the legislation would help prevent cases like Rebecca from arising again. Rebecca, who was charged with breaching an intervention order taken out by her family and for resisting police, was found unfit to stand trial and was not guilty because of mental impairment. The ombudsman’s report concluded she remained in prison simply because there was nowhere else for her to go. The judge in her case said she may have only been sentenced to a month in prison if she had pleaded guilty and been sentenced. Dr Chris Maylea, deputy chair of the Victorian Mental Illness Awareness Council and an associate professor of law at La Trobe University, said the council would welcome the reform, which would modernise the current act. He said the main area that needed urgent change was the introduction of better support services. “One of the things the bill is hoping to achieve is to integrate some of that support a bit more into the forensic systems,” he said. “If somebody can be supported, for example, within an NDIS package, then that should be taken into account a bit more.’” The act governs how people are treated by the justice system when they have a serious mental health issue or cognitive impairment that would deem them incapable of standing trial or being held criminally responsible for their offending. The act also oversees the regime for the supervision and management of this cohort to ensure they receive long-term treatment. A court can issue supervision orders under the act, and those on custodial orders are generally detained and supervised at the Thomas Embling hospital. Non-custodial orders allows treatment in the community. The orders are indefinite and can end only when the court deems it appropriate, taking into account risks to the community and treatment progression. Under Victorian law, people found unfit to stand trial due to mental impairment cannot be detained in prison unless there is no practicable alternative. But people declared liable for a custodial order are sometimes detained in prisons due to insufficient capacity at mental health or disability services. Lengthy wait times – sometimes up to nine months - triggered the Victorian government to last year announce a $350m funding package for Thomas Embling – run by government agency Forensicare – that would result in an additional 82 beds. In most circumstances, Forensicare supervises people with a mental illness under the act. A Forensicare spokesperson said it was currently overseeing 97 people on a custodial supervision order at Thomas Embling hospital. Additionally, seven people deemed liable for supervision under the act are awaiting an available bed at the facility.",News/Australia news,Calls for people with mental impairment to get more protections in Victoria’s justice system,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/28/calls-for-people-with-mental-impairment-to-get-more-protections-in-victorias-justice-system
3/28/2022,"Suicide is a topic that gets a lot of media airtime; however, not many people are able to talk about it in their personal lives with friends or family. This is not surprising, considering the nature of the topic and the stigma and helplessness that many people experience when talking about suicide. At this point in my career as a psychiatrist, I believe that almost everyone has been affected by a suicide or suicide attempt. You just have to ask. According to the World Health Organization, about 700,000 people die from suicide every year. In Australia, that equates to around nine deaths a day, with 65,000 people attempting suicide each year. As part of a psychiatric assessment, we ask our patients whether they are feeling suicidal or have made plans to end their lives. In the earlier years of my training, I was often surprised when people were relieved to be asked these questions and stated that no one had asked them this before. During the first year of my psychiatry training, I was working an evening shift when I received a call from the doctors in the emergency department to review Anna, a 19-year-old girl who had overdosed on pills. When asked if she had been suicidal previously, she told me about bullying and bulimia in high school three years prior. She had been at her lowest point at that time, and often thought about ending her life. Some people may be surprised by how long someone can think about ending their life without making any attempts. Somewhat reluctantly, Anna provided her parents’ contact number and they came to the hospital shortly after. Eventually, Anna was cleared to go home with her parents with a referral to see the community mental health team in the coming week. Patrick, her father, came to me separately and asked: “How can I stop this from ever happening again? What do we do now?” I knew what he wanted to hear, but couldn’t provide any answer that offered that certainty – the certainty that a parent would never receive a phone call from the hospital telling them that their child had attempted suicide. He had been aware that Anna had been struggling but had never expected that she would attempt to end her life. I gave Patrick some information sheets and emergency numbers he could use, but paper provides very little solace to worried parents. Even years into my training, there are few harrowing scenes that compare to parents leaving the hospital with a child who has had their first suicide attempt. Suicide awareness has increased over the years and has permeated our pop culture (13 Reasons Why) and social media (TikTok and Instagram). People are more comfortable with the idea that suicide is a major health concern. But this has not translated to people feeling more comfortable with bringing up the topic of suicide with a distressed person. If you have had a sibling, parent, or partner attempt to end their life then you might be able to bring up this difficult topic, but we need more people empowered to ask anyone who is struggling. Not everyone gets a second chance and the people most hurt by suicide are those who are left behind. My first psychiatrist supervisor once told me: “If you’re a psychiatrist long enough you will have your fair share of patients take their lives and there’s nothing you can do to change that.” My initial reaction was that of defiance, and I thought the mental health service could be doing more. Many doctors, for better or worse, have a saviour complex and feel helpless when they can’t help their patients, or lose a life under their care. With time, mental health services have continued to provide more education and support for people and families on mental health issues. Knowledge, destigmatisation and empowerment are fundamental tools for mental health services when engaging the public. Mr Ansari was a 64-year-old man who presented to our community mental health service with significant depression following the suicide of his only son, Omar, two years earlier. Omar had taken his life at the age of 30. Mr Ansari and his wife had divorced shortly after, partly due to his depression and mostly due to parental grief. Not all relationships can survive the death of a child. Burying your child is a specific type of traumatic grief with no easy roadmaps to acceptance. Mr Ansari had been admitted to a mental health ward due to increasing suicidal thoughts. He started on antidepressants and was referred to see a psychologist on discharge. The medications and therapy were effective and while he was no longer suicidal, I couldn’t help but think of him as a lonely, sad man. During a regular review, he brought up his son and we spoke about the final weeks of Omar life. Mr Ansari knew that his son had been struggling mentally and had one previous overdose in his early twenties. I asked Mr Ansari if he had ever spoken to his son about suicide. He became angry and said: “Isn’t that your job? How’s a parent meant to ask their child if they want to kill themselves?” A valid question and very commonly asked – mostly by fathers, I should add. I apologised and let him vent his frustration at mental health services. He eventually was able to be followed up by his GP and psychologist. I like to think we ended on good terms in later reviews, but I’ve never been able to ask him about that. A few years later, I asked a colleague what had happened to him and was told he had returned to Pakistan to be with his siblings as there was little left for him in Australia. The public often raise the question of who is the most qualified to ask questions around suicide. Anecdotally, many people would prefer if the “professionals” (GPs, psychologist, psychiatrists, nurses, etc) did this, which we are more than happy to. The question I ask is: If we all asked about suicide, wouldn’t that be better for everyone? I truly believe that more campaigns should centre around the destigmatisation of suicide and self-harm. This would involve the average person being able to begin discussions around suicide or self-harm in an open and non-judgmental manner. The goal would be for suicide to be talked about in the same way people talk about diabetes, heart attacks or strokes. If we reach a point where people can make mainstream jokes about suicide, then we would be close to the mark. We make jokes about several medical conditions (which kill people), but we find it uncomfortable to do the same with suicide. My point is not to be flippant – but the less taboo discussions around suicide are, the more likely people will feel comfortable talking about it. This might lead to earlier detection of significant mental distress or illness which could be a deciding factor in getting people into treatment earlier, with the idea of potentially reducing the chance of people ending their lives. When you open your web browser or turn on your TV screen, you will often come across a story of a person who has ended their life. We often feel helpless and empathise and then move on. Suppression is a coping strategy, after all. Instead, I want you to feel empowered to lean in and get educated and be able to ask the difficult questions or share your own experiences where appropriate. We need to talk about suicide.

3/28/2022,"Judgment Day has come for Hillsong – but not in the way its pastors promised. To recap a damning week for the church, its founder and global senior pastor, Brian Houston, has resigned after an internal investigation found he had breached the church’s code of conduct twice over the past decade by behaving inappropriately towards two women. The church has further been rocked by the revelation that the former Hillsong Dallas pastor Reed Bogard resigned last year after he was accused of rape. A former Hillsong college student also went public with claims that the church had covered up her sexual assault. On Thursday Hillsong Atlanta’s lead pastor, Sam Collier, resigned, citing the ongoing scandals and accusations about various members of Hillsong. “A lot of our members were becoming really fatigued with a lot of the scandals and having to talk about it so much,” Collier said. “[Trust] is the only thing you have when building a church.” That the church has chosen to act now against Houston, despite having known about the matters for some time, feels significant, and possibly indicative of an internal power struggle. Over the past two years a number of prominent Hillsong pastors have been sacked or moved to new roles for their own indiscretions, most notably the celebrity preacher Carl Lentz – but Houston remained the church’s undisputed leader. In a transcript of a leaked private video conference last week, church leaders acknowledged the obvious: Hillsong is in crisis. I would go further: it is facing catastrophe. Scandals it largely tried to blame on individual shortcomings show a widespread culture that is rotten to its core. Hillsong built an empire through an audience that is young, multicultural and majority female. They attend Hillsong because they like a particular pastor, attend a youth group, love the music, or to be among friends. That Collier, a popular and gifted young preacher, can no longer be associated with Hillsong marks a significant turn. Hip-hop-focused Hillsong Atlanta, not even 12 months old, was supposed to be a new dawn. Collier was its first African American senior pastor. He was also among the first to undergo a more stringent vetting procedure after Lentz’s downfall. Many leaders and churchgoers were awaiting the outcome of Houston’s criminal trial in Sydney for allegedly concealing child abuse by his father before making judgments for themselves. Collier’s decision may well spark an exodus. Now, other more established local pastors hold the key to Hillsong’s fate. If leaders – or significant numbers of worshipers – in places including South Africa and other branches in the US take their leave, Hillsong may find itself in freefall. That is certainly a live possibility. Having spoken to a number of Hillsongers, there is a feeling of profound sadness for what has occurred. Many are taking time for deep personal reflection. On top of the moral questions, there is also, to borrow an Australian expression, the vibe of the thing. Thanks to its modern music and upbeat style of worship, Hillsong’s popularity is due in large part to the way it helps people feel good about their faith. The vast majority of Hillsong attenders don’t have a personal connection to Brian Houston but to their local pastor. They had been able to overlook Lentz and other scandals. But the weight of them and media attention, including an explosive documentary released last week about the church, is taking its toll. Having to answer questions from friends and family about why they are still attending Hillsong will quickly dampen the feelgood appeal. Then there’s the damage to the wider brand. Hillsong’s finances are fairly opaque, but we know from other similar churches that the vast majority of their income – upwards of 80% – come from music and merchandise sales. Some 50 million people sing Hillsong songs each week in churches around the world, and its channels have had more than a billion views on YouTube. If they begin tuning out – or tuning into Hillsong’s many imitators – the entire brand could be in real trouble. For context, Hillsong church has 1.8 million Facebook followers. Its two musical arms, Hillsong United and Hillsong Worship, have a combined 12.8 million. Hillsong’s branding and financial muscle is entirely wedded to its musical empire, without which it wouldn’t have been able to spread aggressively and successfully across 30 countries on six continents. I’ve previously written that Hillsong faced a decision about whether to become more bureaucratic and rein in its pastors and lose some of its appeal, or continue on defiantly. Now, it has little choice but to launch an independent inquiry across all of its branches. The church may even need to assess whether the music and education arms need to rebrand or devolve from central leadership. Ultimately, I believe that the Houstons will be loath to give up control of the organisation that they have led for almost 40 years. Brian and his wife, Bobbie, built Hillsong from a congregation of 45 in western Sydney, and changed the global religious landscape in the process. No matter its reach, it remains very much a family firm. Which is why I would expect that Phil Dooley – the lead pastor of Hillsong Cape Town, who took on global leadership when Houston stepped aside earlier this year to contest the charges – to continue to guide the church through this rocky time. Longer-term, I suspect we may see the Houstons’ daughter, Laura, and her husband, Peter Toganivalu, become the faces of a rebirth. The youth ministry leaders, who abbreviate their surname to “Toggs” on social media, don’t carry the Houston name and are more representative of a diverse, young, global Hillsong. As for Brian Houston, expect him to stay silent until his trial is completed. Regardless of the outcome, I don’t see a man who believes so fervently in repentance and rebirth being willing to stay out of the spotlight for ever. Whether there is still the Hillsong we know today waiting for his return is another matter. For the first time in its history, Hillsong’s survival is no longer in its own hands.

3/28/2022,"Public transport use continues to lag across Sydney and trips to city offices and entertainment venues remain low, with average daily weekday trips still down 55% on pre-pandemic levels. Trips rose just 1% between February and March, despite the indoor mask mandate – which had been attributed as a leading cause of the sluggish return to offices – dropping more than a month ago. Google movement data also shows that visits to entertainment and retail venues were still more than 15% down on pre-pandemic levels, and still lagging by almost 20% at workplaces. A spokesperson from the Transport for NSW said the recent wild weather and floods had disrupted the return. Whether the city will ever get back to the pre-pandemic hustle and bustle remains a live question, with more workplaces offering hybrid working models. Chief economist at the University of Technology Sydney, Prof Tim Harcourt, said the way we operate had changed fundamentally over the past two years and that going into the city every day might not be needed for everyone now. “It was a reset of whatever we were doing before,” Harcourt said. “Covid, not that I would want to have it again, gave us a bit of a window into how we could make a change [in how we work] – it accelerated the transition.” Average daily weekday trips across Sydney’s public transport amid the Omicron wave numbered 725,000 for January – down 63% on 2019 figures. The numbers rose and then plateaued over February and March, reaching about 1m a day, which is 56% lower than pre-Covid levels. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Despite the slow start to the year, the mayor of Sydney, Clover Moore, was confident the city would rebound due to “strong, pent-up demand” and the draw to see others face-to-face. “We are working to draw people back to the city and creating spaces for businesses to operate safely,” Moore said. “Almost as soon as Covid lockdowns were introduced, the doomsayers were predicting the death of the city, but I’m hopeful this has been overstated. “What Covid has done is accelerate trends that were already occurring, including technological change and the changing nature of work. But economic clusters like technology, finance, media and entertainment … thrive on proximity to one another and remain focused here in our city.” But Harcourt said it would take major initiatives like on-site childcare at big companies to draw people back in, and that it needed to be more than “froth and bubble” gimmicks. “If they start doing major things, that might have some impact,” he said. “I don’t think office table tennis is going to cut it.” A recent Accenture study of thousands of employees from around the world found 83% wanted a hybrid working model.

3/28/2022,"Brisbane’s famous Gabba stadium has been hosting cricket matches for 127 years. And for all but four of them, East Brisbane state school (EBSS) has been sitting alongside it. The heritage-listed school has had to become accustomed over the years to the lengthening shadows cast by the stadium’s growing stands and light towers. But there are fears the 2032 Olympics may finally wrench the school from its long-held location. “We had kids crying at the school when the Olympics was announced,” says Daniel Angus, who has two children at EBSS, and whose wife, Kath, is a former Greens lord mayoral candidate. “We cannot get excited about the Olympics when we feel that a bunch of other people are coming in ripping up our community for the sake of a two-week party.” This week, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, joined Queensland’s premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, and Brisbane’s lord mayor, Adrian Schrinner, on the hallowed Gabba turf to announce a new $1.8bn funding deal for south-east Queensland. The headline project was a $450m investment in a new metro station at Woolloongabba that will connect with the city’s Cross River Rail. Still to be negotiated is a funding deal for the state government’s $1bn proposal to demolish and rebuild the Gabba from the ground up. The Gabba will receive a “major upgrade” to accommodate a minimum 50,000 spectators, and athletics track, according to the 2032 taskforce’s final submission to the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Before the Olympics were announced, EBSS was busy preparing for growth, requesting an increased footprint to cope with a growing number of enrolments each year. Now the community is fighting for the retention of the school, which currently has 283 students enrolled. Nicola Middleton, who sits on the school’s P&C, says the government has been opaque in communicating its plans for EBSS, causing the local community a great deal of anxiety. “The development of the Gabba is going to provide an environment that will make it very difficult for the school to continue in that location,” Middleton says. “What will happen to the school? Is it going to be moved temporarily or permanently? Are we going to remain and endure through the demolition and construction? “None of those questions that we’ve raised to the government have been answered.” A spokesperson for Palaszczuk told Guardian Australia the redevelopment of the Gabba is “expected to impact East Brisbane state school”. The spokesperson says the Games “are still 10 years away” and the organising committee will “consult with locals regarding planning and operational activities and ensure impacts are minimised”. But the local South Brisbane MP, the Greens’ Amy MacMahon, said the government had given “no indication … that it’s serious about protecting the school”. “The government needs to be upfront about their plans for the school, and work with the school to help enhance and expand the campus, as well as secure nearby land for the period of demolition and reconstruction of the Gabba,” MacMahon said. “Using an existing stadium, like the QSAC at Mt Gravatt, or the Metricon stadium at the Gold Coast, might be a better outcome.” The reconstruction of the Gabba is not the only government proposal to be the subject of local concern ahead of the 2032 Games. Less than a kilometre down the road, in Kangaroo Point, the government has proposed converting Raymond Park into a warm-up track for athletes. Although the government insists there will no resumption of land, and the impact on any existing facilities will be temporary, locals aren’t convinced. “The track literally won’t fit without getting rid of the dog park, the 100-year-old fig and palm trees, the barbecue areas and playgrounds, the soccer club and the community gardens,” nearby resident Melissa Occhipinti says. “And there is no way a full-sized athletics track required by the IOC can sit into the space without the resumption of houses.” A spokesperson for the premier said in consultation with council, Raymond Park has been identified as the preferred location for temporary warm-up facilities “based on its scale and proximity to the Gabba”. “The proposed temporary warm-up facilities at Raymond Park would be removed immediately following the Games and the park will be restored back to the community,” the spokesperson said. But Occhipinti says the Kangaroo Point community believes the government is robbing them of a vital green space that’s crucial for residents’ mental health and wellbeing. “An Olympic-grade athletics track is not something that you put up and down within a three-month period. It’s a big construction. “I think the loser of the Olympics is going to be the environment, quite frankly.”",News/Australia news,"As Brisbane looks ahead to the Olympics, the survival of a heritage-listed school hangs in the balance",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/28/as-brisbane-looks-ahead-to-the-olympics-the-survival-of-a-heritage-listed-school-hangs-in-the-balance
3/28/2022,"If living an ordinary life were possible, Kathleen and John Every’s five decades together were perfectly so – until the pandemic hit. Of all the thousands of moments that made up her parents’s lives, it’s their final laboured breaths that their daughter Alexa Every struggles to forget. Both of Every’s parents died in institutions during the pandemic – Kathleen on Mother’s Day 2020 after a short and distressing stint in an aged care facility, and John in hospital a year later, on Christmas Eve. Her family wasn’t alone in this unnatural grieving process. Thousands went through what Every calls “Covid-adjacent deaths” – the experience of losing a loved one not from Covid, but wrapped up in the pandemic and its associated pains. “They didn’t die directly from Covid, but I believe they both died because of Covid,” Every says. “Kathleen was only five months into living in a nursing home and was still adjusting,” she says. “Once they went into lockdown and we couldn’t visit her, she went into a terrible spiral of terror and confusion and died five weeks later. “I’m sure a huge part of her very fast decline was fear and confusion because she couldn’t see her family.” Kathleen was living with early-stage dementia when she entered aged care at the end of 2019, three months before the pandemic. Her 88-year-old husband would visit and eat lunch with her most days. Then the facility locked down, and her lifeline – her family – was suddenly cut off from her. “She couldn’t work out what was going on, it was all closed, as it was for thousands of people,” Every says. “She got really agitated and angry … she was always saying ‘When are you coming?’ to my dad. She always depended on him, to be without him would have been absolutely terrifying … then she just declined before our eyes.” Within a fortnight, the change was drastic. Eventually, Kathleen was admitted to hospital and died 10 days later. “She couldn’t live without Dad, she didn’t know how, and died in real fear,” Every says. “I think it broke her heart.” Kathleen’s funeral was particularly hard. Gatherings were capped at 10 and the immediate family had to remain socially distanced, 1.5 metres apart. Every now and then, Every and her father would reach across the seat between them and gently touch each other’s fingers in comfort. “I just wanted to hug him,” Every says. Every often wonders how her parents’ deaths would have been different if the health system wasn’t affected by Covid and loved ones weren’t isolated from each other. “I know in my own life a number of people who have had death in their family that feel they’ll never know,” Every says. “Their deaths were distressing in a way you think they didn’t need to be.” John spent the whole pandemic both relieved that Kathleen didn’t have to endure it without him and guilty he hadn’t been there beside her. The couple were inseparable since they met at a church youth camp in the 1960s – Kathleen 22, and John 10 years her senior. “It was a strange sort of grief,” Every says of her mother’s death. “We were so relieved she was no longer that distressed … we watched all the stories of people who couldn’t see their families and kept thinking ‘thank God that’s not us’.” That’s what made John’s death, 18 months later, come as such as shock. In the months after Kathleen passed, John had a few small bouts of time in hospital for physical ailments. In early December, he was booked into a busy Melbourne ward for what was expected to be a routine few days. Three weeks later, on 23 December, the hospital administered final routine blood tests and asked to keep him for 24 hours to track the results. John pushed the doctor to be sent home. But he would never make it there. “He was really a sharp and competent advocate for himself: he said three weeks is enough – it’s starting to get me down,” Every says. “I rang the doctor and said same the thing but … they were so busy. It was terrible to see how overworked the nurses were, they were so tired.” At 3am on Christmas Eve, Every received a call to say her dad had fallen out of bed. She still has no idea what happened (John was perfectly sound of mind) but the injuries he suffered were “catastrophic” – he was conscious but in severe pain. Every immediately jumped in the car, but Covid protocols were strict and it was late at night. She spent crucial time running around the hospital trying to find an entry point. “I wanted to see him before he died, and I knew he would die soon,” she says. “We’d been texting each other a few hours before [the accident]. He still had life to live … and this was an extremely unpleasant way to die … they both died in pain in different ways.” When she finally arrived, John had just lost consciousness. She had missed him “by a whisker”. “It’s nobody’s fault, the system was under so much pressure,” Every says. “So many people have had that experience. But I would’ve liked him to have seen me. It just wasn’t the way to have finished.” The one positive – if you could call it that – was a big funeral on New Year’s Eve that made up for the small gathering of mourners a year prior. Restrictions on numbers had lifted, and the seven grandchildren read John’s poetry aloud and played his favourite music. Everyone made sure to speak about Kathleen. “It was so healing,” Every says. “It helped me get back to what really mattered – not the last two hours of his life, but his whole life.” John was a stoic and good-tempered man. He spent much of his life volunteering, including for four years in Europe as a carpenter after the second world war. After marrying Kathleen in 1965, the pair went on to have twins a year later before their third daughter, Alexa, arrived. “No life is typical when you scratch the surface, but they lived a typical life of their era,” Every says. Kathleen was a prep teacher and a stay-at-home mother, while John worked as a quantity surveyor. They spent their whole married lives “intertwined and very much in love”, living in a house John designed in Melbourne’s leafy suburb of Templestowe, with a back yard that backed on to the Yarra River. Every and her siblings are only now undergoing the painful process of packing up the house of their childhood. Her parents’ lives were of a different era. John and Kathleen took pleasure in the little things – camping together, playing classical music and writing each other Valentine’s Day cards. “There was a simplicity out of what they wanted from life,” Every says. “I find myself feeling nostalgic for that childhood. It’s a very unusual feeling – to not have any parents for the first time. “Working out who we are, and how we relate to each other is different now.” Every remembers her parents – before the pandemic, lockdowns and hospital beds – the richness of their humble lives, and the beauty they found within them. “We’ve had to reflect on their lives since they’ve died, and I’ve thought a lot about how an ordinary life is not ordinary,” she says. “Ordinary people do really interesting things and are clever, and funny, and kind. It’s all the complexities – a relationship of over 50 years, parenting, grandparenting. Of my mum being disappointed in life sometimes, and of my dad being so caring and patient and supportive. “Of them always being there for each other … that’s not ordinary.”",News/Australia news,"‘They didn’t die from Covid, but because of Covid’: the inseparable couple torn apart by the pandemic ",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/28/they-didnt-die-from-covid-but-because-of-covid-the-inseparable-couple-torn-apart-by-the-pandemic
3/28/2022,"A new report commissioned by the Victorian government has found gender inequality is entrenched in the gig economy, with women earning up to 37% less than men. The report, produced by a Queensland University of Technology research team and released on Monday, summarises Australian and global studies and found the gig economy can “both reproduce and exacerbate existing gender inequalities in work”. According to the report, women in gig economy roles in Australia earn between 10% and 37% less than men. For the same work, men earned on average $2.67 per hour more than women, though about 40% of gig economy workers do not know what their hourly rate is. Women were also significantly more likely to earn less than $40,000 annually off-platform. They are more likely to be homemakers or unpaid carers – or, if employed, to be in work that is part-time, casual, or on a fixed-term contract. Men in the gig economy are more likely to work in software development and technology, transport and food delivery and skilled trade, while women are more likely to participate in historically feminised work such as clerical and data entry, sales and marketing support, writing and translation and care work. According to the report, 14% of women nominated the location of their platform work as being “in the home of an individual client”, compared to 5% of men. Melbourne woman Lorna Berry said she took up ride-share driving in 2016 to supplement her income. But Berry is the first to admit there are challenges unique to female drivers.

You get asked asked a lot, ‘Do you feel safe? Where’s your partner, what’s he’s doing?’ It’s none of your business,” she said. “I’ve had people criticise my driving – but then on the other hand some are really surprised I’m a good driver, it’s kind of a backhanded compliment.” Women are also more at risk of psychical and sexual assault and exposure to illegal activity. Berry recalled a man who insisted she drive the back streets of Eltham, north-east of Melbourne, late at night. She drove with a can of deodorant between her legs ready to use. Another man claimed to be a police officer and repeatedly asked her if she had heard about a taxi driver that had recently been stabbed by a passenger and if she was scared. “That was pretty unnerving. I reported him to Uber and I just got a generic response back that he had been spoken to and that I won’t be matched with him again. I still don’t know what amounted of it,” Berry said. The Victorian government established an inquiry into the on-demand workforce in 2018 and has accepted all 20 recommendations either fully or in principle, including developing standards on fair conditions and pay. “The gig economy can be a winner for workers, but for too many people – including many women – platform work can fail them on the test of fairness. We’re working to improve conditions in Victoria,” industrial relations minister Tim Pallas said.",News/Australia news,Report into the gig economy finds women are earning 37% less than men ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/28/report-into-the-gig-economy-finds-women-are-earning-37-less-than-men
3/28/2022,"A Ukrainian MP has raised alarm about Russian soldiers raping and sexually assaulting women during its invasion, and said Ukraine would “not be silent” about the crimes. In a TV interview, Maria Mezentseva referenced one case in Brovary, an eastern suburb of Kyiv, where a woman was raped in front of her child. On Wednesday, the prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said the attack was being investigated by the authorities and Ukraine had told Russia that an arrest warrant had been issued for the serviceman. Speaking on Sky News’ Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Mezentseva said: “There is one case which was very widely discussed recently because it’s been recorded and proceeded with [by] the prosecutor’s office, and we’re not going into details, but it’s quite a scary scene when a civilian was shot dead in his house in a small town next to Kyiv. “His wife was – I’m sorry but I have to say it – raped several times in front of her underage child.” After the attack, the soldier is believed to have threatened the child. Mezentseva, the head of Ukraine’s permanent delegation to the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe, said that cases needed to be recorded, as “justice has to prevail”. Rape and sexual assault are considered war crimes and a breach of international humanitarian law. She said cases were being underreported, and added that she hoped that the UK could pass on expertise on how to support victims in the aftermath of crimes. “There are many more victims rather than just this one case which has been made public by the prosecutor general,” she said. “And of course, we are expecting many more of them, which will be public once victims will be ready to talk about that. “That’s why you know, when we’ve been talking to Boris Johnson, when we will be talking to your Home Office, when we’ve been talking to MPs of UK, we’ve also raised this issue that this aftermath, which we are dealing with right now, the aftermath of war, has to be taken very cautiously, very seriously, and to take into account the UK experience and experience of other countries, which can help us in dealing with psychologists, and how to help these people to actually live over these cases, to keep going afterwards, to keep living.” She added: “We will definitely not be silent.” Her words echoed those of fellow Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko, who addressed UK MPs earlier in March and said Russian soldiers were sexually assaulting and raping women. She said: “We have reports of women being gang-raped. These women are usually the ones who are unable to get out. We are talking about senior citizens. Most of these women have either been executed after the crime of rape or they have taken their own lives.”",News/World news,"Russian soldiers raping and sexually assaulting women, says Ukraine MP",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/27/russian-soldiers-raping-and-sexually-assaulting-women-says-ukraine-mp
3/28/2022,"My friend and colleague Alun Rees, who has died suddenly aged 83, enjoyed a long and distinguished career in teaching English as a foreign language. Alun worked for more than 40 years in schools, universities and ministries of education in 16 countries. He specialised in teacher education, and was well known for his inspirational training sessions combining deep scholarship with humour and imagination. Born in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, to Joan (nee Watts), a piano teacher, and Thomas Rees, a works manager, Alun went to Haverfordwest grammar school. In the early 1960s, after graduating from University College Cardiff with a degree in English and philosophy, Alun set off to Spain to teach at the Berlitz school in Burgos for three years. In those days few commercial teaching materials existed and Alun began developing his own wide range of innovative teaching ideas. After four years teaching at Trujillo University in Peru and three at the National University of Laos, in 1977 Alun moved to Senegal, where he worked for six years as English language teaching adviser to the ministry of education, setting up in-service teacher education programmes. During this time he won the English-Speaking Union prize for an article on teacher observation. In 1983 he returned to the UK to begin a doctorate at the Institute of Education in London. Throughout the 80s Alun was in great demand to teach on residential teacher training programmes, particularly in Spain, invited by the British Council and the Spanish ministry of education. The teachers loved him for the original way he delivered serious content, and for the evening shows he organised and compered, full of original sketches, songs, puppets, magic tricks and prizes. After completing his doctorate, Alun taught at the West Sussex Institute of Higher Education (now the University of Chichester) and then Exeter University, where he met Ekuko Narushima; they married in 2000. Colleagues speak of Alun’s popularity and how much students appreciated his courses. He ended his career at the University of Gloucestershire as a highly successful head of the international office. Alun enjoyed 20 years of retirement in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, with Ekuko, involved in fishing, organic gardening and applying his mind to the non-chemical deterrence of pests, from squirrels to slugs. He maintained a regular correspondence with many former colleagues and students, sending insightful emails on language teaching, fishing, horticulture and the state of the world. Alun is survived by Ekuko.",News/Education,Alun Rees obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/27/alun-rees-obituary
