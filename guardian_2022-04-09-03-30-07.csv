4/9/2022,"The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has said his country is doing all it can to wean itself off Russian energy, but declined to endorse a claim by Boris Johnson that it would stop importing Russian gas by the middle of 2024. Scholz said only that the goal would be achieved very soon, and that Germany would stop using Russian coal by the summer and Russian oil by the end of the year. The two leaders were speaking at a Downing Street press conference after the first extensive bilateral talks since Scholz was elected to head a coalition government. Scholz also implied Germany would not supply Ukraine with 100 Marder tanks, saying he would only supply weapons that were practical and useful. A Ukrainian request for the tanks has been held up by the German defence department, leading to tensions between the Ukrainians and Germans. Johnson, one of the closest allies of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, struck a different tone than Scholz about the value of holding talks with Vladimir Putin, after Polish criticism of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for persisting with his dialogue with the Russian leader. Johnson said: “I have got to say, negotiating with Putin does not seem to be full of promise or that he can be trusted.” He said he was “deeply, deeply sceptical and cynical about Putin’s assurances” and that “the Europe we knew just six weeks ago no longer exists”. Scholz said the criticism of Macron was unjustified and that it was important Putin heard voices other than from his inner circle. Throughout the press conference, Scholz was challenged to explain why Germany was not willing to go faster to reduce the scale of Russian energy imports, given the €35bn (£29bn) in revenue from the EU it has generated for Russia since the war started. He insisted it would take time to remove the legal obstacle to build the necessary liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals on Germany’s northern coast that would be able to store imported LNG from countries such as Qatar and the US. He said: “We are actively working to get independent from the import of oil and we think that we will be able to make it during this year. And we are actively working to get independent from the necessity of importing gas from Russia. This is, as you may imagine, not that easy, because it needs infrastructure to be built.” Johnson voiced sympathy over the German predicament. “This is not easy for any of us and I applaud the seismic decisions taken by Olaf’s government to move Germany away from Russian hydrocarbons. We cannot transform our respective energy systems overnight, but we also know that Putin’s war will not end overnight”. However, he then added: “I think by the middle of 2024, as I recall, Germany’s going to stop using Russian gas, which is quite extraordinary.” Asked if he agreed with Johnson’s timetable, Scholz simply said: “We are optimistic that we will get rid of the need of importing gas from Russia very soon.” Scholz stressed that the change in Germany’s energy supplies would be permanent, something he said would cause long-term damage to the Russian economy. He said Germany would be using renewables for all its electricity within 20 years. On arming Ukraine, Johnson signalled a change in strategy. “Some of the kit that Nato has simply wouldn’t be appropriate. It may be more useful to support them, the Ukrainians, by backfilling and allowing some of the former Warsaw Pact countries to supply some of their own armour,” he said. The Ukrainian armed forces are trained to use the kind of heavy weaponry that the Czechs and Slovaks are supplying. Britain is sending Ukraine more Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles and 800 anti-tank missiles after an “unconscionable” attack on a train station in the eastern Ukraine city of Kramatorsk on Friday, Johnson said. The “high-grade military equipment” is worth £100m, Johnson said, with the UK anti-tank missiles seen as particularly potent against Russian forces. Asked if Germany was willing to send Marder tanks, Scholz said: “We are trying to send those weapons that are helpful and can be used. The successes by the Ukrainian military show that we sent effective weapons – anti-tank weapons, a lot of ammunition and everything that goes with it. At the same time … we have to take a close look at what can be used effectively, and these are very technical questions.”",News/World news,"Germany will stop importing Russian gas ‘very soon’, says Olaf Scholz",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/08/germany-russian-gas-imports-olaf-scholz-boris-johnson-ukraine
4/9/2022,"Germany’s first democratically elected chancellor used the country’s foreign intelligence service to systematically spy on his biggest political rivals for almost a decade, a group of independent historians tasked with researching the formerly West German spy agency’s history have discovered. The covert and illegal flow of information between the offices of Konrad Adenauer and the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) chief, Reinhard Gehlen, enabled the conservative politician to cement his hold on power through accurate insider knowledge on the campaign strategies, parliamentary manoeuvres and internal power struggles of the Social Democratic party (SPD), which led the opposition in the Bundestag at the time. Klaus-Dietmar Henke, a spokesperson for the research group looking into the spy agency’s history, likened the scheme to the Watergate scandal in the US, when Richard Nixon planned to have ex-CIA and FBI agents bug the headquarters of the Democratic party. Unlike Nixon’s bungled break-in, however, Adenauer’s infiltration of his rival party was a success – and until now had eluded historians. The heavily annotated correspondence between the German chancellor and the spy agency has for decades been stored at the archives of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in Sankt Augustin, but its significance has only become apparent now after Henke was able to view it in parallel with declassified files from the BND. Details from the reports have been exclusively published by Süddeutsche Zeitung and shared with the Guardian and the Washington Post. Adenauer, a devoutly Catholic Rhinelander who was twice arrested as a political enemy by the Nazis, is still fondly remembered in modern Germany as the chancellor who docked his country to the western sphere of influence and oversaw an economic revival after the second world war. The headquarters and in-house thinktank of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the party he co-founded, are still named after him. “Konrad Adenauer was a key figure of the 20th century and a great German chancellor,” said Henke. “But his chummy arrangement with the BND against the SPD confirms in the most drastic way possible that he was also a brutally callous power-seeker.” Narrowly elected as chancellor in 1949, Adenauer was in the early 1950s seeking ways to consolidate his role at the top of a freshly forged West German republic that was finding itself on the frontline of a new conflict between east and west. The former mayor of Cologne did not only fear enemies on the other side of the iron curtain but also in the ranks of the centre-left Social Democrats. A 1953 CDU election poster warned that “all the paths of Marxism lead to Moscow”, even though the SPD at the time had positioned itself as a nationalist and patriotic outfit. In December 1953 an opportunity presented itself for Adenauer to monitor and thus keep at bay his largest political rivals. Reinhard Gehlen, the head of an intelligence agency set up as a German branch of the CIA, had secured as an informant the SPD’s executive secretary at the time, Siegfried Ortloff. Between 1953 and 1962, Ortloff verbally passed on almost 500 confidential memos that were typed up at Gehlen’s intelligence agency and then handed over to Adenauer’s chief of staff, from where they found their way to the desk of the chancellor. The memos gave Adenauer a major tactical advantage, outlining ahead of public announcements which politicians the SPD was planning to put forward as chancellor candidates in federal elections or for the mainly ceremonial role of the presidency. They allowed Adenauer to prepare in advance for motions the opposition planned to submit or for lines of attack that were being readied against his team, such as one raising the role his chief of staff, Hans Globke, had played in drafting the Nazis’ Nuremberg race laws. They gave the chancellor live updates on the centre-left’s latest internal debates and the vulnerabilities that came with them, whether over German rearmament or over its formal renouncement of orthodox Marxism in 1959. In several instances, Adenauer’s office requested specific information on political rivals from German spies. A year before the 1961 national elections, the intelligence agency was tasked with digging up information on his challenger, Willy Brandt, such as the identity of his first wife and whether he had played a part in the “liquidation” of a tearaway faction of Trotskyists during the Spanish civil war,which Brandt had covered as a journalist while in exile from the Nazis. The covert arrangement with the intelligence agency proved a career booster not only for Adenauer, who stayed in power for 14 years before stepping down at the age of 87, but also for Gehlen, whose budding relationship with the German head of government put him in a prime position to lead the newly formed foreign intelligence agency, the BND, in 1956. “Gehlen, like Adenauer, did not view social democracy as a political competitor but as an enemy,” said Henke, whose book on the BND’s illegal activities will be published in Germany in May. “What the two of them practised for almost 10 years was a crusade against an opponent they believed justified every means possible.” The motivation of the mole inside the Social Democrats’ headquarters is less clear. An investigation by Süddeutsche Zeitung suggests Ortloff could have been driven by a personal rivalry with and political distrust of the former communist Herbert Wehner, a dominant figure in the SPD at the time. Surviving family members said they could not believe Ortloff would have knowingly betrayed the political movement he had started supporting in his youth. But that Ortloff was passing on confidential information in full knowledge of its use is without doubt: in 1962, the year Gehlen decided to wind down his secret collaboration, his reliable source sent him a birthday letter that expressed gratitude “for my involvement as a trusted collaborator”. Ortloff’s handler in the BND, a man named Siegfried Ziegler, tried to blow the whistle five years after the surveillance scheme had come to an end. Between 1967 and 1969 he sent a series of letters to the SPD leadership offering to reveal everything on what he described as “reactionary powers” trying to circumvent the laws of the land. The SPD’s then parliamentary chair and later the chancellor, Helmut Schmidt, replied with a polite but short letter – and left the veil that had been drawn over the saga firmly in place.",News/World news,Germany’s Watergate: 1950s chancellor used spy agency to infiltrate rival party,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/08/germany-1950s-chancellor-konrad-adenauer-spy-agency-infiltrate-rival-party-watergate
4/9/2022,"Why has Britain, unlike every other country in Europe, insisted on requiring all Ukrainian refugees to obtain visas before travelling here? In justifying the decision, Priti Patel has again pointed to the Windrush scandal as a key factor in the government’s refusal to waive visas for people fleeing Ukraine. But it is a reasoning that has left immigration experts baffled. Refugee charities have repeatedly called on the UK to scrap visa requirements for Ukrainians, and there is rising public anger about the delays in the visa issuing process. Explaining why Britain is putting refugees through a visa application process, Patel told the BBC: “I’m pretty certain you may have reported on a previous scandal which was Windrush – because they had no documentation effectively people tried to remove them. The visas are important because they are documented – it gives people the right to work, to establish themselves, to get their children into school.” Last month Patel gave the same justification in a debate in parliament, insisting that visas were necessary because of “something known as the Windrush scandal”. Her comments triggered cries of anger in the Commons, prompting her to add: “They may holler on the other side but the process is absolutely vital in terms of the verification, notification and permission to travel, but importantly to give people the status when they come to the United Kingdom to have that right to work, the right to access some benefits and also the digital verification of their status.” But the comparison is somewhat confusing. In the Windrush scandal, the government mistakenly categorised thousands of people who were living entirely legally in the UK as illegal immigrants, and some were arrested, detained and deported to countries they had left as children decades earlier. Those affected had arrived legally in the UK in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s when there was a principle of free movement between the UK and countries previously colonised by Britain. When immigration restrictions tightened in the early 1970s, not everyone was given new documentation, and when checks on documentation were intensified under a series of so-called hostile environment policies from 2012 onwards, many of those affected found themselves unable to prove that they had the right to live in the UK. Paperwork that might have helped them to prove their right to be here had been destroyed by the Home Office in 2010. Most Ukrainian refugees fleeing the country are travelling with modern biometric passports, and if they do not have a passport most will be carrying an ID card. For the few people who have fled their homes with no documentation at all, different checks could be put in place. Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said the UK’s asylum system was designed to make sure that people who arrive here without paperwork are given documentation on arrival. “This whole notion that visas are the only mechanism to facilitate paperwork to ensure someone is able to remain here and doesn’t end up like the Windrush individuals just doesn’t hold water at all,” he said. “I think the government is on the back foot. Priti Patel recognises that she’s having to apologise, and she’s having to cast around for justification – but this justification seems to smack of a degree of desperation.” Colin Yeo, an immigration lawyer and the author of Welcome to Britain: Fixing Our Broken Immigration System, was also puzzled. “I can’t see any reason to compare this to Windrush, it just doesn’t compute,” he said. “It seems like a total misunderstanding of the way the visa and immigration system works. If you lifted the visa requirement for Ukrainians, they would be in the same position as EU nationals or as American tourists coming to Britain. They would still pass through passport control or get examined by an immigration officer, and then could be granted leave to remain just as a US tourist would.”",News/UK news,Using Windrush to justify UK visa rule for Ukrainian refugees baffles experts,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/08/using-windrush-to-justify-uk-visa-rule-for-ukrainian-refugees-baffles-experts
4/9/2022,"A police inquiry involving a Unite union official is examining contracts related to the construction of a £98m hotel and conference centre in Birmingham, the Guardian has learned. South Wales police and HM Revenue and Customs raided the union’s offices in central London on Thursday as part of an investigation into allegations of bribery, fraud and money laundering. Sources confirmed that contracts related to the 170-room hotel and conference centre were part of their inquiries. It is understood police are also examining contracts related to members’ services that were connected to the union. More than 20 officers arrived unannounced on Wednesday at the union’s offices in Holborn, central London. Police examined a single office and took away dozens of files, documents and a computer. Police have also searched a number of other addresses in south Wales, Merseyside, Cheshire, north Wales, Greater London and Northamptonshire. A document leaked to the Guardian in January last year showed that costs for the Unite hotel and conference centre appeared to have more than doubled from 2015, when the initial estimates were £35m, to 2020. The build was completed in December 2020 at a cost of £98m. The then general secretary, Len McCluskey, told a meeting of the Unite executive council in January 2021 that costs had risen because of the union’s promise to employ workers who had union membership, avoiding the involvement of firms that had a history of blacklisting, directly employing workers and paying them at least national pay rates. The union’s executive committee concluded that the directly employed labour, high construction costs in Birmingham and a change in project scope pushed up the price. The election of a new Unite general secretary last summer prompted calls from MPs and union officials for an inquiry into the costs. The newly elected general secretary, Sharon Graham, launched an inquiry in December into how the building costs spiralled into a “potentially significant loss” for the union. On Thursday a Unite spokesperson said: “A Unite employee is subject to a criminal investigation by the police. On Wednesday 6 April the employee’s office at Unite HQ, in Holborn, London, was accessed and searched by the police under warrant.” A police spokesperson said: “South Wales police has executed warrants as part of an investigation into allegations of bribery, fraud and money laundering. “The warrants were executed on Wednesday 6 April at addresses in the South Wales, Metropolitan, Merseyside, Cheshire, north Wales, Dyfed Powys and Northamptonshire police force areas. “The joint investigation with Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs is continuing and a number of suspects will be interviewed in due course.” On Friday neither the police nor the union added to their previous statements.",News/UK news,Police examining contracts related to Unite’s £98m Birmingham hotel project,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/08/police-examining-contracts-related-to-unite-birmingham-hotel-project
4/9/2022,"Thousands of civilians, including many children, were waiting to be evacuated to safety in the Kramatorsk railway station in eastern Ukraine on Friday morning when two missiles, later reported to be cluster weapons that are banned under international law, exploded in their midst. At least 50 people died, and more than 100 others were injured. A message in Russian on the surviving casing of one missile read “For the children”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, understandably described the attack as the action of “an evil that has no limits”. Even amid so many other horrors in Russia’s war on Ukraine, the Kramatorsk attack stands out for heartless brutality. It is a week now since Russian forces began to retreat after their invasion stalled around Kyiv. During that time, reporters have filed horrific revelations of the carnage and destruction that the defeated Russians left behind them. Evidence from places such as Bucha, Irpin, Hostomel and Borodianka, in all of which Ukrainian civilians appear to have been summarily murdered, has appalled the civilised world. War crime charges rightly seem certain to be brought against Russia. Now the crimes of Kramatorsk must be added to the charge sheet. The past 10 days mark an important change in the dynamics and location of the Ukraine war. But it is not a simple or conclusive change yet. Ukrainian resistance, aided by western weaponry and technology, has secured a notable military victory by forcing the Russians to retreat. Kyiv is, for now, able to come back to a kind of life; a few refugees have begun returning from the west, and western leaders, including the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, have travelled there to show solidarity. Russian troops have now left the Sumy region in the north-east. Ukraine has also regained control of its border with Belarus. But the war itself is far from over. Moscow’s forces are regrouping in the east, following Russia’s decision to make the Donbas region its primary focus. This is somewhat easier territory for them logistically and politically. It heralds a further assault in Mariupol, fresh offensives in Donbas (of which the missile attack on Kramatorsk station is part) and against Odesa, all of which will stretch Ukrainian supply lines and resources. As a result, President Zelenskiy has increased his calls for further western military aid. After a week like the last one, he has morality more than ever on his side. He is also likely to feel less pressure to seek a compromise peace deal. Yet by making these appeals, the Ukrainian president has helped to trigger a new and intense phase of debate in the western democracies about how far they are really willing to go in supporting Ukraine militarily. This has exposed genuine differences about real dilemmas. The Czech Republic has supplied Soviet-era tanks, Poland is considering following suit and Slovakia has sent air defence systems. The US, Britain and France are more cautious, yet all of them have been quietly and incrementally crossing the military threshold they adopted in February that only defensive support would be given. Some in the west, including the Commons defence select committee chair, Tobias Ellwood, want them to go further. This important argument is now taking place in real time. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s welcome visit to Downing Street on Friday was very much part of this process; an announcement about anti-tank weapons was expected. Britain, like all the western allies, needs to be more open about the choices that we and our allies face as a result of the new phase in Ukraine. At the very least, there is now a powerful case for parliament to be recalled before Easter, so that the very serious military options now under active consideration by governments can be more openly examined.",Opinion/Opinion,"The Guardian view on Ukraine: same war, new dilemmas | Editorial",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/08/the-guardian-view-on-ukraine-same-war-new-dilemmas
4/9/2022,"Peter Bowen extended his remarkable record in the Topham Handicap Chase over the Grand National fences here on Friday, as Mac Tottie, at 8-1, crossed the line in front after a dramatic race in which 11 of the 29 runners failed to finish. Three horses departed at the ninth fence, as Foxy Jacks fell and rolled to his left, bringing down Colorado Doc and Discordantly. Morning Vicar was also a faller, while three horses unseated their riders – including Notebook, with last year’s National winning jockey, Rachael Blackmore, in the saddle – and four more were pulled up. All horses and jockeys were later reported to be unhurt. Mac Tottie was Bowen’s fifth Topham winner, equalling Nicky Henderson’s record, and added to the same horse’s success over the National fences in the Grand Sefton Chase in November. James Bowen was aboard Mac Tottie for that victory, while another of the trainer’s three sons, Sean, took the reins on Friday. “I’m not being biased but Dad is brilliant,” Sean Bowen said. “When he wants to get one ready, he gets one ready. James schooled him a couple of days ago and my other brother, Mickey, always rides him [at home] and the last week or so they couldn’t wait for him to run. “James was revved to ride him and then he had to ride one [Fantastic Lady] for the boss [Nicky Henderson] and came off at the first.” James Bowen could be seen celebrating behind the running rail as his brother went clear on the run to the line. “I don’t know what it is about this place, but I love it,” Peter Bowen said. “If he gets the trip, he might be a National horse, maybe we’ll have a go next year.” Earlier on the card, Ahoy Senor reversed earlier Grade One form with both L’Homme Presse and Bravemansgame to win the Grade One Mildmay Novice Chase. Ahoy Senor took up his favoured position at the head of the field from the off and one by one his three opponents wilted, allowing Derek Fox to cross the line an easy four lengths in front of Fury Road. “At Cheltenham [behind L’Homme Presse] he actually learned what he was supposed to be doing,” Lucinda Russell, the winner’s trainer, said, “and he just showed it today. “When he goes left-handed he jumps slightly right, and when he went right-handed he jumped slightly left, so it’s just his way of sorting things out for himself.

4/9/2022,"All was quiet on Friday outside the £1.5m North Yorkshire manor house the Sunaks occasionally call home – apart from the builders beavering away on the swimming pool being constructed in the paddock by the family lake. One of the workers said he had never met their clients, but he knew all about the tax arrangements of Akshata Murty, better known round these parts as Mrs Sunak. Was he bothered? He shrugged. “It’s what they do.” Who? “Rich people. They don’t pay tax and poor people do.” A few miles up the road in Northallerton, the biggest town in Sunak’s Richmond constituency, there was genuine anger from some staunch Conservative voters at Murty’s non-dom status. “It matters,” said 79-year-old Carole Gates “If they [the Sunaks] are both resident in the UK they should be paying all their taxes here. It makes me cross and it does change my opinion of Rishi. I thought he was doing his best and that he was doing quite a good job, but he has gone down in my estimation a lot.” She wasn’t sure she could vote for him again. But where to go instead? She wrinkled her nose at the suggestion of Keir Starmer’s Labour party. Others had already fallen out of love with Sunak before the latest revelations. Hotel housekeeper Jade Green, 27, accused Sunak of having no idea what life was like for ordinary people. Sunak’s decision to lend struggling households £200 to help with their soaring energy bills had gone down particularly badly. “I’ve worked my arse off to get out of debt and I feel like this will get me back into it again,” she said. “The cost of everything is going up. It costs me £30 a week to drive to work now – that’s three hours wages for me. [Sunak] hasn’t got a clue.” Though she is in work, Green relies on universal credit to pay most of her rent, and the government’s housing allowance is too meagre to cover most properties in affluent Northallerton, she complained. The wider constituency is one of the wealthiest in the north of England, ranked 450th out of 533 on the index of multiple deprivation. Outside Betty’s tea room, Ronnie Wood (“not that one”), said he was done with the Tories. Murty’s non-dom status is “just another skeleton being brought out of the closet”, said the 61-year-old. He was sceptical whether it would change anything – “I find it disappointing the complacency of the general public, how accepting people are. I think we should expect more of our MPs.” But he personally was not voting Conservative again, because of Boris Johnson, not Sunak: “I don’t believe a word he says.” Gary Scaife, a retired doubleglazing fitter enjoying an alfresco pint with his wife, Julie, thought Sunak’s political career was not yet dead. “I still think he is a good lad. I think he will still be the next prime minister whenever Boris Johnson goes, but I won’t be voting for him again,” he said. Why? “Taxes. Everything is going up. My van used to cost £155 a year to tax – I just renewed it and it’s £275.” Despite widespread anger in the constituency, no one seemed to think Sunak was in any danger of losing the seat he has held since 2015, when he took over from William Hague. He won a 27,210 majority in 2019, with Labour coming a very distant second. Some defended him on the basis that Murty hadn’t done anything illegal. And as one woman put it: “At the end of the day, he kept everyone fed and watered and put a roof over everyone’s head during the lockdowns, and their taxes are their business and nobody’s else’s.” Sunak remains popular among many local business owners, even in the pubs where the teetotal chancellor never orders a pint. Deba Crow-Clark, landlady of the Tickle Toby Inn, said Sunak had helped her personally: “He’s never been anything other than supportive to us, and also to my sister, who runs an ice-cream parlour over the road. She’s actually friends with him. They go to a step class together at the local leisure centre. He goes there on a Sunday with his security guards.” She didn’t know much about the tax stuff – “But who likes paying taxes? I know I don’t want to pay inheritance tax, for example, so who am I to criticise? But I don’t have a bad word to say about Rishi or his wife.”",News/Politics,‘It’s what they do’: voters at Sunak’s Yorkshire seat react to wife’s tax status,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/08/voters-rishi-sunak-richmond-yorkshire-seat-react-akshata-murty-tax-status
