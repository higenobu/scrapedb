1/15/2022,"An American fugitive who is believed to have faked his own death to evade a rape charge is facing extradition after being arrested in a Glasgow hospital. Nicholas Rossi, 34, was wanted by Interpol in connection with the alleged sexual assault in Utah, US, in 2008.  He was arrested using the alias Arthur Knight at the Queen Elizabeth university hospital in Glasgow on 13 December after he was admitted with coronavirus. Utah prosecutors said the alleged fugitive “fled the country to avoid prosecution” and “attempted to lead investigators and state legislators in other states to believe that he was deceased”. They are now seeking his extradition back to Utah. “We have full faith and support of Scotland police in this matter,” Utah county attorney David Leavitt said. “Ultimately, the decision regarding bail is left to the international courts until Mr Rossi is extradited to the United States.” Police Scotland said the fugitive was arrested in Glasgow last month in connection with an international arrest warrant. A spokesperson said: “A report was submitted to the procurator fiscal.” Rossi used many aliases while on the run, including Nicholas Alahverdian, Nicholas Alahverdian Rossi, Nicholas Edward Rossi, Nicholas Alahverdian-Rossi, Nick Alan, Nicholas Brown, Arthur Brown and Arthur Knight. It was reported by several media outlets in 2020 that Nicholas Alahverdian had died on 29 February 2020 from non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The website EverLoved.com claimed that his body was cremated, while his ashes were supposedly scattered at sea. An online obituary read: “Nicholas Alahverdian’s battle for life ended on February 29, 2020. “The children and families in the care of the Rhode Island Department of Children Youth and Families (DCYF) for whom he inspired and led through turbulent government transgressions have lost a warrior that fought on the front lines for two decades.” Rossi used the alias while living in the US state of Rhode Island and was involved in local politics, it has been reported. It is understood the FBI also had a warrant for his arrest on charges of defrauding his foster father by taking out credit cards in his name and running up debts of more than $200,000, according to BBC News. The Utah rape charge came as part of a review of historical sex assault cases where DNA evidence kits had not been tested.",News/UK news,US man who faked death to evade rape charge arrested in Glasgow hospital,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/14/us-man-who-faked-death-to-evade-charge-arrested-in-glasgow-hospital
1/15/2022,"Mike Pence has equated Democratic efforts to pass voting rights protections with the 6 January attack on the US Capitol, writing in a staggeringly misleading and inaccurate op-ed that both were “power grabs” which posed a threat to the US constitution.  As vice-president to Donald Trump, Pence refused to overturn the 2020 election, rebuffing pressure to reject valid slates of electors at the Capitol on 6 January 2021. Such an effort would have amounted to a coup d’état, the rightful winner of the presidential election – Joe Biden – denied the Oval Office. Some rioters chanted “Hang Mike Pence” as they roamed the halls of Congress. Others erected a gallows outside. Fight to Vote But in the Washington Post on Friday, Pence argued that Democratic proposals to expand voter access – such as requiring mail-in ballot drop boxes, loosening voter ID requirements and allowing for same-day registration and voter access – were just as unconstitutional as an attempt to upend constitutional procedure with violence. The other Democratic proposal Pence said was akin to the Capitol siege was a proposal to restore a key piece of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that required places with a history of voting discrimination to get changes approved by the federal government before they go into effect. “Their plan to end the filibuster to allow Democrats to pass a bill nationalizing our elections would offend the founders’ intention that states conduct elections just as much as what some of our most ardent supporters would have had me do one year ago,” Pence wrote. “The notion that Congress would break the filibuster rule to pass a law equaling a wholesale takeover of elections by the federal government is inconsistent with our nation’s history and an affront to our constitution’s structure.” The characterization was inaccurate. The US constitution explicitly gives Congress a role in setting the rules for federal elections. Article I, Section IV reads: “The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations.” Pence also falsely wrote that Democratic proposals would require states to adopt “universal mail-in voting”, a term typically used to describe the process in states like Colorado and Washington that automatically mail ballots to registered voters. Legislation proposed by Democrats would require states to allow anyone who wants to vote by mail to be able to request a ballot, but would impose no requirement that states automatically send them to all voters. The former vice-president has previously downplayed the Capitol attack by saying there was too much focus on “one day in January”. In his column for the Post, he said: “Lives were lost and many were injured.” Seven people, law enforcement officers among them, died in connection with the attack. More than 100 officers were injured. More than 700 people have been charged in connection with the attack. On Thursday, 11 members of the Oath Keepers militia were charged with seditious conspiracy. Democrats charge that elections laws passed in Republican-run states since 6 January 2021 seek to restrict voting by groups liable to vote Democratic, African Americans prominent among them. Biden has spoken forcefully on the issue, saying federal voting rights protections are needed to counter such racist moves. Republicans have protested the president’s rhetoric. Republican legislators have also sought to make it easier to overturn election results, while Trump allies seek to fill key elections posts from which they would control the counting of votes in future elections. Voting rights bills proposed by Democrats would increase protections for election officials who have faced an unprecedented wave of harassment over the last year. They would also prevent partisan actors from removing elections officials without cause and make it easier for voters to go to court to ensure valid votes are not rejected. In short, Democrats aim to put in place legal standards to guarantee that no other vice-president is put in the position Pence was on 6 January 2021. While Biden has made a strong push in support of the voting rights legislation, its prospects look dim. Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin, staunch defenders of the filibuster, the 60-vote rule required to advance most legislation in the Senate, said on Thursday they would not vote to amend the requirement. Because no Republicans support doing away with the filibuster, the Democratic voting rights bills cannot pass right now.",News/US news,Mike Pence equates voting rights protections with Capitol attack,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/14/mike-pence-equates-voting-rights-capitol-attack
1/15/2022,"Erling Haaland has hinted he could decide his next move in the coming weeks, and accused Borussia Dortmund of putting pressure on him to make a decision. In a revealing post-game interview with Jan Åge Fjortoft for Norwegian TV channel Viaplay, Haaland indicated that pressure from within the club means that “things will happen now,” rather than in the summer, with regard to his future.  “The last six months I have chosen not to say anything out of respect for Dortmund, but now the club has started to press me into making a decision,” Haaland said. “All I want to do is play football. But they press me … about my future, so that means I have to make a decision soon.” When asked if he could decide imminently where he plays next season, Haaland added: “That is what they [Dortmund] want. It means things will happen now. They have started to put a lot of pressure on me, and I have to accept that … so now is the time to get things started. The Norway international told his compatriot that ideally, he would delay his decision “because we are in the middle of a difficult period, with a lot of games. I have said from the beginning that I want to focus on football, because that is when I am at my best. But I can’t do that now.” The Borussia Dortmund CEO, Hans-Joachim Watzke, was quick to respond to his player’s remarks, downplaying suggestions of a row but failing to deny Haaland’s claims that the club want him to make a decision soon. “There’s no problem with Erling,” Watzke told Ruhr Nachrichten. “He is a spontaneous person. He’s allowed to do that. But he must also have some understanding for our situation – we can’t wait until the end of May.” The 21-year-old is believed to have a €75m release clause in his contract which comes into effect this summer. Haaland’s comments come after his agent, Mino Raiola, said in December that the forward would “take the next step” from Dortmund eventually. Raiola named Bayern Munich, Manchester City, Real Madrid and Barcelona as potential destinations. Haaland was speaking after scoring twice for Dortmund as they beat Freiburg 5-1 at Signal Iduna Park. Thomas Meunier also got a double, with Mahmoud Dahoud adding a fifth late on.

1/15/2022,"Rafael Benítez has claimed he agreed to Anwar El Ghazi’s transfer from Aston Villa after being convinced of the winger’s desire to join Everton. The Everton manager wants to strengthen in central midfield but landed the winger on a five-month loan, with an option to buy, after he became “part of the deal with [Lucas] Digne when we started negotiations”. Benítez would not be drawn on whether the signing was imposed on him by Farhad Moshiri, or influenced by an agent close to the club’s majority shareholder, but insisted he was involved in deciding Everton’s third incoming player of the window.  Benítez, when asked about Moshiri’s role in the transfer, said: “To be fair, with the Covid situation, with injuries and also [Alex] Iwobi away from here for nearly one month [at the Africa Cup of Nations] it was an opportunity. If there is a player on loan, with quality, that wants to come and who wants to prove himself, then maybe it is a win-win situation. That was the idea. “I was talking with the player to be sure he was keen to come, and he has the desire to do well for us, and he was quite positive. In the end, hopefully he can improve our squad.” He added: “I was talking with the player to be sure he has commitment and wanted to come. That was, for me, the key part of the negotiation.” Everton visit bottom-placed Norwich on Saturday having won once in the Premier League since 25 September. Benítez had lunch with Moshiri on Thursday and, despite the team’s dreadful form, claims their talks remain positive. “We talked about what we did in the transfer window, what we would like to do, if it is possible, what we would like to do in the future, the stadium – so a lot of things about the future of the club,” Benítez said. “It was quite positive. Normally he is quite positive. “The main thing for us, for anyone as a manager, is to win games and do well. In terms of what we have done, they can see a lot of things we are improving for the present and for the future. At the same time we want to win. He is quite positive in terms of, if we do well now, our future will be bright.”",Sport/Football,El Ghazi’s desire to join Everton convinced Benítez to agree deal,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/14/el-ghazis-desire-to-join-everton-convinced-benitez-to-agree-deal
