3/7/2022,"A former NATO commander said Vladimir Putin could be the ""best thing"" to happen to the security organization. James Stavridis said Putin's aggression in Ukraine pushed Germany to increase its defense budget within 48 hours. Stavridis told MSNBC he couldn't convince Germany to do the same during his four-year tenure. Former North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Supreme Allied Commander James Stavridis said on Sunday that President Vladimir Putin may be ""the best thing that ever happened"" to NATO, explaining that the Russian leader's invasion of Ukraine has prompted the West to bolster its defenses. Stavridis, who served as NATO commander from 2009 to 2013, cited Germany's recent boost in defense spending — announced days after Putin declared an assault on Ukraine — in an interview with MSNBC's Jonathan Capehart. ""I spent four years as Supreme Allied Commander of NATO. At every conference, every meeting of high-level NATO officials, I would find my way to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and the Minister of Defense, Ursula von der Leye,"" Stavridis said. ""And I would say to them: You've got to raise your defense spending. And I got nowhere in four years."" ""In 48 hours, Vladimir Putin has inspired the Germans to effectively nearly double their defense budget — a smart move on the part of Germans,"" Stavridis continued. ""Vladimir Putin may be the best thing that ever happened to the NATO alliance,"" he told Capehart. Germany, Europe's largest economy, announced on February 27 that it would create a special one-off fund of 100 billion euros for military spending. Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the country's year-on-year defense budget moving forward would be ""more than 2% of our GDP,"" reversing a recent decline in German military spending. Scholz said that the extra funds were for Germany's ""own security"" and to fulfill its NATO obligations. Stavridis told The New York Times on Friday that the established global system was like a battered car that was out-of-date and ""could use a good tune-up."" ""But it is still on the road, rolling along, and, ironically enough, Vladimir Putin has done more in a week to energize it than anything I can remember,"" he said. The retired four-star admiral on Sunday said he thought Putin was ""highly unlikely"" to use nuclear weapons or cross swords directly with NATO. ""When you end up in a conventional conflict, the NATO alliance outspends Russia 15 to one. We have a four-to-one advantage in ground troops. We have a five-to-one advantage in combat aircraft, [a] six-to-one advantage of warships,"" he said. ""He's not going to pick a fight with the NATO alliance.""

3/7/2022,"Russian President Vladimir Putin isn't acting irrationally in his invasion of Ukraine, but he made several flawed assumptions beforehand based on bad information and wishful thinking, Andrei Kozyrev, foreign minister of Russia from 1991 to 1996, argued on Twitter Sunday. On Ukraine, Putin has long believed the country is not really a country at all and, ""at best, should be a satellite state,"" Kozyrev writes. His hopes for indirect control of Ukraine were dashed in 2014's Maidan uprising, so force was his only other option, and ""he also started to believe his own propagandists that Ukraine is run by a Nazi-Bandera junta."" So, ""if you believe all three of the above to be true and your goal is to restore the glory of the Russian Empire (whatever that means), then it is perfectly rational to invade Ukraine,"" Kozyrev argues. ""He miscalculated on all three, but that doesn't make him insane. Simply wrong and immoral."" Read his entire thread to see how Kozyrev arrives at concluding Putin won't use nukes.

3/7/2022,"By Dan Williams and Maayan Lubell JERUSALEM (Reuters) -Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett met Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin on Saturday to discuss the war in Ukraine and later spoke by phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Bennett's spokesperson said. Bennett is coordinating his efforts in the crisis with the United States, France and Germany, an Israeli official said. After his meeting with Putin, Bennett headed to Berlin for talks with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, his spokesperson said. French President Emmanuel Macron had spoken to Bennett before he flew to Moscow to brief him on his own conversations with Putin, the Elysée Palace said. ""They will stay in touch with the aim of obtaining a ceasefire, and this in coordination with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz,"" an Elysée official said. Israel, at the behest of Zelenskiy, has offered to mediate in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, though officials have previously played down expectations of any breakthrough. In their three-hour meeting in the Kremlin, the Israeli official said, Bennett also raised with Putin the issue of the large Jewish community caught up in the war in Ukraine. Israel will send medical teams to Ukraine next week to set up a field hospital that will provide treatment for refugees, its Health Ministry said. While Israel, a close ally of the United States, has condemned the Russian invasion, voiced solidarity with Kyiv and sent humanitarian aid to Ukraine, it has said it will maintain contact with Moscow in the hope of helping to ease the crisis. Israel, home to a substantial population of immigrants from the former Soviet Union, is also mindful of Moscow's military support for President Bashar al-Assad in next-door Syria, where Israel regularly attacks Iranian and Hezbollah military targets. Communication with Moscow prevents Russian and Israeli forces trading fire by accident. Bennett and Putin also discussed the ongoing talks between world powers, including Russia, and Iran about reviving a 2015 nuclear deal. Russia said on Saturday that Western sanctions imposed on it over its invasion of Ukraine had become a stumbling block for the Iran nuclear deal. Israel opposes any revival of the deal. Bennett, a religious Jew, flew to Moscow in violation of Sabbath law because Judaism permits this when the aim is to preserve human life, his spokesperson said. He was accompanied by his Ukrainian-born housing minister, Zeev Elkin. Elkin had in the past accompanied former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu as an interpreter in his talks with Putin.
