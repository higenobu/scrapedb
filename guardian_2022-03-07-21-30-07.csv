3/7/2022,"In a speech to Republican donors in New Orleans, Donald Trump said the US should put the Chinese flag on F-22 jets and “bomb the shit out of Russia” in retribution for its invasion of Ukraine. The Washington Post reported the remarks, which were made on Saturday night. To laughter, the paper said, the former president said: “And then we say, ‘China did it, we didn’t do it, China did it,’ and then they start fighting with each other and we sit back and watch.” According to the Post, Trump also called Nato a “paper tiger”, said the US military had won “skirmishes” against Russian troops while he was president, and claimed to have been tougher on Vladimir Putin than any other US leader. Trump has faced severe criticism for praising the Russian leader since the invasion began. He has also said the invasion was wrong. In his speech to “about 250 of the Republican party’s top donors at the elite Four Seasons” hotel, the Post said, Trump echoed GOP talking points against Joe Biden, claiming Putin would not have invaded Ukraine if he, Trump, had still been in power. “I knew Putin very well,” Trump said. “He would not have done it. He would have never done it.” Russia interfered in the 2016 US election to benefit Trump. The investigation of that interference produced criminal convictions of Trump aides and extensive evidence Trump may have attempted to obstruct justice. As president, in Helsinki in July 2018, Trump deferred to Putin in public and met with him in private, without close aides. In 2019, Trump held up military aid to Ukraine in an attempt to get dirt on Biden, resulting in the first of two impeachments. “Nobody has ever been tougher on Russia than me,” Trump said in New Orleans. The Post reported that Trump also praised Kim Jong-un, the North Korean dictator, for having “total control” of his country. Much of the rest of the speech, the paper said, was devoted to Trump’s lie that his defeat by Biden was caused by electoral fraud. Trump attacked two Republicans who have rejected the lie: the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, whom Trump called “stupid, corrupt”, and his own former vice-president, Mike Pence, who presided over certification of electoral results after the deadly riot at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021. The Post reported that “several” people said Trump talked too long and “sounded like he was rambling more in the last 30 minutes”. Under legal pressure over his business and political affairs, Trump seems set to run again in 2024. He remains the dominant presence in polls of the potential field. In New Orleans, he said of the next nominee: “I wonder who that might be.” According to the Post, “the crowd broke out in ‘Trump!’ chants.”",News/US news,Trump: US should put Chinese flags on F-22 jets and ‘bomb shit out of’ Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/07/donald-trump-russia-ukraine-jets-chinese
3/7/2022,"Britain is internationally notorious for the frosty reception it usually gives to subtitled foreign television. Although things have changed a little thanks to Netflix, we are historically a country that gives short shrift to anything we have to read as well as watch. At any other point in history, nobody would care that Channel 4 had just bought a subtitled seven-year-old political comedy. But the subtitled seven-year-old political comedy Channel 4 has bought happens to be Servant of the People, the show that launched the political career of the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. As such, it is suddenly appointment viewing. This is because, for one thing, Servant of the People is now an important historical document. When people talk about Zelenskiy in the future – and they will, deservedly, in the highest terms – they will struggle to draw a line between the unfathomably brave political figure who inspired global hope in the face of unthinkable destruction and the Paddington-voicing Dancing with the Stars contestant he once was. Servant of the People is that line. It’s a show about an unlikely figure (a put-upon school teacher) who, against all odds, becomes the Ukrainian president after an establishment-upsetting populist election victory. He’s thrown in at the deep end, but gradually wins over his staff, the media and the general population with his face-value honesty. In real life, the series was a runaway hit. Then, three years into the show, Zelenskiy formed a new real-life political party called Servant of the People, ran for president and won. The rest is history. As such, Servant of the People exists as a kind of prediction of Zelenskiy’s origin story. It is extraordinary, and there aren’t many western equivalents. You could point at Boris Johnson’s appearances on Have I Got News For You, except that he was already a serving MP at the time. Maybe Meghan, Duchess of Sussex’s former career on Suits, except that marrying a prince isn’t the same as leading an entire country through a foreign invasion. Perhaps Donald Trump’s stint on The Apprentice comes closest, except that his TV persona was quickly revealed to be a sham once he gained power. Zelenskiy, meanwhile, has exceeded all expectations. That is one reason why you will want to watch Servant of the People. The second, happier reason to watch is that it’s actually good. It’s a smart, engaging, well-acted satire with a light touch and a clear point of view. In the pilot, we watch the rise of Zelenskiy’s character in flashback. A schlubby teacher unleashes a sweary rant about the state of Ukrainian politics at a colleague while, unbeknown to him, a student secretly records it and puts it on YouTube. Millions watch, and a crowdfunder is launched to pay for the election costs. Then, after a shadowy cabal of string-pullers decide to forgo their usual election tactics in favour of “uncontrolled democracy”, he wins. I have only seen the first handful of episodes – despite the full show having run for three years – so I don’t know if Servant of the People gains teeth as time goes on, but it’s best viewed as a human story about how sudden fame changes people. Old colleagues who harboured semi-justified resentments towards Zelenskiy’s character suddenly fawn over him now that he’s in power. His family start to see the title rather than the man. He is properly listened to for the first time in his life, and quickly has to discover where his limits lie. This is all sold through Zelenskiy’s performance. He is uncertain and vulnerable – and endlessly charming. If you only know the man through the morale-boosting videos he has been posting since the invasion began, it will be hard to recognise; the fictional wobbliness has been replaced by unshakeable determination. But, as an early demonstration of charisma by a figure who has arguably become the world’s most admired man, Servant of the People is much more important than it ever set out to be.  Servant of the People is on All 4 now.",Arts/Television & radio,Zelenskiy’s Servant of the People: the TV show that made Ukraine’s president,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/07/zelinskiys-servant-of-the-people-the-tv-show-that-made-ukraines-president
3/7/2022,"This film began life as a documentary about kidnaps for ransom, fuelled by narco violence in northern Mexico. But when cartels started following Belgian-Romanian director Teodora Mihai around she changed tack, turning her material into drama – working with Mexican scriptwriter Habacuc Antonio de Rosario. Still, the film’s nonfictional beginnings perhaps explain why Mihai tells her story not so much as a thriller but as a naturalistic-looking drama, intelligent and mostly absorbing. It’s inspired by true events, fictionalising the story of Miriam Rodríguez Martínez, a mother who hunted down the people responsible for the kidnap and murder of her 14-year-old daughter. Arcelia Ramírez is outstanding as Cielo, a middle-aged woman whose daughter Laura goes missing. The next day a smirking, menacing young man called El Puma (Daniel Garcia), demands 150,000 pesos “if you want to see your daughter again.” With her ex-husband Gustavo (Álvaro Guerrero), she cobbles the money together, hands over a brown envelope and a brand new truck. But instead of returning Laura, El Puma delivers another ultimatum. Cielo’s ex-husband gives a fatalistic shrug and withdraws into grief. The cops can’t help her, or won’t. At a morgue Cielo views the bodies of two decapitated young women – thrown out of a truck on to the street among morning commuters. Neither is her daughter. No one wants to get involved, but Cielo’s resolve hardens. She turns detective, tracking the cartel members down, beginning with a woman known as Commander Inez (Alessandra Goñi Bucio). There’s an observational style to the camerawork, watchful of Cielo, giving the movie a documentary-like feel. At times it lacks heat and energy, but Ramírez’s performance is compelling. Cielo is methodical in her investigation, but reckless about her own safety. In moments of danger she is terrified. But the worst thing has already happened; what more can the cartels do to her? This is a brilliantly realistic nightmare that stays believable right up to the end.  La Civil is released on 14 March on digital platforms.",Arts/Film,La Civil review – compelling cartel kidnap drama with a vérité edge,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/07/la-civil-review-compelling-cartel-kidnap-drama-with-a-verite-edge
3/7/2022,"People who do not spend their days reading climate reports or scouring the archives of oil companies are often surprised to hear that the fossil-fuel industry has been part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) since its inception. And it’s not just the IPCC. Oil companies have been involved in the entire international effort on climate change since it began in the late 1980s – and here’s a pro tip: they’re there for a reason, and it’s not decarbonisation. The second part of the IPCC’s most recent report was published last week, and it finally acknowledged the oil industry’s biggest contribution to the climate space thus far: misinformation. This was followed closely by another new-to-the-IPCC topic: maladaptation, which refers to measures ostensibly geared towards warding off climate change, but which “may lead to increased risk of adverse climate-related outcomes, including via increased greenhouse gas emissions, increased or shifted vulnerability to climate change, more inequitable outcomes, or diminished welfare”, according to the IPCC. The report points to “green gentrification” – the introduction of green spaces to a neighbourhood, which can increase property value and push low-income residents out – as an example of a measure that “offers nature-based solutions to the few”. Whether an action is maladapted can depend on context, the report’s authors add, for instance, air conditioning can reduce risk for the individual but is maladaptive at a societal level. The report’s authors did not draw a connection between misinformation and maladaptation, opting instead to assert that maladaptation is often unintended. Yet an increasing number of peer-reviewed studies point to the fossil-fuel industry’s fingerprints on that particular problem as well, thanks to the role it plays as a primary funder of university research on not only climate science, but also policy and economics, as well as its penchant for greenwashing solutions that don’t work, or that work only for the few. IPCC authors were more direct when it came to misinformation. The North America summary notes that “misinformation about climate science … has sowed uncertainty, and impeded [the public’s] recognition of risk”. A few paragraphs later, it adds that both misinformation and “politicisation” of the science are “delaying urgent adaptation planning and implementation”. But the closest it gets to taking the next step and naming the source of misinformation – oil companies – is to vaguely note that “vested interests have generated rhetoric and misinformation that undermines climate science and disregards risk and urgency”. This is the first time the IPCC has mentioned misinformation in its reports. Why? Maybe it’s because the panel has finally included social scientists, who have the receipts on those “vested interests” and may be more willing to push back against them. If you’re wondering why they’ve included oil company staffers since 1988, but only recently let social scientists in … good question. To answer it, we have to go back in time a bit. The year 1972 was a big one for international environmental affairs, thanks to the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (UNCHE), which produced the Stockholm declaration. This groundbreaking document made environmental issues global, emphasising conservation, the redistribution of resources, and state responsibility for environmental damage both within and beyond borders. It also contained little to no consideration of business interests. “To the extent that industry was included at all in the UNCHE negotiations, it was as a culprit and a threat,” Melissa Aronczyk and Maria Espinoza write in their recent book, A Strategic Nature. Combined with an explosion in environmental regulations all over the world (from 1970 to 1972 alone, the US created the Environmental Protection Agency and passed the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act and National Environmental Policy Act) the Stockholm declaration was a huge wake-up call to industry that the world was taking this environmental stuff seriously. They were caught a bit flat-footed – but not for long. By 1988, a handful of oil companies and trade groups were involved in the IPCC process. Their numbers grew every year, as did their prominence, and they moved from being observers and reviewers to authors. By 1998, Brian Flannery, a former climate modeller and then manager at ExxonMobil and a key part of the company’s shift from researching climate change to casting doubt on climate science, was lead author of the “Working Group III” assessment in the IPCC’s third report. The group works on mitigation – actually reducing CO2 emissions – definitely not something you want an Exxon guy in charge of, especially during the company’s peak climate-denial years. Flannery took the lead on Working Group III for the fourth report, too, which was published in 2007. In the 20 years between the UNCHE and the 1992 Rio Earth summit, which was the precursor to what we now call the Conference of Parties or COP events, the business community fully infiltrated international discussions on environmental issues and successfully moved the goalposts. Gone was the emphasis on government regulation, replaced by a sort of big-tent approach that included business interests and prioritised compromise. “Some enlightened leaders of enterprises are already implementing ‘responsible care’ and product stewardship policies and programmes,” Agenda 21, one of the defining documents to come out of the 1992 Rio summit, noted approvingly. “A positive contribution of business and industry, including transnational corporations, to sustainable development can increasingly be achieved by using economic instruments such as free market mechanisms.” That shift in tone, from regulation in 1972 to compromise in 1992, is a crucial one, because the Rio Earth summit also produced the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC), which informed the creation of the IPCC and its reports, as well as every international climate agreement since. In contrast to the 1972 convening, the UN encouraged business-community participation in 1992 – and industry groups were happy to comply. They drafted their own “sustainable development charter” to bring to Rio. “And as you can imagine, this charter did not contain anything that would have really transformed how companies did business,” Aronczyk says. “It was a very business-as-usual document, but it paid a lot of lip service to the idea of going green, of being sustainable, being very concerned about the environment. And because they got out in front of the actual conference, they were really able to put that document forward and stave off other kinds of more binding legislation or more draconian regulations that would have caused problems for these companies’ profits.” Social scientists have been arguing for decades that the biggest obstacle to climate action is not a lack of scientific understanding or data, but a lack of political will. It was only after producing a growing mountain of peer-reviewed literature, and convincing many atmospheric scientists of their value as well, that they were finally included and, it seems, listened to. So it is that we would go another nearly 30 years before the IPCC would warn the world about climate change with the kind of urgency that accompanied its 2018 report, or point to industry-fuelled efforts like misinformation and maladaptation today. Many are now eagerly awaiting the Working Group III report, which is due out in April and includes the most input from social scientist authors … but was reviewed by a Chevron staffer, naturally.

3/7/2022,"I’m a Russian. Vladimir Putin is committing monstrous crimes in the name of my people, my country, and me. Putin is not Russia. Russia is hurt and ashamed. In the name of my Russia and my people I beg the Ukrainians’ forgiveness. Yet I realise that nothing being done there can be forgiven. This war did not begin just now but in 2014, with Putin’s seizure of Crimea. The western world refused to understand the gravity of this and pretended nothing terrible was going on. All these years I’ve been trying in my statements and publications to explain to people just who Putin is. It hasn’t worked. And now Putin himself has explained it to everyone. Whenever one of my articles is published in the press in Switzerland, where I live, the editors receive letters of outrage from people at the Russian embassy in Berne. They’re silent now. Maybe they’re packing their bags and applying for political asylum? I want to return to Russia. But which Russia? In Putin’s Russia it’s impossible to breathe. The stench from the policeman’s boot is too strong. I will return to my country. As I wrote in an open letter when I refused to represent Putin’s Russia at an international event back in 2013, before Crimea was annexed: “I want to and will represent another Russia, my Russia, free of impostors, a country with a state structure that defends not the right to corruption but the rights of the individual, a country with free media, free elections, and free people.” The space for free expression in Russia was restricted to the internet long ago, but now even there we see military censorship. The authorities have announced that all critical statements regarding Russia and its war will be considered treason and punished according to martial law. What can a writer do? The only thing he can: speak out clearly. Silence means support for the aggressor. In the 19th century, rebellious Poles fought Russian tsarism “for your freedom and ours”. Now the Ukrainians are fighting Putin’s army for their freedom and ours. They are defending not only their own human dignity but the dignity of all humanity. We must help in every way we can. The regime’s crime is also that the stain of disgrace has fallen on the entire country. Now Russia is associated not with Russian literature and music but with children under bombardment. Putin’s crime is that he has poisoned people with hate. Putin will go away, but the pain and hate may linger in people’s souls for a long time. Only art, literature, and culture can help overcome this trauma. Sooner or later, the dictator’s foul, useless life will end, but culture continues as it always has and as it will after Putin. Literature does not have to be about Putin. Literature does not have to explain war. War can’t be explained. Why do people order soldiers of one nation to kill those of another? Literature is what opposes war. True literature is always about the human being’s need for love, not hate. What lies ahead? At best, there will not be a nuclear war. I fervently hope the madman will not be allowed to press the red button or that one of his flunkies will refuse to carry out this final order. But this is seemingly the sole good thing in the offing. After Putin, the Russian Federation will cease to exist on the map as a country. The process of the empire’s collapse will continue. Chechnya’s independence will be followed by that of other peoples and regions. A struggle for power will ensue. The populace will have no wish to live in chaos, and the demand for a firm hand will strengthen once again. Even in the freest elections – if there are any – a new dictator may come to power. And the west will support him because he will promise to watch over the red button. And who knows? One day this may happen all over again.

3/7/2022,"A 75-year-old British man was trapped in Qatar for more than seven years when he was refused permission to leave after a business dispute. Ranald Crook, who is back in Gloucestershire, was even forbidden to fly home for his father’s funeral as a result of the travel ban, imposed after two influential Qatari brothers took legal action against him. Abdulhadi Awjan al-Hajri and Hamad Awjan al-Hajri were brought in as sponsors of the construction company Geosan/Construction Dynamics, of which Crook was the general manager, because Qatari law at the time dictated that any business there must be at least 51% locally owned. Crook said the brothers’ role was to solve local problems but when they failed to live up to expectations they were replaced, prompting a succession of legal cases against him, which he invariably won, only for a new one to be launched each time so that the travel ban was maintained. “I assumed when the first court case came out we would go through it and that would be that,” said Crook. “Because we had two brothers who were partners, when that case was thrown out they then started exactly the same case again in the other brother’s name, which they can do. “And then they made criminal accusations against me. You always think that sense will prevail but that’s wrong. People need to go into Qatar with their eyes open.” The first case was lodged in August 2014 and Crook would not be able to leave until 20 December 2021 – seven years, 11 months and 15 days after he was last in the UK. He faced two civil cases and two criminal cases, all of which went to multiple appeals, estimating that he attended more than 50 court hearings. He was victorious on each occasion but claims the cases were an abuse of the court system. Crook said that at the outset of the litigation he and his wife cancelled her residence permit, otherwise she too would have had a travel ban imposed. As a result they spent lengthy periods apart and he could not accompany her back to the UK when she required an urgent hip operation. But he said missing his father’s funeral in 2015, after a court refused to waive the ban, caused him the greatest pain. “It was the worst day of my life,” he said. “I wrote a eulogy for my son to read out but on the day, it was knowing that he was there, my wife was there, and my relatives – I will never forget it.” As unfortunate as his situation was, Crook acknowledges that there are poor workers from developing countries in Qatar, which will host this year’s World Cup, in a far worse plight, without the resources he had to attempt to fight back. When the second criminal case was brought he said he spent a night in police cells with men who appeared to be Pakistani workers. “After hearing their stories I wondered if they would ever be released,” he said. “They had problems with immigration status, or sponsors trying to screw money out of them.” Crook had harsh words for the British government who he says were slow to act and told him they did not consider he had suffered a loss of human rights. He said: “At the same time, Qatari nationals are investing billions in the UK, with stakes in Barclays bank, Sainsbury’s, Canary Wharf, Heathrow airport, Harrods and the Shard. The real story here is that the UK is nervous of upsetting a state which is bankrolling many projects that are key to our economy.” A Foreign Office spokesperson said consular staff provided support. Hamad Awjan al-Hajri declined to comment.

3/7/2022,"Good morning. Volodymr Zelenskiy has vowed to punish “every bastard” who committed atrocities during the invasion of Ukraine amid outrage at Russia’s shelling of civilians as they tried to flee a town on the outskirts of Kyiv, killing a young family. The president of Ukraine said in a video address last night: “They were just trying to get out of town. To escape. The whole family. How many such families have died in Ukraine? We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will punish everyone who committed atrocities in this war.” Ukraine has also criticised a proposal by Moscow to open refugee corridors as “completely immoral” after the Russian defence ministry announced that civilians fleeing some cities would only be allowed to leave for Belarus or Russia. Meanwhile, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, issued a pledge yesterday to increase pressure on Russia through sanctions and provide more aid to Ukraine. What else did Blinken say? He warned that Russia held a military advantage that western allies were finding hard to counter and the war was likely to last “some time”. What else is happening? A plane carrying Russian diplomats expelled by the US left John F Kennedy airport in New York en route to Moscow. Here’s everything we know so far today. If Ukraine holds on as Putin’s bombardments grow more barbarous, will the western powers belatedly come to their rescue? Simon Tisdall argues Nato should act now to stop the slaughter. A long line of huge semi-articulated trucks, recreational vehicles and cars was circling Washington DC, yesterday, in preparation for what their protesting drivers have pledged will be a week of traffic disruption around the US capital aligned around a loose collection of demands, including the end to all coronavirus pandemic-related restrictions. From its temporary base at a speedway vehicle racing site in Hagerstown, 80 miles north-west in Maryland, organizers of what they term the “people’s convoy” of about 1,000 vehicles have said they plan to welcome the new work week by driving slowly around Washington on the already notoriously congested Beltway, or ring road, at the minimum legal speed in an attempt to get their message across to national politicians. The convoy, a spin-off of trucker protests further north that have snarled Ottawa and disrupted Canadian transport arteries to the US, began assembling in California last week. As it has made its way east, it has picked up similarly mobile, ideologically aligned, fellow travelers along the way. But aren’t pandemic restrictions easing anyway as the most recent surge of infections subsides? Yes. The changing circumstances is prompting convoy organizers to adapt their demands to a more free-ranging basket of aspirations and motives. Are they planning to enter the city? It remains unclear if the convoy plans to drive into the small area occupied by Washington, or snarl masses of government workers and lawmakers on their morning and evening Beltway road commutes. The decision not to seek re-election is deeply personal and political. But as the party braces for a grueling midterm election in November, a rising number of House Democrats are opting not to return to Congress next year. On Monday, the Florida congressman Ted Deutch announced that he would not seek re-election, bringing the total number of Democratic departures from the House so far this cycle to 31. It’s a worrying trend for Democrats. Congressional retirements are often an early sign of a wave election – for the other party. In 2018, dozens of House Republicans did not seek re-election, including the then House majority leader, Paul Ryan. The party lost 41 seats that year, and Democrats gained control of the chamber, in an election cycle widely viewed as a referendum on Donald Trump. What have the Republicans said about the trend? They see it as a sign that Democrats’ hopes of keeping their majority are fading. “Their majority is doomed,” Mike Berg said recently. “Retire or lose.” Scott David, one of the jurors in Ghislaine Maxwell’s trial, faces questioning under oath on Tuesday about his answers to a jury selection question about sexual abuse. David revealed in a newspaper interview he was a survivor of sexual abuse – sparking a chain of events that could potentially undermine the trial’s outcome. More than 4,300 people have been arrested after demonstrators took to the streets in 21 Russian cities to condemn Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Meanwhile, TikTok has imposed restrictions on its service in Russia, and Netflix has suspended streaming, after the Kremlin criminalizes reporting of Ukraine invasion. A Texas congresswoman has called for Russia to release Brittney Griner as fears grow Vladimir Putin could use the US basketball star as a pawn during the war in Ukraine. The two-time Olympic champion has been detained after vape cartridges containing hashish oil were allegedly found in her luggage. People who have a rosy outlook on the world may live healthier, longer lives because they have fewer stressful events to cope with, research suggests. Scientists found optimists fared better emotionally because they had fewer stressful events in their daily lives. Part of the US government’s Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (Isap), a private enterprise BI runs a surveillance system launched in 2004 and pitched as a way to keep immigrants out of detention centers while they await a court hearing on their legal status. BI claims it provides immigrant tracking and ‘high quality’ case management. A Guardian investigation paints a very different picture. As big names from Angelina Jolie to Sean Penn and Mark Ruffalo issue their support for besieged Ukraine, Hollywood must be cringing at the days when a public appearance with Putin wasn’t beyond the pale. By the mid-00s, Russia had become an important emerging film market, and firmly on the celebrity junket circuit. Photo ops with big stars also worked in Putin’s favor, helping normalize his rogue state in the eyes of the world. The US beef industry has escaped “relatively unscathed” from Joe Biden’s attempts to curb greenhouse gas emissions, according to leaders at the industry’s recent CattleCon convention. Biden and the EU announced a global pledge to cut methane gas 30% by 2030 at November’s Cop26 climate summit – but industry leaders have expressed relief about the administration choosing to incentivize rather than force ranchers and feedlots to reduce emissions. Predictions of dark forces being unleashed by an evil vixen hung over social media in Japan today after a famous volcanic rock said to kill anyone who comes into contact with it was found split in two. Its separation into two roughly equal parts, believed to have occurred within the past few days, has spooked online users who noted that, according to folklore, the stone continually spews poisonous gas – hence its name.

3/7/2022,"In a surprise U-turn, the government of Georgia has applied for EU membership just days after declaring it would not accelerate its application, as fears grow among the Georgian public that the Russian invasion might not stop with Ukraine. A day after Ukraine made its formal application for EU membership on Wednesday, Georgia responded to the pressure of overwhelming public protests and made its own request, along with Moldova. In 2008 Vladimir Putin ordered a Russian invasion of Georgia in a campaign that killed hundreds of Georgians, displaced more than 190,000 and resulted in the Russian occupation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which continues to this day. By signing the formal application for EU membership on Thursday, the Georgian prime minister, Irakli Garibashvili, moved up the original timetable, under which Georgia’s application for EU membership would start in 2024. Only on Tuesday, the chair of the ruling Georgian Dream party, Irakli Kobakhidze, had told journalists that speeding up Georgia’s application to the EU “could be counterproductive because we have to satisfy certain terms over the [next] two years”. The Georgian government had also previously announced that it would not join international voices calling for sanctions against Russia. “I want to state clearly and unambiguously, considering our national interests and interests of the people, Georgia does not plan to participate in the financial and economic sanctions, as this would only damage our country and populace more,” Garibashvili said last week. Since then, the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, has seen nightly protests, with tens of thousands of people taking to the streets in a show of solidarity with Ukraine and to call for Garibashvili’s resignation over what they consider a weak response to Russian aggression. The Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, has accused Georgia of “holding an immoral position regarding sanctions” and recalled the Ukrainian ambassador to Georgia. Founded by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, the Georgian Dream party is widely criticised for presiding over corruption, democratic backsliding and harbouring sympathy for Russian policies. Its reluctance to impose sanctions against Russia has been seen as evidence of the party’s alignment with Putin’s regime. “In this battle between Russia and the free world, today Georgia has a government that stands on the side of Russia,” MP Salome Samadashvili has said. On Saturday, Mikhail Fishman, a prominent journalist at Russia’s independent TV Rain, which was taken off air by the Kremlin last week, was denied entry to Georgia even though his family and other Russians on his flight were reportedly allowed in. Thursday’s announcement marks a volte-face, with Kobakhidze calling for EU bodies to review Georgia’s EU application “in an emergency manner and to make the decision to grant Georgia the status of an EU membership candidate”. While the EU petition will appease some of the protesters, many observers are wary of interpreting the government’s U-turn as a sign of fully abandoning Russia and turning toward the west. Applying for EU membership is a lengthy process with no guarantee of success, and could fly under Putin’s radar while the Ukraine invasion continues, allowing Georgia in effect to hedge its bets. “There was public pressure and petitions signed by thousands. They also knew Moldova would apply. The Georgian government saw this as a window of opportunity: if they missed it, the Georgian people wouldn’t tolerate it,” said Kornely Kakachia, head of the thinktank Georgian Institute of Politics. “The Georgian government is playing realpolitik. They don’t know what the outcome of this war will be. And anyway, the Kremlin is busy now.” Last week hundreds of Georgian volunteers were prevented from boarding a Ukrainian charter flight headed for Kyiv after the Georgian government blocked the plane from landing in Tbilisi. The plane was intended to deliver Georgian volunteers to Ukraine to join an international brigade fighting against Russian forces in the country. Recent events have accelerated a growing divide between the Georgian government and its presidency under Salome Zourabichvili, who is publicly moving away from Russia. On Tuesday, after Georgian Dream said it would not expedite its EU application, Zourabichvili met in Brussels with the presidents of the European Commission and European Council, Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, to call for the speedier reception of aspiring EU nations. “You can try to frighten countries,” Zourabichvili said on CNN on Thursday. “But that doesn’t mean you change their orientation, that you change their determination to keep their independence.”",News/World news,Georgia speeds up EU application in policy U-turn,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/georgia-expedites-eu-application-in-policy-u-turn-russia-ukraine
3/7/2022,"In September 1988, Bronwyn was living in Brooklyn, New York, presenting a popular show on WFMU, an independent community radio station. “I played a lot of different music and wrote my own material, which included an obituary section called News of the Dead,” she says. One day, after Bronwyn finished recording, the station manager showed her a comic strip submitted for the station’s programme guide. “When I glanced at the comic I thought the art looked great.” When she read the strip, she realised it was about her. “It included all these drawings of women, trying to guess what kind of woman I was. The final panel was a picture of the artist walking across a desert, asking if I’d marry him,” she laughs. “If he’d sent fan mail, I might have thought he was nuts, but I knew it was a flattering joke because it was sent to the programme guide, not me.” Sean, who drew the strip, was living in Brooklyn and working as an illustrator. “I was a huge fan of her show,” he says. “She was so eclectic in her politics, like me. A friend of mine was a volunteer for the programme guide. When he asked me to draw something, I decided to focus on her show.” Bronwyn called the number on the business card attached to the strip to thank him. “He didn’t pick up so I left a message on his answering machine and asked if he’d like to join a group of my friends at an experimental folk music show that night on the Lower East Side.” When Sean returned home and got the message, he was astonished by the invitation. “I had only just come back from Manhattan, but I found the cleanest shirt I had and went straight back into the city.” When they met, things were a little awkward at first. “I knew lots about her from the show, and she knew nothing about me, so it was a strange dynamic,” he says. Bronwyn says he was “more conventional-looking” than she had expected. “My friend said he was cute but I wasn’t sure.” They shared a lift home and began to get to know one another better. “That’s when we really warmed up to each other and exchanged phone numbers,” she says. The next day he called her and they talked for three hours. “He was really grilling me,” she says, laughing. “I thought he was either ready to get serious in a relationship or out of his mind.” After the call they arranged to meet at a bar in Brooklyn that night. Again, they talked for hours, realising how much they had in common. “It was 4.30am and I realised I was so attracted to her. We meshed so quickly,” says Sean. Bronwyn felt the same. “There was this mental, emotional connection. We’re both weird in similar ways.” Bronwyn was recently single and Sean was casually dating several women. “I told him he had to get rid of his girlfriends before I would go out with him,” she says. By October, were a couple, and spent their time going to underground clubs in New York, and visiting museums and art galleries. They married in Brooklyn in March 1991 and moved to their current home in Hastings-on-Hudson soon afterwards. Throughout their relationship, Sean has supported Bronwyn with the difficulties she experiences with prosopagnosia, or face blindness – the inability to recognise people’s faces. “It’s been challenging all my life, made me socially awkward and restricted my employment opportunities,” she says. “Sean has been wonderful because he’s like my seeing-face guide. He helps me to know who I’m talking to. I could never watch movies because I lost track of who’s who, but he’s able to explain them for me.” She also loves his talent and kindness. “He’s so reliable and goodhearted. I admire that a lot.” Sean says they “haven’t stopped talking” since they met. “She’s way smarter than me and we are both quirky, in a way that made us feel desperately alone in the crowd before we met. But we really understand each other.” Want to share your story?

3/7/2022,"Dua Lipa is facing a second copyright lawsuit over her song Levitating, less than a week after a Florida reggae band sued the singer for alleged plagiarism, Billboard reports. Songwriters L Russell Brown and Sandy Linzer allege that the opening melody to the hit single, the longest-running Top 10 song ever by a female artist on the US Billboard Hot 100, is a “duplicate” of the melody to their 1979 song Wiggle and Giggle All Night and their 1980 song Don Diablo. “Defendants have levitated away plaintiffs’ intellectual property,” lawyers for Brown and Linzer wrote in a wry complaint. “Plaintiffs bring suit so that defendants cannot wiggle out of their wilful infringement.” The songwriters highlighted interviews with Lipa, in which they said she “admitted that she deliberately emulated prior eras” and “took inspiration” from historic music for the “retro” sound of her 2020 album, Future Nostalgia. Their lawsuit claims that the “signature melody” from the introduction to Levitating copied a similar portion of their songs, and cited the popularity of that section of Levitating on TikTok as key to its success. “Because video creators frequently truncate the already brief snippets of sound on TikTok, the signature melody often comprises 50% or more of these viral videos.” The suit named Lipa, her label Warner Music Group and rapper DaBaby, who appeared on a remix of the song, along with other songwriting and production parties. “In seeking nostalgic inspiration, defendants copied plaintiffs’ creation without attribution,” Brown and Linzer claimed. Last week, Lipa was sued by the Florida band Artikal Sound System, who claimed that Levitating was so similar to their 2017 song Live Your Life that it was “highly unlikely that Levitating was created independently”. Lipa has not responded to either claim. The Guardian has contacted representatives for the singer.
