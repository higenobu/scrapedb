2/4/2022,"From the Canadian Rockies to Patagonia, pumas have the largest terrestrial range of any mammal in the Americas. Now, a new study has reported the web of life these elusive cats support, showing how they are connected to more than 485 other species, from eagles feeding on their carrion to elk impacted by their “fear effect”. Researchers reviewed 162 studies published between 1950 and 2020 looking at how pumas – also known as mountain lions or cougars – enrich ecosystems and support other species. They found the large cats contribute 1.5m kilograms of meat a day to scavenger communities across North and South America, with 281 species getting to feed on carcasses they have killed.  The paper, published in Mammal Review, also identified 203 species as puma prey; 40 that are affected by their fear of pumas; 12 that compete with pumas; and seven species that benefit from the ecosystem services they create. “We went into this thinking pumas were connected to loads of other species for a variety of reasons,” says lead author Dr Laura LaBarge from the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behaviour. “But it was so surprising when we went through the enormous range of species connected to them, especially those that are indirectly affected by pumas, like invertebrates or plants.” When pumas make a kill they act as “ecosystem engineers” because the carcass, or carrion, becomes a source of food for scavengers and decomposers. Pumas are apex carnivores (but not top carnivores) and research suggests they have adapted to allow for about a third of their food to be stolen by higher predators such as wolves and bears, meaning they are used to running off and leaving the leftovers for other wildlife. One study found that pumas in Patagonia contributed three times more carrion to the ecosystem than grey wolves in Yellowstone national park, despite living at lower densities. Another paper looking at ecosystems in Greater Yellowstone found that 215 carrion beetles feed on carcasses caught by pumas. They also affect the distribution of condors in South America and early findings suggest they have an impact on bald and golden eagles in the Rocky Mountains. Researchers found 40 species, including ungulates such as elk, white-tailed deer and vicuña, were impacted by the fear effect. Pumas are ambush hunters and tend to hunt from predictable areas, whereas wolves hunt prey over long distances. This means the fear effect – and therefore the areas ungulates avoid – is more pronounced with pumas than wolves, researchers believe. “It’s just incredible how many domino effects you can have from these large carnivores which influence the distribution of foraging animals,” says senior author Dr Mark Elbroch, an ecologist from Panthera, the global wild cat conservation organisation. “You’ve got areas on the landscape that are safe, and areas that are risky for these hoofed animals to feed, and it’s just incredible all the things that changes – plant architecture, plant communities, birds, and even the soil chemistry.” Moreover, pumas also provide ecosystem services to seven species. In North Dakota the recolonisation of pumas is thought to have saved $1bn (£740m) in deer-vehicle collisions. Pumas also reduce the incidence of some diseases in prey animals: for example deer affected by chronic wasting disease are unlikely to be able to escape from an attacking puma. Elbroch says: “Even as someone who has been studying pumas for a long time, it is still amazing to sit back and say ‘my goodness, look at how incredible this species is’ and see how interconnected it is in these ecosystems. But even to sit back for a little bit longer and say ‘wow, look at the complexity of life’, because it is truly amazing. All of these relationships are occurring all the time, all around us, so I just enjoyed the fact that this paper was a celebration of this species and a celebration of life.” There is little published research on pumas from the tropics and subtropics, which account for a third of their range, and are among the most diverse ecosystems in the world. LaBarge believes the number of connections they found in this study probably “only scratches the surface” of pumas’ true impact. Because of their elusive nature, puma populations are difficult to study. Their numbers declined drastically after European colonisation of the Americas but in the past 20 or 30 years there has been evidence of a small recovery, stabilising at about 50,000 breeding pumas globally. In South America there has never been a long-term study, but the International Union for Conservation of Nature believes numbers are declining. Pumas are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, vehicle collisions and hunting by humans. Several isolated populations suffer from low genetic diversity with “severe health consequences”, according to the paper. Researchers hope the paper will highlight the benefits of puma conservation as a public good, showing the importance of creating integrated human-wildlife ecosystems. Christian Hunt, an author of the study and representative of Defenders of Wildlife, says: “The main takeaway for me is that we simply cannot have these rich, dynamic ecosystems without these top predators. We have to protect them to protect wilderness.” Hunt believes one of the greatest challenges is to change people’s perception of pumas as scary and reduce conflicts between humans and these big cats (which are generally terrified of people), with compensation schemes for farmers and better community outreach. He says: “For us, the question is not whether pumas and people can coexist at this point. It’s a question of whether we, as an expanding society, have the grace to accommodate this animal and to leave it some room as we continue to encroach upon its habitats. I think ultimately, the puma’s future – like so many other large animals in the 21st century – is going to depend, really, on our ability to coexist and to make peace with the wild.” Kate Vannelli, a big cat specialist at WWF, who was not involved in the research, says: “This study helps to highlight how there is an interdependence between people and big cats, and big cats are inextricably tied to their landscapes, as demonstrated by the huge amount of diverse biotic relationships highlighted in this study. This integration is extremely important to acknowledge if we want to conserve big cats.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment,Top cat: why the puma is a leading influencer in the animal kingdom,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/04/why-the-puma-is-a-leading-influencer-in-the-animal-kingdom-aoe
2/4/2022,"Wealthy people have disproportionately large carbon footprints and the percentage of the world’s emissions they are responsible for is growing, a study has found. In 2010, the most affluent 10% of households emitted 34% of global CO2, while the 50% of the global population in lower income brackets accounted for just 15%. By 2015 the richest 10% were responsible for 49% of emissions against 7% produced by the poorest half of the world’s population.  Aimee Ambrose, a professor of energy policy at Sheffield Hallam University and author of the study published in the journal Science Direct, says cutting the carbon footprint of the wealthiest might be the fastest way to reach net zero. In terms of energy demand in the UK, the least wealthy half of the population accounts for less than 20% of final demand, less than the top 5% consumes. While their homes may be more energy efficient, high consumers are likely to have more space to heat. They also own and use more luxury items and gadgets. Ambrose said the cost of living crisis was likely to make those on middle to low incomes reduce their carbon consumption by holidaying in the UK, if at all, and by using less fuel. However, those who consume the most are unlikely to have to make such changes. “It is much easier for richer consumers to absorb these increases in costs without changing their behaviour,” said Ambrose. “Unlike the less wealthy, the thermostat won’t be turned down and the idea of not jetting off on a long-haul flight to find some sun is out of the question. In most countries, before Covid-19, less than half of people reported flying at least once a year while more than half of emissions from passenger aviation were linked to the 1% of people who fly most often. “In many ways, the rich are being largely insulated from the spike in energy costs,” said Ambrose. “But addressing excessive personal consumption is something that isn’t on the agenda for the government and policymakers. This is bad news for the planet and our prospects of reaching net zero.” She said the resulting policy neglect of high consumers was a “missed opportunity” to address inequality and opportunities for carbon reduction. “Price mechanisms may force low-income households to cut back consumption to dangerous levels,” Ambrose added. “Moreover, high consumption and large carbon footprints are spatially concentrated in high-income cities and suburbs – while their negative effects, such as air pollution, typically spill over into less affluent areas.”",News/Environment,"‘Carbon footprint gap’ between rich and poor expanding, study finds ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/04/carbon-footprint-gap-between-rich-poor-expanding-study
2/4/2022,"Dear fellow fans of Lee Child’s inimitable creation: all you need to know about Reacher (Amazon Prime Video), the new television series based on the books, is that for the first six and half minutes of the opening episode, Reacher says nothing. This, for the uninitiated, is both the defining feature of Jack Reacher – our ex-military police, lone-wolf hero and man-with-virtually-no-name – and a recurring line in the series of books about his violently noble and nobly violent adventures. Silence is the essence of the man. Most of the outrage surrounding the casting of Tom Cruise in the role for the two film adaptations (of the ninth and 18th books) dwelt on the fact that Reacher is a 6ft 5in, 5,250-pound wall of muscle and Cruise is … not. But it should have been at least as much about the fact that Cruise’s essential energy is that of a chirrupy people-pleaser and Reacher is living proof that a man can be an island if he just puts his mind to it.  Now, at last, we have everything. A production team that understands that, like Harry Potter fans, we need the books – precision-engineered already to deliver exactly what is expected – translated to the screen as fully and as smoothly as possible. And Alan Ritchson, an actor the size of a house and roughly as expressive unless called upon to be otherwise. He has all of Reacher’s stillness and confidence. He exudes exactly his brand of weary patience. And somehow – and of all these gifts, this one surely had the producers falling upon him in weeping gratitude – he is capable of delivering Reacher’s occasional but vital monologues about how exactly he is going to break the next seven people’s heads. The inaugural Reacher series is based, as is right and proper, on the first book in the novel sequence – Killing Floor. If you have read Killing Floor, you now know – and this is a promise of delight, not disappointment – exactly what happens in it. But, again, for the uninitiated: our enormous hero gets off a bus (on a whim – this, and drinking black coffee, is what he does) in the tiny town of Margrave, Georgia, and is quickly arrested on suspicion of murder. Now he must stay in Margrave and prove he didn’t do it. And, when he finds out who has been killed, the matter becomes a personal “find everybody responsible and kill every last one of them”. In the process, he gets put in the bad part of a prison to await arraignment and must use his finely honed fighting skills to stay alive (to see Ritchson walking serenely out of a bathroom littered with bleeding bodies is to know a very special kind of peace), befriends a lady (Reacher is allowed one lady per adventure) and forges a mutually respectful alliance with the investigating officer who is reluctantly impressed by both Reacher’s intellect and street smarts, which combine to give him almost Sherlockian powers of deduction. Ritchson’s delivery (with just a flicker of knowing humour about the eyes) of these litanies of deduction on screen recall – gloriously – the heady days of Paul Gross doing similar monologues as Constable Benton Fraser in Due South, albeit with the slightly more surreal atmosphere of the show to help him sell it. Ritchson works alone. Amazon’s take on Reacher is as solidly made as he is and delivers the rollicking yarn as efficiently as the man himself can dispatch a Glock-wielding gangster. It is great, great fun and will come as a great, great relief to the Reacher devotees who will surely – at least at first – form the bulk of viewers. It will please them endlessly but is still drawn broadly enough as a crime drama to attract others.

2/4/2022," The first of Matthew Vaughn’s Kingsman movies was an unexpected treat; a big, fun, surprisingly moving Marvel-does-Bond rollercoaster. Interest waned, however, with 2017’s Kingsman: The Golden Circle, a film so incoherent it appeared to have been assembled at speed by idiots. The newest offering, The King’s Man, is something of a soft reset. It’s a prequel, charting Ralph Fiennes’ Zelig-style journey through the events that led to world war one. There’s a lot of fun to be had spotting all the real-life historical figures dotted throughout the mayhem – Rhys Ifans, for one, appears to be having the time of his life as Rasputin. A ridiculous Kingsman v Hitler sequel awaits.Wednesday 9 February, Disney+ Michael Mann’s 2004 thriller deserves recognition not only for its pioneering cinematography – shot overwhelmingly on digital before the technology was perfected, Collateral has a gritty, pixellated immediacy – but for Tom Cruise’s white-hot thermite performance. As hired assassin Vincent, tasked with forcing nervous taxi driver Jamie Foxx to chauffeur him around Los Angeles for a night, this is Cruise using his intensity for bad rather than good for once. His shark-like evil sits in heavy contrast to the woozy, insomniac sprawl of the city around him.Saturday 5 February, 10.35pm, ITV Ken Loach’s most recent film was released in 2019, before the pandemic, but only seems to have gained urgency in the intervening years. One of his angriest films in decades, it depicts the dire working conditions doled out to professional delivery drivers: zero-hour contracts, heavy rental fees, no insurance. The toll all this takes on Kris Hitchen’s lead character is abominable. Can a project like this change the employment policies of a notoriously shoddy industry? Probably not. But once seen, you’ll never take a delivery driver for granted again.Sunday 6 February, 10pm, BBC Two Thanks to the commercial success of last year’s Godzilla vs Kong, Adam Wingard now firmly has his feet under the Hollywood table. But whatever he chooses to do next, it’s unlikely to better the panache of his 2011 break-out hit You’re Next. The joy of this cheap, grimy slasher movie is in how lightly it wears its premise. In any other hands, a story like this – about intruders in animal masks systematically offing a group of semi-likable victims – would be a gruesome sludge of a thing. Wingard, though, fills the movie with endless wit, black humour and wild invention. Beautiful.Monday 7 February, 9pm, Horror Channel Although not one for Edgar Allan Poe purists, there’s still an astonishing amount of fun to be had with Roger Corman’s 1961 adaptation. At its centre is an unhinged turn by Vincent Price as a castle-owning weirdo with a torture device in his basement. The entire performance is one long I-can’t-believe-they’re-letting-me-do-this wink to the audience, but the magic thing is that it stops just short of undermining the scares. When this film stands to attention, it has moments of pure terror.Friday 11 February, 9pm, Talking Pictures TV A new Jean-Pierre Jeunet film deserves to be celebrated in the streets. His last film, The Young and Prodigious TS Spivet, came out almost a decade ago; Micmacs, his most recent film in his native French, came out back in the noughties. Jeunet’s long-awaited comeback vehicle, released through Netflix, is Bigbug. A film set in the future, it is perhaps best to describe Bigbug as Tim Burton doing The Terminator. The Yonyx, a breed of AI designed to help humanity, goes rogue and declares mankind to be superfluous.

2/4/2022,"If you’re not a Tory, the past few months may have brought some pleasure after years of torment. Bad news for the Conservatives has suddenly started coming almost daily: misfiring smear campaigns, chaotic U-turns, potentially lethal investigations, Tory MPs and rightwing papers turning on Boris Johnson, panicky ministers struggling through interviews, leadership rivalries ruining policy announcements, and a sustained plunge in the opinion polls. The multiplying consequences of the Downing Street party scandals have changed the political atmosphere. The importance of all this should not be underestimated. A terrible government, the most lethally incompetent and probably the most corrupt in modern British history, may finally be beginning to be held to account. At the same time, Conservatism’s image – as a rarely nice but often realistic ruling ideology – is being badly damaged. Seemingly unknown to themselves, Johnson and his remaining loyalists are becoming a laughing stock.  But are we laughing too much? Conservative governments in the past have regularly suffered humiliating meltdowns. In 1990 Margaret Thatcher’s premiership ended in tears after months of plotting against her. In 1995 her successor, John Major, resigned as leader and sought re-election in a failed attempt to silence his critics. More recently, the crises have come faster and faster: David Cameron’s resignation after losing his Brexit referendum in 2016; Theresa May’s disastrous attempt to increase her parliamentary majority in 2017; the failed effort to remove her through a no-confidence vote in 2018; her repeated Brexit defeats and resignation in 2019. None of these episodes led to the Conservatives losing office. On each occasion, for days or weeks or months, the party’s future appeared to hang in the balance. Journalists reported excitedly from Downing Street, or outside meetings of the Tories’ much-mythologised 1922 Committee. Opposition parties seized on Conservative divisions and disarray. Labour politicians began to believe they might soon take office. And then, every time, the sense of crisis gradually ebbed away. The Conservatives changed their leader, or some of their policies, or just played for time, exploiting the many opportunities in Britain’s parliamentary calendar for evasion and delay. With its frequent recesses – the latest begins next Friday – the House of Commons is not as tough a place for wounded prime ministers as is traditionally claimed. Something less tangible also helps Tory governments survive these disastrous phases: voters often lose interest. Not just because most people only follow politics closely for, at best, a few days at a time – an attention span that digital media is probably shortening with its overload of political opinions and information. But also because these crises can be emotionally and politically satisfying in themselves. By exposing the errors and shortcomings of our usual ruling class, and by forcing them into U-turns, changes of leadership and displays of sometimes embarrassing contrition, Conservative crises can feel like a rebalancing between politicians and citizens – and make more fundamental change seem unnecessary. The 1992 and 2019 elections both came after particularly protracted periods of Tory upheaval. Yet they saw the biggest total Conservative votes of the past half-century. Many people seemed to feel that the Tories had listened and adapted sufficiently to their discontents. The government had been punished enough, so a new one was not needed. In pre-democratic times, the status quo was protected by brief, pressure-releasing ruptures in the established order. In the annual Feast of Fools in medieval France, for example, low-ranking clergy temporarily swapped places with their superiors and mockery of church practices was permitted. There is also something similarly ritualised about today’s Tory crises: from the theatrical sending of letters to the 1922 Committee by MPs seeking a leadership contest, to the inauthentic-feeling attacks on the government by the rightwing press, which flare up and then suddenly cease. These protagonists may well be playing their roles on the understanding that uncomfortable periods for the Tories are the necessary price, paid every few years, for the party’s longterm dominance. And during these crises British politics becomes, more than ever, mostly about the Conservatives. Currently that means the culture Johnson has created in Downing Street; what Sue Gray and Scotland Yard make of it; and who might replace Johnson as premier. For non-Tories, trying to work out who would be the least awful new Tory leader is a familiar routine – in effect, a partial acceptance of continuing Conservative rule. Many voters and journalists probably know more about the rules of Tory leadership contests than they do about Keir Starmer’s policies. And that’s not just because he doesn’t yet have enough compelling ones. There is an English preoccupation with Tory politics that is a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy. In one-party states, it’s common to ridicule or feel contempt for your government without being able to envisage its removal. Our politics isn’t that stuck, yet, despite the Tories’ ongoing efforts to tilt the electoral system in their favour, such as making it harder to vote for social groups who tend not to support them. But the deepening cynicism about politicians means that a chaotic government no longer shocks and alienates voters as much as it did in previous eras with struggling prime ministers, such as the 1970s, when Edward Heath and Jim Callaghan were ejected from Downing Street for smaller errors than Johnson’s. Nowadays it’s widely expected that our leaders will be out of their depth, as well as entirely out for themselves. That’s one reason why Starmer’s offer of more competence and integrity has yet to properly resonate. Not enough voters can envisage such a government. Yet it’s too early to be sure that the Tories’ current troubles will recede in the usual way. There is another, rarer kind of Conservative crisis. It is less exciting to follow, but longer-lasting and more lethal. It involves enough voters firmly deciding that the Tories have been in power for too long, and then fitting every government scandal and mistake into that template. The last time this happened was in the 1990s, when Labour’s return to office was preceded by almost five years of Tory calamities and failed relaunches. Tony Blair was Labour leader for the most decisive part of the period, and his ability to promise a better future helped make the Conservative government look obsolete. Starmer doesn’t have the same salesman’s gifts. Nor, unlike Blair, does he get much of a hearing from wavering Tory voters and the rightwing press. We live in a more tribal age. It’s also a more impatient one, when the political mood quickly changes. The next general election may not be for almost three more years. The Tories could be in the early stages of a terminal crisis. But if you’re hoping that they really are doomed this time, it’s going to be an anxious wait.

2/4/2022,"Almost five years after the fatal stabbing of his cousin and Pivot Gang collaborator John Walt in 2017, Chicago rapper Saba – real name Tahj Malik Chandler – is still grieving. In 2018, he responded to the tragedy with the album Care for Me: a complex, melancholic paean, hot with denial, sometimes sunk under by depression. Few Good Things sees Saba resurface, moving beyond the acceptance stage on an album that sounds and feels like one long exhale.  The “Few” in the title doesn’t point out a lack of something, but an appreciation for those things – home, family (Saba’s appears in recorded snippets throughout), happiness – that he does have, and he paints this, on 2012, in shades of youthful innocence: snips of birdsong, rolling snares, and a blissed-out chorus of “I had everything I needed, everything” – all tales of bunking school in pursuit of friendship and first loves. The title track is a highlight, and ties knotty emotions into a neat bow: “Glass half full, the other half was the emptiness / We turned a bunch of nothing to abundance.” Sometimes, his long, healing exhale gets caught in the throat. On Survivor’s Guilt, Saba mean-mugs in the mould of Kendrick Lamar’s more pent-up moments; A Simpler Time is less potent, and sees him tangled in off-kilter percussion (he can be guilty of the “word salad” he raps about).

2/4/2022,"Major League Rugby will kick-off its fifth season this weekend with the addition of a 13th team, the Dallas Jackals, who postponed entry last year due to the Covid pandemic.  Covid cut short the 2020 US season too but MLR came back to go “99 & 0” in 2021, completing every fixture. In the championship game, the LA Giltinis – one of two teams, with the Austin Gilgronis, still named for a cocktail named for their owner – beat Rugby ATL, from Atlanta, for the shield. This year’s promotional theme is “Rise of Rugby”, based on the growth of a competition which started with seven teams in 2018 and rugby union’s long-hoped for rise to a place in the US mainstream. USA Rugby, the national union, is bidding to host a men’s World Cup. MLR is thinking big too. Sources say St Louis and Chicago will add 14th and 15th teams next year. For now, the arrival of Dallas means seven teams in the western conference and six in the east. The competition will run until the end of June and there will be 16 regular-season games each, followed by playoffs. Games will be shown nationally on Fox, on regional platforms and around the world on therugbynetwork.com. “As we approach our half-decade mark with MLR, I have seen firsthand that there is a global rugby movement within the United States and Canada,” the league commissioner, former Dallas Mavericks executive George Killebrew, said in a statement. “Thanks to the groundswell of support for the ‘Rise of Rugby’, our league is truly gaining momentum on the national stage. I cannot wait to introduce Major League Rugby to more fans and see continued growth in attendance numbers, broadcast ratings and global recognition during our fifth season. There’s a place for everyone in our sport.” There are fewer big global names in MLR this year, though the former England flanker and captain Chris Robshaw will hope for an injury-free second season with the San Diego Legion and Matt Giteau, one of the greatest Australian backs of all time and all of 39 years old, will play one more year in LA. Intriguingly, Dallas have picked up two backs with vast English Premiership experience: Henry Trinder, once of Gloucester, and Chris Pennell, long of Worcester. There is still a sense of a league in flux and formation. Rugby ATL, for example, roared to the championship game in their first full season but have hit choppier waters. The Rattlers have seen the death of their majority owner, Marcus Calloway; a takeover by Global Rugby Ventures, a company tied to Errik Anderson of the New England Free Jacks and with Adam Gilchrist of LA and Austin one of two powerful owners on either coast; and the departure of a widely respected head coach, Scott Lawrence. The takeover and the departure, sources said, were not unconnected. New York have been particularly visible to European eyes, thanks in part to signings like Ben Foden and Matthieu Bastareaud. But their search for a permanent home continues. In 2019, as Rugby United New York, they played at MCU Park, a baseball stadium in Coney Island, Brooklyn. They have been to St John’s University in Queens but Cochrane Stadium in Jersey City hosted most games last season and this year New York will play in another small Jersey stadium, JFK in Hoboken. They have also dropped the “United”. On the other coast, the Giltinis still play at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, a huge venue for small rugby crowds but which certainly looks good on TV. Down the coast, Torero Stadium in San Diego hosted the first two championship games but is no longer home to the Legion. Nomadic last year, this year they will play on the SDSU Sports Deck: a field on the roof of a parking garage. Next year, the Legion will have a more spectacular home: Snapdragon Stadium, a venue being built for San Diego State University. The 35,000-capacity venue, the Legion said on Thursday, “was specifically designed to accommodate the rugged and exciting sport of rugby, whose expansion is inevitable”. Bold words, in keeping with the league’s bullish outlook. Also in keeping with all things bullish is the presence of crossover athletes from mainstream US sports. The England and Lions prop turned NBC host Alex Corbisiero is fronting one attempt to find such players, a web series called Cross the Line. Another operation continues in Glendale, Colorado. The small city near Denver was home to an MLR team until an 2020. It is now where the American Raptors are trying to shape football players, basketball players and wrestlers into pro rugby talent, all the while filming for a series, Rugby Town, shown in the UK on BT Sport. By email, Patrick Guthrie, producer of the series, said: “David Still is our first Eagle in sevens, and since the end of the second season, 13 American Raptors players have signed, or have been offered and declined to sign, MLR contracts.” Among those with deals is Tani Tupou, once a defensive end for the University of Washington, Seattle Seahawks, Atlanta Falcons and Arizona Cardinals, now a 6ft 2in, 275lbs prop for the Seattle Seawolves, MLR champions in seasons one and two, now looking for a resurgence. Pono Davis, a big Hawaiian, is with the Houston SaberCats. Once a defensive tackle for Southern Methodist University in Dallas, he is the same height as Tupou but 20lbs heavier. He is also now a prop. The SaberCats promise an interesting season. Founder members with a purpose-built stadium, a rare and precious thing, they have struggled to make a mark on the field. For season five, like most teams, they have signed talent from South Africa, the islands and other rugby hotspots. But they have also picked up two American sevens Olympians who should show strongly: Danny Barrett, a particularly bruising back rower, and Matai Leuta, a big wing or centre.",Sport/Sport,Major League Rugby: US competition set to kick-off season five,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/04/major-league-rugby-us-season-five-preview
2/4/2022,"“Pram Boy, pill-boy, you know who… it is you who will be carried / while the others are shed.” Violets begins with a miscarriage and a conception in the final months of the second world war. Violet Hall, a newly married suburban wife who is doing war work in a Birmingham munitions factory, loses blood and the foetuses of two babies into a pail and has her womb removed by callously zealous doctors. At the same time, in small-town Wales, unmarried Violet Owen conceives a child with her mother’s lodger, a Polish soldier. The book weaves between the two Violets, threaded throughout with insistently spirited, half-comical poetic interjections addressing Pram Boy, the baby who will bind these women’s lives together.  At first the two Violets are difficult to disentangle. Both are working class, both live in the shadows of more charismatic family members, both yearn vaguely for more expansive lives. Then we see Violet Owen make the most decisive step of her life. A few months pregnant, she signs on for war work and asks to be shipped abroad. Her time in Naples, vividly evoked with deft details rather than set-piece scenes, changes her but does not hold out the promise of a new life. This is partly because the letters she writes home to her family are flattened versions of her experiences that wilfully leave out the vivid sights she has seen: “No port, no cove, no filth, no decay. No light. No shade.” At the end of the war, she gives birth in a military hospital and is shipped back to England where, after eight months, she gives her baby up for adoption and Violet Hall’s turn for motherhood has come. The women are not analytically reflective, and the novel skates on the surface of half-experienced thoughts and feelings, with both Violets alive to the more luridly burnished sensibilities of others. “We have taken the cot but the playpen is still there,” a doctor informs Violet Hall after her hysterectomy, indicating that sex is still on the cards. On the ship to Naples, Violet Owen falls half in love with an upper-class woman called Maggie, who comes across as both grotesque and enviable in the immediacy of her wants and her expectation of their satisfaction. “What kind of person expects the world to yield that way, to sway with every bend of her wiry limbs?” Violet asks herself as Maggie leads her around the ship. The most striking feature of the book is the poetry addressing the baby. There’s a tense playfulness to the writing here, alongside the lyrical rapture, and it makes the baby almost as characterised a presence as his two mothers. We are aware of the stages of his gestation – “your ears are shells of tiny, soft-cell bones, / your heart a bivalve” – and then of his readying himself to be born: “Tonight, Pram Boy / you are a caged bird / fluttering between.” Eventually the “uterine-clencher. / Heart-wrencher” emerges into the world, “limb-free and lung-kicked”, and the poet addressing him revels in his energetic sucking: “Press / your face, fill / your mouth / with her flesh.” Violet Owen finds that she and her child are “sea creatures in the deep” as her milk engulfs them both. Motherhood here is a bodily experience for one Violet and disorientingly disembodied for the other. Alex Hyde works as a lecturer in gender studies, and some of the troubled ambivalences of feminism are at the book’s heart. How can we as feminists honour miscarriage as the loss of a child, while also insisting that an aborted foetus is not actually a child? How can we both insist on the right of a single, impoverished woman such as Violet to be a mother while also insisting on her right not to mother the eight-month-old baby she gives up? There’s a kind of tender grace in Hyde’s writing – in its attentiveness to moment-by-moment bodily experience – that allows her to create a novelistic world open to all these questions and possibilities, without making any of it explicitly political. Both women are changed by pregnancy, and Violet Owen is changed more radically by the experience of being claimed by a creature whose bodily needs take over hers. Released from a home for new mothers for a trip home to Wales, she keeps her baby a secret, and it’s almost as though her life remains unchanged since she was last there. But her motherhood asserts itself in the milk that spills painfully from her breasts, surreptitiously expressed into a glass in the night. The arbitrariness of birth and of blood ties is set hard up against the visceral inevitability of the mother-baby bond. One Violet happens to be married, the other isn’t; both are fitted to be mothers yet both are also aware of a world beyond motherhood and its restrictions, which is felt enticingly over the horizon. The relationship between motherhood and biology is possibly more fraught as an issue now than it was in the second world war. Hyde has found a way to make the past speak presciently to our times while also maintaining a playful relationship to a story that becomes unexpectedly moving, warm-hearted despite its flinty poetic prose.

2/4/2022,"Over the past two years, the NFL’s old guard has cycled out, making way for a new generation of stars. Future hall of famers Ben Roethlisberger, Drew Brees and Tom Brady have left the building. Aaron Rodgers continues to tease that he may follow the trio out of the door.  In their place is a new crop of quarterbacks. Adding to the intrigue: the talent is concentrated in one conference. Draw up any top-eight quarterback list, and the names Josh Allen, Patrick Mahomes, Justin Herbert, Joe Burrow, and Lamar Jackson will appear in some order. And who knows, there’s a chance that one of Trevor Lawrence, Mac Jones and Zach Wilson will join the party over the next couple of years. After back-to-back playoff battles, the Allen-Mahomes rivalry has slotted neatly into the void left by the near-annual Brady-Manning matchup. Adding Burrow, Herbert, and Jackson to the mix is just unfair. The AFC is swamped with the game’s best and brightest. The next 10 years are set to produce some of the finest quarterback duels the playoffs have ever seen, featuring a rotating cast of five rather than the league’s most fearsome twosome. There is no wrong answer here. You can take Rodgers or Brady. If you want to doff the hipster cap, maybe look to Cooper Kupp for his third-down impact on a Rams offense that was otherwise up-and-down for the bulk of the year. Still: It’s an award about value, and the quarterback is indisputably the most valuable player on the field. Rodgers edges Brady out in the most compelling advanced metrics. The EPA+CPOE Composite, which tracks the down-to-down value of each play and attempts to isolate the quarterback’s impact on those plays (using the Completion Over Expectation metric thanks to the tracking chips in the player’s shoulder pads), has Rodgers streaking ahead of the field. This season Rodgers has lacked some of the awe-inspiring, how-does-he-do-that performances that have come to define his career, but he traded that in for a touch of Brady’s nagging excellence. Rodgers piloted the most effective, efficient, and explosive offense in the league, leading his team to 13 wins in 16 starts. That should be enough to swipe the award. Aaron Donald is the best defensive player in the NFL. Myles Garrett had the best individual season of any defensive player in 2021. TJ Watt tied the NFL sack record. But let’s think of the DPOTY award not as a Who Had The Most Sacks award as it traditionally defaults to but “which player had the biggest total impact on the unit.” Let’s think of it as a true defensive MVP. With that mindset, there’s not much competition: It’s Parsons, the Dallas Cowboys’ outstanding linebacker. Forget evolution, Parsons triggered a defensive revolution in Dallas. Sure, there is all sorts of talent on all branches of the Cowboys’ defensive tree, but it’s Parsons’ versatility that makes the thing sing. He can align here, there and everywhere. On one snap, he’s a sideline-to-sideline thumper. The next, he’s sliding into deep coverage. The next, he’s turning the corner as a pass-rusher, drawing comparisons to the best to ever do it. It’s too easy for Micah Parsons ⭐️pic.twitter.com/UMYDy7cbQy Parsons became one of the league’s most dominant defenders, and this after opting out of his final year of college. And he did it not as a one-trick pony, but as the ultimate Swiss Army Knife. That’s not rare, it is totally without precedent. Samuel’s success has been less about his gaudy, record-breaking numbers and more about how his style has shattered norms. When you’ve spent half a season redefining the very concept of positions, you know you’ve achieved something pretty special. The hybrid running back-receiver’s ability to add splash plays alongside his team’s formidable defense carried the 49ers to within a possession of the Super Bowl (had Kyle Shanahan better managed the clock, they might be playing next Sunday). Now prepare for an offseason of teams dipping into the draft or free agency trying to find a Samuel clone. But Samuel is one of a kind. Any team looking to recreate his success by targeting a hybrid player in the draft will be disappointed. The tidal wave of opinion that the Titans were the worst No 1 seed in history proved to be true. The Titans were not a great team, but that should not discredit what Vrabel was able to pull off this season. Vrabel’s gruff exterior and rah-rah persona belie one of the game’s most creative thinkers. He’s more of a chess player, a scheme manipulator than he’s given credit for. All that stuff that Brandon Staley is running in Los Angeles that makes the X’s and O’s nerds go gaga, Vrabel was running way back in his days as the defensive coordinator in Houston. He has long been ahead of the league’s trends, even if they’re often hidden behind a Derrick Henry-shaped exterior. Throughout the season, Vrabel found solutions that allowed him to hide Ryan Tannehill’s flaws, even with Henry out of the line-up. He helped construct a feisty defense that was the driving force behind Tennessee winning 12 games. He gets all the little things right on the margins, which is how a team that has no business winning double-digit games winds up winning 12 and claiming the division crown. Often coach of the year goes to someone who outperforms preseason expectations. The Titans were expected to make the playoffs, but Vrabel deserves the award for keeping a creaky ship on course. Anarumo’s season will most likely be remembered for his second-half masterplan against Mahomes and the Chiefs offense in the AFC title game. But throughout the season Anarumo has been the architect of one of the league’s overachieving groups. The Bengals defense has talent sprinkled through every level, but it isn’t exactly blessed with a bevy of All-Pros. It’s a case of good players playing excellently as a collective. Anarumo has come into his own this season. Over the span of his career, he has been the architect of the same Bad (with a capital B) defenses. He has been rigid in his thinking, sticking to the old ways in the belief they are the way. This season, he’s shifted. His defense moves more than ever. Every week, the Bengals unveil a fresh take on their old packages. Some coaches get stuck in their ways, their egos telling them they’ve cracked this football thing. Good coaches are constantly looking to adapt, to build their scheme around their best players, and to keep up with the evolutionary cycle of the league. Anarumo was once a dogmatist. This season, he’s ditched dogma in favor of what has worked, and he’s led his defense all the way to the Super Bowl. You can go any number of ways here. Was Stafford the best player acquired over the last 12 months? No. Has he had the greatest impact? No. Matthew Judon in New England and Melvin Ingram have stronger claims under those criteria. But Stafford was acquired for a specific reason: To raise the floor of the Rams offense; to make one or two throws that could push the team back to the Super Bowl, the kind of throws Jared Goff was unable, or unwilling, to make. Stafford to Kupp again!The #Rams get down to the #Buccaneers’ 12-yard line.The 44-yard completion increases LA’s win probability by 37% and sets up a game-winning field goal attempt.#LARvsTB #RamsHouse pic.twitter.com/02BYoIQXXl Stafford hasn’t hit his loftiest heights this season. His flaws have been magnified on a team that has, at times, needed him to put the offense on his back. But he was brought to LA with the specific purpose of hitting a big-time throw (or two) in a big-time game. His 44-yard pass to Cooper Kupp in the divisional round against Tampa Bay to set up the winning field goal and effectively end Tom Brady’s career was that moment. Mission accomplished.

2/4/2022,"Great Britain’s energy regulator could update the energy price cap as often as every three months as it braces for further volatility across global markets. Jonathan Brearley, Ofgem’s chief executive, said it would be better to have the option to update the price cap more frequently to allow households to “adjust much more quickly” to some of the changes in the market. Currently, the price cap is reviewed every six months.  Ofgem raised the cap on average household energy bills by 54% to £1,971 on Thursday, the biggest increase since it introduced the cap in 2019. The increase will take effect from April, following the last increase six months before in October. Soaring household energy bills reflect an extraordinary period on wholesale gas markets, with the cost paid by suppliers quadrupling in the space of a few months amid increased demand during the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. The oil and gas producer Shell on Thursday announced its highest quarterly profit in eight years. The increase will hit household budgets at a time when overall consumer price index inflation has risen to a 30-year high, with prices reflecting shortages caused by the coronavirus pandemic. “What we’re now saying is that we need to look to the future, and the difficult news for all of us is that this volatile market might be with us for some time,” Brearley told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “To do that we’ve got to change our entire regulatory package to make sure the market can better adapt.” He acknowledged that more frequent updates would have meant prices rose more quickly this winter but said equally that customers would see the benefits of price drops more quickly as well. The move is likely to help suppliers by allowing them to raise prices more quickly, after the collapse of 29 energy companies, most of whom had not protected themselves sufficiently against wholesale cost increases. The regulator and the government have faced criticism for not introducing measures to prevent the crisis. About 10% of the rise in bills – about £68 a household – went towards paying for the costs of emergency measures to continue providing gas to customers whose supplier collapsed. A document outlining the change said that it would give the regulator more flexibility to cope with exceptional circumstances. Brearley said suppliers “need to be much more financially resilient” but claimed that the best way to avoid a repeat of this winter’s crisis would be to push faster towards increased energy efficiency, renewable energy and nuclear energy. “Looking into the long term, the real way for the country to get out of the volatility we’ve seen is to diversify our energy sources and push harder on getting towards our net zero target,” Brearley said.",News/Business,"Energy price cap may be updated every three months, says Ofgem",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/04/energy-price-cap-may-be-updated-every-three-months-ofgem
2/4/2022,"The Morrison government has signalled it will take the first steps towards implementing recommendations from the Jenkins review into parliamentary culture when parliament resumes next week, one of the final sessions before the federal election. The finance minister, Simon Birmingham, indicated last year he would aim to implement the first two recommendations of the landmark review before parliament resumed in February, and amend legislation governing the employment of political staff before the election.  In an interview with Guardian Australia late last year, Birmingham said his immediate priorities were setting up a leadership taskforce to oversee the changes, and preparing a public statement acknowledging the trauma caused by bullying, sexual harassment and sexual assault in political offices ready to deliver after the summer break. The Morrison government remains under public pressure to improve the safety of parliamentary workplaces. In a statement on Friday, Birmingham said a multiparty leadership taskforce had been established to oversee the implementation of the recommendations and had met for the first time on Thursday. He said the taskforce had discussed making a statement of acknowledgment, which was the first recommendation of the Jenkins review, as well as the establishment of a parliamentary committee to report on the development of codes of conduct for commonwealth parliamentary workplaces. Birmingham also confirmed the government would introduce legislative changes recommended by the Jenkins review. The changes would confirm that the Fair Work Act 2009, the Age Discrimination Act 2004 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 apply to people employed under the Members of Parliament Staff Act (MOP(S) Act). The change would also confirm the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 applied to parliamentarians in their capacity as employers. Last November, Australia’s sex discrimination commissioner, Kate Jenkins, recommended a significant overhaul of federal parliament’s toxic workplace culture after handing down her report that found one in three staffers interviewed had been sexually harassed. The Jenkins inquiry was triggered after former Liberal staffer Brittany Higgins alleged she was raped after hours in a ministerial office in March 2019. Higgins’s allegations are the subject of separate criminal proceedings. Next week, Higgins will appear at the National Press Club in Canberra with former Australian of the Year and survivor advocate Grace Tame. Former parliamentary staffers have urged the Morrison government and other political parties to quickly implement the recommendations, warning failure to do so will trigger a fierce backlash from women at the ballot box. The Jenkins review made 28 recommendations, and last year’s mid-year economic and fiscal outlook (Myefo) allocated $17.8m over four years to fund their implementation. Jenkins recommended political leaders make a public statement acknowledging “the impact of the misconduct on individuals and the lack of action taken in the past” and “outline the institutional leadership commitment to change, with shared accountability for progress”. Jenkins’s second recommendation was the government establish a leadership taskforce, with oversight by the presiding officers, “chaired by an independent expert and supported by an implementation group” to ensure all the recommendations of the report were implemented. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The sex discrimination commissioner also recommended a comprehensive review of the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act, and legislative changes ensuring there were fair termination processes for employees. Chelsey Potter, a former Liberal party adviser, told Guardian Australia on Friday the government’s failure to grapple seriously with the issues last year had “set the bar so low at this stage that any minor progress feels like one giant step forward for the Morrison government”. Potter has alleged she was sexually assaulted by another colleague in Canberra while working for Birmingham in 2015. She was a key advocate ahead of the Jenkins inquiry to ensure the review maintained a workable balance between confidentiality for submitters, and the preservation of staff rights to access key records held by their former employers. On Friday, she said the government had not been very open with former staff about its intentions since the release of the Jenkins review. “I sincerely hope that, finally, we can see tangible action and progress – almost a year after Brittany first shared her story”. Jenkins on Friday welcomed the initial progress. “I welcome minister Birmingham’s announcement of a multiparty leadership taskforce to oversee the implementation of all 28 recommendations from our #SetTheStandard report”. “The multiparty support for the Set the Standard review was an important pillar, and I welcome the continued involvement of the opposition, minor parties and independents,” she said.",News/Australia news,Government poised to act on findings of landmark Jenkins review,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/04/government-poised-to-act-on-findings-of-landmark-jenkins-review
