Everton are ready to pay Van de Beek’s full salary until the end of the season after he was identified by Lampard – who is expected to be confirmed as the club’s manager on Sunday – as a priority target. The Netherlands international, who has had limited game time at United under Ole Gunnar Solskjær and Ralf Rangnick, is also wanted by Patrick Vieira at Palace, who began their pursuit some days earlier. A new midfielder is vital for Everton before Monday night’s transfer deadline with Abdoulaye Doucouré, Tom Davies and Fabian Delph sidelined until March with injury.

1/30/2022,"There is one man with very personal reasons for finding the scenes of sectarian intimidation in Sir Kenneth Branagh’s film homage to his home city particularly haunting – his first cousin, Martin Hamilton. Hamilton, who grew up with Branagh and his family in inner-city north Belfast, says the images of Catholic families being forced out of the mainly Protestant district brought back painful memories of his own fractured friendships that were lost in the Troubles.  Branagh’s movie Belfast – hotly tipped for an Oscar – is a memoirish tale of how the Northern Ireland conflict that erupted in 1969 forced his family to escape the gathering sectarian storm. Watching the darker moments of Belfast when Catholics are driven from their homes, Hamilton recalled how a fiercely close boyhood friendship was broken up. “Those parts of the film really resonated with me when I first saw Ken’s film,” he said. “I was living across from Ken and his family, in flats on Skegoneil Avenue in 1969. My best friend growing up was a lad from a Catholic family. We played football together, we got into fights together – although never about religion – and we made up frequently after them. We were inseparable as boys. “When the Troubles broke out, people from outside our area, some of whom were Protestants moving out of mainly Catholic districts, started to stir things up in the flats. “They started asking why Catholics were still living among us and the atmosphere they created was so hostile that these Catholic families, including my friend’s, felt too insecure to stay. “They moved out just like the people forced from their homes by the mob in Ken’s film. Ken captured this tragic turn of events so well in the movie. It was so very true to what was sadly happening back then,” he said. Hamilton, who will be 70 this year, described Branagh and his older brother Bill as “more like my other brothers rather than cousins”. He said: “Because my dad was working in the shipyard and my mum managed a local Co-op store, I used to go to my aunt Frances and uncle Billy’s house after school. I knocked around more with his brother Bill as we were about the same age. I remember Ken at the time was quiet, shy.” As in the movie, Branagh and his family leave strife-torn Belfast for a new life in England. But when Branagh returned to his native city in the late 1970s to star in a series of critically acclaimed TV dramas written by Graham Reid – the Billy plays – his extended family were there to protect him. Hamilton told the Observer he was deployed to ensure his actor-cousin with the English accent wouldn’t be mistaken for a British soldier. “Ken stayed with my mum and dad as Aunt Frances was worried about him. She was concerned that with his accent someone might think he was a soldier, which was a very dangerous thing to be in Belfast in the 1970s. “I was tasked with driving him over from the north of the city to the filming in the east. Many years later when he became famous, he spoke about those wet and windy nights in Belfast when his cousin drove him about. He never ever forgot about his roots or his family.” Branagh’s film recreates the working-class Victorian terraced streets and alleyways of the Mountcollyer Street/York Road area at the end of the 1960s. Today the district is depopulated, with row upon row of bricked up houses, while Mountcollyer Street where the Branagh clan lived is hardly a street at all any more, but rather a cul de sac. Those who grew up nearby in the Tigers Bay area, such as Karen Clarkin, said the set of Belfast with its corner shops, street lamps and yards with outside toilets is faithful to the time and place that Branagh’s direction captures. “My granny was friends with Ken’s grandmother Frances who lived across from her. His granny was always talking about her grandson who she insisted was always going to be a great actor. “But it was the scenes in the film of his grandfather (played by fellow Northern Ireland actor Ciarán Hinds) that really got to me. Him sitting on the outside toilet drinking his mug of tea, all his tools and his knick-knacks reminded me of my own grandad in Tigers Bay. I loved the film because it brought home what this part of Belfast really was like,” Clarkin said. Then she pointed to a nearby structure in a green space Branagh would once have played in during the late 1960s – Alexandra Park. During the Troubles the park was often a nightly battleground for rival rioting Protestant and Catholic youths. The violence became so bad that locals living on either side of what was once an invisible sectarian dividing line demanded a permanent barrier to keep the mobs apart. A giant steel “peace” structure was built, and its foundations were laid on 1 September 1994, the first day of the historic IRA ceasefire. Although it can be opened during the day, this 3-metre reinforced corrugated iron barrier remains a near-permanent “border” creating separate Protestant and Catholic zones in the park. While the film contains joyous moments and is a love letter to a city Branagh clearly adores, Belfast ends with captions that commemorate the things lost during 35 years of conflict. The director remembers those who had to leave, those who remained and endured, and finally those that were lost for ever in the violence. The film has struck a chord with the generations who lived through the Troubles. After a screening at the art deco Strand cinema in east Belfast last Tuesday several elderly and middle-aged viewers had tears in their eyes as they left the movie house. That sentiment of loss and futility is felt too by Hamilton, who has watched his famous cousin’s award-winning movie twice. “I can still remember the name of every family in our flats that had to get out. They had good neighbours, but it was the bad ones that forced them to go. I suppose if Ken’s film has any message for me personally it is that Northern Ireland can be a great place if they’d just leave us alone.”",Arts/Culture,‘I grew up with Branagh in Belfast: our childhoods haunt his new film’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/30/belfast-ken-branaghs-love-letter-to-torn-city-that-taught-him-so-much
1/30/2022,"Until last week, Spotify-using fans of Neil Young could access a vast 54-year catalogue of songs, which attracted more than 6 million listeners a month. Now all that remains are appearances on compilations and, for some reason, a 1989 live album. Enraged by what he saw as the promotion of “life-threatening Covid misinformation” on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, the Canadian singer-songwriter issued an ultimatum: “They can have Rogan or Young. Not both.” As Young surely knew, Spotify’s choice was a foregone conclusion. Rogan’s show, which the streaming service acquired for $100m in 2020, is its most popular podcast, with an average listenership of 11 million per episode. In its first month, it accounted for 4.5% of all podcast listening on Spotify worldwide. For Spotify, which is banking on podcasts to drive subscriptions, he is a star of the magnitude of Adele.  He has also become explosively controversial. Young’s walkout, followed later in the week by Joni Mitchell’s exit in solidarity, was prompted by an open letter calling on Spotify to counter Covid misinformation after Rogan recorded an interview with Dr Robert Malone, a virologist who has become a rightwing media star for his opposition to vaccines. The director general of the WHO tweeted in support of Young’s boycott: “We all have a role to play to end this pandemic and infodemic.” Young, the most ornery of all boomer rock legends, is the perfect antagonist. He is an obsessive audiophile who temporarily removed his music from all streaming services in 2015 and a purist whose 1988 single This Note’s for You decried licensing songs to commercials. As a survivor of childhood polio, he might also have particularly strong opinions about vaccines. What’s more, he can afford to take the considerable financial hit. He has a loyal fanbase that will pay for top-dollar boxsets and subscriptions to his website archive. Last year, he sold 50% of the rights to his song catalogue to the investment fund Hipgnosis for a reported $150m. For less comfortable artists, Spotify could be too big to quit. In the opposite corner is Rogan, a former comedian and martial artist who has recorded close to 1,800 episodes since launching his podcast in 2009. His guests have included Kanye West, Elon Musk, Quentin Tarantino and Bernie Sanders. But he has also entertained figures from the “alt-right” such as the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, the Proud Boys co-founder Gavin McInnes and the provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos. Rogan’s politics are broadly contrarian with a rightward skew. He is a bullish libertarian who initially backed Sanders in the 2020 election but ended up preferring Donald Trump to Joe Biden. Last April, Rogan said that if you are young, fit and healthy, then you do not need a vaccine, attracting criticism from Biden’s chief medical advisor, Anthony Fauci. “I’m not an anti-vax person,” Rogan responded. “I believe they’re safe and encourage many people to take them.” Yet he has still booked anti-vaccine guests. Unlike Facebook or Twitter, Spotify has never claimed to have an ideological commitment to free speech. In 2017, following a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, it began removing music by “hate bands”. The following year, it introduced a somewhat incoherent “hate and hateful conduct” policy, designed to promote “openness, diversity, tolerance and respect”. Spotify may be deeply inconsistent but it has established a precedent that it takes responsibility for the material it serves up. Last week, a spokesperson boasted that Spotify had “removed over 20,000 podcast episodes related to Covid since the start of the pandemic”, a startling number. Not Rogan’s though. Spotify CEO, Daniel Ek, has framed his hands-off approach as an anti-censorship issue, telling US news website Axios last year that Rogan was no different to a big-name rapper: “And we don’t dictate what they’re putting in their songs either.” Musicians have had an ambivalent relationship with Spotify since its US launch in 2011. Some are grateful to it for saving the music industry after a decade of digital piracy and plummeting sales while others claim its measly royalty rates favour only the megastar elite. The pandemic has re-energised its critics. Abruptly deprived of concert income, many artists looked again at their royalty statements and demanded a fairer deal. The Young-Rogan contretemps is a PR headache of a different order, one that exposes the tensions inherent in Spotify’s aggressive move into podcasting and decision to make music a subset of audio. Now artists and subscribers are effectively funding politically inflammatory content in the middle of a global health crisis. The rappers mentioned by Ek haven’t embraced Covid misinformation and would not reach 11 million listeners if they did. For a company proud of its progressive record, doubling down on Rogan on the pretext of a sudden dedication to free speech appears disingenuous, cynical and greedy. While still the largest streaming service by far, Spotify has been slowly losing market share to its rivals. Podcasts were meant to reverse that slide but they could make things worse by thrusting Spotify on to the culture-war frontline. While the company has presumably calculated that the financial benefit of sticking with Rogan outweighs the reputational cost, many users have cancelled their premium subscriptions. “The company’s bullshit is just too much to bear now,” tweeted the popular YouTube music critic Anthony Fantano. The backlash is calling into question what exactly Spotify has become, or was all along. The US musician Damon Krukowski tweeted that Spotify “are not in the music business, they are a tech platform, and however they can get people to spend more time on the platform, that’s where they will go… Spotify is not interested in the future of music.” Not for the first time in his maverick career, Neil Young has opened a can of worms. This one might be the biggest of them all.  Dorian Lynskey is the author of The Ministry of Truth: A Biography of George Orwell’s 1984",Opinion/Opinion,Podcasts were meant to revive Spotify.

1/30/2022,"How deeply strange it is, how deeply unsettling, to be able to compare and contrast a fictional pandemic with the real thing. I read Emily St John Mandel’s bestselling Station Eleven shortly after it came out in 2014, when the tale of a mysterious flu sweeping the globe and laying waste to normal life lay wholly beyond the bounds of reality. Now the television adaptation by Patrick Somerville (known for Maniac and The Leftovers) for HBO, streaming in the UK on Starzplay, is here and … resonating. Or at least part of it is. There are – as is starting to feel mandatory with small-screen dramas – two timelines. The first concerns the early days and years of the pandemic. Different episodes concentrate on the experiences of different characters, but the through line is young Kirsten (an absolutely extraordinary performance from 13-year-old Matilda Lawler in her first substantial role), a child actor who is abandoned by her chaperone when a stage performance of King Lear is chaotically truncated by the death of the lead, Arthur (Gael García Bernal).  Audience member Jeevan (Himesh Patel) tries to take her home, but they are overtaken by the collapse of civilisation and begin their new life navigating the disaster together. Though “their” plague is much more devastating than ours (it has a 99% fatality rate), it is still quite something to see people coughing in enclosed spaces while those nearby bristle, and others wonder about masks or gather supplies so they can hunker in apartments until the virus has burned itself out. People die alone, with their loved ones unable to be with them, and people grieve alone. It is almost more discomfiting, however, to be able to point now to moments the creators get wrong. In the very early days, for example, Jeevan and Kirsten go round a supermarket that is full of produce but empty of people. Ah, you say – no. It wasn’t like that. The second timeline takes us 20 years in the future, when Kirsten (now played by Mackenzie Davis) is part of a troupe of actors known as the Traveling Symphony, who tour the midwest putting on Shakespeare plays – Hamlet, when we meet them – to the scattered plague survivors. Even in 2014, I was sceptical that there would be such an appetite. Now I am more so, but beyond the practical, the questions posed by the book and the show about how much of a refuge art can provide, what we should work to preserve, what makes a civilisation and what, ultimately, makes life worth living, remain interesting ones. Station Eleven is a slow burn. The first few episodes look beautiful but move at a stately pace. If you can stick with it, you will be rewarded. Having established its Serious Credentials, it gains confidence and begins to move away from the elegiac tone that threatens to overwhelm it. Backstories are filled in – notably of Miranda (Danielle Deadwyler), Arthur’s lover and the author of the graphic novel (called Station Eleven, but don’t let the meta-ness put you off) that has been Kirsten’s lifeline over her 20 years of post-apocalyptic wandering. Lighter moments leaven the darkness, particularly when the irreducibly charismatic and off-kilter Lori Petty, as the troupe’s composer Sarah, is on screen, or when we flash back to pre-pandemic times. “You seem to get reborn almost every time you leave the house,” says Arthur’s best friend, Clark (David Wilmot, another mesmerising turn), after listening to a California female actor be an excessively California female actor over dinner for too long. Villainry arrives (via the most frightening performance I’ve ever seen, from Daniel Zovatto as the stranger who insists on joining the Traveling Symphony “otherwise your friends are going to start to disappear”), along with the secret community known as the Museum of Civilisation. Further threads arise from the stories of other settlements – one led by Clark and the female actor (Elizabeth, played by Caitlin FitzGerald, who ended up marrying Arthur after an affair they began while he was with Miranda) – and begin to be woven together. We start to plumb the depths of Kirsten’s soul, forged by suffering, saved by the Symphony and ready to save it, too, by any means necessary. We begin, really, to care, to wonder, to ask more questions.

1/30/2022,"My children and I had often looked at the Velvetisers in our local Hotel Chocolat store, and I had dismissed them in the way you do when you really want something, but can’t justify it: simply too expensive (five pence under £100) and what’s more, you can make perfectly good hot chocolate in a pan. Both true.  And then we were given one and all my protestations instantly went away. A Velvetiser is a milk frother into which you put milk and hot chocolate (and, despite what Hotel Chocolat says, you can – and I have – used other hot chocolate flakes/powder) and it heats it and whirs it up and not a single person who I’ve strong-armed to buy one has regretted it. If you have the money and January is making you want to treat yourself, I thoroughly recommend it, after two years of almost daily use. Hotel Chocolat makes lots of hot chocolate to go in it, and seasonal specials some of which I’m not a fan of. It’s best to keep it simple: the 70% is a good one to start with, but I also seriously love the latte sachets and I don’t generally like such things at all. Not for use in the Velvetiser, but the small independent brand Duffy’s has just launched an excellent range of hot chocolate drops of single-origin chocolate from 61% to 70%, £12.45/250g, all absolutely stunning and they can as easily be used in baking, or for snacking.

1/30/2022,"“As children,” Julieann Campbell writes in her introduction to this intricately woven oral history of Bloody Sunday and its long aftermath, “we were told stories about my uncle, Jackie Duddy – a teenage boxing champion – who went on a civil rights march and was shot by British soldiers.” Jackie Duddy, aged 17, was the first fatality on the afternoon of 30 January 1972. A photograph of his limp body being carried by local men, while a priest walks uncertainly ahead of them waving a white handkerchief, has since become the single most memorable image of the day’s horror. For his close family, it is also a constant and painful reminder of the casual brutality of his passing. “We knew Jackie’s face from family photographs, book covers and the Bogside mural,” she elaborates, describing the discomfort she felt as a child “seeing mum subjected to her brother’s dying moments again and again” each time footage of Bloody Sunday aired on the news.  For Campbell, then, this book is a deeply personal, as well as meticulously journalistic, undertaking. (Her previous book, Setting the Truth Free: The Inside Story of the Bloody Sunday Justice Campaign won the Christopher Ewart-Biggs Memorial prize.) Drawing on new and historical interviews with around 110 people, mainly survivors, relatives and eyewitnesses, On Bloody Sunday possesses a veracity and cumulative power that sets it apart from previous accounts. “As a relative,” writes Campbell, “I felt the need to keep asking and keep recording these accounts, knowing just how precious they were.” On the page, one testimony inexorably following another, it is the sense of utter disbelief felt by those caught up in the terror that is most palpable. It is Father Daly, the priest with the white handkerchief, who would later become Bishop of Derry, who captures it most vividly in his description of the frantic moments that followed the first killing. “The paras were still firing, and we decided to make a dash for it to try and get young Jackie away. We were terrified. This seemed like it was in our imagination, like this was film we were seeing. It was hard to believe it was reality.” Fifty years on, that remains the case. Though Campbell provides much-needed context for the massacre, and reprises the families’ long campaign for justice, it is the details of the day that resonate. One local man mistook the sound of the bullets cutting through the air around him for the buzzing of wasps and remembers thinking, “How could there be wasps in January?” A woman who was badly injured by a bullet in the leg remembers looking into the face of the soldier who shot her from just 20 feet away. More chilling is the testimony of a local doctor, Raymond McClean, who came upon two young boys trying to resuscitate a man who was lying on the steps of a square. He was 35-year-old Gerard McKinney, who was already dead. Dr McClean was immediately called to a house nearby, where he found 17-year-old Michael Kelly lying next to Jim Wray, aged 22. “Michael was already dead when I examined him,” he states matter-of-factly. “Jim was also dead... I told the young first-aiders to continue their efforts at resuscitation. I did this mainly to keep them occupied and in the hope that if they were kept busy, they would be less likely to panic.” On the streets nearby, panic spread as people fled the scenes or crouched behind walls, while others lay dead or injured. Seventeen-year-old Hugh Gilmour was shot while running towards his home in Rossville Flats. He died below the window of his parents’ flat. Alexander Nash saw his son William lying by a makeshift rubble barricade on Rossville Street alongside two others, and ran frantically to the spot with his hand raised “to signal that the shooting should stop”. He was hit twice, falling beside the bodies. “I put my hand on my son’s back and said: ‘Willie!’ His eyes were wide open, but I knew straight away that he was dead and that the other two men were dead too.” Amid all this, people risked their lives to tend to the fallen, often crawling to where they lay. For those who witnessed the carnage, and for the families and friends of those killed, the trauma of Bloody Sunday was exacerbated by all that followed: the portrayal of the victims as gunmen and nail bombers by the British army and an acquiescent rightwing media, an initial inquiry-cum-whitewash that exonerated the guilty, and the long cover-up by the military and political establishment. In 2010, a heroically dogged justice campaign by the families culminated with the publication of the 12-year-long Saville inquiry, which found that soldiers from Britain’s 1st Battalion, the Parachute Regiment fired on marchers, none of whom were armed or posed a threat, and that many of the soldiers “knowingly put forward false accounts in order to seek to justify their firing”. Why the regiment was deployed in the first place, being spectacularly unsuited to the task of controlling civilian protest during such a tense and tumultuous time, is a question that also resounds through this book. Campbell devotes a chapter to the Ballymurphy massacre that happened five months before Bloody Sunday, the paras shooting dead 10 unarmed civilians, including a priest and a mother of eight, in nationalist Ballymurphy in Belfast over three nights. She also includes a memo, written in the wake of that horror, and just weeks before the killings in Derry, by General Ford, commander of land forces for the British army, whose decision it was to deploy the Paras. It reads: “I am coming to the conclusion that the minimum force necessary to achieve a restoration of law and order is to shoot selected ring leaders amongst the DYH (Derry young hooligans), after clear warnings have been issued.” Before the terror was unleashed, it was normalised from on high. The findings of the Saville inquiry led to an apology – “on behalf of the government, indeed on behalf of the country” – from prime minister David Cameron. Last year, the director of public prosecutions made the decision to discontinue the case against the single ex-paratrooper, known as Soldier F, who was set to face trial for the murder of two of the victims and the attempted murder of four others. The families have appealed against the decision and their long campaign persists. For the families of those killed, the survivors and the nationalist population of Derry, the events of Bloody Sunday, which shaped the course of the Troubles like no other single incident, remain, as Campbell puts it, “present, debated and unresolved”. Reading her intricately structured account of the day and its long shadow, it is not hard to see why.

1/30/2022,"As the senior civil servant Sue Gray reacted this weekend to calls from the Metropolitan police for her to leave out the most sensitive sections of her report into parties in Downing Street, there was some relief among those close to Boris Johnson. “They think the heat is off them a bit, is the impression I get,” said a respected figure on the Conservative backbenches. “I think this could at least buy them some time.” But at the heart of government things remained chaotic and tense on Saturday. Confusion was rife, and no one knew exactly what would happen next. The Cabinet Office has been handling all matters relating to the Gray report and No 10 was still in the dark about when she would hand over the neutered version to the prime minister.  The two parts of Downing Street were said by one senior Whitehall source not to be talking to each other much as the drama reached its climax. “I have never known dysfunction like this,” said a former Tory cabinet minister. “They are in the same bloody building, they are part of the same operation.” If Johnson was feeling more relaxed at his Chequers country retreat, the same could not be said about large numbers of Conservative MPs. Both among those who want the prime minister gone and those who have yet to make up their minds (who together almost certainly comprise a majority) the feelings were of deepening frustration and mounting despair. Ideally no Tory MP would want to be heading into a leadership contest now, with the pandemic only just easing, a cost of living crisis looming, tensions over Russia and Ukraine rising and local elections around the corner in May. But given the way the “partygate” allegations had been piling up, most had formed the view that the Gray report – published in full – would at least blow the whole thing open and establish the facts. Depending on Gray’s findings and her tone, Johnson would either face a leadership challenge, or the 54 letters from MPs needed to trigger one would not materialise and he could carry on. “Published in full it would allow us to draw a line under the whole disaster, one way or the other. It would be the denouement,” said a Tory MP from the undecided camp. Now, however, the fear is that the Gray report will be too limited in scope to deliver the full facts, or much clarity, and that judgment on Johnson will have to be postponed for weeks or months until the police investigation into partygate is concluded. In that time, Tory MPs say, leadership speculation will not go away. Far from it. Rather, it will just intensify but without a contest being under way. As one former minister put it: “The danger is that everything that happens between now and when the police report comes will be viewed through the prism of leadership and leadership ambitions, not according to the merits of the actual proposals themselves. That is a terrible position for a government to be in.” Increasingly Tory MPs are criticising the Met for allowing the impression to be formed that it was somehow in cahoots with No 10 in trying to get Johnson off the hook. The former cabinet minister David Davis, who has already called for Johnson to quit, told the Observer yesterday that there were no good legal arguments for the Met to call for Gray to redact sensitive parts of her report and that the resulting delay in publishing the facts would mean the prime minister being “tortured” for weeks or months more, rather than being put out of his misery soon. “What we have now is a circumstance where the benefits of the Sue Gray report – that it would bring the thing to a conclusion and then draw a line under it – are all destroyed,” Davis said. “There is no logic behind the police’s request and there is a strong public interest for Sue Gray to publish in full. Otherwise the prime minister could still be being tortured in months and months time. “People will think it is contrived which I am sure it is not, actually. It does put the Tory party in very poor position. It puts the government in a very poor position. This death by a thousand cuts has got to come to an end in order to allow the government to do its job properly and have the bandwidth to do it. It is a real problem.” Conservative MPs were dreading a leadership contest but were steeling themselves for one. Without a candidate around whom a clear majority of Tories could quickly unite, they knew the process would inevitably be messy and divisive. The two cabinet ministers talked of as the most likely successors to Johnson, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss, occupy two of the great offices of state, chancellor and foreign secretary respectively, and would be pitted into a fight for the top job at a time of serious economic problems and international tensions – issues which should be uppermost in their minds. Even those who believe Johnson can survive – and who want him to – don’t think delaying the moment of truth will necessarily help. “It’s an f’ing mess. That is all I know,” one Johnson sympathiser said. Another former minister warned that Dominic Cummings would be relishing the chance to fill the void with yet more claims while the police worked on their report. “The first reaction of people was that this was good news for Boris,” the senior Tory said. “But now we have the prospect of damaging headlines for an indefinite period ahead.”",News/Politics,Tories despair after Gray delay prolongs their leadership crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/30/tories-despair-after-gray-delay-prolongs-their-leadership-crisis
1/30/2022,"Among the many treasures in the British Museum’s forthcoming Stonehenge exhibition is a collection of carved and polished spherical stones, each about the size of a cricket ball. The stones are 5,000 years old and have mostly been found singly in Scotland. The most famous of the 400 or so discoveries is a beautiful polished black sphere from Towie, Aberdeenshire, with three bulbous surfaces, tactile as a miniature Henry Moore. The sphere is carved with precise geometric whorls and spirals. In common with the much weightier neolithic monuments that the Stonehenge exhibition celebrates, the longer you look at the stones, the more mysterious they seem: what and why and how? If the answers to those questions remain unknowable, one thing that the balls – and the culture that prized them – make clear is their creators were people of enormous curiosity and skill, prepared to invest untold hours in making a perfect object, because they could. They were connoisseurs of stone.  I was thinking about the ancient magic of those finds, and their more spectacular counterparts, while driving across Salisbury Plain early one morning last week in the company of Neil Wilkin, the curator of the British Museum’s World of Stonehenge show. With a trace of moon still evident, a thin mist lying in the valleys, and the morning light just beginning to ink in the curves of hills, this landscape can hardly have changed – the A303 and firing ranges apart – since the bluestone and sarsen boulders of the monument were first raised. The 300 sq miles of Salisbury Plain is the largest area of chalk grassland in northern Europe. Its rolling flatness and enormous skies demand some verticality, like the surface of the moon demanded a flag; Stonehenge is, among other things, a monument that gives a sharp sense of identity to the landscape around it. It is, as images ingrained on our collective retina insist, also a place made for sunrise (probably, in terms of its celebrated alignment with the arc of the sun at winter and summer solstice, literally so). On the morning we visited, in common with more than one million mornings before, the silhouettes of the oldest stones came more alive in the light and glow of a wintry dawn, borrowing the pinks and golds of the horizon. In this period of managed access to the site, to be in among the megaliths, in the absence of tourist crowds, felt like a lifetime privilege; in the quiet of the breaking morning, the building feels as it must always have felt, like an awesome natural receptacle for the new day, a singular earthly welcome to the returning sun. It is designed to experience rather than to share: from within the double circle you can capture parts of the ruin, without ever getting the whole in your camera frame. “Why are there so many doors?” the writer John Fowles once heard a schoolboy ask. As the Stonehenge show will illuminate, those doors open up the time and space beyond the monument in multiple different ways. One of those framings is a reminder that the building of Stonehenge was not a single event but a series of interventions in the site, beginning in 3000BC with the first earthworks and spanning 1,500 years – or 90 truncated human generations (each one marked with a painstakingly made axehead on one wall of the forthcoming British Museum show). Our visit to Wiltshire included that constellation of ancient sites that encircles the henge. The earthworks and settlements of nearby Durrington on the River Avon, the extraordinary stone circle and monumental ditch that runs through the centre of the village of Avebury, and the underground hilltop gravesite at West Kennet Long Barrow, approached over farmland. Most of the neolithic and bronze age treasures found by archaeologists and detectorists at such sites are housed in the two neighbouring museums – at Salisbury and Devizes (highlights of the newly marketed Great West Way tourist trail) – and it is from there that many of the prized objects have made their way to London. The British Museum show is, remarkably, the first that it has devoted to this relatively local history. Mired as the museum is in repatriation arguments, it might seem timely and politic to have an exhibition devoted to this island’s insular prehistory. Except, of course, the story is not that simple. • It was the wizard Merlin, according to one 12th-century legend, who brought the rocks of Stonehenge to Britain. In his Historia regum Britanniae, Geoffrey of Monmouth claimed the rocks were first carried from Africa to Ireland by giants, for their healing properties, and then removed by force by 5th-century British knights at the behest of King Aurelius Ambrosius. When the knights were unable to move the rocks, Merlin magically transported them across the water to Somerset. • English architect Inigo Jones (1573-1652) believed that Stonehenge was a Roman temple, and in the 1660s the antiquarian John Aubrey credited its construction to the Celts. His theory was popularised  by William Stukeley, who imagined druids making sacrifices to the sun. Other theories named the Saxons, the Danes and the Egyptians as the builders.  • By the late 19th century, Stonehenge had been dated to the bronze age, long before the arrival of the Celts. That didn’t stop neo-druids and other new age groups laying claim to Stonehenge in the 20th century. The association stuck: in 1984, Spinal Tap professed that the legacy of that “strange race of people, the druids” remained “hewn into the living rock of Stonehenge”.  • The oldest known illustration of Stonehenge appears in the 14th-century manuscript (pictured) of a work by the Norman poet Wace; it shows a giant helping Merlin raise the standing stones.  • In the early 19th century, William Blake, JMW Turner and John Constable all marvelled at the monument and explored its mythological resonances. In the 20th century, Stonehenge was tapped as a symbol of British power and influence:  the Royal Navy named a destroyer and one of its submarines HMS Stonehenge.  • The original function of Stonehenge has long been a matter for debate. At various times it has been understood as a burial ground, a coronation place, an astronomical calendar for predicting solstices and equinoxes, a site of ancestor worship and a place of healing. The mystery of the stones, and their hold upon our imagination, remains as potent as ever today. Killian Fox “I imagine people may come in thinking that this is a show about England,” Wilkin says, “and then be surprised to find that, actually, to understand Stonehenge, you have to keep widening your focus.” For a start, there are the connections to the Preseli mountains of Pembrokeshire from where the bluestones of the original circle came, but Stonehenge further emerges as the hub of a complex network of links to Ireland and Scotland and northern Europe and the Alps. Far from being a nativist emblem, the exhibition argues, the stones are best understood in the context of successive waves of immigration. First from the earliest hunter-gatherer tribes who migrated north across Doggerland, the “sea bridge” to the Kent coast – two extraordinary ancient stag-skull headdresses, about 11,000 years old, one from North Yorkshire, one from Germany, cement this connection. The DNA record shows how these tribes were supplanted in Britain by the first farmers, about 6,000 years ago, who came across the Channel, bringing with them seeds of cereal crops and domesticated cattle and sheep (and building the first stone circles). And then that gene pool is completely disrupted again 1,500 years later, when Beaker people, named for their distinctive pottery, arrived from central Europe, bringing metal to Britain for the first time, entirely supplanting the people who built Stonehenge. The Stonehenge exhibition will give a vivid shorthand story of all these shifting population movements, concentrating on those two millennia in which the first farmers on Salisbury Plain celebrated the sun and the seasons, culminating in that period in which precious metals allowed the worship of golden light to be more personal and portable. The final exhibit in the show is the delicate Shropshire sun pendant, discovered by a metal detectorist in 2018, that comes from the very end of the bronze age in 1000BC. It was probably made by an Irish smithy, reflecting continental European styles. The decoration retains solar symbolism, but now the sun is setting on that world. The show will also demonstrate how, like the mobile populations who have congregated at it for millennia, Stonehenge has never carried a settled meaning. In 1967, the archaeologist Jacquetta Hawkes wrote that “every age has the Stonehenge it deserves – or desires”. If the dominant postwar association was with druidic hedonism (Mrs Thatcher was having none of it: at the 1985 Battle of the Beanfield 537 new age travellers were arrested after clashing with Orgreave-hardened police over plans for a “free festival” among the stones), our own times tend to emphasise the environmental symbolism of the site (English Heritage live-streams the dark night skies above the stones direct to your laptop). Scientific advance has also changed Stonehenge. One new certainty is that Celtic druids, who appeared about 2,000 years after the stones were erected, played no part in the genesis of the monument whatsoever. A Stonehenge exhibition is long overdue in London, Wilkin says, because the twin advances of radiocarbon dating and DNA analysis have revolutionised our understanding of the societies that built these monuments. As a result, he says, with a far more nuanced understanding of surviving objects, “there is a whole new series of stories you can tell about a period of history of which we have been taught to believe we know very little”. For example, forensic geology of an exquisite jadeitite axe head quarried in northern Italy and left as an offering beside the Sweet Track, a wooden pathway built through reed beds on the Somerset Levels in 3807BC, tells a startling story, proving the movement of neolithic people over vast distances. DNA testing of grave remains, meanwhile, establishes specific family relations across generations, giving a new human intimacy to the oldest bones. Some of the most recent work on the stones themselves by the archaeologist Mike Parker Pearson has identified exactly where in Wales Stonehenge’s oldest, smaller, bluestone circle originated. Parker Pearson last year located the spot on a hill called Waun Mawn, where, he believed, the stones, weighing between two and five tonnes, were positioned in a great circle – perhaps for centuries “acquiring holiness” – before being transported the 140 miles to Wiltshire. In a book published to coincide with the exhibition, How to Build Stonehenge, the neolithic expert and British Archaeology magazine editor, Mike Pitts, documents the likely route by sea – navigating the Welsh coast and River Severn estuary – and river and land by which the bluestones most likely travelled. Pitts also surveys the latest work on the methods by which the great post-glacial sarsen megaliths with their unique lintels were hauled from the Marlborough downs, and raised in place. The largest stones weigh 30 tonnes and stand 7m tall – the new research argues that most were transported from a site 20 miles north of Stonehenge and probably moved not on rollers as was previously believed, but on enormous sledges across logs laid as rails. To shape and dress the stones would itself have been a labour of hundreds of thousands of man hours. One conclusion of his book is that the technology, if not the manpower, used to create the henge did not appear from nowhere. There were many wooden structures of a comparable design across Britain and beyond. The British Museum show will include part of the outer ring of the miraculously preserved Seahenge, a contemporaneous timber circle with a great upended oak tree at its centre, roots turned to the heavens. The Seahenge had been preserved in peat and sand in north Norfolk, until it was exposed by rising sea levels in 1998, its 4,000-year-old bark still intact. A closer understanding of the lives of the people who built the henges, and who moved these great stones, suggests a high level of commonality and shared purpose. The skeletons found in the burial sites near the Wiltshire monument show comparatively little evidence of violence. Wilkin suggests that “the act of building was perhaps as important as the building itself”. Not far from Stonehenge is Silbury Hill, the largest manmade structure in Europe in 2400BC, and of similar height and volume to the roughly contemporary pyramids in Egypt. Excavation shows no tomb beneath the great mound, however. The latest theories suggest that its construction, over several generations, was a community endeavour, perhaps a collective rite of passage, a great monument to pastoral co-operation. The sarsen uprights of Stonehenge, and the long avenue that approached them, appear to have been constructed as this kind of society, with its deification of stone, was first beginning to come under threat. The discovery of the grave of the “Amesbury Archer” when the foundations of a new primary school were dug in 2002 in a village three miles from Stonehenge is early evidence of this great technological and social shift. The man, who was in middle age, died 4,350 years ago and was buried with numerous objects that included five Beaker pots, three copper knives, a pair of gold hair ornaments, a small anvil used in metalworking and 122 pieces of worked flint, including the arrowheads that gave him his nickname. When the grave was first discovered the tabloids christened him the “king of Stonehenge” but the truth of the mix of grave relics makes him even more fascinating. While the pots are in the new Beaker style that originated in continental Europe, they were likely to have been manufactured locally. By contrast, the gold ornaments are made in a British style but from metal that was probably from mainland Europe. Examination of the isotopic composition of the man’s teeth suggested that the Amesbury Archer had grown up in the western Alps before travelling to Britain later in life. Piecing these bits of information together, archaeologists conclude that this man was among the very first to bring the magical knowledge of how to manufacture copper to Britain, which perhaps guaranteed him such a high-status burial; DNA analysis of a companion grave nearby show it to be that of the man’s great grandson, who had been born in Wiltshire but spent part of his life abroad. In the centuries that followed, such individual graves became more common, in contrast to the collective burial sites of the earlier period. The appearance of metal objects, including gold, in these graves seems to coincide, the exhibition suggests, with new social networks and trading routes related to the ever-increasing demand for metal. The implication of single-occupancy graves was mirrored above ground where farmland becomes enclosed. Stonehenge continued in this period as a significant and perhaps sacred site, with burial mounds constructed all around it, but the implications of the new detailed DNA and dating advances are that the collective agrarian spirit that enabled it gave way to a more modern sense of individuality and selfhood and ownership. (The idea of Stonehenge as “property” persisted – it was bought as recently as 1915 by a locally born barrister, Cecil Chubb, for £6,600, as a present for his wife. Three years later, he handed it back to the nation in exchange for a baronetcy.) “We talk about connectivity a lot,” Wilkin says, “but I think what’s different about it here is that we’re using those connections to explain some of the real fundamental changes that happened in this period of European history: the rise of individualism, the introduction of farming, the settlement of the lands and enclosure in the middle bronze age which eventually seems to have led to greater conflict and warfare.” In between these times there is a long period of competing traditions in which marvellous metal objects were made to celebrate and explain the movement of sun and stars as the great stones had once perhaps done. The earliest such object in the world, the Nebra Sky Disc, an exceptional loan to the British Museum from the Halle State Museum of Prehistory in Germany, probably dates from about 1550BC. Its gold relief against a dark night sky background is the first-known metallic depiction of the cosmos. More than that, though, its genesis reflects a Europe of constantly shifting and mixing populations: it is made of Cornish tin and gold and incorporates astronomical knowledge from Scandinavia, the Mediterranean and Egypt. Ideas that were once set in stone are now free to travel.

1/30/2022,"The hugely successful Danish pop phenomenon Mø is best known as a featured artist. Her collaborations with people such as Major Lazer and Justin Bieber have been streamed billions of times. The downside of this ubiquity was burnout, vocal injury and anxiety. A 2019 break to recuperate and course-correct has resulted in an album made in Copenhagen, mostly with Scandinavian women rather than American men: heavyweights such as Noonie Bao (Sweden) and Caroline Ailin (Norway), who co-wrote New Rules with Dua Lipa. Motordrome – Mø’s third LP – refers to the “wall of death” in which a motorcyclist zooms round a circular space, defying gravity: it’s a nod to both the pop hamster wheel and the churning of Mø’s mind. If that all sounds downbeat, the recent pop era has been rife with uplifting bops about previously poor self-care. Mø’s new-era singles thus far have been earworms – the euphoric Live to Survive, the Ed Sheeran-like Kindness, the more recent electronic ballad Goosebumps. The remainder of Motordrome mostly maintains this hit rate, with New Moon and Wheelspin reiterating themes of renewal after trials.

1/30/2022,"As drivers budget for the year ahead, they face the prospect of an unwelcome increase in the price of motoring – a rise of 10% in insurance premiums. New figures show that the average annual premium exceeds £700, a sharp increase on the same time last year, as the end of travel restrictions increases the risk of people getting into accidents.  Figures from comparethemarket.com for Cash show that the average premium comes in at £703 a year for new customers – up £67 on last January. The rises include both comprehensive cover, which has gone up by £63 to £679 a year, and third-party, which has increased by £56 to £1,621. The figures are calculated by taking the average of the lowest five prices on the market. Drivers with diesel cars have seen their premiums go up to an average of £716 from £658 last January. Petrol vehicles, meanwhile, are up to £695 from £621 in 2021. Electric car drivers, however, saw their bills go down from £678 to £629 on average. One factor behind the increase is the end of lockdown restrictions. As drivers did not need, or were unable, to get behind the wheel for significant parts of last year, premiums were lower. But with the relaxation of restrictions comes freedom to get back on the roads, and the possibility of more collisions, says Ryan Fulthorpe of price comparison site GoCompare. “Last January we were in lockdown, which meant there were fewer people on the roads and in accidents, therefore claims costs and insurance costs were lower. Now we are in a new normal, those prices have been rising,” he says. Insurers have also seen the cost of repairs to vehicles go up. The British Insurance Brokers’ Association (BIBA) says that more sophisticated cars can result in higher bills. “The costs of car repairs are increasing because of the increased use of technology,” it says. Admiral, the biggest car insurance company in the UK, says traffic has returned to pre-pandemic levels and accidents have also increased. “On top of this, the insurance industry is experiencing inflationary pressures from increased repair costs, parts shortages and labour costs which all impact on the cost of claims,” it says. This month has seen the most significant shake-up to the industry for decades, as insurers are now banned from quoting policyholders a higher price to renew than they would offer a new customer. The move follows complaints that customers who regularly switched were paying much lower premiums than those who renewed. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) says it is too early to tell what impact the new reforms have had. It says that data from the ABI for the first nine months of last year showed premiums were at the lowest level in five years, although those figures are calculated in a different way to statistics from price-comparison websites. It suggests that increasing costs for insurers could continue. “There remains cost pressures, particularly around rising repair costs that may have a greater impact going forward,” a spokesman said. The one relief for drivers is for those who have gone green and drive electric vehicles (EVs), premiums have dropped by 7%, according to the comparethemarket data. Fulthorpe says insurers are now better informed about how much it costs to repair EVs. “They are able to understand a lot more about them,” he says. “At the start of last year, they did not have enough data to build their pricing models to accurately quote for the actual risk. Now there is plenty more data on the cost to repair and the correct repairers to approve.” So should you still shop around, even though the new price rules have come into effect? Yes, it is always worth looking to see if there is a better deal elsewhere with another insurer, even if it can be a laborious process. MoneySavingExpert recommends getting quotes on all of the four big comparison sites – MoneySuperMarket, comparethemarket, Confused.com and GoCompare – to get a full view. It is then worth checking with Direct Line, which only offers products directly. After that, look at cashback sites to see if you can get any money back by buying through them – for instance, Quidco offers up to £35 if you use it to purchase a policy.  Be wary of over-insuring your vehicle. Look out, too, for automatically included features such as breakdown cover which may be included with your bank account, or key cover which you may already have on home insurance.  Watch the excess. The amount you pay when you make a claim is typically between £100 and £500. Increasing it will cut your premium. But take into account that setting it too high will prove costly if you do make a claim.  The cheapest time to get a quote is just over three weeks before the policy begins, according to research by MoneySavingExpert. It puts the optimal time to get a price at 23 days before, after which prices tend to rise.  Installing “black box” technology in your vehicle, which tracks how you drive, can tell the insurer how safe you are and may reduce your premium.

1/30/2022,"Ministers face calls this weekend to publish an investigation into how more than 700 Russian millionaires were fast-tracked for British residency via a “golden visa” scheme exposed for lax checks on illicit funds. The government said six months ago that it was finalising its report into tier 1 investor visas granted to the super-rich from several countries, including Russia, China and Kazakhstan, because of concerns over “dirty money”. It now faces calls to suspend the golden visa programme until the review is published.  Under the scheme, launched in 2008, applicants provide a minimum investment of £2m in exchange for the right to live in Britain. They can later apply for full citizenship and a passport. The Liberal Democrat peer Lord Wallace has tabled an amendment to the nationality and borders bill in the House of Lords, requiring the scheme to be halted until the review is published. He said: “It’s claimed we are a great global country, but we are behaving like Cyprus and Malta by selling residency.” Britain faces criticism over claims it has failed to properly monitor the billions of pounds of Russian money which has flowed into London over the past two decades. A report by the Center for American Progress, a think tank close to the Biden administration, warned last week that “stronger action” against money laundering was required from the UK, which had become a main hub for Russian oligarchs and their wealth. It said more effective action would be required from the UK in the event of tough sanctions against Russia over the Ukraine crisis. The government has promoted its golden visa scheme around the world over the last decade. Campaigners highlighted that the government was creating a “hostile environment” for illegal immigrants at the same time as selling residency to the super-rich. The controversial programme came under scrutiny after the Russian state was blamed for the novichok poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury in March 2018. Transparency International warned that the scheme had been “wide open” to abuse by corrupt individuals because of the very limited checks that had been carried out on the source of their wealth. It was revealed six months after the Salisbury attacks that the government was conducting a review of golden visas handed out between June 2008 and April 2015. It was reported at the time that officials were scrutinising more than 3,000 visas, including more than 700 handed to Russians. There are also hundreds of dependants of successful visa applicants who have been permitted into the country under the scheme. It was reported last year more than 6,300 visas are now under review. New reforms to the scheme were announced in March 2019, including better checks on the source of funds and the requirement for an applicant to have a UK bank account. A report by the charity Spotlight on Corruption, called Red Carpet for Dirty Money, was published in July last year and warned of continuing weakness in the golden visa regime, which it said relied too heavily on financial institutions to conduct anti-money-laundering and due diligence checks. Susan Hawley, executive director of the charity, said: “We know Russia has wanted to infiltrate people in the UK and this has been a very easy route to do that. They must be laughing up their sleeves that this country is such an easy touch in allowing people in without proper checks. The government needs to urgently publish its review into the scheme and we need an independent audit of whether it meets its original purposes and whether it is fair.” Ministers were warned by parliament’s intelligence and security committee report on Russia in July 2020 about risks of the golden visa scheme. It said London had become a popular destination for Russian oligarchs and the key to London’s appeal was “the exploitation of the UK’s investor visa scheme”. The report said: “The UK welcomed Russian money, and few questions – if any – were asked about the provenance of this considerable wealth…What is now clear is that it offered ideal mechanisms by which illicit finance could be recycled through what has been referred to as the London laundromat.” John Penrose, the Conservative MP and the government’s anti-corruption champion, is among those pushing for more state action against illicit finance. He accused the government last week of stalling on an economic crime bill that would have exposed the owners of shell companies used to buy British property and introduced new reforms for Companies House. He warned Putin would “be looking for any signs of weakness that we aren’t serious about threats to sanction his oligarchs.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “We reformed the tier 1 visa route in 2015 and in 2019 to crack down on dirty money and we have not ruled out making further changes. “These changes have included requiring banks to confirm they have completed all due diligence checks prior to opening accounts and increasing the requirements for applicants to provide evidence of the source of their funds.”",News/World news,UK urged to suspend ‘golden visas’ after fast tracking of Russian millionaires ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/30/calls-for-uk-to-suspend-golden-visas-after-fast-tracking-of-russian-millionaires
1/30/2022,"Conor Burns, one of the troupe of Johnson loyalists willing to humiliate themselves on behalf of the prime minister, now knows the first line of his obituary. It will be his attempt to excuse Boris Johnson’s lockdown-busting birthday party inside Number 10 with the immortal phrase “he was, in a sense, ambushed with a cake”. This deserved all the mockery it got, but it is by no means the most desperate of the arguments being offered by those trying to save the prime minister’s skin.  First came all those false denials that there had been any partying at Number 10. Then the prime minister was forced to admit he went to a “bring your own booze” bash in Downing Street, a confession that came with the ridiculous alibi that he mistook a garden full of people chugging drinks for a “work event”. His most pathetic excuse has been to suggest he had no idea what was against the rules. Even if you find it kind of plausible that such a recklessly irresponsible man was clueless about the laws enacted by his own government, ignorance is no defence. Many Johnson apologists have been pushing this line as a strategy to trivialise the scandal. This version comes from the veteran Tory MP, Sir Edward Leigh: “When Europe stands on the brink of war and with a cost-of-living crisis, can we please have a sense of proportion over the prime minister being given a piece of cake in his own office by his own staff?” A lot of citizens were punished for much smaller gatherings than the birthday party in the cabinet room and we know that this was just one of at least 15 revelries in Number 10 during some of the most intense periods of the pandemic, including a raucous booze-up on the eve of Prince Philip’s funeral. This is not about “a piece of cake”. It is about whether the prime minister and his staff broke the lockdown rules that they imposed on the rest of the country and then lied about it. The Metropolitan police, which was previously very reluctant to get involved, would not now be conducting a criminal investigation if it regarded it as trivial. The Met commissioner says the police already has evidence of “serious and flagrant” breaches of the rules. We can probably all agree that Britain would be better off if Downing Street had its full attention on the Russian threat to Ukraine, soaring energy bills and the squeeze on the standard of living. We instead have a prime minister whose time is consumed by clinging on to his job. If Sir Edward and other Tory MPs want a leader focused on dangers abroad and crises at home, then they will need to get a new one. This contribution, almost as priceless as “ambushed with a cake”, came from the Essex Tory, Andrew Rosindell. Mr Johnson has robbed his high office of dignity, credibility and authority. Tory MPs do the same to their party the longer they go on trying to defend him. This line is a favourite of Mr Johnson himself and one that he fell back on again at the most recent prime minister’s questions. The fatal flaw is that it is not true. Elements of Britain’s response to the pandemic have been impressive, notably the rapid development and distribution of vaccines. The credit for that primarily belongs to brilliant scientists and the efficiency with which the NHS got jabs into people’s arms. We should also take our hats off to Sir Patrick Vallance, who created the vaccine task force, and the task force’s leader, Dame Kate Bingham. The “big calls” for which Mr Johnson had prime responsibility were about the timing of lockdowns and these he judged so badly that Britain has the highest death toll in Europe. Crispin Blunt, the Conservative MP for Reigate, dismissed lockdown-busting at Number 10 with the claim that “probably inside most homes and inside most businesses, and inside most places of public administration, people may not have kept absolutely to the rules”. I’d previously taken Mr Blunt to be one of the better minds in his party. His dreadful defence demonstrates that the effort to save Mr Johnson is turning intelligent men into wretched dolts. Surveys suggest that most of the public were highly compliant with lockdowns, often making agonising choices and sacrifices to help with the life-and-death struggle to contain Covid. Even if some people did break the rules, that doesn’t make it fine for the prime minister and his staff to be among them. Lawmakers cannot be law breakers. This claim by Mr Johnson is not aimed at you or me, but at Tory MPs’ havering over whether to trigger a confidence vote. He wants them to believe that his eviction would be a dream result for the opposition. Some Labour MPs do think that, even after all this, he would probably be a more formidable opponent at the next election than any of the alternative leaders available to the Tories. But the majority view within Labour’s ranks is that they are best served if he manages to limp on at Number 10 with his reputation shredded. This contention has been pushed by Nadine Dorries and Jacob Rees-Mogg, both famous constitutional non-experts. It is notable that the rest of the cabinet have eschewed this argument. It is easy to see why, especially in the cases of Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss. Were they to take this line and then find themselves prime minister they would have sworn up to calling a snap election whether or not it suited the Conservatives. Voters might want an election in the event of a change at the top. The opposition would very likely demand one. There’s a case to be made that a new prime minister ought to seek a fresh mandate from the public. But there is absolutely no requirement for this to happen. The two most recent changes of Tory prime minister – Cameron to May and May to Johnson – were not immediately followed by an election. Nor were the transitions from Eden to Macmillan, Macmillan to Douglas-Home, Wilson to Callaghan, Thatcher to Major and Blair to Brown. The claim there would have to be an election is a crude and bogus attempt to scare Tory MPs. What a change of prime minister would certainly mean is a new cabinet. That’s what really worries Ms Dorries and Mr Rees-Mogg. This one is changing into “delay for the detectives”. Johnson loyalists are gleeful that the Met has asked Ms Gray not to reveal key details of the eight events under police investigation. The prime minister reckons this will buy him more time, but Tory MPs should ask themselves for what purpose the time is being bought. Voters have already made up their minds that rules were broken. If Ms Gray’s report is published in heavily redacted form, which now appears to be the intention, it will look like a Whitehall whitewash. The police investigation could drag on for weeks, even months. If it ends with Mr Johnson slithering free, the public will conclude that it was an establishment stitch-up. Even if the police investigation results in convictions, some around the prime minister are blithely shrugging that this wouldn’t be so serious because the penalty for breaking Covid laws is usually a fine. By talking about this as if it would be no worse than receiving a parking ticket, people at Number 10 reveal that they still haven’t grasped the gravity of this scandal. “I’ve been out and about with my constituents in Great Grimsby,” the Tory MP Lia Nici told the Commons. “They are sick and tired” of hearing about lockdown-busting parties at Number 10 and “want him [Johnson] to carry on getting on with the job”. If this is really true, Great Grimsby has a political microclimate entirely unlike anywhere else in the country. All the opinion polling suggests that voters are furious with the prime minister and a substantial majority, which includes about half of those who voted Conservative in 2019, think he should be removed from office. What they are sick and tired of is him and being taken for fools by his apologists.

1/30/2022,"Eight years on from the Trojan horse affair, Birmingham is braced to revisit memories of the difficult period as a new podcast examines the incident for an international audience. The divisive scandal thrust the city under the national spotlight in 2014 after a fake letter claimed there was a plot to Islamise schools, resulting in a crackdown on a number of teachers. The podcast, created by the New York Times and Serial, will investigate who was behind the Trojan horse letter, and what their motivations were in sparking the national panic.  In late 2013, a photocopy of a letter, which appeared to be correspondence between Muslims plotting to take control of local schools, was sent to Birmingham city council with an anonymous note by someone claiming to have found the document in their boss’s office. The document was leaked to the press in 2014, and although the letter was quickly debunked as a fake, the accusations took on a life of their own. Albert Bore, leader of Birmingham city council until 2015, said that at the time of the scandal there had been serious concerns that “there might be an undermining” of Birmingham’s Muslim community “for years to come”. Bore, who is interviewed in the podcast, said that the council “did not accept” the approach taken by Michael Gove, who was then education secretary. Bore referred to the appointment of Peter Clarke, the former head of counter-terrorism with the Metropolitan police, who had the task of investigating the scandal, saying: “Two people were appointed to look into Trojan horse, one appointed by the city council and one appointed by Michael Gove. Michael Gove’s person was a former counter-terrorism person. So that underlines where he was coming from.” The letter resulted in a crackdown, with more than a dozen teachers barred from teaching before most of the bans were overturned. Bore said the concerns about the scandal’s impact on young people persisted until the story faded away: “Throughout that period, the city council was concerned about the immediate impact upon the Muslim community and particularly young people, and how detrimental it might be to them. Those concerns continued for a few years until the Trojan horse story sunk.” Similar fears were raised at the time of the scandal, with Labour MP Shabana Mahmood warning in 2014 that children in Birmingham risked having their futures harmed by allegations aimed at their schools. “There will always be children in Birmingham living with that stigma, day in and day out,” she said at the time. Samira Shackle, a freelance journalist who investigated the scandal in 2017, said there were potentially two sides to the subject being re-opened. “People who were involved have a sense of being hard done by and wanting the case to be heard,” she said. “On the other hand, I think there is an element of old wounds being opened. Because lots of people in the wider community just kind of want it to go away… the media scrutiny was so intense. “Regardless of what details come out, a lot of it is still talking about already marginalised areas being spoken about in the framework of extremism and radicalisation, and actually without very much foundation,” Shackle said.",News/Media,US podcast on Birmingham’s Trojan horse affair threatens to ‘reopen old wounds’,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/30/us-podcast-birminghams-trojan-horse-affair-reopen-old-wounds
