1/10/2022,"Corporate life in Japan can be so intense that dying from overwork is not unheard of. Last year, the government recommended that companies allow staff to opt for a four-day workweek. Panasonic recently announced it will start offering the four-day workweek to interested workers. Electronics conglomerate Panasonic is the latest major Japanese company to announce a four-day workweek to interested employees, Nikkei reported. ""We must support the well-being of our employees,"" Panasonic CEO Yuki Kusumi told investors at a recent briefing, according to the outlet. Known for its intense work culture, corporate life in Japan can be so unforgiving that dying from overworking is not unheard of. In a bid to improve the country's work-life balance, the Japanese government last June recommended that companies allow staff to opt for a four-day workweek, reported German broadcaster DW. Panasonic's Kusumi said the company is looking to support diversity as some workers may have side jobs or personal interests apart from their primary employment, according to public broadcaster NHK. The company is also moving toward more flexible work arrangements. This includes encouraging more employees to work remotely and allowing workers to decide if they want to transfer to another city without their families — a common corporate practice in the country, the NHK reported. Panasonic joins a handful of Japanese companies introducing four-day workweek arrangements, including pharmaceutical firm Shionogi and systems developer Encourage Technologies. Both will offer the option from April, per Nikkei. About 8% of Japanese companies offered more than two days off a week in 2020, Nikkei reported, citing an official survey. In the US, the four-day workweek has been floated for decades, but remains out of reach for many workers, Insider's Chris Weller wrote in November. But this could be changing as the pandemic accelerates the war for talent, Jackie Reinberg, a senior director at Willis Towers Watson, told Weller. Last week, San Francisco-based e-commerce startup Bolt permanently switched to a four-day workweek after a trial saw improved productivity and work-life balance.

1/10/2022,"Rioters stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021, in an attempt to overturn the presidential election. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson condemned the events of January 6 but did not call it an insurrection. January 6 was an ""interference with the lawful transfer of power using violence,"" the governor said. During a Sunday interview with Jake Tapper on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson was reluctant to label the January 6 attack on the Capitol an insurrection, yet described it as one by definition. ""Some people are going to call it an insurrection. Some people are going to call it terrorism. I call it interference with the lawful transfer of power using violence, and that's wrong,"" Hutchinson said. The Republican governor paraphrased the definition for insurrection provided by dictionary publisher Merriam Webster: a usually violent attempt to revolt against or take control of a civil authority or established government. On January 6, violent protesters attempted to enter the Senate chamber, forcing US lawmakers to evacuate and abandon the task at hand: certifying President-elect Joe Biden's 2020 election win. While members of Congress were eventually able to return and finish the certification, it took authorities several hours to regain control of the Capitol building, which resulted in multiple deaths. Despite his indecisiveness on how to label the events of January 6, Hutchinson told Tapper that what happened should not be minimized. ""Let's accept what it is. Let's don't run from it. Let's learn from it and let's make sure that we don't fall down that path again. For the long term, we have to show to the world that we're not going to accept that as how we transfer power in elections in America,"" Hutchinson said.

1/10/2022,"New York City officials say a devastating fire that killed nearly two dozen people in the bronx on Sunday was sparked by a malfunctioning space heater. ""This is going to be one of the worst fires that we have witnessed during modern times here in the city of New York."" Mayor Eric Adams confirmed nine of the victims were children, and dozens more have been injured and hospitalized. The deadly blaze broke out in an apartment spanning the second and third floors of the Twin Parks North West building, which provided affordable housing. Fire commissioner Daniel Nigro said 200 firefighters battled the heavy smoke, which spread quickly because the apartment door was left open. ""This smoke extended the entire height of the building, completely unusual. Members found victims on every floor in stairwells and were taking them out in cardiac and respiratory arrest."" Nigro added that the building did not have external fire escapes, and residents were meant to evacuate through the smoke-filled interior stairways. Officials said those who need housing would be registered and placed in hotels until it was safe to return to the building. The catastrophe is likely to stir questions on safety standards in low-income city housing, after another deadly residential fire in Philadelphia earlier this week. Neither the building's owner or property manager immediately responded to requests for information on its fire safety record and inspection history.",World/Reuters Videos,Deadly NYC fire sparked by space heater,https://news.yahoo.com/deadly-nyc-fire-sparked-space-054958213.html
1/10/2022,"ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) -The Tigray People's Liberation Front, the party that controls most of the northern Ethiopia region of Tigray, on Sunday accused Eritrea of attacking its troops. In another development in the conflict, aid organisations suspended their operations in an area of northwest Tigray where 56 civilians were killed by an air strike over the weekend, the U.N. agency for humanitarian affairs (UNOCHA) said. ""The Eritrean military launched fresh attacks against our forces yesterday in Sigem Kofolo... located in Northwestern Tigray close to Sheraro town,"" TPLF spokesman Getachew Reda wrote on Twitter. Reuters could not verify the alleged attack as the communication network is down in the area. Eritrean Information Minister Yemane Gebremeskel did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Ethiopia's military spokesman Colonel Getnet Adane and government spokesman Legesse Tulu did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's spokeswoman Billene Seyoum also did not respond to a request for comment. A lack of medicines, fuel and other essential commodities was ""disrupting the response to the injured,"" UNOCHA said in a statement announcing suspension of operations following the air strike that hit a camp for internally displaced people late on Friday. ""Humanitarian partners suspended activities in the area due the ongoing threats of drone strikes,"" the agency told Reuters, without giving further details. War broke out in the mountainous region of 5 million people 14 months ago, pitting Tigrayan forces against federal troops backed by their Eritrean counterparts. Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki told the state-run Eri-TV on Saturday that his troops would strive to prevent Tigrayan forces from attacking his country, or threatening the stability of Ethiopia. Eritrean forces have fought against Tigrayan forces since the start of the war in support of Abiy's troops, but both nations spent the first five months of the conflict denying the Eritrean presence. The Eritrean troops withdrew from most of the region in June, the same month that Ethiopian federal troops also withdrew. Last month, Tigrayan forces withdrew from neighbouring regions they had invaded in July, in a step toward a potential ceasefire. Reuters has reported atrocities by all sides, including Eritrea, which the parties to the fighting have denied. The conflict in northern Ethiopia has killed thousands of civilians and displaced millions.
