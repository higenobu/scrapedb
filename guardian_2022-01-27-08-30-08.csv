1/27/2022,"Reports of hate crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the city of San Francisco increased dramatically last year, according to new police data, in what law enforcement called an “alarming rise”.  Preliminary data from the San Francisco police department showed reports of incidents where police believe an anti-Asian bias played a role jumped from nine in 2020 to 60 in 2021, a 567% increase, in the city of 875,000 people. San Francisco police warn the figures are probably an undercount because hate crime incidents are underreported. The department’s data is also considered preliminary since the California department of justice makes final determinations on data counts for hate crime reporting in the state. One man is allegedly responsible for half of the reported incidents. According to local news reports, the man allegedly vandalized 20 separate stores across the city, mostly targeting Chinese-owned businesses. The new data comes as several high-profile attacks and killings have placed renewed attention on violence affecting Asian Americans across the US. In March 2021, a gunman opened fire at several Atlanta massage parlors, killing eight people, including six Asian women. Reports of robberies, burglaries and deadly assaults on multiple elderly Asian Americans in the cities of Oakland and San Francisco left communities reeling. Across the US more than 9,000 anti-Asian incidents were reported between March 2020 and June 2021. Reports of hate incidents against Asian Americans jumped during the pandemic, a rise experts have blamed in part on discriminatory rhetoric from Donald Trump, who repeatedly used racist terms in reference to Covid-19. “We had a campaign and administration that openly appealed to racial resentment and xenophobia,” said Jack Chin, a professor at UC Davis law school. “The administration was repudiated in the election, but that didn’t go away just because Trump lost.” In May 2021, Joe Biden signed the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act, aimed at combatting the rise by expediting the review of hate crimes at the justice department and making grants available to help local law enforcement. After the mass shooting in Atlanta, police across the US, including San Francisco, increased patrols in Asian American communities. That presence may have helped increase reporting of bias incidents, Chin said. “This is always the challenge to figure out whether an increase in reporting is an increase in incidents or whether it’s an increase in willingness to report,” he said. “It’s hard to say, but it’s absolutely the case people are more likely to report if they believe it’s worth their time to report in that police and prosecutors will care and will do something.” Hate crimes have one of the San Francisco police department’s highest clearance rates for any crime, Bill Scott, the police chief, said. “We hope that sends a forceful message to would-be hate criminals considering any kind of bias-motivated attack in our city – San Francisco will hold you accountable.” Along with anti-Asian hate incidents, domestic violence and gun violence in the most underserved communities have also risen during the pandemic. “The general level of resentment by everyone about everything is going up,” Chin said. “People are committing more acts of discourtesy, acts of violence. Everything from harsh language to shooting people over a parking spot.”",News/US news,SF police data shows 567% increase in reports of hate crimes against Asian Americans,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/26/san-francisco-increase-hate-crime-anti-asian-aapi
1/27/2022,"The music streaming platform Spotify is in the process of removing Neil Young’s music after the company refused to take down Joe Rogan’s podcast amid the musician’s objections that it spread vaccine misinformation. Rogan has been described by the New York Times as “one of the most consumed media products on the planet”. His podcast, the Joe Rogan Experience, is Spotify’s most popular. In 2020, Rogan signed a $100m deal that gave the streaming giant exclusive rights to his show.  But this week, Young posted an open letter to his manager and record label that was later taken down in which he said: “With an estimated 11 million listeners per episode, [The Joe Rogan Experience], which is hosted exclusively on Spotify, is the world’s largest podcast and has tremendous influence. Spotify has a responsibility to mitigate the spread of misinformation on its platform, though the company presently has no misinformation policy.” The musician added: “I want you to let Spotify know immediately TODAY that I want all my music off their platform … They can have Rogan or Young. Not both.” A Spotify spokesperson confirmed to the Hollywood Reporter on Wednesday that the platform was taking down Young’s music. “We want all the world’s music and audio content to be available to Spotify users. With that comes great responsibility in balancing both safety for listeners and freedom for creators. We have detailed content policies in place and we’ve removed over 20,000 podcast episodes related to Covid since the start of the pandemic. We regret Neil’s decision to remove his music from Spotify, but hope to welcome him back soon,” the spokesperson said. Since the pandemic, Rogan, who has legions of devoted followers, has repeatedly spread misleading and false claims. A few weeks ago, 270 doctors, scientists, healthcare professionals and professors wrote an open letter to Spotify, expressing concern about medical misinformation on Rogan’s podcast. The letter highlighted a highly controversial episode from last December that features Robert Malone, a virologist who was involved in the mRNA vaccine technology that led to some of the leading Covid-19 vaccines but has since been criticised for spreading vaccine misinformation. “This is not only a scientific or medical concern; it is a sociological issue of devastating proportions and Spotify is responsible for allowing this activity to thrive on its platform,” the letter read.",News/Technology,Spotify removes Neil Young music in feud over Joe Rogan’s false Covid claims,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/26/spotify-neil-young-joe-rogan-covid-misinformation
1/27/2022,"Prince Andrew has demanded a jury trial in Virginia Giuffre’s sexual abuse lawsuit against him, yet it is not the first time a member of royalty has faced court proceedings. The British monarchy faces the prospect of one of its most senior figures being questioned by legal professionals over his alleged sexual abuse of a minor in a US court, allegations he has denied.  But there have been several other occasions when charges have been brought against royalty. Here is a brief rundown of when royals have run into trouble with the courts. The Princess Royal became the first member of the present royal family to be convicted of a criminal offence when she pleaded guilty to a charge under the Dangerous Dogs Act. One of her dogs, a three-year-old English bull terrier called Dotty, bit two children as they walked in Windsor Great Park on 1 April 2002. She was fined £500 for the attack and ordered to pay £250 in compensation and £148 in costs at a magistrates court in Slough. The district judge, Penelope Hewitt, spared Dotty’s life. Princess Anne was also convicted of speeding in her Bentley after admitting driving at 93mph in a 70mph zone in Gloucestershire. The princess was fined £400, ordered to pay £30 costs and given five penalty points on her driving licence. In her written evidence to the magistrates court in March 2001, the Princess Royal said she thought the police cars on her tail were providing her with an escort. She said she had been on her way to an official engagement when she was caught in a line of slow-moving traffic on the A417 dual carriageway near Brockworth. Going back several hundred years now, Charles I was brought to trial in Westminster Hall on 20 January 1649, following the end of the English civil war. The king appeared before his judges four times, charged with tyranny and treason. The exchanges generally focused on the king challenging the court’s authority and its right to try him. In the end though, he was condemned to death on 26 January of the same year and beheaded four days later outside the Banqueting House in Whitehall, London. In the previous century, Mary, Queen of Scots was implicated in the Babington Plot – a plan in 1586 to assassinate her cousin Queen Elizabeth I and put Mary on the English throne. She faced trial for treason before a court of 36 noblemen, where she denied all charges, urging her triers to “look to your consciences and remember that the theatre of the whole world is wider than the kingdom of England”. Although she argued that she had been denied the opportunity to review the evidence, was denied access to legal counsel and that she had never been an English subject in the first place, she was convicted and sentenced to death. It isn’t just the British monarchy that has had legal troubles over the years either. Former Spanish king Juan Carlos I is the subject of several criminal investigations, with an inquiry launched in 2020 to establish any involvement in a €6.7bn deal with Saudi Arabia. It is in connection with the construction of a high-speed rail line between the Saudi Arabian cities of Medina and Mecca by a Spanish consortium. Juan Carlos is currently living on Zaya Nurai Island, which is a convenient 15 minutes by boat from the United Arab Emirates, but is reportedly seeking a return to his homeland.",News/UK news,Prince Andrew: which other royal figures have faced legal action?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/26/prince-andrew-which-other-royal-figures-have-faced-legal-action
