12/24/2021,"Boris Johnson can “get away with things that mere mortals can’t seem to”, the former prime minister David Cameron has said, while suggesting there has been an “arms race” between politicians and the media to outwit one another. Johnson’s team have significantly changed relationships with the media – hiring personal photographers on to the No 10 staff who often snap key events instead of photographers from media organisations.  Johnson has also used taped clips to make announcements – including most recently the announcement of no new restrictions before Christmas – instead of appearing at a press conference or in front of MPs. In an interview with Adam Boulton for Feral Beasts, a documentary exploring Britain and the media, Cameron said the relationship had become more adversarial. “I think there has been a bit of an arms race in a way,” Cameron said. “Politicians have tooled up with special advisers and the spin doctors, and the media have tooled up by even more aggressive gotcha interviews to get that magic moment.” “I think we have got to try and have a relationship still distant and confrontational by moments – but understanding that you have got legitimate questions, but we have also got a responsibility to explain what we are doing. And can we try and find a bit of space for those things to coexist.” Cameron had also made a request for a personal official photographer, which was declined, which prompted him to say Johnson could get away with more than others. He also criticised the prime minister’s decision to boycott appearances on BBC Radio 4’s flagship Today programme – his appearance on the show in October was the first time he had been on it in two years. Cameron was criticised during his time in No 10 for avoiding press scrutiny. As Conservative leader he had pledged to hold monthly press conferences but those were soon ditched. “But, look, I think you shouldn’t do this to bypass the media. You go on having … whether it is press conferences or interviews or media events – this is important,” Cameron said. “And I always did. Yes, the press conferences were rather infrequent, but I never held back from going on the Today programme and coming on your show. “I mean, we were always available and keen to engage and to answer questions.” Johnson had promised a more open relationship with the press with plans for televised media briefings from a £2m refurbished media suite and hired Allegra Stratton as an official spokesperson to front them. But rows over the briefings eventually led to the departure of several senior staff and they were cancelled. Stratton resigned this month after footage leaked of briefing rehearsals in which staff joked about Downing Street Christmas parties.",News/Politics,"Boris Johnson can ‘get away with things’ others can’t, says David Cameron",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/24/boris-johnson-can-get-away-with-things-others-cant-david-cameron
12/24/2021,"Antonio Conte has criticised Thursday’s meeting between the Premier League and managers as a waste of time – because he believes everything was decided in advance. Tottenham’s manager barely concealed his frustration as he described a meeting intended to discuss issues arising from the latest Covid outbreak – including player welfare and fixture congestion – as like talking to a wall.  ”If I have to be honest, it was a meeting where we tried to speak and some coaches tried to speak, to ask about solutions but I think everything was decided,” said Conte. “It was a wall. For this reason, I prefer not go into the discussion.” When asked if the meeting was a waste of time, Conte replied: “I think so. Because when you have a wall in front of you, you can speak and ask for what you want, but every decision was taken.” Conte’s side have been hit hard by a Covid outbreak which led to the postponement of two fixtures: a league game against Brighton and the Europa Conference League match against Rennes. The Tottenham manager warned that the glut of fixtures over the Christmas period, with games against West Ham, Crystal Palace, Southampton and Watford over an 11-day stretch, would put even more pressure on his squad, which he said was still feeling the effects of Covid. Sunday’s game against Palace is followed by Tuesday’s visit to St Mary’s. “It is not easy for us, and it is not easy for all the teams,” he said. “To play after only one day is not simple. You have to manage the situation very well because of the risk of losing players to injuries, so we have to pay great attention, especially my team. “Don’t forget we had half our squad with Covid – and then you have to live with this situation for two to three weeks after you finish Covid. We have to try to manage the situation very well because for sure physically the players with Covid are not 100% fit. So in these next two games we try to rotate the players to find a good balance and a good solution.” Conte said he would monitor Harry Kane’s fatigue levels especially closely, and was aware that his captain had ruptured a hamstring on New Year’s Day in 2020 after a busy period of games. “I know this and it’s difficult to start the game without Harry because he is a point of reference in our team,” said Conte. “I will speak to him and with all the players because I want to understand very well what is their real physical condition, and if there is someone that has a bit of fatigue.” Norwich also face games on Sunday and Tuesday after a recent Covid outbreak that forced off one of their fixtures and their manager, Dean Smith, said: “We are having to push rehab forward and people are breaking down in rehab because of that … It is lunacy that we are having to play two games in 48 hours and there has got to be a question about the integrity of the competition when teams are playing weakened teams against other teams and it is affecting league positions.”",Sport/Football,‘It was a wall’: Antonio Conte left frustrated by Premier League meeting,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/24/antonio-conte-premier-league-meeting-like-a-wall-waste-of-time-tottenham
12/24/2021,"Ministers have chosen a senior banker as the new chair of NHS England, with a brief to push through changes in the way the service operates and cut spiralling waiting lists. Richard Meddings, a former chair of TSB Bank, will take over the role early in the new year. He will be paid £63,000 a year for working two to three days a week, the Cabinet Office said .  He will succeed Conservative peer Lord Prior of Brampton, who has held the post for four years. However, unlike Prior – who had been a health minister and chaired two NHS hospital trusts before taking over – Meddings is not thought to have any previous experience of the health service. He is taking over at a time when the government is keen for the NHS to improve the way it works, and use innovative means to tackle the 5.7 million-strong backlog of care patients, and deliver value for money for the record funding it is due to receive in the next few years. A 1.25% rise in national insurance in April will yield about £12bn a year to help improve both healthcare and social care. The Cabinet Office said in a statement on Thursday: “Richard Meddings has been named as the government’s preferred candidate for the next chair of NHS England. “Sajid Javid, the secretary of state for health and social care, has today invited the health and social care committee to hold a pre-appointment scrutiny hearing with Richard.” The Commons committee, chaired by the former health secretary and Tory leadership contender Jeremy Hunt, will question Meddings at a confirmation hearing early next year. However, while it can offer Javid its thoughts as to his suitability for the post it cannot block him from taking up the role. The Daily Telegraph, which revealed the appointment, quoted a Whitehall source who said Meddings “has unrivalled business experience and will bring an outsider’s eye to the NHS”. The source added: “We can’t have business as usual when it comes to the health service. Reform is needed to deliver an NHS that serves patients for years to come.” Meddings will take over shortly before changes contained in the health and care bill going through parliament hand Javid much more control over NHS England and reduce its independence from the Department of Health and Social Care. They will also formalise major changes in the way the NHS in England operates through the creation of 44 “integrated care systems”, which bring providers of different types of health services and local councils together across a region. Meddings, whose background is in chartered accountancy, is also a non-executive director of the Treasury. He has held a number of other senior roles in banking.",News/Society,Former banker Richard Meddings to become chair of NHS England,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/24/former-banker-richard-meddings-to-become-chair-of-nhs-england
12/24/2021,"As the highly transmissible Omicron variant began to surge across Colorado this month, Governor Jared Polis adopted a laissez-faire tone. Asked in a radio interview about the possibility of reinstating a statewide mask mandate, he replied that, with Covid vaccines now widely available, getting sick was the “own darn fault” of the unvaccinated. But health workers at hospitals in parts of Colorado that have been overwhelmed by coronavirus patients in recent weeks say they’re bracing for even worse.  “We are encountering what almost feels like a war zone these days,” said Stephanie Chrisley, an intensive care nurse at Longmont United hospital, about 50 miles north of Denver. She says she is sometimes tasked with caring for twice the number of patients she’d normally be responsible for. The job, she said, has become “morally distressing”. Hospitals like Chrisley’s are preparing for an even bigger surge, one that will put the most vulnerable residents at risk. And as state leaders across the western US take a hands-off, wait-and-see approach to handling the new variant, experts worry that relying on vaccines alone without additional public health measures won’t be enough. Vaccination rates across many western states are high, with between 60% and 70% of residents in Oregon, California, Washington, Colorado and New Mexico having been fully vaccinated (though not necessarily boosted). But Omicron, now the dominant variant in the US, appears to be more effective than previous variants at infecting even the doubly vaccinated. “In this moment, I would not agree with this sort of throwing the hands up and saying this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated,” said Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, chair of the epidemiology and biostatistics department at the University of California, San Francisco. “The spirit of public health is that we have to think collectively.” Unlike Colorado, California reinstated its statewide indoor mask mandate last Wednesday. But the state has so far avoided issuing the stay-at-home orders it used to curb infections last December, leaving it up to restaurants and businesses to decide whether or not to scale back service or close. Residents, meanwhile, have been left to individually assess the risks of dining out, going to the gym or meeting with friends and family for the holidays. In Oregon, officials this week warned that a winter surge would tip already strained hospital systems across the state over the edge and in New Mexico, some hospitals had already been operating under “crisis standards” of care, as patients with Covid-19 and other ailments overwhelm emergency rooms and intensive care units. In contending with the Omicron variant, one year on from when western states faced a devastating surge and some of the highest case and death counts in the country, Bibbins-Domingo said aggressive vaccination drives and testing, as well as masking rules, will be required to weather the coming months. “Now is not the time to put any of our tools away,” she said. “We need all our tools to keep rising cases of both the Delta and Omicron variants under control.” Each state has “some things it’s going well and some things it could be doing better”, she added. Colorado could consider reinstating mask mandates, though the state’s push to provide free testing to residents is commendable, Bibbins-Domingo noted. In California, stronger masking rules are likely to help stem the spread of the virus. But getting rapid at-home tests remains costly and inconvenient, hurting low-income workers at risk of exposure to the virus and who are most in need of frequent testing. Although a double dose of vaccines seems to protect people from severe illness and hospitalization, workers at restaurants, grocery stores, food processing centers and other jobs where they must interact in close quarters with other people could still carry and transmit the omicron variant to older and immunocompromised relatives, she said. Relying on vaccines alone also leaves out those who are struggling to access vaccines, or are unable to take them due to age or preexisting conditions. In many parts of California, Colorado and the broader west, vaccination rates among Latino residents have lagged, a reality that experts say is at least in part due to a lack of outreach and access. Across California, data have also shown lagging vaccination rates among the poorest residents. Even those who want vaccines may face language barriers in scheduling a shot, said Ninez Ponce, a professor of public health at UCLA and the principal investigator of the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS), the largest state health survey in the United States. Others who work multiple jobs while juggling childcare may have trouble finding the time off to get a first dose or booster. Chrisley, the ICU nurse, said she was disheartened by Polis’ stance that the unvaccinated only have themselves to blame for contracting the virus. “I have a three-year-old who can’t be vaccinated yet. I have friends who are getting treatments for certain illnesses, which prevents them from being able to get vaccinated. There are people who have allergies to certain vaccines,” she said. Just the vaccines aren’t enough to protect everyone, she said. Moreover, especially amid severe medical worker shortages, a surge of unvaccinated Covid-19 patients in hospitals will mean that patients with other illnesses and injuries will be left with nowhere to go for treatment – and everyone will suffer. Nurses at Chrisley’s hospital recently led a drive to unionize, saying that their workload was unsustainable. “This has always been a hard job, but it has been getting harder,” she said. At the PIH Health Good Samaritan hospital in Los Angeles, Jennifer Delisle – a medical surgical and orthopedic nurse – said that while the scene this winter is a lot calmer and more in control than it was last year, when LA endured the worst of the pandemic and overflow morgues were set up outside to hold the dead, she is growing uneasy about the months to come. She has seen Angelenos grow laxer about social distancing and masking, forgoing face coverings while holiday shopping, she said. And vaccination rates are stagnating. “People are letting their guard down,” she said.",News/US news,"As US west braces for omicron surge, leaders take a hands-off approach",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/24/us-hospitals-omicron-covid-colorado-california
12/24/2021,"If you witnessed Mark Zuckerberg’s unveiling of the “Metaverse” this year, you’ll be familiar with his utopian vision: a future in which we abandon our woefully outdated reality in favor of his virtual world. After all, what could be better than surrendering the very concept of observable truth to the man whose service has convinced your aunt that elites want to drink the blood of children? The Zuckerbergian digital universe isn’t quite ready yet, but with Christmas around the corner, we took an educated guess at what the holidays might look like under the incoming regime.  It all begins on a cozy winter’s evening. Instead of bundling into the car with the family, you simply tap a button on your VR goggles. Instantly, you’re transported to a customized digital environment – perhaps somewhere with a Dickensian flourish, such as a Victorian workhouse, or one of the kooky spots featured in Zuck’s demo video, such as the lifeless blackness of the cosmos. Everyone is there: Aunt Dakota, Uncle Logan, your cousins Edith and Walter, Grandma and Grandpa. And is that Great-great-Uncle Harry? It is! He died last year, but a little thing like that won’t stop his avatar from showing up. It’s programmed with all his favorite anecdotes and jokes – in fact, it’s so lifelike that as the years go by, you’ll forget entirely which relatives are still actually breathing. Of course, because everyone’s chosen an avatar, there are no familiar faces. So you’ll have to make educated guesses about who’s who as you approach giant T-rexes and smiling robots – don’t want to accidentally get stuck making small talk with weird cousin Andrew, who is either that zombie in the corner or the knife-wielding guy in the hockey mask. On the plus side, no one has aged a day since you last saw them. It’s been a while, so you’ll need an icebreaker. Just as it was last year, the go-to topic is the plight of the “phizzies” – the new underclass that can’t afford Zuck’s goggles and still lives in the physical world. Your progressive relatives bemoan their plight, while your more callous family members have a good chuckle, wondering what it must be like to be left behind in a world where matter is still a thing. Soon it will be time for dinner – which is never as filling as it used to be, given that it’s made up of mainly zeroes and ones. But wait, the fabric of reality is tearing over by your stepdad, and … yep, someone’s hacked Christmas again. A pair of alien avatars have appeared out of nowhere and started doing weird sex stuff, which, to be fair, accounts for most of what happens in the Metaverse. Doing your best to avoid stray pulsating tentacles, you push them back into the rift they emerged from, making a mental note to contact Meta’s support staff yet again. Finally you all sit down for your meal, though before the food will materialize, you’ll of course need to chant the Pledge to Lord Zuckerberg. When it’s complete, a disembodied blue thumbs-up briefly appears over the table and dinner begins. Edith and Walter are late to the table; they’ve been in the real-life bathroom, vomiting from what doctors have termed goggle-derived motion sickness (GDMS). Conversation is, unsurprisingly, dominated by your conspiracy-theorist uncle, who has spent the whole night waiting for JFK Jr to show up – which, in this reality, is not outside the realm of possibility. After dinner it’s time for entertainment, and it’s the Metaverse, so you’re excited for an appearance by a big star, digitized. It’s Christmas, so how about Mariah Carey? Turns out she’s only available as an NFT, and she costs Z1m (1 million Zuckcoin). You settle for Michael Bublé again. While he belts out Jingle Bells, you begin handing out the presents, bracing for the yearly tantrum when the kids, who legally can spend only 95.3% of their waking hours in the Metaverse, realize their new toys don’t actually exist. Finally, the evening is over, and people begin spontaneously disappearing as they teleport to their virtual bedrooms. The holidays make you nostalgic, so you decide, for old time’s sake, to pull off the goggles. As your eyes adjust to the physical world, you watch your immediate family stumbling into walls and bumping into each other, their vision blocked by their headsets.

12/24/2021,"People at greater risk of becoming seriously ill from Covid-19 will likely have more treatment options in January. That’s the forecast in the wake of the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval this week of the first two antiviral pills used to treat Covid-19 and reports of shortages of a monoclonal antibody treatment used against the Omicron variant.  “Other companies are developing monoclonals that should work against Omicron, but all of that takes time, so these antivirals slot in almost perfectly to where these monoclonal antibodies are no longer useful,” said Andrew Pekosz, an epidemiologist from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The need for more options to treat Covid has increased not only due to the spike in cases, but also because only one of the three monoclonal antibody treatments used to treat Covid has proven effective against Omicron, and it’s now in short supply across the country. Pekosz added: “As long as production and distribution of the [antivirals] can be geared up, they will be an important tool, especially in the short term, to fight off severe disease.” The shortage of the monoclonal antibody treatment and FDA approval of the pills from Pfizer and Merck are important factors as hospitals try to contend with Omicron, which is more contagious than previous variants and has led to a sharp increase in Covid cases in New York and has emerged in many other parts of the US. But epidemiologists and public health officials around the country do not know exactly how the initial limited supply of the pills will be distributed. “There are still a number of questions about how efficient the system will be to get these pills to people in time” to treat them, said William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. On Wednesday, the FDA approved a Pfizer antiviral, Paxlovid, that reduced the risk of hospitalization among high-risk patients by 89% when they took it within three days of the onset of symptoms and almost the same amount when taken within five days, according to a Pfizer study. The agency approved the pill for people ages 12 and up at high risk of severe illness from the virus. The US government will have 265,000 Paxlovid treatment courses available in January and 10m courses by late summer, White House Covid-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients said at a briefing. On Thursday, the federal agency authorized a Merck antiviral, Molnupiravir, that has not been shown to be as effective as Paxlovid against hospitalization from Covid. It’s approved for the treatment of mild to moderate Covid in adults at high risk of severe illness from the virus. The federal government also pre-purchased 10m Molnupiravir treatment courses and expects to have 3m courses available in January, Zients said. Covid patients’ access to the antiviral pills will depend on how efficiently the federal government distributes the pills to states and community health centers, said Schaffner. “We have not seen the logistics laid out as to who needs to be called right at that critical time” during the first few days after a person develops symptoms and tests positive for Covid, said Schaffner. “You want to get these pills as quickly as possible so that you can avert the infection evolving into something more serious that gets you into the hospital.” Even though the Merck pill has lower efficacy against the virus than Pfizer’s, Pekosz still recommended that people at high risk from Covid who become sick take “whatever anti-viral drug is available”. France canceled its order Wednesday for the Merck antiviral because of data showing that it only reduced the risk of hospitalization and death by 30%, compared with preliminary data that showed a 50% reduction. “Given the Omicron situation here in the US, the choice between nothing and the Merck, there is absolutely no [question], I would absolutely take the Merck drug if that was the only thing available,” Pekosz said. Dr Farrin Manian, an infectious disease specialist and chair of the department of medicine at Mercy Hospital St Louis, said he was excited about the Pfizer antiviral but more hesitant about the Merck pill, which attacks the virus’s genes, because of the theoretical concern that it could alter the genome of the patient’s cells, leading to a possible increased risk of birth defects and cancer. Manian also emphasized that people’s access to the antivirals will depend on their access to Covid tests, which have been in short supply in the United States. “I am hoping that we will have more testing available to the public so that when these drugs do become available, the testing will not be a huge obstacle,” said Manian. In addition to people who are elderly or immunocompromised, the new antivirals could also help people who are not vaccinated against the virus and as such, at much greater risk of becoming seriously ill or dying. “I think these medications are likely to be looked upon with favor by a lot of people who are vaccine averse, and so in a sense, they actually may continue to slow down the acceptance of vaccination,” said Schaffner. “That’s too bad because then we have lost half of our one-two punch.”",News/World news,More options for Covid treatments in January as FDA approves two antiviral pills,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/24/covid-treatment-antiviral-fda-monoclonal-shortage
12/24/2021,"The government is to hold emergency meetings with the bosses of the UK’s biggest energy suppliers, after providers warned on Thursday of a “national crisis” that could see bills skyrocket more than 50% to £2,000 a year. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, is to hold virtual meetings on Monday with energy suppliers, who are pushing the government to intervene to alleviate the unprecedented rises in consumers’ bills caused by soaring wholesale gas prices.  The energy industry believes the crisis, which has seen more than 26 energy suppliers go bust at a cost of £1.8bn to date, could be made more manageable if the government axed the 5% VAT on bills imposed when the UK was part of the European Union. Other interventions the industry would like to see considered include extending fuel grants and moving green levies from consumers’ bills into taxation. Trade body Energy UK said on Thursday that consumers can expect their bills to soar by as much as 50% from 1 April. While wholesale prices continue to climb steeply, the UK’s price cap on energy bills stops companies from immediately passing those costs on to their customers. The price cap, set by the industry regulator, Ofgem, has been at a record £1,277 Since 1 October. Ofgem is expected to raise the cap significantly on 1 April. EDF has said the cap could hit £2,000 by next October, when the cap is reviewed again. Analysts at Investec believe the expected bill increase in April would add 1.8 percentage points to inflation next year. On Thursday the shadow energy minister, Ed Miliband, called on the government to stop families being “clobbered” with the increased cost of heating and powering their homes, by removing VAT on bills for six months. Spain has cut energy taxes, while Germany has slashed green levies on household bills, designed to support the development of renewable energy. But Energy UK said measures like these would save less than £300, significantly less than the expected £600 rise in the average annual bill when the price cap goes up. One plan being formulated by the energy industry to would involve a government-administered loan scheme to spread the impact of the price increases over several years. The plan would involve one or more commercial lenders – such as banks – covering the immediate cost of buying energy on wholesale markets at record prices, with a sum of at least £7bn. The loans would not require a government guarantee, but officials would be responsible for ensuring repayments.",News/Business,Kwasi Kwarteng to meet energy leaders over energy price crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/24/kwasi-kwarteng-to-meet-energy-leaders-over-energy-price-crisis
12/24/2021,"Since the beginning of the pandemic, a low-key but persistent source of irritation has been how impossible it is to focus. “I can’t do anything,” is a line I’ve exchanged with friends countless times, by which we mean anything more energetic than scrolling. For the past 12 months, at the end of most days, the scene has been exactly the same; I’m out cold on the sofa, dazed from hours of binge-watching, as a prelude to dragging myself to bed. It’s a dull, depressing and nutrient-free way to pass the time. It’s also a hard habit to break. For many of us, the biggest casualty has been reading. Books – in particular, in my case, fiction – have seemed to require unearthly levels of engagement. For months at a time, no book has appealed, and every title picked up has been put down. Across my apartment, along with the unwashed cups and stray socks, is an archipelago of books started and abandoned. As the pandemic wore on, the New York public library system stopped charging fines for late returns, removing the single incentive I had to finish anything.  It’s odd how disturbing this became. I remember looking at my bookshelves, full of books shipped, years ago and at enormous expensive, across the Atlantic from London. Via the order on the shelves, I could trace the years of my most voracious reading, when one volume led to another, and another, and another. I saw, too, how this energy had dwindled over the years to much more occasional enthusiasms. There had always been lulls and lags, long periods in which nothing quite took. But it had never been like this. I wondered if it had as much to do with middle age as the pandemic. Perhaps I had entered that period – like the moment a Radio 1 DJ glides, seamlessly, into Radio 2 and then death – when things simply stopped interesting me. Perhaps, I thought with panic, this was it. I’d aged into some fundamentally incurious state, filled up my hard drive, irreversibly burned myself out. The situation led to some desperate measures. Perhaps the way to jump-start this, I thought, was to be hardcore. All right, I’m not going to write a novel during the pandemic, but maybe I can force myself to actually read one. One night, after the kids were asleep, I resisted another episode of Friday Night Lights and cracked the spine on Swann’s Way, a book that, at a conservative estimate, has moved with me unread across three countries and seven addresses. “For a long time I would go to bed early.” Aaaaand I’m out. Other failures followed. If Proust was a bit much for my degraded system, how about the Collected Short Stories of John Cheever, a book I’ve been meaning to read since picking it up in a secondhand bookshop in Provincetown, Massachusetts, eight years ago? I ploughed through seven short stories, all beautifully written, some a little dated, and none of which could persuade me to keep reading. I tried a comfort read: Valerie Grove’s excellent biography of Dodie Smith, which I love, but couldn’t settle to. Maybe horror was what I needed, to match the inside with the outside world. But Shirley Jackson’s We Have Always Lived in the Castle dragged, and Thomas Ligotti, whom I’d half been looking forward to reading, didn’t quite take off, either. The one success I had, last summer, was with Zadie Smith’s Intimations, six essays on the pandemic that briefly lifted me out of my slump. But it was over very quickly and didn’t lead to anything else. What fixed things, in the end, was shame. Every night, my two six-year-olds have a homework assignment of 25 minutes’ set reading. They are frequently grumpy about it, and I’m frequently cross with them. “How come we have to read and you don’t?” asked one, a few weeks ago, and she had a good point. While they read, I almost always scrolled on my phone in what parents have been taught to refer to as bad modelling. Reluctantly, I sat down with them on the sofa for the 25 minutes, and forced myself to read. I opened Zora Neale Hurston’s Their Eyes Were Watching God, which has sat unread on my shelf for 10 years, and either through its brilliance, or the psychology of the timer, it instantly worked. After finishing, I flipped to Penelope Lively’s Moon Tiger, which was exactly what I needed: the long view taken by an old lady dying in hospital, reminding me that all things will pass. Last week, I started Elizabeth Taylor’s Angel. A long time ago, I had loved books by Taylor, but from the cover this one looked aggressively boring and I was spitefully testing myself. Oh my god, books are amazing. It’s impossibly good.

12/24/2021,"Jenny Harries, the chief executive of UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), has urged the public to carry on getting boosted and not to be alarmed by press coverage about waning immunity. Harries conceded that booster vaccines had waning immunity against catching Omicron after 10 weeks, but said the jabs would still help prevent serious illness and death.  She also said findings suggesting the Omicron variant could be less likely to result in serious illness than Delta offered a “glimmer of Christmas hope … but it definitely isn’t yet at the point where we could downgrade that serious threat”. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, she said: “Despite the headlines people need to really understand that a booster dose is absolutely vital.” Asked about research showing that booster efficacy against Omicron infection waned after 10 weeks, Harries pointed out it would still be effective against severe disease. She said: “Our vaccine programme has always been around ensuring individuals don’t get severe disease, and fatalities from this infection. It’s entirely natural that after a vaccine, whether it be for Covid, or other infections, that our immune response wanes over time.” She added: “I don’t think people should think that the data around 10 weeks is just an indicator against symptomatic infection. We anticipate it will have a very significant positive impact on preventing serious illness and death.” Harries also suggested the government might consider new restrictions in England based on the impact on the workforce, not just preventing hospitalisations. Boris Johnson decided against imposing any further restrictions for England over Christmas but has indicated he could act afterwards. Harries said: “Ministers will look at all of the data that we have available – and that isn’t simply what the epidemiology is saying, it’s how it’s impacting society. So, for example, we have very high rates of individuals off sick – we know that particularly in London, around one in 35 have currently got Omicron. Now that’s having an impact on the workforce. So these are not simply about hospitalisation rates.” She said ministers were being kept updated daily in a process that would continue throughout the Christmas period. She said key pieces of information about Omicron were still needed to understand how much of a risk it posed to the health service. Harries said: “We don’t yet know what the average length of stay for an individual is in a hospital … I don’t think we do know yet that this is going to be a significantly less serious disease for the population – the older population – that we are normally most concerned about in relation to serious disease and death.” The UKHSA estimates that someone with Omicron is between 31% and 45% less likely to attend A&E and 50% to 70% less likely to be admitted to hospital than an individual with the Delta variant. Harries added: “What we have got now is a really fine balance between something that looks like a lower risk of hospitalisation, which is great news, but equally a highly transmissible variant and one that we know evades some of our immune defences, so it is a very balanced position.”",News/World news,UK health agency chief urges people to keep getting Covid boosters,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/24/uk-health-agency-chief-urges-people-keep-getting-covid-boosters
