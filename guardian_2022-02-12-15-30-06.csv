2/12/2022,"On Sunday morning I wake to the sound of the dog and the cat fighting at the foot of the bed. Looking over the edge, I see a miniature re-enactment of a wildlife programme: a small leopard trying to take down a tusk-less warthog, only the warthog thinks it’s a game. You can imagine how frustrating this is for the would-be predator. It leaps out from behind a chair and pounces, sinking its teeth into the dog’s flank; the dog, wagging its tail, reaches round and presses the cat’s head to the floor. Then they pause, resume their former positions and start again.  “It’s not natural,” I say. “They’re playing,” says my wife, who already seems to be up and dressed. “It will end badly,” I say. “I’ve got us an appointment at the dump for 11,” she says. “So you might want to think about getting up.” With this, she leaves the room. The animals stop fighting and follow her. My wife does her best to make the trip to the dump sound like both a date and a hot ticket, as though she’d had to pull a few strings to make it happen. I will later find out that dump appointments are not at all hard to come by. Not even on a Sunday. Our dump appointment comes the day after I spent an hour searching for a particular kitchen implement and failed to find it, which puts me in a suspicious frame of mind at loading-up time. “Of course, I’ll need to check all these bags,” I say to my wife. “Don’t start,” she says. “You threw away my bench scraper, so I know what you’re capable of,” I say. The dog and the cat roll past between us, end over end. “I don’t even know what a bench scraper is,” my wife says. “Exactly,” I say. “So you just put it in the bin.” “We’re going to miss our slot,” she says. The most exciting thing about our date is that we’re going to a new dump. They closed the old dump, which was overseen by an angry man who sat in a folding garden chair and shouted at people for mixing plastics. The new dump is a mystery. My wife drives. The dog sits on my knees, watching the road. “Will they let us dump paint?” I say. “Who knows?” my wife says. The new dump is miles away, down a long straight road that ends in a sentry hut with a man in it. “We’re ridiculously early,” my wife tells him. “What’s your booking reference?” he says. “No idea,” she says. She picks up her phone and scrolls through her emails. “I can’t find it. What do you do with people who can’t find their booking reference?” “Go on up,” he says. This is when I realise the dump is not quite as exclusive as I had been led to believe. The new dump is staffed by a man who does not sit in a garden chair; instead he approaches you and answers questions politely, like a waiter. There are the usual containers for metal and cardboard, but there is also a giant concrete pit where you can dump everything else. “Can I put this in there?” my wife says, holding up a flattened old suitcase. “Of course, madam,” says the man. “What about this?” I say, opening a bin liner full of glass and cardboard. “Put it all in cardboard,” he says. “What, all together?” I say. “Yes, it’s all recycling,” he says, smiling. I grab another bag full of heavy broken things, too tightly knotted at the top to check its contents, and with a pang of guilt I sling it into the big pit. But when I peer over the edge my sack of mystery waste seems uncontroversial: there are whole living rooms of stuff down there, whole kitchens, tumbled up in piles, waiting to be crushed. The guilt ends up in the pit with everything else. “Well, I would definitely go there again,” I say as we glide down the exit ramp. “I wish I’d brought more stuff now,” my wife says. “Yes, you could have thrown away all my shoes and books,” I say. “Next time,” she says. Sitting on my knees, the dog is shaking uncontrollably. “What’s wrong with you?” I say. “She’s frightened of the dump,” my wife says. “Frightened of that dump?” I say. The dog goes still for a second, and then resumes its shaking. “Come on,” I say. “Let’s get you back to the cat.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Tim Dowling:‘My wife’s idea of a hot date is trip to the dump’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/12/tim-dowling-my-wifes-idea-of-a-hot-date-is-a-trip-to-the-dump
2/12/2022,"Lindsay-Jean Hard is one of my zero-waste heroes. Her book Cooking With Scraps (Workman, £14.99), which was born out of her column of the same name for Food52, is full of intriguing recipes and ideas such as artichoke leaf nachos, coffee ground cashew butter and her renowned recipe for banana peel cake, in which the surprisingly flavourful peel replaces the bananas themselves. Here is my wholemeal version of that cake, which, with the addition of unrefined sugar and wholegrain flour, becomes seriously toffee-like (and especially so when drowned in the toffee sauce icing). I’ve also introduced brown bananas into the recipe, baking them on top of each cake, but that’s entirely optional if you have another use for them.  For this cake, Hard keeps banana peels in the freezer until she needs them; she also says they’re great in smoothies. Although my version of her cake is wholemeal, it’s still light and fluffy. Serve with or without the toffee sauce icing. For the cake2 organic brown bananas100g salted butter250g unrefined sugar3 small eggs, separated120ml buttermilk or yoghurt200g light wholegrain spelt flour2 tsp baking powder1 tsp baking soda For the toffee sauce icing100g salted butter150g muscovado sugar40-50ml whole milk200-250g icing sugar – I make my own by blending muscovado or unrefined sugar to a powder in a high-speed upright blender Peel the bananas, set aside the fruit, and soak the skins in cold water for an hour, replacing the water twice during that time. Drain, put the skins in a saucepan, add fresh water to cover, then bring to a boil and simmer for five minutes. Drain, then blend the skins to a puree, loosening the mix, if need be, with some of the cooking liquid. Cream the softened butter and unrefined sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg yolks, reserving the whites for now, then add the pureed banana peel and the buttermilk or yoghurt, followed by the spelt flour, baking powder and baking soda. Whisk the egg whites to soft peaks, then fold into the cake batter. Divide the cake mix between two greased and lined 18cm round cake tins. Cut the reserved brown bananas in half lengthways and lay them cut side up on top of the batter. Bake in a 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 oven for 35 minutes, until a skewer comes out clean, then remove and leave to cool. To make the frosting, if using, melt the butter and muscovado, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Add the whole milk and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Leave to cool a little, then stir in the icing sugar. The mixture should now be spreadable; if not, add more icing sugar until it is. Unmould the cakes, put one on a platter and spread a third of the icing over the top. Put the second cake on top, and spread the remaining icing over the top and sides, allowing it to drip down, then slice and serve.",Lifestyle/Food,How to turn banana peel into a stunning cake – recipe,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/12/how-to-turn-banana-peel-into-a-stunning-cake-recipe-zero-waste-cooking
2/12/2022,"The vaquita, the world’s tiniest marine mammal, has long teetered on the brink of extinction. The population of porpoises marked with black ringed eyes and smiling, upturned mouths has dwindled by a devastating 99% over the last decade. Now scientists say their future is more precarious than ever, after a recent survey found less than 10 individuals left in the waters of their limited home range between Baja California and Mexico.  But some say there is still hope for the endangered species that has persisted against the odds. “We are looking for a needle in the haystack – but we know the needle is there,” says Barbara Taylor, a marine conservation biologist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, noting how researchers can still hear their high-pitched calls and echolocation clicks, collected on auditory monitoring equipment placed throughout their habitat. Taylor has tracked endangered species that have been pushed out of existence before and she’s determined to stop the small, shy, cetacean from joining that list. The task won’t be easy. Vaquitas continue to face a host of threats, including a lucrative illegal fishing industry, political apathy and conservation measures that have been largely ineffective. Vaquitas share the Gulf of California with highly coveted sea creatures including the totoaba, an endangered fish with perceived medicinal properties that retails in China’s black market for thousands of dollars. Vaquitas, alongside sea turtles and whales, can easily become entangled in the massive mesh netting known as “gillnets” used by totoaba poachers and local fishers. The US has sought to put pressure on Mexico over the issue. On Thursday, the Office of the United States Trade Representative announced that it was requesting consultations with the Mexican government over whether environmental commitments made under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement – which replaced Nafta in 2020 – that were intended to protect vaquitas had fallen short. The US has also enacted embargoes on the Mexican seafood industry, including banning importation of seafood typically caught in gillnets in vaquita territory. Last year, the US also stopped importing all Mexican wild-caught shrimp citing concerns over sea turtle protections. The Mexican government has outlawed totoaba fishing and made the use of gillnets in the area illegal, but few of the promised penalties have been carried out. There have also been efforts made to compensate fishers who replace the dangerous gear but the funds were not equitably distributed, frustrating fishers who were left in the lurch. Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who oversaw a policy reversal and rolled back enforcement in the protected area has spoken out about sanctions against the Mexican seafood industry and international interventions. Meanwhile, as enforcement from authorities waned, illegal fishing has flourished. Backed by the cartels, the expansion of the totoaba market has coincided with vaquita numbers dropping roughly 50% annually. International advocates have struggled to shift the tides. “When we were out there the last three times it was gillnets everywhere,” Taylor says of survey trips that took place in 2018, 2019, and earlier this year. Without strong consequences or enough compensation, there’s little motivation to change. Called the “cocaine of the sea”, totoaba prices far outpace anything fishers could make in above-board markets. Cartels have cashed in, further increasing the incentives to ignore the regulations. “There was no one that was trying to hide anything from us,” Taylor said. Even those who appreciate the danger vaquitas are in have raised questions about the value of protecting them at the expense of local livelihoods. Local economies and culture are closely entwined with fisheries in the vaquita range. Even before the totoaba market exploded, gillnets were used to catch blue shrimp and other species that dwell in the biodiverse waters. “The government still hasn’t given us a solution or an effective way to support our families without going out to fish illegally,” Ramón Franco Díaz, president of a federation of fishing cooperatives in San Felipe, told the New York Times last autumn. “The children need food and clothes.” “For many of the local community the vaquita is a nuisance that the sooner it goes extinct the better, because then they can poach unhampered,” said Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow in the Center for Security, Strategy, and Technology in the Foreign Policy program at Brookings. She noted that these issues have existed in the Gulf of California for decades, predating the spike in overseas demand for totoaba, and highlights the “enormous challenge” inherent in environmental conservation. “The issue of how to fund conservation - paying communities not to poach - is something that we are really going to be confronting at a greater scale,” she said. Vaquitas have never been particularly abundant. They tend to produce calves only once every two years and it takes decades for them to mature and reproduce. But Felbab-Brown says that the absence of law enforcement in the area has only exacerbated the issue. “The sense is that anything goes,” she said. “Now in a situation where we have 7 or 8 vaquitas left.” Without local support and enforcement, environmentalists say it will be even more difficult to pull the species back from the brink, especially now that time is running out. “The reason it really is not working is there isn’t the governance to enforce another way of fishing and to support and compensate fishers who fish in a way that would allow vaquita to survive,” says Francis Gulland, Commissioner at the US Marine Mammal Commission, who added that working to get buy-in from the community is a far more effective strategy than attempting to enforce top-down bans. It’s a lesson she hopes can be learned in time to spare other species, which could soon also be subject to precipitous decline. “We tend to not pay attention until we are in total crisis mode,” she says, noting that conservation efforts didn’t really start until there were just a few hundred vaquitas left. When the population fell further, advocates attempted to catch vaquitas to relocate them to protected areas, but the program was promptly stopped after it resulted in one vaquita’s death. “If there had been 10 thousand animals we would have time to learn what to do to improve the techniques,” Gulland said. “They could have been moved to a protected area but it was all too late.” There is still time to save the vaquita, she says, but not much. “If we can prevent them from being caught in nets,” she says, “they will survive.”",News/World news,The tiny vaquita porpoise now numbers less than 10.

2/12/2022,"A Black FedEx driver who was allegedly shot at by a white father and son in Mississippi while delivering packages said he “can definitely see the similarities” between his case and that of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man who was murdered in 2020 by three white men while jogging in Georgia. “Because Ahmaud Arbery didn’t survive to speak up for himself, so I want to take that upon myself to do that for me and him as well,” said D’Monterrio Gibson, 24, in an interview with CNN on Friday.  The father and son, Brandon and Gregory Case, were reportedly arrested and charged this week over the incident. According to Gibson, he was delivering packages on an evening route in Brookhaven, Mississippi, on 24 January when the two men allegedly chased him in a truck for several minutes and fired at least five shots towards his van. “They came out of nowhere,” he said at a news conference on Thursday. “Even if [the van] was unmarked, civilians still can’t take the law into their own hands … I’m thinking this is a racism thing,” he added. According to the Washington Post, Gregory Case was driving the pickup truck and attempted to cut Gibson off as he was trying to leave. Gibson then swerved around the truck to get out of the neighborhood. Gibson described the alleged attack in an interview with the Mississippi Free press. “I drive down about two or three houses,” Gibson said. “There’s another guy [Brandon Case] standing in the middle of the street pointing a gun at my windows and signaling me to stop with his hands, as well as mouthing the word, ‘Stop.’ I shake my head no, I hide behind the steering wheel, and I swerve around him as well. As I swerve around him, he starts firing shots into my vehicle.” He added that when he called the police to report the shootings, a dispatcher interrupted him and asked if he had been on Junior Trail, the street where he was delivering the packages. “I said, ‘Yes.’ He was like, ‘Well I just got a call of a suspicious person at this address,” Gibson recalled at Thursday’s press briefing. He replied to the dispatcher and said, “Sir, I’m not a suspicious person. I work for FedEx. I was just doing my job.” The Cases were arrested on 1 February, over a week after the incident. According to court records reviewed by the Washington Post, Brandon Case, 35, was charged with feloniously attempting to cause bodily harm with a firearm and a deadly weapon. His 58-year-old father, Gregory Case, was charged with unlawfully and feloniously conspiring to commit aggravated assault. The father and son were released from jail the next day on bail. Despite the charges, Gibson and his lawyers argue that the local police are not taking the case seriously and are calling for a federal hate crimes investigation. “Some semblance of justice was served, but we’re disappointed since we think the charges should be attempted murder because that’s what it was,” said Carlos E Moore, one of Gibson’s lawyers. Gibson said he was initially reluctant to speak out about the incident until he was reminded of Arbery’s murder – which also involved a white father and son - and similar incidents over the years in which Black people were killed while simply going about their lives. “I thought about all the people who ain’t here to speak [for themselves],” Gibson told reporters. “I’m just looking at everything way different now … You can just die doing your job.” The Cases and their attorneys have yet to comment publicly on the situation. In a statement to the Associated Press, FedEx condemned the incident, saying, “FedEx takes situations of this nature very seriously, and we are shocked by this criminal act against our team member. ... The safety of our team members is our top priority, and we remain focused on his wellbeing. We will continue to support Mr Gibson as we cooperate with investigating authorities.”",News/US news,Black FedEx driver shot at by white men draws parallels to Ahmaud Arbery case,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/11/dmonterrio-gibson-black-fedex-driver-shot-white-men-ahmaud-arbery
2/12/2022,"Matching extreme weather events to voting patterns has revealed that in Europe people who have experienced flooding, heatwaves and forest fires are more likely to vote green. This trend has developed over six European elections between 1994 and 2019, a period when climate change has gone from a theoretical threat to voters to many having experienced devastating events not previously seen in their lifetimes. The realisation that urgent action is needed for climate mitigation and adaptation has led voters to support green party candidates. Greens have done better wherever the calamities have been worst. The trend is more marked in the north and west of the EU where the climate is more moderate and colder, presumably because extremes have become more noticeable.  The researchers noted that the tendency to vote green was enhanced where the population was generally fairly affluent and economic conditions were good. When the economic conditions worsened, this factor again assumed greater importance in voting choices. The European elections are by proportional representation, so that minority parties, which the greens are in all of the 34 countries involved, will get some seats even if their overall vote is relatively small. Currently greens hold 69 seats out of 705 in the European parliament.",News/News,Europeans more likely to vote green after extreme weather events,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/12/europeans-more-likely-to-vote-green-after-extreme-weather-events

2/12/2022,"People in the Spanish region of Castilla y León vote on Sunday in a snap election that represents a massive gamble for the ruling conservative People’s party (PP). It could see a breakthrough by a new political platform campaigning on behalf of depopulated and underdeveloped parts of Spain. The vote was called in December after the regional president, the PP’s Alfonso Fernández Mañueco, kicked his partners in the centre-right Citizens party out of the coalition government, claiming that he could no longer rely on their loyalty.  It follows a turbulent few weeks in Spanish politics that have included a row over the country’s meat industry and rightwing fury after the socialist-led central government managed to get its flagship labour reforms approved by parliament thanks to a PP MP accidentally voting against his party. Buoyed by its performance in national polls – and by its strong result in the Madrid region last May – the PP had hoped to use the Castilla y León poll to win a majority there and to score an emphatic victory before a looming election in Andalucía and next year’s general election. But its momentum appears to be waning. Recent polls suggest that the party, led by Pablo Casado, will have to rely on the support of the far-right Vox party if it wants to remain in office. The socialists are predicted to finish not far behind the PP, with Vox in third place and Citizens – already a party in its death throes across Spain – coming a distant fourth. While the PP has already relied on Vox to govern in regions such as Madrid and Andalucía, relations between the two parties have been strained since October 2020, when Casado rounded on the far-right grouping, accusing it of practising a politics based on “fear, anger, resentment and revenge”. Since then, however, Casado has dragged his party rightwards and enthusiastically sought out culture wars and wedge issues. Both the PP and Vox have seized on comments that the consumer affairs minister, Alberto Garzón, made in an interview with the Guardian last December. Although the minister had renewed his calls for Spaniards to reduce their meat consumption for the sake of their health and the planet – and contrasted meat from traditional farming with meat from intensive megafarms – his words were twisted and presented as an attack on Spain’s meat industry. Standing in front of a field of cows on a traditional farm near the small town of Las Navas del Marqués in the Ávila province of Castilla y León last month, Casado said the government was “insulting livestock farmers, insulting the Mediterranean diet and threatening Spain’s international image”. He also said that megafarms were subject to strict legislation and that, as he saw it, “they don’t cause pollution”. Asked why some PP councils had campaigned to stop the construction of new megafarms, Casado said those were political decisions. In recent days, Casado has also accused the Spanish government of attacking the country’s cheeses, beets, and of spending “a million euros on tourism for other races”. Last week, he suggested that the socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, presided over a “Dracula coalition”, but went on to mix his metaphors by claiming that everyone Sánchez bit “turns into a zombie, like him”. With the PP’s fortunes in the traditionally conservative region suddenly in doubt, the party drafted in Isabel Díaz Ayuso, who is widely seen as a possible rival to Casado because of her electoral clout and ability to appeal to Vox voters. It did not take her long to stake her conservative credentials. Responding to questions about the sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests in Spain, Ayuso said, “All institutions make mistakes”, adding that few people wanted to talk about the church’s cultural legacy in Spain or about “the charity, solidarity, values and comfort it offered”. Pablo Simón, a political scientist at Madrid’s Carlos III University, said things in Castilla y León were not going according to plan for Casado and his party. “The problem is that when they called the elections, they thought they’d do so well that they’d be able to govern alone, like in Madrid,” he said. “But all the polls point at things getting worse for them than they’d thought.” Anything the PP do now, added Simón, will come at a cost: “They’ll either have to depend on Vox, with all that depending on a more radical parliamentary partner implies, or they could even lose the government. Either scenario is worse for the PP than how things were, or how they wanted them to be.” Simón also noted that the so-called España vaciada, or hollowed-out Spain platform, could play a role in the shape of the new regional parliament as “there are nine provinces that are very different with local phenomena”. Voters sick of 35 years of PP rule could decide to give their votes to these grassroots groups on Sunday. The people of Las Navas del Marqués, however, are not holding their breath for an imminent improvement in their daily lives. Javier, who owns a bar in the town, said locals were more worried about depopulation and basic services than the meat row. “It’s about all kinds of infrastructure, from telecoms and internet to roads,” he said. “There’s also a shortage of doctors.” Given that most of the meat in the area was raised on traditional farms, he added, few people would take issue with Garzón’s words. Miguel, who was born in a house on the main square in Las Navas del Marqués 74 years ago, didn’t hesitate when asked what the most pressing electoral issue was. “Jobs, jobs and jobs,” he said. “People go where the work is and that’s how towns die. A lot of people here have always felt left behind and abandoned by the authorities. Castilla y León needs to be thought about a bit more. It’s not just about Catalonia and the Basque country and Andalucía.”",News/World news,Culture wars rage as depopulated Spanish region goes to polls,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/12/culture-wars-rage-as-depopulated-spanish-region-goes-to-polls-castilla-y-leon

2/12/2022,"“Sat like a Cormorant,” Milton wrote of Satan in Paradise Lost, “devising death to them who lived.” I recall these lines now because the fisherman I met at this lovely country park was of similar mind. “If that’s a gun you’ve got,” he said, referring to my camera and monopod, “can you shoot them; they steal all my fish.” “Your fish?” I asked. Yet there was probably one point on which we agreed. Cormorants are better at catching fish than he is. The reservoir here is narrow but deep-watered and bound on both shores by steep-sided beech woods, which immerse the western half in a well of late afternoon winter shadow. Twelve cormorants, some of the southern race Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis, descended on to its silky green-black surface.  They worked as a pack, sending out patterns of sparkling spray and white-edged ripples across the water’s quaking plane. One after the other, birds made quick-fire dives. Each was a perfect lesson in instant line and ancient purpose. The head and neck were recurved but arrowed down in the exact split second that the heavy body was raised clear of the water to drag thick paddle-feet hard behind. It made of each bird an exquisite ellipse of sinew and muscle from beak to tail. Down they went. The submerged snake-lines were marked by slight swellings in the surface sheen. No dive was less than 30 seconds. Then up they thrust again, splitting the plate of closed water like a gutting knife. I’ve seen them hunt like this on Lake Prespa in Greece, where 300 sinensis cormorants will encircle a fishing party of pelicans. I’ve also watched them do it in Portugal, where herons and egrets become so excited by the frenzy of fish-catching that they plunge in themselves and surround the melee in short, awkward failed sorties. Then a signal seemed to go out. The fish were done. Twelve birds lumbered up, and by the time I’d sorted exposure, adjusted ISO and shutter speed, got focus and pulled the monopod to the correct length, there was a beautiful vision of silvery fractal patterns spreading from so many black feet as their owners flew away.
