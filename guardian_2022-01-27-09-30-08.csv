1/27/2022,"A match that offered fabulous entertainment, four marvellous individual innings, 31 sixes and several rewritten records ended with England posting the highest ever second-innings total at Kensington Oval but still losing by 20 runs to a West Indies side propelled to an unreachable total of 224-5 by Rovman Powell and Nicholas Pooran.  Tom Banton’s excellent 39-ball 73 kept England approximately on track to chase down their target, but unlike Pooran a little earlier he did not find a teammate to join him at the crease and help shoulder the burden. Neither Jason Roy nor James Vince could make it out of the teens, Moeen Ali posted his second duck of the series, and Liam Livingstone, playing only after convincing coaches on Tuesday that he had fully recovered from oesophagitis, was clearly unfit, and needed a physio to bring him some medication before he had even faced a ball. By his fifth, he was out. When Banton himself fell in the following over, picking out Jason Holder at long-on when trying to hit Kieron Pollard for successive sixes, England’s chances seem to dip as precipitously as had the ball. But Phil Salt, one of three England debutants, was superb in scoring 57 off 24 balls before he went in the final over, having kept England’s score soaring at enough of a pace for success to remain a plausible possibility until very nearly the end. After winning the toss as choosing, as they do, to bat second England hit upon a novel way, though perhaps not the most effective, to reduce attention on their leaky death bowling: to leak runs consistently throughout the innings. As a result, and thanks to some marvellous batting from Pooran and Powell – who both posted the highest T20 score of their careers – West Indies were able to set a new all-time record third-wicket partnership, more than 200 runs were scored for the first time in an international T20 at Kensington Oval, and the umpires must have very nearly run out of the antiseptic wipes they use to cleanse the ball of potential viral scraps every time it is returned from the stands. Including leg byes (one) and wides (one) 30 boundaries were registered in the hosts’ innings; only five overs were entirely boundary-free and 13 contained at least one six. It was a near-constant aerial barrage, Pooran scoring 70 off 43 and Powell 107 off 53 before both lifted catches to Liam Livingstone in the deep in the closing stages. This was hitting that was great in every sense, the overwhelming majority of West Indies’ 16 sixes not just clearing the rope but mortally endangering anyone sitting in Kensington Oval’s upper tiers who was not, for some reason, paying rapt attention. Powell was the one new face in West Indies’ side, replacing Odean Smith to incredible effect. Meanwhile England’s changes included three debuts: Harry Brook and George Garton joining Salt in making their first starts, Moeen deputised as captain after Eoin Morgan felt a muscle strainin the warm-up and Tom Banton took the glovesas Sam Billings returned to his traditional if unwanted drink-carrying role. The result of all this was England fielding three left-arm seamers, but it was a left-handed batter who first caught the eye, as Pooran took on his fellow southpaws and flourished. After Garton dismissed Brandon King in his first over, Pooran came in and immediately took control, and by the time Shai Hope, West Indies’ other opener, was dismissed Hope had four and Pooran was already on 32. But by then Pooran’s period as the outstanding batter was over. He continued to play beautifully but was instantly overshadowed by Powell. The 28-year-old slog-swept his second ball of the night for six and barely decelerated from there, his fluency such that Pooran was soon reduced to accepting singles just to get his teammate back on strike. There was one shot in particular that illustrated Powell’s timing, when he deflected a Reece Topley full toss way over the boundary for six while off balance and barely moving his bat at all. By the midway point of the 11th over both players had faced 27 balls, Pooran scoring 46 and Powell 45, and they continued to go stride for stride from there: Pooran took 34 balls to reach a half-century, Powell 31, and both were eventually caught in the deep by Livingstone, Pooran for a 43-ball 70 and Powell a superb 53-ball 107. As much as Banton and Salt peppered the stands thereafter, it was a standard England could not match.",Sport/Sport,Powell and Pooran blast West Indies to 21-run victory over England in third T20,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/27/powell-and-pooran-blast-west-indies-to-21-run-victory-over-england-in-third-t20
1/27/2022,"Black and Asian students won places at prestigious UK universities at record levels in 2021, alongside increasing numbers of students from all backgrounds, and the chief executive of the Ucas admissions service has said there could be one million applications for places by 2026. The number of Black students who accepted places at selective institutions, such as those in the Russell Group of leading research universities, rose by 19% in a year, from 3,775 in 2020 to just under 4,500, according to figures released by Ucas.  The record numbers of applications and acceptances were driven by the rise in higher A-levels awarded in 2021 after the government’s decision to cancel exams and replace them with teacher-assessed grades. Ucas said the number of applicants achieving the top A-level grades almost doubled compared with 2020 – up from 12,735 to 19,595 – and was nearly quadruple the pre-pandemic levels of 5,655 in 2019. “As a likely result, 103,010 UK young people were accepted at higher-tariff providers, up 11% from 92,650 in 2020,” it noted. The boost in results and rising numbers of 18-year-olds in the UK population saw more applicants awarded places across the board, with 492,005 students accepted on to a course. The proportion of school leavers seeking further study continued to rise, with 38% of 18-year-olds living in the UK going on to university – up by more than four percentage points compared with 2019’s figure. This suggests that the public’s appetite for higher education shows no sign of abating. Clare Marchant, the chief executive of Ucas, said: “This year sees the return to exams, and is the second year of what will be a decade of growth of 18-year-olds in the UK population. As we are set to hit one million applicants by 2026, it will be even more important that the higher education admissions system meets the needs of students in this increasingly competitive environment.” The data also showed that nearly 21% of students receiving free school meals were accepted on to a university or college course last year. Ucas said this was the highest rate on record. Kevin Gilmartin, the post-16 specialist at the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “We are delighted to see the increase in the numbers of students being accepted at university, including a welcome rise in those from disadvantaged backgrounds. “The increases have come despite the whole application cycle taking place during the pandemic, reflecting the tremendous efforts made by school and college leaders and their staff in guiding students through the process.” However, applicants from more privileged backgrounds continued to apply and gain places at even higher rates than in previous years. The number of applicants from the wealthiest backgrounds increased by 15%, while those from poorer areas rose more slowly, by 10%. The proportion of white students gaining places at higher-tariff universities also rose steeply, up by 12.5% to nearly 75,600. Partly as a result, the gap in participation rates between disadvantaged pupils and their peers continued to widen. In 2012, the difference between the number of acceptances for students on free school meals and those who weren’t stood at 14.5 percentage points. But last year this had risen to more than 20 percentage points. This year’s students could see further strike disruption on campus, after a proposal by the University and College Union to reevaluate the pension scheme at the heart of one dispute was rejected by employers. Universities UK dismissed the proposal, saying it “does not appear to be a serious attempt to reach agreement”.",News/Education,Record number of Black and Asian students accepted at top UK universities,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/27/record-number-of-black-and-asian-students-accepted-at-top-uk-universities
1/27/2022,"Private rents in Britain are rising at their fastest rate on record, piling more pressure on households feeling the strain of the cost of living crisis. The average advertised rent outside London is 9.9% higher than a year ago as tenants making plans for a post-pandemic life jostle for properties, according to the website Rightmove.  Meanwhile, London rents have hit a new record and are higher now than before the start of the pandemic after a bounceback in demand fuelled by the gradual return to the workplace and more overseas students looking for a place to live. The average advertised asking rent outside London is £1,068 a calendar month, said Rightmove. In London it is £2,142. The increases have been attributed to a mismatch between the number of tenants looking for a place and the stock of available properties. Tenant demand is 32% higher than this time last year, but the number of available properties is 51% lower, said the website. “The imbalance between high tenant demand and low rental stock is supporting asking rent rises, and has led to competition between tenants for the rental properties available nearly doubling compared to the same period last year,” said a spokesperson. During the pandemic some tenants have quit London and other big cities after re-evaluating their lifestyle and deciding they want to live in the suburbs or the countryside, or somewhere with more open space. Rightmove named a number of “rental hotspots” that had seen typical rents increase by between 14% and 20% in a year. They include three Kent coastal towns – Ramsgate, Chatham and Folkestone – and locations such as Ascot in Berkshire and Bridgwater in Somerset. The website is predicting a further 5% increase in average asking rents this year. Separate research found that some landlords were increasing rents “to cover the increased tax burden” they faced. During the last few years many amateur landlords who were attracted by the buy-to-let boom have quit the market owing to regulatory and tax changes that have in some cases hit profits. One in four landlords have raised rents in response to tax changes that were phased in between 2017 and 2020, according to research from the Landlord Works, a platform run by the Nationwide building society.",Lifestyle/Money,Private rents in Britain rise at fastest rate on record ,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/27/private-rents-in-britain-rise-at-fastest-rate-on-record
1/27/2022,"Ministers have thrown further support behind EDF Energy’s £20bn Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk with a £100m investment to help develop the project while the company courts private investors. The government’s cash injection is designed to “maximise investor confidence” in the project while French state-owned EDF works towards setting out a funding plan which satisfies investors and UK ministers.  In return the government will have rights to an equity stake in the development company behind the project and over the land on which EDF plans to build it. If EDF is able to secure enough investor backing to make a final investment decision on Sizewell it would reimburse the government with a stake in the project or in cash. The UK government reignited talks with EDF over the nuclear project in late 2020, focusing on whether the company could prove it had learned lessons from its Hinkley Point nuclear project in Somerset, and that a successor plant would offer the public value for money. EDF has since embarked on a hunt for investors to help to drive down the cost for bill-payers. It is understood that EDF and the UK government also hope to secure enough new investment to replace Chinese state-controlled CGN, which has a 20% stake in the critical national infrastructure project. Sizewell, which is still going through planning and development, would power 6 million homes, but has been plagued by opposition from local campaigners, fears over its price tag and China’s involvement. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business and energy secretary, said the government’s funding would add support to the development of Sizewell C “during this important phase of negotiations as we seek to maximise investor confidence in this nationally significant project”. “In light of high global gas prices, we need to ensure Britain’s future energy supply is bolstered by reliable, affordable, low carbon power that is generated in this country,” he said. “New nuclear is not only an important part of our plans to ensure greater energy independence, but to create high-quality jobs and drive economic growth.” The fresh support has emerged months after the government put forward legislation to create a new funding model to help the project attract investment at a lower cost than the Hinkley Point C project which could add between £10 and £15 a year to the average energy bill for 35 years, making it one of the most expensive energy projects undertaken. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, described the funding as “another big step forward for Sizewell C and a big vote of confidence” which “sends a clear signal from government to investors that it sees projects like Sizewell C as essential to our clean energy transition”. Simone Rossi, the chief executive of EDF Energy, said the company is pleased that the government is “showing its confidence in Sizewell C” which would “allow us to continue to move the project towards a financial investment decision”. Rossi claimed that Sizewell C, if approved, would lower energy costs for consumers and help to insulate the UK from global gas prices while providing a “huge economic boost to east Suffolk” and “bring new opportunities for thousands of nuclear supply chain companies up and down the country”. Alison Downes, from Suffolk campaign group Stop Sizewell C, said: “We fail to understand why the UK is bailing out crisis-hit EDF, and why the government is so committed to poor value large scale nuclear when there are other, better options.” EDF’s share price has slumped by almost half in the last three years to about €8.28 a share as technical trouble within its global nuclear fleet has caused its costs to spiral. It warned investors earlier this month that its French nuclear reactors would produce 10% less electricity than expected this year. Separately, the French government expects the company to take an €8.4bn (£7bn) financial hit to protect households from rocketing energy costs by limiting bill hikes to 4% this year.",News/Environment,Ministers invest £100m in EDF’s £20bn Sizewell C nuclear power station,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/27/ministers-invest-100m-in-edfs-20bn-sizewell-c-nuclear-power-station
1/27/2022,"MPs have expressed “deep concern” over the leaking of price-sensitive information before Rishi Sunak’s budget last year and warned the chancellor his package of measures risked adding to Britain’s already surging inflation rate. The influential all-party Treasury committee called for Sunak to investigate how details of a planned increase in the national living wage to £9.50 an hour were disclosed in the runup to the budget in late October.  “We are deeply concerned that the rate of the national living wage was disclosed to ITV in an unauthorised fashion prior to the budget, and we agree with the Treasury that this could have caused confusion in the market as to whether the information was accurate,” the MPs said. “Given the potential opportunity for disruption that this unauthorised leak could have caused, the government should investigate how this policy came to be leaked prior to the budget and should publicise its findings.” Tom Scholar, the permanent secretary to the Treasury, wrote to the committee saying he did not believe the wage hike announcement for workers aged over 25 constituted market-sensitive information because it was an “economy-wide measure”. However, the committee said it believed the announcement could be seen as market sensitive because it affected certain companies with high numbers of low-paid workers compared with other businesses. Publishing its report on Sunak’s combined budget and spending review, the MPs said the chancellor’s decisions – including the planned increase in national insurance contributions – would add to inflationary pressure and make it harder to cut taxes before the next election. Mel Stride, the committee’s chairman, said: “With inflation rising significantly, concerns about pressure on the cost of living are growing. While the prime minister’s ambition to promote high wage growth is worthy, focusing on increasing wages without improving productivity is likely to be inflationary, and risks contributing to a wage price spiral.” Increases in NI and corporation tax, together with the freezing of income tax personal allowances, will leave taxes as a share of national income at their highest in 70 years, but Stride said the scope for reducing them might be limited. “The chancellor has stated his ambition to cut taxes before the end of the parliament. In October, there was little room for manoeuvre, but there has been positive news from the public finances since then. While further good news may help him achieve this ambition, significant risks remain, most notably from the impact of inflation.” The MPs also questioned Sunak’s decision to offer less generous post-Brexit support to the UK’s struggling regions than had been provided by the EU. Noting the government’s shared prosperity fund would provide 60% of the funding from EU structural investment funds, the report said: “If the new fund is intended to be one of “the centrepieces” of the government’s ambition, it is surprising that the size of the fund is being reduced to such an extent. The government will need to demonstrate how these reduced funds will achieve their defined metrics for levelling up.” A Treasury spokesperson said:“The budget and spending review set out a plan to create a stronger economy for the British people. “It balanced delivering on the people’s priorities with keeping the public finances on a sustainable path, ensuring future generations aren’t burdened by even higher debt.”",News/UK news,MPs raise concerns about leak of hike in living wage in last budget,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/27/mps-raise-concerns-about-leak-of-hike-in-living-wage-in-last-budget
1/27/2022,"Asum of £100m is peanuts in the expensive world of nuclear power stations, so regard the business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng’s funding for a round of development work on Sizewell C as a form of advertising. The cash is intended to send a message that the government is serious about getting the plant built in Suffolk. And it is an appeal for outside investors to volunteer to sit alongside developer EDF, the French state-backed group. There was also a definition of a desirable investor: “British pension funds, insurers and other institutional investors from like-minded countries”. Note the nationality test. It is the closest we have come to official confirmation that China General Nuclear (CGN), originally slated for a 20% stake in Sizewell, will be kicked off the project. It remains to be seen how, legally, the government will rip up the 2015 deal with CGN signed by David Cameron’s government, but the intention is clear.  So, too, is the intended funding mechanism. It will be a regulated asset base (RAB) model, a version of the formula used at Heathrow Terminal 5 and the Thames Tideway giant sewer. The key point for investors is that they will see some income before Sizewell is built, unlike at Hinkley Point C where EDF and CGN earn their princely cashflows only when the electricity starts to flow. The switch will lower Sizewell’s lifetime costs by “more than £30bn” versus Hinkley’s contracts-for-difference model, says the government, being economical with the economics. What it doesn’t mention is that any cost overrun (a real risk given nuclear’s reliable record of never hitting its construction budgets) will be shoved on to consumers, who will in any case see £10 a year added to household energy bills during the build phase. But, yes, Kwarteng is correct that the RAB model is the only one with a chance of attracting new investors. What, though, if those British and like-minded institutions still refuse to play? Nuclear represents unknown territory for most of them. What if competition to invest, which is meant to be the other way in which RAB lowers financing costs, doesn’t materialise? What’s the government’s plan B? The only possible solution is for the state to invest directly. If that is so, wouldn’t it be better to run an upfront benchmarking exercise at the outset to compare the numbers? Sizewell, unfortunately, is probably inevitable given the current panic over high gas prices and long-term energy security. But taxpayers, on the hook anyway via household bills, deserve to know that the odd billion or three isn’t being diverted unnecessarily to intermediaries. By the time Sizewell’s sums become enormous, transparency will be essential. The government has just thrown £1.7bn at Bulb, the failed energy supplier, to keep it on life support and it will be a miracle if all the cash comes back in full. In that context, using public money to invest in a productive energy asset doesn’t seem such an awful prospect. Theodore Agnew’s dramatic resignation as counter-fraud minister this week has stung Rishi Sunak. So it should. “A combination of arrogance, indolence and ignorance freezes the government machine” in dealing with Covid fraud, said the outgoing minster, which is a heavy charge. Cue a series of tweets from the chancellor on Wednesday about how he is not ignoring or “writing off” the problem. In one respect, one can sympathise with Sunak. In the early stage of the pandemic, it was indeed important to get money out of the door quickly to small businesses. Some level of fraud was inevitable. Perfection was impossible. The question posed by Lord Agnew, though, is different. Is the government chasing the fraudsters as hard as it could? It was also the challenge set by the National Audit Office last month when it reviewed the £47bn bounceback loan scheme, which is estimated by the business department to have generated £4.9bn of fraudulent loans. The NAO’s advice was clear: the government should produce a formal strategy for managing bounceback loan fraud; it should set targets for success; it should report on the performance of each counter-fraud measure; it should assess resources regularly. In short, inject professionalism and accountability into the process. Is the £100m that Sunak said has been invested into the taxpayer protection taskforce enough? It is hard to tell until the government sets public targets for how much could be recouped. Until then, the suspicion will remain that fraud levels are, as Agnew put it, “a multiple of what should be happening”.",News/Business,What’s plan B if the government can’t attract investors willing to fund Sizewell C? | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/jan/27/whats-plan-b-if-the-government-cant-attract-investors-willing-to-fund-sizewell-c
1/27/2022,"Unemployed workers will be forced to take up a job in any sector or face swift financial sanctions under a crackdown designed to fill hundreds of thousands of vacancies in sectors from social care to construction, ministers have announced. Claimants will be given just four weeks – down from three months – to find a job within their preferred sector. After that point, if they fail to make “reasonable efforts” to secure a job or turn down any offer, they will have part of their universal credit payment withdrawn under a tightening of existing Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) policy.  The move, which is part of an initiative to get 500,000 people into work by June and fill 1.2m job vacancies nationally, comes as Boris Johnson seeks to reassert control over the political agenda amid the “partygate” crisis. The Way to Work campaign was flagged up by an embattled Johnson at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday as evidence that the government was focused on the Covid recovery – leading to opposition claims that it was an attempt to distract from his political woes. Labour’s Alison McGovern, the shadow employment minister, said: “This announcement has more to do with trying to save the prime minister’s job than supporting people into work. It’s just tinkering at the edges – long-term unemployment is 60% higher than before the pandemic.” Cracking down on the unemployed has long been regarded as popular with many voters, although welfare experts said that any rise in levels of benefit sanctions could backfire as low-income families struggle with the cost of living crisis. Currently work-ready unemployment benefit claimants have three months to find a job in their preferred sector – typically their area of expertise – before sanctions are threatened. The new rules mean sanctions could be imposed four weeks after they make their initial claim for universal credit – in theory, even before they receive their first benefit payment. The move is the most eye-catching part of a newly launched employment campaign. This also promises more tailored support from, and face-to-face time with, job coaches to help claimants find work. “Helping people get any job now means they can get a better job and progress into a career,” the work and pensions secretary, Thérèse Coffey, said. “Way to Work is a step-change in our offer to claimants and employers, making sure our jobcentre network and excellent work coaches can deliver opportunities, jobs and prosperity to all areas of the country. “As we emerge from Covid, we are going to tackle supply challenges and support the continued economic recovery by getting people into work. Our new approach will help claimants get back into the world of work quickly, while helping ensure that employers get the people they and the economy need.” However, welfare experts said the tightening of benefit sanctions would be counterproductive and could force people into worse jobs and damage careers. They said ministers were out of touch with the realities of life on a low income and ignored the evidence about how best to get people into secure, decently paid work. “Pushing people to apply for any job regardless of its suitability, underpinned by the very real threat of benefit sanctions, is corrosive to relationships between claimants and advisers, and risks pushing people into insecure and unsuitable employment,” said Ruth Patrick, a senior lecturer in social policy at the University of York. “This is not a way to work, it is a way to policy failure. The government is right that people need and deserve good jobs, but these will not be delivered by compelling people to seek any work, and against a context of continuing in-work poverty.” The UK’s foremost academic expert on benefit sanctions, David Webster, said that governments often tightened punishments for jobseekers when they were worried about apparently slow uptake of jobs after a recession. But there was no serious evidence that sanctions had ever got more people into work. “It is simply wasteful to force people quickly into roles that can lead to bad job matches, and push people into worse jobs, often with lasting ill-effects for their career and earning prospects. You can’t force square pegs into round holes,” the University of Glasgow research fellow said. The government’s spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, found no evidence that benefit sanctions work, and concluded that they were as likely to force people to stop claiming benefits without getting a job as they were to get them into employment. The last big sanctions drive occurred between 2010 and 2016 when, at its height, 1 million people a year were sanctioned, leading to widespread poverty and hardship. This was subsequently eased, and sanctions were temporarily suspended under the first lockdown, but in recent months sanctions levels have crept up again.",News/Society,Universal credit claimants face tough sanctions in UK job crackdown,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/27/universal-credit-claimants-face-tough-sanctions-in-uk-job-crackdown
1/27/2022,"The lowest number of cars rolled out of British factories last year since 1956, as the industry warned that rising energy costs and further shortages of computer chips will plague its recovery. Car production slumped across the UK and the world in 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic swept across the globe, but many in the industry had expected a rapid improvement. Instead, the disruption triggered a global shortage of semiconductor chips, leading to an even worse 2021.  Total UK car production fell by 6.7% to just under 860,000, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the industry lobby group. Its chief executive, Mike Hawes, described it as “a dismal year”, with output down by more than a third on 2019. Jaguar Land Rover’s output for the year fell by a 10th compared with the year before, but the carmaker managed to regain its title as the UK’s largest manufacturer, after briefly losing out to Nissan in 2020. Hawes said the industry had managed to cope with the extra costs of Brexit, although he added that executives were watching recent delays at the Dover Channel crossing. However, Hawes warned that energy price increases that have also hit households were set to add further to UK carmakers’ difficulties. He said the industry urgently needed “measures to mitigate the escalating energy costs which are threatening viability,” and warned that higher costs could feed through to higher prices. Factories are braced for price increases of up to 70% when old contracts expire. Energy is generally carmakers’ third-highest cost, after materials and labour, but the sector is lobbying to be designated as an energy-intensive industry in order to qualify for extra government support. Nevertheless, Hawes said the industry was approaching 2022 with “a lot more optimism”, particularly as the supply of semiconductors rises to meet demand after earlier investments by chip manufacturers. He said he expected the industry to return to 1m cars produced annually on a consistent basis – although he added that a return to the more than 1.7m cars built in 2016, the year of the Brexit referendum, was unlikely without new manufacturers choosing the UK. The SMMT did highlight £4.9bn in investment announced during the year by the automotive industry – although that included the speculative announcement of £2.5bn by Coventry council in a battery factory project that is yet to attract a lead investor. The number of battery electric cars with zero exhaust carbon emissions produced in the UK rose by 72% during 2021, but it remains only a 12th of overall UK output. The UK’s van industry performed considerably better than passenger car makers, with production up 24% on 2020 and up 3% compared with 2019. Hawes said the online shopping delivery boom had contributed to “extraordinarily high demand” for vans.",News/Business,UK car production slumps to lowest level since 1956,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/27/uk-car-production-slumps-to-lowest-level-since-1956
1/27/2022,"Global oil prices have climbed to $90 a barrel, which could tempt investors to pile more cash into long-term fossil fuel projects, dashing the world’s hopes to limit carbon emissions in line with climate targets and wasting billions in investment, according to a report. Recent price rises could mean more potential projects appear to be lucrative investments in the short-term, the report by the financial thinktank Carbon Tracker says. But the analysis suggests demand for fossil fuels could begin to dwindle by the time these projects begin, creating “a nightmare scenario” for investors and climate campaigners.  Demand for oil and gas has rebounded strongly as the global economy bounces back from the economic slowdown triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, leading to a global gas supply crunch and rocketing energy market prices. The international oil price climbed from lows of about $20 a barrel in April 2020 to seven-year highs of $90 a barrel on Wednesday, and may reach $100 by the end of the year. Meanwhile gas prices have reached all-time highs in markets across Europe and Asia, fuelling a cost of living crisis. But the increase was unlikely to last over the lifetime of a long-term fossil fuel investment, Carbon Tracker said, because government climate commitments combined with the rapid switch to electric vehicles and renewable energy would drive down demand for oil sharply from the late 2020s to 2040. “You can see the same over-investment story for gas,” said Mike Coffin, the head of oil and gas at Carbon Tracker and a co-author of the report. He advised oil and gas companies and their investors to “resist the temptation” to make long-term investments in new fossil fuel projects based on current market prices. Axel Dalman, a Carbon Tracker analyst and the lead author of the report, said: “Companies may see high prices as a huge neon sign pointing towards investment in more supply. However, this could become a nightmare scenario if they go ahead with projects which deliver oil around the time that demand stars to decline.” A failure to acknowledge “the sea change risks” facing fossil fuel developers from the global transition to low-carbon energy risked locking in carbon emissions, which would dash the Paris climate goals as well as investor returns, Coffin added. The warning follows a call this week from Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, for governments to triple their investment in low-carbon energy sources over the next decade to cut their reliance on gas as a safeguard against a future energy market crisis. “The world has not been investing enough to meet its future energy needs – and that remains the case today. Clean energy investment is gradually picking up but remains far short of what is required to meet rising demand for energy services in a sustainable way,” he added.",News/Business,"Rocketing demand for fossil fuels could deal blow to climate goals, report says",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/27/demand-fossil-fuels-climate-goals-oil-gas-prices-investors
1/27/2022,"In New Zealand’s biggest city, the streets were calm. At an Auckland supermarket, shelves of toilet paper, wine, chocolate and flour – metrics of a population hunkering down for a marathon of self-soothing and banana bread – had been quietly restocked from any panic-buying flurries. In an uptown cafe, a barista said things had been a little quieter since the announcement. Then again, she shrugged: “It might just be a Tuesday.” At Unity Books, a bookstore at the heart of the city, people were quietly browsing. “There’s always an element of eerie calm before the storm,” said bookseller Briary Lawry.  For a country on red alert thanks to the arrival of Omicron, one of the most startling elements of the week was its sense of normality. It followed one of the most significant turning points of New Zealand’s pandemic: a Sunday morning announcement that the new, highly contagious Omicron variant had breached the borders, and the country had likely reached the end of its time keeping Covid-19 on a very tight leash. By Wednesday, Omicron cases had cropped up in three cities and officials were publicly outlining plans for when case numbers passed 1,000 a day – a rate they expect will arrive shortly. Across the country, some did stocktakes of their cupboards and mask supplies. “As ever, New Zealand copes with worry by mass shopping,” remarked Jo Wilding, an Auckland teacher. “I’m pretty sure there is a thriving black market in brown sugar and noodles.” “We won’t stop Omicron, but we can try and slow it down,” prime minister Jacinda Ardern said last week. But the virus’s spread at home will mark a fundamental shift in New Zealand’s pandemic experience, and a strange new era of falling back into step with the experience of other countries, after years of treading a markedly different path. For almost two years, New Zealanders have looked on as other countries reeled from the spread of Covid, watching successive waves of infection, illness and rising death tolls. Intermittent lockdowns and strict border controls mean New Zealanders experienced Covid primarily in the abstract, at arm’s length. The country’s challenges and sacrifices have been real: long lockdowns, families separated by borders. But for most, the disease itself was experienced through a filter of news headlines and government updates, rather than watching as friends, family and colleagues got sick or died. “A large chunk of the population still doesn’t know anybody who has ever had Covid, and views it as something happening to other countries through the distance of a television screen,” political editor Jo Moir wrote on Monday. “A big culture shock is coming New Zealand’s way.” Having invested a huge amount of effort in maintaining Covid-zero while the country got vaccinated, New Zealanders must now reorient towards a world where cases are a daily reality. For many, that prospect is heavy with anxiety. “Frankly, I am very worried,” said Andy Black, 65, a gardener and landscape worker in the Hawkes Bay. “Although we have been living with this probability for nearly two years, we somehow hoped that it would pass us by.” “I’m scared,” said Trudi Mcalees, a veterinarian in the Waikato. “As a country we have forgotten how terrifying it was to see the pandemic unfold in Europe and America – the refrigerated containers being lined up to take the dead in New York less than two years ago. We have forgotten just how bloody lucky we have been.” “This is new territory for Kiwis,” said Tim Mora, 58, a priest and local body councillor in Greymouth. “Up until now we have managed to keep Covid in check with some initial rigorous measures – and right now despite a few inconveniences around managing it, life feels pretty normal. However, with the emergence of a few Omicron cases it feels like we are on the brink of experiencing what the rest of the world has dealt with for a while.” For New Zealanders, the change in circumstance requires a precipitous psychological shift, says clinical psychiatrist and disaster psychology specialist Dr Sarb Johal. “We’re making a leap from being safe in a relatively fixed and un-fluid environment, where we were relatively certain about what was going on,” he said. “That changed a few days ago, and now we are trying to remain safe in an uncertain environment. For a lot of people, it’s going to feel a little bit like being shot back into the early days of the pandemic, when we were watching it go around the world, and we’re expecting it to hit our shores.” Some, like Deborah McCabe in Auckland, thought a little longingly of the clearer rules and more stringent measures of New Zealand’s recent past. “I’d like to see things stricter here,” she said – perhaps something more akin to the level-3 lockdowns of last year. “I’m hoping things go well for Aotearoa, but I’m not sure at this point if we’re doing the right thing. Time will tell.” The anxiety that accompanies rising case numbers might be disproportionate to the risk New Zealanders face, Johal said. With close to 95% of adults fully vaccinated, many New Zealanders now had a small chance of getting seriously ill. “Our reactions might actually be not so much a reaction to the case numbers but [the shattering of] the norm,” he added. “In our day-to-day life, we ‘anchor’ ourselves to what a norm might be – often that’s kind of like a cognitive shortcut, and we expect everything in the world to behave in accordance with that norm,” he said. In New Zealand, extremely low daily case numbers have become an anchor for many: a simple signal that the government’s approach worked, and life remained essentially under control. In the coming weeks, New Zealanders can expect to be cut loose from that – daily cases will no longer be considered a metric of success. Johal was expecting to see “really big anxiety responses as you start seeing the numbers go up – because you’re perceiving it as a very abnormal threat that has suddenly popped up in your environment”. Eventually, New Zealanders would find new anchors, he said. Things would be easier. “What we need to continue to prepare ourselves for is continued change and continued surprises,” Johal said. “At lots of different points during this we label things, we want them to be static. So we say things like ‘the new normal’ – or we just want certainty. The temptation here is to say: this is how it’s going to be. But nobody knows.” For others, Omicron was met with more of a shrug. Some of those double-vaccinated felt they had done all they could, and it was time to march on. “This has a feeling of inevitability about it,” said Fiona, of Wellington. “In some ways it feels like a relief to have the waiting over with.” For others – particularly those based overseas – Omicron’s spread to New Zealand may have silver linings. About 1 million New Zealanders live overseas – as a portion of population, it has the second-highest diaspora of the OECD. For many of them and their families, the pandemic has meant years of concrete losses – constant precarity, funerals and births missed, families separated – as well as more amorphous grief: the sense of being locked out of home by a sometimes indifferent-seeming population. If Omicron spreads as expected, the country’s border restrictions will start to become redundant. “As a NZer who’s effectively been locked out of my country since 2020, thanks to closed borders and a lottery system for managed isolation facilities, the spread of Omicron brings mixed feelings,” said Joanna, a New Zealander based with a marketing firm in London. “To be clear, I don’t want anyone to get ill. But I do want the NZ government to wake up to the hardship and despair they’ve caused thousands and thousands of New Zealanders at being locked out – and locked in – without any ability to make choices for themselves about being with family members.” “I know Omicron will create distress and even tragedy for some of us,” said Joshua, a Whakatane student, “but, honestly, I was relieved when I heard it finally slipped through the border. The alternative was New Zealand being one of the last places on Earth to be stuck with Delta. Watching the less severe Omicron displace Delta around the world, it was hard not to feel trapped.”",News/World news,The new normal: New Zealand braces for shift from Covid zero to Covid acceptance,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/27/the-new-normal-new-zealand-braces-for-shift-from-covid-zero-to-covid-acceptance

If you’d rather be reading the news as it breaks, please head on over to our live blog, and if you just want to hear from Amy Remeikis after her absolutely scorching interview on The Project, I cannot blame you and here she is.  Now, on to the reads, which in truth are not 100% fun. To make up for that, here is a very old fish who loves belly rubs. In an analysis piece, diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour has contextualised the west’s mixed response to the Russia-Ukraine crisis. It is part of a deep fissure going back decades about what Germany and France, as opposed to the Anglosphere, regard as the best way to handle Russia, Wintour writes. Notable quote: “The central player in Europe’s relations with Russia is Germany, as it has been since unification,” Wintour writes. “Quite why Germany takes such a stubbornly forgiving or optimistic approach to Putin fills libraries.” How long will it take me to read? Two and a half minutes if you speed read it, but I recommend taking your time. But what’s happening right now? You can follow the latest news on the crisis here. Sign up to receive Five Great Reads as an email Science journalist Catherine Price has written a book arguing we underestimate the power of fun. Deep in the doldrums, Elle Hunt puts Price’s hypothesis to the test. How it started: In the month she set out to have more fun, Hunt’s Christmas and new year plans were derailed by Covid. “I am relieved of half my savings by a phone scammer; and a man I’m meeting for a first date suggests that maybe I am depressed.” How it’s going: Even after a few weeks of small-scale experiments with fun, Hunt was struck by how soon it started to feel more natural and easy. “And I am perturbed to realise how much of the resistance was within me all along.” How long will it take me to read? Four and a half minutes, each one of them a “micro dose” of joy. Bonus read: Speaking of making room for joy – why not delete social media apps from your phone? In this interview, masterful portrait photographer Anton Corbijn speaks about what it was like shooting frames of David Bowie, Miles Davis and Naomi Campbell. Notable quote: “This is one of my favourite photographs. It’s not just a shot of Bowie, it’s a Christ-like thing. That’s what you hope for when you take photographs: that it transcends all the usual stuff.” How long will it take me to read? Three minutes, but you’ll spend longer looking at the pictures. Working from your parents’ place might sound like a bold move, but for Kelly Eng it’s paying dividends, particularly for her children. Big aww moment: “I know how lucky I am. The devotion and patience my parents show their grandchildren is legendary, and I salute them and all the grandparents who have stepped up to help their families get through this time.” How long will it take me to read? Just a feel-good minute or two. Yellowjackets, a comedy-thriller about a girls’ soccer team stuck in the woods, has inspired obsessive devotion – and fan theorising. Here, one of the breakout stars, Australian actor Liv Hewson, talks through how it feels to gain an overnight cult following. Behind-the-scenes goss: Patrick Lenton writes that the cast have their own group chat, where they share the best Yellowjackets memes and theories that they find. “A lot of the time, I think the audience has similar questions to us,” Hewson tells him. “Which is really funny because when the scripts were being given to us, we didn’t necessarily know what was going to happen either.” How long will it take me to read? Two minutes, but if you haven’t watched Yellowjackets, more like 10 hours and two minutes – you should really see the series first.",News/Australia news,"Five Great Reads: why the west is split on Russia, Liv Hewson’s fan club, a fun experiment",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/27/five-great-reads-why-the-west-is-split-on-russia-liv-hewsons-fan-club-a-fun-experiment
