1/7/2022,"Prison is a ripe setting for drama, as one of last year’s finest series, Time, proved, but does it suit comedy quite so well? It has been a long time since the days of Porridge, but Screw (Channel 4) is banking on viewers seeing the funny side, promising a comedy-drama that offers more than the familiar misery. There isn’t that much humour in this opening episode, bar the odd witty line or two, though I suspect that when the comedy does come, it will be more on the dry side than characters slipping on contraband banana skins. Instead, it settles somewhere between soap and Sunday night blockbuster, and I mean that as a compliment. This is broad and warm and welcoming, with enough of a sharp side to make it worth sticking with. Nina Sosanya is Leigh Henry, an officer so dedicated to her job on Long Marsh Prison’s male C-wing that she appears to be secretly living there, in a cell she keeps free for that very purpose. It’s her story, at least to start with. She has spent more of her life working in the prison than out of it, she explains, as she campaigns for a promotion to custodial manager, a role that will allow her to make real change. She’s the officer who cares. The twist is that if she doesn’t get the job, her current position becomes redundant. The stakes are high. All she needs is one slow, boring, normal day on the job to prove she can manage it.  But what would a prison drama be, half comedy or not, if its days were slow, boring and normal? As soon as the first inmate strips off and runs down the stairs, chaos is set in motion. Leigh is the kind of officer for whom even the inmates have begrudging respect. She is kind to them, listens to them, and instinctively knows when it’s best to defuse a situation with humour, rather than a baton. But her underlings are not all on board with her maternal approach. Stephen Wight is Gary Campbell, a weasel who insists that the prisoners brought it all on themselves, spends most of his time moaning about the pay, thinks men’s prisons should be staffed by men only and is the walking, breathing embodiment of the phrase, “It’s PC gone mad.” He prefers to keep the inmates at arm’s length and does the bare minimum required. Judging by the state of things, it’s hard to blame him entirely. Money is tight, staffing is tighter, and everything is run on a knife’s edge. If an officer doesn’t turn up for work, the prisoners are kept in their cells, because there aren’t enough staff to safely look after them. The detail throughout is strong, from a contraband kettle to cook in – because the other is for coffee – to an underground trade in meals, with fish having the most value, closely followed by chicken. Creator Rob Williams (who also wrote BBC One’s excellent The Victim, aired in 2019) taught in prisons before becoming a screenwriter, and he gives his show the feel of an insider’s perspective, keeping an attentive eye on the frustrations of the staff and inmates. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the arrival of Rose Gill (Derry Girls’ Jamie-Lee O’Donnell, with a Manc-ish accent here, making a smooth transition to a more serious role), a new recruit who has done most of her preparation for the job via online courses. She arrives on the wing to a greeting of “welcome to hell”, and while she isn’t quite seeing the gnarly ultraviolence of a show like Oz, let’s say – this is a category B prison – she is clearly out of her depth, thrown into the work without so much as a tour of the coffee-making facilities. She gets it wrong when she tries to get it right, so she tries another approach – and gets it wrong again. Leigh is cold and unimpressed, resistant to helping a trainee who is likely to quit within two years, as we are told most of them do. Yet one of the prisoners seems to recognise Rose, and her flustered first day on the job becomes more and more suspicious. Why has she ended up there? There are more mysteries to unravel, some that remain within the episode, some that should last the series. One inmate seems to recognise a new face on the wing, which sends him into a spin and shows that Screw can do sensitive, too, while Leigh is certainly hiding some bigger secrets than where she is sleeping at night. It’s all very empathic, and though the show is told from the perspective of the officers, it is clearly a gentle plea to see everyone as human, no matter how they ended up where they did.",Arts/Television & radio,"Screw review – a warm, witty welcome to hell!

1/7/2022,"Last season’s losing Premiership semi-finalists lock horns on Friday night with both sides still trying to rediscover their spark. Bristol are 12th in the table, Sale just three places higher, and while Harlequins demonstrated last term that the play-offs should not yet be counted out for either team, the new year cannot bring about a change in fortunes quickly enough. Granted, Sale won their last match – against injury-hit Wasps – but consistency has been a chronic problem for a side who have not been able to string two wins together, having been widely tipped to continue their upward trajectory in Alex Sanderson’s first full season in charge. Bristol, meanwhile, got off to a bad start, initially suggesting that last term’s semi-final defeat by Harlequins was not entirely out of the system. Increasingly, however, they have looked a busted flush, even if scorelines have improved in narrow defeats by Leicester and Exeter in recent weeks.  The reasons for each side’s decline are myriad and Bath’s plight demonstrates just how hard it is to get out of a Premiership rut at the moment. To name a few, Bristol seem to have been hit harder than most by the effects of a reduced salary cap while Sale have struggled to cope without their influential scrum-half Faf de Klerk, and each side has been hit by Covid disruption, either domestically or in Europe. Listen to Sanderson and his opposite number, Pat Lam, this week and they insist they are still enjoying the challenge, even if they sound a little weary, but both articulate the hurdles to overcome in different ways. Lam is determined to stick to the process, to focus on performance in the confidence that results will come. Sanderson, meanwhile, is candid over the adjustments from wearing a coach’s hat to that of a director of rugby’s. “I’m enjoying it, I’m really am,” says Lam. “This is the challenge, this is what coaching is about. It’s about walking to the pressure, about embracing it. If you don’t, you shouldn’t be in this job, you shouldn’t be involved in any sort of coaching if you’re only looking for wins and successes. At the end of the day, when you’re dealing with team sport, you’re taking everyone through the journey. Keeping everyone aligned and on target and not being pulled down by things you can’t control.” Having been edged out by Exeter and Leicester, another physical contest is expected at Ashton Gate as Sanderson marks almost a year in the job at Sale. AJ MacGinty lines up for the Sharks against the side he will join next season but neutrals will be denied a scrum-half head-to-head between two England hopefuls in Sale’s Raffi Quirke and Bristol’s Harry Randall as the former is injured. “There have been some brilliant highs and some reality checks over the past year,” says Sanderson. “The biggest lesson is that it’s not all about rugby, I wish it was but there is so much on the exterior that goes into the role and the happy running of a club. It’s challenging, it makes you grow as an individual, you take all these things and make the most out of them and try to make sure they don’t take away from the performance of the team at the weekend. It’s a bit of a minefield at times. “We all have an ideal of what the environment and the culture and the on-field action for the players should be. That’s a pure part of the game but the reality of salaries, caps, Covid and its ripple effect, the up-management of investors as well, it is a distraction at times away from the pure art of coaching and trying to build a team. There are a lot of facets to running the club, it’s not just about the rugby. But I am enjoying it, it’s not like it’s‘woe is me,’ I wanted this, but I didn’t realise how much time and energy those other things would take up.”",Sport/Sport,Lam embraces pressure as Bristol and Sale lock horns trying to find spark,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/06/lam-embraces-pressure-as-bristol-and-sale-lock-horns-trying-to-find-spark
1/7/2022,"Some of America’s most prominent historians gave an urgent warning about the state of American democracy as they gathered on Capitol Hill on Thursday to commemorate the 6 January insurrection. Doris Kearns Goodwin and Jon Meacham condemned the attack on the Capitol, which was carried out by a group of former president Donald Trump’s supporters to disrupt the certification of Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election.  They warned that the US remained at a crucial turning point amid ongoing threats to its democratic systems. “What you saw a year ago today was the worst instincts of both human nature and American politics,” Meacham said. “And it’s either a step on the way to the abyss or it is a call to arms figuratively for citizens to engage.” Echoing Meacham’s message, Goodwin argued that this moment represents an opportunity for Americans to rededicate themselves to the cause of democracy, citing the example set by those who fought for the Union in the civil war and marched for civil rights in the 1960’s. “We’ve come through these really tough times before,” Goodwin said. “We’ve had lots of people who were willing to step up and put their public lives against their private lives. And that’s what we’ve got to depend on today. That’s what we need in these years and months ahead.” The historians’ comments came as many Americans, particularly those who support Trump, continue to deny the dark reality of the Capitol insurrection. Only about 4 in 10 Republicans describe the 6 January attack as very violent or extremely violent, according to a recent AP-NORC poll. About 30% of Republicans say the insurrection was not violent at all, while another 30% say it was only somewhat violent. The insurrection resulted in the deaths of five people, including US Capitol police officer Brian Sicknick. In the year since, four other law enforcement officers who responded to the Capitol that day – Capitol police officer Howard Liebengood, and Gunther Hashida, Kyle DeFreytag and Jeffrey Smith of Washington’s Metropolitan police department – have died by suicide. More than 100 other officers were injured on 6 January, and many of them continue to struggle with traumatic brain injuries, post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. At the historians’ event, House speaker Nancy Pelosi played a video depicting some of the violence that occurred during the insurrection. The video included footage showing law enforcement officers being beaten and attacked with chemical spray and hockey sticks by insurrectionists. “One year later, it is essential that we do not allow anyone to rewrite history or whitewash the gravity of what took place,” Pelosi said. Despite the chilling evidence of the insurrection’s devastating consequences, Trump himself used the anniversary as an opportunity to spread the “big lie” of widespread fraud in the 2020 election and downplay the violence of the attack. “To watch Biden speaking is very hurtful to many people. They’re the ones who tried to stop the peaceful transfer with a rigged election,” Trump said in a statement full of wrong and baseless allegations. “Never forget the crime of the 2020 presidential election.” In his own scathing remarks to commemorate the anniversary of the attack, Biden accused his predecessor of having “created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election,” and the president underscored the need to set the record straight about 6 January. “The former president and his supporters are trying to rewrite history. They want you to see election day as the day of insurrection and the riot that took place here on January 6th as the true expression of the will of the people,” Biden said on Capitol Hill. “Can you think of a more twisted way to look at this country – to look at America? I cannot.” Pointing to Trump and his allies’ alarming efforts to downplay the insurrection, Goodwin argued that the work of the House select committee investigating the Capitol attack was vital and could help prevent similar violence in the future. “We have to retell the story of what happened on January 6, with all of the gaps filled in,” Goodwin said. “And I do believe that a line will be drawn.”",News/US news,Historians mark 6 January with urgent warning on threats to US democracy,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/06/us-capitol-attack-historians-democracy-threat
