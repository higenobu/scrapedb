4/23/2022,"Politico reported on photos of conservative Rep. Madison Cawthorn wearing lingerie. The 26-year-old North Carolina politician responded about an hour later. He called the pictures ""goofy vacation photos during a game on a cruise."" Conservative North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn said Friday that pictures of him in lingerie published by Politico were part of a game on a cruise ship played before he took office. ""I guess the left thinks goofy vacation photos during a game on a cruise (taken waaay before I ran for Congress) is going to somehow hurt me?"" Cawthorn tweeted approximately an hour after Politico published the exclusive story. ""They're running out of things to throw at me,"" he added, encouraging Twitter users to also post their embarrassing vacation photos underneath his tweet. —Madison Cawthorn (@CawthornforNC) April 22, 2022 The 26-year-old Republican linked a Cruise Critic article that shows the same ""Quest"" logo in the background and describes a ""bawdy"" adult scavenger-hunt game played on Royal Caribbean cruises that often led to ""barely controlled chaos."" The article detailed a similar situation during a game in which a man ended up wearing a bra. Insider could not confirm the circumstances of the photo. Cawthorn's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Politico reported that two individuals ""formerly close to"" Cawthorn's campaign shared and confirmed the images. The report added that Cawthorn is seeking re-election against seven other Republican rivals and is in the midst of several other controversies — including calling Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy a ""thug,"" facing several driving tickets, and suggesting that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who does not drink, has a drinking problem. Cawthorn also claims that he was invited to an orgy in DC and commented on ""the sexual perversion that goes on in Washington,"" CNN reported in March. ""Cawthorn, 26, was raised in a conservative Baptist community in Henderson County, North Carolina, and has staked his political persona on arch-traditional Christian principles and the insistence of the importance of a kind of hypermasculinity,"" Politico reported. In early April, the conservative politician claimed that Democrats are waging a ""war on biology"" by supporting the rights of the transgender community. —CSPAN (@cspan) April 4, 2022 When asked by a reporter in 2020 about where his politics stand in relation to the LGBTQ community, Cawthorn described himself as ""traditional,"" but didn't believe the government should be able to dictate who marries who. He also added that he doesn't believe transgender youth should be able to receive gender-affirming surgery. Read the original article on Business Insider",U.S./INSIDER,Rep.

4/23/2022,"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) was grilled under oath in court Friday as she sought to defend her place on the ballot for this year’s midterms—and had some trouble keeping track of her own wild past statements. Greene insisted she couldn’t remember much throughout her testimony Friday as she was asked about her involvement with the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol. Greene’s status on the May 14 primary ballot was challenged by a Georgian voter, who argued she should be disqualified due to her encouragement of Congress not certifying Joe Biden’s 2020 win. “I do not remember” was Greene’s response to multiple questions about whether she spoke to government officials about the run-up to the Capitol attack, including election deniers Reps. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) and Paul Gosar (R-AZ) and anyone in the White House. A lot of “I do not remember” responses in a row pic.twitter.com/NU8F17AYCl — Acyn (@Acyn) April 22, 2022 Greene could not evade all her past actions, however. After she initially denied calling House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) a “traitor to our country,” the lawyer questioning her proceeded to pull out an exhibit contradicting her statement. She then tried to backtrack her initial denial, arguing Pelosi’s support for migrants crossing the border amounted to betraying her oath of office. “Oh no, wait, hold on now! I believe, by not securing the border, that violates her oath of office,” Greene said. The lawyer had to remind Greene that he had not asked about Pelosi’s commitment to her constitutional oath before citing a CNN article including Greene’s comments, which said Pelosi was “guilty of treason” which is “punishable by death.” Question: You think Pelosi is a traitor to the country
Greene: I’m not answering that
Question: You’ve said that haven’t you?
Greene: No I haven’t said that… Oh no wait pic.twitter.com/OSiN3uuDXJ — Acyn (@Acyn) April 22, 2022 “Did you say those words that are quoted?” the judge asked Greene after repeated evasions. “According to the CNN article, I did,” Greene said—before trying to spin her comments again. Question: Did you say these words?Greene: According to this CNN article I did… pic.twitter.com/cO6MFtfwFS — Acyn (@Acyn) April 22, 2022 Her past affinity for QAnon came back to bite her, too. Greene tried to paint the lawyer quoting her past comments as having “as many conspiracies as QAnon,” to which he asked her: “Well, you believe in QAnon, right?” “I—no, I did not say I believe in QAnon,” Greene insisted. MTG: ""You sound like you have as many conspiracy theories as QAnon at this point.""Lawyer: ""Well, you believe in QAnon, right?""MTG: ""I -- no. I did not say I believe in QAnon.""Lawyer: ""You don't believe in QAnon? ... she brought it up, your honor!"" pic.twitter.com/ffTnZFkFaU — Justin Baragona (@justinbaragona) April 22, 2022 Greene’s dalliance with amnesia is not new. After her head-turning appearance at the white nationalist America First Political Action Conference, Greene tried to deny knowing who white nationalist Nick Fuentes was and what he stood for. Her claims were almost immediately quashed after a photo of the two posing together was posted on Twitter. She is the second Republican lawmaker to face the threat of disqualification. Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-NC) also had his status challenged due to his actions on Jan. 6, but a judge struck it down. If Greene is found to be ineligible for the May 14 primary, a notice will be placed next to her name indicating votes for her will not count. Read more at The Daily Beast. Got a tip?
