4/2/2022,"There’s a voice inside the head of college freshman Alex (a remarkable, physically and mentally committed Isabelle Fuhrman) that drives her. Hectoring, inescapable: this inner voice is the reason she chose to major in physics, her weakest subject, just so that she can conquer it. It’s the reason that not only does she sign up for the college’s novice rowing programme, she pushes herself to bleeding and breaking point to be the best, to make it into the elite varsity team. This voice, a muttered inner mantra that is as compulsive and damaging in its way as the impulse to self-harm, is integral to this stunning feature debut, contributing to the film’s intriguingly textured and three-dimensional sound design. The aural component of the movie – voices flayed and torn up, bleeding into a score that at first nods to the austere traditions of the campus, before taking on a more clattering and agitated character – is foregrounded to an unusual degree. It’s not surprising to learn that its writer and director, Lauren Hadaway, who based this film on her own experiences on a college rowing team, has a background in sound editing. Hadaway’s sound department work includes Zack Snyder’s Justice League and Quentin Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight. But it’s another of her credits, Damien Chazelle’s Whiplash, which is the most useful reference point for The Novice. Both films are punishingly intense portraits of ambition tipping over into obsession. Both are stylistically bold and confrontational pieces of film-making. Both feature central performances which are feats of physical endurance. And both announced a significant new voice in US cinema. I can’t wait to see – and hear – what she does next.",Arts/Film,The Novice review – stunning debut passes the university challenge,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/02/the-novice-review-lauren-hadaway-stunning-debut-passes-the-university-challenge
4/2/2022,"Barbara Trapido’s marvellous novel Brother of the More Famous Jack has just been reissued to celebrate the 40th anniversary of its first publication. The title alone deserves a party. It puts its finger on a big category – the person who gets used to being an adjunct. It’s a category traditionally inhabited by women and was nailed in an excellent poem, also from the 1980s, by Selima Hill: “I am the wife of the man who won first prize.” The prize Hill mentions was for a painting and I often remember her poem when looking at 20th-century artists and their male sibs or hubbies: Tirzah Garwood and Eric Ravilious, Gwen and Augustus John, Winifred and Ben Nicholson. It came to mind again recently when I visited the village of Les Arques in the Lot region of France, where a museum is dedicated to the sculpture of Ossip Zadkine. It is an intense experience. In the parish church, Zadkine’s huge crucifixion twists opposite a pietà; one room is filled with his wooden mythological works, another with bristling bronzes – a group under bombardment, arms outstretched, struck home hard. In one corner is some utterly different work: vital, citrus, fluid paintings. They are by Valentine Prax, the sculptor’s wife, who guarded her chap’s work during the Second World War when he was in America, and burnt much to save it from the Nazis. Ah. Wife of the more famous Zad. A few weeks ago, I was given the best ever lesson in how to be a critic. By a performer. At London’s Linbury theatre, the mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato gave a masterclass to three young singers. Dressed like a principal boy – violet frock coat over jeans – she was a compelling presence; as if caught in headlights, the performers began to mirror her movements. DiDonato was rapt but not reverent. She had a go at Covent Garden seat prices and put it to a tremendous bass that he need not be polite to Handel; he might suggest in his aria that the composer could go on a bit. She lit up Shakespeare, suggesting that Iago should have the dreadful sincerity of a false friend, delivering fake news to his Othello as if it hurt him to utter every word. She advised a soprano that she would break more hearts if she sang one phrase less perfectly. She managed to suggest they were all in this together; that she was totally on their side – and totally against their being less than superb. I would be preening if I could get into a column a smidgen of her insight. I complained to a Swedish friend the other day that I needed something non-compulsive to watch. I still haven’t dared to begin the last series of Succession, knowing I’ll be transfixed for hours. She suggested Bonus Family, a Netflix series about divorces and stepchildren, not wildly dramatic and completely true to Swedish life. Together with Danny Robins’s nifty radio sitcom The Cold Swedish Winter, it has proved the perfect Scandi antidote to noir. It gets the soap balance between drama and daily routine just right; it also has superb child actors. Counselling sessions frame each episode: the therapists, a heterosexual couple, appear in dun-coloured homespun tunics and identical wire specs. Having anticipated smoked glass and clear surfaces, I was sceptical about the clutter and porcelain ducks in the home of the matriarch. Very Swedish, my friend assured me. Other aspects were more stereotypical. Running through the agenda for an office meeting, a boss turns to his colleague and briskly addresses the last item: “Sex tonight?” The series has not, though, worked as methadone. It is not excitement that addicts you to a soap: familiarity – in the case of The Archers, even boredom – is the thing. After one episode I was hooked.

4/2/2022,"After his ratings plunged in the wake of “partygate” and as his government faces demands to act over the cost of living, it may be a surprise to discover that Boris Johnson’s face can be found on leaflets for the forthcoming local elections. Unfortunately for the prime minister, it is not his own party’s literature that features his image. The Observer has seen Conservative leaflets circulated in London, the Midlands and the north of England in recent weeks. None of them shows Johnson, once regarded as the Tory politician able to reach voters that no one else in his party could. In the London borough of Sutton, however, the Liberal Democrat canvassing material has the PM in pride of place on the front. Next to him is Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, and both are accused of failing to take enough action on energy prices and the cost of living – while increasing taxes. “The prime minister isn’t featuring on any of the leaflets,” said a Tory MP in a council area where the party had hoped to make gains before partygate unfolded. They said that at one point, local voters would have carried Johnson in victory down the high street, but he would now struggle to get polite handshakes: “A lot of candidates are now trying to make this about local services. It would be pretty odd on that basis to feature the prime minister.” With Johnson seemingly not the electoral asset he once was, many Tory council candidates appear to be trying to run hyper-local campaigns. A leaflet in Surrey prioritises defending the green belt and repairing local roads and footpaths. Another in Richmond, London, includes a list of “good reasons to vote Conservative”. It features the plea: “We are local residents, not national politicians.” The latest edition of the “Birmingham champion” leaflet produced to support Tory West Midlands mayor Andy Street does not feature the PM. In fact, with its green graphics and personal branding for the mayor, the Conservative logo is nowhere to be found. Another leaflet in Stockport vows to take on Labour’s Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, but does not show Johnson. The Conservatives are braced for a difficult set of elections in London, where they have been losing ground even while Labour was well behind in the polls nationally. Some had feared losing the key London borough of Wandsworth, though senior Tories said last week that they believed the invasion of Ukraine may have helped partially restore the party’s fortunes, but only temporarily. One Tory MP said that there was frustration with Johnson. “Voters may be on a timeout with partygate, but this is coming back,” they said. Some Tories in London are also trying to pin the blame for council tax increases on Sadiq Khan, which they say is starting to get through to voters. “It might save the Tories from a meltdown in some areas,” said one veteran campaigner. “It is just possible that the Tories will hold on to Wandsworth. It’s harder to win Westminster, but there might be some surprise results.” In response to the Lib Dem leaflet in Sutton, a Tory source said: “If you want to compare the electoral successes of Boris Johnson and Ed Davey, I think we all know who the electoral asset is.”",News/Politics,Boris Johnson is an asset in the local elections – but on rival parties’ leaflets,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/02/boris-johnson-is-an-asset-in-the-local-elections-but-on-rival-parties-leaflets
4/2/2022,"The former Labour politician Ed Balls served as secretary of state for children, schools and families under Gordon Brown and as shadow chancellor from 2011 to 2015. Born in Norwich in 1967, he studied at Oxford and Harvard and worked as a journalist for the Financial Times. He became an adviser to Brown in 1994 and was elected as an MP in 2005. Since quitting politics, Balls has appeared on Strictly Come Dancing and became a professor at King’s College London. He’s married to the Labour politician Yvette Cooper and lives in north London. His memoir, Appetite: A Memoir in Recipes of Family and Food, is out in paperback now (Simon & Schuster). Grey’s Anatomy During the lockdown at the end of 2020, my youngest daughter and I started watching Grey’s Anatomy. Since then, we’ve watched 17-and-a-half series and every day we check to see when the second half of series 18 is going to air. It’s steamier than other hospital dramas and very in-depth on the surgery. We’ll often yell at the TV: “Pump some epi!” or: “You’ll have to crack that chest!” It began to run out of steam, but series 17, where they tackle the pandemic, is brilliant, powerfully capturing the helplessness that experienced doctors felt. Choral Evensong, BBC Radio 3 I listen to this programme of choral music every Wednesday afternoon. It’s the longest-running live broadcast in the world, on the BBC since 1926, and it’s very calming. And the most exciting thing has just happened: I’m a big fan of Herbert Howells, probably the best choral music composer Britain’s ever had, and I’ve been asked to make a programme on him for Radio 3. I can choose a piece by Howells and conduct the BBC Singers performing it – my conducting debut. I told my dad and he said: “Don’t worry, they’re so good, they’ll be able to do it and ignore you entirely.” The Magician by Colm Tóibín This imagined biography of Thomas Mann is great and particularly powerful in the current environment. It’s partly about the chaos of Mann’s family and the suppression of his sexual life, but it’s also about the torment of his nationalism. You see Mann’s German pride slowly collapsing over his life and he ends up fleeing Nazi Germany for America. It makes you think what it must be like to be a proud Russian intellectual in this period and the turmoil of that. Joshua Redman I’m really eclectic in my music choices: I like choral music, Dolly Parton and ELO, but my favourite jazz performer is the American saxophonist Joshua Redman. He had an album out in 2020 called RoundAgain, which was supposed to kick off a tour of America and Europe but it got cancelled because of the pandemic. I just found out that he’s playing at the Barbican in November. I’ve got my tickets. It’s a lifetime ambition to see him live. I think he is one of the greats. Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy (CNN/BBC) Stanley Tucci’s exploration of his Italian heritage through food is lovely television; I watched all six episodes in one week. It’s the most comforting programme you can imagine, like sinking into a warm bath of spaghetti. You think there must be a moment when Stanley doesn’t find the food delicious, but it never happens. He loves all of it. He’s such a friendly, warm presence and he captures something of the politics of Italy, too. The episode about Milan and the very different cuisine in the north is really good. Mamushka: Recipes from Ukraine & Beyond by Olia Hercules I was on Saturday Kitchen last August with the Ukrainian chef and food writer Olia Hercules. We were both talking about family and food and she made a steamed, fruit-filled bun called a pyrizhky. It was very evocative for me, because as a young journalist in the early 90s, I spent a lot of time in Ukraine and the food there was very memorable. Afterwards, I bought Olia’s first cookbook, Mamushka, so I could do some Ukrainian cooking. At the moment, I’m making borscht, vareniki [dumplings] and pampushki [garlic rolls] and feeling Ukrainian solidarity. Munich: The Edge of War This is a new Netflix adaptation of Robert Harris’s novel about the 1938 Munich agreement. The book, which takes a revisionist approach, is great and this adaptation doesn’t disappoint. Harris’s argument is that Chamberlain knew Hitler was going to declare war or similar, but he also knew that Britain and America weren’t prepared and therefore he decided to sacrifice himself and his reputation to buy time for rearmament to occur. Jeremy Irons is brilliant as Chamberlain and George MacKay, who plays the young British protagonist, is really good, too.",Arts/Culture,On my radar: Ed Balls’s cultural highlights,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/02/on-my-radar-ed-balls-cultural-highlights
4/2/2022,"The relentlessness of Liverpool will trouble Pep Guardiola more than the form of his only rivals for the Premier League title. Jürgen Klopp’s team were far from their fluid, dominant best against relegation-threatened Watford but that was an irrelevance alongside a 10th successive league win that took Liverpool top before Manchester City’s visit to Burnley. Diogo Jota struck once again and Fabinho converted late on from the penalty spot, awarded following the VAR’s intervention, as Liverpool also recorded a 10th consecutive league win at Anfield. They were strong rather than stylish against an awkward opponent, clinical more than creative with Mohamed Salah quiet on his return from an arduous international break, but they got the job done yet again. The early kick-off could not dampen the heightened expectation inside Anfield as Liverpool looked to usurp Manchester City at the summit of the Premier League, however briefly. But Watford would make life difficult. Their three clean sheets in the league this season have all come on Roy Hodgson’s watch and, with trusted assistant Ray Lewington alongside him, the former Liverpool manager oversaw a typically well-drilled defensive display from his team. The visitors possessed a clear threat too, on the break and from set pieces, and performed with a composure that belied their lowly league position. Ismaïla Sarr had the game’s first opportunity when played through by Christian Kabasele’s clearance out of defence. His half-volley dipped over Alisson but also over the Liverpool goalkeeper’s crossbar. Cucho Hernández had another decent chance for Watford when connecting with Imran Louza’s corner to the near post. His glancing header was straight into Alisson’s hands. Their best chance of the first half fell to Juraj Kucka, who started and finished an incisive counterattack that involved João Pedro sweeping forward before releasing the midfielder clear on the left. Kucka, adjudged onside by the assistant referee (the VAR may have ruled otherwise), drilled low towards the far corner only for Alisson to again intervene. It proved a key save, for 34 seconds later Liverpool were ahead. Klopp’s title contenders had struggled to disturb Watford’s compact, protected back four - despite the polished distribution of Thiago Alcântara - until the moment Jordan Henderson found Joe Gomez galloping into space on the right. Gomez was deputising at right-back for Trent Alexander-Arnold, who returned to the bench following a rapid recovery from a hamstring injury, and did so perfectly with a superb first time cross his England colleague would have been proud to call his own. Gomez’s delivery behind the Watford back line created uncertainty among Ben Foster and Kiko Femenía. The full-back failed to track Jota’s run across goal while the goalkeeper flew out fists-first but failed to connect. Jota, keeping his eye on the ball and not on the keeper soaring towards him, bravely flicked home his 20th goal in all competitions this season. Jota almost made it 21 before half-time when Andy Robertson’s shot cannoned off Joel Matip and into the path of the unmarked Portugal international. Foster, standing tall, blocked the striker’s drive with his chest. Liverpool’s breakthrough did not spread panic through the visiting ranks or upset their effective game-plan. The impressive Kabasele produced a superb clearing header to prevent Jota connecting with another inviting Gomez cross moments after the restart. Virgil van Dijk and Jota headed over from a Curtis Jones corner and a Henderson free-kick, respectively. Watford, however, created a glorious chance to equalise when Sarr escaped down the left and turned a perfectly weighted pass inside to Pedro. The unmarked striker had only Alisson to beat, and the entire goal to aim for, but stroked a poor finish wide of the far post. Victory and top spot for at least a few hours for Liverpool was secured in the final seconds when theVAR advised referee Stuart Attwell to check a possible penalty after Samir had cleared a Henderson corner. There was no possible about it. Kucka clearly hauled Jota to the ground as the corner was taken and Attwell needed only a brief check of the pitch-side monitor before awarding a spot-kick. Substitute Fabinho swept the penalty into the top corner and Liverpool into pole position.",Sport/Football,Diogo Jota helps see off Watford as Liverpool make it 10 in a row,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/02/liverpool-watford-premier-league-match-report
