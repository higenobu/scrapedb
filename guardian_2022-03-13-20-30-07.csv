3/13/2022,"A Republican congressman attacked by Donald Trump at a rally in South Carolina on Saturday called the former president a “would-be tyrant”. Tom Rice voted to impeach Trump over the deadly Capitol attack and will face a Trump-endorsed challenger later this year. In a statement, Rice said: “If you want a congressman who supports political violence in Ukraine or in the United States Capitol, who supports party over country, who supports a would-be tyrant over the constitution, and who makes decisions based solely on re-election, then Russell Fry is your candidate.” Trump has praised Vladimir Putin and avoided invitations to condemn him but he has called the Russian invasion of Ukraine a “crime against humanity”. The attack on the US Capitol on 6 January 2021 happened after Trump told supporters to “fight like hell” in service of his lie that his defeat by Joe Biden was the result of electoral fraud. Seven people died around the riot. Rice was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump for inciting the attack. Trump was acquitted when only seven Senate Republicans voted to find him guilty. Like all House Republicans, Rice supported Trump when he was impeached a first time, for withholding military aid to Ukraine in an attempt to extract dirt on Biden. Trump has endorsed challengers to disloyal Republicans prominently including Liz Cheney of Wyoming, one of two Republican members of the January 6 committee. At his rally in Florence, South Carolina on Saturday, Trump attacked Rice and Nancy Mace, a congresswoman with her own challenger after voting to certify election results. The former president called both “atrocious Rinos”, Republicans in name only, and “bad people”. He called Rice a “disaster” and “a total fool … laughed at in Washington”. “Thankfully this June you have a chance to dump these grandstanding losers and replace them with two rock-solid America-first champions,” Trump said. Rice retorted: “Trump is here because, like no one else I’ve ever met, he is consumed by spite. I took one vote he didn’t like and now he’s chosen to support a yes man candidate who has and will bow to anything he says.” Rice’s South Carolina district is deep Republican red. In 2020, Trump won it by 18 points. Rice won by nearly 24. The Associated Press reported on how Rice and Mace are trying to convince voters to back them. Mace emphasised her support for Trump, the AP said, while Rice took a “lower key” approach. The AP described the congressman “quietly winding through rural stretches of his congressional district to remind voters of his work securing federal relief for frequent – often disastrous – flooding, and of his advocacy for agricultural improvements”. Of his vote to impeach Trump, he said: “I’ve had some people come to me and say, ‘I was disappointed in your vote’. But 10 times as many have said, ‘Thank you.’”     ",News/US news,‘Would-be tyrant’: Republican targeted by Trump at rally hits back,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/13/trump-tyrant-south-carolina-rally-tom-rice-nancy-mace-capitol-attack
3/13/2022,"First it was a financial crisis. Then a decade of slow growth that bred political anger. After that came a pandemic. Just as the threat of Covid-19 appeared to be receding along came a European war. Welcome to the era of incessant crises. Comparisons are often made between today and the 1970s, and in some respects they are appropriate. A global economy already exhibiting plenty of inflationary pressure has been hit by an oil price shock, just as it was in late 1973. Almost half a century ago, the Opec oil cartel ratcheted up the price of crude during the Yom Kippur war. The sanctions imposed on Russia’s energy exports are having a similar – albeit so far less dramatic – impact. The cost of crude climbed to almost $140 (£107) a barrel at one point last week but it would need to rise a lot further – to $180 a barrel – to beat the 2008 record, once allowance is made for inflation. Even so, higher energy prices are something western governments could do without. US inflation has already hit 7.9% and will rise further over the coming months. Pretty much each month since last summer UK inflation has been higher than expected and it would be no real surprise to see it rise above 10% this spring. That’s still someway short of the peak in 1975, when inflation climbed above 25%. The first oil shock marked a turning point in postwar economic history because what followed was the transition from an approach based on demand management and full employment to one focused on liberalised markets and control of inflation. This took time: it was not really until the early 1990s – two inflationary shocks later – that the new system was fully established and seemingly all conquering. It was a period in which crises were punctuated by brief periods of stability. An even better example of the same phenomena is the three decades between the start of the first world war in 1914 and the end of the second world war in 1945 – a period that also included a pandemic, a legendary stock market crash, a period of mass unemployment and the rise of totalitarianism. In this reading of events, the long boom of the 1990s and the American hegemony ushered in by the end of the cold war was the equivalent of the pre-1914 Edwardian summer, with the subprime mortgage crisis starting small in August 2007 but causing profound ramifications. Attempts were made in the 1920s to restore the prewar status quo but none of them worked, at least not permanently. There was a period in the late 1920s – after Germany’s hyper-inflation – when it looked as if stability was returning but it improved impossible to turn the clock back to the world as it was pre-1914. Eventually, a new model was established, with reflation, higher welfare spending, progressive taxation and capital controls at its heart. But, once again, it took time. More than three decades elapsed between the demise of globalisation mark 1 dominated by Britain and the arrival of globalisation mark 2 dominated by the US. The current crisis has now lasted for almost 15 years. It has included the near collapse of the global banking system, the avoidance of a second Great Depression by the printing of large quantities of electronic money through quantitative easing, barely rising living standards, populist insurgencies, the retreat from globalisation and a pandemic. Two years ago this week, the UK was approaching its first Covid-19 lockdown. Rishi Sunak announced spending increases in his budget (an appetiser for what was to come) and shortly afterwards the Bank of England cut interest rates to a record low of 0.1%. In some ways the mood then was similar to today’s. Covid-19 was seen as a temporary roadblock on the way back to “normality” just as the higher inflation caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is seen as a transitory phenomenon, which will delay but not derail recovery from the pandemic. The Bank looks certain to raise interest rates by 0.25 percentage points this week while Sunak had no desire to turn his spring statement on 23 March into a mini budget but it looks like it could become one. So what happens next? Just as an aside, it is worth noting that the pandemic has not gone away, merely been crowded out as a news item by Ukraine. Infection rates have started to rise again after the easing of restrictions, while the displacement of millions of refugees across Europe will make it easier for the virus to spread. Currently, policymakers are paying more attention to the risk of a return to 1970s-style stagflation, which might come in two stages – a burst of inflation followed by stagnation. Higher energy bills are initially inflationary but are subsequently deflationary as they push up business costs and erode consumer spending power. There is, though, an unmistakeable sense that the old model is running on empty, while the talk of levelling up and greening the economy suggests that the equivalent of the economic settlement that brought stability to the post-war decades is lurking out there somewhere. The current era of permanent crisis has highlighted the faults of the current system and the difficulties involved in returning to the pre-2007 status quo. It hasn’t yet given rise to a fully fledged alternative, although history suggests that sooner or later it will. Taking 1900 as a starting point, the period since has followed a pattern: periods of stability and prosperity (1900-14, 1945 to 1973, 1991 to 2007) during which signs of problems to come became ever more apparent; and periods of crisis (1914-45, 1973-1991, 2007 to the present) during which a new paradigm gradually appeared. The longer and deeper the crisis, the more profound the eventual change.",News/Business,Incessant crises show old economic model is running on empty | Larry Elliott,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/13/incessant-crises-show-old-economic-model-is-running-on-empty-financial-crisis-covid-inflation-war
3/13/2022,"Minimalism has many guises. If the opening of the Dance Reflections season had featured the cleanest of compositions in Lucinda Childs’ 1979 Dance, Katerina Andreou’s BSTRD (2018) is a down-and-dirty feat of endurance, throbbing with a force at once vital and oppressive. Lights flare aggressively behind a raised platform. Andreou, determinedly casual in T-shirt, trousers and trainers, places a record on a turntable. It plays a hammering pulse, nail-like beats and a skull-drilling drone, all on a primordial four-count rhythm that keeps its stranglehold on the piece throughout.Part clubber, part folk dancer, always a slave to the rhythm, Andreou jogs, bops, bounces, jiggles and sidesteps, first straight-on, then side-on, then round the edges, each rudimentary step combo repeated right, then left, then right, then left.Sameness highlights moments of difference. She takes off her T-shirt. There’s an identical one beneath. She escapes from the platform, then returns to it. She flips the record. The B-side plays the same rhythm. There’s one big, nonreversible change: the end. Andreou exits, leaving chalky clouds and soothing piano chords hanging in the air. The physical and mental relief is palpable. Worth it? Still, it’s clear that Andreou is in pursuit of a path and a purpose. Christian Rizzo’s une maison (2019) follows a far more desultory, dreamlike dramaturgy. A mysterious white-masked man opens the set and mythic apparitions emerge several times: totemic celebrants in animal-head masks, figures towering in long conical hats, a ghost draped in white. Above the stage hangs an irregular lattice of strip lights, which flicker and glow like neurons in some artificial brain. Below, a pyramid of earth is dispersed in billowing spadefuls, and pairs of people ritually upend buckets of soil, raked over by the cone-heads.As the soundtrack veers from squeaks and crackles to booming beats, and back again, the 14-strong cast draw from a common repertoire of moves: low lunge, seated pike, shoulder stand, hand-holds, head-pushes. This imparts a loose coherence to the disparate group, which tightens at the end into a chain dance, in those animal masks, like a unified tribe. A dreamworld may need no sense of direction, but this journey has been, and felt like, a very rambling trip.

3/13/2022,"The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has declared he is “hungry” for victory, and predicted the federal election will be on 14 May during a 60 Minutes special spruiked by the presenter Karl Stefanovic as revealing the “real Albo”. Albanese said during the interview broadcast on Sunday night on the Nine Network that he has learned from “mistakes” from the Rudd/Gillard era – where he served as a cabinet minister and deputy prime minister – and from Labor’s defeats in the 2016 and 2019 elections. Asked by Stefanovic why Labor “stuff[s] it up so much” and why it finds it hard “to get into government and stay for any length of time”, Albanese replied: “We’re the party of big ideas, and we can sometimes I think be impatient about changing the world quickly. “We did some good things, but [much] of what we did, many of the things were dismantled and you need that long-term government.” Stefanovic opened Sunday night’s program by noting the Labor leader was a “nice enough bloke” but he added, “where the discussion might heat up is over whether he has the ticker to take on the top job”. Albanese insisted he was “hungry to win” and will leave nothing “on the field”. “I will work until 6 o’clock on what I suspect will be the 14th of May but we’ll wait and see, you heard it here first, I suspect that’s when the polling day is and then I will see what comes,” the Labor leader says. He said he had lost weight to be “match fit” for the election. He also cited the mind-focusing impact of a near-death experience during a car accident last January. The accident “made me absolutely determined to make a contribution to the country”. Albanese said he was hopeful of victory in the looming contest. He suggested voters were growing tired of Scott Morrison. “I think people are far more cynical about our opponents this time around, they know what Scott Morrison’s form is and therefore they’ll be more sceptical about what the government’s saying. “You look at even the photo ops this time, whether it’s the shampooing hair or whether it’s dare I say it, the ukulele playing … the welding without lifting up the mask before you weld – people look at that and go, ah, that’s not really his job.” Morrison was interviewed by the program back in February with wife Jenny. The prime minister performed a rendition of the Dragon song April Sun in Cuba on the ukelele during the episode. Albanese said of the memorable cameo: “I’ve seen it and heard it, and … now it can’t be unseen unfortunately.” Albanese was featured on the hustings in Tasmania. Stefanovic noted the Labor leader was pursuing a small-target strategy. The presenter said the “criticism” was the Labor leader was “being wrapped in cotton wool – his people are trying to protect [him] from any kind of mess up in the weeks leading up to an election exposure.” The Labor leader said: “Well, here we are Karl doing 60 Minutes.” Asked what he was “hiding”, Albanese said: “People might not always agree with me, but what you see is what you get. Scott Morrison’s got an issue with the truth.” The Labor leader canvassed elements of his past during the program, including the story of finding his Italian father after the death of his mother, and the end of his marriage to Carmel Tebbutt in 2019. He was frank about the emotional impact of the breakup. “I didn’t want the marriage to end. “I didn’t see it as ending. We’d spent Christmas together, I thought we would end our life together. That was the vision that I had.” The end of his marriage “was really difficult to come to terms with”. Stefanovic asked Albanese whether he was “in love” with his new partner, Jodie Haydon. He replied: “That’s something not for you, Karl. That’s something between me and Jodie.” Albanese said he was “protective” of his new relationship. “I’m the one running for public office. “Jodie has to put up with if we’re out having dinner, put up with people coming up and photos and all of that. But it’s part of the deal, it’s part of who I am.” Asked whether he shared any vices in common with the former Labor prime minister Bob Hawke, Albanese said: “No, I’m a pretty straightforward bloke and I’ve never had a cigarette in my life. “I’ve had the odd beer or two or three or four. It must be said, well, I’ve got my own beer named after me, mate.”",News/Australia news,Anthony Albanese says he is ‘hungry’ for election win and has learned from Labor’s past ‘mistakes’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/13/anthony-albanese-60-minutes-interview-election-2022
3/13/2022,"Thirteen-year-old Mei Lee (voiced by Rosalie Chiang) is just like any other high-achieving dork from a loving, slightly smothering Chinese-Canadian family. Then her hormones kick in. Like many kids at this pivotal moment, her emotions take on a life of their own. What sets Mei Lee apart is the fact that her emotions also take on a form of their own: at moments of extreme excitement (and since Mei Lee is 13, extreme excitement is the default setting), she turns into a large red panda. Pixar’s latest, and the first feature from Domee Shi (director of the terrific short film Bao, about a sentient dumpling), Turning Red is a fizzing, squealing adolescent explosion of a movie that nails a fundamental truth about growing up. Puberty may be something that pretty much everyone has to endure, but at the time it feels like a uniquely mortifying and personal experience. What doesn’t help Mei Lee is that, at the very moment her body takes on a mind of its own, her mother seems to lose hers. Over-protective Ming (Sandra Oh) pursues her daughter to school with armfuls of sanitary pads. And this is the gently radical core of this appealing animation: it’s that vanishingly rare thing – a piece of pop culture that not only addresses menstruation, but does so in a constructive manner. The message is one of female friendship, embracing change and cuddling your inner panda, of working through mother-daughter friction. Here, there’s a kinship with Pixar’s Brave, but for the most part Shi visually references Japanese anime, in particular the uplifting, female-led storytelling of Ghibli’s Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata.

3/13/2022,"On the sort of crisp, bright day that Cheltenham festival regulars love, artists Emily Johnson and Andy Owen-Smith were to be found in a gallery in the Montpellier area of the Regency town, putting the final touches to an exhibition celebrating the power of the horse and the hustle and bustle of race day. “There’s real sense of excitement in Cheltenham,” said Johnson. “I’ve been dropping off flyers in the hotels and they are all packed.” Owen-Smith agreed: “I think there’s pent-up demand for the festival; the town can’t wait for it.” Last year’s festival took place behind closed doors because of Covid. In 2020 it was staged under a cloud as the Covid crisis loomed and it has come to be regarded by many as a super-spreader event. This March, racegoers and townsfolk are embracing the prospect of four days of sport – and partying – with particular fervour. Andre Klein, the racecourse’s community engagement manager, said tickets had been snapped up faster than ever before. “Gold Cup day [Friday] was sold out in mid January and Thursday sold out shortly after that,” he said. Klein has been touring the Gold Cup around workplaces, schools and venues in the town. “There’s a real sense of anticipation. That first roar on Tuesday will be very special.” The festival is an annual riot of colour and life that for many signals the start of spring. Royals and aristocrats rub shoulders with reality TV stars, footballers, farmers and excited gaggles of fun-seekers.

Thousands of Irish people make the pilgrimage to Gloucestershire and extra flights have been put on to bring in punters from Dublin, Shannon and Cork to Bristol and Birmingham. Lindsey Holland, who runs the Cleeve Hill hotel near the course, said her regulars were bitterly disappointed that they couldn’t come last year. “It’s lovely to be welcoming back old friends again. This is the first week for months the hospitality industry has been able to go at it full throttle,” she said Despite last year’s hiatus, Holland said most Cheltenham businesses had survived. Only one of a 45-strong collective of independent hospitality businesses – a small restaurant – has shut down. “People have proved to be very resilient,” said Holland. Cheltenham borough council said it was expecting the 2022 festival to bring in more than £100m to the local economy. “It will be a very different feel to last year,” said Cllr Victoria Atherstone, cabinet member for culture, wellbeing and business. “From hotels and restaurants through to taxi drivers and shops, the economic ripple effect from the festival week extends far beyond the racecourse.” So many are grateful the festival is back. It is a money spinner for organisations such as Cheltenham Tigers Rugby Club, which charges racegoers to park at its site and provides breakfasts and beer. “It’s our biggest fundraiser,” said chair Steve Ratcliffe. “We’ll be serving our first pint of Guinness at about 9am on Tuesday.” On-course bookmaker Lynn Garritty has painted her nails in the colour of jockey silks to mark her return. “I haven’t done that before but thought it was worth a special effort this year,” she said. “Everybody is buzzing about the festival.” Back in Montpellier, signwriter Dawn Evans was completing a picture of a bottle of Irish whiskey on the shopfront of John Gordons wine and spirits bar. At the James of Montpellier gentlemen’s outfitters, staff were doing a brisk trade in tweed suits, ties and pocket squares. “Young people like to dress up as if they are country folk,” said salesman Graham Ellis. There are some doubters, of course, who point out that Covid has not gone away. Cllr Paul Hodgkinson, the leader of the Liberal Democrats on Gloucestershire county council, said: “We are seeing a rise in Covid cases across the country following the government’s decision to abandon all safety restrictions. “The sad fact is that hospitalisations from Covid in Gloucestershire are back up to levels not seen since the height of the pandemic last year. There is no doubt that the full races are bound to spread the virus further.” The doubling of the town’s population throws up other safety issues. Police are carrying out extra patrols aimed at keeping women and girls safe. Licensing officials are clamping down on unlawfully operated taxis and private hire cars. And this year there will be signs of the war in Ukraine. The Jockey Club, which owns and runs the racecourse, is raising money for the people of Ukraine and renaming a race the Ukraine Appeal National Hunt Chase, while the horse Lisnagar Oscar will be ridden by a jockey in the colours of the Ukraine flag on Thursday. At the Shamrock pub in Cheltenham, landlady Caroline Morrissey was flying the flags of the Irish counties Galway and Laois. “It was very strange not having the Irish here last year,” she said. “It will be wonderful to welcome everyone back.”",Sport/Sport,‘The town can’t wait’: Cheltenham raring to go as festival returns,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/13/cheltenham-festival-2022-returns
3/13/2022,"Local councils will be given £10,000 for each Ukrainian refugee welcomed into their area, the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, has promised, as he called for “every available bed” to be offered under a new “homes for Ukraine” scheme. Households will be invited to register from Monday if they are willing to provide a room for a Ukrainian refugee. Gove said charities could then help to match them with individuals seeking sanctuary. “We want to make sure that every available bed that we have in this country that can be made available, every available home that can be made available, to those who are fleeing persecution, is mobilised, and we know that there a large number of people in this country, generous-hearted and in a position to provide homes – and businesses and charities as well,” he said on Sunday. “What we’re doing is saying, we the government will act in solidarity and in cooperation with you.” He said the government would pay £350 a month to families hosting a refugee, which they would have to agree to do for at least six months. The refugees would be allowed to work, Gove said. They will be entitled to NHS care and their children can attend local schools while they are in the UK. He said local authorities would be offered £10,000 for each individual to help facilitate that, with additional payments for children. Gove said he thought the scheme could lead to tens of thousands of refugees being housed in the UK. He also clarified reports that he was planning to seize the homes of oligarchs who have been placed under sanctions in order to house refugees. He said: “I want to explore an option that would allow us to use the homes and properties of sanctioned individuals, for as long as they are sanctioned, for humanitarian and other purposes.” He acknowledged there was a “quite a high legal bar to cross”, however, and said even if it did go ahead, it would not mean “permanent confiscation” of the properties involved. “While you are not using or profiting from it, if we can use it in order to help others, let’s do that,” he told BBC One’s Sunday Morning programme. The government has faced furious criticism in recent days over its slow and bureaucratic response to the Ukraine refugee crisis, including from its own MPs, after ministers decided not to follow the EU’s lead and waive the need for visas. The home secretary, Priti Patel, told MPs last week it was important for the government to carry out security checks. Gove said the UK had accepted 3,000 applications for visas and pointed to Patel’s announcement last week of a new web-based application process due to come into force on Tuesday. Asked whether he would be signing up to provide a room to a refugee himself, Gove said: “I am going to make sure that I do everything I can as an individual to support. Every individual will have their own circumstances.” The Irish taoiseach, Micheál Martin, told the BBC on Sunday that his country had already accepted 5,500 refugees. “Our primary impulse is to assist those fleeing war. The Irish people are very seized by the series of atrocities that are going on, what we are witnessing on our screens is really shocking people and there’s huge human empathy there,” he said. Last week, the Irish government said Patel had contacted them to raise security concerns about the number of people Ireland was accepting and the risk that they could enter Northern Ireland.",News/World news,"Councils to get £10,000 for each Ukrainian refugee welcomed, says Gove",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/13/councils-funding-each-ukrainian-refugee-welcomed-michael-gove
3/13/2022,"Stef Smith’s Nora: A Doll’s House, a response to Ibsen’s classic, had its nicely timed opening at Manchester’s Royal Exchange on International Women’s Day. Ibsen used to deny he had intended to write a feminist play but nothing trumps A Doll’s House (1879) in its scrutiny of a woman trapped within an oppressive marriage. Smith’s ingenious play, first performed in 2019, imagines three Noras, each inhabiting a different moment in time. The Nora of 1918 is gracefully got up in a long cream coat with a fur collar and is played with decorous charm by Kirsty Rider. The Nora of 1968 wears an unbecoming, shorter blue coat and is strikingly played by Jodie McNee who shows what it is to feel physically trapped, coiling in on herself like a stowaway within her own body. The Nora of 2018 is played with unhappy glamour by Yusra Warsama in a flowingly loose turquoise wrap but is as trapped as her predecessors in this eternal (we pray not too eternal) triangle. Amanda Stoodley’s set looks like a bistro, with occasional tables covered in lace cloths, and brittle wooden chairs. It begins with the Noras encircling the stage in a wintry rush, burdened with Christmas shopping. The modern Nora has grabbed a tiny, cut-price Christmas tree to take home. Smith skilfully portions out speech between them, their narrative is shared. For each woman, money is an issue and Smith contributes to Ibsen’s understanding of how Norah’s lack of economic independence is partly responsible for the instability of her marriage. She is good, too, on secrets and the difficulty women sometimes face in telling each other how they actually feel. And she has a fine sense of detail. She describes, in the household of each Nora, the pervasive scent of lavender and its bid for calm. A single actor plays Thomas, the husband. William Ash rises – or sinks – excellently to the challenge. He is disagreeably plausible no matter the century in which he finds himself. Like many a tyrant, he believes himself kind but is tiresomely condescending and with a short fuse. Daniel, Nora’s old flame, about to be extinguished forever, is played with intensity by Naeem Hayat and Andrew Sheridan is superb as blackmailing Nathan – a pale, hunted fellow who reminds us that predators sometimes double as prey. But for all its elegant intelligence, the contrivance of the play makes it impossible to adhere to any moment in time – context barely exists. Director Bryony Shanahan does her best to compensate with movement – as if, with so much going on, there is no need to settle in any place or time. At one point, the Noras dance like crazed fish on hooks to distract Thomas from reading the letter that might prove their doom (or salvation). But the play remains more a diagram than a furnished painting and while it is not fair to penalise Smith for not being Ibsen, one can see A Doll’s House any number of times and continue to feel the mounting foreboding Ibsen orchestrated. Here, there is strain from the start but no incremental building of tension. Foreboding is replaced by the empty peril of the foregone conclusion. You know what the outcome will be and the doll’s house becomes a waiting room. There is no such predictability to The Key Workers Cycle, a north London community-based project at the Almeida. These animated, heartwarming new pieces, envisaged as modern-day mystery plays, were commissioned during the pandemic and honour the unhonoured who kept – and keep – things going: teachers, rubbish collectors, midwives and so on. In one sense, it feels peculiar to be focusing on lockdowns precisely at the moment that coronavirus is being horrifyingly upstaged in our minds by the war in Ukraine. But might it be possible cautiously to celebrate the sense that, even though coronavirus is, alas, far from a thing of the past, the world these plays describe feels bizarrely close to being dated? I saw the cycle’s first tranche of three (there are nine plays all together). The first is Assembly: The Teachers’ Play, written by Sonali Bhattacharyya, a fresh, exuberant reminder of the chaos the pandemic caused in schools, splendidly directed by Kate Golledge. Josh Elliott’s The Full Works: The Funeral Directors’ Play is a fantastically weird, funny, macabre piece, tremendously acted by Chima Akpa, Jason Barnett and Bill Milner. It involves a personable corpse who lets us into his thoughts as he receives a close shave in the funeral parlour. There is wonderful direction by Emily Ling Williams. In Face the Music: The Social Care Workers’ Play, an astonishing lineup of older actors (from the company Well-Versed, part of the community arts organisation All Change) brings the house down – the oldest actor, the phenomenal Eula Harrison, is 96. They are moving, courageous and memorable – emphasising the importance of kindness, dreaming, dancing and the mutual care that helps us survive. Towards the end, Daphne Chamberlain tells us charmingly how she thinks of the ocean to cheer herself up and asserts that whenever she brings it vividly to mind, it is every bit as real as north London’s Balls Pond Road. There is a moment in Maria Friedman’s Legacy, a showcasing of musical numbers in celebration of Stephen Sondheim, Marvin Hamlisch and Michel Legrand, when she kicks off her high silver heels and leaves them by the piano. “They’re going off and they’re staying off,” she declares, like a Cinderella in reverse. “You’re in my home now,” she adds. But being a reverse Cinderella is risky – even when you are as charming as Friedman. Congratulating yourself on having been repeatedly invited to the ball does nothing to safeguard the present. Sondheim was a master of nostalgia, but this self-serving nostalgia-fest is too cosy by half. Friedman performs Broadway Baby, within the context of a decades-old triumph in which she wowed Sondheim himself. She tells us she learned to go “into the lyric” as a safe place to be. And while we can revel with her in the music’s slow stealth, the lyrics now seem neither here nor there. The show is saved by the young talent she has recruited. Friedman’s son, Alfie, performs Sondheim’s Franklin Shepard, Inc with adrenalised brilliance and Desdemona Cathabel, an Indonesian student at the Royal Academy, sings The Miller’s Son beautifully. And there are moments in which Friedman reminds us of the verve that made her name, especially when she sings one of Hamlisch’s greatest hits and shows us how to make something of Nothing.

On its south side, La Puntilla serves an elegant menu on a terrace overlooking colourful fishing boats; dishes include slow-cooked pil pil cod, the island’s goat’s cheeses and papas arrugadas (the Canaries’ traditional wrinkly potatoes), paired with Lanzarote’s up-and-coming wines. Across the water, Naia serves innovative tapas with local flavours; or try a squid-and-aioli bocata (filled roll) at Casa Ginory. Another favourite is Strava, on a narrow alley opposite Arrecife’s church, good for cheeses, cold meats and seasonal tapas. And Pastelería Lamontagne, on the road towards the beach, has been making French patisserie for almost 20 years. Don’t miss La Casa Amarilla for a trip into the island’s rural past. This yellow-tiled building was once Lanzarote’s Cabildo (government HQ) and its exhibitions are a marvel: the historic black-and-white photos often feature women at work in the fields or carrying supplies along the steep Camino de los Gracioseros, which leads down to the coast facing the undeveloped island of La Graciosa. The influence of the 20th-century architect and artist César Manrique is still felt all over the island. The Museo Internacional de Arte Contemporáneo, an 18th-century castle which Manrique remodelled in the 1970s, has displays of his paintings alongside work by other Spanish artists. Even the bathrooms have a design twist, with swirling whitewashed stairs and picture windows overlooking the ocean. NeighbourhoodAfter a stroll around the Charco de San Ginés, weave along Callejón Luis Hernández Fuentes, past the 17th-century Iglesia de San Ginés, to reach the centre’s lively pedestrianised streets. Overlooking Plaza de la Constitución, the BySiroco concept boutique stocks handcrafted Portuguese ceramics, vintage vinyl, sustainable fashion and great menswear. Nearby, Naad Beauty specialises in eco-friendly cosmetics. Jaira also showcases small-scale labels, while Caracola, opposite, sells fabulous Spanish-made shoes. Around the corner is Queso Project, which stocks artisanal cheesemakers; Somm & Company for gourmet products, such as Janubio salt and Stratvs wines; and Algomás, a deli packed with local goodies. In neighbouring Marina Lanzarote, La Corona does amazing handmade chocolates, and a few doors away Boho Espartería has beautiful homewares, including esparto-grass lampshades from Cádiz. In town, the golden sands of Playa del Reducto is a peaceful spot bordered by palms and with views across the Atlantic. But I recommend taking a 15-minute drive out into the lunar-like volcanic heart of the island, for a three-mile walk looping the crater of the Volcán del Cuervo near Tinajo. It was the first volcano created by the 18th-century eruptions here, and has a spectacular contrast of colours. Afterwards, pop down the road to El Chupadero in the wine-growing La Geria region for a glass of malvasía while watching the sunset. NightlifeThe town’s main nightlife area is now over in Arrecife’s marina, where club-bars such as Karma and La Grulla stay open late, though it’s still a relaxed scene. Or head to Niño Salvaje for cocktails and a tapa of croquetas. StayA 10-minute drive from Arrecife, my hotel, Álava Suites, has six rooms (doubles from €120 B&B) It is inspired by Lanzarote’s volcanic scenery and set among swaying Canarian gardens. Days start with breakfast by the pool. On the city seafront, the recently refurbished Arrecife Gran Hotel (doubles from €114) has a beachy feel and excellent arroces (rice dishes) and seafood at its restaurant, Alarz. María Álava is the Lanzaroteña founder of Álava Suites and its sustainably rooted fashion offshoot, Álava Brand",Lifestyle/Travel,"A local’s guide to Arrecife, Lanzarote: volcanoes, sunsets and seafood",https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/mar/13/a-locals-guide-to-arrecife-lanzarote-volcanoes-shops-seaside-restaurants
