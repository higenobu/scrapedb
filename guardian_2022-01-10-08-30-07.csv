1/10/2022,"Edinson Cavani, whom Barcelona are reported to be interested in signing, has informed Ralf Rangnick he will not depart Manchester United during this transfer window. “I told him that if it was up to me I would want him to stay and I had a conversation with him [last Thursday],” the interim manager said as he prepared for United’s FA Cup tie at home to Aston Villa on Monday. “We spoke for almost half an hour and he told me he will definitely stay and would want to stay until the end of the season.  “Not only because I told him that he should stay or has to stay, he did it on his own behalf, and he told me that I can rely on him to stay until the end of the season and give his very best. “He’s happy to play. But even if he’s not playing, he will be trying to be the best possible role model for the other players and for me this is good news because Edi is one of those players who, with his vast amount of experience, with his mentality, his work ethic, I think he could really be a perfect role model.”",Sport/Football,Edinson Cavani pledges to stay with Manchester United for this season,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/09/edinson-cavani-pledges-to-stay-with-manchester-united-for-this-season
