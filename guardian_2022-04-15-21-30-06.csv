4/15/2022,"A Conservative MP has shared a scientific paper that says the climate emergency is not happening. Steve Baker, the MP for Wycombe and a leading member of the Net Zero Scrutiny Group, shared the report, produced by the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), on his Twitter feed. He and the Net Zero Scrutiny Group, comprising about 20 Tory MPs, have previously said they do not deny the science around climate change but merely disagree with the costs involved in some of the methods proposed to reach net zero. When asked if he agreed with the report, Baker said: “I am clear that questions of climate science should be handled scientifically. The last thing we need is politicians and activists twisting the science to their particular ends.” Baker is a trustee of the GWPF, and the group of Tories have used its research to make their arguments previously. Joe Tetlow, a senior political adviser for the Green Alliance, a charity and thinktank, said: “The mask has slipped. Promoting climate denial from GWPF is not scrutiny of policies but denying the basis for action. Dangerous and wrong.” The non-peer-reviewed paper is authored by a retired scientist, Ole Humlum, a former professor at the University of Oslo. He has repeatedly claimed that rather than human impact, it is the sun and moon’s influence on Earth that explains most of the historical and current climate change. In 2013 he predicted that the climate would most likely become colder in the next 10 to 15 years. In the new report he claims that only “gentle warming” has happened and that there is not a climate crisis. Humlum said: “A year ago, I warned that there was great risk in using computer modelling and immature science to make extraordinary claims. The empirical observations I have reviewed show very gentle warming and no evidence of a climate crisis.” The GWPF director, Dr Benny Peiser, said: “It’s extraordinary that anyone should think there is a climate crisis. Year after year our annual assessment of climate trends document just how little has been changing in the last 30 years. The habitual climate alarmism is mainly driven by scientists’ computer modelling rather than observational evidence.” By contrast, a recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found that human activity was “unequivocally” the cause of rapid changes to the climate, including sea level rises, melting polar ice and glaciers, heatwaves, floods and droughts. It said some effects of climate breakdown were now inevitable. Hundreds of scientists contributed to the IPCC report, with 234 in the first working group, 270 in the second and 278 in the third. It was signed off by the governments of all 195 member countries. Dr Ken Rice, an astrophysics professor at the University of Edinburgh, said of the GWPF report: “One of the most bizarre things about this is that they still can’t acknowledge that the rise in atmospheric CO2 is entirely anthropogenic. I had thought we’d moved beyond that. Clearly not.”",News/Politics,Tory MP Steve Baker shares paper denying climate crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/15/tory-mp-steve-baker-shares-paper-denying-climate-crisis
4/15/2022,"Britain will save money in the “longer term” by sending some asylum seekers to Rwanda, a minister has said after the reported cost of about £30,000 a person was described as “eye-watering”. Defending the decision to fly out many of those who arrive on the Kent coast to a country more than 4,000 miles away, Home Office minister Tom Pursglove said it would “crush” the business model of people smugglers. He added that those transferred would be able to embark on “fully prosperous” lives in Rwanda, and that the short-term costs would be “pretty equivalent” to what the UK is now paying to accommodate those claiming asylum. But another Tory MP, Andrew Mitchell, said it would be cheaper to put up those arriving in Britain at the Ritz for a year. The former international development secretary said the new scheme would prove “incredibly expensive” for British taxpayers – as well as being impractical and immoral. He added that a cost of up to £30,000 per person, covering their accommodation before and after the journey, as well as the one-way plane ticket to Rwanda, was “eye-watering”. The cost factor has worried other Conservative MPs. ITV News said the Home Office permanent secretary had sought a “ministerial direction” because of concerns about value for money – meaning the home secretary, Priti Patel, had to override civil servants’ qualms. But Pursglove said £120m had been earmarked for the initial cost of the scheme. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “As we move forward, we will continue to make contributions to Rwanda as they process the cases, in a manner that is similar to the amount of money we are spending on this currently here in the UK. “But longer term, by getting this under control, it should help us to save money. We are spending £5m per day accommodating individuals who are crossing in hotels. That is not sustainable and is not acceptable and we have to get that under control.” Patel was in the Rwandan capital, Kigali, on Thursday to sign the deal. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, is said to want to see the first migrants flown out in roughly six weeks – just after the local elections, when the Conservatives are braced for a difficult set of results. Pursglove would not give an exact timeframe for the first asylum seeker to be forcibly removed to Rwanda, but told Sky News that the policy would be implemented quickly. He added that those who had arrived in the UK since 1 January 2022 via “illegal means” could still be eligible to be “transferred as part of this arrangement” with Rwanda. Denmark has welcomed Britain’s deal with Rwanda and hopes other countries will follow. “I do not know the details of the agreement between Rwanda and the UK, but based on the public announcement it seems to be a good step forward,” said Denmark’s minister for immigration and integration, Mattias Tesfaye. “I hope more European countries in the near future will support the vision of tackling irregular migration through committed partnerships with countries outside Europe.” The wealthy Scandinavian country has become notorious for its hardline migration policies, such as last year’s decision to revoke the resident permits of Syrian refugees, arguing that parts of the war-torn country were safe to return to. In June 2021 the Danish parliament passed a law allowing the external processing of asylum claims, a move that was questioned by EU authorities at the time. Copenhagen has since been in talks with Kigali, but has not signed an agreement on the transfer of asylum seekers. Several EU countries have looked at similar offshore processing plans, but the ideas have never got off the ground. In 2018 the EU proposed “regional disembarkation platforms” in north Africa to process asylum claims of people rescued in the Mediterranean Sea, but failed to find countries willing to host them.",News/UK news,"Sending UK asylum seekers to Rwanda will save money, says minister",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/15/sending-uk-asylum-seekers-to-rwanda-will-save-money-says-minister

4/15/2022,"Every year, like clockwork, my tolerance for wearing a coat runs out a few weeks before winter ends. The heavy schlump on my back that felt so cosy and reassuring six months ago begins to get on my nerves. Coats start to annoy me even when I’m not wearing one. Getting from my hallway to the kitchen makes me feel like Lucy pushing her way to Narnia, only with less fur and more North Face nylon.And there is something so cheering about the first day you leave the house without a proper coat. It puts a smile on your face and a spring in your step – but not if you’re shivering by the time you get to work. So then, it’s time to address the crucial matter of spring layers. The hero of spring layering for 2022 is – drumroll, please – the scarf. The proper knitted kind, rather than the cutesy silk type, is a fashion accessory as well as a practical one for the first time in ages. It is the star of a cult Instagram account called Parisiens in Paris, which posts photos snapped on the Métro, at the bakery, crossing the street. Parisiens in Paris is real street style, the way it was before it was cannibalised by overdressed influencers shivering on the Pont des Arts in borrowed gowns they’re paid to post about. It is a genuinely useful fashion resource, because it shows real-life humans, complete with bags and buggies, who look chic, for us to learn from. Also, although Paris weather gets much better PR than London weather, the climate is essentially the same, so these people wear layers and umbrellas and scarves. Lots of scarves. In one photo, a woman wears a check coat and a beige beanie, with a thick charcoal scarf around her neck, and a vintage-looking suede saddle bag. Another sits at a pavement cafe with a leather bomber jacket and a fringed scarf, a glass of wine and a novel. If the Hermès scarf is Ladies Who Lunch chic, the cosy woollen scarf is Pavement Cafe chic. And Pavement Cafe chic is about as #goals as it gets, both for the French Girl looks and the reading-a-book-with-a-glass-of-wine part. A scarf has always been a staple of real-life city chic. In the Sex and the City days, Carrie would sometimes wear a tartan scarf, tied just so and pinned in place with a cameo brooch. Fastening a scarf with a brooch is a red flag for me on a practical level, but I have to admit she looked kind of amazing. In And Just Like That, Carrie had a Gabriela Hearst rainbow-knit throw that she wore as a scarf and even took to hospital as a blanket. The coat that I saw most on showgoers at recent fashion weeks was by Totême, and is really a knitted jacket with attached scarf. It’s gorgeous but expensive and also, at the time of writing, out of stock – but it proves that a sturdy knitted outer layer combined with a scarf is practical, chic spring layering. Think of it as a nu-wave twinset. Two knitted pieces that don’t have to match but work together. It could be a cable-knit sweater and a contrasting long, fringed scarf, or a crew-neck jumper with a mismatched oversize cardigan. Or perhaps all three together. I know what you’re thinking, because I’m thinking it too. What if it rains? Then you’ll be sorry you flounced out of the house with no coat, you stroppy cow. The solution is a) a grownup baseball cap or b) a hoodie with a generous hood. Either of these, with a blazer, will see you right in a shower. You can forget your coat, if you remember to check your weather app. And wear a scarf, of course.",Lifestyle/Fashion,How to dress for spring?

4/15/2022,"Aman facing financial ruin fakes his disappearance while kayaking in the North Sea. His wife mourns with their two sons, has her husband declared dead and collects the insurance payoff, then he moves secretly into a hidden bedroom in their house. Later, the couple flee to Panama, where the scam unravels after an unwise photograph. The boys are summoned to meet their dead dad in a London police station. Screenwriter Chris Lang, who wrote ITV detective show Unforgotten, is known for creating twisty, psychologically complex plots, but the real-life story of John and Anne Darwin – which he has turned into his new ITV drama The Thief, His Wife and the Canoe – is beyond even his imagination. Such was media coverage of the story when the pair were tried and jailed in 2008 that Lang could have considered naming it Unforgettable. But more than a decade later, the exact details aren’t quite as easy to remember. “I was surprised how much I’d forgotten,” says Lang. “As I read the research material, I kept thinking: oh yes! But then there was a huge wealth of stuff I had no idea about: how they executed the idea, why they decided to come back.” Lang has conjured a vividly told farce about a hapless eccentric fantasist, which looks set to resonate with the public – judging by reactions to the show’s promotional material. “When I tweeted the first picture of the poster, there were people saying: ‘They were only going after insurance companies … and they’ve been fucking us over for decades,’” says Lang. “But that wasn’t the crime that attracted the prison sentences; it was what they did to their kids.” The unpleasant way Anne Darwin pretended to her children that their father was dead is what attracted Monica Dolan to play her. It’s the latest in a series of roles as criminals in ITV dramas, including prolific serial killer Rose West in Appropriate Adult and Maria Marchese, the London resident jailed for her terrifying stalking of an ex-boyfriend, in U Be Dead. Dolan relishes the challenge of parts viewers will dislike, maybe even detest. “I’m loth to make excuses for a character,” she says. “I just do what the character does in the script and try never to resist that.” Despite it being John’s idea to settle his huge debts by claiming his death payout, it was Anne who received the longer sentence: three months longer than the six years and three months her husband received. Just as Medea, who killed her children, is more notorious in Greek tragedy than numerous psychopathic men, maternal cruelty seems to have been viewed as more transgressive than that of the dad. “Sadly, we’re pretty used to men behaving appallingly to children,” says Lang. “There is something more interesting about a woman and mother committing this betrayal than a father.” Watching Lang’s version of events, viewers may conclude that Anne was a victim of coercive control by her husband, who is shown to have a strong romantic and sexual hold over her and to make all the decisions for both of them. This was raised in her defence, though, crucially, the concept of coercion was less legally defined than it is now. “When she was tried,” says Dolan, “the person accused of coercion had to be physically present at the time of every alleged offence.” So long-time psychological grooming or emails from Panama didn’t count. When the series was shooting in Hartlepool last April, Boris Johnson was in town, supporting his candidate in a byelection that turned the north-east seat Tory for the first time in five decades, partly due to the argument that such seats had been neglected by London politicians and exploited by the capital’s bankers. Dolan believes that, in that sense, the Darwins can be seen as victims: John, a man of modest background, was given loans to purchase a dozen buy-to-let properties. When he concocted his plot, he owed £700,000. “Not to diminish what they did,” says Dolan, “but the way the banks just loaned money to people, it was inevitable things like this would happen. The extent of their debt was mind-blowing.” Dolan stresses that she and Eddie Marsan as John are playing “characters written by Chris”. Neither Darwin parent nor their sons cooperated with the project, so it draws on research and the manuscript of an unpublished book by journalist David Leake. “You have to imagine a fair amount of it,” Lang admits. “You research and research then take that little leap. It is a guess, but it’s a really educated guess. You can’t say that really is what happened or what’s going through her mind. But how much do any of us know ourselves anyway? If I’d been able to sit down Anne and say: ‘Why did you do it?’ I’m not sure she’d be any clearer than me.” But without permission or input from the living originals, does the writer feel a responsibility to them? “Of course,” Lang replies. “There’s huge moral responsibility and we talked about it an awful lot. There’s a duty to the boys but also to John and Anne. You can’t defame them, you can’t make stuff up. In terms of the kids, I’d be astonished if they didn’t think it was a sympathetic portrayal of what happened to them. We are entirely on their side that this was a heinous crime against them.” But what if they just didn’t want to be dramatised in primetime and featured across the media again? “The rebuttal to that is that the boys gave a huge interview to the Daily Mail. Anne wrote a book and did many interviews. The Darwins have spoken to the press multiple times. So the being left alone defence doesn’t hold up.” The Thief, His Wife and the Canoe joins ITV’s Quiz (about the alleged “coughing” fraud to win Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?) and BBC One’s A Very English Scandal (reconstructing a murder plot instigated by then Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe) in an emerging subgenre of jaunty, comic real-life crime capers. Because no one died in any of these crimes – though a dog was killed in the Thorpe story – the dramatisations have more licence to entertain. The series’ executive producer David Nath says: “We said from the start we shouldn’t shy away from the humour in this. I’m starting to wonder if we are reaching a saturation point with hard dark true crime. What are the iconic stories of that sort left to tell? Also, with where we are in the world just now – first Covid, now Ukraine – I’m not sure if it’s the most inviting prospect to watch something really gruesome. I think the sweet spot is the true story that is also enjoyable.” Getting true stories right is also an obsession of Dolan. For Rose West, she trawled through a mound of NHS spectacles to find the right pair. With Anne Darwin, the challenge was dental – finding false teeth that would give the fuller-faced Dolan narrower features. And, although helped by having grown up in nearby Middlesbrough, she also worked with a dialogue coach on the tones of the Darwins’ native Seaton Carew. “One of the things I’ve learned is that if you are doing an accent you should learn it with your false teeth in! You don’t want to do it one way then put in the teeth and have to start again because the dentures change the sound,” she says. When the shoot was over, Dolan donned a different pair of dentures to play the pioneering artist Audrey Amiss in Carol Morley’s forthcoming biopic, Typist Artist Pirate King, then gave one of the year’s best stage performances as Sister Aloysius, a nun who suspects a priest of child abuse, in a revival of John Patrick Shanley’s Doubt: A Parable. Despite Aloysius being the kind of dislikable character she enjoys playing, there was a key difference – which caused problems. “I knew something felt wrong, and I had to consciously force myself not to put my hand to my mouth,” she says. “Then I realised it was because, for the first time in so long, I only had my own teeth!” There’s more continuity to come for Lang, who has moved on to the fifth series of Unforgotten, ITV’s brilliant police procedural, with Sinéad Keegan replacing Nicola Walker as Sanjeev Bhaskar’s cold crimes co-investigator. Both shows involve ordinary people doing one wrong thing they seem to have got away with, until fate exposes them. “That’s where my main interest lies,” says Lang. “I think we’re often on the verge of tipping over into extreme behaviour all our lives, and sometimes we do. So it’s about trying to understand that – and the stress that must place on the way you live your life. I suspect that certain people who’ve committed crimes are more adroit at living with that duality. But plenty of people are destroyed by it. That’s what I want to explore.” The Thief, His Wife and the Canoe is on ITV and ITV Hub from 17 April",Arts/Television & radio,"Death, fraud and canoes: how a mind-blowing insurance scam became an ITV drama",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/15/john-darwin-the-thief-his-wife-and-the-canoe-insurance-scam-itv-drama
4/15/2022,"A top Huawei executive has broken ranks to warn that China’s stringent zero-Covid policy may trigger “massive losses” for the tech industry, putting the country’s economy as well as the global supply chain at greater risk. “If Shanghai cannot resume production by May, all of the tech and industrial players who have supply chains in the area will come to a complete halt, especially the automotive industry,” Richard Yu Chengdong, head of Huawei’s consumer and auto division said in a WeChat post. “That will pose severe consequences and massive losses for the whole industry.” The comments from Huawei, a bastion of China’s tech industry, underline growing tensions as the country attempts to eliminate Covid by locking down Shanghai. As lockdown continues in the key financial hub and home to the world’s largest container port, economists have warned of heavy costs to both Asia’s biggest economy and the global supply chain. In recent days, Beijing has repeatedly reaffirmed its plan to handle Covid, which has been under heavy scrutiny as case numbers continue to rise in Shanghai despite a severe lockdown. In a news bulletin on state TV on Wednesday, President Xi Jinping urged his officials not to relax the pandemic control work. “Persistence is victory. Adhere to people above all else, life above all else … dynamic zero-Covid, grasp the details of the epidemic prevention and control initiatives,” Xi said, adding that “it is necessary to overcome paralysing thoughts, war weariness, fluke mentality and slack mentality”. But economists warned that the ongoing lockdown in Shanghai – if it persists for this month alone – will cost China’s most populous city and a key financial hub a 6% loss of GDP, which translates to 2% loss of GDP for the whole of the nation. This would, in turn, drag down by nearly 1% of China’s economic growth aim to 4.6%, according to Iris Pang, chief economist for greater China at the Dutch bank ING. The premier, Li Keqiang, last month set China’s annual growth target at “about 5.5%”. Last month, researchers at the Chinese University of Hong Kong said China’s lockdowns were likely to cost at least £35bn a month, or 3.1% of GDP in lost economic output. The authors also estimated that imposing full-scale lockdown on a major city such as Beijing or Shanghai would reduce the national real GDP by 4%, of which 7% is contributed by the spillover effects. Alicia García-Herrero, Hong Kong-based chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis, said that 40% of China’s GDP was already “in some form of lockdown”. “GPS data shows that China is already halfway to the mobility lost during the first Covid outbreak in Hubei province in 2020. As of 12 April, monthly mobility in China fell by 29% versus 2019, with 24 provinces seeing a decline.” In February 2020, the reduction in mobility was 66%, collapsing in 29 provinces, García-Herrero said. “The situation is particularly alarming for manufacturers in Shanghai, Jiangsu and Jilin – the key hubs for cars, electronics and semiconductors.” “We predict that for every month of lockdown in China, there’ll be 0.5% of reduction in China’s annual GDP,” she warned. “Beijing claims it wants economic growth, but it’s all about its priority after all – either to stamp out the virus or to allow the economy to grow. You cannot have both.” The lockdown has huge ramifications for the global economy, adding to strong inflationary pressures by choking off the supply of goods. Reports this week said almost 500 bulk cargo ships were moored off Shanghai, as the port struggles to handle them. 2022 is a crucial year for the ruling communist party. President Xi is expected to extend his rule during the 20th party congress later this year. ING anticipates that local governments as well as the central government in Beijing will top up their relief measures, increase fiscal support and ease monetary policy to help economic growth. The bank has revised China’s GDP growth rate down to 4% year-on-year from 5% for the second quarter of this year. The spillover effect of China’s lockdown is also being felt in other parts of the global supply chain. Since Chinese cities such as Shanghai and Jilin entered lockdowns, shares of the car and semiconductor producers have been hit hard. “This will have an impact on consumers elsewhere,” said García-Herrero. This week, Pegatron, a key iPhone maker, halted its operations at two subsidiaries in Shanghai and nearby Kunshan. The Taiwanese firm said it “actively cooperates with local authorities” and would try to resume operations as soon as possible. It followed the practice of Foxconn, another major supplier, which halted operations in the Chinese tech hub of Shenzhen in the southern Guangdong province in early March but later resumed “fundamental operations” later that month. The woes in Shanghai have added another level of uncertainty into an industry that has been under pressure since the start of the Covid pandemic. “The global supply chain is so finely tuned that any disruption at a major trading hub such as Shanghai will have a major impact across the world,” said Stephen Carr, commercial director at Peel Ports, one of the UK’s biggest port operators. “Whilst we are not currently seeing any direct impact at our ports, we are already handling enquiries from companies who are looking to use the port of Liverpool as an alternative to traditional southern ports in order to avoid any potential congestions further down the line.” The port shortages and disruption leave businesses facing a worrying scenario: running out of goods. “If the government extends lockdowns, the risk of supply chain disruptions will increase, and firms may use up their inventories… [If] Guangdong, which contributes 13% and 15% of car and chip production in China, also moves into lockdown, the supply shock will only worsen,” García Herrero said.",News/World news,"China’s zero-Covid policy threatens global supply chain, says Huawei exec",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/15/china-zero-covid-policy-global-supply-chain-huawei-executive
4/15/2022,"After the high drama of their royal exit, it was a low-key reunion behind the walls of Windsor Castle for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex with the Queen on Thursday. Prince Harry and Meghan may not have announced their visit in advance, the first by the duchess to Europe in the two years since the couple left the UK in March 2020 and unshackled themselves from formal royal life. But this would have been classed as a family occasion, “like all private get-togethers”, and not an official engagement, so would not have been announced in advance, according to Joe Little, the managing editor of Majesty magazine. “A very welcome if long overdue move on the part of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex,” he said of the meeting, which came one week before the Queen’s 96th birthday next Thursday. The couple are also understood to have met Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, who were at Windsor for the Maundy Thursday service at which Charles stood in for the Queen. But for a busload of tourists, who saw the Sussexes looking “relaxed” and happily waving back to castle visitors, as one later told the Sun, news of the reunion may not have emerged until the Sussexes had departed the UK for The Hague to attend the Invictus Games for wounded service personnel, founded by Harry. Harry, who last saw his grandmother in person at the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral a year ago, had faced heavy criticism from UK tabloids over his absence from last month’s memorial service for Prince Philip. At the time, his spokesperson said he had plans to visit his grandmother in the near future. Of Thursday’s meeting with the Queen, the couple’s spokesperson said they “can confirm that they visited the duke’s grandmother, as we previously said he hoped to do”. The couple did not bring their children, Archie, who will be three next month, and Lilibet, 10 months, who is named after the Queen but whom the monarch is yet to meet. The visit was hailed by one royal observer as a way of Harry slowly starting to rebuild some bridges with his father, of whom he has been critical in interviews. It is also seen as an “olive branch”, said another, after the bitterness of the Oprah Winfrey interview the couple gave, and the rockiness of their relationship with other members of the royal family since. For their part, the Queen, Charles, and William will be mindful that Harry’s much-publicised memoirs are due to be published this autumn. The Sussexes are understood to have stayed at their former marital home, Frogmore Cottage, on the Windsor estate, where Princess Eugenie and her family now live. They reportedly flew to the Netherlands after the visit, where they are due to appear at the Invictus Games, accompanied by a Netflix crew for a documentary, Heart of Invictus, as part of the couple’s $100m (£76.5m) deal with the streaming company. While there, they are said to have been accorded VVIP status and Dutch police protection. The duke has cited security fears in the UK as one reason he was unable to attend Philip’s memorial. He has launched a high court action against the Home Office claiming it is too dangerous to bring his family to the UK after being stripped of his official Metropolitan police protection, despite offering to pay privately for it. The couple’s brief return to the UK came as concerns continue over the Queen’s health. She is expected to miss Easter service and, since recovering from Covid in February, which she said left “one feeling very tired and exhausted”, has also been experiencing mobility issues.",News/UK news,Harry and Meghan ‘offer olive branch’ to Queen in low-key reunion,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/15/harry-meghan-olive-branch-queen-low-key-reunion
4/15/2022,"Russia has acknowledged that the Moskva, its flagship Black Sea missile cruiser, has sunk. It attributes the loss to an unexplained fire, which ignited ammunition, and says it capsized “in choppy seas” while being towed to port. Ukraine says it hit the Moskva with at least one of its Neptune anti-shipping missiles, and that this caused it to sink. The subsonic Neptune is based on the old Soviet Kh-35 anti-ship missile with improved range and electronics, and has a range of almost 200 miles. First coming into service in Ukraine last year, the whole system comprises a truck-based mobile launcher, four missiles, a reload vehicle, and a command and control vehicle. It is designed to fly close to the surface of the sea to avoid detection. The Neptune system is designed to be deployed from coastal areas, which in this case would mean it was being operated close to an area of intense Russian military activity. If the damage was caused by a Neptune missile, the Russians appear not to have been aware of it until too late. During the Falklands war in 1982, the British lost six ships, underlining to navies around the world the vulnerability of ships to missile attack. Slava class ships like the Moskva were designed to be equipped with with S-300F Fort long-range air defence system, a naval version of the S300, which has some utility against ballistic missiles. Modern naval forces would also be expected to be equipped with some kind of radar warning receiver system to alert it to the presence of enemy radar systems, although both are far from foolproof. One claim is that the missile or missiles were fired from a hidden battery close to Odesa while the Moskva’s crew was distracted by two Turkish-supplied drones operating nearby. Whatever the cause of the sinking, it is hard to see this as anything short of a pretty catastrophic incident for Russia. Naval vessels are designed to survive attack as much as possible. Bulkhead doors connecting different sections are intended to control the spread of fire and hull breaches can be isolated. Naval vessels also have a higher level of firefighting capability than civilian counterparts. The sinking of the Black Sea fleet’s flagship is certainly a coup for Ukrainian morale and a symbolic blow to Russia. However it is worth recalling that Ukraine scuttled its own flagship in port earlier in the conflict, and that British naval forces continued to operate effectively in the Falklands despite the loss of ships. And while significant, the sinking probably does not alter the Russian navy’s continuing and largely uncontested ability to blockade Ukraine’s coastline. The big question, however, is whether it could affect any future Russian move to land amphibious forces, perhaps as part of an assault on Odesa.",News/World news,"The sinking of the Moskva: what do we know, and why does it matter?

4/15/2022,"Some of the world’s most ancient buildings are being destroyed by climate change, as rising concentrations of salt in Iraq eat away at mud brick and more frequent sandstorms erode ancient wonders. Iraq is known as the cradle of civilisation. It was here that agriculture was born, some of the world’s oldest cities were built, such as the Sumerian capital Ur, and one of the first writing systems was developed – cuneiform. The country has “tens of thousands of sites from the Palaeolithic through Islamic eras”, explained Augusta McMahon, professor of Mesopotamian archaeology at the University of Cambridge. Damage to sites such as the legendary Babylon “will leave gaps in our knowledge of human evolution, of the development of early cities, of the management of empires, and of the dynamic changes in the political landscape of the Islamic era”, she added. Mesopotamia, the land between the two rivers of modern-day Iraq, is rich with salt (mun in Sumerian) that exists naturally in the soil and groundwater. Cuneiform texts mention the profession of a salt collector and describe the use of salt in everything from preserving food, to healthcare and rituals. There is a Sumerian proverb that says the basic necessities of life are bread and salt: “When a poor man has died, do not revive him. When he had bread, he had no salt. When he had salt, he had no bread.” Salt in the soil can aid archaeologists in some circumstances, but the same mineral can also be destructive, and is destroying heritage sites, according to the geoarchaeologist Jaafar Jotheri, who described salt as “aggressive … it will destroy the site – destroy the bricks, destroy the cuneiform tablets, destroy everything”. The destructive power of salt is increasing as concentrations rise amid water shortages caused by dams built upstream by Turkey and Iran, and years of mismanagement of water resources and agriculture within Iraq. “The salinity in Shatt al-Arab river started to increase from the 90s,” said Ahmad N A Hamdan, a civil engineer who studies the quality of the water in Iraq’s rivers. In his observations, the Shatt al-Arab – formed by the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates - annually tests poor or very poor quality, especially in 2018, which he called a “crisis” year when brackish water sent at least 118,000 people to hospital in southern Basra province during a drought. The climate crisis is adding to the problem. Iraq is getting hotter and dryer. The United Nations estimates that mean annual temperatures will rise by 2C by 2050 with more days of extreme temperatures of over 50C, while rainfall will drop by as much as 17% during the rainy season and the number of sand and dust storms will more than double from 120 per year to 300. Meanwhile, rising seawater is pushing a wedge of salt up into Iraq and in less than 30 years, parts of southern Iraq could be under water. “Imagine the next 10 years, most of our sites will be under saline water,” said Jotheri, a professor of archaeology at Al-Qadisiyah University and co-director of the Iraqi-British Nahrein Network researching Iraqi heritage. He started to notice damage from salt at historic sites about a decade ago. One spot suffering significant damage is Unesco-recognised Babylon, the capital of the Babylonian Empire, where a salty sheen coats 2,600-year-old mud bricks. In the Temple of Ishtar, the Sumerian goddess of love and war, the base of the walls are crumbling. In the depths of the thick wall, salt accumulates until it crystallises, cracking the bricks and causing them to break apart. Other sites that have been affected are Samarra, the Islamic-era capital with its spiral minaret that is being eroded by sandstorms, and Umm al-Aqarib with its White Temple, palace and cemetery that are being swallowed up by the desert. This year, Iraq lost a piece of its cultural heritage. On the edge of the desert, 150km south of Babylon, is a bed of salt that was once Sawa Lake. The spring-fed water was home to at least 31 species of bird, including the grey heron and the near-threatened ferruginous duck. Now, it is completely dry because of overuse of water by surrounding farms and climate change. Lack of enforcement of regulations over groundwater use means farmers can freely drill wells and plant wheat fields that are an eruption of lush green in the dusty desert landscape. “When I was a child I remembered that Sawa Lake was a big lake, a large lake. It looked like the sea. But now it’s gone. Totally gone. We don’t have any lake any more,” said Jotheri. Desert plants are growing where there once was water and Sawa is fated to become yet another source of sandstorms.",News/World news,Iraq’s ancient buildings are being destroyed by climate change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/15/iraq-ancient-buildings-destroyed-by-climate-change-salt-sandstorms
4/15/2022,"In early March, Watford fans might have marked this fixture as a crucial winnable game to save their season. That was until Christian Eriksen lifted Brentford to another level. Roy Hodgson’s side desperately need a win as they sit seven points from the last safe spot but the gap is only likely to grow this weekend. Brentford are the form team outside the top four and are fresh from successive wins against Chelsea and West Ham. Thomas Frank’s side looked like relegation contenders but now will have their sights set on an outstanding and more than achievable top-half finish.
