2/4/2022,"Ralf Rangnick has acknowledged that Mason Greenwood’s arrest was discussed by Manchester United players but said the squad had trained well this week. Greenwood was arrested on Sunday on suspicion of rape and assault and further arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of sexual assault and making threats to kill. The forward was released on bail on Wednesday. He remains under investigation and is suspended from training and playing for United until further notice.  Rangnick, whose team host Middlesbrough in Friday’s fourth-round FA Cup tie, was asked whether this had been a difficult few days because of the situation with Greenwood. “In fact, we had a normal week of training with five training sessions including today’s training,” the interim manager said. “Obviously it was a topic within the team but they’re human beings and Mason was part of the group before we had our [winter] break. We are looking forward to the game tomorrow.” Rangnick said that Jesse Lingard staying rather than leaving on loan was due partly to Greenwood’s unavailability. “In a way, yes,” he said. “We had a problem with Mason Greenwood and being without a player for the time being who has played in [recent] weeks and, together with the club not finding an agreement with another club [for Lingard], this is why he stayed. Three weeks ago Jesse didn’t want to leave, then changed his mind.” Lingard, who is unhappy at not going on loan, has requested time off. “Jesse asked if we could give him a couple of days to clear his mind,” Rangnick said. “He will be back in training on Monday and part of the squad.” Paul Pogba may start against Middlesbrough after recovering from a calf injury that has ruled out the midfielder for three months. “He might be in the XI,” said Rangnick. “Edi Cavani will only return at the weekend. He asked to have two more days at home – I knew he couldn’t be in the XI with jet lag [after playing for Uruguay]. Victor Lindelöf has been ill the whole week and not training. Eric Bailly came back yesterday, he has some problems with his ankle and will not be part of the squad. Luke [Shaw] will play because Alex Telles played 90 minutes for Brazil.” Rangnick was asked about his future as reports continue to suggest Paris Saint-Germain’s Mauricio Pochettino is the favourite to be recruited for the United manager’s job in the summer. “I have no idea,” he said. “My full focus is on training the group right now. We have games coming up in three different competitions.”",Sport/Football,Ralf Rangnick: players talking about Greenwood but training has been good,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/03/ralf-rangnick-manchester-united-players-talking-about-mason-greenwood-but-training-has-been-good
2/4/2022,"Competing mediation offers showered down on the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on Thursday as the Russian defence minister visited troops on the Ukraine border before unprecedented joint exercises with Belarus, due to start in a week’s time. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, on a trip to Kyiv, offered to host talks between Ukraine and Russia. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, prepared a fourth phone call in a week with Putin, and the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said he was planning a trip to Moscow.  Moscow confirmed it was possible that Scholz and Macron would travel to Moscow together, as a symbol of European unity and as joint signatories to the Minsk Agreements, the stalled 2015 agreement designed to bring peace and autonomy to Russian-supporting eastern Ukraine. Macron is de facto becoming the chief interlocutor for Putin in Europe, coordinating closely with Washington and Warsaw. The frenetic diplomatic activity came as Russia accused the US of ratcheting up “tensions” by sending 1,000 soldiers to Romania and 2,000 to Poland to bolster Nato’s eastern flank. Moscow is refusing to pull back more than 100,000 troops from Ukraine’s borders, and said its security demands have not yet been addressed by Nato. Erdoğan’s efforts to become the lead mediator are likely to be rejected by Moscow. Putin has been angered by Ankara’s decision to sell drones to Ukraine for use in eastern Ukraine, as well by a new offer to build a Turkish drone manufacturing plant in Ukraine. Turkey said that, as a Nato member, it was legitimate to provide weapons against a country that might threaten other Nato states in eastern Europe. “Military cooperation between Ankara and Kyiv is not intended to target Russia and won’t be disrupted in order to please it,” a senior Turkish presidential official said. The Kremlin urged the US to “stop escalating tensions” after the deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko, warned the “destructive” move would make it harder for a compromise between the two sides. The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, was in Belarus inspecting plans for a massive joint drill planned for between 10 and 20 February between Belarus and Russia Putin has demanded guarantees that Ukraine will never join Nato, and that offensive missiles will be removed from states close to Russian borders. The Kremlin also claimed it had China’s support in the standoff, backing that would be demonstrated when Putin met President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Friday at the opening of the Olympics. Alongside the frenetic diplomacy, Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, tried on Thursday to cool the temperature, saying that “the probability of a significant escalation as of today is considered low” as Kyiv had not seen Moscow move “strike groups” to the border. In a change of language, responding to Ukrainian concerns, the White House said on Wednesday that it would no longer refer to a Russian invasion of Ukraine as “imminent”, saying the word implied Putin had already made a decision to attack. France also said its offer to send troops to Romania among wider plans to bolster Nato’s ranks on the eastern flank was designed to de-escalate the crisis, rather than provoke Russia. The French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, speaking alongside his Romanian counterpart, said: “I don’t think one can say this is a provocation, to respond to the commitments we have in the framework of Nato. The fundamental subject now is to defuse tensions as quickly as possible and to do that you dissuade and discuss.” The Romanian foreign minister, Bogdan Aurescu, said: “It must be said very clearly, if you compare the allied presence on the eastern flank to the troops Russia has massed, it is several times smaller so there is no question of an attempt to escalate tensions,”. The two ministers were also meeting foreign ministers from the Baltic states and eastern Europe. Lithuania is pressing Germany as the Nato battlegroup leader to increase its troop commitments in Lithuania. Germany currently has 550 soldiers stationed in Lithuania as part of the 1,200-strong battlegroup. There are unresolved divisions within the EU, especially between Poland and Hungary, over the nature of the sanctions that need to be imposed in the event of a Russian invasion, as well as how to protect European energy needs. Le Drian, in a sign of Franco-German solidarity, is due to fly to the frontline in eastern Ukraine on Friday in the company of the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock.",News/World news,"France, Germany and Turkey reach out to Putin as troops remain on Ukraine border",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/03/france-germany-and-turkey-reach-out-to-putin-as-troops-remain-on-ukraine-border
2/4/2022,"At its most crude, it means security should be seen as a collective concept so if the actions of one state threaten the security of another, the principle of indivisible security is breached. Therefore no state should strengthen its security at the expense of another.  The principle was first set out in the 1975 Helsinki Act, but also appears in the 1990 Charter for a New Europe and in the 1997 Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security – all treaties signed by the west and Russia. In Russia’s eyes, indivisible security lies at the heart of the Ukraine crisis because it thinks Nato’s expansion threatens its own security. The term provides the strategic underpinning for the Russian demand that Nato withdraw from central and eastern Europe. It has featured in all major Russian strategic documents since 1990. The subject was brought up by Vladimir Putin in his phone call with Boris Johnson on Wednesday, and appears in the two drafttreaty documents published by Russia in mid-December. It was also the focus of a written message sent by the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, on 28 January to Nato. Russia argues that Nato runs an open-door policy on expansion because only it and applicant states decide if applications should be accepted. The views of the states remaining outside the bloc are legitimate, says Russia, and need to be taken into account. Russia says yes. It relies mostly on two Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) documents to promote its version of indivisible security: the European Security Charter, signed in Istanbul in November 1999, and the Astana Declaration of December 2010. The US is a signatory to both documents. The Istanbul charter says countries should be free to choose their own security arrangements and alliances, but adds the rider that they “will not strengthen their security at the expense of the security of other states”. The Russian government has accused the US state department of selectively picking out from a “package of interconnected commitments” only those elements that serve its purpose. The underlying principle, according to Russia, is that if some countries coexist in a particular region, they are supposed to have common security interests. Consequently, they need inclusive international platforms to communicate. It says the Istanbul document explicitly affirmed the inherent right of nation states to choose their security alliances. It did not provide a right of veto to Russia. It points out that the OSCE documents to which Russia signed, including the 1990 Paris Charter, also presumed an adherence to human rights and democracy. The west says it is an abuse of the indivisible security concept, and a violation of the spirit of the Helsinki Final Act if Russia insists on decoupling security issues from human rights. Yes, and no. In wars, casus belli matter as much as tank formations. They can in theory also matter in international law. If the two sides could come to a collective understanding of its practical application, it might help. On the other hand, this is only the language through which a dispute about power and values is conducted. Moreover, perceptions of security and threat are highly subjective, with one person’s security being another’s insecurity.",News/World news,Why does Russia focus on ‘indivisible security’ in Ukraine standoff?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/03/why-does-russia-focus-on-indivisible-security-in-ukraine-standoff
2/4/2022,"Hello Fight to Vote readers, For the last few months, I’ve been following the case of Pamela Moses, a 44-year-old activist in Memphis who was convicted in November for trying to register to vote while she was ineligible. On Monday, Moses, who is Black, was sentenced to six years and one day in prison.  To my eye, the case is far more complex than it seems. Amy Weirich, the local prosecutor, has trumpeted both the conviction and the sentence in press releases. She has highlighted that Moses has an extensive criminal record, and she told a straightforward story about Moses’ voting crime. In 2015, Moses pleaded guilty to perjury and tampering with evidence in connection to allegations that she stalked and harassed a local judge. Tampering with evidence is one of a handful of felonies that causes someone to permanently lose their voting rights in Tennessee. Nonetheless, Moses, still on probation, knowingly tried to register to vote in 2019. The case caught my attention for a few reasons. First, it is rare to see a prosecutor bring criminal charges against someone for election crimes, and I was curious whether this was a bona fide case of fraud or of someone who had made a mistake. Second, there has been growing awareness of racial disparities in punishments for election-related crimes. Black people such as Crystal Mason and Hervis Rogers have faced years in prison for making mistakes about their voting eligibility. White voters have received much lighter sentences for election-related crimes. Weirich’s office did not respond to interview requests, but the more I looked into Moses’ case, the more I realized the case wasn’t straightforward at all. Behind the scenes, Tennessee officials conceded that they had made a series of mistakes concerning Moses’ voting eligibility. In 2015, when Moses pleaded guilty to her felony, she says no one told her she couldn’t vote. “They never mentioned anything about voting. They never mentioned anything about not voting, being able to vote … none of that,” Moses told me last year. (She added she hadn’t discussed the case with her two sons, 24 and 13, but described it as “traumatic”.) At the time, election officials should have removed her from the rolls, but the court never sent election officials in Memphis the documents they needed to do so, according to a letter from an election official I obtained. Moses didn’t know anything was amiss until 2019, when she launched a long-shot mayoral campaign. Election officials said she couldn’t appear on the ballot because of her felony. When they began to look into her eligibility, they also realized she had never been taken off the voter rolls. Moses went to court and asked a judge to clarify whether she was still on probation, and the court confirmed that she was. What happened next is at the crux of the case against her. Moses did not believe the judge had correctly calculated her sentence. So she went to the local probation office and asked an officer to figure it out. An officer filled out and signed a certificate confirming her probation had ended. In Tennessee, people with felony convictions who want to vote need that document from a correction official. Moses submitted it to local election officials along with a voter registration form. But the day afterwards, an official at the corrections department wrote an email to election officials saying a probation officer had made an “error” on Moses’ certificate. Moses was still serving an active felony sentence, they wrote, and was not eligible to vote. The department offered no explanation for the mistake. Such errors are actually fairly common in Tennessee, where the voting rules are extremely confusing for people with felonies, Blair Bowie, an attorney at the Campaign Legal Center, told me. A 2017 study found that about 8% of the certificates submitted were rejected because the voters remained ineligible. Bowie said she was unaware of any voter in the state ever facing criminal charges for submitting a certificate but later turning out to be ineligible to vote. During Moses’ trial, prosecutors argued that she knew she was ineligible to vote when she submitted the certificate. They pointed to the fact that she submitted it even though a judge had recently told her she was ineligible. “Even knowing that order denied her expiration of sentence, Pamela Moses submitted that form with her application for voter registration and signed an oath as to the accuracy of the information submitted,” prosecutors wrote in their request for an indictment. “Pamela Moses knowingly made or consented to a false entry on her permanent registration.” “You tricked the probation department into giving you documents saying you were off probation,” the judge sentencing her said last week. “That seems absurd to me on its face,” said Bowie, who is involved in a challenge to Tennessee’s process for restoring voting rights. “The instructions on the certificate of restoration form are very clear to the probation officer or the clerk. They say you will check these records and you will sign off on this based on what the records say. “They’re saying that she tricked the probation officer into filling out this form for her. That creates a really scary prospect for people who think they’re being wrongly told they’re not eligible.” Moses is currently in custody and an appeal is expected. But the case highlights the byzantine maze that people with felony convictions have to go through to figure out if they can vote. And it shows the harsh consequences prosecutors can bring if people with felony convictions make a mistake. New York Democrats are pushing ahead with new congressional maps that would tilt future elections in their favor. Texas faces a “clusterfuck” as it tries to implement a sweeping new voting law ahead of its 1 March midterm elections. A bipartisan group of senators is making progress in a proposal to reform the Electoral Count Act, a confusing 19th-century law that governs how votes from the electoral college are counted. Trump planned to rely on ambiguities in the law as part of his efforts to overturn the election.",News/US news,The Black woman sentenced to six years in prison over a voting error,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/03/fight-to-vote-tennessee-pamela-moses-convicted
2/4/2022,"It is now more than 50 years since I first wrestled with the restructuring of local government. After the Conservatives won the 1970 general election, I was sidekick to Peter Walker, secretary of state for the newly created Department of the Environment, and our attempts to change things faced entrenched resistance. It would be understandable, therefore, if I were to say that I know where the bodies are buried. Michael Gove’s new white paper on “levelling up” makes it clear that, far from being buried, the bodies are alive and very much kicking.  In the white paper, Gove has proposed cautious, evolutionary moves towards greater devolution, achieved by agreement. I cannot criticise him for this. Time and again I faced the same pressures, and was able to persuade colleagues to accept only partial and gradual shifts in the status quo. The objections came from all directions. The Treasury wants to maintain its tenacious grip on expenditure. The Whitehall barons fight to preserve their functional powers. Local councillors resist the abolition of their jobs, and members of parliament are deeply suspicious of change that creates local figures more powerful than them and deprives them of the foot soldiers they need to hold their seats. In the 1970s, we tried and failed to bring in a proposal commissioned by Labour from John Redcliffe-Maud. He suggested replacing the existing 1,300 authorities, many of which reflected an England where the only means of transport were by foot, cart or horse, with 60 unitary authorities and metropolitan authorities covering the larger conurbations. Peter Walker found a compromise that reduced the number of authorities to just over 300 by introducing a two-tier structure based on counties and districts, while accepting Maud’s proposal for metro councils in the metropolitan areas. The metro councils were deeply controversial because the prosperous Tory fringes feared the Labour heartlands, and to my discredit I abolished rather than reformed them as environment minister in the 1980s. In mitigation, I helped George Osborne and Greg Clark when they pioneered the recreation of metro authorities with elected mayors in several of our major cities. (London had already achieved this under Tony Blair, whose government had used legislation I enacted to enable a small number of county councils to opt for unitary status.) It is a major failure of public policy that well over half a century after Maud we are still left with an expensive, multitiered local administrative machine. It is against this backdrop that Gove inherited responsibility for the devolution agenda and the drive to level up the less prosperous parts of the country. Gove cannot be held responsible for the delay, and he is right to make clear that there are no short-term fixes. Regeneration is a long-term process, and he is right to recognise the role of central government in bringing it about. He is also right to chair a committee of the relevant ministers to drive the agenda. I walked the streets of Liverpool for three weeks after the 1981 riots. It changed my understanding of public administration beyond recognition. He should hypothecate a minister to each conurbation authority and insist they have regular dialogue with the mayor and other influential local people in both public and private sectors. Another wise move is the recreation of the old government offices in each region to coordinate central government’s interactions with the mayoral authorities. These will be chaired by levelling-up directors who will replace the old regional directors that disappeared under the coalition government. I hope that Gove will take a personal interest in these appointments. They are a critical building block in any devolution plan, as a partnership of trust is a must. He may wish to seek some appointments from outside the public sector to bring entrepreneurial experience to the task. Considering the constraints at play, there is much to welcome in the white paper. Three mayoral authorities, West Midlands, Manchester and Glasgow, have been invited to negotiate more comprehensive deals. There is a clear indication that this is a path others will be able to follow. The paper also sets out a range of incentives to encourage a list of authorities to negotiate new mayoral deals. I hope they will – though the risk is that local pressures will drive councillors to opt for one of the lesser options tabulated in the document. An observer could very well ask what the point of all this is. The answer is set out in the white paper’s 12 mission statements that cover virtually every aspect of modern life. Machinery is to be put in place to monitor progress against targets set for each of these criteria. A quango is to be set up to report on the facts. Joint select committees of both houses of parliament should keep close to this process. I tried something similar in the 1990s with my white paper on competitiveness. It provided an invaluable source of criticism for the opposition. Annual comparative statistics tend not to survive long in the heat of party politics. It is inevitable that the first question many will pose in response to the white paper is how much more money is promised. But it is the wrong question. Huge capital programmes flow into every part of our country every year. The right question is how relevant are these sums to the needs and priorities of local opportunities. The white paper reveals the problem by endless reference to existing budgets. These are all programmes designed in Whitehall to fit the functional judgments of individual spending departments – they are not designed to reflect Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle or anywhere else. Devolution is about replacing the myriad different funds with a single fund to finance strategies devised and led by local mayors that best reflect the circumstances of each local economy and attract the largest additional expenditure. The next great task for Gove is to add a sense of urgency to the good intentions outlined in the white paper. Why not invite each of the metro mayors to separate meetings with Gove’s committee to outline individual programmes for each area? The public is more than capable of judging who simply uses the occasion to play party politics. The outstanding quality of Andy Street in the West Midlands and Ben Houchen on Teesside ensures the government has everything to gain.

2/4/2022,"Just a few minutes into Channel 4’s new comedy drama The Curse, the narrator informs us that a chain of events has been set in motion and every character but her will die. You don’t exactly have to be a comedy expert to know that stark reminders of humankind’s futile impermanence don’t traditionally get bums on seats, but that’s the kind of show The Curse is. Set in London’s East End in the 1980s, the series follows a clutch of hapless would-be gangsters who find themselves dropped into a world of trouble when a small-time robbery ends with an accidental haul of gold bullion. It’s narratively tight and extremely gripping, but also finds plenty of pockets of loose, knockabout comedy. As with Only Murders in the Building before it, it’s a balancing act that seems unlikely to work, yet manages to hit the sweet spot over and over again.  The Curse was created in part by Steve Stamp, Allan Mustafa and Hugo Chegwin, who were three-quarters of the brain trust behind the BBC Three breakout People Just Do Nothing. That show was a funny, silly, wonderfully observed sitcom that, by design, didn’t really go anywhere. But this? This claps along like an airport paperback. “It just feels like we were all at that point in our careers where we wanted to make something that felt like a level up, something different and unexpected,” says Stamp, speaking over Zoom from his kitchen, a long row of trainers neatly leading out to his front door. Mustafa, joining in on the chat from his own kitchen, where an unopened subscription box of smoothies is balanced on the worktop behind him, can’t hide his excitement about how different it is to his last show. “This is the first time we’ve done something that looks more stylised, like a film,” he says. “The kid in me keeps going: ‘Shit! It actually looks like a proper thing!’” Meanwhile, Chegwin – calling in separately during a break from filming – has a simpler reason to appreciate The Curse. “My dad loves it, so that’s the main thing,” he explains. “He doesn’t really show emotions, and he did to this.” Which brings us to the rest of the creative team: Tom Davis and James De Frond, the pair behind Murder in Successville and King Gary. Figuring out how this comedy supergroup came to be took some heavy interrogation – there is lots of hazy talk from all involved about meeting at a nebulous industry awards show – but the genesis of The Curse seems to be a pitch that Chegwin had about an aspiring screenwriter hiding in the witness protection scheme. “It was crap,” he repeatedly assures me. But Mustafa urged him to take the idea to Davis and De Frond. “And then they were like, ‘Actually, we’ve got this idea,’ which is effectively The Curse, and said, ‘We’d like to try to develop it collectively.’” The charming thing about this collaboration is that both ends seem to think they’ve got the better deal. The People Just Do Nothing contingent are all clearly beside themselves that a heavyweight like Davis would pick them to work with, while Davis can’t believe his luck that they actually agreed. “They’re a phenomenal bunch of boys,” says Davis, smiling, in what is either a large spare room or a small warehouse. “I was dying to work with them from the moment I saw People Just Do Nothing. And I think that it’s quite underestimated how much of an influence they’ve had on the world of comedy. That show, I think, speaks out to a generation.” The key bonding element, Davis believes, is that they have all made it up the ladder without the traditional privileges. “[We] have very similar backgrounds to each other, but didn’t come through the normal sort of Oxbridge world,” he explains. “I think, weirdly, you can see it in the show and in the writing – it’s that underdog spirit.” I admit to them all that I’m fascinated by such a sprawling collaboration. To me, it seems like it has the potential to be a minefield of ego and compromise. As they explain it, it seems as though the success of The Curse is down to its unhurried development – Davis estimates that it took four years to get it to our screens – and also the ease with which everyone found their roles in the collective. “James [De Frond] and Steve [Stamp] are kind of like the puzzle masters,” says Chegwin. “They look at it from a real deep way. Like, they’re super-funny and super-creative and imaginative, but they put the puzzle together really well in terms of structure and things.” “Having the director as a writer is amazing,” says Stamp of De Frond. “James led most of the writing. He also kept all of the notes of the scripts as we were going through them, which was nice for me because I’ve never had that before, really.” “He’s the dad,” Mustafa adds. “And Tom [Davis], he comes out with the maddest stuff,” says Stamp. “He’ll just throw in a whole new backstory for his character, where he’s dating a 7ft woman or whatever. And it’s like: ‘Where has this come from?’” “We all have the same end goal, which is to make it as good and as funny as it can possibly be,” continues Chegwin. “And if it doesn’t make sense or it doesn’t work, there’s no ego in the room; there’s no like, ‘Oh no, my idea must be in there,’ or anything like that. It’s all love.” On top of everything else, The Curse feels like an authentic period piece, set in the 1980s but – as with real life – the characters’ clothes and music tastes lagging a few years behind. I ask Mustafa if it was hard finding pockets of the old tumbledown East End, given London’s identikit gentrification. “We actually filmed it in Liverpool,” he tells me. “There’s just so many amazing locations there. You’ve got the docks, you’ve got the arches. Even just the fact that they’ve got so many old, derelict buildings. Our cafe set wasn’t a studio; it was just a real old cafe that we recreated as an even older cafe.” The choice of era, the creators explain, was partly down to necessity. In an age where Line of Duty has taught everyone that CCTV, trace DNA and mobile data mean that nobody can ever get away with anything, small-time crooks like these would be banged up in an instant. But 40 years ago that simply wasn’t the case. “When police were going off just chatting to the locals, you could get away with more crime,” explains Mustafa with a grin. “Also, Tom and James are really old and they were about in the 80s. Put that in there.” The key to getting The Curse right, Davis explains, was to make the characters peripheral to the gangland crime of the time. “Everyone, in that time and in that world, was probably always just rubbing up against guys that you might have gone to school with, who are embedded into that criminal world,” he says. “But you have to then make them lovable and you have to make the odds against them.” Like all good gangster stories, The Curse doesn’t really get going until after the robbery itself, when everyone is left to figure out the consequences of their actions. “You’ve got all this fucking gold; what are you going to do with it?” Davis says. “And also, how are you going to handle that? How’s it going to change you? From episode three, they’re hanging on to their sensibilities and the friendship, but the rope is starting to fray. And, I think for four, five, six, it’s a case of ‘be careful what you wish for’, because everybody will come and bite you in the arse.” Given its filmic nature, and its doomy opening prophecy, I had assumed that The Curse was designed as a one-season wonder: a confidently told story with everything aimed at a finish line. Apparently, though, this isn’t the case. “There is a finish line in the sense that some of the characters are going to die,” says Stamp. “But you don’t know how long that timescale is, basically. In an ideal world, we want to take it to the next decade, so it’ll be the 90s. There’s a lot of stuff around where that gold ended up, and what it helped to create. The drug scene in the 90s was very tied up in that gold’s journey.” “There’s a long way to go in the gold’s journey,” says Mustafa, “but I guess let’s see.” Hugo Chegwin, on the other hand, seems less bothered about the future. The Curse is already a victory for him. “I think my dad loves me now,” he gasps over the phone. “Just took him 36 years, but that’s cool.”",Arts/Television & radio,A comedy supergroup is born!

2/4/2022,"For Hurricane Katrina survivors in the Lower Ninth Ward, it had seemed like a prayer answered: in 2006, Brad Pitt announced an initiative to rebuild New Orleans’ storm-ravaged Lower Ninth Ward with sustainable, flood-proof, affordable homes, designed by a list of A-list architects. The 109 homes on offer would give many survivors a chance to become first-time homeowners, and bring back a community devastated by the hurricane. But not even a decade after the homes were completed to great fanfare – including a star-studded gala hosted by Ellen DeGeneres – that dream has become a curse, as many of the residents’ homes have decayed to unlivable conditions. The houses now list a frightening array of defects: water intrusion, black mold, porches rotted through, stair rails collapsing, fires caused by electrical problems, plumbing problems and poor ventilation, according to a class-action lawsuit filed against Pitt and his charity by some of the remaining residents. Other residents have reported termite infestations, and multiple residents have fallen sick.  Judith Keller, an urban studies academic who stayed in one of Pitt’s houses as part of her research on the failed development in 2018, returned recently to find things had gotten far worse: “Although some of these structures are not yet a decade old, my data shows only six remain in reasonably good shape,” she wrote in her research report. After one house was demolished in 2018 for severe mold problems, another was torn down last year for the same reason. Of the remaining homes, six have been boarded up and abandoned since the first residents moved in. “I was just shocked at how that project had deteriorated over the past three years,” Keller told the Guardian. “The problems that existed in 2018 are all getting worse because there’s no one there to fix stuff.” And many of the homeowners don’t have the resources to make the necessary repairs on their own. It was supposed to turn out differently. The non-profit project, called Make It Right, was launched by Brad Pitt in the wake of Hurricane Katrina’s devastation, to ample hype. Lavish fundraisers drew the support of luminaries from Snoop Dogg to Bill Clinton, raising millions of dollars – including a claimed $5m from Pitt himself, who lived part-time in New Orleans with his then wife, Angelina Jolie. The project seemed cutting-edge, if not utopian. Architects like Frank Gehry, David Adjaye and Shigeru Ban helped design the houses, which incorporated next-gen features like solar panel roofs, energy-efficient heating and cooling, and sustainable materials. And each house would be sold well below cost: $150,000. As Pitt boasted in 2010: “We’re cracking the code on affordable green homes.” He called the rebuilt Lower Ninth “a ‘proof-of-concept’ for low-income green building nationally, maybe even worldwide”. Keller said residents were initially “starstruck” by Pitt, and excited to become homeowners. And at first, everything seemed fine. But almost as soon as the camera crews left and they began settling in, the issues became apparent. Some houses had flat roofs and lacked basic features like rain gutters, overhangs, covered beams, or waterproof paint to weather New Orleans’ torrential downpours. Within weeks, houses began to develop mold, leaks and rot. Pitt’s non-profit initially made some minor repairs, but then began pushing residents to sign non-disclosure agreements before it would tell them what was wrong with their homes. “That’s when a lot of residents started to notice that things were very fishy.” By 2014, it became clear that the buildings were actively falling apart, with reports that the glass-infused wood was “rotting from the inside out”. But without correcting the issue, Pitt continued to call the project a success – telling local media in August 2016: “I’ll tell you, every time I drive over the Claiborne bridge, no matter what frustration I might be dealing with at the moment, I get this well of pride when I see this little oasis of color and the solar panels.” That was the last time he would publicly mention Make It Right. The next month, he and Angelina Jolie divorced, and soon the pair had sold their New Orleans mansion. Then Make It Right vanished. Its website stopped updating – and later was replaced by a blank page. The office stopped picking up the phone. “Everyone from Make It Right has more or less disappeared,” said Keller, who said she had tried every method to contact the organization, with no luck since she began her research. With no one to turn to, the residents have been stuck. In 2018, as their houses continued to crumble, some residents filed a class-action lawsuit against Pitt and Make It Right, citing “significant mental distress” and “financial loss”, and noting in their petition that “despite months and/or years of multiple requests, the defendants have failed to ‘make it right’”. “This was, in most cases, a one-shot deal at home ownership for these people,” said Ron Austin, an attorney representing the residents. He told the Guardian some residents had spent their life savings on their Make It Right home. “Without some financial relief, these people will literally be left holding nothing.” The lawyer added that many of the residents are still fans of Brad Pitt. “It’s unbelievable. To this day, their homes are falling down around them, and they love the man. But they just can’t believe the betrayal.” Pitt has denied responsibility. A source close to Pitt told the Guardian, “Brad got involved at the beginning to help the people of the Lower Ninth Ward, and obviously it was upsetting to see what had happened once he had stepped back from the project and others took over,” the source said. Althougha judge refused a petition from Brad Pitt to remove himself from the lawsuit in 2019, the source also denied Pitt’s legal culpability for the houses. “His attorneys have made it clear that he has no legal liability for the decisions made by others. He remains personally committed to doing whatever he can to helping resolve the ongoing litigation. It was always something that was important to him from the beginning and he very much wants to help facilitate this getting to a much more positive end,” the source said. Make It Right has filed cross-claims of its own, suing its lumber supplier, head architect and executive director – blaming them for the project’s failure, and estimating that the flawed constructions would cost $20m to repair. Last year, Make It Right was hit by more lawsuits: from a local bank, and even a lawnmower who said he was owed thousands of dollars in unpaid wages. Keller believes Brad Pitt had good intentions. But she said the debacle had shown how celebrities like him can evade accountability, and what can go wrong when a state entrusts private individuals, or non-profit groups, to solve its housing problems. “Usually [nonprofits] step in to help in case of an emergency. But now their own project is the emergency,” she said. “And the city doesn’t really take any responsibility, either.” She thinks the Hollywood star needs to own up to his mistakes, and fix them. “That’s all I think the residents want. They don’t need a fake reconciliation, they don’t have to be best friends with Brad Pitt. They just want the problems in their homes taken care of.”",News/US news,"Mold, leaks, rot: how Brad Pitt’s post-Katrina housing project went horribly wrong",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/03/brad-pitt-post-katrina-housing-project-went-horribly-wrong
2/4/2022,"Why did the chicken cross the road? To break into the Pentagon, apparently. Or is it now the Hentagon – and is America about to have a new peck-retary of defense? A wandering chicken was caught sneaking around a security area at the Pentagon this week, a local animal welfare organization said.  The hen was found running loose early Monday morning near the US Department of Defense headquarters on the outskirts of Washington DC, the Animal Welfare League of Arlington, Virginia wrote on social media. “Apparently, the answer to ‘why did the chicken cross the road’ is to get to the Pentagon,” the group posted. The chicken was taken into custody by one of the league’s employees. Chelsea Jones, a spokesperson for the organization, said in an email that she couldn’t reveal the precise location where the bird was spotted. “We are not allowed to disclose exactly where she was found,” Jones said. “We can only say it was at a security checkpoint.” It’s also unclear where the chicken came from or how she got to the Pentagon. The hen – which has brown feathers and a red comb and wattles – is a Rhode Island red. Jones described the bird as “sweet” and “nervous” but said the animal has permitted some people to pet her. The Animal Welfare League asked people online for name suggestions, prompting various creative responses. “I mean, chicken found on the military installation … I suggest Colonel Sanderson,” one user wrote. Another said, “Chick Cheney, after the former Defense Secretary and VP.” “Hentagon!” someone else wrote. Similarly, another user said, “Henrietta Kissinger?” in reference to Henry Kissinger, a former secretary of state. “It’s probably not a joke that this chicken will prompt Congress to increase Department of Defense spending by $12 billion,” tweeted Martin Austermuhle, a web and radio producer for WAMU 88.5.

2/4/2022,"At 11am the regulator Ofgem put up the cost of the average energy bill by £700 a year. At noon the Bank of England raised interest rates for the second time running and warned of rapidly rising inflation. Sandwiched in between these two cost of living bombshells, Rishi Sunak popped up in the Commons with the government’s attempt at damage limitation. The chancellor said his £9bn package would take the sting out a rise in energy bills made inevitable by the rising global price of gas. Even so, the Treasury measures will cover only half the expected increases looming in April. All households will be worse off, with charities warning more children in Britain’s poorer households will go hungry as a result.  Sunak announced that every household in England, Scotland and Wales would receive a £200 discount off their bills in October. This, though, is intended to be a temporary respite because the money will be clawed back at the rate of £40 a year from 2023 onwards. That assumes wholesale energy prices come down in the intervening period, which – as Sunak acknowledges – is by no means guaranteed. As things stand, the price cap is on course to rise by a further £200-£300 in October. The other main measure was the £150 rebate from council tax bills in homes in bands A to D in England, with the Treasury making money available for the devolved administrations to cut bills by similar amounts. Sunak says 80% of households in England will benefit, although because council tax bands have remained unchanged for more than 30 years, plenty of relatively well-off people in London and the south-east will benefit because they live in homes in the A to D bands. There were alternatives. The government could have raised universal credit or increased the generosity of the warm homes discount but chose not to do so. Given its current political problems the government was keen to offer support to more than the neediest households but, as a result, the package attracted criticism for not being generous enough and for not targeting enough support at those who will need it most in what will be a dire year for living standards. The fear that the spring of 2022 will represent a “perfect storm” for the cost of living was sharpened by the latest upward move in interest rates from the Bank of England. It wasn’t simply that Threadneedle Street’s monetary policy committee voted to raise borrowing costs, it was that four of the nine members considered a quarter-point rise to 0.5% insufficient to head off inflationary pressures and wanted a half-point increase instead. Sunak began his statement to MPs by boasting about how well the economy was doing, citing falling unemployment and the reduction in government borrowing. An altogether gloomier picture was painted by the Bank, which expects the annual inflation rate to peak at more than 7% in April, and for the bounce-back from the plan B Covid restrictions to be followed by a marked slowdown in the economy. The UK faces a triple whammy over the coming months: businesses and mortgage payers paying higher interest rates; prices rising faster than wages; and more expensive energy costs. Sunak’s package will ease the squeeze – but not by much.",News/Business,Sunak attempts to ease cost of living squeeze as interest rates climb,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/03/sunak-cost-of-living-interest-rates-chancellor-economic-uk
2/4/2022,"In the end, after I had climbed out on to the narrow window ledge yet again, my mum tied the bedroom windows shut with shoelaces, knotted over and over and tugged tight. Even at that young age – just six or seven – I knew, standing in the window, that if I stepped a foot off, I wouldn’t fly. I would fall. And if that meant dying, there on the grass below, that was OK. Other times it wasn’t quite so passive; I actively craved it.  I know. It’s uncomfortable to talk about, write about, read about suicidal ideation in a child. Did I fully understand what dying would mean? Probably not. Could I have truly had intent? Who can say for sure. But still, it remains devastating to me, 35 years later, to acknowledge those thoughts I had. When most kids were thinking about whether they’d be allowed out on their BMX or what they were having for tea or if they’d see their pal at school tomorrow. And it wasn’t just the shadow of suicide: I scratched up my arms; twisted, pinched and punched my skin. I became obsessed with, and catastrophised about Aids, UFOs and nuclear war. I had recurring nightmares where the walls swelled and loomed and closed in on me until I was trapped and dying and dead. I suffered with what I now know were panic attacks. I stuttered and stammered. I wet my pants in the daytime and my bed at night, the alarm on the special blanket meant to deter me ringing out loud, wrenching me from sleep. There was no mystery for me then about what I was escaping on that ledge. After experiencing both sexual and physical violence in the very place I should have felt safest, at home, I felt nothing but fear, constantly. A brutal, ice-cold terror that back then could cause me to vomit and even now spins my stomach in a second. And sadly, there wasn’t just one man, one pair of fists that cracked open our house and the family trying to shelter within it. At the time, the only thing that truly mattered was survival. Getting through it, getting out of it, in one piece. But now, decades on, it’s clear to me that I needed professional help and support – counselling and therapy. The chance to start working through what had happened to my body and my mind. But apart from one single family therapy session after I broke down at school, that support wasn’t offered. Instead, I buried my memories, my hurt. Whenever it tried to surface, I’d dig the hole deeper. And as I became an adult, I realised I needed more help keeping it below ground, seeking assistance from booze, pills, bad relationships and self-harming. By the time I overdosed in New York, where I was living and working, eight years ago, it was clear that my almost three-decade strategy wasn’t working. And that surviving by my fingertips wasn’t enough. I engaged for the first time – properly – with professional services and started work that I continue with today. That was the 1980s. You might say of my childhood, things will have changed now for kids, surely. But that’s not necessarily true. It was only last week that children were finally officially recognised as victims of domestic abuse in their own right (as part of the Domestic Abuse Act). Specialist support services for them are inconsistent and in many senses a lottery. Of 30 local authorities surveyed by Action for Children in 2019, kids faced barriers accessing support in at least two-thirds of them. In over 10%, there were no support services available at all. Domestic abuse involving children has only worsened in recent years and especially since the pandemic – government data shows that last year, police made on average 669 child protection referrals a day for domestic abuse to social services across England and Wales. The NSPCC reported a massive leap of 35% in calls to its helpline about children living in violent homes. Yet this is still probably just the tip of the iceberg, with untold numbers of kids suffering behind locked doors, under the radar of any interventions. In my case, a handful of violent incidents in our house were reported. I remember personally calling the police and then listening as they lectured my mum on not “winding up” her partner before leaving us to it. These statistics and stories make for grim reading. But the NSPCC is now trying to ensure that kids like me are helped. It is calling for Dominic Raab to use the victims’ bill – which is in consultation this week – to ensure easy, guaranteed access to professional services for kids who’ve been victims of domestic violence. And specifically for local authorities to have a statutory duty to provide specialist, therapeutic services in the community. Isn’t it the least we owe our kids? If we couldn’t protect them while they suffered unspeakable, unthinkable things, we at least need to give them the chance of healthy, happy lives in the aftermath. It’s unacceptable for the matter of a child receiving the help they need to be a matter of luck and location. They don’t deserve to have their lives left in ruins before they’ve even truly begun. If I’d been offered immediate support as a child, I don’t believe that my memories and experiences would have been scrubbed from me. But would I have ended up in a locked psychiatric ward at 33, sinking into the soil under which my secrets and trauma lay? There’s every chance that no, I wouldn’t. It’s too late to reach back through time and pull that girl off the window ledge and into safe arms; but it’s not too late for the children of today and of tomorrow.

2/4/2022,"South Park subsists on controversy and conflict the same way you and I subsist on carbon-based food matter. In this respect, the show could ostensibly go on forever; the world sure isn’t getting less hysterical and contentious with time, providing Trey Parker and Matt Stone with an infinite supply of grist for their mill of proudly dim-witted parody. (Or at least, enough to fulfill their contract with Comedy Central for another five seasons and 12 hour-long TV movies to run on the Paramount Plus platform.) Limited more by the practicalities of maintaining a famously rigorous production schedule under the added strain of a pandemic than by creative stagnation, the show now returns to a regular season order following a quasi-hiatus that saw 2020 and 2021 pass with a pair of specials apiece. And because America continues to grow more fractious and paranoid, a pop-culture institution entering its 25th season still has plenty to work with – yet little to say.  The recent tragedy of parents and children everywhere comes to South Park as a lucky break, the setting at an elementary school placing the foulmouthed tots right in the zeitgeist’s crosshairs. As the most inflammatory subject of public discourse, masking naturally claims the focus of last night’s premiere episode Pajama Day. The students in Mr Garrison’s classroom are abuzz about the chance to model their comfiest clothing for friends during the schoolwide holiday Mr Mackey calls “the Met Gala for children”. But when the youngsters show insufficient enthusiasm for Mr Garrison’s news that he’s found a boyfriend, he freaks out and bans them all from taking part in Pajama Day, an injustice that the town’s grownups protest by wearing their own PJs to work, the store and every other enclosed space. Of course riots break out, and at every step of this convoluted societal breakdown, whoever feels slighted by the turns of fortune busts out a comparison to Germany under Nazi rule. Though it feels like we’re in a flashpoint moment as a nation and perhaps even species, this is basically business as usual for South Park. Parker and Stone continue to thrive on the non-commentary that their strategy of partial metaphor affords them, hiding behind the joke once it comes time to make a statement beyond the broadly agreeable. The divisiveness of pajama-wearing allows them to get a few good blows in, as in the scene that sees an anti-pajama-er declaring that he’ll never be cozy again, a succinct summation of the self-defeating “own the libs” philosophy currently dominating conservative thought. Earlier, rage faucet Cartman sputters a probable approximation of what many grade-schoolers have thought over the past couple of years: “We keep not doing anything wrong, and we keep getting fucked!” But the pressing question of pajamas turns into an easy out when the episode might strive to do more than articulate our pent-up frustration. Of course no one expects pearls of sagacity from the show with the talking poop and the weed-smoking towel, but the tidy resolution tying things up still comes as a cop-out. After a faux-stirring monologue about doing the right thing and how “saying you were wrong is sometimes the strongest thing you can do” (a line delivered with surprising, awkward sincerity from a cornerstone of nose-thumbing irony), PC Principal uses Opposite Day to defuse the tensions. The show invites and refuses real-world analogs at its own convenience, ultimately offering a shrug of the shoulders. That’s a slanted way of saying that in its third decade of existence, this show has maintained a freakish level of consistency, still getting its customary half-dozen-or-so laughs. There’s a well-deployed running joke about Matt Damon’s goofy commercials for Bitcoin bankrupting families by encouraging them to take risks in personal finance, and an amusing montage of mayhem set to the baby-friendly strains of the Laurie Berkner Band’s Pajama Time. It’s all easy enough to watch, especially for the hordes of longtime viewers for whom tuning in has become an annual ritual as reliable as the beginning of a new year. But familiarity and expectedness have never been aspirational qualities for South Park. You can’t spend 25 years making a TV show without developing some habits and routines, and it could be argued that that’s a necessity in the labor-intensive process of generating a complete work of original animation on a weekly basis. Even so, the danger of Stone and Parker’s subversive streak is the soul of the show. Without that, the buttons being pushed don’t feel so hot, a given topic’s equivalent of whinging about those clowns in Congress. Looking at the history of the small screen, an unending broadcast run and the guarantee of an easily satisfied audience have led to only one thing: complacency. With Parker and Stone now entering their 50s, the greatest challenge facing them is their own success.",Arts/Television & radio,South Park returns with plenty to work with but little to say,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/03/south-park-returns-25th-season-premiere-with-plenty-to-work-with-but-little-to-say
2/4/2022,"Bafta must hope that its nominations mark a fresh start after a year of pure mortification for that body caused by the Noel Clarke debacle: screenwriter-actor-director Clarke was presented in 2021 with the outstanding contribution to cinema award, despite accusations against him of bullying and abuse. Clarke denied accusations of sexual misconduct and the award finally had to be suspended. But this year’s list is very lively: the best director section is not lacking in inclusivity and good taste: Aleem Khan, Ryûsuke Hamaguchi, Audrey Diwan, Paul Thomas Anderson, Jane Campion and Julia Ducournau. (All fascinating choices – though I personally am a Titane refusenik, finding that film inferior to Ducournau’s debut, Raw.) Leading the nominations tally is Denis Villeneuve’s gigantic sci-fi adaptation Dune with 11 (though no director nod), then it’s Jane Campion’s enthralling The Power of the Dog with eight, and below that is Kenneth Branagh’s wonderfully heartfelt and sympathetic personal movie Belfast with six, based on his own early memories of a boyhood in Northern Ireland at the beginning of the Troubles. I was surprised actually not to see Belfast going higher than this and not actually leading the field, as it seems tailor-made to appeal to Bafta voters.  As far as snubs go, and whatever my reservations about the film, I am staggered to see nothing in the best actress category for Kristen Stewart’s enjoyable portrayal of Diana, Princess of Wales in Pablo Larraín’s satirical fantasy Spencer. Maybe native-Brit Bafta voters are slightly more sceptical about Stewart’s reading of Diana than was generally assumed. And I am sorry to see that David Lowery’s superb The Green Knight, with Dev Patel as the troubled Arthurian hero – one of the very best films of the year – seems to have been so widely forgotten. It could also be said that Guillermo del Toro’s savage noir Nightmare Alley deserved more than three nominations. Those who groan at the disparity of awards prestige and actual commercial success will note the complete absence of Spider-Man: No Way Home, which has ruled the global box office and got people back into the cinemas, even more so than James Bond in No Time to Die, which has picked up five nominations. Mamoru Hosoda’s dreamy Japanese anime Belle should really have got into the animations list. But Dune is a thrillingly cinematic spectacle, a futurist colonial tale in the Lawrentian desert, and if it turns out to dominate this year’s Baftas, this will be no disgrace: it is an awe-inspiring epic, a big-screen spectacle that is eerie and exotic, and actually an improvement on the previous adaptation directed by David Lynch. The Power of the Dog is an utterly gripping and operatic drama in the American west, a frontier of emotional and sexual dysfunction, with wonderful performances from Benedict Cumberbatch, Kirsten Dunst and Kodi Smit-McPhee. And then there is Branagh’s utterly seductive Belfast, which refuses the traditional dramatic language of anger, cynicism and despair. I admit I’m a bit dismayed to see the prominence of Adam McKay’s impeccably intentioned all-star climate change satire Don’t Look Up, which worryingly gets a best film nod, as well as best actor for Leonard DiCaprio. Don’t Look Up is the celeb comedy equivalent of Gal Gadot’s Imagine video. As far as the best actor nods go elsewhere, Mahershala Ali is a great pick for his excellent performance in the sci-fi drama Swan Song, and no one could begrudge the nomination for Will Smith for his crowd-pleasing turn in King Richard. On the best actress list, I’m rooting for Joanna Scanlan whose superb performance in After Love, playing the widow who realises her late husband was leading a double life, confirms her reputation as one of the most distinctive and valuable talents in British cinema. But the prize could well go to Alana Haim, for her remarkable acting debut in the glorious Licorice Pizza or to Lady Gaga for her outrageous and entertaining turn as the scorned woman in House of Gucci. The outstanding debut award is arguably the beating heart of the entire Bafta ceremony, and the prize which can make such a difference to careers, so it is great that Philip Barantini’s one-take restaurant drama Boiling Point in there, and also Rebecca Hall’s excellent movie Passing. So a very plausible range of achievement here, and my guess is that it’s Branagh’s Belfast that will convert most of these nominations.",Arts/Film,"Baftas 2022: a lively, good-taste nomination list despite some surprising omissions | Peter Bradshaw",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/03/baftas-2022-a-lively-good-taste-nomination-list-despite-some-surprising-omissions
2/4/2022,"Boris Johnson has bowed to pressure and rowed back on a controversial comment about Keir Starmer and Jimmy Savile, after three days of pressure from Tory MPs for him to withdraw the “smear”. The prime minister said he wanted to “clarify” his comments and admitted “a lot of people have got very hot under the collar”, hours after Jacob Rees-Mogg said it was “perfectly fair and reasonable”.  The controversy began on Monday, when Johnson launched an attack on Starmer during a testy Commons exchange about a damning document on alleged Covid rule-busting parties in No 10 and across Whitehall. In response to the Sue Gray inquriy, which identified serious failures of leadership at the top of government but was heavily pared back given an ongoing Scotland Yard investigation, Starmer called on Tory backbenchers to “end this farce” and oust Johnson. The prime minister retorted by accusing Starmer of trying to “prejudge a police inquiry”, adding that as director of public prosecutions from 2008tp 2013, Starmer had “spent most of his time prosecuting journalists and failing to prosecute Jimmy Savile”. Starmer later accused Johnson of “parroting the conspiracy theories of violent fascists” for political gain. A Tory MP and former chief whip, Julian Smith, also said the “smear” was “wrong and cannot be defended”. On Thursday, during a visit to Blackpool, Johnson was challenged to withdraw the remark. He said: “I want to be very clear about this because a lot of people have got very hot under the collar, and I understand why. “Let’s be absolutely clear, I’m talking not about the leader of the opposition’s personal record when he was director of public prosecutions and I totally understand that he had nothing to do personally with those decisions. “I was making a point about his responsibility for the organisation as a whole. I really do want to clarify that because it is important.” Three cabinet ministers have defended Johnson’s decision to use the false claim in the Commons. One, the justice secretary, Dominic Raab, admitted he could not substantiate it. The latest to defend the comment was Rees-Mogg, who said such remarks were “perfectly fair and reasonable points of political debate”. During business questions in parliament on Thursday, he said Starmer’s apology, made on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in 2013, was “following the principle of taking responsibility for what went on in his organisation and then apologised for the fallings”. Rees-Mogg said Johnson had “apologised similarly for mistakes that have been made in Downing Street” and added: “I think that what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, and the geese and the gander should not complain one for the other. They are perfectly fair and reasonable points of political debate.” Pete Wishart, the SNP’s shadow Commons leader, challenged Rees-Mogg to allow an urgent debate about parliamentary discourse and “how we hold members accountable for the veracity and truthfulness of things that are said in this house” given the fury about Johnson’s comment about the Starmer. Rees-Mogg said it was natural for MPs to dispute claims. He said: “That is why we have the forms of debate that we have. Because when people hold views strongly, and somebody else stands up and thinks the other thing, they say: ‘That’s not true’. “But it’s not a matter of truth, it’s a matter of opinion, which is what we discuss in this house. It’s not a matter of fact-checking.” While Starmer was head of the CPS, he commissioned a report in 2012 into why Savile had not been prosecuted when allegations of sexual assault were made to Surrey and Sussex police in 2007 and 2008. The report, completed by Alison Levitt QC, suggested that if some of the victims had known there were others making similar complaints against Savile, they might have been more prepared to give evidence in court. It also said there was no evidence found to suggest the decisions not to prosecute “were consciously influenced by any improper motive on the part of either police or prosecutors”. After the report’s publication, Starmer said: “I would like to take the opportunity to apologise for the shortcomings in the part played by the CPS in these cases. If this report and my apology are to serve their full purpose, then this must be seen as a watershed moment.”",News/Politics,Johnson backtracks on comment that Starmer failed to prosecute Savile,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/03/boris-johnson-backtracks-on-comment-that-starmer-failed-to-prosecute-savile
2/4/2022,"MPs have forced the publication of a government-commissioned research report that found low-income people reliant on disability benefits are struggling to meet essential living costs such as food, rent and energy bills. The report has been kept under wraps for over a year, with the work and pensions secretary, Theresa Coffey, repeatedly refusing to release it on the grounds it was necessary to “protect the private space” in which ministers develop policy.  The report was finally published on Thursday morning after the cross-party work and pensions select committee invoked rarely-used parliamentary powers to force its release, and accused ministers of “trying to bury uncomfortable truths”. Stephen Timms, the chair of the work and pensions committee, said the report gave “valuable insights” into the experiences of people on disability benefits: “While the system is working for some, we now know that others reported that they are still unable to meet essential living costs such as food and utility bills.” He added: “By persisting in its decision to hide away evidence of the struggles people are facing, the DWP will only have further harmed its reputation with disabled people at a time when – as its own officials have acknowledged – lack of trust is a major issue. In order to rebuild its relationship with disabled people, the DWP must stop trying to bury uncomfortable truths.” Anastasia Berry of the MS Society charity said the report highlighted the inadequacy of benefits for many disabled people: “Despite the DWP’s relentless attempts to bury this research, we can finally see what they’ve been so desperate to hide … It shows some are struggling to pay for essential day-to-day expenses, such as food, heating and medications, let alone these extra costs.” The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has already faced allegations from a whistleblower close to the research team that it intervened to reduce the number of references to unmet needs and the adequacy of benefits in the report. Separately, last week it emerged that Coffey had blocked the publication of an internal DWP research report into the effectiveness of benefit sanctions, arguing its release was not in the public interest. This is despite promises made to MPs three years ago that it would publish its findings. Under government social research protocols, the completed disability benefits report should have been released no later than 12 weeks after it was handed to the DWP in September 2020. Participants in the research – 120 people with a health condition or disability were interviewed in depth – were reportedly promised the report would be published, according to the Disability News Service. At the time, the adequacy of benefit levels was a major political issue amid a fiery debate over whether ministers should scrap or maintain the £20 universal credit Covid top-up, or extend the top-up to people on “legacy” disability benefits who were not in receipt of universal credit. The government announced last June that it would withdraw the £20 top-up in October, brushing off criticism that this would put the living standards of low-income households at risk. This amounted to the biggest overnight cut to the basic rate of social security since the second world war, according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. The disability benefits research, carried out by the National Centre for Social Research, found that for claimants with “restricted financial circumstances”, benefits offered the prospect of a regular income vital to enable them to meet basic day-to-day living costs. Despite this, some of the cohort of disabled claimants interviewed by researchers reported that the low value of benefits meant they “were still unable to meet essential living costs such as food and utility bills”. The DWP said: “We’re providing extensive support to millions of disabled people and those with a health condition to help them live independent lives. As the research shows, health and disability benefits, alongside other income streams, helped to meet almost all identified areas of additional need. “We are currently considering a range of policy options, drawing on wide evidence, research and analysis as part of the upcoming health and disability white paper. “Protecting a private space for policy development is important and we had committed to publish this report as soon as this policy work concluded.”",News/Society,MPs force publication of report into struggles of poorer disabled Britons,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/03/report-poorer-disabled-britons-mps-force-publication
2/4/2022,"The government’s cap on energy prices, which sets the maximum amount that energy suppliers can charge customers on a default tariff, will raise energy bills for about 22m homes to almost £2,000 a year from April. It was first introduced by the industry regulator, Ofgem, in early 2019 after the government called for a tool that could put an end to rip-off energy tariffs, and is calculated every six months to reflect the fair costs of supplying gas and electricity.  The catch? The energy price cap doesn’t always make energy prices affordable. Suppliers’ costs are soaring, which means Ofgem’s energy price cap has reached record levels, too. Here’s how the average dual-fuel energy bill breaks down under the price cap. The wholesale market price of gas and electricity plays the biggest role in determining the average energy bill. For the winter energy price cap, effective last October, market costs made up more than 40% of the total cap, or £528 of the average £1,277 dual-fuel energy bill. But in the new price cap from April, the market cost is more than twice as high at £1,077. Energy suppliers typically buy their gas and electricity from the market in advance, so Ofgem determines the cost of buying energy from the market by tracking wholesale prices over a period of six months ahead of the next price cap period. For example, the price cap in place over the winter months was based on the rising market prices recorded between February and July. However, the new price cap poised to drive bills higher from April was based on surging market prices between August and January, when market prices reached record highs. Experts have warned that market prices today could lead to even higher energy bills, of about £2,300 a year, by next winter. The cost of maintaining the electricity wires and gas pipes that carry energy to homes, offices and factory sites is paid to regional energy network companies through a levy on energy bills, which typically makes up about 20% of the average energy price cap. Ofgem is tasked with determining how much network companies are allowed to spend over set periods, and how much can be taken from energy bills. But in the latest energy price cap, customers will pay a higher rate for network costs to cover the cost of energy suppliers that have gone bust. Energy companies that take on customers after the collapse of a supplier can claim “any reasonable additional, otherwise unrecoverable, costs” of taking on the customers, according to Ofgem. These claims, paid to energy companies by the distribution network companies, are recovered from consumers via their charges. Over winter, network costs were £268, but in the latest energy price cap network costs have climbed to £371, 19% of the new cap. These costs relate to government social and environmental schemes to save energy, reduce emissions and encourage take-up of renewable energy. In recent months Conservative backbenchers have called on the government to drop some of these schemes to help relieve the pressure of rising energy bills on households, including the ECO scheme, which aims to upgrade home insulation for struggling households. The proposals have been widely criticised by consumer groups and climate campaigners for doing more harm than good. Ofgem’s figures show that policy costs make up less than 8% of the new energy price cap at £153, down from £159 or 12% in the previous price cap. The energy price cap allows for the costs incurred by suppliers to deliver billing and metering services to their customers, including the installation of smart meters, while making a reasonable profit. Energy companies were allowed to claim operating costs of £204 from the average annual energy bill under the winter price cap, but under the new price the cost allowance has grown by almost 10%, to £220. VAT is set at 5% for energy bills, which for the winter price cap meant £61 for the Treasury from the average household. Under the new energy price cap the amount for each household is expected to climb to about £98, or more than £2.1bn in total. The Treasury windfall led to calls ahead of the price cap announcement for the government to offer extra help to hard-pressed families by temporarily cutting VAT. The price cap also allows for smaller costs including a slim margin for energy company profits.",Lifestyle/Money,How the UK energy price cap is calculated – and how it affects your bill,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/03/how-the-uk-energy-price-cap-is-calculated-and-affects-your-bill
2/4/2022,"The UN special envoy to Myanmar has been widely rebuked for suggesting that pro-democracy activists should negotiate a power-sharing agreement with the country’s military, which is accused of atrocities including genocide. Almost 250 civil society organisations published a statement condemning the comments, warning they risked emboldening the military to commit “grave crimes with total impunity”.  “These statements could set a dangerous precedent, that those who take control through brutal means – massacring, killing, raping, arresting, torturing, burning villages and people, targeting civilians using airstrikes and shelling – be welcomed to share power,” it said. The statement was signed by 247 local and national civil society groups including Progressive Voice, Women’s League of Burma and Union of Karenni State Youth. In February 2021, Myanmar's progress towards democracy was brutally stalled when the military seized power and took control of the country.   In the year since, the country has been plunged into violence, poverty and mass displacement as the military attempts to crush widespread resistance to its rule.  Internet blackouts, arbitrary arrests, a ruthless curtailing of freedom of speech and escalating military attacks on civilian areas have silenced the voices of people from Myanmar.   For this special series, the Guardian’s Rights and freedom project has partnered with a diverse group of journalists from Myanmar, many working in secret, to bring their reporting on life under military rule to a global audience. Journalists in Myanmar are working in dangerous and difficult circumstances, as the military government attacks the free press and shuts down local media outlets. Many reporters still inside the country fear arrest, with others forced to leave their homes and go into hiding in areas increasingly under attack from military forces.  All the reporting in this series will be carried out by journalists from Myanmar, with support from the editors on the Rights and freedom project. These are the stories that journalists from Myanmar want to tell about what is happening to their country at this critical moment. Noeleen Heyzer, the UN’s special envoy for Myanmar, provoked controversy during an interview with Channel News Asia when discussing ways to address the country’s crisis. Asked about the possibility of a power-sharing arrangement – an idea firmly opposed by the Myanmar people – Heyzer responded: “The point is, we have to start a process. And you can’t immediately come in with the ultimate solution of what you want. The military is in control at this particular time and something has got to be worked out. It could be a process,” she said. Heyzer added: “I know that many people, especially the young, are willing to die fighting for a total political transformation. Any political transformation requires a process and it is not going to happen overnight. And therefore I want them to have something to live for, not to die for. They need to negotiate what this power sharing could look like over a long term. And they have to be at the table.” The comments prompted a furious response from activists, who have been subjected to relentless violence by the military, which seized power from the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi a year ago. Many young people have taken up arms and joined local defence forces to fight for democracy. The office of the special envoy of the secretary general on Myanmar has since issued a statement to local media, claiming that Heyzer’s comments were misinterpreted. The special envoy had “never proposed power sharing as an option”, it said. The statement added: “The special envoy has emphasised in no uncertain terms that any peace process has to be led by the people of Myanmar.” Naw Hser Hser, of the Women’s League of Burma, a signatory of the joint statement, said the UN was growing distant from the calls of the people of Myanmar. “Ultimately, the people of Myanmar are realising that it is they themselves that will be the ones to succeed in this revolution,” she said.“Despite vehement calls from the people of Myanmar, the UN has yet to take action to stop the terrorist military’s grave crimes. One year has passed [since the coup] and the UN security council has issued only statements and even failed to hold an open meeting or issue a concrete resolution,” Naw Hser Hser added. The extreme violence used by the military to try to suppress opposition was a sign of its lack of control, she said. “In rural areas, they are losing ground, as local people’s defence forces and ethnic organisations control swathes of territory. New administrative structures, comprising the people, are being established at local levels, governing where the military cannot. They are far from being in control,” said Naw Hser Hser. Even before the coup, the military was guaranteed huge powers under the 2008 constitution, which granted it a quarter of all seats in parliament and control of key ministries, including home affairs and defence. Nonetheless, the military seized power on 1 February 2021, accusing Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) of voter fraud – an allegation that has been dismissed by observers. Zoya Phan, coordinator of the European Karen Network, said Heyzer’s comments had been made on the same day the military launched more airstrikes against civilians in south-eastern Karen state, also known as Kayin state. “The Burmese military was in a power sharing with the NLD-led government before the coup. However, the attacks against ethnic people didn’t stop,” said Zoya Phan, who is also campaigns manager for Burma Campaign UK. “With the Burmese military, our country will have no positive future,” she added.
