4/18/2022,"Facebook has been accused of failing to invest sufficiently to combat misinformation as it pursues rapid growth in Africa, where the Covid pandemic has highlighted the outsize role played by social media in online discourse. Traditional media and governments have an increasingly limited ability to control information flows on the continent, as social media platforms including Facebook seek to expand rapidly, though largely without fanfare. “Facebook are losing users left, right and centre in the global north, so where are the new users coming from? The global south,” said Anri van der Spuy, a senior researcher at Research ICT Africa, a thinktank. Sub-Saharan Africa has a population of 1.1 billion and, at an average of about 30%, internet use is three times higher than a decade ago. Toussaint Nothias, research director at the Digital Civil Society Lab of Stanford University, who has worked extensively on Facebook, said it was “generally accepted” that Facebook had launched an “aggressive expansion” in the global south to win new users following a decline in the developed world. “Africa has a young growing population and so offers opportunities for Facebook to become an entry to the internet, via Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram or whatever. That can be monetised down the line,” he said. Many – but not all – academic studies have linked Covid vaccine hesitancy with misinformation circulating on social media in Africa, as elsewhere. In some parts of the continent, such as South Africa, hesitancy was the biggest challenge facing vaccination campaigns. Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa, has talked of an “infodemic”, which she defines as “a glut of information with misinformation in the mix [which] makes it hard to know what is right and real”. False information circulating on social media included claims that non-white people cannot contract Covid-19 or that it can be cured with steam or traditional remedies such as herbal tea. Conspiracy theories describing plots by western companies or governments to test vaccines in Africa or slow demographic growth have also spread widely. “The regulation side is very problematic,” said van der Spuy. “It has not been resolved in the global north either but the risks are much bigger in the south … you don’t have the same safety net of literacy skills and ability to cross-check nor the safeguard of adequate policies or capable institutions … Facebook is investing in addressing some of these challenges, but not nearly enough.” Facebook relies on an expanding network of hundreds of third-party factcheckers across Africa to initiate investigations and respond to complaints from users. If concerns are found to be justified, warnings are attached to posts, which are also downgraded in the algorithms that direct traffic. Some accounts are taken down. A spokesperson for Meta, which owns Facebook, described misinformation as a complex and constantly evolving societal challenge for which there is no “silver bullet”. But, they said, Facebook now employed a global team of 40,000 working on safety and security, including 15,000 people who review content in more than 70 languages – including Amharic, Somali, Swahili and Hausa, among others. This helped the company “debunk false claims in local languages, including claims related to elections and vaccines”. “We’ve also made changes to our policies and products to ensure fewer people see false information and are made aware of it when they do, and have been highlighting reliable vaccine information through our global Covid-19 information centre,” the spokesperson said. However, posts are not usually removed unless seen as directly encouraging violence or hate, leading to concerns that some may be viewed by large audiences even after being flagged as false or misleading. “They do take things down occasionally but it takes a long time,” said Stuart Jones, director of the Centre for Analytics and Behavioural Change in South Africa, which monitors social media in the country. Facebook claims that more than 95% of the time when people see a factchecking labels, they don’t go on to view the original content. Other platforms are also struggling to contain misinformation. “Social media [in South Africa], especially Twitter, is dominated by anti-vaccine voices,” said Jones. “We’ve not identified organised networks but dealing with people with very loud voices speaking often and very passionately. The pro-vaccine voices are more moderate and don’t get the same outrage and aren’t shared as much. So the algorithms kick in and it just all runs away.” Frances Haugen, a former manager at Facebook turned whistleblower, has said that her concerns over an apparent lack of safety controls in non-English language markets, such as Africa and the Middle East, were a key factor in her decision to go public. “I did what I thought was necessary to save the lives of people, especially in the global south, who I think are being endangered by Facebook’s prioritisation of profits over people,” Haugen told the Guardian last year. Workers at factchecking organisations across Africa who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity said they were confident their work made some difference but worried that the impact was very limited. “What we do is important and does stop some people reading stuff that simply isn’t true. But I worry that it really is just a tiny fraction of what’s out there,” one said. Some say it is difficult to judge to what extent Facebook’s downgrading of such posts in news feeds restricts exposure and worry that the company has not released a breakdown of figures for funding of factchecking operations in Africa. “There seems to be as little as possible real investment on the continent in terms of engaging people directly or hiring people with real local knowledge,” said Grace Mutung’u, a policy researcher and lawyer based in Nairobi, Kenya. “It is a matter of accountability. If you take up such a huge responsibility in society, you should equally invest in solving the problems that come out of it. They have the resources, what is lacking is the willpower.” Officials at the WHO say they are concerned about encrypted private applications such as WhatsApp, which remain “invisible”, as it is impossible to know what is being said or shared, and very difficult to intervene to stem the flow of false information. WhatsApp is also owned by Meta, which owns Facebook. The company said it was taking steps to address the problem. Nothias said that there was no easy obvious solution to the problem of content moderation, but “simple things” such as committing greater resources would help. “Currently, in comparison to the wealth of the company and its social responsibility … it is pretty minimal,” he said. “They are just not taking it seriously enough, or putting enough money into it. When you consider it really just is a question of their social responsibility against their duty to their investors, it’s not so hard to understand. They are just a corporation.”",News/World news,Facebook ‘lacks willpower’ to tackle misinformation in Africa,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/18/facebook-accused-of-lacking-willpower-to-tackle-misinformation-in-africa
4/18/2022,"Hundreds of unaccompanied children who have arrived in the UK on small boats in the last few months are suffering from hunger and neglect in hotels, charities have said. Charity workers have catalogued a list of concerns about the welfare of lone asylum-seeking children in hotels, with some being forced to shave their heads after scabies outbreaks and to wear prison-style grey tracksuits. Philip Ishola, the chief executive officer of the human rights organisation Love 146, which works to end child trafficking, said there are serious concerns about the welfare of the children placed in hotels by the Home Office. “There’s a rogue system which has been created outside of the ‘children looked after’ framework. It has a detrimental effect on children who arrive highly traumatised and in desperate need,” he said. Concerns include: Inadequate food that is not nourishing leaving some children to go hungry. Inadequate clothing, including prison-style plain grey tracksuits or insufficient changes of clothes. Scabies outbreaks where children have shaved each other’s heads to try to rid themselves of the infection. On 23 November last year, the national transfer scheme, in which local authorities volunteer to look after unaccompanied child asylum seekers, became mandatory for all local authorities in order to avoid some having to look after a disproportionately large number of children. According to an answer to a parliamentary question by immigration minister Kevin Foster, between 23 November and 22 February there were 361 children who were not yet in local authority care. These children are generally accommodated in hotels around the UK until a local authority foster placement can be found. Love146 workers say they are aware of about 250 unaccompanied children in hotels in the London region alone at the moment and many more in other parts of the country. The true figure is likely to be higher than these estimates as Home Office officials sometimes wrongly assess children to be adults. The charity says it has come across a child as young as 14 wrongly assessed as an adult by the Home Office, before a local authority later found them to be 14. Lauren Starkey, a social worker at Love146, said: “There is no provision in the Children Act for the Home Office to assume parental responsibility. Children have been distressed and embarrassed wearing grey prison tracksuits and flip-flops. I’m shocked that things could get this bad.” Azmina Siddique, policy and impact manager at the Children’s Society, said: “Every single one of these children is a child who is here without a family member to look after them. Many will have been forced to flee their home due to violence, war or persecution. The Home Office has a safeguarding duty to promote and protect the welfare of all separated children in their care. “These children need to feel safe and should be in proper, regulated accommodation, not hotels, which are unacceptable. They must have access to legal advice and it is imperative they receive the mental health and wellbeing support they so desperately need.” Bridget Chapman of Kent Refugee Action Network, which supports unaccompanied young asylum seekers, said: “We are extraordinarily concerned for the wellbeing of these children. All of them need to be accommodated in appropriate settings with trained foster carers.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “The government is working to ensure the needs of newly arriving unaccompanied asylum-seeking children are met. We are grateful for the continued support of local authorities to provide vital care to vulnerable children and we continue to keep the national transfer scheme under review to ensure a fair and equitable distribution of responsibility across the UK.”",News/UK news,"Lone child refugees suffering neglect in UK hotels, charities say",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/18/lone-child-refugees-suffering-neglect-in-uk-hotels-charities-say
4/18/2022,"An estimated 350,000 weddings are set to take place this year, and couples spend an average of £32,000 on tying the knot. Those prices are expected to rise considerably in 2022 as some couples look to make up for the last two years of lockdown restrictions but you should be realistic about what you can afford and how many guests you can accommodate. To work out a budget, consider how much time you have until your wedding and how much you can build up that fund between now and your planned date. Look at your monthly spending to see how much you can start saving with simple adjustments to your current lifestyle, says Karen Barrett, the founder and chief executive of the financial adviser website Unbiased.co.uk. “Set up a separate savings account to ringfence the money you both save,” she says. “You can also earn interest tax free in a cash Isa, though there are limits on how much you can save each year. The total amount you can save annually into all your Isas is currently £20,000.” If you decide to borrow money on a credit card or via a loan, remember you could be paying for it for some time to come. Nobody wants to have to drag their wedding dress through muddy puddles or shiver down the aisle, so it’s no surprise that summer is the most popular time to get married. But it comes at a price. To make a saving, avoid “wedding season” – from May to October. Weekends are also more expensive. Some venues offer deals for midweek weddings, as well as for off-season dates (November, early December, January and February). According to the wedding planning site Hitched, booking a venue Monday to Friday in the off-season can save you up to £10,000. Liz Taylor, a wedding planner at the Taylor Lynn Corporation, says changing the time of your wedding can also help you get more out of your budget. “Get married in the morning and have a family wedding brunch or 1920s-inspired afternoon tea,” she suggests. “Here you save on an expensive bar bill and reduce catering costs compared to a full wedding breakfast. Similarly, an evening ceremony and then just one party saves, but also leads to exciting catering opportunities. Think about street food or hot fish and chips wrapped in wedding-branded paper. Simple – and your guests will love it.” You can’t just get married anywhere. Before the coronavirus pandemic, ceremonies had to be held inside or in a permanent outdoor structure. But the rules were relaxed temporarily during the pandemic, and from the start of this month, outdoor civil weddings in England and Wales were legalised permanently. Similar rules on religious weddings will follow. However, the ceremony will still have to be held at a licensed venue – so forget about exchanging vows on a romantic beach at sunset. If you want that, head to Scotland, where just about anywhere goes and you could save thousands on venue hire. The average cost of hiring a licensed wedding venue comes in at £5,406 but you can save significantly by tying the knot in a register office (from £57) or church (from £500). The reception afterwards does not have to cost a fortune either. Think about a pub or village hall, for example. Or if you are lucky enough to have a big garden, or access to one, you could hire a marquee. Depending on the time of year and the size, you can expect to pay between £650 and £3,000 for a marquee hire. Yes, the Duchess of Cambridge looked breathtaking in her designer wedding frock but high street and online retailers have plenty of looks at affordable prices. Another great option, which is also kind to the planet, is to buy a “pre-loved” dress. Check out sites such as Stillwhite, Bridal Reloved, or Oxfam’s wedding dress page. The groom could also consider hiring a suit for the day. Hire of a black tuxedo from Moss Bros, for example, costs £69.95. Meanwhile, Burton charges £68 for hire of a two-piece suit, or £110 for packages that include jacket, trousers, waistcoat, shirt, neckwear and hankie. Once the wedding is over, you could get money back by selling items such as your dress, shoes and other paraphernalia from your big day. Bouquets and other floral decorations can be expensive, not to mention wasteful. Repurposing the flowers used for the ceremony at the reception is not only more economical, it is more environmentally friendly. So is opting for seasonal and local blooms. The florist and author Judith Blacklock says that if you are marrying in a popular church, you can sometimes team up with another bride getting married the same day and reuse their floral arrangements. Alternatively, you could pick your own flowers and foliage. “Think of those close to you who have gardens and are good-natured. Go and investigate,” Blacklock says. “You want foliage that will last and doesn’t wilt as soon as you get home. Deciduous foliage such as beech needs to be mature to last – say from late June onwards. Wild evergreen foliage such as ivy is brilliant. But if you forage, do take care and only take judiciously where growing abundantly. Be gentle and don’t denude an area. “Consider using Daucus carrot – Queen Anne’s lace (also known as cow parsley) that grows in profusion in April and May. It grows rampantly but, even so, take only a small amount carefully.” The average couple spends £65 on food and drink for each of their wedding guests, according to Hitched.co.uk. Choosing venues without corkage allows you to bring in your own booze without being charged for opening it and drinking it on-site. Meanwhile, eschewing formal dining for more relaxed buffet-style food and drink stations, where people can grab bites and top up as they please, is another potential money saver. Another is opting for a sweet cart offering guests a selection of cupcakes and desserts to replace the traditional – and typically expensive – cake options on the big day. “Buy beer barrels from local breweries that tend to offer the pump as a rental,” advises Anna Davison, the chief executive of the Tiny Wedding Company. “Setting up ‘pimp your’ gin and prosecco tables is a lovely added extra, too. Fire pits with s’mores and toasted marshmallows in the evening is also great fun once the sun goes down.” There’s no need to fork out on an expensive DJ: make your own playlist on Spotify (a premium subscription is £9.99 a month). It will be more personal and match your musical tastes. Instead of paying for a professional photographer (on average £1,200), give people disposable cameras to create their own wedding memories. Or buy a Polaroid camera, lots of film, set up a backdrop and make some props.",Lifestyle/Money,How to cut the cost of your wedding,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/18/how-to-cut-the-cost-of-your-wedding-venue-flowers
4/18/2022,"If Squid Game did marriage guidance counselling, it might look like this huis-clos, horror-flecked psychological mystery-thriller, which takes place almost entirely in the confines of a high-spec rental house hired by a couple on their anniversary hoping to pep up their flagging relationship. After a few nightcaps on their first evening together, writer Emma (Jill Awbrey, who also scripted) and husband Henry (Bart Johnson) fall unconscious. They wake up locked in and fitted with behind-the-ear implants that deliver agonising pain if they don’t comply with the distorted voice that – initially via a rotary phone, then through speakers around the house – bids them: “You must obey!” Weirdly, what the voice wants is to educate them in the ways of old-fashioned, courteous coupledom. “A man should open the door for his wife,” it says, before having them get into their glad rags and forcing Emma to prepare dinner. As this matrimonial-minded malefactor puts them through their paces, revealing personal secrets on the way, it’s unclear if he truly is a stickler for sincerity and consideration, or with this coerced parody of marriage is dragging them bleeding and screaming towards the realisation that the entire institution is a sham. The eventual reveal feeds into the post-#MeToo landscape of sexual politics a little too brazenly; the underlying tenets about male mindsets are more suited to the 1950s than the 2020s. Some of the cat-and-mouse plot mechanics as Emma and Henry try to escape, are uninspired, and Travis Cluff and Chris Lofing’s direction is as anonymous as the house’s lacquered surfaces. But the deft set of deceptions in Held’s final stretch are astutely handled, with Awbrey’s circumspect Emma riding out this gender slugging match to, if not a totally convincing feminist statement, then at least a confident calling card of a lead role.  Held is available on digital platforms on 25 April.",Arts/Film,Held review – claustrophobic thriller is Squid Games does marriage counselling,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/18/held-review-if-squid-games-did-marriage-counselling
4/18/2022,"Iwouldn’t go swimming in England’s rivers in the same way that I wouldn’t flush my head down a public toilet. It’s not just me who feels this way. Even Sir James Bevan, the chief executive of the Environment Agency – the regulator responsible for protecting and improving water in England – has said he would be “cautious” about it, first seeking out assurances by checking the websites of the EA and the campaign group Surfers Against Sewage before going for a paddle. Bevan’s agency does provided some assurances – as long as you only wish to swim in one of the country’s 417 or so designated bathing water sites, most of which are at the coast. In fact, there are only around a dozen inland bathing lakes in the whole country; and, for now, just one river – in Ilkley, West Yorkshire – which was rated “poor” in the agency’s last assessment of bathing water, so you might want to swerve it anyway. Better to hop across the Channel instead, where France can offer around 1,300 glorious lakes and rivers designated for safe swimming among its 3,300 bathing sites. The main reason Defra, which sponsors the EA, is loth to greenlight river swimming is that sewage, farm, urban and industrial pollution is so widespread that all of England’s rivers failed to meet the legal standard for overall health the last time they were assessed. It’s not the EA’s fault though, according to the agency. It has pleaded poverty over the abysmal state of our watercourses, stating that “you get the environment you pay for” and calling for more government funding to enable it to nobble polluters and do its job properly. So where does that leave the wild swimmers, the boaters, the anglers and pretty much anyone who would prefer to stroll alongside a shining stream than an open sewer? Sensing abandonment by the agency – compounded by its recent moves to stop attending “low-impact” pollution incidents and the low morale of staff who say they are no longer able to deter polluters – communities have begun to take matters into their own hands. It appears, at first glance, as though it is working. It began last year when the people of the Ilkley Clean River Group in West Yorkshire succeeded in getting a stretch of the River Wharfe, already popular with swimmers, designated as an official bathing water site. Situated downstream of a sewage treatment works, the group knew the water would not be safe and concluded that a bathing designation was the only way to oblige the Environment Agency to install a water quality monitor and acknowledge the level of pollution there. After a bizarre scrap to get the agency to locate the monitor downstream of the sewage works rather than in the cleaner water upstream, that stretch of the Wharfe officially became the first river bathing water in England, albeit one with poor water quality. A year on and we now have a grand total of two river bathing sites: thanks to the efforts of the Thames21 charity, a stretch of the River Thames in Oxford will also be granted bathing water status next month. France we are not, but could these two sites signal the first green shoots of a wider society-led movement to clean up our rivers? The Rivers Trust and Surfers Against Sewage (SAS) campaign groups hope so. Together they’ve compiled a map showing 273 popular river recreation spots, including some where there is already community interest in setting up a bathing water designation, such as Warleigh Weir on the River Avon and Sheep’s Green on the River Cam. SAS has also launched a petition calling for Defra to create 200 new bathing sites by 2030. Bagging a bathing water site is relatively straightforward, according to Thames21. For anyone embarking on the process, it recommends convening river users, picking a popular spot with access and facilities, researching pollution risks, logging the number of people using the river during the May-September bathing season, getting the landowner’s permission, raising public awareness and then making a formal application to Defra. It sounds simple, but Prof Becky Malby from the Ilkley Clean River Group points out that there is no transparency over Defra’s decision-making and that it takes around two years to complete the whole process – time which, in their case, would have been better spent fixing sewage spills from the nearby water firm’s pipes. So we’re in (at best) muddy waters. Clearly, the growing bathing water movement is positive and the associated public awareness is critical if things are to improve, but it doesn’t get anywhere near addressing the problem of chronic and widespread river pollution. A couple of Environment Agency tests for two types of bacteria taken at one site during the bathing season doesn’t even begin to scratch the surface of the number of pollutants flowing through our beauty spots, or the consequent risks to people and wildlife. What we need are wholesale improvements to entire catchments made by tougher regulation of the biggest polluters: the water industry and agriculture. A few bathing designations on a river in a catchment that is inundated with sewage pollution or choked by farm fertilisers will not be enough to make swimming safe.
