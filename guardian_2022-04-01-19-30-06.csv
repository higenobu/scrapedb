4/1/2022,"India’s famous living bridges – the roots of trees coaxed and stretched into the form of a suspension bridge over a river – have been submitted to Unesco’s tentative list for the coveted world heritage site status. The mountainous state of Meghalaya in the north-east has more than 100 such bridges in 70 villages, unique structures created by a combination of nature and human ingenuity. Once a bamboo structure has been stretched across the river, the roots of the tree, usually the rubber tree (Ficus Elastica), are teased and manipulated to become entwined with the bamboo until it becomes a strong mesh. The roots are allowed to grow gradually and strengthen over time. In the initial stages, only about 15-20 people can cross the bridge in a day. Much later, it can be as many as 50 or more, although it can take up to two decades for a living roots bridge to be finished. In a remote region like Meghalaya, known as the “Abode of Clouds” and claiming the title of “wettest place on earth”, Cherrapunji, building roads is not feasible. The topography is dense jungle dotted with waterfalls, steep slopes, lakes and streams. The living root bridges are the only way people in a village can cross a river to reach the other side to farm, sell produce, reach a doctor or send children to school. During general elections, officials on horseback carrying ballot boxes to remote villages have no other means of reaching voters but these natural bridges. Known locally as Jingkieng Jri, some bridges are double-deckers. Some are high above a valley, while others are just a few metres above the surface of a river. A description on the Unesco website says: “Grown by indigenous Khasi tribal communities, these structural ecosystems have performed in extreme climatic conditions for centuries, and encapsulate a profound harmony between humans and nature … validating the resilience of an ancient culture, where collective cooperation and reciprocity were the fundamental building blocks of life. “Each living root structure reveals a distinct ethno-botanical journey rooted in profound culture-nature reciprocity and synthesis. The intergenerational growth process of nurturing a sapling into a robust load-bearing structure in extreme climate and geography reveals exceptional enterprise and skill, suggesting a masterpiece of human creative genius.” The root bridges are not yet afforded world heritage status. However, by placing them on Unesco’s “tentative list”, the Indian government is making a vital step needed to submit them for consideration by the World Heritage Committee. Morningstar Khongthaw, 23, is the founder of the Living Bridges Foundation, which builds new bridges and helps preserve old ones. His village, Rangthylling, has 20 living roots bridges. “I am very glad that the knowledge of our elders has been recognised by Unesco. We want to multiply this knowledge so that future generations also benefit,” said Khongthaw. Already popular with tourists, the state government has been pushing for the Unesco tag for years in the hope that it will become easier to preserve the bridges while boosting tourism even further. James Sangma, a cabinet minister in Meghalaya, expressed the state’s excitement in a tweet. He said: “The living root bridges not only stand out for their exemplary human-environment symbiotic relationship but also focus on their pioneering use for connectivity and resilience, and the need to adopt sustainable measures to balance economy and ecology.”",News/World news,‘The knowledge of our elders’: India’s living root bridges submitted to Unesco,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/01/india-living-root-bridges-submitted-to-unesco
4/1/2022,"One of the UK’s leading music venues, which played a pivotal role in the careers of bands including Pulp, Kaiser Chiefs and Arctic Monkeys, is at the centre of a row over whether it will close. News that the Leadmill in Sheffield might be shutting brought a wave of dismay on social media but was on Friday firmly rejected by the venue’s landlord, the Brixton-based Electric Group. Its CEO and co-founder, Dominic Madden, said : “For avoidance of doubt, we are music people, we spend our lives running independent music venues and the Leadmill will continue to operate as a special music venue. The management may change but the song stays the same.” The Leadmill said in its statement on Thursday it had received the “devastating news” that in a year’s time “our landlord is evicting us and forcing us to close”. It has asked people to share the news and send their favourite memories as part of a campaign to save the venue, using the hashtag #WeCantLoseLeadmill. The Leadmill opened in 1980 and is Sheffield’s longest running live music venue. It is also an important venue on the UK comedy circuit and hosts club events, theatre and screenings. In its statement, the venue said: “Since 1980 The Leadmill has spent millions of pounds on what was a derelict warehouse, transforming it into one of the UK’s most respected venues where countless acts from across the globe have performed over the years.” The Electric Group, which bought the freehold in 2017, insisted that the Leadmill was not closing and it was investing a substantial sum in the venue. Mike Weller, head of music at Electric Group, said: “There was never any question of us closing the Leadmill, despite all the social media chat. “The refurb will make the room better equipped to accommodate the modern wants of live music and club nights, for audiences and performers. We want to ensure the Leadmill’s future is as exciting as its history.” News of its possible closure was met with concern by a string of big names in the music and comedy worlds. Tim Burgess, the lead singer of the Charlatans said: “Such a brilliant venue. Let’s do all we can to stop @Leadmill from closing.” He posted a ticket from a Charlatans gig there in 2001, to which one fan responded with fond memories: “Pinched a Wonderland cardboard advertising board on the way home. Had that in my room at uni for the next two years. Good times.” The official Twitter account of The Subways asked: “In what world is this allowed to happen? Unacceptable. A heritage site that needs saving!!!” The band Sea Power posted: “Terrible news about Sheffield @Leadmill. We’ve played so many great gigs here, and we’re back again in 2 weeks time.” Joe Lycett, the comedian, said closure would be “a terrible loss to culture in the UK”. The Leadmill has been the venue for countless important music events, including the first gig of Pulp in August 1980. A plaque was unveiled to mark its 35th anniversary in 2015, with Jarvis Cocker recalling how inexperienced the band was at the time. “It was the first time we’d been on a proper stage, and when our bass player started experiencing feedback he didn’t know what to do, so he started walking towards the front of the stage and fell off it,” Cocker told NME. “People found us entertaining, but only because we were a bunch of mad kids who didn’t know how to play.” They also smelled of cabbage, he said, because they used a mobile grocer’s van to transport their equipment. Arctic Monkeys were another band who regularly played at the Leadmill in their formative years and debuted their second album there. The Kaiser Chiefs said: We played @Leadmill in our early days and not only do we have very fond memories, it really helped us, too. It would be a huge loss not just for Sheffield and Yorkshire, but the whole UK music scene.” The Leadmill has been approached for further comment.

4/1/2022,"From the very start, it was clear that Partygate should have been a resigning matter for the prime minister. It was obvious that the gatherings, which took place at No 10 at a time when families were denied the right to see their loved ones on their deathbeds, were deeply insensitive. They ignited a sense of “us” and “them” that had been smouldering since Dominic Cummings’ infamous outing to Barnard Castle. Still worse, the sight of Downing Street staff joking about their merrymaking suggested that “they” held “us” in contempt – a position that sounded the death knell for the public’s trust in government. Four months after the revelations of Downing Street’s parties first broke, things have moved on. The police have investigated the Downing Street parties, concluded the rules were broken, and have started issuing fines – 20 so far, with more expected soon. Even Dominic Raab, the justice minister, accepts that the parties happened and that the prime minister was wrong to tell parliament they didn’t. But the world is a very different place. As far as the headlines are concerned, Covid is yesterday’s crisis; Ukraine is today’s. Yesterday’s lying buffoon has today found his Churchillian moment. At a time when Johnson appears to be standing up to Putin’s tyranny, it might seem that there is far less reason to remove him from office. In fact, there is even more reason to do so. The fundamental issue is Johnson’s relationship to the truth. By February, a clear majority of people thought the prime minister was dislikeable (55%), weak (61%), incompetent (68%) and indecisive (69%). The public were at their most scathing about Johnson when asked whether they trusted him. Already in December, 69% of people considered Johnson to be untrustworthy (versus 15% who thought him trustworthy). Two months later, the figures had managed to slide still further: 75% didn’t trust him versus a mere 11% who did. In effect, the scandal removed the ability of the government to do its job. In the midst of the greatest national crisis of our generation, it is hardly desirable to have a leadership that is only listened to by one in nine people. But now the issue is not so much that we believe Johnson is lying when he says he did nothing wrong. Right from the start a slew of polls showed that the great majority of people didn’t believe his denials. Indeed, in February, more than 80% of people thought he broke the rules. Possibly, as Johnson’s story constantly shifted from “there were no parties” to “I didn’t attend any parties” to “I didn’t realise they were parties” to “I had a right to attend”, his credibility was eroded further. What has become clear is not just that Boris Johnson lied, but that he isn’t bothered about lying or about being seen to lie. This matters, not just because it harms trust in this government, and therefore its ability to effectively govern. It’s also harmful because it makes the formation of consensus about what is “true” almost impossible. In Hannah Arendt’s seminal text The Origins of Totalitarianism, she argued that the dying of democracy is marked by a progressive contempt for facts and for those who study them, and a growing belief that truth derives from the power of those who fabricate it. If there is no independent validation of reality, what is permissible – and what counts as “true” – comes down to who is most shameless and shouts the loudest. Arendt also recognised that those who go in this direction must surround themselves with acolytes whose only talent lies in fawning before power, whatever the truth. It is almost as if she had been watching the apologists for today’s Conservative party defending Johnson’s untruths on television when she wrote: “Totalitarianism in power invariably replaces all first-rate talents, regardless of their sympathies, with those crackpots and fools whose lack of intelligence and creativity is still the best guarantee of their loyalty.” It is important not to push this argument too far. Johnson’s patent disinterest in the truth does not yet mean we are in a totalitarian state. For that to happen, it is not enough for our leaders to lose respect for the truth. We, the public, must lose this respect as well. We have not yet reached the final stage of Elena Gorokhova’s nightmare where, as the Russian writer put it, our rulers keep lying so “we keep pretending to believe them”. For Arendt, the ideal subject of totalitarian rule was not an ideological fanatic, but rather someone for whom “the distinction between fact and fiction and the distinction between true and false no longer exist”. In other words, the ball is now in our court. It may be that our prime minister has given up on the truth. It may be that his party has given up caring about his giving up on the truth and no longer has the will to remove him. Some people may now argue things such as “despite Partygate, Johnson got the big calls right” or “we can’t remove him in the midst of a war” – so called “greater good” arguments, which have always served as cover for the most toxic abuses. But if we allow ourselves to be seduced by these arguments then we too are giving up, and accepting that the distinction between true and false is only a secondary matter. That is why Partygate still remains a resigning matter, and why the public must call for Johnson’s resignation more loudly than ever.

4/1/2022,"Global migration policy has started to move in a more humane direction in response to the invasion of Ukraine. While many states are welcoming displaced Ukrainians, this is a far cry from how those states typically treat refugees. Activists and scholars have lamented the lack of similar response to people displaced from south Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. The uneven global response to migration on display sets a chilling precedent for the displacement that is likely to come with the climate crisis. Race plays a defining role in how states think about their borders and who gets let in. In the 19th century, racial politics shaped the formation of international law – including how we understand concepts like sovereignty – and legitimized exclusionary policies whose impacts reverberate today. We can see the impact of race on the way in which refugee policy was developed. Drawing on research by T Alexander Aleinikoff, philosopher Serena Parekh explains that refugee flows were primarily east to west (rather than south to north) in the first half of the 20th century. During this period, resettlement was the standard way of helping refugees. When refugee flows from non-European countries increased (from the global south to global north), states changed their policy: instead of resettlement, voluntary repatriation was preferred. What this meant in practice is that refugee camps became the standard way to “rescue” refugees while they waited to return home via voluntary repatriation. It soon became clear that refugee camps did not make voluntary repatriation easier or faster – only about 2% of refugees are voluntarily repatriated annually. But western states chose to keep the practice. Why? According to Aleinikoff, the goal was to “keep third-world refugee problems from inconveniencing the developed states”. Parekh notes that Aleinikoff is not alone here: other scholars, such as Guglielmo Verdirame and Barbara Harrell-Bond, have argued that donor states’ support for refugee camps is intended to protect the boundaries of “Fortress Europe” or “Fortress Australia”. The racial stratification of border policing and migration law is not simply an ignoble history of 20th-century politics, but of our present as well. The Bulgarian prime minister, Kiril Petkov, was straightforward about the double standards of migration policy when he said last month that Ukrainian refugees are “not the refugees we are used to; these people are Europeans”, adding that “there is not a single European country now which is afraid of the current wave of refugees”. Usually, bigotry wears a few more clothes. As the activist and author Harsha Walia points out, xenophobic border politics usually express themselves in ostensibly race-neutral language, engineering or exploiting fears around sexual violence or terrorism. But all the careful rhetoric in the world cannot obscure the plain facts of the matter: however impolitic the statement by Petkov and similar ones by news anchors may have been, they match the actual policy choices that powerful states are making in response to the invasion. Last month, the European Union voted unanimously to accept Ukrainian refugees for up to three years without requiring immediate application for asylum, and US policymakers are likewise considering fast-tracking admission for Ukrainian refugees. The more than 3 million Ukrainians and up to 7 million who may benefit from this policy face a political environment in stark contrast to the ones long felt by African, south Asian and Middle Eastern refugees. Refugees from the “wrong” parts of the world face an increasingly well-resourced system of violence. As American University researcher Tazreena Sajjad details, Europe’s borders now feature more than 1,800km of walls across land and sea to restrict access to the vaunted “freedom of movement” enshrined in the EU’s Charter of Fundamental Rights to the kind of people who do not scare Petkov. Such policies are often coordinated across governments. The EU’s support of the Libyan coast guard encourages deadly militias and a nightmarish “shadow immigration system” in northern Africa, while the US similarly pressures Central American governments to more actively police migrants. Across the world, border surveillance and policing are not merely the province of the state, but also of business: private military security companies extend the reach of state security apparatuses with the help of huge and increasing investments in data management and surveillance technology. This is the climate policy of the powers that be: to funnel money to border militarization, insulating political elites from dealing with the world created by their ongoing refusal to confront the climate crisis, while positioning a few of their number to profit handsomely. We shouldn’t expect the ruling class’s response to future climate-based displacement and migration to be any more equal than their responses have been to migration thus far. Across the world, rightwing politicians fan the flames of xenophobia, sometimes in explicit link to green energy and other climate issues. France’s Marine Le Pen once likened migrants to wind turbines, since “everyone agrees to have them, but no one wants them in their back yard”. In the US, Arizona’s attorney general sued the federal government for failing to protect the environment – by treating immigration as a source of pollution. If these elements of global politics continue to rise in prominence and power, we could end up with “fossil fascism”: a nearly worst-case climate scenario where continued fossil fuel extraction meets heightened ethnonationalism. We need serious climate mitigation and adaptation policies to make sure that people everywhere have resilient support systems, and aren’t immiserated or displaced by disaster in the first place. The more serious we get about that, the smaller the displacement problem. But it is unlikely that we will be able to totally eliminate displacement from our world, so we will also need to have humane and minimally fair global systems of response to migration. How a displaced person is treated and the quality of support they receive should not depend on racial or geopolitical factors. If we have learned anything from the response to the war in Ukraine, it is that we do have the capacity to care for more displaced persons.

4/1/2022,"The former Deloitte partner Carl Hughes has resigned from the board of En+, the mining company part-owned by the sanctioned Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, weeks after defending his decision to remain in the post following Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Hughes, who has served as an independent director of the London-listed company since 2019 and chairs the audit and risk committee, said last month that it was his “fiduciary duty” to stay on. The members of En+ board split $7m (£5.3m) in remuneration in 2020, according to the company’s annual report published last year. His stance had placed him in opposition to British industry bodies including the Institute of Directors, which said it was “untenable” for British directors to remain on the board of Russian companies. Hughes is a former global head of energy and resources at Deloitte, and a member of the General Synod of the Church of England and deputy chairman of the finance committee of the Archbishops’ Council. He joined En+ in January 2019 on the day the US Treasury removed the company from its sanctions blacklist. En+ said at the time its removal was subject to a number of conditions negotiated with the US government, including changing the board so that it was composed of a majority of independent directors. The company, which produces aluminium and power and has 25,000 employees outside Russia including 4,000 in Ukraine, has not been subject to sanctions following the Russian invasion. Last month Greg Barker, the conservative peer and energy minister in David Cameron’s government, resigned as executive chairman of the board of En+. As did Joan MacNaughton, who served as an independent director of the company. En+, which owns Rusal, the biggest aluminium producer outside China, is seeking to carve its international operations out into a new company. These include bauxite mines in Guinea and a refinery in Ireland that produces a raw material for aluminium smelters across Europe. Barker has been linked with a potential senior role at the new company. “The group wishes to emphasise that the strategic review is at a preliminary stage and any future course of action will be subject to further consideration as well as discussions with the relevant regulatory bodies and key stakeholders,” the company said. On Friday, the company reported that revenues rose 36% to $14bn last year, driven by a 45% increase in the price of aluminium on the London Metal Exchange, as net profit more than tripled to $3.5bn. “It is clear that many new challenges lie ahead and we are encouraged by the strength of our resilient business and the determination of our people,” said Chris Burnham, chairman at En+, on Friday. “Due to the tragic developments in Ukraine, we have had to temporarily halt the production at the Nikolaev alumina refinery. Our priority is to ensure the safety of all our employees there and as soon as it becomes possible to safely operate our plant there, we will immediately do so. Meanwhile we will continue to secure stability of supply for our customers and to support our employees and their families.”",News/Business,En+ board member quits after pressure over firm’s Russia links,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/01/en-board-member-quits-after-pressure-over-russia-links-carl-hughes
4/1/2022,"Happy big plate day,” my friend texted our group chat last Friday. After weeks of waiting caused by someone catching a certain virus, we were going to Ciao Bella, an Italian restaurant in central London, renowned for its big portions and even bigger vibes. The last time the three of us ate out together, last summer, we went to a “small plates” restaurant almost by default, as these kinds of places had come to signify going somewhere a bit special, a bit fancy. For the purposes of this article, I’ll define a small plate as anything advertised to be shared, smaller than a main but bigger than one bite of food, priced around £6 to £12. But you know what I’m talking about. You can already picture the Nordic simplicity of the earthenware plate, the pared-back decor of the restaurant, the menu featuring confrontationally blunt options such as “oyster mushrooms”, and nothing so gauche as a pound sign to be seen. The food was delicious but the plates were, well, small. We drank so much, and with such insufficient ballast, that when we went back to my flat, one friend was so drunk she fell on to my television, which smashed all over the floor. So we decided to go to Ciao Bella this time because, we realised after this fun but slightly traumatic event, that – although my TV got replaced – something was missing from our lives. That thing was proper-sized portions. We wanted a starter, a main and a dessert, and to feel almost uncomfortably full at the end. I realised that I hadn’t eaten this way in a restaurant in a long time. Without noticing it I had, for a good decade, been in thrall to small plates. And I was not alone. All over the country, small plates restaurants (often with short names to match) have proliferated, from Noto in Edinburgh to Poco in Bristol, Belfast’s Ora to Manchester’s Erst, and through almost every city in between. I asked other friends how they felt about small plates, and the strength of their feeling surprised me. Those who loved them, loved them for their variety, but the naysayers had a litany of objections, associating them with pretentiousness and feeling confused, ripped off, overwhelmed by choice and often still hungry at the end of a meal. “Why am I gently sawing this croquette into three parts?” my friend Lucy ranted. Another described it as “the Tinder of eating” – loads of choice, but satisfaction by no means guaranteed. Are small plates finally falling from grace? Has Covid had an affect? And how did they become ubiquitous in the first place? “In the 19th century, a lot of dishes would arrive on platters and you would take the bits that you wanted,” says the Observer’s restaurant critic Jay Rayner. “Then we got to this point where the dish was plated, based on the Escoffier system of main dishes which have a piece of animal protein in the middle, and then you build out from that.” This didn’t change in the UK for a long time, except that certain cuisines incorporating shared dishes, such as Chinese and Indian, gained popularity. Plenty of other countries have a tradition of small dishes to share: Japan has izakayas, after-work bars serving snacks; and of course Spain has tapas, the antecedents of small plates. Correctly or not, most observers trace the rise of small plates in the UK to one restaurant: Russell Norman’s Polpo, which opened in Soho, London, in 2009. Miniature pizzas, delicate purple-and-white octopus salads, golden nuggets of potato and parmesan croquette based on Venetian cicchetti, or bar snacks, that Norman had fallen in love with on his many trips to the city. Punters went nuts for it – as did the industry (it’s no coincidence that the popularity of small plates coincided with many restaurants no longer taking bookings – customers could be in and out in an hour). It felt like going for a regular meal – but everything’s small! It was the right trend at the right time. “Post the financial crisis of 2008, people were priced out of being able to open a traditional restaurant,” says food writer George Reynolds, “so you saw the boundary between bars and restaurants becoming more porous, and it felt appropriate to have something closer to a bar snack menu than a full restaurant-y one.” Polpo wasn’t chippy cheap, but it wasn’t crazily expensive, either. “I remember being surprised by the low sticker price of some of the stuff,” Reynolds says. Now, 13 years on, affordability is not something most people associate with small plates – they may have borrowed from the tapas model, but they didn’t borrow its pricing. As they escaped from Polpo and on to menus nationwide, prices – and tempers – rose. Search the archive of any newspaper, this one included, for the term “small plate” and you’ll find plenty of articles denouncing them, and requesting they “go back to the dolls’ houses from which they came”. Writing for the New York Times in 2018, one reviewer described them as “a communal dining experience in the sense that a piranha feast is communal”. Critics routinely complain about having to order them, fit them on the table, look at them, eat them … everything. It became trendy to hate the trend. I ask Jonathan Nunn, editor of food newsletter Vittles, why that happened. He sees it as being more to do with food writing norms than with the dishes themselves: restaurant criticism has historically been a form of satire, where writers reveal zany metropolitan ideas to the wider public by laughing at them. “Small plates offer an easy way for the critic to lightly mock urban affectations and position themselves as ‘not one of them’ despite the fact they obviously are,” he says. But some people do have a genuine resistance to them. “Some older people don’t understand the concept of small plates,” one server at a small-plates restaurant in Margate told me. “It’s a lot of work telling people that they can’t have what they want, in a way that will still make them want to tip you.” Rachel Hendry, who was general manager of a fine dining small-plates restaurant in Wales before 2020, says the task of explaining small plates, night after night, would grind her down. “I see these explanations made fun of by various food writers, but they’ve clearly never been on the receiving end of a furious customer who doesn’t understand the rules of the game. We weren’t allowed to make comparisons to tapas.” One problem is that British culture isn’t very hot on sharing. In a dark, festering corner of our psyche, it’s not OK with us that a dinner consisting of dishes such as, say, three ravioli for a four-person table – might result in someone having a marginally better time for the same portion of the bill. I call a British chef friend who no longer works in the UK. “British people are control freaks,” she says. “For shared plates to work, you’ve got to be not individualistic, and be able to go with the flow. They do maths for the whole meal.” (I can hear her Danish husband yelling in the background: “This is why Brexit happened – you didn’t want to share tapas with the rest of Europe!”) It’s true. I shudder to think of how many £8 dishes of six perfect white beans I’ve sat in front of and thought, “that’s £1.33 per bean”. But are small plates really so dreadful? Or is it that we in the UK approach these meals – and perhaps meals in restaurants generally – with the wrong mindset: one that looks for evidence of a scam? There are some who argue that you don’t actually get less food than you would elsewhere by ordering, say, a starter and a main course. Many agree that the small plates model makes good financial sense for restaurants, though, in that it encourages you to order more, and therefore spend more. And spending a bit more, while never a comfortable prospect, might be what we need to do. Last summer, Rayner wrote a piece pointing out that “most restaurants, weighed down by rents and rates, by ingredients’ costs inflated by the folly of Brexit, by the rutted dysfunction of the British economy, cling to financial viability by their fingertips. Too often it is the underpaid and overworked staff who have borne the brunt.” As Rayner puts it to me: “We very rarely go out to eat because we’re hungry.” So what do we want from a restaurant? Someone else to do the work of feeding us? Somewhere nice to sit with some friends? To eat a spread of dishes we couldn’t make at home? Is the food just an accompaniment for drinking? Whether we think we’re being fleeced often depends on what we think we’re paying for. Generally speaking, small plates work for chefs. With lots of smaller dishes, there is more room for chefs to be creative, to try out things they wouldn’t want to commit to on one of five main courses. They also allow for a cheaper kitchen setup as dishes go out to diners when they’re ready, rather than a table of six needing six main courses at the same time. Charlie Mellor at the Laughing Heart in east London, which opened with a menu of small plates in 2016, says: “I had to be sensible with a very limited budget. I didn’t have money for lots of chefs, and lots of sources of heat to be putting a million things out all at once.” Then there’s Covid. I thought the pandemic might kill off the small, shared plate. But I ask two restaurateurs – James Bates of Liverpool’s Maray and Brodie Meah at Top Cuvée in north London – and neither has noticed a downturn. “Once people are dining out with friends, they feel comfortable enough to share with them,” Bates says. There is hope, though, for the small-plate haters. Reynolds tells me that several establishments in London, such as Black Axe Mangal and Peg, have switched to a prix-fixe menu: a set number of courses with only a few options of each, and the same price whatever you choose. The Laughing Heart has done it, too, partly to guarantee turnover. And with hindsight, Mellor admits that not all food works well as a small plate: “A small plate is delicately composed, and then four people grab a spoon and jump on to it? You might end up missing some key component that balances the dish.” Small plates are not over. But they are evolving. In recent years they’ve escaped the confines of dedicated small-plates restaurants and moved on to menus elsewhere. These days, lots of places won’t divide a menu into starters and mains, but instead expect you to infer the size of a plate from the price. Small plates are still there in all but name, co-opted into way of modern dining. Another development is the even smaller plate, or pintxos-inspired “fancy snack”. “Most cool new restaurants worth their salt will have a dedicated snacks bit at the start of the menu,” Reynolds says. Gemma Bell, a restaurant publicist, says: “Even though it’s not a freebie, it feels like a little treat that you’re getting with your cocktail at the beginning of the meal,” she says. A kofte, a gilda (skewered olive, anchovy and pepper), half a devilled egg: just enough for one mouthful, no sharing required. The greatest fallacy in trend writing is the idea that each new shift washes away what came before. Yes, with some of these small-plates places it’s all too easy to imagine what an elderly relative would make of it – that yes, it’s nice to see you, but they’ve come all this way and only eaten two prawns and a thumb of manchego. But you don’t have to go there. Small plates didn’t replace restaurants with big portions and traditional menu division. All of these modes of eating can coexist. At Ciao Bella, I ate aubergine parmigiana, a steaming heap of seafood pasta dumped into my bowl straight out of a greaseproof bag at the table, and a brick of tiramisù. I was full for most of the next day, and curiously fresh-faced even though the waiter left the bottle of limoncello on our table to polish off at the end. But did it kill my desire ever to eat another small plate as long as I live? To go forever more without a croquette, a padrón pepper, a sliver of ham hock terrine? No. There’s a time and a plate for everything. ",Lifestyle/Food,Still hungry?

4/1/2022,"It appears that Vladimir Putin’s aides have misinformed him about the war, fearful of his reaction. On Wednesday, American officials revealed that, according to American intelligence, Putin’s strict isolation during the pandemic and willingness to publicly castigate advisers have contributed to him getting incomplete or overly optimistic reports about the progress of Russian forces. “We believe he’s being misinformed by his advisers about how badly the Russian military is performing and how the Russian economy is being crippled by sanctions,” Kate Bedingfield, the White House communications director, told reporters. “Because … the senior advisers are too afraid to tell him the truth.” As a result, the attack has been a catastrophe for Putin. He badly overestimated the Russian military and underestimated Ukraine’s capacity to resist. Instead of weakening Nato, his attack has strengthened it. And now that the world’s democracies have cut off Russia’s access to the world banking system, Russia’s economy is in freefall. Dictators like Putin are particularly vulnerable to inaccurate feedback. Instead of independent truth-tellers, they are often surrounded by truth-deniers. Rather than experts and investigative journalists, their world is filled with pseudo-scientists and propaganda. In place of a free press, they have agitprop and disinformation. The higher you rise in any hierarchy, the harder it is to get accurate feedback about your decisions because people are afraid to tell you the truth. I’ve worked with several presidents. All have made big blunders. I’ve also known and written about CEOs of big corporations who have made terrible mistakes. In every case, they had flawed systems for getting useful, accurate and reliable feedback. Donald Trump (whom I didn’t work with, but whose every move I watched) made among the dumbest decisions of any American president in history. Some might say this was inevitable; it was built into Trump’s character. But his key character flaw was his unwillingness to hear anything negative. Trump surrounded himself with toadies and sycophants who didn’t dare tell him the truth. He demanded that everyone around him confirm his preferred self-image of invincibility. His White House was filled with fawning lackeys (he fired anyone who didn’t grovel). He refused to hear bad news. He rejected the validity of negative media coverage. Trump could have accomplished any number of goals far more easily had he not kept digging himself into ever-deeper holes. He was his own worst enemy. Or look at China’s Xi Jinping. Why would he decide to enter into a “no limits” partnership with Moscow on the eve of Putin’s disastrous military campaign? Talk about blunders. Xi’s alliance with Russia has undermined China’s reputation and aggravated concerns among its neighbors about China’s global ambitions. It has already prompted Taiwan to strengthen its defenses and pushed other regional powers such as Australia and Japan to declare their own interests in Taiwan’s security. Trump, Putin, Xi – these men aren’t stupid. What’s stupid is their systems for making decisions. They don’t include naysayers. They have no way of eliciting, recognizing or assessing useful criticism. All are trapped in halls of mirrors that reflect back at them what they want to see and hear. The inverse relation between how high people rise in a hierarchy and the accuracy of the feedback they receive can be overcome if a leader aggressively seeks out dissenting views. But it’s almost impossible to find dissenting views in a totalitarian system where dissent is often punished. One of the great virtues of a democracy is its multiple feedback loops – its many channels for expressing alternative viewpoints and voicing uncomfortable truths. After all, American democracy stopped Trump from doing even more damage than he did. Yet when people like Trump, Putin, and Xi make terrible decisions, the world suffers. The world could even be annihilated.

4/1/2022,"Russia has accused Ukraine of sending attack helicopters across the border to strike an oil storage facility in what would be the first raid on Russian soil since the outbreak of the war if confirmed. Ukraine has not confirmed that it launched the attack, raising questions about whether Russian negligence may be to blame. A Russian governor in the border region of Belgorod said that early on Friday two Ukrainian Mi-24 helicopters crossed the border at low altitude before firing rockets at an oil facility 25 miles from the border. Video posted to social media on Friday appeared to show a helicopter strike using air-to-ground missiles and then a major fire at the facility said to be in Belgorod, with flames reaching dozens of metres into the air. Reports showed that the facility continued to burn until midday on Friday, with dozens of firefighters dispatched to battle the inferno. Other videos showed the helicopters, which are used by both Ukraine and Russia, flying in the region. “The fire at the oil depot occurred as a result of an airstrike from two helicopters of the armed forces of Ukraine, which entered the territory of Russia at low altitude,” said governor Vyacheslav Gladkov. “There are no victims.” An explosion also took place earlier on Thursday at the site of an arms depot in Belgorod, raising speculation that saboteurs were targeting the city, which has served as a major hub for Russian military units involved in the invasion of Ukraine. The Russian news agency Tass reported that four servicemen were injured due to that explosion. The explosions in the Russian rear came after Russia announced it was winding down its offensive toward Kyiv after its troops met heavy resistance in the month-long war. Western officials have warned that Russia may be repositioning its troops for a larger attack on Ukraine’s east.",News/World news,Ukraine accused of helicopter attack on oil depot inside Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/01/ukraine-accused-of-helicopter-attack-on-oil-depot-inside-russia
4/1/2022,"Is the house going to grow chicken legs and run across the stage? It’s not the central dramatic question of this stage adaptation of Sophie Anderson’s highly garlanded YA novel, but it’s what most audiences will wonder. Fortunately, there is much else to distract while that is pondered in a piece packed with fun, exuberant musical numbers, amusingly irreverent performances and inventive theatricality. The novel was inspired by folk tales Anderson was told by her Prussian grandmother and Les Enfants Terribles is the perfect company for this version. Led by adapter and co-director Oliver Lansley, the company’s idiosyncratic style is apt for the story’s milieu. Marinka lives with her grandmother, Baba, a yaga; someone who guards the gate between the living and the dead and guides the recently departed to the other side. The always amusing Lisa Howard adds another impressive comic turn to her CV as Marinka’s grandmother amid a young cast who keep comedic pace with impressive ease. David Fallon as a young Geordie who falls for Marinka is particularly funny and Eve De Leon Allen as Marinka has bags of likability. The production design, Día de los Muertos-chic, isn’t scared to mash styles together, giving us lo-fi (though highly inventive) puppetry alongside projection and good old fashioned storytelling. The piece is overlong, with too much story and a running time that pushes towards three hours, surely a challenge to the target audience’s attention span. It is at its best when it chooses irreverence over sincerity, although it is particularly strong when portraying the exquisite awkwardness of teenage life. And yes, the house grows chicken legs.

4/1/2022,"When the war broke out in the early hours of 24 February, Oleksandr Petrakov, the manager of Ukraine’s men’s national football team, chose not to leave his home in the capital, Kyiv, as the Russians advanced and shells dropped, but to try to join the fight. “My family told me to go to western Ukraine but I refused. I said: ‘I am from Kyiv, I can’t leave,’” says Petrakov. “I didn’t think it would be correct as people have to defend and I can’t run. I thought, if they come to Kyiv I will pick up a weapon and defend my city.” He adds: “I am 64 but I felt it was normal to do this. I think I could take two or three enemies out.” A Russian speaker from childhood, Petrakov now sticks to Ukrainian in public and while some are sad about Vladimir Putin’s war and others are angry, he admits to a more visceral emotion. “It’s just hate. It is not anger, but people hate those who invaded their land. We need time to calm down but for now it is just hate. They have broken our countries for years.” Petrakov tried to sign up to Ukraine’s territorial defence, the reservists being deployed across the country to fight the Russians. He spoke to a member of Ukraine’s government but was advised that his lack of military experience was an issue and that he might be better employed elsewhere. “I was told: ‘You have to sign a contract and someone will command you.’ He said: ‘I know you, that would be very hard. You don’t need this, you are another kind of person.’ And I’m 64, you understand?” Petrakov, who took over from the former Chelsea striker Andriy Shevchenko as manager last August, is instead trying to get Ukraine’s men’s team, for all the horrors of the last five weeks, to this November’s World Cup. The team were due to play Scotland in a play-off qualifier in Hampden Park in Glasgow on 24 March but it was postponed. A new fixture is pencilled in for sometime in June. Petrakov says he believes it will be honoured although there are serious obstacles that he hopes the likes of Uefa and major European clubs such as Manchester United might help him overcome. Competitive football is banned among those between 18 and 60 who can fight, under an order from Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Those who play their football in the domestic league are scattered across the country, unable to train properly. Petrakov initially proposed a training camp for those in the domestic league in the relative safety of western Ukraine. “But there is also shelling in western Ukraine. And if someone says that the national team training camp has started, the enemies could start shelling us. These people are without morals, or principles, and we couldn’t risk our players. The Russians are not our brothers, they are the horde.” The Ukrainian football association is instead on Petrakov’s advice trying to arrange with Uefa both a camp outside of Ukraine, possibly in the UK, and friendly fixtures with the likes of “Bayern Munich, Manchester United, Manchester City, Arsenal”, with the proceeds of the games going to support the Ukrainian armed forces. Petrakov says he has 11 players in his squad playing outside Ukraine, including the Premier League, but 26 inside who need match practice. “We could play at Wembley, for example, against a London club. It could be a good exhibition game, a response for the Ukrainian army, as well as preparatory work for the Scotland game.” Petrakov says he needs five or six games to return his team to fitness. “We have to play because without the [practice] games, it would be very hard to get to play with Scotland,” he says. He has weekly phone calls with players including the West Ham winger Andriy Yarmolenko and Manchester City’s midfielder Oleksandr Zinchenko. “They’re calling to me, saying please be safe, we couldn’t bear it if you were killed. You’re staying in dangerous zone. But it is easier here. If I were there, it would be harder. Mostly, all the parents of these players are staying in Ukraine. The players worry.” Other players and ex-internationals have joined in the fighting, including Andriy Bogdanov, 32, and Oleksandr Aliyev, 37. The idea of Ukraine playing Russia on the football field again is anathema to Petrakov. “I wouldn’t want this to happen while I am still alive. I don’t [want] to shake hands with these guys … We have to build a great wall and do what we can do to separate from them.” Petrakov, who won the under-20 World Cup for Ukraine in 2019, is full of admiration for Zelenskiy’s leadership. “When we won the cup, he had become president and he called up and I didn’t even know his name and surname. I just called him ‘my president’, says Petrakov, laughing. But the war rages on. Petrakov’s daughter, Viktoria, 32, and son Yevhen, 41, and his four-year-old grandson are in relative safety in the west of the country. But in their flat in Kyiv, his wife, Irina, 66, struggles with the sounds of war. “She can’t bear the shelling and explosions and at 8pm she goes down to the shelter with the dog. I stay in the flat. It would be better for me to fight somebody if I could.”",News/World news,"‘We could play at Wembley’: Ukraine manager on war, the World Cup and his hatred of Russia",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/01/ukraine-football-manager-oleksandr-petrakov-war-world-cup-hatred-russia
4/1/2022,"Louis McKechnie is the face that launched a thousand British football memes. In March, the 21-year-old caused a stop to play when he ran onto the pitch at Goodison Park during a match between Everton and Newcastle and zip-tied himself to a goalpost by his neck.If anything could have enraged the 40,000 jeering football fans more, it was the solemnity with which he did it. But while for many the episode will have merely been jotted down as another entry in the annals of absurdity, his cause was deadly serious. A day earlier, Maddie, 21, and Kai, 20 – who did not give their surnames – attempted to stage a similar action at Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium in north London. Kai took a long pause and looked around him at the slowly filling stands before describing how he felt about what they had planned.“Every single second I spend here, I want to do what I’m going to do less, because I can see everyone just trying to have a nice time,” he said. “But I know it’s what is right; I know that it has to happen.” Fuel to the fireLouis, Maddie and Kai are all young activists with a climate group called Just Stop Oil. They have called on the UK government to halt all new fossil fuel projects in order to avoid the worst effects of climate change. If their efforts fail, they intend to paralyse the supply chain themselves, using non-violent direct action to disrupt the strategic oil and gas infrastructure that keeps the UK moving.The ambition is big. “We are mobilising upwards of 1,000 people,” one JSO activist told the Guardian. “This is going to be a fusion of other large-scale blockade-style actions you have seen in the past.”Just Stop Oil say they are taking inspiration from UK lorry drivers’ protests in 2000, when, furious at a rise in fuel duty, hauliers and farmers staged blockades that paralysed petrol distribution. Hundreds of petrol stations ran dry, leading to empty shelves in supermarkets, delays to mail deliveries and schools being closed. Protests ended after the government said it would order soldiers to secure deliveries, but they won: then-chancellor Gordon Brown announced in that year’s budget that fuel duty would be frozen.But where 20 years ago those protesters enjoyed public support in their campaign against rising prices, Just Stop Oil’s target is the fossil fuel system itself. While polling shows large majorities regard the climate as one of the most important issues of the moment, it’s unclear whether that understanding would continue if the pumps were empty.At a recruitment meeting last Thursday in Camden, north London, Larch Maxey, a veteran eco-campaigner, said the aim was “to build a community of civil resistance in response to the climate change science”.“In 2022 you have got tens of thousands of peer-reviewed papers spelling out the climate science,” he said. Authorities such as David Attenborough and David King, the former government chief science officer, were in agreement, he said: there is a narrow window of two to three years in which to act. “We are facing the end of civilisation if we do not act on the climate emergency. We are heading towards societal collapse.“When your house is on fire, you stop pouring petrol on the flames,” he said. “That’s basically the demand – no new licences. We are in a crisis. Let’s stop digging out new oil and gas.” New kids on the blockadeJust Stop Oil doesn’t just share rhetoric with Extinction Rebellion, it sits within an arc of escalation that began with that group’s blockades of five Thames bridges in 2018. Since then, the environmental movement has continued to explore new non-violent tactical provocations to draw attention to its demands.Many of those involved are, like Maxey, veterans of XR and the HS2 protests; McKechnie is one of a number who took action with Insulate Britain. As with those groups, the silhouette of Roger Hallam also looms behind Just Stop Oil. Although the Guardian has been told it is wrong to describe Hallam as the mastermind of this latest campaign, he featured prominently in early coverage of its activities.The key shift in Just Stop Oil is what its supporters say is a move from civil disobedience and into civil resistance. What that means, as Jess Causby, 25, a supporter of the campaign, told the Guardian last month, “is stopping pointing out what the government should or shouldn’t be doing [and instead] actively stopping government doing what they shouldn’t be.”The question is whether they can pull it off. The record of actions attended by Guardian reporters has not immediately seemed propitious. Young activists who tried to storm the red carpet at the Baftas two weeks ago misjudged how difficult it would be to reach, and ended up blocking its road-entrance instead. Kai and Maddie were intercepted before they could prove a nuisance at Arsenal. A small group who tried to disrupt play at Tottenham were also swiftly handled.Their next plan is to tackle a much bigger target, and they can expect to be anticipated. Oil companies have already begun to make preparations. What will happen next remains to be seen.
