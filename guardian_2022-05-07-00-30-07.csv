5/7/2022,"Spring break fever has overtaken Formula One. It has Charles Leclerc playing catch with the Marlins’ Jazz Chisholm Jr, Lewis Hamilton teeing off with Tom Brady and Daniel Ricciardo and Lando Norris chasing James Corden around the paddock in cutoff team shirts. It could only happen in Miami. And it’s a wonder it hasn’t happened sooner. This weekend F1 will stage its first ever race in Miami as the US plays host to a pair of Grand Prix races for the first time since 1984, when the series touched down in Detroit and Dallas. But this time, rather than return to Motown or Moo Town, F1 has parked its massive traveling circus here, to the land of white sand beaches, neon lights and withering heat. And the local buzz isn’t simply a product of the town’s strongly poured daiquiris and mojitos. It’s yet another breakthrough moment for a sport that has long struggled to crack the US market. And even though F1’s embrace of social media, Netflix’s Drive to Survive and Sky Sports’ cracking TV coverage (via ESPN) has played a big part in winning over viewers across the pond, many of whom couldn’t have cared less about motorsports to begin with, it is curious that F1’s American seduction didn’t start in Miami – America’s exotic foreign getaway. Instead, it bounced across the coasts, tarried in Middle America and blew up in Indianapolis – and not in the good way. (Austin, however, is cool, weird and succeeded in entrenching F1 in the States.) The closest the series ever got to Miami was Sebring, Florida, a fabled inland racing venue three hours north that served as the backdrop for the one-off 1959 US Grand Prix. But of course that was before the Americans at Liberty Media took over F1 in 2017 with the goal of making the global behemoth nationally relevant. While Long Beach, Watkins Glen and other long-ago US Grand Prix sites have their charm, Miami has always been the closest thing America has had to a true F1 city. It’s cosmopolitan, seedy and a playground for a fair few celebrities – Hamilton, not least. There’s a culture of wretched excess, of flashy cars and of racing between stop lights. Miami’s shimmering coastline has all the heady trappings: big yachts, tanned bods, colorful deco architecture and water that’s quite literally laced with prescription drugs. IndyCar raced here back in the ‘80s and ‘90s, Nascar staged its season finale in nearby Homestead for almost two decades and Formula E raced around Biscayne Bay in 2015. Really, you’d be hard pressed to find a more postcard-perfect venue for an F1 race. With Las Vegas on the schedule for next year, clearly this is just the tip of F1’s American expansion. Still, Miami wouldn’t be Miami if it didn’t also traffic in illusion. Despite Formula 1 fighting for a downtown race along the city’s iconic waterfront, it wound up a half-hour north of downtown in Miami Gardens, the bedroom community that is home to the Miami Dolphins’ Hard Rock Stadium; ultimately, an influential neighborhood association couldn’t vibe to this new Miami Sound Machine of noise pollution and traffic bottlenecks. (Formula E cars, with their near-silent electric motors, at least got around the first concern.) The race itself will follow a makeshift 5.4km street circuit around the stadium, under a highway overpass that will surely grind to a halt once things go green down below. In an effort to bring more of that Tubbs and Crockett flavor to the race – fittingly sponsored by a cryptocurrency firm, as Miami angles to become the Wall Street of blockchain – organizers added a pool area, two stories of cabanas and a fake yacht marina that looks like something out of Minecraft. But it isn’t just the normos who are embracing the artifice, typical Miami. Michael Jordan, LeBron James and Pharrell are also expected to roll through. Seven years ago, at the US Grand Prix in Austin, Hamilton was openly puzzling over how to get Americans into Formula 1 in a pre-race news conference. Taking in the scene here at a sponsor event earlier this week, he called the Miami GP “a dream”. But not everyone is caught up in the revelry. Miami Gardens, the largest Florida city with a majority Black population, has been dreading the arrival of this motorsport Super Bowl ever since their attempts to ship the race elsewhere were thwarted three years ago. In 2020 a group of residents led by former Miami-Dade County commissioner Betty Ferguson sued Formula One, Hard Rock Stadium, the Dolphins and ex-Miami-Dade mayor Carlos Gimenez for racial discrimination. “This is environmental racism,” Ferguson declared, “pure and simple.” Last May a recall election was sought to remove council members who voted to bring the race to Miami Gardens. (In the end the recall effort failed to draw the requisite number of signatures to initiate a vote.) Worse than those lawmakers getting into bed with F1, residents felt as if they had agreed to a bad deal – one that promised only $5m in community benefits and 5% of revenues to the city. So figure about $25m altogether. What’s more, Miami Gardens residents are locked into this deal for a decade, with F1 president Stefano Domenicali promising to leave “a positive and lasting contribution for the people in the local community”. Never mind that aggrieved residents have vowed to fight on. It’s an undercurrent of controversy that puts Miami squarely in league with Sochi, Saudi Arabia and other dubious F1 crash pads. So it figures that a Grand Prix would finally wind up here. Hamilton’s neon dream is more than a rowdy carnival of serious F1 escapists now. It’s a proper homecoming.",Sport/Sport,F1 touches down in US for Miami GP amid undercurrent of controversy,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/06/miami-grand-prix-controversy-residents
5/7/2022,"Dave Eggers, author of dystopian satire The Circle, has said he will provide free copies of his novel to schools in South Dakota, as well as copies of four other books that have been banned in the district’s schools. School administrators in Rapid City thought The Circle, along with How Beautiful We Were by Imbolo Mbue, Fun Home by Alison Bechdel, The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky and Booker prize-winning Girl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo, inappropriate for pupils. The district’s schools’ copies have been marked as surplus and are due to be destroyed. Valerie Brablec Seales, Rapid City Area Schools’ director of teaching, learning and innovation, told the board of education that teachers had requested the books for a new 12th-grade English course. The first concerns about one of the five books were raised in August, the Rapid City Journal reported. “The mass destruction of books by school boards is an unconscionable horror, and the freethinking young people of South Dakota shouldn’t be subjected to it,” Eggers said. “Every high school student should have unfettered access to literature, so if you’re a Rapid City high school senior, email our office and ask for any of these titles. For every copy the school board destroys, let’s add a new one to the local circulation.” Eggers, who founded non-profit publishing company McSweeney’s in 1988, is known for standing up for his principles. He refused to sell the hardback edition of The Every, his sequel to The Circle, via Amazon, in a stand against the retailer’s monopoly on the book trade. Students can email McSweeney’s executive director Amanda Uhle at amanda@daveeggers.net if they wish to be sent any of the banned books, with the titles to be shipped by independent bookstores. Bernardine Evaristo shared Book Riot’s article about Rapid City’s ban of her book on Twitter, commenting: “Girl, Woman, Other is unsuitable reading material for 17-18 year olds, apparently, and is on a list of books to be banned in South Dakota ‘all of which are by or about people of color and/or queer people’. Funny that.” Alison Bechdel also took to Twitter to discuss the “book banning madness”, thanking Eggers and Uhle for their plan to fight back.",Arts/Books,Dave Eggers offers to replace books a South Dakota school board wants to pulp,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/06/dave-eggers-offers-replace-books-south-dakota-school-board-pulp
5/7/2022,"A private prison company that ran an “inadequate” youth jail made £11m in the same year inspectors raised serious safety concerns about the welfare of children, some of whom were locked up alone for more than 23 hours a day. Soaring profits, described as “tragic” by Labour, were disclosed in accounts filed by the US-owned Management & Training Corporation (MTC), which was awarded a £50m contract from the Ministry of Justice in 2016 to run the Rainsbrook secure training centre in Warwickshire. Profits jumped from less than £1m to £11m in 2020, the year before its contract with the MoJ was terminated 17 months early after a string of damning reports by Ofsted inspectors. MTC said most of its profit came from its probation services in London and Thames Valley, not Rainsbrook. It said staffing levels had been more than adequate at the centre. The accounts for its UK operations, which were filed at Companies House this week, also showed the company had since switched to running “migrant quarantine hotels”, using staff redeployed from Rainsbrook, after it was approached by the Home Office and asked to help deliver the services. These quarantine hotels house adult asylum seekers who have arrived in the UK by small boats, when the short-term holding facilities meant to accommodate them are full up. Conditions at Rainsbrook, near Rugby, sparked “serious concerns” among Ofsted inspectors, after it emerged children at young as 15 were being locked up for more than 23 hours a day with “no justifiable rationale” during the coronavirus pandemic. All children were removed from Rainsbrook in June 2021, after subsequent inspections raised further safety issues, including the carrying of weapons and warnings from staff and children that someone was likely to die at the centre. Some of the children were sent to adult prisons as a result. Low staffing levels at Rainsbrook, which had capacity for 87 children between 12 and 17, were cited among the reasons for its problems in successive reports by Ofsted in 2020 and 2021. One report said: “Poor staffing levels and poor supervision of children enable children to bully and intimidate each other. Physical assaults between children are common, and work to resolve these conflicts is minimal.” Utah-based MTC, which says it champions a “bionic” (believe it or not, I care) culture, has previously been criticised for understaffing a prison in its network of private correctional facilities in the US. Its UK division acknowledged problems with low staffing levels in its results for the 12 months to the end of December 2020, a period in which inspectors sounded the alarm about Rainsbrook three times. During that period, the company recorded an increase in profits from £644,000 to £11m, with its highest-paid director earning £234,000.A National Audit Office report last month revealed the government entered into negotiations to pay MTC up to £1.8m in settlement costs over the loss of the Rainsbrook contract, with the company agreeing to meet £244,098 in maintenance costs. The government also paid MTC £5.6m a month while it negotiated the terms of the contract termination. This was £1.5m less than normal monthly payments because some MTC staff were redeployed under the quarantine hotel contract. The NAO said the sums could be described as “fruitless payments” because no children were housed at Rainsbrook during the period. MTC’s 2020 results were temporarily boosted by the government’s decision to renationalise the probation service, backtracking on a disastrous privatisation programme led by the former justice secretary Chris Grayling. The early termination of MTC’s two private probation contracts inflated revenues by £4.3m to £107.6m, as payments that would have been due in the remaining years of the contracts were brought forward. Ellie Reeves, the shadow minister for prisons and probation, said: “It is tragic that taxpayer’s money goes towards massive salaries of directors of companies like MTC while children in their charge are locked in their rooms for 23-and-a-half hours a day.” She said the government had wasted £4.1bn on Grayling’s “catastrophic” transforming rehabilitation plan to privatise the probation service, which had been left “a shell of its former self”. MTC said most of its profit came from its probation services in London and Thames Valley, not Rainsbrook. It said staffing levels had been more than adequate at the centre. “While we experienced significant challenges at Rainsbrook STC, we had a strong record in delivering probation services before they were renationalised, along with all other areas in England and Wales in 2020,” it said. “In London, inspectors commended our sustained improvements to previously failing services and in Thames Valley our service was rated ‘good’.” Commenting on MTC’s role in the quarantine hotels, a Home Office spokesperson said: “We expect all our providers to ensure that accommodation provided to asylum seekers is safe, comfortable and meets our standards of service. “MTC work is assured by the Home Office on a regular basis and they have consistently proven to be a diligent partner in dealing with vulnerable migrant arrivals.” The Guardian has approached the MoJ for comment.",News/Business,Prison firm made £11m in year Ofsted raised alarm about safety at youth jail,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/06/prison-firm-made-pounds-11m-year-ofsted-raised-alarm-about-safety-youth-jail-rainsbrook
5/7/2022,"Odesa is being shelled from the sea and from the territory of Russia, but people do not panic. They live almost normal lives. Like all Ukrainians, they have just celebrated grobki, or “little graves”. These are what we call the special days in spring when we honour the memory of deceased relatives and friends. At this time, all Ukraine dedicates itself to the care of graves in the cemeteries. Some people from Odesa will have removed the old foliage from the graves and also repaired monuments and fences destroyed or damaged by Russian missiles. Many cemeteries in Ukraine have been destroyed or damaged by Russian troops, including Kyiv’s Berkovtsy Cemetery, near Tupoleva Street, where I grew up. Some cemeteries have been bombed; others have been run over by Russian tanks and armoured personnel carriers (APCs). Russian sappers have also left booby-traps in many of them. The authorities tried to persuade Ukrainians this year not to visit those cemeteries that were, or are still, being occupied by the Russian army. However, Ukrainians are used to doing not what they are told but what they consider necessary. They still went to tidy the graves of their relatives. The church has often asked Ukrainians not to bring plastic flowers to the graves and to bring live ones instead, but still many Ukrainians bring plastic ones. Because they don’t fade. Some Ukrainians will surely have tried to go where they were allowed only once a year before the war – to cemeteries in the closed Chernobyl zone. There are dozens of cemeteries near the villages and towns that were evacuated after the disaster of 1986. Previously, former residents of these places and their relatives visited from all over Ukraine to mark the anniversary of the disaster, and on “little graves” days. But this year, visiting the Chernobyl zone was strictly prohibited. The Russian army captured the Chernobyl station and the area around it for more than a month. During that time, they paved a road to Kyiv through the radioactive territory, and about 10,000 tanks, APCs and other military equipment travelled along it, carrying thousands of soldiers towards what they hoped would be their triumphant entry into the capital. Now the Russians are gone and only the radiation is left. Russians returned through Belarus, and from there they shipped home to towns and villages all over Russia the things they had stolen from Ukrainian homes – washing machines, computers, scooters, even children’s toys. Perhaps this would have been forgotten by now, had it not been for Chernobyl. Shortly after the Russian military left the Chernobyl zone for Belarus, there were reports that some soldiers began to feel ill. Several people went to doctors. An investigation showed that they were all suffering from exposure to radiation. After that, the Belarusian KGB launched its own investigation – which will, no doubt, lead nowhere. After all, Belarus is already a territory that is de facto controlled by Russia. The International Atomic Energy Agency says it is aware of the reports that Russian troops may have been exposed to radiation, but so far it has been unable to verify them. For Russia now, it’s not important how much radiation its soldiers brought to Belarus, or how much they sent in parcels to their relatives. It’s also not important that military equipment that has twice passed through the Chernobyl zone could have become a source of radiation affecting Russian soldiers in action. For Russia, the lives of these soldiers are not important either. In all likelihood they will die on the battlefield, not in hospital from radiation sickness. If this equipment remains on Ukrainian territory, it will become a dangerous source of radiation for people living there, who will be its next victims. And again the number of fresh graves will increase in Ukrainian cemeteries. And even more people will come to the cemeteries between late April and the beginning of May to remember their dead on “little graves” days. Ukrainians will come to the cemeteries with picnic baskets and bags, sitting on the ground near the graves or at special tables dug into the ground next to the fences around the graves. They will make commemorative toasts and drink. These traditions are stronger than shelling and occupation. War or no war, they must go on. The war may even strengthen such traditions. Putin would like to kill Ukrainian traditions. Then it would be easier for him to say that Ukrainians do not exist – that they are just Russians who were deceived, who were told they were not Russians but Ukrainians. But war kills only people. Traditions remain, and they cement national identity.

5/7/2022,"One by one the families have come forward. Some had studied the video frame by frame to identify their loved one. Others knew in an instant that one of the men being murdered in the Tadamon massacre was their family member who had vanished nine long years ago. Ten days after the Guardian revealed the massacre carried out and filmed by Syrian forces in a suburb of Damascus, a fuller picture is emerging of the men who were killed, and unusually outspoken family members are demanding answers of a rattled Syrian regime – which has released a few hundred prisoners in an apparent attempt to quell the outcry. A total of six men shown in their last moments of life in the gruesome video have now been identified. Many were Palestinians from the nearby Yarmouk refugee camp. Several more were local residents. Their families have little clue about why they were captured. But for the first time since the outset of the war, officials are under pressure to provide responses to a seething Syrian street. Regime reaction so far has been to offer concessions; an amnesty law for terrorism offences that did not involve killing, an anti-torture law passed by decree, which many in Damascus feel is almost mocking them, and a new defence minister, who has no ties to the security machine accused of directing the slaughter in Tadamon. The first prisoner release did not go quite to plan, if indeed it was the regime’s intent to represent a new benevolent side, when up to 20 men were dropped off from a prison truck in a central Damascus square on Tuesday. Their faces gaunt, skin pallid and eyes staring vacantly into the middle distance, the men looked like human wrecks, pale imitations of the photos held by family members who wept as they received them. All week a vigil ensued, with thousands lining the streets of the Syrian capital waiting for those incarcerated in Bashar’s dungeons – in this case, the infamous Sednaya prison on the outskirts of the capital. Family members of the Tadamon victims, meanwhile, were finally able to hold vigils of their own, for men they had long believed were lost in the darkness of Sednaya. Among them were the parents of Wasim Siyam. “I was expecting everything, that he’d have lost an eye, that he’d have been tortured, but I wasn’t expecting that they do this to him, it’s the absolutely worst,” his mother told the al-Araby network. “I thought he was held by the regime. He left the house at 6am. I gave him his clothes, I had them hanging to dry, he wore them and I told him: please don’t go. At 12.40 his phone dropped off the cell network. We asked the government for a family record and they had him down as alive. Justice must be served.” Siyam’s father told Orient TV he recognised his son by the way he ran: “My friend who lives in the Netherlands sent me this video and I watched it once, twice, three times and I noticed one of them ran in a familiar way and it was my son.” Siyam was 33 years old when he was murdered and had two daughters, who are now 15 and 13. His father told Orient Radio of having to tell his granddaughters. “On Monday, on the first day of Eid … their grandma showed [the daughters] the video and told them: this is your father. I used to lie to them and tell them that their dad was alive and working. One of them would tell me: ‘OK but I just succeeded in my exams, isn’t he going to come and get me a present?’” A Facebook page, Yarmouk Camp News, carried more news about Siyam. A school friend, Rami Jalbout, who is now a lawyer, said: “He was hard-working. His grandfather owned the bakery and he used to work in it, he lived above it. He had a very special laugh and was a very kind person.” The next three victims identified were the Turkmen Syrians Shaman al-Daher and his sons, Omar and Mutlaq. Omar and Shaman were identified being executed by family members who refused to provide their names to the website Zaman al-Wasl. They also identified Mutlaq, whom they said was already dead in the pit. Shaman was 63 years old and was arrested with his sons during a raid on his house on 16 April 2013, the day of the massacre. The fifth victim identified was Louay al-Kabra, another resident of the Yarmouk refugee camp, according to the Action Group for the Palestinians of Syria. Louay was a first responder and had been reported missing earlier that month. Said Ahmad Khattab, a barber, 27, was another Palestinian victim from Yarmouk. A friend said on Twitter that he was the grandson of a leader of a 1936 Palestinian revolt against the Ergun. “Today, 74 years after that massacre, I forced myself to watch this video … and saw Said the grandson get executed the same way his grandfather was but this time by Arabs who claim they are resistance.” Yarmouk had been long held up by the Syrian regime as a showpiece to its commitment to the Palestinian cause. But regime raids later in 2013 forced most of its residents into exile, some for a second time. Many remain in Lebanon, afraid to return. Prof Uğur Ümit Üngör, from the University of Amsterdam’s Institute of Genocide and Holocaust Studies, who revealed the massacre along with his colleague, Annsar Shahhoud, said the overwhelming reaction to the revelations had left him feeling ambivalent. “You don’t want to re-traumatise people and cause more suffering, but on the other hand there’s no point keeping bad news from people,” he said. “So it’s the lesser evil, that’s a thin consolation but it’s all I have. “I cannot and do not want to imagine the feelings of those family members the very moment they saw the video and recognised their loved ones. I just hope this research puts an end to the horrific feeling of endless waiting for a disappeared, and hopefully they can mourn the person now.”",News/World news,‘He ran in a familiar way’: heartbreak as families identify Tadamon victims,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/06/he-ran-in-a-familiar-way-heartbreak-as-families-identify-tadamon-victims
5/7/2022,"When it comes to misguided attempts at humour, The Fiver considers itself something of an authority. After all, they are our stock-in-trade and we’ve been churning out tin-eared attempts at “satire” on an almost-daily basis for more than 20 years now, spectacularly failing to read a global room that expects more from its free tea-timely email than a series of lazy national stereotypes, unimaginative nicknames and a litany of impenetrable, unfunny in-jokes that are so old not even we can remember why they were originally supposed to be funny. So while we don’t condone David Moyes’s actions in trying (and mercifully failing) to smash a football at a timewasting ballboy’s head during West Ham’s Big Vase semi-final defeat at the hands of Eintracht Frankfurt, we can understand his frustration towards the end of a tie in which, almost to a man, his players failed to give a good account of themselves. Semi-finals in Big Vase or any other tournament don’t come around too often for teams like West Ham, so if you’re going to lose one you might as well go out swinging haymakers rather than with an uninspired whimper. Speaking about the incident after the game, Moyes was quick to apologise but succeeded only in making matters worse by trying to crack wise. “I have to apologise for kicking the ball,” he sighed. “But the ball boy left it short and it was nicely on the volley for me.” Despite performing in front of the most generous audience in comedy – football journalists who will generally laugh uproariously at any feeble attempt at press conference humour – Moyes’s gag was greeted with toe-curling silence and tumbleweed, at which point he apologised again without attempting to mine the moment for ill-advised yuks. Meanwhile in Scotland, a packed Ibrox roared on the Pope’s Newc O’Rangers as they booked their place in the final against Frankfurt, overwhelming RB Leipzig to go through by the odd goal of five over two legs. Decidedly unpopular in Germany, Leipzig are no strangers to hostile Bundesliga atmospheres but they had no answer for O’Rangers, who dedicated their victory to Jimmy Bell, their kit man of over 30 years who died suddenly following last Sunday’s Old Firm derby. Clearly distraught by the sudden loss of a dressing-room morale-booster, whose duties extended far beyond the simple laying out of kit, the players staged a minute’s silence, wore black armbands in Bell’s honour and spoke extremely fondly of him after the game. “Words can’t describe how much Jimmy meant to all of us,” said John Lundstram, who scored the winner. “He was the bedrock of the club and touched everyone. I just want to dedicate my goal to him, I absolutely love him to bits.” May Jimmy rest in peace. “Why did I shed a tear? Because I feel what they all feel.

5/7/2022,"What kind of man is it possible to be? That is Amy Conroy’s probing question in her 2015 play, which places gender identity at the heart of a family drama. Returning to Ireland for the imminent death of his father, Mark – who used to be Laura – has no wish to think fondly of big Ted. As they sit in the hospital room, Mark (Riley Carter) and his gay brother Gary (Ross O’Donnellan) recall growing up in Ted’s domineering shadow. But their childhood friend Sullivan (Jamie O’Neill) contradicts their sour recollections, defending the man who was a father figure to him. The threat of violence hovers in the air, while the deathbed setting and twist on the father-son theme allow for some scorching truth-telling, as the sarcastic Gary and blunt Sullivan struggle to accept Mark’s new gender identity. Although performed with pent-up energy by O’Donnellan and O’Neill, the two men appear less as fully realised characters than as alternative versions and cliches of masculinity to which Mark can react. Carter’s Mark makes the most of his Mamet-esque dialogue: firing off one-liners, he deliberately goads the other two, pacing around them. Describing a parodic version of Gary’s gay lifestyle and Sullivan’s marital compromises, he seems to be testing possibilities for his own life. Tamping down some of the humour of the script’s banter, director Wayne Jordan sets a sombre tone for this production, amplified by the grey-browns of designer Sarah Bacon’s backdrop, evoking the cold Atlantic waters nearby. Here the underlying note is of grief: over damage, and wasted potential. Slowly shifting to a shared childhood memory of trauma, the play’s emotional layers create an affecting finale in which Mark’s struggle for self-knowledge brings new courage and insight.

5/7/2022,"JJ Redick’s emergence as a rising star for ESPN since joining the network as a basketball analyst in October has been one of the more notable stories in US sports media over the past year. The 37-year-old Redick, who launched a popular podcast while he was still a player, spent 15 seasons in the NBA after a decorated four-year stint at Duke, where he was the consensus national college basketball player of the year in 2006. He’s brought the keen insight and deep knowledge of an ex-pro to the broadcasting booth, but it’s been his regular appearances on ESPN’s breakfast-time debate show First Take that have made the biggest splash. There’s nothing extraordinary about Redick’s sober, rational analysis except as an antidote for the incentivized buffoonery of the sports-shouting programs that ESPN has made the cornerstone of its daytime programming since the mid-aughts. And the contrast that his presence creates between the old-school talking head and the newer, fresher type of pundit was on full display this week during one memorable exchange that has since gone viral. The gasbag of the scene is Chris Russo, a longtime New York sports-talk radio shock jock known as Mad Dog (yes, really) who began making weekly appearances on First Take this year. Above a chyron posing the question “Problem with how Draymond has carried himself?”, Russo groused over Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green’s ejection from Game 1 of the Western Conference semi-finals against the Grizzlies for a flagrant-two foul and his subsequent flipping-off of the Memphis crowd after he was bloodied by an elbow to the face during Game 2. “He’s hard to root for,” Russo said. “Just shut up and play, will you please? America is tired of Draymond Green. I deal with him constantly. The fans, San Francisco fans, are a different story.” He doubled down moments later for anyone who couldn’t detect the subtlety on first pass, stressing that all of America was “tired” of Green’s antics: “Just be quiet and play. We all know he has a great skill set for that team but who in the world is sitting there; he’s so polarizing, I can’t root for him.” It didn’t take long for the visibly annoyed Redick, who heard the rightwing dog whistle like an ambulance siren, to clap back. “I want to take a little umbrage with this ‘shut up and play’ because that has the same sort of connotations that the ‘shut up and dribble’ crowd has towards athletes and I have a real problem with that,” Redick said. “Specifically with Draymond [and] the idea that America is tired of him. You do realize the guy has a very popular podcast where he hosts and he talks, himself, for the majority of the episode and people listen to that.” Redick went on: “He signed a talent deal with Turner [Sports] because people want to hear what Draymond has to say. The reason they want to hear what Draymond has to say is because – just like in this press conference – he is real, authentic, and unfiltered. You can’t take away what makes a player great so there’s no shut up and play.’” Russo backtracked, insisting it was “not a political scenario or race situation” and that he was speaking for millions of fans who are put off by the “polarizing” Green’s on-court antics. But Redick didn’t let him off the hook, firing back: “I’m not saying it’s a race situation. I’m saying the fans you’re talking about, they talk about athletes that way like you just talked about an athlete. The people on Fox News talk about athletes that way, that’s my issue.” Redick concluded: “I don’t actually care about the fans that watched Bob Cousy play or watched Wilt [Chamberlain] play. I don’t care! I appreciate they’ve been NBA fans that long but I don’t appreciate the undertone.” The back-and-forth was the latest skirmish in a simmering generational war between millennials and boomers on NBA soil and the result was beyond dispute. Green himself was first in line to give Redick his flowers, but the ultimate co-sign soon followed when LeBron shared the video clip in his Instagram story beneath the caption: “JJ FOR PRESIDENT!!” Redick’s nearly uniform popularity as a pundit is even more noteworthy considering where he first became a household name. Few things bring Americans together like rooting against Duke, where Redick became one in a long line of high-profile, typically white villains that includes Christian Laettner, Steve Wojciechowski, Grayson Allen and Jon Scheyer, all loathed as much for a perceived sense of entitlement as their on-court exploits. But unlike countless former pros who transition into broadcasting with little more than a name as their credentials, Redick has worked hard at his craft and it’s shown as he continues to shatter perceptions of himself and the wills of his older, lazier colleagues. Whether it augurs the end of the risible “Embrace Debate” ethos that has filled our screens with cartoonish, over-the-top personalities screaming at one another, it’s too soon to say. But if simply coming off like a human being and approaching these panels with intellectual honesty is all it takes to clear the bar, then more people should try it.",Sport/Sport,‘JJ for president’: How Redick became LeBron and the NBA’s favorite pundit,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/may/06/jj-redick-chris-russo-espn-first-take
5/7/2022,"The fires are being stoked even before Age of Rage has started. Flames are fanned at the back of the stage while a gauzy screen with a luminous family tree flashes the names of ancient gods and royals. Zeus. Agamemnon. Tantalus. Clytemnestra. They zoom toward us like the opening credits for an action-packed movie. Ivo van Hove’s makeover of ancient Greek tragedy, combining stories by Euripides and Aeschylus and produced by Internationaal Theater Amsterdam, turns out to be every bit as high-octane as these initial optics suggest. Age of Rage is not without its failings; at almost four hours long it is wildly messy, with some clunky elements in the text (adapted by Koen Tachelet and Van Hove, translated from Dutch to English by Gerard Koolschijn). But it brings ancient Greek tragedy exploding into our times. The story, featuring the fall of Troy and the house of Atreus, shows how the curse of war, the addictions of anger and revenge, the trappings of power and the abnegation of blame are still with us, all these centuries on. The characters look small and insignificant as Agamemnon (Hans Kesting) and Menelaus (Gijs Scholten van Aschat) emerge in contemporary clothing (baggy trousers and tops) and Clytemnestra (Chris Nietvelt) saunters on in a sequined dress and stiletto boots. It all feels tame until the sacrifice of Iphigenia (Ilke Paddenburg) – to which Agamemnon agrees in exchange for progress in Greece’s war against Troy. Her throat slit, Iphigenia resembles a dangling dead animal. The theatrical pyrotechnics do not let up from hereon in. Sometimes it feels as if we are at an unnervingly bloody rock concert, other times a grungy death metal club. Visually it is epic and elemental, with the flames at the back and earth at the front, along with the sound of water off stage. There are thunderous strains of music by the collective BL!NDMAN complete with distorted vocals rising in moments of violence, and an almost constant throb of percussion, including a blacksmith’s wheel played with a knife. A smell of burning rises off Jan Versweyveld’s stunning set. Lights flash, smoke machines work from above and below, and a chorus of dancers thrash their limbs and stick out their tongues, half-human, half-animal (choreography by Wim Vandekeybus). The dead are wrapped in shrouds and lifted off the stage like parcelled meat or images from a Francis Bacon canvas, with buckets of blood poured from the rafters. What stops it from feeling queasily glamorised in its violence is the depth of emotion. There is a specific focus on women’s tragedy within war. Men such as Agamemnon blame their violence on bigger forces: “We are slaves to the masses,” he says, speaking of the power of the people, of the oracle revealing Iphigenia’s sacrifice and of the gods, all the while absolving himself of blame. Some of the violence is sexualised, from the cutting of a penis to a sword piercing a vagina, but this savagery, more than ever now, feels like an appalling fact of war. Women and children are shown to suffer, abjectly and graphically. Daughters who are sacrificed look impossibly young and innocent. Even more powerful is the mourning of mothers on both sides of the Greek and Trojan divide. The grief of Janni Goslinga’s Hecuba is immense as her daughter Cassandra (Maria Kraakman) is made Agamemnon’s concubine, while Polyxena and Polydoros (both Ilke Paddenburg) are killed. We see Hecuba crying protractedly over their disfigured bodies. We see her anger, too, that burns as hot as the flames on stage. Clytemnestra and Helena are both played by Nietvelt in a sensational double performance, while Goslinga is every bit as riveting. The show makes immense demands on its performers who deliver with unfaltering energy. If these ancient stories look simplified and cinematic here, their emotional and psychological complexities remain: we hear of Agamemnon’s uncertainty over sacrificing Iphigenia and the chilling psychology of martyrdom as she gives herself over. Later Clytemnestra’s intentions behind murdering Agamemnon are unpicked by her daughter, Elektra (Hélène Devos), and she and Orestes (Minne Koole) emerge as self-appointed, self-righteous moral agents, petulant in their tone, just as vengeful as their forefathers and deranged with bloodlust. Where order is traditionally restored in the final story of Orestes with the appearance of Apollo, here the god looks almost cartoonish and his invocation to let grudges go seems deliberately pat. We end with a doom-laden song, more crashing metal sounds, and it is clear in Van Hove’s ancient Greece that the cycles of war, violence and revenge simply go on and on.  Age of Rage is at the Barbican, London, until 8 May.",Arts/Stage,Age of Rage review – ancient Greek tragedy explodes into our times,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/06/age-of-rage-review-barbican-london
