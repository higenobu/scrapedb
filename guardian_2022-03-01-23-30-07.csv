3/1/2022,"A Ukrainian campaigner challenged Boris Johnson over the UK’s failure to bring in swift sanctions against Russians resident in London, in an emotional intervention during a press conference in Poland. Daria Kaleniuk, the executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Centre, also pressed Johnson over the collective refusal of Nato countries to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine. Kaleniuk told Johnson, who was giving a press conference in Warsaw after talks with his Polish counterpart, that she was from Kyiv and had passed across the border into Poland in recent days. “Ukrainian women and Ukrainian children are in deep fear because of bombs and missiles which are going from the sky. Ukrainian people are desperately asking for the rights to protect our sky, we are asking for a no-fly zone,” she said. “What’s the alternative for the no-fly zone? Nato is not willing to defend because Nato is afraid of world war III but it’s already started and it’s Ukrainian children who are there taking the hit. “You are talking about more sanctions, prime minister, but Roman Abramovich is not sanctioned, he’s in London, his children are not in the bombardments, his children are there in London.” Johnson responded: “I just want to say I am acutely conscious there is not enough we can do as the UK government to help in the way that you want. I’ve got to be honest about that. When you talk about the no-fly zone … unfortunately the implication of that is that the UK would be engaged in shooting down Russian planes, would be engaged in direct combat in Russia. That’s not something we can do.” He said the UK had been among the first to “tighten the economic noose” around Putin’s regime, and “Putin and Putin alone” was responsible for the suffering of the Ukrainian people. Abramovich, the Russian billionaire who recently passed stewardship of Chelsea FC to a charitable foundation, is said to have gone to Belarus to try to help negotiate peace. Chris Bryant, a Labour MP, told parliament last Thursday that Abramovich should be sanctioned. Abramovich has vehemently disputed reports suggesting his alleged closeness to Vladimir Putin or that he has done anything to merit being sanctioned. Johnson is coming under mounting pressure over the UK’s slowness to bring in sanctions against oligarchs close to Putin, with the only asset freezes and travel bans so far brought in targeting Gennady Timchenko, Russia’s sixth richest oligarch, and Boris and Igor Rotenberg. Layla Moran, a Liberal Democrat MP, has listed in parliament 35 Russians who have been suggested by the imprisoned Russian dissident Alexei Navalny as possible targets for sanctions. Johnson on Tuesday acknowledged more could be done to tighten sanctions. “There is plainly more to be done on [the payments system] Swift, we can tighten up yet further on Swift, even though it has had a dramatic effect already, I think we do need to go further,” he said. “There’s more to be done on Sberbank, there’s more to be done on the freezing of Russian assets. I think there’s genuine amazement and dismay in Russia about what has happened already but there is more to be done.” There could be more “severing of sporting links” and “cracking down on the billionaires associated with Vladimir Putin,” he added.",News/Politics,Ukrainian activist berates Boris Johnson over Russia response,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/01/ukrainian-activist-berates-boris-johnson-over-russia-response

3/1/2022,"A bill to enshrine the right to abortion in federal law was blocked by Senate Republicans on Monday. Although Democrats expected the bill to fail, they brought the measure forward at a perilous moment for abortion rights, to ensure votes were recorded. The supreme court is expected in June to decide a Mississippi case which could severely curtail or gut abortion rights nationally. On Monday, Democrats were 14 votes shy of the 60 needed to bring the bill to the floor for debate. Joe Manchin, of West Virginia, was the only Democrat to join Republicans. “Abortion is a fundamental right and women’s decisions over women’s healthcare belong to women, not to extremist rightwing legislators,” the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, told reporters. “Every American deserves to know where their senator stands on an issue as important as the right to choose.” In 1973, the supreme court invalidated dozens of state abortion bans in its landmark Roe v Wade ruling, which found a constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy. Since then, Roe has protected women’s right to abort a pregnancy to the point a fetus can survive outside the womb, generally regarded as 22 to 24 weeks gestation. The bill brought before the Senate on Monday, the Women’s Health Protection Act (WHPA), would codify the rights provided by Roe in federal law. Last September, it was passed by the Democrat-controlled House. “Tonight we voted in the Senate to say that Roe v Wade is the law of the land,” said Patty Murray of Washington state, a lead sponsor of the bill, after it failed. “Democrats stood up and said women should make their own healthcare decisions. We trust women. We trust patients. We trust their doctors.” In oral arguments in the Mississippi case, justices showed an interest in undermining or overturning Roe. If the conservative majority were to reverse Roe, abortion would effectively become a state issue. In that scenario, 26 states are expected to ban abortion immediately or as quickly as possible. The 6-3 conservative court has already permitted severe restrictions in Texas, which it allowed to enact a ban at six weeks, before most women know they are pregnant. The WHPA would codify a right American women have had for generations and block medically unnecessary restrictions. That would undo hundreds of laws passed by right-leaning states that have sought to make abortion more expensive and difficult to obtain, often without any medical benefit to women. Steve Daines, a Montana Republican, called the WHPA “extreme”, adding: “It’s an egregious violation of the most fundamental of all human rights, and that is the right to life.” Young women, poor women and women of color disproportionately seek abortion. Abortion bans would fall heavily on such populations, forcing millions to travel hundreds of miles to seek abortion and leaving others with few options except clandestine providers or unwanted pregnancy.",News/World news,Republicans and Joe Manchin block Senate bill to secure abortion rights,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/republicans-joe-manchin-us-senate-block-bill-abortion-rights
3/1/2022,"Volodymyr Zelenskiy has appealed to the EU to “prove that you are with us” and help “light win over darkness” in a passionate address to the European parliament after Ukraine’s membership application. In the speech made by videolink from Kyiv, the Ukrainian president said his people, including those killed by missile strikes on Tuesday in the country’s second city, Kharkiv, were sacrificing their lives for European ideals in the fight against the invading Russian forces. “Nobody’s going to break us. We’re strong, we’re Ukrainians. We have a desire to see our children alive, I think it is a fair one”, Zelenskiy said. “We are fighting for survival. We are fighting to be equal members of Europe.” He went on: “We are exactly the same as you are. So do prove that you are with us. Do prove that you are indeed Europeans and then life will win over death and light will win over darkness. Glory be to Ukraine”. The appeal came as France’s finance Minister Bruno Le Maire declared that the EU was “waging an all-out economic and financial war on Russia”, describing the sanctions packages as proving “extremely effective”. He told France Info radio. “We will cause the collapse of the Russian economy.” The comments drew an angry response from Russia’s former president and prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, who is now the deputy chair of the security council of the Russian Federation. He tweeted: “Watch your tongue, gentlemen! And don*t forget that in human history, economic wars quite often turned into real ones.” On Tuesday, Ukraine’s envoy to the EU formally handed over a request for membership of the European Union to the French ambassador, whose country holds the rolling presidency. Addressing MEPs, and Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, presidents of the European Commission and council respectively, Zelenskiy said the EU was “going to be much stronger with us, that’s for sure. Without you, Ukraine is going to be lonesome”. The impassioned appeal received a cautiously positive welcome from the two leaders of the EU’s institutions as they took to the podium at the front of the parliament’s hemicycle. “The council (of EU governments) will have to seriously look at the symbolic, political and legitimate request that has been made and make the appropriate choice in a determined and clear-headed manner,” Michel said. Von der Leyen said there was a “long path ahead”. “We have to end this war,” she said. “And we should talk about the next steps. But I am sure: nobody in this hemicycle can doubt that a people that stands up so bravely for our European values belongs in our European family.” The path to membership will require the commission to give a positive assessment as to Ukraine’s potential candidature, a process that can take up to 18 months. There would then be a transitional period of indefinite length during which Ukraine would need to adopt the entirety of EU law. Slovenia and Poland have called on EU member states to take “quick and courageous decisions” to ensure that Ukraine can join the EU by 2030. But there is some scepticism in other capitals about the wisdom of further expansion. Zelenskiy told MEPs that he was speaking to them between Russian bombardments. “You know, I don’t read off the paper, off the sheet,” he said. “Because the time of paper in the life of my country has ended.” Today would be the last for some of those fighting for Ukraine’s freedom, he added. “We are giving away our best people, the strongest ones, the most value based ones”. “This morning was a very tragic one for us: two cruise missiles hit Kharkiv, the city, which is located on the borders of the Russian Federation”, he said. “Can you imagine two cruise missiles hit Freedom Square? Dozens were killed. This is the price of freedom.” In Geneva, numerous diplomats walked out of the room when Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, addressed the UN human rights council via a pre-recorded video message, after a similar boycott of his speech at the nearby Conference on Disarmament. Diplomats gathered outside the Conference on Disarmament hall in front of a Ukrainian flag and applauded loudly. The applause could be heard in the chamber where Lavrov’s speech continued, with only a handful of ambassadors from countries including Yemen, Syria, Venezuela and Tunisia there to hear it.",News/World news,Ukraine president’s plea to EU: prove that you are with us,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/ukraine-president-volodymyr-zelenskiy-plea-to-eu-prove-that-you-are-with-us
3/1/2022,"Protected pipistrelle bats have been captured and fed on by a noble false widow spider, the first time the behaviour has been seen. The arachnids are thought to have been accidentally introduced to the UK from the Canary Islands about 100 years ago and have been spreading ever since. While most spiders feed on small insects, bats are at risk from the false widow because they have a potent venom which allows them to catch vertebrates much larger than the spider itself. Experts have said this spider could become one of the world’s most invasive. Scientists from the National University of Ireland Galway, who have been studying the spider, have published the extraordinary images of the spider feeding on pipistrelle bats in Shropshire, England. The study, published in the journal Ecosphere, warns that this spider is continuing to threaten native species. This is the first time a member of the false widow family of spiders has been recorded preying on a bat anywhere in the world. A noble false widow has, however, been seen preying on a lizard in Ireland. Wildlife artist Ben Waddams alerted scientists after bats living in his north Shropshire attic were found entangled in the spider web on two consecutive days. One, a young pup, was found dead after the spider completely immobilised it, pinning its limbs tightly to the torso with silk. Its body was shrivelled and discoloured from the spider feeding off the remains. A second adult bat was found entangled but alive, and was released safe and well. Dr John Dunbar, Irish Research Council Post-Doctoral fellow, Venom Systems Lab, Ryan Institute, NUI Galway and lead author of the study, said: “In more exotic parts of the world, scientists have been documenting such predation events by spiders on small vertebrates for many years, but we are only beginning to realise just how common these events occur. Now that this alien species has become well established in Ireland and the UK, we are witnessing such fascinating events on our very own doorstep. “Even other, much smaller, species of false widows are known to capture and feed on snakes and lizards. This study presents yet another example of the invasive impact by the noble false widow spider on native species. We know they are much more competitive than native spiders, and this further confirms their impact on prey species.” As well as being a potential danger to native wildlife, the false widow is known for its bite, and has caused mild to severe symptoms in those humans it has bitten. Pipistrelle bats, which are protected in the UK, declined sharply in the 20th century, with numbers falling 70% between 1978 and 1993, but have recently seen a small recovery thanks to conservation efforts. The noble false widow spider was first reported in southern England in 1879 and has increased its range and population density in recent decades, spreading northwards towards Scotland and westward through Wales and Ireland. In that time the species has also spread globally from across Europe, east Asia, North America, and South America.",News/Environment,Noble false widow spider captures bat in UK attic,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/01/noble-false-widow-spider-captures-bat-in-uk-attic
3/1/2022,"Russian forces have bombarded the government headquarters in Ukraine’s second biggest city, a huge armoured column is rolling towards the capital, and details have emerged of an attack that killed scores of Ukrainian soldiers in the east. In Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-biggest city, at least 11 civilians died after Russian missile strikes on the government headquarters, according to Ukrainian officials. About 70 miles (112kms) north-west of Kharkiv, local officials in Okhtyrka said more than 70 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in a missile strike on a military base, though there were conflicting accounts of when the attack took place. In the north, a Russian convoy approaching Kyiv is estimated to have doubled in length – to 4o miles (64km) – since three days ago. The front of the convoy is about 17 miles (25km) from the centre of the Ukrainian capital. US intelligence has warned Russia is attempting to encircle Kyiv. Satellite photos also showed deployments of ground forces and ground attack helicopter units in southern Belarus. In the south the key port city of Mariupol was without electricity following multiple missile attacks from advancing Russian forces, while reports said the southern city of Kherson was surrounded. On Thursday Russia attacked Ukraine along multiple axes, bringing to a calamitous end weeks of fruitless diplomatic efforts by western leaders to avert war. Fighting and other military activity took place around and on the way to Kyiv, including an ambitious attack by helicopters on the Hostomel military airbase. Ukraine lost control of the Chernobyl nuclear site in the north, where fighting raged after Russian troops crossed the border from Belarus. A substantial attack was also aimed towards the eastern city of Kharkiv. Russian forces also headed north and east from Crimea. Social media footage showed them reaching Kherson on the Dnieper, 80 miles inside Ukraine. On Friday Russian forces reached the outskirts of Kyiv, and carried out an amphibious assault from the Sea of Azov near Mariupol. The shape of the Russian incursion became clearer. On Saturday Russian forces in control of territory to the north-west of Kyiv continued their assault on the capital. Moscow claimed its forces had taken control of the Hostomel airfield. Elsewhere, heavy fighting was reported in and around Kharkiv and there were Ukrainian counterattacks in some places previously claimed by Russian forces, including Sumy in the east. On Sunday an attempted incursion in to Kharkiv was defeated. On Monday Russian rocket attacks killed dozens of people Kharkiv. Pre-dawn blasts were heard again in Kyiv and in Mariupol, which was surrounded by Russian forces and under heavy attack. Over the past few months Russia has forward-deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and even short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric also grew more belligerent. Vladimir Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of its two proxy states in east Ukraine. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. On 22 February a Reuters witness saw columns of military vehicles including tanks and armoured personnel carriers on the outskirts of Donetsk, the capital of one of the territories claimed by Russia. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Moscow’s army, consisting of around 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in both Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas of Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment has since grown. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year: Satellite photographs also show increased deployments in Novoozernoye in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in air and at sea, although the Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. Since then low-level fighting has continued along the front, and both sides have accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands is a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy giant Gazprom has been built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Europe’s most divisive energy project, Nord Stream 2 bypasses the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It has faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increases Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denies Ukraine transit fees and makes it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/russias-war-in-ukraine-complete-guide-in-maps-video-and-pictures
3/1/2022,"I love paneer but only ever use it in curries. What else should I do with it?Claire, Sheffield One of the advantages of paneer, whether it’s homemade or shop-bought, is that it doesn’t melt, so you get that satisfying, almost meaty texture. Meera Sodha, in Fresh India, uses the cheese to stuff romano peppers, but it is her skewers that are “one of the finest ways to eat paneer”. She starts by heating rapeseed oil in a small pan, then adds chickpea flour, cooking until “nutty brown”. She puts this in a bowl and combines with cubed paneer, grated ginger, crushed garlic, chilli powder, mango chutney, turmeric, tomato puree, chopped coriander, seasons, and marinates. The paneer is then threaded onto skewers with red pepper chunks and grilled on each side. Chef Maunika Gowardhan, author of Thali, is simpatico with you, Claire; her love affair with the stuff began when she started making her own (with added spinach and herbs) in her 20s. If you do likewise, then there’s a very simple solution: “Chop the paneer into small pieces, sprinkle with coarsely crushed cumin, a pinch of chaat masala, and top with pickled onions.” Alternatively, adds Romy Gill, whose latest book, On the Himalayan trail, is released in April, go sweet. She crushes cardamom and fennel seeds, adds these to crumbled (homemade) paneer then parcels the mix up in filo pastry. “A minute before you take them out of the oven, layer honey and crushed cardamom on top - or dried fruit, if you want.” Meanwhile, Dom Fernando, founder of contemporary Sri-Lankan restaurant Paradise in London, suggests searing it. He does this for a few minutes on each side before “applying a glaze of chervil, coriander, green chillies and ghee on top”. And, let’s face it, paneer is bland, so this hit of flavour is important. “It soaks up anything you add to it,” says Gowardhan, who suggests swapping out scrambled eggs for paneer in a spice-laden bhurji. “Add cumin, ginger and turmeric to a frying pan [with vegetable oil], maybe some red or green chilli peppers, and fry.” Coarsely grate in your paneer and once cooked, add fresh coriander, and eat with flatbread. Alternatively, your flatbread could be stuffed. Gowardhan’s favoured filling is a mix of grated paneer, ginger, cumin, garam masala, fresh coriander, green chillies, and green peas – “make it slightly mushy”. She adds “about a tablespoon” to rolled-out paratha dough, then pulls the edges together to seal, and flattens. Once cooked in a drizzle of ghee (“ghee is life”), serve with pickle or raita for something “perfect, perfect, perfect”. That same stuffing is also prime for samosas. “You could make a mint chutney and mix that with the paneer,” adds Gowardhan. Encase all this in filo pastry and deep-fry for crispy, golden delights. “Claire could also make paneer koftas,” says Gill, who mixes the grated cheese with vegetables, spices (cumin, ground coriander), chillies and cornflour, then rolls into balls. “I grate in carrots, onions, courgettes (when in season), or squash – just make sure you squeeze out all the water.” Or channel Gill’s mum with paneer pakoras: add the cheese, grated potatoes, onions and “any vegetables you have” to the batter. After all, adds Gill, “she was the queen of variation”. Got a culinary dilemma?

3/1/2022,"Afew months after graduating, mid-recession, on to the dole and shortly before I started writing for the Guardian, I worked very briefly for an online magazine as an editorial assistant. It was on my first day there that my older, female boss taught me a lesson I have never forgotten. After running through my various duties, she added this advice: “The men upstairs,” she said, “are going to think you are their secretary. They are going to ask you to do their photocopying and answer their phones. And it is very important that when they do, you say the following phrase: ‘No. That’s not my job.’” Then she made me repeat it several times, until I said it with confidence. It’s a simple refusal, and an effective one, but the first time I said it I was nervous. On repetition, however, it became second nature, and being able to say “no” without apology or excuse has stood me in good stead ever since. I am what many would consider an assertive person, but like many women I still sometimes have to force myself to stand up for what I want. I’ve been thinking about this because Anne Dickson’s A Woman in Your Own Right, the classic assertiveness bible first published in 1982, is being rereleased next month. My mother first gave me a copy when I was a teenager and, having worked with women’s groups in the 1980s, schooled me in assertiveness and self-defence at a time when “girlboss” culture was barely a glint in Margaret Thatcher’s eye. Girlboss culture is the latest incarnation of the assertiveness and empowerment guides of the 1980s. A girlboss, for those who don’t know, is a 21st-century working woman “whose success is defined in opposition to the masculine business world in which she swims upstream” (this, according to the businesswoman and #Girlboss author Sophia Amoruso). The girlboss is essentially a power-suited working girl for the Instagram era, a pinkwashed hypercapitalist career queen who “leans in”. She is reportedly on her way out, and not before time. Her place in fourth wave feminism has been mired by controversy: on the one hand, she has been accused of rebranding personal power and success as a quest for equality while doing nothing to challenge structural inequalities; on the other, she has at times served as a powerful archetype for women of colour such as the entrepreneur Otegha Uwagba, in terms of achieving success in areas dominated by white men. All of which begs the question, do we really need assertiveness training these days, when everywhere you look women are loudly professing how empowered and confident they are? If we are smashing glass ceilings, are we really likely to cave in to pressure from our family to not order the jalfrezi for fear it will be too spicy, as one scenario in A Woman in Your Own Right plays out? Dickson argues that awareness and action are not the same thing. “It is easier to recognise inequality, to be aware of it, than it is to know how to change our behaviour,” she tells me. “We simply don’t know how to alter our speech or approach, so again the skills in this book are essential for personal change.” She also notes that, despite huge advances, sexism hasn’t gone away, “just underground”, and that women are still struggling to assert themselves equally because “we have many inner attitudes to overcome” including “a dependence on outside approval, uncertainty about how to express a difference of opinion or to ask someone to change their behaviour”. This focus on women’s behaviour has made assertiveness training a precursor to what Rosalind Gill and Shani Orgad call “confidence culture”. Confidence culture, as Gill and Orgad explain in their new book of the same title, posits that “women suffer from an internal ‘defect’, namely a ‘confidence gap’, which holds them back in the world of work”. A woman’s job, indeed her labour, is to remedy that, often at the expense of challenging the unequal sexist and racist structures that obstruct women’s careers. Books such as Sheryl Sandberg’s Lean In exemplify this “cult”, which encourages women to internalise the problem of inequality as individualised. In other words, you work on changing yourself within the existing capitalist, corporate reality, rather than trying to transform that reality. Suddenly, well-meaning slogans about a woman’s need to “stop apologising” or “never ask permission” don’t seem so empowering. None of this is to say that we should never work on ourselves. I have found the power of no very useful in my career. Nevertheless, the feminist imperative of the 1980s towards assertiveness has in the intervening decades morphed into a culture that prizes confidence as meme, as marketing tactic, and as a distraction from fighting for real political change. A Woman in Her Own Right and similar philosophies focused on language and behaviour as a way of helping women feel better equipped to survive in sexist environments. Today’s confidence culture expects a woman to remake her whole self. Far from being liberating, it all seems like a lot of, well, work. Which is why I suspect that you might be better off with A Woman in Your Own Right than any of the modern girlboss manuals that claim to be able to transform you wholesale into a kickass corporate woman. Despite claims that the pandemic has led to the decline of the girlboss, in fact what we are seeing is the opposite: confidence culture and its mantras only seem to be strengthening. Gill and Orgad noted, as a depressing example, an article in the Boston Globe which encourages women to not feel guilt at dropping out of the workforce because of the pandemic – rather than confronting the structural reasons they’ve been forced to. How much more are we expected to work on ourselves? Perhaps it’s time to turn to these girlbosses and tell them: “No. That’s not my job.” Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist",Opinion/Opinion,"The decline of the girlboss?

3/1/2022,"Last autumn, I visited Sissinghurst Castle Garden. November is not traditionally the best time for a pilgrimage to a world-famous garden, but the weather had been mild, so it had held on to the remnants of its summer glories. In the veg gardens, still busy with fennel and chard, I read a little chalkboard scribbled with a note about “companion planting”. The gardeners had planted French marigold near the carrots to deter carrot fly, and poached egg plant to attract hoverflies, the larvae of which have an appetite for aphids. I realised that in my own garden, established but new to me, I had made a mistake. Overexcited by the prospect of growing veg to eat, I neglected to think much about flowers. “Flowers are really important because they’re a key part of a plant’s life cycle,” says Poppy Okotcha, an ecological grower, forager and home cook, who has a devoted following on Instagram and is cultivating her own edible and medicinal forest garden in Devon. “Understanding those full life cycles, and how they play in with other creatures, whether insects or animals, including ourselves, is really important.” Asking gardeners about their favourite flowers seems almost heretical nowadays, when the soil has been recognised as such a vital resource for wellbeing and productivity. It seems frivolous to focus on growing peonies. But flowers still have a vital role to play in modern gardens. “I think that the beauty of them is useful, and the fact that their beauty is really useful to us is an incredible thing,” says Okotcha. “It’s so good for our mental wellbeing. There is nothing much more enjoyable than sitting in a garden full of flowers. They’re so sensory, it is just such a wonderful experience to interact with them.” Okotcha admits that she has a soft spot for calendula. “The flowers are amazing for pollinators. They are medicinal, they can be used as balms, they can be made into teas, and they are a great companion plant. They’re annuals, which means that you just sow the seeds in the spring and you’ll have lovely flowers by summertime.” Artists have been drawn to the beauty of flowers for millennia; ancient Egyptian art depicts the decorative use of flowers in vases and flower bowls in homes. Most of us are familiar with the mood-enhancing properties of a fresh bunch of flowers brightening up a room, and it’s possible to grow or buy them ethically. The SSAW Collective is a UK community of chefs, florists and growers who share a focus on nature-led practices, seasonality, and advocating for progressive changes in the food and floral industries. They sell cut flowers from their own fields, from April through to October. They had cyclamen on offer for Valentine’s Day – as well as a cheeky poster of a bunch of snowdrops asking the question, “Why buy roses in February?” I spoke to two of its three founders, the florists and flower growers Olivia Wilson and Jess Geissendorfer (the third, Lulu Cox, is a chef with an interest in regenerative farming). Wilson and Geissendorfer are passionate about sustainability in the cut-flower industry, which has not received anywhere near the level of scrutiny as fashion or food. “Essentially, over the last 50 years, with the development of a global flower culture industry, we’ve completely lost touch with what seasonality truly means. That is not necessarily the fault of florists, it’s just that people now can get roses all year round. This has created a nightmare situation where flowers are being grown in incredibly unnatural and harmful ways, and there’s not really any need for it,” says Wilson. She says one key problems is a lack of labelling: “Customers, and even florists, aren’t able to find out the information about where and how their flowers are grown.” One small step, suggests Geissendorfer, would be for consumers to reframe their expectations of cut flowers. “People want them to last a certain amount of time, and it just isn’t realistic for a natural product. A lot of people just plonk flowers in a vase and expect them to be okay and to last a really long time.” I have to ask. What are their favourites? “I like all flowers,” says Wilson, diplomatically, “but I do have a soft spot for the ones that could go unnoticed, that are just there, doing their own thing, not asking too much. Something like a geum.” Geissendorfer says she couldn’t name one favourite, but will admit that she likes poppies. “They’re quite a bitchy flower, because they don’t like being touched, but they look just as good in a field, or on a mound of weeds, as they do at the centre of a bridal bouquet.” Both point out that there are plenty of varieties of cut-and-come-again flowers that people can grow in their own gardens, if they have available space. “You’ll have corridors for pollinators, and if you’re not using pesticides in your garden that can have such a huge, huge impact,” says Geissendorfer. “People don’t realise how much positive effect you could have on the environment, in your own garden.” Poached egg plant Loved by children for its resemblance to a poached egg, as well as by predatory insects such as hoverflies, which should help out with any aphid problems in your garden. Nasturtium This annual is one for the kitchen gardeners, as its flowers, seeds and leaves are all edible. “They’re genuinely delicious. The flowers are so peppery, and the leaves are really lovely to eat as well,” says Jess Geissendorfer. Look at Poppy Okotcha’s Instagram for a great post on pickled nasturtium seeds. Cosmos Cosmos come in many shapes and sizes, and often resemble fireworks. Pollinators love the colourful flowers, which can be cut and brought inside. A tip from the SSAW Collective is to dip them in hot water for 15 seconds, then in cold water, which should help them last longer in a vase. Coneflowers Rudbeckia, also known as black-eyed Susans, flower from late summer to mid-autumn, keeping vibrant colour in the garden way past the summer boom. In winter, the seedheads remain an attractive feature, and provide food and shelter for wildlife. Snowdrops Okotcha says bulbs are a good place for novices to start: “They’re pretty foolproof, you put them in the ground and they just get on with it.” In spring, she takes notes of the flowers she spots growing and then orders bulbs in the autumn. “One of my favourites are snowdrops. They’re bloom early in the year, and it’s a lovely, welcome sign of spring.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Flower power: why blooms are an essential part of any garden,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/01/flower-power-why-blooms-are-an-essential-part-of-any-garden
3/1/2022,"In 2019, reviewing a re-release of Eyes Wide Shut, Peter Bradshaw pointed out that in the age of Epstein, the idea of a secret society of the rich and powerful exploiting the vulnerable no longer seemed far-fetched. Now comes The Scary of Sixty-First, a kind of cinematic love letter to Stanley Kubrick set in the New York of Eyes Wide Shut, about Jeffrey Epstein and the conspiracy theories around his death. It’s a shallow, outrage-baiting movie out to shock but not much else. Disappointingly, the director and co-writer is supersmart switched-on Dasha Nekrasova, an actor who plays Kendall’s press adviser Comfrey in Succession and co-hosts the Red Scare podcast. The movie begins like an episode of Girls: friends Noelle (co-writer Madeline Quinn) and Addie (Betsey Brown) move into a suspiciously cheap rented apartment in Manhattan’s swanky Upper East Side. Eli Keszler’s pounding synth-y score signals something is up; so too does the creepy second bedroom, which has a mirror on the ceiling and doors that lock from the outside. Then comes a knock at the door. A woman credited only as The Girl (played by Nekrasova, possessing Chloë Sevigny levels of aloof cool), tells them that the apartment was previously owned by Epstein. Noelle is soon hooked on The Girl and her theories, becoming convinced the Queen is behind Epstein’s death: “The royals will do anything to protect themselves.” Meanwhile, Addie seems to be possessed by one of Epstein’s victims: sucking her thumb and dirty-talking to her boyfriend during sex: “Fuck me like I’m 13.” The movie goes into full schlock giallo mode with a red-lit scene, Addie masturbating while rubbing Prince Andrew wedding memorabilia into her pants. The point of the film, I think, is to watch it with a clever, detached, critical cool-girl irony. And no doubt I’m walking into a trap finding it troublingly unbothered about Epstein’s actual victims. Still, to me this feels like a silly smirking film with zero insights into abuse or conspiracy theories.

3/1/2022,"The value of the publisher of the Daily Mirror and Daily Express newspapers plunged by a quarter on Tuesday after it warned that inflationary pressure and soaring newsprint costs would hit profits this year. The London-listed publisher, which also owns 200 regional print and digital titles, including the Manchester Evening News and Liverpool Echo, warned that it expects to see a “modest” drop in operating profits this year. “This is not a profits warning,” said Jim Mullen, the chief executive of Reach. “This is a moderation in profits due to inflation.” Shares fell 25% to 169p after the guidance was announced, wiping about £180m from the company’s market value. The company said that the existing issue of rising newsprint costs, due to growing distribution costs and supply issues, is now being affected by a “significant” increase in energy prices. Newsprint costs rose from £45.8m to £52.9m last year. “The impact from inflation, which began to affect the business towards the end of 2021, has now intensified, particularly in print production,” the company said. “This has primarily been reflected in the cost of newsprint … which is being heavily impacted by rising energy costs. We expect this to continue in 2022.” The forecast of reduced profits this year, after a healthy rise to £143.5m last year from £131.3m in 2020, means the company is not able to completely offset the rising costs with savings plans. Mullen would not comment on whether the company may need to look at rising the price of its papers or job cuts this year as a result. Reached hired 400 new editorial staff last year taking its total employee base to 5,200, with more than 50% in journalist roles. Labour costs rose from £217m to £232m last year, although the company will realise significant savings from a move to permanently close 30 offices last year to allow staff to work from home permanently, which it said reflected the wider change in post-pandemic office culture. Mullen pointed to the growing success of its digital operation, which grew by a quarter last year to £148.3m and more than offset the decline in print income, pushing total revenues up 2.6% to £615.8m in the first like-for-like growth since 2007. “We expect [the situation] to moderate regarding the inflationary pressures we have had,” he said. “Three years ago this would have been fairly significant. But we are seeing digital growth more than cover the decline in print.” Reach’s print business, which Mullen said has “at least” 20 years of significant cash generation in it, saw income from advertising and circulation revenues drop by 4.7% to £454.5m. While still the dominant income stream, accounting for 74% of total revenues, Mullen said the company is on track for digital income to hit £238m by 2024 – double the 2020 level. Mullen, the former boss of Ladbrokes Coral, joined Reach in 2019 when its share price was 89p. The company, which hit a year-low on Tuesday as investors reacted to the profit forecast, closed at 227p on Monday. Analysts at Peel Hunt forecast that Reach’s profits for this year will dip to £134.3m. “We feel the downside from here is now limited,” said analyst Malcolm Morgan.",News/Business,Value of Mirror publisher Reach plunges 25% after it warns of profit squeeze,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/01/value-of-daily-mirror-and-daily-express-publisher-reach-plunges-25-per-cent-after-it-warns-of-profit-squeeze
3/1/2022,"Donald Trump told William Barr, his attorney general, that the secret to a “good tweet” was “just the right amount of crazy”. The detail from Barr’s forthcoming memoir leaked out on Monday, via Josh Dawsey of the Washington Post. The Post, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal have reported on the contents of One Damn Thing After Another: Memoirs of an Attorney General, which will be published on 8 March. Barr’s title is taken from a description of the job by Ed Levi, appointed by Gerald Ford after the Watergate scandal. Some critics responded to the news that Barr says Trump is unqualified to be president and defends his own handling of the Russia investigation by wondering if the world really needs one book after another by former Trump aides bent on self-justification. Barr, for example, describes a tumultuous Oval Office meeting on 1 December 2020, at which he refused to back Trump’s lie about electoral fraud in his defeat by Joe Biden. On the page, the former attorney general says he tried to resign. But the resignation offer is not described in books by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa (Peril) and Jonathan Karl (Betrayal) which otherwise closely mirror Barr’s description of the meeting. Barr did quit nearly two weeks later, on 14 December. Maggie Haberman of the New York Times, a reporter who had a direct line to Trump during his time in power, has her own Trump book coming out in October. She said the revelations so far from Barr showed showed that “the cabinet member/person of stature most loved by Maga has become the latest person in a long string who worked for Trump to say he’s unfit”. Dawsey tweeted the tidbit about Trump’s tweets, tweeting: “One bit from Barr book: Trump told his former attorney general the ‘secret of a really good tweet’ was ‘just the right amount of crazy’.” Trump used Twitter as his primary means of communication but he has been suspended from it since the deadly Capitol riot, which happened after he told supporters to “fight like hell” in service of his lie about voter fraud in his election defeat by Biden. The Post reported that Barr and White House lawyers developed a system for dealing with Trump’s more extreme – or “legally problematic” – ideas, such as using an executive order to end citizenship for people born in the US to undocumented parents. The lawyers, Barr writes, “operated like a tag team, so that neither of us would provoke too much of the president’s ire at one time”. “We referred to this as choosing who would ‘eat the grenade’,” Barr says.",Arts/Books, Barr book reveals Trump’s secret to a ‘good tweet’: ‘just the right amount of crazy’,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/01/william-barr-memoir-donald-trump-tweets
3/1/2022,"Colorado is slated to become the first US state to accept tax payments in cryptocurrency, a move the governor’s office has described as the “next logical step on the path to digital statehood”. Colorado’s governor, Jared Polis, who announced the effort last week, explained in a tweet that the state would accept crypto payments converted into a dollar value, which would then be deposited in the state’s treasury. In a recent interview with CNBC, Polis said the payments will be processed by an intermediary and that program is expected to start by the summer. Polis said he hopes to expand the program to include other state business such as driver’s licenses and hunting licenses. Polis, a former tech entrepreneur, has spoken at crypto conferences, talked to Wired about his ambitions to make Colorado a pioneering state for crypto and even proposed moving the state’s cattle brand system onto the blockchain. In a statement to the Guardian, Polis’ press secretary, Conor Cahill, called the tax effort the state’s “next logical step on the path to digital statehood”. “Governor Polis is proud to lead efforts to create a strong and dynamic crypto ecosystem that puts Colorado at the forefront of digital innovation,” Cahill added, pointing out that the state was the very first to employ a “chief blockchain architect” – one of the numerous parties the governor’s office will be working with to process cryptocurrency for taxes. There might be some concerns, however. According to CNBC, cryptocurrency is considered “property” by the federal government, which means its owners would have to pay taxes on cryptocurrency itself before it can be used as a method of payment. Cahill did not respond to a specific question about whether or not this might deter some from using cryptocurrency to pay their taxes. Polis’s announcement was met with mixed reviews on social media. “It’s also a fantastic way to contribute to the climate change threatening Colorado’s tourism industry! Great thinking!” one user wrote in response to Polis’ tweet. “I have yet to comprehend crypto. But about homemade chocolate chip cookies? Will Colorado accept that?” wrote another. Colorado’s move follows efforts in other states to bring crypto into the mainstream. Wyoming is looking into making sales tax payable through cryptocurrency while Arizona aims to accept bitcoin as legal tender. New York City’s mayor, Eric Adams, received his first paycheck in cryptocurrency after starting office in January, keeping with a promise he’d made that he would accept his first three paychecks in bitcoin in a bid to make New York the “global capital for cryptocurrency”.",News/US news,Colorado to become first US state to accept cryptocurrency tax payments ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/01/colorado-tax-payments-cryptocurrency
