2/2/2022,"Health workers on the frontline of India’s Covid vaccination programme say people are being officially registered as double vaccinated without receiving both doses because of pressure to meet government targets. Workers described how easy it was to falsely register second vaccine doses for people who did not attend appointments, by using personal records from their first dose and opting to bypass a code sent to their mobile phone.  “There is no technical glitch,” said Aditya, a health worker from Uttar Pradesh who requested that only his first name was used owing to fear of reprisal. “The issue is the unprecedented pressure on us to increase the number of vaccinated people.” The vaccine status of all citizens is recorded on a government-built platform called CoWIN. CoWIN vaccination certificates are globally recognised and make people eligible for inter-state and international travel, including to countries that are accepting only fully vaccinated passengers. The government had set a deadline of the end of 2021 to get everyone in India vaccinated, which was missed. According to official statistics, 75% of the adult population have now had two doses. Last week, the prime minister, Narendra Modi, tweeted that he was “proud of all those who are making our vaccination drive a success”. However, health workers who spoke to the Guardian alleged the figures were being manipulated, and estimated that in urban areas 20% to 35% of people had been fraudulently registered as double vaccinated. In rural areas they estimated that the figure could be as high as 40% to 60%. Manish Kumar, a 21-year-old student from Patna, Bihar, described how he had been on the way to a vaccination centre in June last year when his sister, Puja Kumari, 28, received a text message on her phone saying she had successfully received her first vaccine. When the siblings reached the centre about an hour later they raised the problem with officials and threatened legal action. “After that, they vaccinated all of us, including my sister, saying there was a technical glitch and apologised,” said Kumar. But the same then happened to Kumar’s father, Mukesh Prasad, a farmer, who was en route to the vaccination centre when he got a text saying his second vaccine had been administered. Another problem emerged when it came to Kumar’s second dose. In October, after he had moved 170 miles away to attend Banaras Hindu University in the neighbouring state of Uttar Pradesh, he received a message saying he had just received his second dose at a health facility in Patna. “I want some sort of protection from Covid-19, but how will my father and I get the second vaccine done?” asked Kumar. Kaprela Hari, a 32-year-old IT professional from Rajampet in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, faced a similar problem for his father, a farmer, who had been too busy in the fields to make time for his second appointment. Out of the blue, he received a text message confirming his father’s receipt of a second vaccine dose and a link to the CoWIN certificate of double vaccination status. “The nearby facility for vaccination would open at 11am and close at 1pm, and it had not been possible for me to get my father vaccinated in this two-hour gap,” said Hari. “So I was surprised when I got the vaccination message.” After taking up the issue with a health worker posted in his locality, Hari said he was told that the local facility was not responsible and that his father “should have turned up for vaccination on time”. Hari concluded that data was being “manipulated”. Deceased people also appear to be receiving vaccine certificates in an apparent attempt to boost numbers. In January, Uday Bir Singh was having lunch with relatives in a restaurant when he received a text: “Dear Manju Rani, you have successfully been vaccinated with your second dose.” A click on the link attached to the message revealed the vaccine certificate of his wife, Rani, who had died of Covid eight months earlier. “It felt like a cruel joke,” said Akanksha, Singh’s daughter. “How can my mother be vaccinated in January 2022 when she died in May 2021? We felt devastated and didn’t understand how it happened.” In a statement, the government denied any vaccine fraud was taking place, stating that every vaccine team had a “verifier” whose sole job it was to confirm the identities of those being vaccinated. “[The] CoWIN system is an inclusive platform and has been designed keeping the limitations and challenges of mobile and internet availability across the country,” the government said. “Necessary features and flexibility, to ensure that every eligible individual has the access to vaccination, regardless of any of physical, digital or socioeconomic barriers to access, have been incorporated in CoWIN. “At the same time, SOPs [standard operating procedures] and features have been incorporated to prevent fraudulent and/or wrong data entry at time of vaccination.” India’s healthcare system is woefully underfunded and underresourced, and the vaccination programme has put more pressure on frontline healthcare workers, who work long hours on little pay. Several workers said the practice of falsely registering people as fully vaccinated was a result of threats from senior officials to suspend workers or withhold salaries if vaccination targets were not met. “I was slapped in a meeting by a district level official who was not happy with the number of vaccinations we have been doing,” said a 45-year-old health worker in Bihar. “Later, the official called me and apologised, saying that there is tremendous pressure from the minister of the state.” Wahida, a healthcare worker from Jammu and Kashmir, said: “The easy way to get away with the situation is to register people, no matter what. It is less hectic and officials are also happy.”",News/World news,Indian health workers allege widespread vaccine certificate fraud,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/02/indian-health-workers-allege-widespread-vaccine-certificate
2/2/2022,"Locals say they are living off perished goods in the central Australia town of Ampilatwatja as flooding, road closures and Covid cases combine to cause a “perfect storm” of crises. A week of heavy rain in the town, which is around 350km north-east of Alice Springs, has caused road closures and a food and supplies shortage. A Covid outbreak is also believed to be growing.  Residents told Guardian Australia they had not been able to manage the outbreak due to a lack of rapid antigen tests, and because staff at the local health clinics had been stretched. Steven and Narelle Walker, managers at the Aherrenge community shop, said locals were frustrated at the lack of support from authorities. “We can’t get fresh fruit or veggies due to the roads being flooded, and our suppliers can’t supply us because the trucks can’t get through. We’re been living off perished goods now,” Steven said. “There are small pockets of frustration now, and some fear. There are a lot of people scared of catching the virus.” Narelle said: “We can’t even test ourselves. Because there are no RATs. We can’t protect ourselves nor our staff. Nobody has had enough, they bring these rules in and no one is prepared.” The town has reported 11 cases, with locals suspecting there are more going unreported. Steven said the community in Ampilatwatja felt “abandoned” by authorities, adding that they had missed out on two weekly trucks carrying vital supplies in the time the roads had been closed. “A lot of people are confused by the rules as well, are in lockdown or lock in? Some people don’t know and are confused by changing definitions and rules. “We’ve been promised more supplies and more RAT tests, but nothing has happened, and nothing seems to eventuate. We’re just working through the stocks that we’ve built up, but we feel like we’re abandoned.” Steven said communication had also been difficult, with phone and internet coverage dropping out. Telstra’s NT regional general manager, Nic Danks, told the Guardian the “hardware issue” has been causing the disruptions, and that the flood waters had prevented them from making any repairs. “We have tried multiple routes and ways to get to the affected site but flood waters and bad weather are preventing us from accessing the area. “We tried to chopper technicians to the site today but bad weather in the area forced us to turn back. We are working closely with local and state authorities as well as the community to get the area back online as quickly as possible.” A spokesperson for Northern Territory Health said: “Our transport team work with our providers to ensure the deployment of aircraft suitable for the conditions in each community.” “Our transport operators are prepared for wet roads and airstrips. They have a firm understanding of the conditions on the ground in these locations and the capacity of their community stores, where they have ensured increased stock is on-hand to see the community through an extended period of isolation.” But John Paterson, from the Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance Northern Territory (AMSANT), called the situation a “perfect storm” of challenges, and said there were “huge delays” in getting supplies into Ampilatwatja. “All this has just come at once to remote communities where we have some of the sickest and most chronically ill populations in the country,” he said. “We’ve been calling for assistance for multiple days now, and I totally understand the logistical problems, but there seems to be a reluctance from authorities to provide any help.” Paterson said he thought military support would be able to navigate the logistical difficulties, but has said there was “waning” interest in response to requests for help. “There just seems to be a lack of wanting of willingness when it comes to our requests for support and assistance from all levels of government,” he said. “It just seems like nobody cares for our people any more.” He said locals were feeling “very anxious,” and that many of the frustrations came down to a lack of coordination by authorities. “It’s not up to the Aboriginal community control sector to take on that responsibility. This is government’s responsibility, and they ought to be stepping up and providing the appropriate leadership support and assistance to our remote communities when in need of help. “Elders, in particular, are absolutely fearful of the spread of Covid and the lack of access to essential services such as hospitals if they, as well as food security and the lack of food.” Paterson pointed to a lack of resources for local medical clinics, saying staff there were stretched under pre-pandemic demands, and had been completely overwhelmed by the pandemic. “The local Aboriginal health service is already under enormous strain in terms of workforce capacity, people have been at the forefront of this pandemic for the last two and a bit years. “Our current workforce that provides day to day primary health care to our mob are now expected to drop all of that responsibility and that service and then the take up Covid testing and vaccinations.” “They’re fatigued, they’re tired and they’re right on the edge of burnout.”",News/Australia news,Remote Northern Territory town hit by food shortages amid flood and Covid crises,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/02/remote-northern-territory-town-hit-by-food-shortages-amid-flood-and-covid-crises
2/2/2022,"The family of Kathie McCormack Durst, the first wife of the late disgraced real estate heir Robert Durst, have filed a wrongful death lawsuit against his second wife. New York officials charged Durst with the murder of his first wife last year, nearly 40 years after she disappeared under mysterious circumstances. But his death in a California prison, where he was serving a life sentence for the murder of his friend, brought the case to a halt.  In a lawsuit filed on Monday, the McCormack family alleges that Debrah Lee Charatan, Durst’s second wife who stands to collect millions from his estate, helped him avoid justice for years in connection with McCormack’s death and two other killings. Charatan is believed to be the sole or primary beneficiary of a trust worth tens of millions of dollars and is now the nominated executor of Durst’s estate, said Robert Abrams, a lawyer for the McCormack family. The lawyer alleges the money was promised to Charatan in exchange for her help and recently notified Durst’s trust that the McCormack family would be seeking more than $100m from Charatan and Durst’s estate. Filed in federal court on the 40th anniversary of McCormack’s disappearance, the lawsuit seeks damages in excess of $75,000. Robert Durst died on 10 January in a California hospital while serving a life sentence for shooting his best friend, Susan Berman, in the back of the head at her Los Angeles home in 2000 as she was preparing to tell police what she knew about McCormack’s death. Just weeks after he was sentenced for Berman’s killing, a New York grand jury indicted him on a second-degree murder charge in McCormack’s case. But the 78-year-old’s death upended both cases, bringing the McCormack charges to a halt and, thanks to a quirk in the California law, seeing the Berman murder conviction rendered void because the case was under appeal when Durst died. Durst was suspected in his first wife’s disappearance for years, and the Westchester county district attorney’s office has long faced criticism for waiting decades to file charges against him in the matter. A civil lawsuit against his estate was one of the only remaining legal avenues for McCormack’s family, according to Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor who was not involved in the case. “No one was willing to prosecute and try the case. Unfortunately, because of this long delay, Kathie Durst and her family will never receive the criminal justice that she deserves,” Rahmani said last month. The McCormack family previously filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Durst in 2019, but the case was thrown out because it was filed too late. The judge in that case said, however, the case could be revived if Durst were to face criminal charges in connection with his first wife’s death. McCormack disappeared in 1982 and her body was never found. At the time of disappearance, she was a medical student, who was preparing to become a pediatrician. Her family has said Durst was abusive, and that she had previously required treatment in a hospital for injuries he caused. Durst married Charatan in December 2000. Abrams alleged in a previous lawsuit, now under appeal, that Charatan wed Durst to help him evade authorities after the investigation into McCormack’s disappearance was reopened. Charatan has never been charged with a crime in the case, and her lawyers said in court papers in 2019 that she bears no responsibility related to McCormack’s disappearance, which occurred six years before she met Robert Durst. Attorney Scott Epstein said allegations against her were based on rumor “more suitable for a work of fiction”. “The plaintiffs’ claims are at best an example of the most extreme form of speculation and at worst nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to publicly embarrass and extort money from Ms Charatan, an innocent party, who is perceived by the plaintiffs as a deep pocket,” Epstein wrote. Durst’s suspected involvement in three killings in three states was documented in the 2015 HBO documentary series The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst. The series chronicled McCormack’s disappearance, Berman’s murder and the 2001 death of Durst’s neighbor, Morris Black, in Galveston, Texas, where Durst was hiding out while disguised as a deaf-mute woman.
