12/12/2021,"Last week marked a fundamental shift in the way the Conservatives relate to their leader. They are upset and feel betrayed by Boris Johnson, but that’s not the most dangerous feeling. After all, most MPs who backed him did so knowing he had a tenuous relationship with the truth and that he would happily turn over others in order to survive. No, the bigger change is that Tory MPs are now actively discussing who could be the next big winner, as they no longer have confidence in this prime minister’s relationship with the electorate. The vultures are circling. There are plenty of these potential leadership candidates visible, from prominent cabinet ministers holding dinners with ambitious young MPs who they hope will join their campaigns to outsiders who’ve been biding their time on the backbenches. They know that the prime minister is wounded enough for them to fly a little closer than previously.  They see the polls, including today’s for the Observer, which has the Tory party on its lowest share of the vote since August 2019 at 32%, and Johnson’s approval ratings at an all-time low. They’ve been on the doorstep in North Shropshire, where voters were already angry before news broke of the partying in Downing Street last Christmas. And they’ve had more than enough flak from their own constituency associations to know the government is no longer being given the benefit of the doubt. Even MPs who still think Johnson is the person to back for now accept that the Christmas party row has had huge cut-through. “My constituents have brought it up, yes,” concedes one loyalist. “But often just ridiculing me for not getting an invite.” Perhaps even more worryingly, a number of Conservative MPs report falling trust in the vaccine programme. One, who has previously been a Johnson supporter and still wants the PM to do well, tells me: “I’ve been getting emails from pro-vaxxers saying, ‘I’ve just had my third injection in a matter of months; what more do you want from me?’” This should seriously concern Johnson because he has been banking on the goodwill from the success of the vaccine programme. It seems he may have taken so much political credit from this one thing that has gone well for the government that he is now in the red. One MP who understands the party well says: “There’s a view that a line has been crossed and it’s about competency and respect for the office of prime minister.” Some MPs might not care about either of those things if Johnson is still capable of keeping their party in government, but the problem is they aren’t sure about that either. “He’s like a used-car salesman who sticks glue in the tank in order to stop the car knocking. You don’t go back to that salesman and buy another car, do you?” Another senior Tory explains: “They thought he was this magic, natural-born winner. But the magic is pretty shaky and it’s not going to stop being shaky. His judgment is so poor and it’s a clear pattern here, with at least three things – Dominic Cummings, Owen Paterson and now the Christmas party – which creates a narrative rather than a sense these are one-off events. They know now there will always be a next one.” The question is how many “next ones” will there be before the vultures swoop? They are carrion birds, only feasting when it’s game over rather than killing off live prey. And none of them thinks things have reached that stage yet. When the government’s plan B measures come before the Commons this week, Johnson will be further wounded. At least 60 Conservative MPs have said they are not going to support the measures, which include vaccine passports. Again, Johnson has aggravated the rebels by thinking aloud about the possibility of mandatory vaccinations and by introducing the restrictions at an earlier stage of the spread of the Omicron variant than he had previously indicated. Previous revolts have left a majority of Conservative MPs, even those who still plan to back the government on Tuesday, without any confidence in the assurances of the prime minister that this really will be the last time he turns off the economy to stop a new wave of Covid infections. They expect that in the new year, they will be asked once again to march through the lobbies supporting even tighter and less liberal measures. Even if the Tories lose the North Shropshire byelection, there is not a prospect of an imminent vote of no confidence in the prime minister. For one thing, his opponents know that if it came now, he would win it in the same way Theresa May, who was visibly weaker than him, won hers. One says: “I want him to go. But now would be the wrong time to reach the threshold [of letters calling for a no-confidence vote].” But even Johnson’s supporters tell me they have given him three months to turn things around before it’s too late. This might still be too short a timeframe for some of the vultures, who need a little longer to shore up support. Backers of Rishi Sunak, for instance, think he needs to show he has more experience before he has a chance of winning a leadership contest. He and the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, have been conspicuously dining backbenchers, though have largely kept their operations deniable by restricting these meals to the 2019 intake of MPs, therefore enabling them to say they’re just getting to know their new colleagues. Truss is the most popular in leadership league tables, but many Conservatives have been bewildered by her recent photoshoot on a tank in Estonia. “That went down very badly in the tearoom,” reports one MP. “It’s almost heresy to pass yourself off as Thatcher in such an obvious way. Allow other people to draw the comparisons rather than doing it so nakedly yourself.” It seems that trying to dress up as Margaret Thatcher is tantamount in Tory circles to the offence of impersonating a police officer. “It’s also the thing you do if you’ve not had to make any serious decisions yet,” snipes a backbencher. Truss and Sunak aren’t the only vultures. Indeed, one of the blessings for the prime minister is the sheer number of hopeful replacements in the skies above him. “There is no dauphin,” explains a Conservative. “A majority of people don’t know who to switch to.” The right of the party have been talking up Dominic Raab as their possible candidate. Some MPs report the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, being particularly assiduous in the tearoom. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, made it known he was “upset” by the video of Downing Street staffers joking about their partying exploits. Others like the way Tom Tugendhat, chair of the foreign affairs select committee, has built a serious profile for himself outside government. Johnson does still have his cabinet backers, despite the list of ambitious ministers above. Some are exasperated that the wider party doesn’t understand that vaccine passports have to be measured as a method of behavioural change in getting those who are hesitant to take up a jab and lead to the end of restrictions rather than years of disruption. Others think the problem lies in his staff team – those that are left, anyway. When Allegra Stratton quit last week, the knives were also out in No 10 for comms chief Jack Doyle, given he was responsible for the government’s untenable messaging about the party he had reportedly attended while Stratton chose to go home. MPs are more annoyed with Johnson’s chief of staff, Dan Rosenfeld, who they think has no understanding of how the party works. The prime minister has also managed to alienate many of the people who backed him when he wasn’t a dead cert to win the Tory leadership. “He’s not shown a degree of loyalty to anyone who was close to him on the leadership,” says one such early supporter. “But he has shown immense loyalty to people who weren’t involved, like Hancock and Raab. He’s lost a lot of us, like Jake Berry, Robert Jenrick and so on. If Jenrick had been in government he would have gone out to defend him this week when no one else did. But he’s dropped him too.” Even if Downing Street has a relaunch in the new year with new staff and a better comms operation, Johnson won’t have changed. That was one of the things that attracted Tories and voters to him in the first place: he’s not someone who rebrands himself according to the political weather, but is his own man who doesn’t care if people see his flaws. But that attribute can be in itself a flaw because MPs don’t have faith that he will become someone they can trust again. And he is so used to getting away with it, he doesn’t seem to realise how vulnerable he is. “There is a real risk that he could end up in a Theresa May situation of him being in No 10 and not in power for a year,” warns a supporter. But May was in that position because she lost the Tory majority in an election. It would be quite something if Johnson ended up with the same troubles from the comfort of being a winner.

12/12/2021,"The cyclones that repeatedly hit his village deep in Bangladesh’s south did not just bring waist-high water that washed everything away, they forced Shayma Kanta Mistri to make a choice about his future. The salt waters that had surged in from the nearby Bay of Bengal ruined his paddy fields, which were already providing only a tenuous living that had to be supplemented by seasonal labouring for other farmers. Mistri needed to adapt or leave.  Everywhere in Shyamnagar, there are signs of people refusing to just accept that climate change will force them to move. This is the most south-western part of Satkhira district and one of the areas in Bangladesh most vulnerable to the climate crisis. Rice fields have been turned into ponds by owners who realise their land will not easily recover and so have begun farming crab and shrimp. People are fighting back to avoid the fate of thousands of others, who have had to leave for overcrowded cities, broken by the effects of global heating on their land and their lives. “We faced so many cyclones – Sidr, Aila, Bulbul, Amphan – and they brought waters that came up to here on the street,” said Mistri, holding his hand at waist level. “When the waters left it was like a desert, all the plants and trees were dying from the salt and there was no clear water to drink either. There were only a few people with money who could survive these conditions. “We could not live from farming any longer. We had to think about other ways to make our living.” Mistri had planned to start a shrimp farm but was encouraged by Practical Action, a charity that helps smallholder farmers, and its local partner Shushilan, to move into crab farming because it had a low start-up cost and crabs were less vulnerable to white spot syndrome, a virus that plagues shrimp farms. Now he can make an average of 2,000 taka (£17.60) per day by selling 100kg of soft-shell crabs from 2kg of crablets that he buys from local fishermen. He had previously only run a nursery, rearing the crablets and then selling junior crabs to bigger crab farms, but taught himself the sensitive and valuable technique of harvesting the crab at the moment it sheds its hard shell. “Now I’m more comfortable. We have a more secure income and both of my children are in school – my son has almost graduated from college,” said Mistri. Aside from the profit, the quick turnaround means he earns throughout the year, softening the losses of the storms that can leave rice farmers without an income for months because of the crop damage and time it takes to prepare the land. Satkhira and the south-west have borne the brunt of the weather changes, repeatedly being hit by major cyclones that have displaced millions and caused permanent changes to the land. During last year’s cyclone Amphan winds hit 151kmph and flooded a quarter of Satkhira, which the UN said was the worst-hit district. According to a 2016 study from the University of Jessore (now Jashore), two-thirds of migrants from south-western Bangladesh moved because they had to give up farming. Most went to cities where they worked as day labourers, while some did seasonal agricultural work. Those who were able to stay were people who had diversified, especially crab and shrimp farmers. Practical Action’s field coordinator, AJM Shafiqul Islam, said the charity’s work is about ensuring people are offered the most suitable solution and support to help build their resilience to the climate crisis. “Since cyclone Sidr [in 2007], the people of this area have struggled with salinity in their soil but these methods are transforming lives. Shayma had very little before but now he has a poultry farm alongside the crabs that he built with the income. He no longer has to travel to sell his labour,” said Islam. “This works for the farmers who have limited income. It helps them work with the change of their land and also hopefully it will stop them having to migrate. They will be able to live sustainably.” The threat to Shyamnagar’s people is evident on Gabura, an island encircled by two rivers of the Sundarbans mangrove forest, which is frequently inundated during cyclones and is losing its coast to erosion. Locals live in fragile homes mounted on stilts, and say a quarter of people have now given up and moved elsewhere. Those who remain are reliant on catching crabs or collecting honey from the forest but their income is curtailed by government limits to protect the forest’s resources. Islam says Practical Action’s work is also about bringing balance. “These farmers look to wild sources like the river or the Sunderbans, which is vulnerable environmentally and needs to be protected. The government is also establishing crab hatcheries but someone has to raise them, so these crab nurseries for smallholder farmers can be the intermediaries,” said Islam. That balance also applies to other methods being encouraged here, such as teaching farmers how to grow extra vegetables in the mud walkways between plots of land. Archana Boyda, 24, provides farmers in her area with compost using dung from her two cows and earthworms she was given by the charity. Boyda has six vats of her compost in a tent outside her home. She had been living in a leaking mud hut that was destroyed by a falling tree during cyclone Amphan. But Boyda had been saving the 3,000 taka she earned a month with her husband and they have built a new wooden house on a platform raised above any floodwaters. “Amphan had a really big effect on us, the house was destroyed and we had nowhere to go so we just tried to cover the gaps with sheets. This house is still not finished but it is so much better and our life is becoming more secure, step by step,” she said.

12/12/2021,"One of the best things about old-school gardening advice is how it connects us, in a very direct way, with our shared heritage. However, by the same token, many practices can keep us tethered to cultural ideas that are long past their practical or even aesthetic relevance. Just like the fact that we now know the incredibly laborious Victorian practice of double-digging each autumn ironically degrades soil, reduces fertility and even releases atmospheric carbon. I think it’s high time we add ditching the slavish devotion to leaf-raking to the list of outdated practices. The basic idea behind this traditional task is really just one of neatness, harking back to an era where regimented precision of perfect lawn stripes and rows of bedding plants like a horticultural military parade were considered a universal goal for all “good” gardeners.  Fallen leaves not only ruined the illusion of a plot under the complete control of the human hand but, it was argued, could smother garden plants under a thick blanket of rotting matter, encouraging pests and stifling growth. So gathering up this biodegradable matter, shoving it in endless plastic sacks and loading it on lorries to landfill was considered an excellent use of time and resources. However, the scientific reality is that by doing so gardeners essentially turned trees into nutrient pumps, drawing minerals out of the ground to create their canopies each spring, then carting off these nutrients which would otherwise be returned to the soil, slowly but surely degrading its fertility. Of course, leaves don’t just provide a free source of fertiliser, the organic fibres they are made out of also improve soil texture, helping it absorb far more water and air, which are essential for healthy plant growth. Ironically, as most plants you would grow under trees are adapted to woodland environments, not only will the vast majority be unfazed by autumnal leaf cover, but they will actively benefit from the protective layer nutrient-rich fallen leaves provide, sealing in moisture while insulating from harsh winter temperatures. Even on lawns, scientific studies have shown that as long as about 50% of the surface remains uncovered, fallen leaves not only improve grass growth next year, but can impede the growth of weeds such as dandelions. Simply removing the excess leaves in places where they are too dense on lawns and chucking it on flower, fruit and veg borders will give you free fertiliser and soil conditioner while simultaneously slashing your workload. So the moral of the story, much like digging, is that a little raking to clear paths or prevent the total covering of lawns can certainly have merit, but simply abandoning the chore of wholesale leaf removal not only is better for your back, but the planet, and frankly your garden, too.

12/12/2021,"Don’t socialise, said Dr Jenny Harries, the chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, discussing the spread of a new Covid variant, if you “don’t particularly need to”. Well. Upon hearing this I immediately began breaking the concept down into digestible parts. What is social? What is need? What is the thing where you are fizzing with excitement at the promise of going out but then, after dragging your best dry-clean-only to the bar through sodden cold and joining a conversation about dairy, you feel suddenly extremely weary and in urgent need of silence? Is that the “particularly” clause? Is that the “don’t”? It’s sage advice, admittedly, even without the threat of death. The need to socialise has been brought into sharp relief over the past two years, the need to hold a hand that’s not your own, the need to bitch a little shittily about celebrity affairs, the need to simply eat a meal you have not toasted yourself. But many of us have also found, between the yearning and loneliness, some forgotten pleasure in being alone. Many of us also have performed a sometimes-unconscious winnowing of friendships, streamlining our social lives so we now need only leave the house for people we love, friends who are going to make us laugh, or strangers whose presence will improve our posture, bringing out our best and hidden selves.  The absence of socialising has allowed us to consider it more carefully than ever before, what it’s for, what it does for us, what we become when it is taken away. Why we can dread it, too, and we have understood afresh our anxiety around parties. Today, scarred by the pandemic and fattened by its lockdowns, we have the opportunity to organise our wobbling calendars around these lessons we’ve learned, rather than fling ourselves into it headfirst as if a pile of leaves. “Don’t socialise if you don’t particularly need to” – here is a phrase that might save a generation from five years of weak drinks and bad sex, a phrase that has the potential to smother the idea of fomo like paper round rock. Sure, it has been known to happen, that a mediocre invitation leads to adventure and certain small blisses. I am aware of pub visits that, at 11pm, cracked open to reveal romance, chips, a particular kind of back-of-bus decadence, but for every one of those there are 10 of the other. Ten jolly jaunts to a second location where what can only be described as the “vibe” sours and ferments within seconds, suddenly shining a virtual black light on all the night’s stains. Ten horror films for every romcom, 10 awkward encounters with someone called Nik or Bunny, 10 drinks drunk before revealing a wet cigarette at the bottom of the glass. I had been considering throwing a Christmas party, but do I particularly need to? Last week’s episode of Succession helped answer my question. Kendall Roy threw a party in the shape of a breakdown, a strobe-lit, loveless, haunted playground of a 40th, a roiling psychodrama soundtracked by the Chemical Brothers. “I took the wrong drugs in the wrong order,” hisses his brother-in-law Tom, “and I can’t get happy.” Upon watching this antipathy party where, even through three layers of screen, viewers could taste the cocaine in the back of their throats, I deleted my guestlist. I did not particularly need, no, to throw a party right now, when the risk of it being an anxiety-superspreader event was high. I could suddenly picture it – friends wielding negative Covid tests as they stepped gingerly into my tinsel-strangled home. Music playing in fitful starts, the wifi gently weeping under the sudden weight of strange phones. Someone dancing bravely alone in the living room. I would have got the snacks all wrong of course – little bowls of tuna pasta with a ketchup garnish, bits of apple scattered across occasional tables, some tepid Muller Corners. Mulled cava on arrival, the simple request that everybody asked to bring their own straw. The two people who managed to hook up, against all odds and with their partners sleeping at home, would inevitably conceive, despite being nearly 50 and with laminated statements of infertility from their doctor. All the fantasies of celebration I’d been harbouring since ignoring a series of birthdays deflated with one prick of the UK Health Security Agency’s pin. Did I particularly need to socialise? Or was I, in fact, being a whingy little baby, desperate to relive the parties of my childhood where I was the special girl allowed to eat as much cake as I wanted while someone’s brother drank everyone’s Ribena and vomited on the coats? Did I want to see these people, my friends, or had the pandemic curdled our relationships to the point where we no longer had anything to say beyond the shiverly, “So what have you been up to?” Was it simply a mass of people that I wanted, their unventilated bodies, their cracker outstretched and looking for dip? Or did I need them? Did I particularly need them, as a living monument to survival? Did I particularly need to gather people around me, in laughter and candlelight, proof I was known and proof I existed? Well, Dr Harries, the jury’s out.

12/12/2021,"This summer, Riz Ahmed took aim at Hollywood and the wider film industry. In a speech that was somehow both measured and searingly furious, the British actor called out the “toxic portrayals” of Muslim characters in TV and movies. Using research that he was directly involved in commissioning, Ahmed showed how Muslims, who make up almost a quarter of the world’s population, are either “invisible or villains” in our screen entertainment. He said that this omission resulted not just in “lost audiences” but “lost lives” because of the “dehumanising and demonising” ways that Muslims were often depicted. In fact, Ahmed noted, some of the most prestigious and awards-laden releases of recent years were “frankly racist”: specifically The Hurt Locker and Argo, both of which won best picture at the Oscars, and Marvel’s Black Panther, which earned more than $1bn at the box office. The speech in June, which launched an initiative called the Blueprint for Muslim Inclusion, was many things: timely, vital and, for some, eye-opening. But mainly, on Ahmed’s part, it felt brave, even risky. Actors typically don’t take potshots at their paymasters, the studios. They almost never single out specific, very successful films for criticism.  “If you’re going to say something, say it, I guess, right?” says Ahmed today. “I’m not trying to attack anyone personally, it’s just about trying to call out a collective blind spot. So am I worried it would have a knockback on my career? I dunno…” Ahmed pauses, starts again. “You know, this is all just a bonus,” he goes on. “I never expected I’d be able to have a career. They haven’t noticed I’ve snuck in. They are going to throw me out any minute. It’s probably that kind of thing. Nick all the sweets while you can. Trash the place. Tell them whatever you want. Maybe there’s some of that going on.” He won’t say it himself, but right now Ahmed has the run of the sweet shop. After years of sustained excellence, working his way up through acclaimed indies such as Chris Morris’s Four Lions and the Reluctant Fundamentalist, then smaller parts in Hollywood spectaculars (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Venom), 2021 was the year that Ahmed landed centre stage. In April, he was nominated for a best actor Oscar for his performance in Sound of Metal as Ruben, a heavy-metal drummer who loses his hearing. He didn’t win, but the fact that he was the first Muslim ever to be nominated in that category started a debate that Ahmed has taken on. This month, he became the youngest recipient of the Richard Harris Award, the highest honour from Bifa (the British Independent Film Awards). In the citation, it praised “his outstanding work, both on-screen and off”. This has been a busy, creatively fertile period for Ahmed. He also co-wrote and starred in Mogul Mowgli, a semi-autobiographical tale of a self-involved rapper who is diagnosed with an autoimmune disease and has to trade a big tour of Europe for life back at home with his English-Pakistani family. The film was soundtracked by much of Ahmed’s own music, which came from his 2020 album The Long Goodbye. Ahmed has always made music – first as an MC and then as part of a rap duo, Swet Shop Boys – but that didn’t lessen the surprise of some critics that he really knows what he’s doing. “Ahmed’s ability to weave experience and cultural touchstones into an affecting tale of heartache, loss, and redemption is something of a marvel,” was the verdict of hard-to-please music review website Pitchfork. We’re talking this evening over Zoom, because of a Covid scare – mine, not his. Ahmed is in a London hotel, waiting for a Bafta Q&A event to start and picks at some dinner. “Just some kind of salad situation,” he says, “I think there’s lentils in it…” Ahmed’s dressed up, in a smart, striped jacket from Australian designers Song for the Mute, and I tell him it reminds me of early lockdown when everyone, going mad, did video-call eat-alongs. “Did people do that?” asks Ahmed, then mock-offended: “No one invited me!” Ahmed looks back on his Oscar nomination as a “rollercoaster, innit?” Mainly, though, he was stunned by it. Sound of Metal was not expected to be a film that would be shortlisted for six Academy Awards. It had a first-time director, Darius Marder, and a script that knocked around in different forms for more than 10 years. One of the delays was because of Marder having difficulty finding a lead actor who would commit to the regimen he demanded for the character of Ruben. Finally, the director met with Ahmed, a man who could never be accused of lacking dedication. For eight months, Ahmed spent two hours a day each on learning sign language, having drum lessons and working out with a trainer. The rest of the time, he prepped with an acting coach. Even that was almost not enough. The day before Sound of Metal was due to shoot, the production lost its financing. Only a final-hour scramble from Marder got it back on track. “You really don’t know if anyone will see a film like that,” says Ahmed. “It’s like, here’s a dude, he’s never made a film before; here’s a script, been around for 10 years, can’t get it made; getting money for it, you get like 10p. You gotta learn all this shit, it could all go horribly wrong. “No one wanted to make this film,” he exclaims, his dark eyes alert and flickering, like a meerkat guarding its mound. “You couldn’t finance this film! No one wanted to put me in that role in this film, no one. For whatever reason, it didn’t make sense to people.” That Sound of Metal even exists then is a hail-mary; that it went on to be nominated for Baftas and Oscars is altogether more unexpected and impressive. And so, when it started being noticed that a Muslim had never previously been in the running for the most prestigious acting award, Ahmed felt conflicted. “Some people go like, ‘Oh, first Muslim, this and that,’” he says. “And your initial reaction is like, ‘What’s that got to do with anything?’ Then you have another feeling: ‘But actually, wait that is relevant, insofar as like, why hasn’t this happened before? That’s weird.’ So always that kind of push and pull.” Ahmed continues to feel that push and pull; he has it now in our interview. It would be much more straightforward to talk about learning to play the drums, instead of having to explain why it matters that, in the 200 most popular films made between 2017 and 2019, only 1.6% of the nearly 9,000 speaking characters were Muslim. That, in 181 of those 200 films, there were no Muslim characters at all. “There’s a voice in my head right now that’s just going, ‘Oh my God, come on, get off this stuff, man!’” Ahmed admits. “Like 70% of my interviews end up being about politics and representation and all that.” Partly Ahmed reasons that, if he doesn’t do it, who will? But also, his resolve has been stiffened by Covid, a period in which his aunt and uncle both died from the virus. “We’re just here for this long, man!” he says, snapping his fingers. “A lot of us lost a lot of people. You’re just here for two seconds so you’ve got to try and worry about something bigger than yourself because, guess what? None of us are getting out of this alive!” Ahmed laughs, shakes his head. “I dunno,” he sighs, “I’m sounding incredibly fucking pretentious.” Ahmed has always had a disruptive streak. He was born in Wembley, north London, to Pakistani parents; he didn’t start to speak English until he went to school when he was six. Instead, he stayed at home with his mum, his “best friend”, speaking Urdu, watching comedy sketch shows such as Fifty Fifty, which was loosely based on Saturday Night Live. Aged 11, Ahmed won a scholarship to a private school, Merchant Taylors’, whose alumni include archbishops and Nobel laureates. “I had quite a volcanic energy as a kid,” Ahmed recalls. “I remember in my first week of school, I put a chair through the window. I was quite lucky really I had some teachers that were like, ‘Right, we’ve got to channel this somehow.’” One teacher, Mr Roseblade, told him that if he wanted to get into a decent university, he should become involved in extracurricular projects. This – and his innate skill for arguing with everyone – led to debating and drama. “It was really, really, really genuinely just therapeutic for me,” says Ahmed. “You are not allowed to feel intense emotions in your day-to-day life: it’s not safe or it’s not cool or it’s not the done thing. And it’s like, ‘What do I do with all this shit? They’re telling me I’ll get kicked out if I feel these things so where do you want me to put it?’ So it was a space where anything’s possible.” Ahmed made it to Oxford University, where he studied philosophy, politics and economics, hated it, wanted to leave, stuck it out. He did some acting there, but when he graduated, he was half-hearted about pursuing it. “I thought, ‘It’s not realistic, so I’ll just apply for one drama school and if I don’t get in, then it’s not meant to be,” he says. “And I applied to Central School of Speech and Drama for the one-year MA classical acting course. I thought, ‘I want to be in and out in one year. Let’s not prolong this inevitable car crash.’” Why “car crash”? Ahmed points out that with the exception of the sketch comedy Goodness Gracious Me, which ran on the BBC from 1998 to 2001, there was little to indicate there were any opportunities for British South Asians in entertainment. “You’ve got to remember, things feel really different now, but this was 2004, 2005,” says Ahmed. “Let’s pull up IMDb for 2004, pull out the Radio Times, show me where and how I’m earning a living for my family? Show me how I’m able to apply my craft and do so with dignity? It’s just not a thing.” In 2007, the director Danny Boyle was on the hunt for the lead for his new movie Slumdog Millionaire. Ahmed auditioned but lost out to the Skins actor Dev Patel. “When Slumdog Millionaire came up, I’d already been working for a few years,” says Ahmed. “And it was like, ‘There’s never been anything like this! A lead role in a film and it’s for a young brown dude.’ And when I didn’t get it, straight away, I was like, ‘Well, that’s it, it’s done, there’s not going to be another one of those.’” A turning point for Ahmed came in his early 30s, around 2013. He was getting by in the UK, but the work, he admits, “had kind of dried up”. On a night out in London with Idris Elba, he asked for advice. “He was like, ‘You should go to America,’” says Ahmed. “And I said, ‘Now what would they do with someone like me over there? There’s no point.’ And he just said, ‘Don’t categorise yourself. Even if they do.’” Ahmed booked a ticket, and one of his first auditions was for the psychological thriller Nightcrawler, and a character called Rick – which he liked because it didn’t immediately identify him as Muslim or a person of colour – who worked for Jake Gyllenhaal’s ambulance-chasing news service. This then led to a career-defining turn in the HBO series The Night Of, in which he was a student who has a one-night stand with a white woman and then finds her brutally murdered. The role won Ahmed an Emmy, and his feet have scarcely touched the ground since. “The promised land,” is what Ahmed calls the phase of his career that he’s entered. In an essay in 2016 for The Good Immigrant, a book about race and immigration in the UK, he defined it as a place “where you play a character whose story is not intrinsically linked to his race. There, I am not a terror suspect, nor a victim of forced marriage. There, my name might even be Dave.” Ruben in the Sound of Metal is a “promised land” role. So is Ahmed’s new film Encounter, in which he plays Malik (the character, in the original script, was called Marcus, but Ahmed pushed for the name change, because he thought it would add “layers and psychological conflict”). Malik is a former Marine, and father of two sons, who believes that parasites are invading earth and assuming control of human hosts. In desperation, he takes his children on a road trip to keep them safe. Ahmed suspected he wasn’t an obvious candidate for Encounter and that made him more determined to land the role. He is known for going deep in his preparations: if a part requires an accent, he’s talking that way, day and night, throughout the shoot. But what intrigued and scared him about Encounter was that Malik was a father, albeit an unconventional one who lets his kids eat as much ice-cream as they want and blow off steam by firing his gun. “It’s good sometimes to not know fully what you’re doing, because if you’re not fully in control, interesting things can happen,” Ahmed reasons. “You know, ‘I’m shitting it because I don’t know how to be a dad. Oh, that’s what Malik feels.’ So you lean into that fear a little bit.” The pandemic era has seen major changes for Ahmed personally as well as professionally. Last year, he married the American novelist Fatima Farheen Mirza, whom he met in a café in New York when he was filming Sound of Metal. “We were both jostling over the same laptop plug points,” he told the talkshow host Jimmy Fallon. Ahmed, who still mainly lives in west London, is clearly a private sort, but hints that Covid was at least partly responsible for his decision to marry. “In the pandemic, spending more time at home, sitting with yourself a bit more, that was really clarifying in lots of ways,” he says, when I ask how life has changed since his wedding. “Particularly losing loved ones. Like I said, before you know it, this will all be over. So work out what matters to you, stand by it and just don’t fuck about. Get on with it!” It’s time to wrap up our chat; I finish by asking Ahmed what he hopes his legacy will be. It’s a clichéd interview standard and he smiles, cuts straight through the bullshit: “I’m only 38 years old, bro! Do you know something I don’t? Do I need to get a fucking doctor’s checkup now? Shit, what did they tell you, man?” Still, I persevere: does Ahmed want to be remembered for his acting and his music? Or is his real aim set on bringing about systemic change in representation in the film industry? Ahmed turns serious for a moment and, eyes blazing, fires back, “Do I have to pick between the two?” Encounter is out now on Amazon Prime Photographer’s assistant Jack Storer; styling assistant Florence Armstrong; tailor Nick James; grooming by Tara Hickman using Armani",Arts/Culture,"‘You’ve got to try and worry about something bigger than yourself’: Riz Ahmed on rap, racism and standing up to Hollywood",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/dec/12/youve-got-to-try-and-worry-about-something-bigger-than-yourself-riz-ahmed-on-rap-racism-and-standing-up-to-hollywood
12/12/2021,"Mwalimu Shakur could only talk for six minutes. Shakur is at California’s Corcoran state prison, where there have been 1,290 Covid cases and seven deaths since the pandemic hit. During our phone call just before Thanksgiving, the prison was on the verge of graduating from the tight phase one reopening protocols that typically follow an outbreak – just as millions of Americans on the outside prepared to mark the milestone of an in-person holiday season. This meant that Shakur and the other 3,604 men at Corcoran were allotted just one hour each day to shower and stand in line for the handful of phones.  Phase two would grant the men an additional 30 minutes out of cell, and the return of in-person visits. But it hadn’t happened yet. “That’s supposed to be starting today, so we’ll see,” Shakur told me. Someone was waiting for the phone, so he had to go. Even as Covid infection rates begin to climb across the US, the arrival of vaccines and boosters have made many feel like the pandemic is over. In prisons, however, life looks much like it did at the start of the pandemic. Quarantines and lockdowns remain common, along with confusing and conflicting information from the people in charge. For incarcerated people nationwide, it’s almost as if the spring of 2020 keeps repeating itself. I’ve spent years reporting on prison conditions across the country – conditions that were often deplorable even before Covid hit. Last March, when I began receiving letters from incarcerated people detailing their experiences of the pandemic, those early letters mirrored the confusion promulgated by top government authorities about the virus. Now, nearly two years later, many describe policies that seem more punitive than preventive. Inside prisons across the US, 34 of every 100 people are known to have been infected with Covid, nearly four times the infection rate of the general US population. Public health researchers cite crowding as a major contributing factor; several state prison systems and the federal Bureau of Prisons are operating past 100% capacity. All the while, incarcerated people have reported being stuck in cramped cells and crowded dorms with little access to PPE, soap, or other cleaning supplies, among prison staff who often flout masking protocols with little consequence. “I think the most disturbing thing for me is the no-mask guards,” says “Alice”, who incarcerated in the federal prison in Aliceville, Alabama, which has remained crowded throughout the pandemic. (Alice asked that her real name be withheld to avoid retaliation.) But Alice cites other concerns, too: large numbers of unvaccinated people; a lack of testing; mingling between units in the dining hall during lunch. She has stopped going to lunch altogether. “In some ways, I feel like a sitting duck, with another wave of Covid just around the corner,” Alice says. “The flimsy cotton masks we are given are no comfort there, either.” Alice isn’t just worried for her health. Over the summer, she says that women who exhibited Covid-like symptoms were taken to solitary confinement, where they spent 23 hours alone in a cell. “Conditions there were horrendous, and some people were truly traumatized by that experience and still talk about it in my unit,” she says. Meanwhile, the remaining women were locked in their cells for 23 hours each day, with one hour allowed for phone calls and showers. Elena House-Hay, age 25, is one of 992 prisoners at Pennsylvania’s Muncy women’s prison, where more than 500 Covid cases have been reported since the pandemic began. Like Alice, she dreads the thought of another outbreak. After testing positive for the virus last winter, House-Hay says she had to drag all her belongings through the snow to the prison’s quarantine unit, an open dormitory with 32 cubicles that each contained two bunk beds. During the two 30-minute periods the women were allowed out of cell each day, they had to choose between showering or standing in line to phone home, send mail or sync their prison-issued tablets to receive and send e-messages. It was a miserable experience. “I’m more afraid of the psychological consequences of another lockdown than I am of getting sick,” says House-Hay. The persistent threat of Covid in prisons has taken a painful toll on the loved ones of those who are incarcerated. Though the majority of prison systems have reinstated outside visits, many have placed restrictive new visitation guidelines into place. At Muncy, for instance, House-Hay reports that the women are allowed to briefly hug but not kiss their visitors. They can no longer share food from the prison’s vending machines, nor can children sit on their incarcerated parent’s lap. But some jails and prisons have not reinstated visits. The Spokane county jail in Washington state is among those that have not; the facility was also slow to adopt video calls, which only became available this July. For Maddesyn George, who was arrested in July 2020, the lack of video or in-person visits meant missing a year of her baby daughter’s life. She watched her daughter Shynne grow from a four-month-old infant to a 19-month-old toddler through photographs that her parents mailed. Now, she can see her on a screen for half an hour – but only if Shynne can stay focused on the computer. Even in prisons that have reinstated visits, dramatic new restrictions on visiting hours pose another barrier to in-person family contact. Before the pandemic, Aliceville offered six-hour visits on weekends, and family members could visit both days. Now, visits are limited to one hour behind glass. At Muncy, pre-pandemic visits could last all day if visitors were traveling more than three hours, or if the visiting room wasn’t busy, and guests could visit for several days in a row; today, they get one two-and-a-half-hour visit a week. For both House-Hay and Alice, whose families live hundreds of miles from their respective prisons, the curtailed lengths have been prohibitive. Alice takes advantage of the free video calls offered at Aliceville, scheduling three to four each week with her partner and children. While they’re “certainly better than nothing,” Alice says the calls are no replacement for in-person visits. But for now, the Bureau of Prisons says that Aliceville’s visiting hours will not be extended, nor will contact visits be reinstated because of the fluctuating transmission rate in the surrounding community. “At this point, prisons are using the utter mismanagement of Covid as an excuse to not reinstate normal operations,” says Alice. “[Due to] their lack of Covid prevention measures, [they will] prolong the pandemic inside – and, with it, all the restrictions and hardships.” For House-Hay, the winter seems a bit more promising. Pennsylvania began offering prisoners incentives for vaccinations early on; in Muncy, that has resulted in the full vaccination of 78% of incarcerated people (as opposed to just 45% of staff). Because she is vaccinated, House-Hay is allowed to borrow books from the prison library, spend time in the prison yard, work at the prison metal shop and eat meals outside her cell. She makes Christmas decorations and plays games with friends in the common area. “It is not normal,” she says, “but it is not stagnation.”",News/World news,"Covid lockdown: for incarcerated Americans, pandemic hardships are unremitting",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/12/prisons-covid-lockdown-hardships-us
12/12/2021,"Do we really need a remake of West Side Story? Having won 10 Oscars (a record for a musical), including best picture, Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins’s 1961 screen incarnation of the 1957 Broadway musical hit remains a much-loved and much-watched “classic”; a self-consciously streetwise affair with weapons-grade earworm tunes and choreography that kids would try to mimic in school playgrounds for decades. Yet even the most ardent fan of the original would have to admit that time has not been kind to the sight of Natalie Wood playing a Latina. Hooray, then, for screen newcomer Rachel Zegler, who landed the lead role of Maria from an open casting call, and whose vibrantly natural performance almost singlehandedly justifies this “reimagining” from director Steven Spielberg. The story, which transposes the star-crossed lovers of Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet from Renaissance-era Verona to postwar New York, hardly needs rehearsing. Suffice to say that Spielberg’s version opens with what could be an outtake from the later stages of Saving Private Ryan – an aerial view of what looks like a bomb site, over which a wrecking ball ominously hangs. This is the stamping ground of the Jets, the white gang fighting a turf war with their sworn Puerto Rican enemies, the Sharks.  Ansel Elgort is Tony, a one-time troublemaker now attempting to put his past behind him. When Tony falls for Maria at a dance designed to bring harmony between warring clans (a “social experiment”), he incurs the wrath of friends and foes alike. With a once-and-for-all rumble on the cards, into which gang leader Riff (the sinewy Mike Faist) seems determined to drag his old friend, the scene is set for cross-cultural tragedy of love and death. Shot in handsome widescreen vistas by Janusz Kaminski, Spielberg’s West Side Story starts with a strangely subdued palette that bursts into vibrant colour during skirt-swirling dancehall showdowns. Early scenes of the Jets staking out their turf call to mind the ragged street urchins from Lionel Bart’s Oliver!, another stage musical hit that became a 60s screen staple. Yet while Jon M Chu’s recent screen adaptation of In the Heights gave us wall-walking scenes that adventurously turned the world on its side, Spielberg and Kaminski lean into the simpler, low-angle, 45-degree tilts that have become common parlance in New York gang movies. As for the set-piece songs, Elgort struggles to breathe much life into Maria, his voice tinged with a touch of the Tony Hadleys whenever he gets into his upper register. It’s a shortcoming laid bare when he duets with Zegler, the agility of her voice putting his to shame. Odd, too, that Elgort, a hoofer who literally danced his way through the opening credits of Baby Driver, seems somewhat flat-footed when compared to his springy Jet counterparts. Could this duck-lipped, baby-faced Tony really have been just one punch away from murder? Where Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner’s version comes into its own is in the moments where it dares to find its own distinct voice – nowhere more so than in placing Somewhere in the hands of Rita Moreno. Having played Anita in the 1961 film, a role thrillingly filled here by Ariana DeBose, Moreno, who also gets an exec-producer credit, comes to embody the heart and soul of this new production. As Valentina, widowed owner of Doc’s Drugstore, Moreno provides the genetic link between the past and the present, lending a sense of gravitas to scenes that might otherwise have teetered into parody. For me, her low-key rendition ofthe song is up there with the opening track of Tom Waits’s 1978 album Blue Valentine, rich in fragile, heartbreaking pathos. Other smart moves include casting the non-binary actor Iris Menas as Anybodys, a performance that has something of the oomph of Linda Manz’s brilliant turn in The Wanderers, repaying the inspirational debt that Philip Kaufman’s 1979 cult classic owed to the Wise/Robbins West Side Story, bringing everything full circle.",Arts/Film,West Side Story review – Spielberg’s remake takes off when it dances to its own tune,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/12/west-side-story-review-steven-spielberg

12/12/2021,"Ayear ago last week, rugby was thrown into turmoil. Steve Thompson, a 2003 World Cup winner, announced that he and seven other former players were launching a lawsuit against World Rugby, the Rugby Football Union and the Welsh Rugby Union, after their diagnoses of dementia or, in the case of the 31-year-old Adam Hughes, post-concussion syndrome. The players with dementia were all in their early 40s. The eight have since been joined by another 150, drawn from the same generation, with a further 75 from rugby league. Fifty more, and counting, wait in the wings weighing up their options. Of the 150, half have been diagnosed, the other half have been tested and await results, but all report similar unnerving symptoms.  Who knows how many others are suffering in silence? And who knows how many more from this generation, the first to play full careers in the professional era, will develop conditions in the next 20 to 30 years? If they are diagnosed before the age of 65, their dementia will be categorised as “early onset”, or unusually young. For anyone in their 30s or early 40s, the odds of such a diagnosis are around one in 10,000. The 75 diagnosed already represent roughly one in 20 of those who played rugby union in England or Wales during the first 15 years of the professional era. The lawsuit is still in its pre-action phase, a routine of information-gathering and posturing between parties. If a settlement cannot be reached, proceedings will be issued, probably in the new year. The best guess is that a date for trial will be set within a couple of years of that. A settlement out of court could bring an end to proceedings but the prospects of this happening any time soon seem remote. The three defendants are governing bodies of a sport that knows the issue of brain injury represents a threat to its very existence. The line they must tread as they try to take responsible steps to address the problem while not admitting liability is delicate. As for the sort of unqualified acknowledgement many would like to see of the gravity of the predicament, such a confession would hardly reassure mums and dads across the world of rugby’s wholesome charms. We should not be surprised, then, that there seems no settlement on the horizon, or that some of the recent releases from the defendants have smacked of jockeying for position in advance of a hearing. Meanwhile, the independent studies keep tumbling in. The Drake Foundation engaged in an extraordinary game of press-release tennis with the RFU recently, each offering its different interpretations of the same study they had partnered up to produce. You can guess whose take was the more airbrushed. Other independent research institutions, such as those at Durham University and the University of South Wales (USW), have weighed in this year with more research that inches us ever closer to certainty about the hideous truth hardwired into collision sports. The more players improve, the more dangerous they become to each other, particularly in the most precious realm of all, that of cognitive health. Worse still, with every study the hypothesis firms up that it is not the arbitrary syndrome known as concussion that is the key factor in one’s risk of developing neurodegenerative disease in later life. So far almost all of rugby’s attempts to address the crisis have focused on concussion management, as have the majority of the findings of the inquiry by the digital, culture, media and sport committee of backbench MPs that was set up this year to look into the relationship between sport and long-term brain injury. The government’s response last week necessarily focused on concussion too, but neuroscience is now virtually certain the decisive variable is the sheer number of blows taken over a long career, otherwise known in the field as “cumulative dose”. What no tweak to the laws has ever achieved – and realistically ever could – is to reduce significantly the number of collisions per match in the modern game, or even just to stop its escalation as the fitness and power of players increases year after year, despite the plateau in their size that was reached circa 2010. A reduction of the blows suffered outside match day is an area for exploration. Under pressure from one of the benefits of the past year, the emergence of independent player-support groups such as Progressive Rugby and Head for Change, World Rugby has issued a recommendation that teams restrict contact training to at most 15 minutes a week. That could only help but, bar perhaps the odd unreconstructed coaching regime, most profess to a bare minimum already. This elicits a more hopeful hypothesis – that the hinterland between the amateur era and the more sophisticated methods of the current will prove a one-off. No consolation for those who played through it, but maybe the prospects for those playing now have already improved. The counter-evidence is a continuing escalation in the intensity of the matches themselves, as charted by burgeoning tackle and ruck counts and soon, we hope, the extensive use of instrumented mouthguards to anatomise the toll on each player in real time. The plan to adopt this technology across the Premiership was recently delayed by another season because, it is understood, the RFU and World Rugby could not agree on which technology to use. The latest studies do not suggest the worst is over. The Drake Foundation released one in the summer that revealed abnormal reductions in white matter in the brains of half of a cohort of current elite players, and axonal injury in 23% of them. Another from USW a couple of weeks later mapped changes in cerebrovascular function across a season and found a direct link to the number of “contact events”. And these are just within a given season. Further studies are in the offing, comparing the starting point of the brains of collision athletes in off-season with those in non-collision sports. Do not expect good news. Which brings us to the dread question of the number of games. Play fewer games, take fewer blows. The equation is simple. Harder to negotiate is the relationship between reducing games and keeping the sport afloat financially. There is barely an institution in rugby that is not haemorrhaging money as things are. The only way they could begin to countenance losing fixtures or increasing squad sizes would be to cut back on player pay. The irony is that the very danger to which players are exposing themselves for our entertainment makes such a policy anathema to any right-thinking observer. Watch the players’ forebears go down with terminal conditions, then dock their pay. There might be one other development more disastrous for the sport’s image, and that is for its governing bodies to take on its stricken former players in a court of law. That is the path rugby seems as set on now as it was this time a year ago. To see a graceful way out of the predicament that does not turn off more parents looking to occupy their kids on a Sunday morning is next to impossible. Because this is not about conspiracy or criminal intent. This is what happens when a collision sport goes from a part‑time amateur status to full-time professional, when players stop drinking beer and start on protein shakes, when science brings to bear all its advances to improve them, when the defining energy of a new century anyway is the lust of everyone, from schoolkid to international, to “be the best I can be”. When athletes in a collision sport pursue that blessed state, the repercussions of their increased threat to each other are deleterious. You cannot repeatedly collide with other people without repeatedly jolting your head. A year on, rugby is nowhere nearer solving this conundrum than any of the rest of them.",Sport/Sport,No fix in sight as rugby edges closer to harsh truth hardwired into collision sports | Michael Aylwin,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/dec/12/no-fix-in-sight-as-rugby-edges-closer-to-harsh-truth-hardwired-into-collision-sports
12/12/2021,"Six children, seven – it could sound like a lot to take on. But the rocket and car entrepreneur and father of six Elon Musk, says it is imperative that humankind follows his example – likewise that of Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg – and puts population maintenance first. “There are not enough people,” Musk told a US business audience last week. “I can’t emphasise this enough, there are not enough people.” He was renewing his warning that advocates of smaller families, among them Britain’s prime minister and Prince Harry, have got it wrong. Harry received an award not long ago for pledging to have no more than two children. Before that, Johnson, whose growing family is still believed to be in single figures, spotted that the “primary challenge facing our species” is people like himself. From a plane window, he wrote: “You have a horrifying vision of habitations multiplying and replicating like bacilli in a petri dish.”  But now Musk announces, in language only marginally more temperate, that the scariest thing is the opposite: “Please look at the numbers – if people don’t have more children, civilisation is going to crumble. Mark my words.” The numbers indeed show that, as in the UK, US fertility rates, already below replacement level, declined still further in 2020, by 4%. What’s less certain is that this spells disaster or, if it does, that there is anything, short of building a new Gilead, that pronatalists from Musk to Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, can do about it. Birthrate-boosting programmes conflict with those for educating girls: the more educated women are, the fewer children they have. The Social Market Foundation wondered, in a recent assessment of the UK’s “baby shortage”, if bigger families would even add to parental contentment. Although parents tend to say they’d have liked more children, “studies also suggest childbearing has a limited effect on parental happiness and life satisfaction”. At least, it’s been noted of Musk, the car magnate has followed his own reproductive advice. Asked last week if this philosophy had informed his own family size, Musk agreed that, just like our own Rees-Mogg, who reportedly hopes for a seventh, he strives, insemination-wise, to set an example. Similarly, there is no denying that the billionaire makes his domestic pronatalism sound both easy and fun, telling Maureen Dowd: “I think babies are super-cool and really people need to have more babies.” Juggling six children with running his car and space exploration businesses has never, you note, featured among the reasons for postponing SpaceX’s first crewed base on Mars. How on earth does he do it? Does he, like some of those mega-mothers you read about, complete all the week’s meal-planning and cooking on a Sunday? Leave them to cry? Follow the example of the UK’s favourite “superwoman” Helena Morrissey (when she takes over from her house husband)? In what will hopefully evolve into a Musk child-rearing manual featuring the level of detail already available on his Mars space colony (“food would be grown on solar-powered hydroponic farms”), he has shared some hints on the early years. Since, he’s concluded, babies “are just eating and pooping machines”, his (now ex-) partner, the singer Grimes, had a “much bigger role”, in looking after his sixth and her first child, a boy called X Æ A-Xii. “Right now, there’s not much I can do,” he said. “When the kid gets older, there will be more of a role for me.” On raising older ones – he has five surviving (the first died in infancy) with his first wife – Musk offers: “If I have a trip for Tesla to China, for example, I’ll bring the kids with me and we’ll go see the Great Wall or we took the bullet train from Beijing to Xi’an and saw the Terracotta Warriors.” For more on family routine we turn to a piece by Justine Wilson, a writer and the former Mrs Musk. She mentions a staff of five. “But the whirlwind of glitter couldn’t disguise a growing void at the core. Elon was obsessed with his work: when he was home, his mind was elsewhere.” In that respect, time has done little, to judge by his latest tweets, to make Musk more domesticated. Debating his lifestyle choices with the public, he offers: “It would be nice to have a bit more free time on my hands as opposed to just working day and night, from when I wake up to when I go to sleep seven days a week.” Far from undermining his population advice, Musk’s striking indifference to the implications of a scheme that will depend, as with all reproductive fantasies, on women’s biological compliance, may actually have helped. Fellow pronatalists who acknowledge, with various hero-mother inducements, the required female sacrifice in independence, earnings and influence, thereby risk, like Hungary’s Orbán, unhappy comparisons with Soviet predecessors. Glory to the mother heroine! It’s no time since Dorothy Byrne, the president of Murray Edwards College, Cambridge, was pilloried for urging female students to consider their egg supply. But by dint of ignoring the reality for the female providers if his six-kid revolution caught on, Musk won himself a respectful hearing. True, he also overlooked a few areas of interest to all would-be parents who now lack the resources to have, even, a below replacement number family. Childcare might have been a good place for a useful visionary to start. On the other hand, if he’s right about the threat posed to innovation by depopulation, it only underlines the need for more affluent altruists, such as Musk, to personally keep on breeding, recruiting whatever young women might be required to guarantee the future supply of ideas. In a difficult week for Mr and Mrs Johnson, credit is similarly due to both for their latest contribution to saving civilisation.

12/12/2021,"The slut-shaming – or something very much like it – of the four key witnesses against Ghislaine Maxwell and her late lover, Jeffrey Epstein is, almost, a thing of beauty, a dark wonder to behold. You’ve got to admire the way Maxwell’s multimillion-dollar attorneys break her accusers on the rack of their own human frailty. No one dare call it torture: we’re watching justice at work, the Ghislaine Maxwell defence team way. In order of appearance witness “Jane” was challenged as a drug user from a wealthy but deeply unhappy home; witness “Kate” was a drug user with a troubled mother; witness Carolyn – to give her some privacy the court accepted her request to use only her real first name – had a single parent mother who was an alcoholic and a drug addict, who became an alcoholic and a drug addict herself, who left school when she was 14, who did not, said her ex-boyfriend Shawn “have the reading ability” to say Ms Maxwell’s first name, Ghislaine. So Carolyn called her Maxwell. Witness Annie Farmer – her full real name, was 16, the child of a divorced single mum but not herself broken, not at all.  The ages of the women when they say Maxwell helped Epstein sexually abuse them were Jane: 14, Kate: 17, Carolyn: 14 and Annie: 16. You might say there’s a pattern of behaviour by Maxwell and Epstein right there. Carolyn said of the woman whose first name she couldn’t articulate, Ghislaine, that she booked her for sex massages with her lover and once came into the massage room in the Epstein mansion in Palm Beach and molested her: “I was fully nude and she [Ghislaine] came in and she felt my boobs and my hips and my buttocks and said that … I had a great body for Mr Epstein and his friends.” Carolyn said that she gave Epstein about 100 massages, all of them sexual, all of them ending with him masturbating. Shawn said of Carolyn, one of three girlfriends he says he pimped out to Maxwell and Epstein: “She was a child”, one who, “only had two jobs ever. She worked at Arby’s [a US fast food combine] and she worked for Jeffrey” [Epstein]. Carolyn’s grandfather raped her when she was four years old. Ten years later, she said she was sexually abused by Epstein and Maxwell. Enter a second Jeffrey, this one bearing the surname Pagliuca, one of the defence team at the Manhattan federal court trying Ghislaine Maxwell on six charges of, effectively, grooming girls and very young women to sate her millionaire lover’s paedophilia. Ghislaine Maxwell denies all six counts. Pagliuca had great sport, crushing Carolyn’s spirit so that at one point proceedings had to stop while Carolyn just uttered heart-rending sobs. Pagliuca, with his bouffant grey curly hair a spitting image for another great American, Jerry Springer, read out Carolyn’s surname by mistake. Funnily enough, he’d got previous for this, also reading out the true first name of the first female witness, “Jane”. A famous actor in a long-running Hollywood TV soap opera, Jane had told the court she feared public disgrace if she gave evidence under her own name: “I’ve always just wanted to put this past me. I moved on with my life. I work in the entertainment industry and victim shaming is still very present to this day.” So Pagliuca made the same mistake of helping anyone in court with half an eye work out the true identity of anonymised witnesses, twice. What was striking about these serial verbal mishaps is that, on song, Pagliuca is extraordinarily fluent, brutal even, when flaying the skin of a woman who left school at the age of 14. He brought up a 2007 interview Carolyn had given to the FBI, before the infamous sweetheart deal that saw Epstein serve a farcically short time in prison for being a serial paedophile. The mechanics of this are worth noting: time and again Pagliuca would rattle out the bundle number, the document number “0005”, the page, the tab, the paragraph and then stick it to Carolyn, kind of suggesting that when there was a discrepancy in her evidence, suggesting without the articulation of it, that she had been lying then or was lying now. Lost in the legal weeds, Carolyn started to retreat into her own misery, sometimes saying “I don’t recall”, sometime barking at him like a cornered animal, sometimes muttering a mute sob. Despite Pagliuca at his worst, she kept coming back at him: a wholly authentic human being. The defence case proper will start this week but it’s obvious that their strategy is to paint Maxwell as a victim of the wicked Epstein. Pagliuca noted that Carolyn had been paid $3.25m from Epstein’s estate after the paedophile’s suicide. Pagliuca prodded Carolyn if there was an “incentive for you to stick to your story” after she got her money. Carolyn shot back: “The only thing Ms Maxwell was involved in was fondling my breast and my buttocks, and for that my soul is broken and so is my heart. Money will not ever fix what that woman has done to me.” And then she was lost in grief. Not long afterwards, the prosecution put up a JP Morgan banker who set out that Maxwell had received $30m from Epstein when he was very much alive. A victim, perhaps, but a very rich one. Shortly before the trial Rachel Johnson revealed how at Oxford she once saw “shiny Glamazon” Ghislaine Maxwell resting her “high-heeled boot” and fixing her “naughty eyes” on her brother Boris, now prime minister. Rachel concluded that it was “hard not to pity” Ghislaine. I feel twice-sorry for Ghislaine Maxwell: first, because her father Robert was a monster; second, because the conditions in the jail in which she is being held on remand are grim beyond belief. But watching how her defence lawyers earn their big money, how they use their wits to trash sad and broken women, my pity for Ghislaine Maxwell shrivels with every passing day. The trial continues. John Sweeney is the host of two podcasts, Hunting Ghislaine, and Hunting Ghislaine, The Trial. His book, also called Hunting Ghislaine, will be published next year.",News/US news,"It’s tough to see Ghislaine Maxwell’s team toy with such sad, broken women  | John Sweeney",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/12/ghislaine-maxwell-jeffrey-epstein-lawyers-court-case-broken-women
12/12/2021,"The citizens of Margate, wrote TS Eliot, were “humble people who expect nothing”. That seems to include their expectations of prime minister Boris Johnson. After weeks of revelations about lockdown Christmas parties, accusations of lying about his Downing Street flat refurbishment, and claims that he ordered dogs and cats to be given priority in the Afghanistan evacuation, Johnson’s popularity has slumped in the polls.  Yet this seaside town is surely where he can rely on support. Voters in the constituencies of North Thanet and South Thanet were solidly in favour of leaving the European Union in 2016, and gave the two Tory MPs, Sir Roger Gale and Craig Mackinlay, substantial majorities in 2019. The icy wind ripping across Margate sands may be coming for the prime minister though. His supporters seem unbothered by the latest scandals, but some of those who voted for Brexit and the Conservatives now believe Johnson is unfit to govern. In the old town, John Greves uses an expletive to describe Johnson. “He’s a very, very clever man but I’m sad to say he’s absolutely clueless,” he says. Greves, a local businessman, has raised funds for the local Conservative party and been involved in local politics for some time. He is pleased that Brexit happened and believes that “you need Tories to make the money and socialists to tell you how to spend the profits”. He worries that people seem not to care about each other any more. Christmas parties and wallpaper are irrelevant, he believes, but he is hugely frustrated by Johnson. “He needs to walk,” he says. “He is incapable of representing this country. He got into No 10 on the back of getting Brexit done. He’s in No 10, he got Brexit done, and now he’s there, he’s found out that he doesn’t want to be there.” Past the Turner Contemporary gallery, the beach is almost entirely deserted. Inside a Wetherspoons pub on the seafront, Mike Simmons is relaxing with a lunchtime pint and a copy of the Telegraph. He turns 77 in a few weeks and dismisses talk of Christmas parties and wallpaper, although he is unhappy about the allegation that animals were prioritised over people during the evacuation of Kabul. “I put a lot of it down to the wife – she’s got too much influence,” he says, referring to Carrie Johnson. “My son-in-law has been in Bosnia and Iraq – I love dogs but people have got to come first.” Gale described the No 10 party as “another Barnard Castle moment”, but Simmons thinks the prime minister’s problem has been his inability to handle advisers like Dominic Cummings. “OK, that idiot should have gone to Specsavers instead of driving to wherever it was, but anyone in their right mind would have kept him under control. And Johnson’s future? “I can’t see him lasting the next two years if he carries on like he has done. But who’s going to take his place? I don’t think Dominic Raab is up to it. [Michael] Gove is brilliant, but he’s like poison.” Alan Hatton hasn’t voted in recent elections, although he was previously a Tory voter who backed Tony Blair and thought Jeremy Corbyn’s nationalisation plans were sound. Here is the most solid support for Johnson so far. “I couldn’t care less about the wallpaper,” he says. “I can’t understand why he couldn’t get a government payment to redecorate Downing Street. Most politicians aren’t that well paid.” He’s happy to look past the Christmas party as well. “It could have been an impromptu party. No one obeyed the Covid rules to the letter. He got Brexit done. I don’t know why he’s being lambasted now. He just needs to get people jobs.” On the high street, there is further support for Johnson. “It’s a year old,” says Roger Newton, when the Christmas parties are mentioned. “Downing Street is his home. I don’t think we should be poking around in there.” He is generally pleased with the handling of the pandemic and the latest announcements about moving to “plan B” measures on Covid, as well as the government’s general direction. He balks at the No 10 flat refurbishments. “That is a bit of a dodgy situation,” he says. “They had given him £30,000. You would have thought that would be enough. But I think the working-class people probably like him. Even if he is a bit of a loose cannon.” It’s not hard to also find people in Margate who express loathing for the prime minister. Mike Kerslake says Johnson has “sent the reputation of the country into the gutter”, while Carol Hudd, a retired teacher, adopts Keir Starmer’s “trivial person” description. Yet if the Labour leader hopes those sentiments will translate into votes, he may struggle. Lynne Jardine doesn’t vote, she says, and is fatalistic about the Christmas parties. “It’s no surprise” she says. “Last Christmas, I got Covid and I had to spend a week on my own. I just slept most of the time.” Things have got much worse for her though. Her 17-year-old son broke his back after falling off a cliff and is paralysed. They have a wheelchair that is not appropriate and will have to wait two years for the local authority to adapt their rented home. The money spent on Downing Street is “disgusting”, she says. “We don’t get any help.” Her anger is not limited to the governing party, though. “None of them deliver what they promise. They all lie.”",News/Politics,‘He’s clueless’: faith in Boris Johnson wavers in Tory stronghold Margate,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/12/hes-clueless-faith-in-boris-johnson-wavers-in-tory-stronghold-margate
12/12/2021,"I’m uneasy. After an autumn defined by the prime minister’s lies and evasions, voters in the North Shropshire byelection this Thursday should and must send a decisive message that enough is enough. That the careless lack of integrity and honesty that are the hallmarks of his government, culminating in taking the public for fools in denying the existence of a Christmas party that plainly was, are degrading politics and with it the functioning of the British state. But will they? The bookmakers certainly make the Lib Dems favourites to take the seat. A leaked internal Lib Dem postal poll taken before the extraordinary events of the past week put their candidate just 10 points behind the Tory frontrunner. Now the margin must be closer.  The Lib Dems are surely the challenger. Indeed, there was an informal understanding between the Labour and Lib Dem leaderships that just as the Lib Dems would not campaign actively in Old Bexley and Sidcup, giving Labour a free run, so Labour would return the favour in North Shropshire. Every shadow cabinet minister was required not to campaign in the seat: none has. First-past-the-post voting imposes tough choices. Every Labour and Green voter must put aside their prime party affiliation and back the Lib Dem candidate while those decent Tories who can’t bring themselves to vote for a non-Tory might consider staying away from the polls . What was done at the Chesham and Amersham byelection in June, where the Labour candidate received just 622 votes, must be repeated. Imagine what it would have felt like, had the contest been tighter, to have been one of those 622, waking up to realise you had the chance to send a crucial signal – but blew it. (In the end, in Chesham and Amersham, the Lib Dems won by a handsome margin.) Yet despite the bookmakers’ odds, Chesham and Amersham may not be repeated. North Shropshire is pro-Brexit and a Tory citadel, a rural constituency where vestigial semi-feudalism and social deference give succour to Toryism. There, to be Conservative is somehow non-political, part of the natural English order of things. The system of lord lieutenants, an office established by Henry VIII as the monarch’s representative in every county, lives on, its holders typically Conservative, even if undeclared. But their countywide good works serve to lift Toryism out of party politics. Thus Shropshire’s lord lieutenancy office has a typical roll call of the county’s great and good – squires, retired military, local business people, the landed – cementing the county into the Tory camp. With no major towns, industry or universities in the constituency to provide balance, it is an inestimable electoral asset; nobody, despite the pantomime in No 10, can be certain which way it will now jump. The catalytic influence will be the reports that Christopher Geidt, the Queen’s former private secretary, now the prime minister’s adviser on ethics and standards, is considering resigning because Johnson lied to him when he said he did not know when and who was funding the refurbishment of his Downing Street flat. If monarchist, “non-political” Geidt goes early this week, it will be decisive. It will be a signal to Tory England that one of their best allies considers their leader an inveterate liar. Johnson’s career as PM will be over. Who with any standing or self-respect could succeed Geidt? Here, although it will stick in many Labour activists’ craw, is the crucial social role played by the Lib Dems. They, too, can enjoy in some places a standing as somehow “non-political”, notwithstanding their political leanings. This explains why they are a crucial part of any progressive alliance. They will be the beneficiaries in North Shropshire of Tory disintegration, as they would be in other parts of rural England in a general election. Their 12 MPs could easily rise to over 50 – if there is intelligent tactical voting. In the 1997 general election, tactical voting was worth up to 30 seats; as the then Observer editor, I spent a large part of the annual promotional budget on a poll of 20 marginals to support just that aim. All the seats fell to Labour or the Lib Dems. It was also in that election that Michael Portillo, then defence secretary, unexpectedly lost the hitherto safe Enfield Southgate seat. In 2019, there was not much evidence of tactical voting; the “non-political” were not going to play any part in putting Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street. Sir Keir Starmer may be criticised by the left for his moderation and caution; in a first-past-the-post voting system it is a crucial asset in emboldening tactical voting. The open question is how to encourage what is a strategic necessity; the chance of Labour winning 125 seats to form a government demands an impossible swing. There will have to be Lib Dem gains and an agreement that the party will support a Labour-led government. Everyone knows this truth – not acknowledging it holds more risk than evading it. The shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, was only floored, in an otherwise devastating attack on the government on the Today programme, when he was asked if he would support tactical voting in North Shropshire. The stock reply – the electorate don’t want party fixes but clear choices – is nonsense with first past the post. Indeed, to endorse first past the post is to legitimise one of the chief building blocks of Tory England’s grip on government: it is the glue that holds the party together and, given the opposition vote splitting, confers continual electoral ascendancy. Openly to admit what is now being done privately would instead give a new seriousness of purpose to British politics and allow opposition politicians not to dodge the obvious question that tripped up Streeting. If the voters of North Shropshire have a sacred duty not to vote Tory this Thursday, Starmer and Ed Davey have a parallel responsibility. British capitalism, society and democracy need a fundamental reset, as does our broken relationship with Europe. None of this is going to come from Johnson or the amoral party that indulged him. It requires a broad-based progressive government. Tactical voting must step out of the shadows: it is time for it to be formalised in a transparent public pact. The times demand no less.

12/12/2021,"While Downing Street spent a disastrous week attempting to deal with scandals over parties and wallpaper – and the prime minister was juggling the crises with the birth of a daughter – things were somewhat more serene for another member of his top team. Rather than dealing with resignations among staff or the latest revelations about Whitehall Christmas parties, foreign secretary Liz Truss has spent the weekend boosting her credentials as a stateswoman, using a meeting of her international counterparts in Liverpool to pitch herself as one of those protecting “the frontiers of freedom” around the world.  Her high-profile outing at the G7 meeting comes after a week that could scarcely have contrasted more starkly with the chaos engulfing No 10. The gathering came after a bilateral meeting with US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and a major speech appealing to the Tory base, appealing for a “confident, outward-looking, patriotic and positive” Britain. And Christmas parties? “Last Christmas, I was spending time getting trade deals over the line,” she said. Combined with pictures of the foreign secretary channelling Margaret Thatcher, pictured aboard a British tank in Estonia, it is little surprise that Tory MPs suggest Truss is now firmly and deliberately established as a leading contender to succeed Johnson, especially if his premiership should last months rather than years. Her prominence is already causing tension among supporters of the chancellor, Rishi Sunak – the other pre-eminent candidate to replace the prime minister. Allies of Sunak have long been suspicious of No 10’s treatment of Truss, suspecting that she was set up as a rival to the chancellor in order to clip his wings. “Clearly she plans to bash her way to final two [in a leadership contest] then allow a Trumpian base to carry her into No 10,” said one. “God help us!” Tories said Sunak had adopted a different tactic while the government was on the ropes – to hunker down. The other obvious leadership contender is Jeremy Hunt, who came a distant second to Johnson in the last leadership contest. He is said by colleagues never to have relinquished his ambitions and has maintained the good relations he built up with MPs during his last campaign. He has won further support through his handling of the health select committee, but some believe his long time as health secretary could leave him open to criticism. “Any form of pandemic scenario planning was non-existent,” said one MP who supported Hunt last time. “That could be something that others can beat him over the head about.” Other previous big hitters suddenly look less likely to run. Sajid Javid, who at one time seemed the obvious replacement for Johnson’s predecessor Theresa May, is not said to be particularly active. Then there is Michael Gove, who destroyed Johnson’s first leadership campaign in the wake of the Brexit vote before imploding in another attempt in 2019, after it emerged he had taken cocaine in his journalism years. Asked last week whether Gove was the answer, his former adviser Dominic Cummings – who went on to serve Johnson as the prime minister’s chief adviser – replied simply: “No.” Cummings has previously spared Sunak from criticism over Covid. He said on his blog that he had thoughts about the future leadership, but that it would not be helpful if he expressed any views now. There are outsiders that Tory MPs believe could throw their hats into the ring. One is Mark Harper, the former chief whip who has built a reputation with lockdown sceptics as a leading voice in the Covid Recovery Group. He ran when May was toppled in 2019 and could manage to gather enough support to make a dent in the race. “Never confuse electability with people’s self-belief,” said one Tory MP. “Who might say ‘Oh, you know, I’ve carved out a bit of a reputation’? Mark Harper might throw his hat in the ring again. He could play the liberty and common sense card, which plays well with some.” It all leaves Keir Starmer’s team with an interesting dilemma. Would Labour rather fight Johnson at the next election, wounded but with a winning track record with the electorate, or a new, untested opponent without his baggage? Some Tories said that despite winning in 2019, Johnson was now the easier opponent for Labour. “Starmer must be praying that Johnson stays where he is,” said a senior MP. “There’s no other burlesque clown figure who could take over. Whoever takes over is going to be more sober, serious-looking and sounding like a prime minister. And you take away at a stroke Keir’s USP, which is: ‘I look like a prime minister and I’m not chaotic.’”",News/Politics,Liz Truss plays stateswoman as Tory leadership contenders line up for battle,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/12/liz-truss-plays-stateswoman-as-tory-leadership-contenders-line-up-for-battle
