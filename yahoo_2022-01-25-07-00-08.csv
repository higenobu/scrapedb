1/25/2022,"Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers is very good at football. He’s probably going to be named the NFL’s MVP in a few weeks, an award he also won last year, and in 2014, and in 2011. This year’s been a little different, though, as his play on the field hasn’t been near as big of a story as his judgement off of it. Rodgers has for months now been pushing conspiracy theories, about Covid-19 and, most recently, the 2020 election. Team Trump is impressed. Liz Harrington, the former president’s spokesperson, used comments Rodgers made last week to push the lie that the 2020 election was illegitimate during a Monday appearance on Steve Bannon’s podcast. More from Rolling Stone NFL Fines Aaron Rodgers, Green Bay Packers for Covid-19 Protocol Violations Howard Stern on Aaron Rodgers: 'They Should Throw Him Out of the League So Fast' 'SNL' Mocks Aaron Rodgers' Disastrous Interview in Cold Open Sketch “The only good news is the American people know it,” Harrington said of the false idea that the election was rigged. “I mean, you had four years of them saying the 2016 election was stolen by Russia and you never had quarterbacks questioning President Trump’s legitimacy. You’ve got Aaron Rodgers just flat out calling it out and saying, ’81 million votes? Yeah, I guess. But it doesn’t certainly look like it.'” It’s unclear which other quarterbacks are questioning the legitimacy of the election, if any are, but longtime Trump crush Tom Brady isn’t one of them. Brady mocked Trump’s election fraud claims while visiting President Biden at the White House following the Buccaneers’ Super Bowl win last year. He declined to even show up to Trump’s White House after the Patriots won Super Bowls in 2017 and 2019 (his absence was part of a team-wide boycott in 2019). Trump’s Team seems thrilled there’s a new Hall of Fame-caliber quarterback they can claim as their own. Harrington’s nod to Rodgers was in reference to comments he made in a piece published Friday by ESPN. “When the president of the United States says, ‘This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated,’ it’s because him and his constituents, which, I don’t know how there are any if you watch any of his attempts at public speaking, but I guess he got 81 million votes,” he said. “But when you say stuff like that, and then you have the CDC, which, how do you even trust them, but then they come out and talk about 75% of the COVID deaths have at least four comorbidities. And you still have this fake White House set saying that this is the pandemic of the unvaccinated, that’s not helping the conversation.” The statistic Rodgers seems to be citing here comes from a Centers for Disease Control study which found that in a group of 1.2 million people who were fully vaccinated between Oct. 2020 and Dec. 2021, 36 died and of those 36, 78 percent had at least four comorbidities. Rodgers mischaracterizing Covid data is what prompted the ESPN piece — generously tilted “The unfiltered year of Aaron Rodgers” — in the first place. The quarterback ruffled feathers by bashing the Packers before the season started, but his penchant for controversy transcended sports when he outed himself as an anti-vaxxer during a November appearance on The Pat McAfee Show. Fresh off testing positive for Covid, Rodgers cycled through a laundry list of MAGA talking points, whining that he’s in the “crosshairs of the woke mob,” praising Joe Rogan, and even quoting Martin Luther King, Jr. “You have a moral obligation to object to unjust rules,” he said from his couch. Rodgers added that he’s doing his “own research” about the virus, which is anti-vaxxer code for treating the word of quack doctors and conspiracy theorists as gospel while ignoring or mischaracterizing the work of infectious disease experts. It’s difficult to merely dabble in the world of conspiracy, where the slopes are slippery, and Rodgers is now casting doubt on the legitimacy of the election because he doesn’t think President Biden is a good public speaker — or, more likely, because he saw someone else make the same case. Harrington’s comments are ironic considering the extent to which right-wing media has bashed athletes for speaking out about political issues. Trump has done so plenty, most notably in regard to NFL players who have kneeled in protest of racial injustice during the national anthem. “They’re all saying: ‘Oh, it has nothing to do with the flag. It’s the way we’ve been treated,’” Trump told Fox News in 2018. “In the meantime, they’re making $15 million a year. Look, I’m all for the athletes. I think it’s great. I love athletics. I love sports. But they shouldn’t get the politics involved.” Best of Rolling Stone The Useful Idiots New Guide to the Most Stoned Moments of the 2020 Presidential Campaign Anatomy of a Fake News Scandal The Radical Crusade of Mike Pence",Politics/Rolling Stone,Move Over MyPillow Guy: Aaron Rodgers Is Trumpworld’s Hot New Election Conspiracy Theorist,https://news.yahoo.com/move-over-mypillow-guy-aaron-185650833.html
1/25/2022,"Stock markets tumbled last week on fears about rising interest rates and inflation. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index fell 8% last week and is down 13% this year. The world's five richest tech tycoons have collectively lost about $85 billion in 2022. Sign up here for our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell The world's five richest tech tycoons have collectively lost about $85 billion of their wealth in the first few weeks of 2022, with their fortunes taking an especially big hit from last week's market sell-off. The losses sent the fortune of the world's richest person, Elon Musk, down to an estimated $243 billion — some $27 billion lower than at the start of the year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. It's also nearly $100 billion lower than November, when Musk's net worth peaked at $335 billion. The world's second-richest person, Amazon's founder, Jeff Bezos, has lost about $25 billion in 2022. The Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates has seen a $9.5 billion drop in his net worth since January 1, per the Bloomberg index, while the Google cofounder Larry Page's net worth has decreased by $12 billion. Rounding out the losses is Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, whose net worth has also dropped by about $12 billion this year. All five saw losses in their tech stock holdings. Last week, the benchmark tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell about 8% on the back of several concerns including rising interest rates and inflation. The Nasdaq is down about 13% this year. According to Bloomberg, the only one of the world's five wealthiest people who didn't lose money last week was Bernard Arnault, the chairman and CEO of the French luxury giant LVMH. Even so, Arnault's wealth is down $10.5 billion this year, with LVMH share prices down 5% amid a broader market rout.

1/25/2022,"CHAMPLAIN, N.Y. (AP) — Whenever a bus arrives at the Greyhound station in Plattsburgh, New York, a small band of taxi drivers waits to drive passengers on a half-hour trip to a snowy, dead-end dirt road. There, at the border with Canada, refugees pile out of taxis or vans several times a day, and Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers warn that they will be arrested for illegal entry if they cross, which they do. Most are soon released to pursue asylum, living and working freely while awaiting a decision. “We have the hopes of everyone — be successful and have a change of life,” Alejandro Cortez, a 25-year-old Colombian man, said as he exited a taxi last week at the end of Roxham Road in Champlain, New York. The town of about 6,000 is directly across the border from Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle, Quebec. Cortez joins a renewed stream of migrants seeking refuge in Canada after a 20-month ban on asylum requests designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Families are once again lugging suitcases and carrying children across a remote, snow-covered ditch to the border. Canada’s decision to lift the ban on Nov. 21 stands in marked contrast to the approach in the United States, where the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has extended indefinitely a similar restriction on the border with Mexico that will enter its third year in March. On Wednesday, a Justice Department attorney vigorously defended the ban against sharp questioning from federal appeals court judges about the scientific basis for such a far-reaching move against asylum. The U.S. expelled migrants nearly 1.5 million times from March 2020 through November under what is known as Title 42 authority, named for a 1944 public health law that the Trump and Biden administrations have used to deny migrants a chance to seek asylum on grounds that it will curb the spread of the coronavirus. That accounts for about two of three arrests or expulsions at the border, most involving single adults and some families. Unaccompanied children have been exempt under President Joe Biden. Fully vaccinated travelers have been able to enter the U.S. and Canada since November, but Canada went a step farther by reinstating a path to asylum. Cortez arrived in the United States on a tourist visa five months ago. He said he couldn’t go back to Colombia because of violence and the disappearance of thousands of young men. “All of that hurts a lot,” he said. “We have to run from our country.” Asylum-seekers on the Canadian border began appearing at Roxham Road around the time Trump became president. How it became the favored place to cross into Canada isn't clear, but the migrants are taking advantage of a quirk in a 2002 agreement between the U.S. and Canada that says people seeking asylum must apply in the first country they arrive in. Migrants who go to an official crossing — like the one where Interstate 87 ends just east of Roxham Road — are returned to the United States and told to apply there. But those who arrive in Canada at a location other than a port of entry, like Roxham Road, are allowed to stay and request protection. Nearly 60,000 people sought asylum after illegally crossing the border into Canada from February 2017 through September, many at Roxham Road, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of Montreal, Canadian government statistics  show. Of those, more than 45,000 claims have been finalized, with almost 24,300 approved, or almost 54%. Another 17,000 claims were rejected while over 14,000 are still pending. Other claims were abandoned or withdrawn. In December, the number of asylum-seekers at the border in Quebec jumped to nearly 2,800. That's up from 832 in November and 96 in October, according to the statistics. Canada lifted the asylum ban with little fanfare or public backlash, perhaps because the numbers are small compared with people crossing into the U.S. from Mexico. Biden's decision to keep the Trump-era ban in place has come under scathing criticism  from the United Nations refugee agency, legal scholars and advocates. Under the ban, people from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, are bounced back to Mexico before being afforded rights under U.S. and international law to seek asylum. People from other countries are flown home without a chance at asylum. Scientific arguments for Title 42 have met with skepticism from the start. The Associated Press reported in 2020 that Vice President Mike Pence called CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield in March of that year and told him to use the agency’s special legal authority to slash the number of asylum-seekers allowed into the country. Pence made the request after a top agency doctor who oversees such orders refused to comply with the directive, saying there was no valid public health reason to issue it. Dr. Anne Schuchat, the second-highest CDC official when she departed in May, told a congressional panel last year that “the bulk of the evidence at that time did not support this policy proposal.” On Wednesday, Justice Department attorney Sharon Swingle insisted the ban is based on scientific expertise and prevents disease at crowded Border Patrol holding facilities. Facing persistent questioning from judges on a three-member panel in Washington, she acknowledged there were no affidavits in court records to explain the order’s scientific foundation. Within hours of the November change by the Canadian government, immigrants started arriving in large numbers at Roxham Road, said Janet McFetridge, of Plattsburg Cares, a group that provides hats, mittens and scarves to people crossing the border in the dead of winter. She said people are eager to cross while they can.  “There definitely is a fear that it's going to close suddenly,” she said while waiting on Roxham Road for the next group of migrants. A Canadian officer said in French to a woman and her traveling companion, who was carrying a baby, that it was illegal to enter Canada there. “If you cross here, you will be arrested,"" he said. ""Yes, it's not a problem. It's not a problem,"" the woman said as her companion started to pull a suitcase across the border.  ___ Spagat reported from San Diego.",World/Associated Press,More migrants seek asylum through reopened Canadian border,https://news.yahoo.com/more-migrants-seek-asylum-reopened-162010735.html
