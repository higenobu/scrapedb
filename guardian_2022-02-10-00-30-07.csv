2/10/2022,"Rosemonde Bertin was only 17 when British officials arrived on Salomon Atoll in 1972. Everyone was ordered to gather at the manager’s office on the coconut plantation. She does not remember any advance warning. The commissioner of the British Indian Ocean territory (BIOT) told them they had to leave their homes because Americans were coming to the Chagos archipelago to set up a military base.  For Bertin, who used to clean the house of the plantation manager, Mr Doffay, and look after a baby, it was the moment her island life vanished forever. “It had been wonderful,” she said. “There were about 300 people and we lived as one big family.” On Wednesday, 50 years later, the 67-year-old was below deck in her pitching cabin reminiscing about her youth and heading back on a Mauritian-chartered vessel towards Salomon Atoll. By the weekend she should be able to set foot on her homeland once more. In the early 1970s, the islanders survived by fishing and working on the plantation; regular boats to Mauritius had stopped years earlier. “The authorities put pressure on people to say that we needed to go or otherwise we wouldn’t survive,” she said. “The provisions in the store on the island had been run down. There was only one bag of sugar. I can’t understand how someone who lived freely could be removed by these officials.” All the Salomon islanders were taken onboard a transport ship, the Nordvaer, chartered by the British government. Half of them were taken to Mauritius, half to a neighbouring island, Peros Banhos. Reports at the time recorded that the islanders’ pets were killed after they left. “I felt very sad, without knowing where I was going,” Bertin said. “There were no cabins on the boat. They put mattresses on the decks. It was in a very bad state: the vessel normally carried animals and guano – fertiliser for the plantations. Conditions were so bad one lady gave birth prematurely.” Bertin has lived in Mauritius ever since. She has been permitted “heritage” return visits twice before, in 2006 and 2009, under the close supervision of UK officials. Now she is delighted to be going home unmonitored. “I can’t accept being a visitor,” she said. “I’m a native.” Lisbey Elyse was 20 when she was taken off Peros Banhos in 1973. Now 73, she is also onboard the Bleu De Nîmes, the former British minesweeper chartered by the Mauritian government that is heading to the Chagos Islands for a marine survey. “Life was lovely. We ate what we grew. There was fish and fresh fruit,” she said. “We had a garden and cultivated tomatoes, aubergine, pumpkins and lettuce.” She worked on the plantation until “two men turned up, the commissioner and a director of the company. They said we couldn’t stay and that we would all be removed from the island and taken to Mauritius. They told us we would have houses and gardens there just like we had on Peros Banhos.” That promise never materialised, she said. “I felt very sad, heartbroken. There was no choice about leaving. I’m so proud of being from Chagos. I want to go back and live there again. It was paradise. There used to be 1,200 people on my island.” Ownership of the islands is disputed. A UN tribunal has ruled that the UK should hand the archipelago back to Mauritius. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) says the decision was only advisory. Responding to the Mauritian expedition, which will measure reefs in the Chagos Islands, the FCDO adopted a conciliatory tone, saying: “Mauritius notified the UK about its plans to conduct a scientific survey close to the Chagos Islands. The UK shares this interest in environmental protection and gave assurances to Mauritius that it would not interrupt the survey.” It did not restate the UK’s assertion of sovereignty. Chagossian Voices, an organisation representing some of the exiled Chagossian community who live in the UK, was more critical of the Mauritian government initiative. “This is an obscenely expensive vanity expedition carried out without proper consultation with the Chagossian community,” read a statement from the group. “Many Chagossians are appalled that such a huge sum of money can be spent at a time of economic crisis and when Chagossians remain on the margins of Mauritian society. Chagossians are filled with dread at the prospect of the islands being handed to Mauritius.” Henry Smith, the Conservative MP for Crawley, where most of the Chagossian community in the UK live, told the Daily Telegraph: “This is clearly a political statement by the Mauritian government with regards to its claims on the Chagos and nothing to do with conservation.” The Mauritian government has not said the voyage is about environmental matters: it was convened to carry out measurements in relation to claims to the seabed. During the day, the Mauritian ambassador Jagdish Koonjul, who is also on the Bleu De Nîmes, raised his country’s flag on a yardarm. Amid heavy rain and with a following wind, the ship was steaming due east towards the Chagos Islands, rolling gently in moderate seas.",News/World news,‘Life was lovely’: Chagossian women head home 50 years after forced exile,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/09/chagos-islanders-head-home-50-years-after-exile
2/10/2022,"Any movie star can put their face to a product. It’s the easiest thing in the world to do; you have a recognisable face, and people want to give you money for putting that face next to something they’re trying to sell. However, very few celebrities are good at endorsing products that fit with their own personal brand. Do you think that Kevin Bacon is really that interested in mobile data coverage? Of course not. And nobody would assume that George Clooney – handsome billionaire actor George Clooney – spends his whole day making coffee from little plastic pods. So when true synergy reveals itself, when a celebrity finally uncovers that one brand that fits so neatly with their persona that the two become indistinguishable, we have to applaud.  I’m telling you this because Stanley Tucci has just announced a “multi-year collaboration” with San Pellegrino. Isn’t that beautiful? Isn’t that the most perfect thing you’ve ever heard? Tucci, the actor, producer and impeccably dressed cookery and cocktails lockdown heart-throb, is now for ever joined at the hip with a company selling expensive water. The two mesh so well, don’t they? Try to imagine Tucci in a restaurant asking for a jug of tap water. You can’t, can you? Even if you close your eyes and strain as hard as you can, you cannot summon the mental image of pristine man about town Stanley Tucci asking a waiter to give him something for free. No, Tucci wants to pay for his water. He wants to pay over the odds for his water. He wants to pay over the odds for a water that isn’t as nice as flat water, but carries slightly more prestige. This is who Stanley Tucci is, and everybody knows it. Sure, the collaboration will involve a television advertising campaign, probably where Tucci wanders around an idyllic spot in northern Italy, being charming in a well-fitting polo shirt and occasionally running his hands through a pile of lemons as he closes his eyes in ecstasy. That goes without saying. But what pushes this into extra special territory is this: San sounds a bit like Stan. And Stan is the first half of Stanley. You’re there already, aren’t you? That’s right, S.Pellegrino has temporarily rebranded as Stan Pellegrino, and there is apparently a competition to win a branded Stan Pellegrino bottle that has been engraved with Tucci’s signature. True, it won’t be for everyone. But people who like water, Stanley Tucci, puns and being wildly optimistic about the resale value of empty bottles that come with an incomprehensible scrawl scratched on them would do well to enter. But in the longer term, this is the sort of brand partnership to which celebrities should aspire. It isn’t enough to just plonk your face on an advert. Nor, sadly, is it enough to partner with the sort of brand that the public assumes you use. No. Now there needs to be a pun in it, too. We’re talking Meryl Streep advertising an expensive knitwear company and temporarily changing her name to Meryl Sheep. We’re talking Ryan Gosling endorsing a luxury lightweight hammock brand and appearing in adverts as Ryan Gauze Sling. We’re talking Emma Stone becoming the public face of stones and keeping her name exactly as it is. This is how things should only be from now on.

2/10/2022,"Samsung’s latest Android combines its Galaxy S and Note into one stylus-equipped superphone, which leads a new line of top-end S22 smartphones part-made from recycled plastic and fishing nets. Announced on Wednesday as part of its Unpacked livestreaming event, the Galaxy S22 Ultra combines the superzoom camera of last year’s top S21 with the body, form and features of Samsung’s popular Note phablet series, which has not been updated since 2020.  The S22 Ultra is joined by two smaller and cheaper models, the S22 and S22+. All three new devices have faster chips, the latest Android 12 and ultrasonic fingerprint scanners under their 120Hz OLED screens. But they are also more robust, with a new, harder version of Corning’s Gorilla Glass Victus+, stronger aluminium frames and internal components made of 20% recycled fishing nets or 20% recycled water bottles and CD cases. The largest of Samsung’s non-folding phones for 2022 has a brighter 6.8in QHD+ screen that curves at the edges, with a design that strongly resembles the company’s Note 20 Ultra. The phone has a large battery and a slot to store and charge its S Pen stylus, which has reduced latency, better handwriting recognition and advanced features taken straight from the Note line. The improved quadruple camera has a slimmer profile on the back, but maintains separate 3x and 10x optical zooms, which continue to set Samsung’s top models apart from rivals. This year the camera has significantly improved light sensitivity, with much larger pixels for better, sharper shots at night and in tricky lighting conditions. “The Galaxy S22 Ultra is arguably a Galaxy Note device by another name and will be greeted with delight by the legion of Note device enthusiasts, who have proved to be a loyal niche audience for Samsung, but may leave traditional Galaxy S customers scratching their heads wondering why they need a stylus,” said Ben Wood, the chief analyst at CCS Insight. The S22 and S22+ have 6.1in and 6.6in FHD+ screens respectively, making them Samsung’s smaller, cheaper and more manageable top devices. Only the S22+ has the same brighter display technology as the Ultra, but otherwise their specifications are similar to Samsung’s premium model. Both phones have a triple camera on the back with a 3x optical zoom similar to last year, and a flat glass and aluminium design. “The S22+ might actually be the star of the show this year,” said Wood. “For customers who don’t see the utility in having S Pen capability, the natural device of choice will be the S22+, which looks like a cracking product.” Alongside the new S22 phones, Samsung also unveiled a new line of tablet computers. Each of the new Galaxy Tab S8 devices has Android 12, the latest chips, optional 5G and the S Pen stylus included in the box. The Tab S8 and S8+ have 11in and 12.4in screens respectively, but it is the new S8 Ultra that stands out with its big 14.6in display, making it Samsung’s largest tablet yet. The machines are designed for entertainment, with high-resolution screens and four Dolby Atmos speakers, but also productivity, with a range of keyboard case accessories and Samsung’s DeX software that turns the tablet into a laptop-like experience.",News/Technology,Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra: stylus-equipped Android superphone launched,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/09/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-stylus-equipped-android-superphone-launched
2/10/2022,"When I moved to the UK nearly a decade ago, the City of London was one of the first places I visited. I joined a Jack the Ripper tourist walking tour on a Sunday, and I was really struck by how empty it was. All the shops and restaurants were closed, and just a few people were walking in the streets. It was shocking that one of the economic centres of the UK, one of the most powerful financial districts in the world and the site of such immense wealth, felt so totally dead. The word I always use to describe it is uncanny. Here is a place that hums with economic activity, but there were almost no people. It’s a symbol of accumulation but without any real subjects. Who is driving this rush to accumulate ever greater wealth? Who is benefiting from it? And to what end? I’ve always been a local photographer. I take inspiration from the social life of the communities I’ve lived in, but here, in the City of London, it just felt like there wasn’t one. I decided to take a series of pictures of the empty streets, to capture the strange ghostly place that I had encountered that Sunday. However I soon discovered that I could take similar images during weekdays but with solitary lonely city workers in the cityscapes, which gave the images a whole extra dimension.  This shot was part of a wider series about burnout and the psychological fallout of today’s culture of work. The series often depicts people in moments of isolation – stepping out of the office for a cigarette, walking alone through the towering buildings, or staring into their phones. This image encapsulates all of that: a lone figure, overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the office buildings surrounding her. It’s an image of the human swamped by the world we have built. What I like about this image is that it’s both specific and general. On the one hand, it could be taken in any metropolis. It captures the way that globalisation has flattened different cultures, creating these identical spaces around the world. But on the other it speaks specifically to the architecture of the City of London and the feelings that its built environment evokes. This image is as much about the architecture as the person. I was completely fascinated walking through the City by the kind of friction between the buildings. Historically, its centre was always St Paul’s – this great symbol of the church’s power, overseeing everything around it. But now the cathedral vies for domination with the office blocks that cover the area. It’s like the built environment is locked in a power struggle, with Christianity and neoliberalism competing for dominion. Working life today is very different from what it used to be. But even before Covid and the rise of working from home, workers were increasingly alone and isolated in a way they were not in the 1970s, for example. There is much less interaction, and lots of the old methods of bringing workers into dialogue with each other – such as unions – have fallen on hard times. The series preceded the pandemic, but looking back on it now it does feel a little prophetic, and I think people probably respond differently to these images now than they used to, before we were all confined to our homes. We may have become more used to seeing our cities empty, but the process started long before Covid, and will continue after it. I see my photography as explicitly political, as a tool for social change. The photographers I’m most interested in use the camera to examine and critique the societies we live in. Today, everyone takes photographs. In many ways, that’s a great thing: it’s the democratisation of the medium. But it means that photographers need to distinguish themselves. Simply capturing moments is not enough. The work of the photographer, I think, is to be reflexive and, above all, critical.

2/10/2022,"Starbucks has fired seven workers involved in organising a union in Tennessee, fueling accusations that the coffee giant is retaliating against the growing labor movement it faces nationwide. The workers – a third of the total workforce at the Memphis location – were fired on Tuesday, including most of the union organising committee.  Starbucks Workers United (SWU), the union helping several stores organize, accused the coffee chain of “union-busting” and selectively enforcing company policies as a “subterfuge” to fire union leaders. The firings stem from a media event last month when the employees allowed journalists into the cafe after hours as part of the public launch of their efforts to unionize. A company spokesperson has denied that the layoffs were linked to union efforts or retaliation for staff speaking to the media. Spokesman Reggie Borges told the BBC that the seven workers were fired following an internal investigation which concluded that they knowingly breached company rules that amounted to “safety and security violations”. The company’s justification has been rebuffed by the fired baristas and the union, who claim the company’s actions are an attempt to slow down momentum, which is gathering pace across the county. Buffalo, New York recently became home to the first unionised Starbucks-owned stores in the US since the 1980s. Since then, more than 50 locations of the chain have filed to hold votes on unionizing, which would enable workers to negotiate with the company as a group over pay and conditions. The efforts are part of a labor movement resurgence in the US, with low paid workers across a range of industries interested in setting up unions. SWU said that it planned to file complaints over the seven firings in Memphis with the National Labor Relations Board, which enforces US labour laws. On Twitter, SWU wrote: “Starbucks is retaliating against union leaders & supporters in Memphis for policies they’ve never consistently enforced before. This partner was fired after signing a union card in view of the security camera, not for ‘security violations.’” Starbucks is retaliating against union leaders & supporters in Memphis for policies they've never consistently enforced before. This partner was fired after signing a union card in view of the security camera, not for ""security violations."" pic.twitter.com/rOQpisX1U6 Starbucks has consistently tried to stop its workers from unionising, which it claims would be bad for workers. The company, which owns 8,000 stores across the US, argues that unions are unnecessary as it already offers benefits above and beyond the industry norms such as health insurance for part-time workers and college tuition reimbursement. According to the company, its average wage is more than $12 an hour, while half of its workforce earn more than $15 an hour – the minimum federal wage proposed by some labor groups and progressive lawmakers. It’s unclear how many workers organized in union efforts have been fired by Starbucks, but last year, the National Labor Relations Board found the coffee chain had retaliated illegally against two baristas involved in labour organising in Philadelphia. The company has appealed the ruling.",News/Business,Starbucks fires workers involved in union push as US movement gains momentum,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/09/starbucks-union-memphis-workers-fired-us-movement
2/10/2022,"The main surviving suspect on trial over the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris took the stand for the first time on Wednesday, telling a court that he had never killed or wounded anyone. Salah Abdeslam is suspected of being a member of a group of jihadists who carried out a coordinated series of bombings and shootings across the French capital that left 130 people dead and hundreds of others injured.  Called to give evidence for the first time in the nine-month trial, he said: “I did not kill anyone and I did not injure anyone. I didn’t inflict so much as a scratch on anyone. It’s important for me to say this.” The 32-year-old is suspected of planning to blow himself up in a suicide attack in Paris’s northern 18th arrondissement but backing out at the last minute. Police found an explosive vest they believe to have been his in a rubbish bin. Abdeslam told the court he decided to support Islamic State after western states carried out bombing raids in Syria. He said he had been brought up a Muslim in the religious sense but had not been aware of political or military associations with the religion until then. He said his brother and his best friend, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a Belgian-Moroccan believed to have been the “operational chief” of the attacks, had gone to Syria to fight the regime of Bashar al-Assad, but the bombings “changed everything” and prompted Islamic State to consider European targets. The lead judge, Jean-Louis Périès, asked him whether, given how many people died in the Paris attacks, it had been “reasonable” for him to think the attacks would change French politics. “Perhaps it would not make a difference,” Abdeslam replied, suggesting that the attacks were a tit-for-tat response to the killing of civilians in Syria. “What I find serious is when Mr François Hollande came here and said that if he had to go back he would do the same thing, which didn’t shock anyone here except me … I say, it’s because of him we are here today.” The judge responded: “We’re not here to judge France or the French parliament.” Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks on 13 November 2015, which began at about 9pm with the detonation of a suicide bomb at the Stade de France stadium and continued with a number of drive-by shootings and bombings at busy cafes and restaurants in the capital, and a massacre at the Bataclan concert hall. Apart from a number of outbursts at the opening of the trial last September, Abdeslam has remained silent since his arrest. On Wednesday he engaged in a verbal sparring match with Périès, telling him at one point: “Let’s take a deep breath.” Abdeslam said his support for sharia law included the idea that non-Muslims could be either freed, killed or held in slavery. “Yes, we can do this in the Qur’an,” he said. When the judge expressed astonishment and said this was not other Muslims’ view of Islam, he responded: “That is their vision of Islam. We can live our religion as we want. We are not going to change our religion to please others.” Abdeslam, a Brussels-born French national, is accused of being key to the international logistics operation bringing jihadists back to Europe from Syria, where they had been fighting. He was arrested in March 2016, after a four-month manhunt, in a shootout with Belgian police in the Brussels suburb of Molenbeek-Saint-Jean. Days after he was taken into custody, suicide bombers suspected of being part of the same terrorist cell struck at Brussels airport and the city’s Metro system, killing 32 and injuring hundreds. The marathon legal process is the biggest ever criminal trial in France. Fourteen suspects are in the dock and another six people are being tried in their absence, five of them presumed dead in Iraq or Syria; the last is in prison in Turkey.

2/10/2022,"The Indian state of Karnataka has shut its schools for three days after the regional government backed schools imposing a ban on hijabs, leading to widespread protests and violence. The issue began in January, when six female Muslim students staged a weeks-long protest after they were told to either remove their headscarves or stop attending class at a government college in the district of Udupi.  Last week, other colleges in the state began to enforce bans after some Hindu students, backed by rightwing Hindu groups, protested that if hijabs were allowed in classrooms, they should be allowed to wear saffron shawls. Saffron is the colour that has become commonly associated with Hindu nationalism. On Saturday, in an apparent backing of schools’ right to impose a ban, the Karnataka state government directed colleges to ensure that “clothes which disturb equality, integrity and public law and order should not be worn”. Muslim students have argued that their right to freedom of religion is being violated, and have taken the issue to state high court. The students have argued that “religious apartheid” is being imposed in some colleges where women in a hijabs are being allowed to enter but are being kept in separate classrooms. The issue has proved highly inflammatory. At some colleges, Muslim students have been aggressively heckled, while in others the protests between students turned violent, prompting police to charge at crowds and fire into the air. On Tuesday, the state chief minister Basavaraj S Bommai suspended schools and colleges for three days and urged students and teachers to “maintain peace and harmony”. Karnataka is run by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), which governs at a national level too. Under its watch there has been a rising tide of anti-Muslim violence and sentiment across India, where 12% of the population is Muslim. The BJP state chief in Karnataka, Nalin Kumar Kateel, has said banning the hijab would ensure that classrooms did not become “Taliban-like”. Rahul Gandhi, leader of the opposition Indian National Congress party, was highly critical. “By letting students’ hijab come in the way of their education, we are robbing the future of the daughters of India,” he said. “Prohibiting hijab-wearing students from entering school is a violation of fundamental rights.” The situation also drew condemnation from the Nobel peace prize winner Malala Yousafzai, who said the situation was “horrifying” and called on Indian leaders to stop the “marginalisation of Indian women”. Muslim students at Dr BB Hegde College in Udupi described how they had turned up to classes last Thursday and found they were barred entry by a large group of men, including fellow students, who were wearing saffron shawls. The group had demanded the Muslim students remove their hijabs. By Friday, the nine Muslim female students – out of more than 1,000 enrolled in the college – had been banned from entering through the school gates in a veil. The principal informed the women that it was a government order and that they must go to the bathroom to remove their hijabs or they could not attend class. After the girls refused to remove their headscarves, the gates of the school were locked to prevent them entering and several police officers were called. Rabiya Khan, a student at the college, said the school’s leadership had come under pressure from rightwing Hindu groups. “The Hindutva [hardline Hindu nationalism] elements don’t have a problem with the hijab, they have problem with our whole religious and cultural identity,” she said. Even though many Hindu students in their classes had privately voiced support for their right to wear a hijab, they were keeping quiet because they were fearful of the actions of vigilante groups, said Khan. As the row erupted and she was sent home from school, Khan’s parents told her to remove the hijab so at least she could still continue getting an education, with her crucial exams just two months away. “But I told them that if we give up, it will boost the morale of communal elements and create problems for the Muslim students in the future,” Khan said. “We have to make sacrifices and stay strong.” Khan emphasised that the Muslim students had never voiced any objection to Hindu students wearing saffron shawls. Saniya Parveen, 20, another Muslim student at the college, said she had worn a hijab to college for three years with no objections, and that Muslims and Hindus had always studied together side-by-side peacefully. Parveen said she and her fellow Muslim students were anxiously waiting for the outcome of the court order to find out whether they would be able to return to their studies. “I hope we will be allowed to attend classes in hijab,” she said. “It is our religious compulsion and a constitutional right; we are not going to surrender.” In Bhandarkars’ Arts and Science College in Udupi district, where a hijab ban was also enforced, one student spoke of her despair at Muslim students being made to feel like “beggars at the college gates”. “It is humiliating,” she said. “We used to feel so safe inside the campus and never felt we were in any way different from our Hindu classmates. Suddenly we are being made to feel like outsiders. For the first time we were made to realise that we were Muslims and they are Hindus.” In a statement, the Karnataka spokesperson for Vishva Hindu Parishad, one of the rightwing groups at the forefront of the anti-hijab protests, termed the hijab row “a conspiracy to propagate jihadi terrorism” and said that Muslim students were attempting “hijab jihad” in college campuses. Apoorvanand, a professor of Hindi at the University of Delhi, said the controversy was part of a larger project whereby “Muslim identity markers are being declared as sectarian and undesirable in public spaces”. “It is telling Muslims and non-Hindus that the state will dictate their appearance and their practices,” he said. On Monday, some students in hijabs were allowed into the government pre-university college in Udupi but were forced to sit in segregated classrooms. “We were made to sit in a separate room and no teacher came to teach us,” said one student. “We were just sitting there like criminals.”",News/World news,Violent clashes over hijab ban in southern India force schools to close,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/09/violent-clashes-over-hijab-ban-in-southern-india-force-schools-to-close
2/10/2022,"Intentionally or not, Tom Cruise has become the public face of pandemic film-making. His long-awaited Top Gun sequel has been booted down the release schedules even more than No Time to Die; its original release date of July 2019 was first pushed back a year, then held there for two more because of Covid. When the world (prematurely) thought that the virus had been sent packing in 2020, he made a special video about how much he loves going to the cinema. And then, of course, there was the leaked audio of him (correctly) going full nut-nut at his crew for breaching social distancing rules. Tom Cruise owns the pandemic, just like he owns running in films and sending out cakes at Christmas.  However, this has come at a price. Yesterday, Variety revealed that the production budget for Cruise’s upcoming Mission: Impossible 7 has ballooned beyond all proportion. Thanks to a frantic shooting schedule that effectively saw Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie racing around the world trying to beat the disease – stopping and starting production seven different times since February 2020 – the film has now burned through $290m. The budget increased with each shutdown, since the cast and crew remained employed throughout the downtime. Set pieces requiring the expensive closure of vast swathes of cities – including, according to Variety, an elaborate action scene during Carnival Venice – were cancelled and rescheduled over and over again. And then, with the rest of the world sheltering in place, the production found itself unable to locate much in the way of essential film-making materials like lumber. As if you need to be told, this is a huge amount of money. Not only is it a full hundred million dollars more than the previous instalment – 2018’s Mission: Impossible - Fallout – but it shoves the film into the upper echelons of the most expensive movies ever made. And it’s no exaggeration to say that the air is awfully thin up there. Adjusted for inflation, the current budget – which, let’s not forget, doesn’t cover the gargantuan expense of publicity and marketing – makes Mission: Impossible 7 the 13th most expensive film ever made. And while in some circumstances this could be seen as an absurd power-move, since some of the other most expensive films (like Avengers: Endgame and Titanic) are also the most successful, but nor is it something to boast about. The 12th most expensive film is the notorious flop Waterworld, and the 11th most expensive is the even more notorious flop John Carter. The eighth is Justice League, a film with a budget so high that it took more than half a billion dollars and still somehow lost Warner Bros $60m. Another problem for Mission: Impossible 7 is that it’s being filmed back-to-back with Mission: Impossible 8, rumoured to be the last in the series, and Cruise is apparently so determined to land the cliffhanger between the two that the first film won’t be released until the second one is completed. So far, this means that the seventh instalment will come out next summer and the eighth in 2024, but that may still change. And, needless to say, the longer you sit on a film, the more expensive it becomes. And if that wasn’t enough, then cinemas still face an uphill battle getting anyone to actually go there. Although Spider-Man: No Way Home punched an almighty hole in the side of the post-Covid box office, it stands surrounded by colossal flops. The Last Duel, West Side Story, The Matrix 4 and Moonfall have all died a horrible death theatrically, and there’s little sign that things will let up any time soon. Additionally, frosty China-US relations mean that a film like Mission: Impossible 7 can no longer count on a hefty Chinese box office windfall. On paper, Mission: Impossible 7 is sailing into a perfect storm. If a bad wind blows on the film, however gently, then we could be looking at an all-time trainwreck. That said, I remain optimistic. Because the Mission: Impossible films are as close to perfect as action films can get. They’re huge, propulsive, visceral beasts that do everything in their power to drag the audience along with them. One of my favourite ever cinema moments came halfway during Fallout when, after an electrifying motorbike chase through Paris, you could hear everyone in the entire theatre remembering to breathe again. It’s becoming slightly cliched to say that films deserve to be watched on the largest screen possible, but it remains absolutely true for the Mission: Impossible films. They’re joyous, giddy spectacles that deserve to be watched collectively. Cruise has come through worse than this before. When Sumner Redstone attempted to cancel him back in 2006, effectively banning him from Paramount, Mission: Impossible 3 quickly became the lowest grossing of the series. But he’s bounced back phenomenally well, with the last three Mission: Impossible films becoming the highest grossing of his entire career. Mission: Impossible 7 is going to be a success, even if I have to go to the cinema a thousand times to see it.",Arts/Film,How did Mission: Impossible 7 become one of the most expensive films ever?,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/09/mission-impossible-7-tom-cruise
