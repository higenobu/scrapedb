5/6/2022,"The Fed may no longer be a friend of investors, pros say, and that could be a major headwind to stocks in the near-term. ""What’s dangerous about yesterday’s huge market slump is that there must be an element of doubting the ability of there to be an effective 'Fed Put' in this cycle following a 30-40 year period where the central bank has almost always been able to come to the market's rescue,"" Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 1,120 points on Thursday, or 3.3%. The S&P 500 tanked 3.7%. As for the Nasdaq Composite, it tanked 5.2% for its worst day since 2020. Amazon shares hit a fresh 52-week low. ""As bad as today was, the VIX Index is not showing sufficient 'fear' to indicate a near term bottom,"" said the team at DataTrek. The VIX settled at 32.85 on Thursday. Thursday's brutal session represented a swift sentiment reversal from Wednesday, when traders breathed a sigh of relief after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that the central bank was not considering a 75 basis-point increase in interest rates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 932.27 points and the S&P 500 gained 2.99% on Wednesday, the largest gains for the two indices since 2000. Even the beaten-up Nasdaq Composite popped 3.19%. As Reid suggested, it now appears that traders have formed a more lasting near-term view that the Fed is far from dovish, has let inflation get out of control, and is still poised to dramatically slow down the economy through a series of 50 basis point rate increases. ""I can't help but think that a great deal of the reaction yesterday was the appreciation that whilst the Fed can make soothing pronouncements, they are starting from an extraordinary difficult starting point and with limited flexibility to respond to market or economy concerns whilst they fight inflation,"" Reid added. ""The only conclusion you can draw is that the market quickly realized that the Fed really aren't going to be able to control this cycle very easily.""

5/6/2022,"By Tommy Wilkes and Muvija M LONDON (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida took his appeal for foreign investment to the bankers and investors of the City of London on Thursday, saying his shift to an upgraded version of capitalism would spur economic growth. In a speech at the medieval Guildhall at the heart of Britain's financial district, Kishida set out his plan to grow the world's third-largest economy by attracting private-sector investment and redistributing wealth. Japan, like countries around the world, has been hit by rising energy, food and living costs however, and its economy is expected to have slowed to a crawl in the first quarter while the yen trades at two-decade lows to the dollar. In a world of geopolitical instability, Kishida said Japan could stand out. It has vowed to double the amount of foreign direct investment to 80 trillion yen ($617 billion), or 12% of GDP in 2030, from the current 43.5 trillion yen, and encourage firms to increase wages and spend more on research and development. ""Of course, Japan does face many challenges,"" he said. ""But I am prepared to lead reform efforts to tackle these challenges head-on. ""Sustained growth; stable markets; and safe, reliable companies, products and services. This is why Japan is a 'buy'"". Kishida, who became prime minister and won an election last autumn, had been on an extended visit to Southeast Asia before he arrived in London to address the City of London and meet British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Delivering his speech on the economy, he acknowledged the country faced challenges including labour shortages and said companies there needed to become more diverse. He said the government would introduce tax incentives to encourage the private sector to boost wages, and that further R&D investment was needed to hit international levels. The yen's weakness would normally be a boon for inbound travellers, but Japan, fearing COVID-19, has kept its borders closed to tourists. Once a boost to Japan's trade-reliant economy, yen weakness is also benefiting exporters to a lesser extent as many Japanese firms have shifted production overseas. The government recently upgraded its assessment of the economy for the first time in four months, citing an expected recovery in spending, but warned the outlook was clouded.

5/6/2022,"TOKYO (AP) — Japan should do more for peaceful diplomacy with China and not just focus on arms deterrence as tensions rise around Taiwan to the west of Okinawa, said the southern island prefecture's governor Friday, demanding further reduction of its security burden and its risk hosting U.S. military there. “We are strongly alarmed,” Okinawa Gov. Denny Tamaki said, by discussions at parliament about a potential Taiwan emergency — particularly on the premise that Okinawa would be embroiled because of its relative closeness 600 kilometers (370 miles) east of Taiwan across the East China Sea. Tamaki was speaking online from the prefectural capital of Naha ahead Okinawa's 50th anniversary of its reversion to Japan on May 15, which came 20 years after most of Japan regained independence from the post-war U.S. occupation of 1945-1952. Instead of celebratory mood, there is concern on Okinawa, with its heavy burden of hosting American troops amid escalating tension in the region over China’s increasingly assertive military actions and rivalry with the United States. There is also concern that Russian invasion of Ukraine may embolden China. In what it calls a warning to Taiwan independence supporters and their foreign allies, China has been staging threatening exercises and flying military planes near the island’s airspace, including on Feb. 24, the day Russia began its invasion of Ukraine. Despite that, Chinese officials including leader Xi Jinping say they are committed to using peaceful means to bring Taiwan under Beijing’s control. The U.S. has consistently expressed its support for ensuring that Taiwan can defend itself, and Chinese military action against the island in the short- to medium-term is generally considered a remote possibility. But the ongoing tension has rekindled fears among Okinawans that they may be sacrificed again by mainland Japan, as in the Battle of Okinawa that killed some 200,000 people, half of them local civilians. “Any escalation of problems over the Taiwan Strait and the contingency of Okinawa being a target of attack must never happen or be allowed to happen,” Tamaki said. Noting that China is Japan's biggest trade partner and Japan being China's second-largest, Tamaki said their close economic ties would be indispensable. “I call for the Japanese government to always maintain calm and peaceful diplomacy and dialogue to improve its relations with China, while working toward easing U.S.-China tension,” he said. Okinawa at the time of reversion asked Japan to make it a peaceful island free of military bases. Today, it is still burdened with the majority of about 50,000 U.S. troops and their military facilities in Japan under the bilateral security treaty. Because of the concentration of U.S. military, Okinawa is faced with noise, pollution, aircraft accidents and crime related to American troops and their bases on daily basis, Tamaki said. In addition to those “visible problems,"" he said, “there are also the problems hindering economic development of Okinawa and structural problems. That excessive U.S. base burden is still unresolved 50 years after the reversion.” Tamaki urged the government effort to raise awareness of Okinawa's overburden of security that he says should be shared by all of Japan. Okinawa called on Tokyo and Washington last year to gradually halve U.S. military presence on Okinawa, speed up the removal of the Futenma air station from a crowded neighborhood and abandon the ongoing construction of runways at Henoko on the eastern coast, he said. ""Okinawa's burden of the U.S. military bases is a key diplomatic and security issue that concerns all Japanese people. We need to return to the basic principle of sharing the burden throughout Japan,” he added. The biggest sticking point between Okinawa and Tokyo is the central government’s insistence on the relocation of Futenma to Henoko. Japan’s central government says the Henoko plan is the only feasible plan and has been forcing it forward despite yearslong rejection by Okinawan people. While Okinawa's development projects over the past five decades have helped the the economy, the average Okinawan's income has remained the lowest among 47 Japanese prefectures, Tamaki said. If lands taken by the U.S. military are returned to the prefecture for economic use, it would triple Okinawa's U.S. military-related income, Tamaki said. Japan considers China’s military rise as a regional threat and has increasingly shifted its troops to defend southwestern remote islands, including Okinawa and its outer islands, deploying missile defense systems and other facilities, while increasing joint drills with U.S. military and other regional partners.",World/Associated Press,Okinawa seeks Tokyo's help lowering tensions with China,https://news.yahoo.com/okinawa-seeks-tokyos-help-lowering-093615478.html
