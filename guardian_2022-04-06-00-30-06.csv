4/6/2022,"The government is hoping to cash-in on a £1bn-plus bidding battle by offering the chance to own a British broadcasting crown jewel – but Channel 4’s existing business model make it an unattractive prospect for many potential buyers. Channel 4 was founded by Margaret Thatcher’s government 40 years ago to provide a culturally challenging alternative to the BBC and ITV. It is publicly-owned but commercially-funded. Its existing public service broadcasting-led remit requires it to reinvest profits into new commissions and buying commercially unattractive – but culturally important – content such as news, current affairs, films and documentaries. This is the antithesis of a golden ticket for private equity investors, who want to cut costs and boost profit margins. Channel 4 executives had instead presented an alternative plan to government called “The Next Episode” to avoid privatisation, based on the potential for a rapid increase in revenues from the broadcaster’s digital operations. This would have seen increased programme investment, a strategy to further boost the government’s regional “levelling up” agenda, and leverage more financial flexibility. Government sources insist Channel 4’s counter-proposals to privatisation were a non-starter and were not “serious”. Instead, ministers insist a privatised Channel 4 can make a profit even while being required to retain many of its public service requirements, including a commitment to prime time news. Analysts believe that a profit-hunting new owner would still be able to make hefty cuts to Channel 4’s programming budget, which would ultimately affect the quality of on-screen content, while fulfilling the letter of the law on public service broadcasting requirements. Any changes would be monitored by Ofcom but the government has recently appointed Michael Grade – a supporter of Channel 4 privatisation – to lead the board of the media regulator. Channel 4 had an annual programming budget of about £660m a year before the pandemic, funding the likes of It’s A Sin and The Great British Bake Off. It currently has a profit margin of just 8% – about half the level of commercial peers across Europe. Its rival Channel 5, which was acquired by the US giant Paramount in 2014, manages to fulfil its public service broadcasting obligations while spending just £240m annually. Analysts at Ampere argue Channel 4’s programme budget could be cut by 40% or even 50% under a new profit-seeking ownership, with a knock-on effect of putting as many as 60 small production companies across the UK out of business. “The big question is: what is it that is being bought?” asked one city source. “The government has to decide what it is selling. Is it essentially selling just a license to broadcast? How much will its remit change in reality?” Even when making the case for privatising the channel, government sources have been happy to admit that Channel 4 is currently in a strong financial position. They argue instead that the broadcaster is a “depreciating asset” that is in “good shape at the moment but won’t be soon”, prompting an urgent need to sell. Enders Analysis has said that Channel 4’s value could be anywhere between £600m and £1.5bn depending on how much freedom over its model a new owner is given. One of the first assets to go could be Channel 4’s distinctive headquarters in Victoria, London, which could be worth up to £100m. The broadcaster’s efforts to expand its physical presence in Leeds, Glasgow, and Bristol in recent years would probably be curtailed as an inefficient allocation of resources. It is unlikely that a subscription-based streaming company such as Netflix would be interested in buying Channel 4. Instead, it is of most value to rival broadcasters – such as Sky, ITV, Discovery and Channel 5’s parent company, Paramount – none of which would want to see it fall into the clutches of the other. Another option could be a management buy-out that retained the current executive team. Channel 4 derives more than 90% of its almost £1bn annual revenues from advertising and holds about a 28% share of the total UK TV ad market. Its rival ITV is the largest player, with a 45% share, and Sky Media, which also sells Channel 5’s ads, has about a 27% share. “Ad sales consolidation is a major driver of this sale. Nobody can afford to lose: it’s like musical chairs,” said one former top TV executive. “ITV and Sky/Channel 5 are worried that they will lose pricing leverage because of a loss of scale. The government is setting it up to make sure everyone bids in a form of self defence, with wishful thinking in terms of [maintaining] remit delivery, which will get commercially conveniently diluted over time.” Sky, ITV, Discovery and Paramount all declined to comment on whether they would be interested in a purchase – although there is little doubt that a large number of potential purchasers are running the numbers on whether they could make a profit from Channel 4.",News/Media,Channel 4: who’s in the running to buy the British broadcaster?,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/05/channel-4-whos-in-the-running-to-buy-the-british-broadcaster

4/6/2022,"A Kent woman who has invited a Ukrainian family of refugees into her home was told by John Lewis Home Insurance that she had to pay an extra £41 a year as a result. Despite promises by the Association of British Insurers that people would not be penalised for taking in those fleeing the Ukrainian war, John Lewis demanded an extra £41.74 from Cath Bateman, on top of the £381 it recently charged to renew her home insurance. Bateman, who lives in a terrace house in Dartford, decided to offer the Ukrainian family somewhere to stay after learning that they were crammed into a small house. The family – a mother, her daughter aged 12 and four-year-old son – had been rescued from Poland by the mother’s sister, who is originally from Ukraine but now lives in the UK. After the Guardian raised her case with the company, John Lewis said a mistake had been made, and that Bateman would be refunded. “I don’t have a big house but had two free rooms and offered to put them up when I learned that they were having to sleep on the floor,” said the retired teacher. “I thought I had better tell my insurer – more out of courtesy than anything – but couldn’t believe it when they called me back to say that I would have to pay an extra £41. It feels completely wrong.” At the start of the conflict the Association of British Insurers said the industry stood “united with the people of Ukraine in the face of the Russian invasion” and that people housing refugees would not face financial penalty. “If you are a homeowner in the UK and want to temporarily house refugees who have been displaced from the conflict in Ukraine as non-paying guests in your home, you do not need to inform your insurer and your cover will remain the same,” it said. “This applies for the first 12 months of any refugees living with you, including when your policy is due for renewal. After 12 months, if any refugees are still living with you, then you should tell your insurer when you next renew your policy.” A spokesperson for John Lewis said: “We aren’t charging any additional premiums for our customers who are welcoming Ukrainian refugees into their homes. We’re very sorry a mistake was made in this case and the customer will receive a full refund.” This was just one issue faced by Bateman. She has been told that because the family were brought into the UK on a family visa by the sister, she will not be able to claim the £350 a month payments the government has offered. She has also been told that she has to get a £95 gas boiler safety certificate at her own expense. “I’m still really pleased I have done it, and we are getting on well. However, the authorities could certainly do more to make it easier. Why those who help people who are brought in on family visas are not entitled to the £350 payments is beyond me. All our attempts to address this have so far failed.”",Lifestyle/Money,UK woman told to pay extra home insurance to host Ukrainian family,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/05/uk-woman-told-to-pay-extra-home-insurance-to-host-ukrainian-family
4/6/2022,"Ivanka Trump will testify before the January 6 committee on Tuesday. The Guardian confirmed that former president Donald Trump’s oldest daughter, and former senior White House adviser, will speak to the panel virtually. Her testimony will come after that of her husband and fellow former presidential adviser, Jared Kushner, who spoke to the panel for more than six hours last week. After Kushner’s testimony, Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat and a member of the committee, told the Guardian: “There’s a momentum to this process when there’s cooperation. When people see that others are doing the right thing, it gives them the courage to do the right thing.” A bipartisan Senate report linked seven deaths to the attack on the US Capitol on 6 January 2021, by supporters Donald Trump told to “fight like hell” in service of his attempt to overturn his defeat by Joe Biden. Trump was impeached for inciting an insurrection but acquitted when enough Republican senators stayed loyal. The House’s January 6 committee includes two Republicans, Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois. As the Guardian reported this week, the committee has identified Ivanka Trump as a senior adviser who would have known her father’s attempt to block certification of electoral college results at the Capitol was unlawful. Referring to a law professor who presented the plan to block certification, a federal judge recently said it was “more likely than not that President Trump and Dr [John] Eastman dishonestly conspired to obstruct the joint session of Congress on January 6 2021”, and thereby committed multiple felonies. The committee also hopes Ivanka Trump might help explain a more-than seven-hour gap in White House call logs for 6 January. Ivanka Trump’s role in her father’s administration has long been a lightning rod for controversy. On Monday, the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew) said: “Here’s a question Ivanka Trump can answer: how did she and Jared make up to $640m while working ‘for free’ in the White House?”",News/US news,Ivanka Trump to testify before panel investigating Capitol attack,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/05/ivanka-trump-capitol-attack-committee-january-6
4/6/2022,"A 14-year-old autistic girl was unlawfully detained in hospital and restrained in front of scared child patients, a high court judge has found. On one occasion last month the teenager managed to break into a treatment room where a dying infant was receiving palliative care. She was restrained there by three security guards, Mr Justice MacDonald said, in a judgment in the family court that ordered Manchester city council (MCC) to find the girl a suitable community care placement instead of what he described as the “brutal and abusive” and “manifestly unsuitable” hospital environment. Nurses witnessed the girl screaming “very loudly” and sounding “very scared” when repeatedly held down on her hospital bed so that she couldn’t move her legs, arms or head, before being tranquillised. Other children on the ward were frightened to witness the frequent battles between the girl and security guards, the judge said. The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was brought to hospital on 15 February by her distressed father, who said the family could no longer care for her. The court heard his other children had begun locking themselves in their bedrooms for safety and that he and his wife had resorted to locking the girl in the dining room to stop her escaping. The judge noted that the teenager made “regular and determined” efforts to run away, sometimes using screwdrivers to try to unlock doors and windows in order to abscond, and running away from her family on walks. She was particularly vulnerable in the community, he said, because she lacked “any road sense of stranger danger and was previously found to have entered a stranger’s house and was found hiding in the bed”. He described the teenager as having an autistic spectrum disorder and a learning disability. She demonstrated “complex and extreme behaviour” that could not even be controlled within a school environment involving six adults to one child supervision, he added. Despite this, the council and NHS trust decided to have the girl be detained in hospital on a general paediatric ward “solely as a place of safety”, without applying for the necessary court order to do so, the judge found. She did not require any medical treatment, the judge said. Following her admission, the local authority employed a private company to provide two security guards and two carers in order to supervise the girl. The firm was engaged on a five-day rolling contract, leading to a high turnover of staff watching the girl night and day, resulting in “her waking up to unfamiliar adults and being scared by that change, further adversely impacting on her behaviour and wellbeing”. She was unable to leave the locked ward and the lock had been removed from her ensuite bathroom door, with her being forced to keep it open, even when using the toilet. She stayed there for a month. Ordering her release from hospital into local authority care, the judge said: “It does not take expert evidence for the court to understand the adverse impact of the current regime, with its uncertainty, its concentration on physical contact and its location in a loud and unfamiliar environment, on a child who is autistic and learning disabled. What this must be like for [her] is hard to contemplate.” In his judgment, MacDonald refused to grant a request from MCC for the local authority to remain anonymous. He criticised the council for failing to find her a suitable placement throughout the month she was unlawfully detained in hospital, accusing the council and unnamed NHS trust of having “comprehensively failed in this case”. Following the hearing, MCC identified a bespoke, short-term placement for the girl and said it continued to search for a residential educational placement for her.",News/UK news,"Autistic girl, 14, unlawfully detained in hospital, high court judge finds",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/05/autistic-girl-14-unlawfully-detained-hospital-high-court-judge-finds
4/6/2022,"Sri Lanka’s economic crisis has deteriorated into a medical crisis, with the top medical union declaring a national health emergency over a life-threatening shortage of drugs. On Tuesday, the country’s most powerful trade union, the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA), called a meeting and declared a medical crisis as doctors and hospitals reported a widespread lack of medicine. The south Asian country is in the grip of the worst financial crisis in its history, with record inflation leading to a shortage of fuel and food, and crippling hours-long power blackouts imposed. A state of emergency has been declared after mass protests erupted across the country calling for President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to step down. On Monday, Rajapaska’s entire cabinet resigned and his ruling government has lost its parliamentary majority after a mass wave of defections. Sri Lanka’s lack of foreign currency reserves has had a devastating impact on the availability of medicine. More than 85% of pharmaceutical products in the country are imported, and these are paid for in US dollars – if dollars are not available then drugs cannot be bought. The Sri Lanka Chamber of Pharmaceutical Industry warned last month that 5% of drugs were out of stock and the problem was likely to worsen. The GMOA accused the government of jeopardising Sri Lanka’s world-renowned universal healthcare system, which gives all citizens access to free state healthcare. “Both the government and health ministry have failed to prevent a complete breakdown of the medical system,” it said in a statement. Gotabhaya Ranasinghe, a cardiologist at the national hospital of Sri Lanka in Colombo, said “the hospitals are all running out of medicines” and that “many lives were at stake”. “There are important heart medications, medicines for blood pressure, heart attacks, all are running out. I have heard that many cancer drugs are also not available any more, so it is a very worrying situation. “People can already visibly see the impact of the food crisis and the fuel crisis but the medical crisis is only just beginning. As a doctor it feels terrible to know that I can’t prescribe medicines and so a patient’s life is put in danger. I don’t think the politicians fully understand the impact.” Ranasinghe said he could not see any silver lining to the economic situation and pleaded for the international community to provide vital drugs. “People are struggling, they are out on the streets, but we are stuck in a terrible limbo and I can’t see a way out of it,” he said. The medicine shortage has been exacerbated by low taxes, meaning little money has been spent on healthcare, and strict price regulation on drugs introduced by the former government and continued under the Rajapaksa regime. The low price caps have meant that, as the Sri Lankan rupee has been devalued and domestic and global inflation rocketed, it was no longer financially viable for importers to bring certain medicines into the country, leading to certain drugs being pulled. “The situation for healthcare has been getting steadily worse over the past six months, with no immediate prospect of a turnaround,” said Ravindra Rannan-Eliya, the executive director of the Institute for Health Policy in Colombo. “Even for those who have money in their pocket, there are no medicines to buy at the pharmacies.” On Tuesday, the political situation was thrown into further turmoil after the ruling coalition, led by Rajapaksa, lost its parliamentary majority after 41 legislators from the president’s coalition partner, the Sri Lanka Freedom party (SLFP), quit the coalition and declared they would be independent. “Our party is on the side of the people,” said Maithripala Sirisena, the SLFP leader. It came a day after the entire cabinet resigned and the opposition refused to form a unity government with Rajapaksa, instead calling for him to resign, which he has refused to do. The newly appointed finance minister resigned less than 24 hours after taking up the post and the protests across the country showed no sign of abating, as police used teargas and water cannon and a curfew was imposed. “We can see from what’s happening on the streets and in our public surveys that people have just lost all faith in the system,” said Rannan-Eliya.",News/World news,Sri Lanka faces medical emergency as economic crisis hits drug supplies,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/05/sri-lanka-faces-medical-emergency-economic-crisis-drug-supplies
4/6/2022,"The Fiver has a recurring nightmare. It’s October 1992 and Richard Keys, his signature plantation of chest hair fighting its way out of a mustard blazer, is forcibly suggesting that we join him for five hours’ coverage of “The Best League. IN THE WORLD.” We sit through Oldham 1-0 Everton, in which Ian Marshall and Robert Warzycha fight to the death for the Miss of the Season award, only to realise that all our European friends are in another room watching Baresi, Maldini, Van Basten, Rijkaard, Boban, Baggio, Möller, Kohler, Vialli, Casiraghi and AC Jimbo while being fed tagliolini pasta with fresh lobster and black truffles and supping glasses of vintage Giuseppe Quintarelli Amarone della Valpolicella Classico Riserva DOCG. Slowly, the full horror emerges: the Fiver is doomed to watch Oldham 1-0 Everton on repeat for eternity, and there’s no tagliolini pasta, either. Then we wake up and realise that such a peculiar torture is probably still preferable to real life. For much of the last 30 years, the insistence – one part smug, two parts Brexit - that the Premier League is the best in the world has felt on the desperate side of pathetic. There were a couple of spells of relative dominance, particularly from 2006-09, but they were usually ended by an unsheathing of the Real Madrid chequebook. This time it feels more sustainable, and not even your nostalgia-leaning Fiver can deny that the Premier League is the strongest around. Two of the last three Big Cup finals were all-English affairs, and there’s a fair chance of another this year. The reason for that is fairly $impl£, but it doesn’t change the fact that English football is as superior as at any stage since the early 1980s. Even Big Cup quarter-finals are starting to feel like a bye, not to mention a backdrop to a league game of far greater importance at the Etihad on Sunday. Few people seriously think Atlético Madrid and Benfica have anything more than a Foinavon’s chance of beating Manchester City or Liverpool over two legs. Those ties get going tonight, and tomorrow Chelsea begin a quarter-final against Real Madrid – Real bloody Madrid, whose 13 Big Cups is only one behind all the English clubs combined – in which they are strongish favourites. The last time there were three English semi-finalists in Big Cup was in 2008-09. The assumption that it will happen again this year is probably restricted to supporters, neutrals and teatime emails. Pep Guardiola, Jürgen Klopp and Tommy T are allergic to complacency, which is one of the 478,124 reasons they are among the world’s best coaches. Liverpool were beaten by Benfica when they last met in Big Cup, but that was 16 years ago and the world – not to mention the quality of Liverpool’s full-backs – has changed a lot since then. All things being equal, Klopp’s men will win in Lisbon tonight and finish the job next week. On their last three visits to Portugal, Liverpool have won 5-1, 4-1 and 5-0. Sure, they were playing Porto each time but our stereotypical English cousin, $exually Repressed Morris Dancing Fiver, insists that Benfica and Porto are basically the same team. There is no side in world football quite like Atlético Madrid, who bring their Travelling Circus of $h!thousery back to Manchester. Atlético are an awkward side who are also in decent form at the moment, with six league wins in a row. But there’s a reason why they are 10-1 to win the first leg at the Etihad and 11-4 to qualify for the semis. It’s because for the first time in the Fiver’s primarily futile existence, the Premier League is indisputably TBITW. It should be a cause for celebration. And yet, despite the recurring nightmare, we still have a soft spot for the days when Keys brainwashed the population of the UK into believing that a goalmouth scramble like this was the pinnacle of world football.

After the roaring success of Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s stint as manager, it makes perfect sense for Manchester United to make another retro appointment. So it is no surprise to learn that, should Erik ten Hag become the club’s new manager, Steve McClaren might be appointed as his assistant. The Fiver cannot wait to hear the effect such a stunt would have on his famously versatile accent. After their 3-0 defeat at Crystal Palace, Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta is angry with his players, which sounds terrifying and not remotely hilarious. “We were late to every ball, we were soft in the duels and we didn’t earn the right to play,” he snivelled. Leah Williamson has been named as England’s captain for this summer’s Euros. “Steph Houghton is one of this country’s all-time greats and to follow in her footsteps – and all of those special names who have led the team in the past – means so much,” trilled Williamson. Clad in what looked liked a Christmas special version of their famous red and black stripes, Milan moved further ahead at the top of Serie A – but their 0-0 home draw with Bologna did not suggest a first title in 11 years is on the agenda. And Mohamed Salah has been advised to find a new club by none other than Ashraf Sobhi, Egypt’s sports minister. “I have advised him to continue his journey at a club other than Liverpool,” said the renowned football expert, “but his direction now is to renew his contract with Liverpool. There are campaigns against Salah directed by some to bring him down, but I asked him not to pay attention to them.” The Big Cup reforms herald the return of the European Super League by another name, says Jonathan Liew.

4/6/2022,"The UK government is moving too slowly to tackle the climate emergency, leading scientists have said in the wake of the latest IPCC report. This comes after Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Brexit minister, declared that he supported “exploiting every last cubic inch of gas from the North Sea” the day the report was released. While the report warned that global emissions must peak by 2025 to stave off the worst impacts of the climate crisis, which would require decisive and immediate action from all countries, scientists say they are concerned the UK government is dragging its feet. Dr Jem Woods, Interim Director of Centre for Environmental Policy at Imperial College and Reader in Sustainable Development, said: “There is minimal to zero alignment between the UK’s net zero strategy and policies and crucial legislation that affect long run infrastructure and investment. In particular, the Local Plan 2030 which has been encouraging new house building has made no consideration of the implications for climate. We can also see similar issues with the Environment Act. New houses built over the next 10 years will lock-in infrastructural investments for decades to come with substantial implications for retrofitting as per Ajay’s (Gambhir) point about not being offered heat pumps rather than gas boilers.” On Monday Rees-Mogg declared that “every last drop of oil from the North Sea” should be excavated. Speaking to LBC radio, he said: “We need to be thinking about exploiting every last cubic inch of gas from the North Sea. We are not going for net zero tomorrow – 2050 is a long way off.” In response to Rees-Mogg’s comments, Ajay Gambhir, a senior research fellow at the Imperial College London Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment, warned: “It’s 1,013 days since the UK government legislated for net zero … we’re not seeing translation of this into on-the-ground measures fast enough.” He added that their actions are unlikely to meet their own carbon reduction targets, let alone those set by the IPCC. “Utility companies are still contacting me about replacing my gas boiler with a new gas boiler – no mention of heat pumps. Will this approach allow 600,000 new installations per year by 2028, as hoped by the government? Grants to electric cars, £4,500 a few years ago, are now £1,500 and now only for those below £32k, with grants to home chargers about to be cut as well. “The government’s net zero strategy of autumn 2021 has several good ideas to develop renewables, hydrogen, carbon capture, low-carbon heating, transport and industrial manufacturing. But there’s basically nothing on behaviour changes, eg around diets and aviation. And full implementation of policies by 2024 (as recommended by the Climate Change Committee) seems questionable,” he said. Campaigners said cabinet ministers did not seem to be taking the IPCC report seriously. Philip Evans, oil and gas transition campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: “As the UN describes further investment in fossil fuels as political and economic madness, the Brexit minister wants to double down. This is intensely foolish as it takes on average 28 years to bring new oil and gas fields online. And even then, the oil and gas extracted doesn’t stay in the UK, it mostly gets sold off on international markets to the highest bidder, doing nothing for household bills in the UK. “Right now oil and gas companies are raking in profits from wartime price spikes, yet the government refuses to bring in a windfall tax that could help ease the cost-of-living crisis for the most vulnerable.” Gambhir added: “It seems strange to be supporting industries whose outputs are increasingly uncompetitive with new green energy sources like solar and wind. North Sea oil and gas assets are owned by private, international companies that sell on global and regional markets, to maximise their profits. Oil and gas majors have benefited from huge tax relief in recent years, amounting to almost £14bn across new exploration, production and decommissioning, as the North Sea becomes a higher cost, dwindling, uncompetitive source of these fuels.” Ministers have also been split on the issue of windfarms. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, and Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, are in favour, but others including Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, brand onshore turbines “an eyesore”. The report, stark as it is, was watered down after an intervention by Saudi Arabia, according to Climate Home. After input by the major oil producer, sources told the website that references to carbon capture technology were added. These methods remain unproven at commercial scale but could give a reprieve to the fossil fuel industry. Compared to earlier drafts, references to shifting away from coal, oil and gas were qualified with the word “unabated” and “fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage” was identified as a way to cut emissions in line with global climate goals.",News/Environment,UK ‘too slow’ over climate crisis despite stark IPCC report,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/05/uk-too-slow-over-climate-crisis-despite-stark-ipcc-report
4/6/2022,"A man with a grudge against his neighbours has been found guilty of murdering a father of three after a jury rejected his claim that a personality disorder meant he could not be held responsible for his actions. Can Arslan, 52, stabbed Matthew Boorman 27 times on his victim’s front lawn in the village of Walton Cardiff near Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire on 5 October last year. Boorman’s wife, Sarah, sustained a knife wound to her thigh as she tried to help her husband while another neighbour, Peter Marsden, was stabbed eight times but managed to fend Arslan off and survived. Arslan had admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility but denied murdering Boorman. A jury at Bristol crown court heard he had been diagnosed with a paranoid, unstable and antisocial personality disorder but the prosecution argued he was fully in control at the time of the attacks and knew the difference between right and wrong. In her closing speech, Kate Brunner QC said Arslan had plotted a script for a real-life horror story with himself as the killer. “It was something he had planned and controlled. It was a horror movie planned out, where he was going to stab his victims to death one by one. A horror movie where he was going to take a starring role, and end up on the TV.” Following his arrest, Arslan asked officers if he was on Sky News or the BBC. Brunner said the defendant had faked a number of different potential psychiatric defences, such as hearing voices telling him to kill and amnesia. She said by faking mental illness Arslan had demonstrated how rational he was. “He is a cunning, smart man trying to pull the wool over eyes,” the prosecutor said. Sarah Boorman had told the court that Arslan had repeatedly threatened to murder her, her husband and their children, taunting them that he would only serve 10 years in prison if he did so. The court heard heard there was a long-running dispute between Arslan and neighbours with small arguments over parking and a scratch to a car escalating to the point where Arslan faced eviction. Gloucestershire police were informed and the day before the killing Arslan had told a police officer he would murder Boorman. Howard Godfrey QC, for Arslan, said the defendant was not trying to “wriggle out” of responsibility for Boorman’s death, but said it was clearly “not normal behaviour”. “He attacks in broad daylight, when everyone is around and there is CCTV everywhere – is that normal?” he asked. “He doesn’t do it at night when someone is out walking their dog and then run away, he doesn’t wear a mask to try and hide who he is.” Godfrey added: “After Mr Boorman was dead, he continued stabbing him 27 times, then lights a cigarette and sits on top of Mr Boorman. Does that seem like normal behaviour?”",News/UK news,Man found guilty of murdering neighbour on front lawn in Gloucestershire,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/05/man-found-guilty-murdering-neighbour-front-lawn-gloucestershire-can-arslan-matthew-boorman
4/6/2022,"Leah Williamson has been named as England’s captain for this summer’s European Championship. The head coach Sarina Wiegman has chosen the Arsenal defender to lead England’s challenge with Millie Bright selected as the vice-captain. The 25-year-old has been the captain in the absence of the injured Steph Houghton. Williamson said: “Steph Houghton is one of this country’s all-time greats and to follow in her footsteps – and all of those special names who have led the team in the past – means so much. “Although I will be wearing the armband, I know we have a squad full of leaders who share my pride and passion in playing for our country. “Whether I am captain or not, I will never take anything for granted and will always do my best for England every time I pull on the shirt.” England are preparing for their World Cup qualifier against North Macedonia on Friday and Northern Ireland next Tuesday.
