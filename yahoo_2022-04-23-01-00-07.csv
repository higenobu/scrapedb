4/23/2022,"Former President Donald Trump mused about embracing being portrayed as a dictator. Trump made the remarks at the Ritz-Carlton on Amelia Island, Fla. on Thursday night. ""Which would you rather be, a dumb person or a dictator? Perhaps a dictator would be better,"" he said. Former President Donald Trump on Thursday joked about being depicted as ""a dictator"" by the press, which he assumed was the result of the cognitive test he has repeatedly bragged about passing in 2018. ""Which would you rather be, a dumb person or a dictator?"" Trump said Thursday night at the Heritage Foundation's annual leadership conference in Florida at the Ritz-Carlton resort on Amelia Island. ""Perhaps a dictator would be better,"" he continued. ""I don't want to be a dumb person."" —Acyn (@Acyn) April 21, 2022 In the same speech, Trump said he was surprised nobody ever found out that he told the president of a NATO country in a closed door meeting that the US would not come to their protection if they didn't increase their defense spending. Experts on authoritarianism have warned that Trump not only frequently praises strongmen dictators on the world stage, but also exhibits authoritarian tendencies of his own, culminating in the January 6 insurrection on Capitol Hill. In the former president's assessment, the dictator chatter only began because he did so well on a cognitive test he took in 2018. ""First they said, 'Not too smart,'"" Trump said earlier in his speech. ""Well that all went away, and I said, 'Doc Ronny [Jackson], I gotta take a test.' He said, ""You know the problem is, sir, this is essentially a public place.' One of the great hospitals of the world, right? You have a series of doctors sitting there and all, and if you do badly, the word's gonna get out ... And I did it in front of a panel, and we aced it. And the one person said, 'That's the first time I've ever seen anyone ace it.' So all of that stuff stopped ... but then they made me a dictator instead."" The test Trump took is called the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, designed to detect signs of dementia. It was also the source of his viral ""person, woman, man, camera, TV"" remarks from July 2020.

4/23/2022,"A Ukrainian woman described her month hiding in a Mariupol basement during Russia's assault. She said when she finally escaped, she witnessed Russians targeting apartment buildings. The journey to safety took 14 hours and she said she was strip-searched by Russian troops at each of the 16 checkpoints. A Ukrainian woman who escaped Russia's assault on Mariupol said that she witnessed Russian troops targeting apartment buildings ""as if they were playing a computer game."" Alina Beskrovna lived in a basement in Mariupol for a month as Russian troops destroyed her city outside. In a first-person account to UN News, she detailed how she went into hiding the morning of February 24 — the day Russia first invaded Ukraine — and stayed there until March 23. She said people who could not get out within the first few days of the invasion were forced to stay because of active fighting in the streets. ""Those who tried to flee found themselves in a battlefield,"" she said. She described hope during the second week of the war when rumors spread on Telegram that there would be a humanitarian corridor opening up for civilians to go west to Manhush, but it turned out to be a false rumor, she said. Mariupol, a port city on Ukraine's southern coast, has been the scene of intense fighting for almost the entirety of Russia's invasion. The city's mayor told the Associated Press last week that 21,000 people had been killed, and those who have fled described the city as ""hell on earth."" When Beskrovna finally decided to risk her life and flee from her hiding spot beneath the city, she said she witnessed Russian attacks with her own eyes. ""I saw with my own eyes how they aimed at apartment buildings, as if they were playing a computer game,"" she recalled. Beskrovna also said that resources quickly dwindled in the basement during her stay, and with Russia targeting the city's electrical, water, and gas systems, they lost access to those necessities early on. She also said communication was cut off very quickly. She said she does not know if her father is alive as they lost contact weeks ago. ""I knew why it was being done: To leave us completely helpless and hopeless, demoralized, and cut off from the outside world,"" she said. On March 23, she was able to board a train to Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, which took 14 hours. She said Russian troops strip-searched her and other passengers at all 16 checkpoints. While she felt relief when she finally heard the Ukrainian language in Zaporizhzhia, she quickly realized that city wasn't safe either. ""Despite feeling as though I was getting out of this black hole of destruction and death, Zaporizhzhia itself wasn't safe; there were constant air raids,"" she said. ""But we had made it out of Mariupol and couldn't believe we were alive.""

4/23/2022,"If long waits or slow service suddenly bedevil a favorite restaurant, it may not be the fault of the employees you see — but rather the ones you don't. An acute labor shortage in the restaurant industry has pushed employment in the sector about 1.5 million jobs below pre-pandemic levels. Moreover, restaurant owners don't expect the problem to resolve itself anytime soon. Roughly half of them say recruiting and retention of employees will be their top challenge in 2022, according to a survey released in January by the National Restaurant Association. In a new interview, celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck told Yahoo Finance why restaurant owners have faced such trouble hiring. When the pandemic drove widespread restaurant closures and millions of employees lost their careers or took up other work, many found that they didn't want to return, Puck said. ""A lot of employees in our industry changed their lifestyle,"" said Puck, who co-founded three companies that operate more than 50 restaurants worldwide. ""They said, 'We don't want to work on Mother's Day, on Christmas Eve, or New Year's Eve, Saturday, Sunday.'"" ""A lot of these people didn't want to come back,"" he added. In this episode of Influencers, Andy sits down with Wolfgang Puck, the world famous restaurateur & chef, as they discuss Wolfgang's upcoming projects, how he's adjusting his menus for inflation, and why he doesn't like to be called a 'celebrity chef'. The labor shortage in the restaurant industry has persisted despite a dramatic rise in wages aimed at bringing workers back. Last year, as dining and travel habits returned to some semblance of normal, the high demand for workers in leisure and hospitality made it the only occupation that saw wage increases outpace inflation, as Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reported. Hourly wages for those workers jumped 11.8% in March compared to a year ago. The Austrian-born restaurateur lamented the failure to attract employees even with the high pay rate offered at Spago, his chain of high-end restaurants with locations in Beverly Hills, Las Vegas, Maui, and elsewhere. ""We have waiters at Spago that make over $120,000, $150,000,"" he said. ""So it's not a job which doesn't pay well, either."" But there is reason for optimism among restaurant owners. The industry has shown signs of increased hiring in recent months. The leisure and hospitality industry led all sectors in hiring last month by adding 112,000 jobs, with more than half of those jobs coming at food service and drinking places, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The hiring gains owe in part to growth in the industry as it bounces back from the pandemic. The food service industry workforce is expected to increase by 400,000 jobs, for total industry employment of 14.9 million workers by the end of 2022, the National Restaurant Association survey found. ""Little by little, they're coming back,"" Puck says. Max Zahn is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.
