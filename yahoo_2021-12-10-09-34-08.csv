12/10/2021,"By Rocky Swift TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's COVID-19 infections are falling in contrast with rebounds in other parts of Asia, baffling experts. New daily infections have slowed to fewer than one per million people, the least among major economies except China, and fatalities have fallen to zero in recent days. South Korea, with similar vaccination coverage, is seeing record infections. Cases remain elevated in Singapore and are rising again in Australia as authorities there relax stringent controls on movement. One new hypothesis to explain the divergence is that the type of coronavirus dominant in Japan evolved in a way that short-circuited its ability to replicate. Ituro Inoue, a professor at Japan's National Institute of Genetics, said that subvariant of Delta, known as AY.29, now may be conferring some immunity in the population. ""I think AY.29 is protecting us from other strains,"" Inoue said, cautioning that his research remained a theory. ""I'm not 100% confident."" Paul Griffin, a professor at the University of Queensland, said differences in case loads between countries resulted from a complex mix of weather, population density, and varying strategies to fight the pandemic. ""We do need to try and take learnings away from other countries, but we shouldn't assume the same experience from country to country, because there are all those variables,"" Griffin said. ""Some countries are using strategies in addition to vaccination to control the spread, whether it's simple measures on hand hygiene, social distancing, and the use of masks and whether that's mandatory or voluntary."" Japan never locked down in the way that many countries did, but it also never let up on behavioural edicts and border restrictions employed before vaccines arrived. ""Wearing masks and personal hygiene rituals are still the same and important,"" said Kazuaki Jindai, a researcher at Tohoku University. ""The vaccine is a crucial aspect of prevention but not the silver bullet."" Even accounting for vaccines and masking, some think the speed of the decline of cases in Japan is a matter of timing. Japan's late start on vaccination means that the potency of the shots are still strong. Others point to seasonal trends, that the virus tends to crest and fall in two-month intervals. WINTER IS COMING Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is leaving little to chance as Japan enters its winter months, which last year saw a deadly infection wave that started in the colder north. He ordered borders shut last week to keep out the Omicron variant of the virus, discovered four times so far in Japan. In contrast, Australia is going ahead with plans to reopen the economy. Now that the country has hit its vaccination targets and with the arrival of COVID-19 therapeutics, it is time to tolerate an uptick in cases, Griffin said. ""Hopefully locking down is something that we reserve for extenuating circumstances,"" he said. Whatever the cause of the decline in cases in Japan, Kishida says it is important to prepare for the worst. Booster shots started last week, and the government has increased hospital capacity by more than 30% since some patients died at home during a fifth wave in August, the worst so far. Researcher Jindai welcomes those preparations but worries about how they will be implemented and whether Japan can shore up its management of healthcare data, which has been a weak point. ""If the ICU beds are full, that means all downstream healthcare will be compromised,"" said Jindai, who also works as a physician in Kanagawa prefecture, south of Tokyo. ""Until we have the sixth wave in front of us, we can't be sure if those measures worked or not.""

12/10/2021,"When the feds raided Jeffrey Epstein’s Manhattan mansion in 2019, they unearthed a trove of evidence including binders of CDs containing tens of thousands of photographs. Some of those never-before-seen images—released by federal prosecutors this week—depicted happier days of the late sex-trafficker’s romance with his alleged accomplice, British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, who is accused of helping him groom and abuse four underage girls from 1994 through 2004. The exhibits contain several snapshots showing Maxwell giving Epstein a foot rub, seemingly on his private jet. Other photos reveal the couple kissing or embracing, riding a motorbike, lounging on a patio, and relaxing outside what appears to be a cabin. The cheery pictures are at odds with the disturbing accusations against them: that for years, Epstein molested and raped scores of teenage girls after paying them for “massages,” and Maxwell allegedly played the role of scheduler and recruiter. Prosecutors say she was an older woman who made these girls and their parents feel at ease, normalized the sexual abuse, and sometimes took part in it herself. The government has described the couple’s alleged sex-trafficking enterprise as a “pyramid scheme of abuse” where they encouraged victims to bring them more girls. During opening arguments in the case, assistant U.S. Attorney ​Lara Pomerantz told jurors that Epstein and Maxwell “were a couple for many years, and when their relationship ended, they remained, in the defendant’s own words, the best of friends.” Maxwell, 59, “was Epstein’s closest associate and second in command,” Pomerantz added. “She was involved in every detail of Epstein's life.” On Tuesday, prosecutors revealed exhibits including Word documents found on hard drives in Epstein’s residence, some allegedly made by a user named “gmax.” One document created in October 2002 seemed to be a glowing biography of Maxwell and Epstein as a couple. Stephen Flatley, an FBI analyst, read excerpts of this computer file aloud but jurors didn’t receive further context on who wrote the profile or why. “Jeffrey and Ghislaine have been together, a couple for the last 11 years,” the document stated. “They are, contrary to what many people think, rarely apart—I almost always see them together.” “Ghislaine is highly intelligent, and great company with a ready smile and an infectious laugh who always puts one at one’s ease, and always makes one feel welcome,” the letter continued. “Jeffrey and Ghislaine share many mutual interests and they have a lot of fun together. They both have keen searching and inquisitive minds.” The document concluded: “Jeffrey and Ghislaine complement each other really well and I cannot imagine one without the other. On top of being great partners, they are also the best of friends.” Prosecutors also presented photos taken of the interiors of Epstein’s Manhattan townhouse in July 2019, when the FBI executed a search warrant. Investigators discovered massage tables covered with white cloth, a safe containing cash, loose diamonds and passports, and collections of CDs and hard drives—including some that were found with “evidence” tape already on them. Last Friday, jurors were also shown a roughly 40-minute video walk-through of Epstein’s Florida mansion taken by Palm Beach police during a search in 2005. Gregory Parkinson, a retired Palm Beach cop and crime-scene manager, testified about photos and video footage taken inside Epstein’s lair, including in his master bedroom and shower rooms where the sexual abuse of minors allegedly occurred. While the police video played, Parkinson described certain decor in the residence: photos of Epstein posing with Fidel Castro, the former president of Cuba, and Pope John Paul II. On Friday morning, the defense and prosecution argued over what other evidence could be presented in court including a collection of schoolgirl costumes found in Epstein’s Manhattan home in 2019—which were ultimately barred as evidence—and photos of unidentified children in the financier’s Palm Beach mansion uncovered in 2005. Maxwell’s lawyer Christian Everdell referred to lurid photographs before jurors came in, describing one image “of a younger girl sort of pulling down her underwear exposing her buttocks” which Nathan had already barred from trial. He said the court also prohibited a photo depicting “a toddler, an infant walking forward towards the camera with an adult in the back, naked” from being entered into evidence. At the time, Everdell said that the government and defense counsel hadn’t reached an agreement on a third photo showing Epstein “with a slightly older girl,” who is likely his “goddaughter.” (Epstein was reportedly godfather to the daughter of his close friends, billionaire Glenn Dubin and his wife Eva Andersson-Dubin, who once dated the elusive money-manager.) “At this point, I believe it is the same girl with her lying across his lap with her bottom—although with underwear on, but he’s got his head down close to the bottom,” Everdell added. “It shows him with a prepubescent girl,” Everdell told Nathan. “There is no allegation that he or Ms. Maxwell, for that matter, were involved in anything with prepubescent females. This is, I believe, the same girl as the toddler photo. It’s his goddaughter.” Assistant U.S. Attorney Maureen Comey noted that the photo of the girl pulling down her underwear was briefly recorded in the walk-through video. “It’s clear that it is the primary decoration right outside of the master bedroom that [Maxwell] shared with Mr. Epstein,” Comey said, later adding: “in order to walk into that room, you have to go by a sexually suggestive photograph of a young girl.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

12/10/2021,"Johnson is facing calls to resign over a leaked video of his staff joking about a Christmas party. Senior SNP MP Ian Blackford said Johnson ""can no longer lead"" on the UK's pandemic response. Johnson has apologized for the leaked video, which dates from December 2020. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was facing calls for his resignation on Thursday after a leaked video showed his staff joking about hosting an illegal Christmas party while the country underwent strict COVID-19 restrictions last year. According to a report from the British tabloid The Daily Mirror, the party took place on December 18, 2020, and involved food and drinks, party games, and a secret Santa gift exchange. Ian Blackford, the Scottish National Party's most senior member of Parliament, said that the ""only right and moral choice left"" for Johnson is to quit. ""Trust in leadership is a matter of life and death. Downing Street willfully broke the rules and mocked the sacrifices we have all made, shattering the public's trust,"" Blackford said in Parliament on Wednesday. ""The prime minister is responsible for losing the trust of the people. He can no longer lead on the most pressing issue facing these islands,"" he said. If Johnson does not resign, Blackford said, ""he must be removed."" Wes Streeting, the Labour Party's shadow health secretary, also suggested the prime minister resign. ""The Prime Minister is in it up to his neck,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""His actions have undermined public trust and distracted from key public health messaging at a critical time. Serious times call for serious leadership and it is clear that Boris Johnson isn't up to the job."" Anger has been mounting among Johnson's own Conservative colleagues over the leaked video, as well as new COVID-19 restrictions that the prime minister announced on Wednesday. One Conservative MP, William Wragg, on Wednesday shouted ""Resign!"" as Health Secretary Sajid Javid, also a Conservative, spoke in the House of Commons, while other MPs heckled him. Johnson has apologized for the video, which was shot in December 2020, and said he was ""shocked"" to see it emerge. It depicts a mock news conference in which his former press secretary Allegra Stratton joked about the supposed Christmas party. The video was obtained by ITV News in the days after sources told media outlets that there had been a party in the prime minister's Downing Street office that broke COVID-19 rules at the time. ""I've just seen reports on Twitter that there was a Downing Street Christmas party on Friday night. Do you recognize those reports?"" Ed Oldfield, an advisor to the prime minister, can be heard asking in the video. ""I went home,"" Stratton said with a laugh. ""Would the prime minister condone having a Christmas party?"" Oldfield then asked. ""What's the answer?"" Stratton joked. At the time of the party and mock news conference, the UK was under Tier 3 restrictions, which limited indoor gatherings to groups of two and prohibited office parties. Stratton resigned over the video, saying she would ""regret the remarks for the rest of my days."" After first denying a party occurred, Johnson announced on Wednesday during a speech at the House of Commons that he would be opening an investigation into the event. ""If rules have been broken, there will be disciplinary action for all those involved,"" he said.

12/10/2021,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — A former deep-sea treasure hunter is preparing to mark his sixth year in jail for refusing to disclose the whereabouts of 500 missing coins made from gold found in an historic shipwreck. Research scientist Tommy Thompson has been held in contempt of court since Dec. 15, 2015, for that refusal. He is also incurring a daily fine of $1,000. Thompson's case dates to his discovery of the S.S. Central America, known as the Ship of Gold, in 1988. The gold rush-era ship sank in a hurricane off South Carolina in 1857 with thousands of pounds of gold aboard, contributing to an economic panic. Despite an investors lawsuit and a federal court order, Thompson, 69, still won't cooperate with authorities trying to find those coins, according to court records, federal prosecutors and the judge who found Thompson in contempt. Thompson says he’s already said everything he knows about the coins. Thompson pleaded guilty in April 2015 for his failure to appear for a 2012 hearing and was sentenced to two years in prison and a $250,000 fine. But Thompson’s criminal sentence has been delayed until the issue of the gold coins is resolved. Federal law generally limits jail time for contempt of court to 18 months. But a federal appeals court in 2019 rejected Thompson’s argument that that law applies to him, saying his refusal violates conditions of a plea agreement. After technology problems cancelled Thompson's latest virtual hearing last week, federal Judge Algenon Marbley scheduled a new hearing for Jan. 7. A treasure hunter on the run for two years is now in handcuffs. Tommy Thompson gained notoriety in 1988, when he found the sunken ship ""S S Central America,"" nicknamed the ""ship of gold."" The ship went down in 1857, taking with it nearly 500 passengers, and thousands of pounds of gold.

12/10/2021,"What is Donald Trump really worth to a business? He's known for making lavish claims about what his “brand” is worth. Others have punctured his estimates as wildly inflated, especially since the reputational hits he took at the end of his presidency. But now we have a new kind of answer, thanks to investors. The Trump aura alone — at least to a media startup — appears to be worth a neat $1 billion. That’s how much secret financiers are investing in Trump’s newly formed Trump Media & Technology Group, which is going public by merging with a shell company called Digital World Acquisition. TMTG, as Bloomberg Opinion’s Timothy L. O’Brien and Matt Levine explain, has no products, no revenue, no cash flow, no known intellectual property, no big names attached and no “clear business plan,” only a wispy promise to build a new social media network (Truth Social) to take on Twitter, Facebook, Amazon and other tech companies. And yet the company has excited traders enough to boost its current market value to more than $2 billion. You might think that this means the Trump brand is actually worth $2 billion, but you’d be wrong: The speculative run-up of the stock is a reaction to the $1 billion the Trump brand attracted, not to the Trump brand alone. Did we say there are no big names attached to TMTG? Well, Trump is chair, and he is a big name. But he has no tech experience and a mixed record, at best, as a company-builder. The second biggest name at TMTG is Devin Nunes, whom Trump just appointed as the company’s CEO. Nunes is a soon-to-retire Republican member of Congress who has degrees in agriculture science and lots of experience running his family’s dairy farm, but no tech background. Sounds like a great starting rotation for a phantom team! The ridicule that’s gushing down on Trump’s company from the tech and financial press is wholly warranted. Putting money into the company is “is closer to gambling than investing,” says Marketwatch. TMTG has already blown through its promise to produce a beta version of its Truth software by November and the Securities and Exchange Commission has commenced an investigation of whether Trump’s media company had broken securities laws in its formation. All this flakiness gives us a safe harbor the size of the San Francisco Bay to speculate that Trump hasn’t set out to create a viable media business as much as he has dreamed up a new fusion of politics, media and finance designed with one primary objective: To give people who like Trump an easy and legal way to give Trump money. The way TMTG has come charging out of the gate with no product and no revenue but ample investors has financial journalists comparing it to a meme stock (like Gamestop, AMC and Blackberry) — securities that appeal to naïve retail investors who willingly ignore business fundamentals and buy depending on which way the social media winds blow. A different point of comparison might be with other ex-presidents looking to cash in on their political celebrity. Trump isn’t the first to board the money-go-round after leaving office. In the first dozen years out of office, Bill Clinton collected $106 million for giving speeches. Barack and Michelle Obama reportedly signed a $65 million book deal. But no former president — and certainly no former president who is preparing to run again — has ever dipped his cup into financial markets to raise the sort of money TMTG has raised overnight. The prospect of another Trump run again raises fresh ethical issues. Who might the unnamed investors enlisted by Trump be, O’Brien asks in his column? To whom might Trump become financially beholden? Who will have financial hooks into him if he regains the White House? The Saudis? United Arab Emirates? Russian oligarchs? Drug cartels? Any one of these groups would represent a conflict of interest — not to mention a potential national security threat — that would make his Trump Hotel entanglements look like free tickets to a monster truck show. What, exactly, did unnamed investors buy when they dropped their millions into TMTG? And should we worry about them getting fleeced? No. This is 2021, after all, and even naïve investors know the wretched history of Trump’s bankruptcies, his poor record of running public companies, and his failure to pay back loans. That he’s a stinker of a business partner is deeply baked into his persona by now. Anybody willing to invest with him today has either convinced themselves they’ll find a greater fool they can sell their shares to later at a profit, or has decided that millions of dollars they’ve invested will pay off with favors if he returns to the White House. Trump’s media company may look like a scam, but you’ve got to admire the way he’s leveraged his name into a billion-dollar cascade that fills his coffers and also gives him a new vantage point to conduct his campaign against other media. “$1 billion sends an important message to Big Tech that censorship and political discrimination must end. America is ready for TRUTH Social, a platform that will not discriminate on the basis of political ideology,” was the way Trump bragged about it in a Saturday press release about a new round of investment. The size of Trump’s own stake in TMTG remains unknown, but it’s likely to have produced a better short-term payout than the 40 percent of the company the social media site Parler was said to have offered him at the beginning of the year to make it his home on the web. Why share his aura with Parler, he obviously thought, when capturing most of the value of Trumpiness for himself was possible? Will TMTG end up a financial winner like Trump Tower, or a dud and an embarrassment like Trump Steaks? The 2016 election results are a permanent reminder that nobody should ever underestimate Trump. But does he possess the drive and retain the personal appeal to his fans that convert them into devoted users of Truth Social? Dan Alexander, who has been following the Trump initiative for Forbes, writes that the company could be worth $5.6 billion if it succeeds in attracting about 29 million users (one-third of the 86 million who followed Trump on Twitter), they become dedicated users, and TMTG serves them ads at Twitter’s rates ($186 per user). These are all big ifs, of course. Changing users’ media habits with a new site can be formidable. Parler, launched in 2018 as a Twitter alternative for the right-leaning, had only about 2.3 million active users last December, according to CNN. In the coming months, as Truth Social goes live and users download the app, we’ll quickly find out if Trump is worth the $1 billion bet investors have placed on him, or if the Trump aura is actually a mirage as TMTG collapses into lawsuits, acrimony and financial penalties extracted by the federal government in Trump University fashion. Either way, you can be assured that Trump will come out of it with a handful of cash. He always seems to. ****** Truth Social should market itself as America’s first anti-social media site.

12/10/2021,"Though Dirt prides itself on accuracy, occasionally we do get it wrong. One of those occasions was back in July, when we erroneously reported on an $83 million house sale in Pacific Palisades. At the time, rumors swirled that the buyer was a “mystery crypto billionaire,” who had quickly ridden the bitcoin wave to overnight riches, though months passed and still everyone was strangely unable to name the crypto investor in question. It’s probably no wonder, because it turns out that camera-shy “mystery crypto buyer” doesn’t actually exist. According to multiple sources — and now confirmed by a thorough cross-examination of property records — the buyer was actually Austin Russell, the 26-year-old tech wunderkind who’s CEO and founder of self-driving car automation pioneer Luminar. Founded in 2012, Luminar initially operated in stealth mode, and it remained largely unknown to the public until 2017, when the company began partnering with many of the world’s largest carmakers. Initially based in Silicon Valley but now headquartered in Orlando, Luminar develops laser-based radar sensor tech for automobiles, specifically for those upcoming models with yet-to-be-released autonomous driving features. Luminar went public last December, making Russell an overnight billionaire. Forbes subsequently crowned him the world’s “youngest self-made” billionaire; as of today, the publication estimates his net worth tops $1.7 billion. Russell, who was born and raised in the swanky Southern California city of Newport Beach by well-to-do parents — his father Michael Russell works in commercial real estate and is now employed at Luminar, his mother is former model and actress Shannon Cleye, who had a recurring role on “The Young and the Restless” — isn’t any stranger to big money. While in college at Stanford University, he dropped out to receive a $100,000 grant from Peter Thiel, funds that enabled him to grow Luminar. One of the company’s earliest and biggest financial backers was also fellow billionaire Alec Gores, who serves on its board of directors. While Luminar’s IPO made Russell a billionaire on paper — supposedly the “world’s youngest self-made billionaire,” remember — it didn’t necessarily make him cash-rich. Per public SEC documents, the SoCal native takes home a paltry $300,000 annual salary, certainly leagues from mogul cash flow and the down payment needed on an $83 million house.

12/10/2021,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal appeals court ruled Thursday against an effort by former President Donald Trump to shield documents from the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol. In a 68-page ruling, the three-judge panel tossed aside Trump's various arguments for blocking through executive privilege records that the committee regards as vital to its investigation into the run-up to the deadly riot aimed at overturning the results of the 2020 presidential election. Judge Patricia Millett, writing for the court, said Congress had “uniquely vital interests” in studying the events of Jan. 6 and said President Joe Biden had made a “carefully reasoned"" determination that the documents were in the public interest and that executive privilege should therefore not be invoked. Trump also failed to show any harm that would occur from the release of the sought-after records, Millett wrote. “On the record before us, former President Trump has provided no basis for this court to override President Biden’s judgment and the agreement and accommodations worked out between the Political Branches over these documents,” the opinion states. It adds, ""Both Branches agree that there is a unique legislative need for these documents and that they are directly relevant to the Committee’s inquiry into an attack on the Legislative Branch and its constitutional role in the peaceful transfer of power. The appeals court ruled that the injunction that has prevented the National Archives from turning over the documents will expire in two weeks, or when the Supreme Court rules on an expected appeal from Trump, whichever is later. Lawyers for Trump can also ask the entire appeals court to review the case. Seven of the 11 appellate judges on the court were appointed by Democratic presidents, four by Republican presidents. Trump spokeswoman Liz Harrington said after the ruling: “Regardless of today’s decision by the the appeals court, this case was always destined for the Supreme Court. President Trump’s duty to defend the Constitution and the Office of the Presidency continues, and he will keep fighting for every American and every future Administration.” The court wrote: “The privilege being asserted is not a personal privilege belonging to former President Trump; he stewards it for the benefit of the Republic. The interests the privilege protects are those of the Presidency itself, not former President Trump individually. And the President has determined that immediate disclosure will promote, not injure, the national interest, and that delay here is itself injurious.” The court also praised Biden’s “calibrated judgement” in working with Congress and the Archives to weigh privilege concerns, saying it “bears no resemblance to the ‘broad and limitless waiver’ of executive privilege former President Trump decries."" Biden had the committee defer its requests for some of the early documents that might have posed privilege claims, and officials expect more documents in subsequent tranches will be subject to the same outcome. The House committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi released a statement saying: ""Today, the Courts have once again rejected the former President’s campaign to obstruct Congress’s investigation into the January 6th insurrection. No one can be allowed to stand in the way of the truth — particularly not the previous President, who incited the insurrection.” White House spokesman Mike Gwin said, “As President Biden determined, the constitutional protections of executive privilege should not be used to shield information that reflects a clear and apparent effort to subvert the Constitution itself.” Trump sued the House Jan. 6 committee and the National Archives to stop the White House from allowing the release of documents related to the insurrection. Biden had waived Trump’s executive privilege claims as the current officeholder. At issue, the court said, is not that Trump “has no say in the matter” but his failure to show that withholding the documents should supersede Biden's “considered and weighty judgment” that Congress is entitled to them. The National Archives has said that the records Trump wants to block include presidential diaries, visitor logs, speech drafts, handwritten notes “concerning the events of January 6” from the files of former chief of staff Mark Meadows, and “a draft Executive Order on the topic of election integrity.” Arguing for the committee, U.S. House lawyer Douglas Letter argued that the determination of a current president should outweigh predecessors in almost all circumstances and noted that both Biden and Congress were in agreement that the Jan. 6 records should be turned over. All three of the appeals court judges who heard the arguments were nominated by Democrats. Millett and Judge Robert Wilkins were nominated by former President Barack Obama. Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is a Biden appointee seen as a contender for a Supreme Court seat should one open during the current administration. Republican presidents nominated six of the nine Supreme Court justices, including three chosen by Trump. __ Associated Press writers Jill Colvin and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.",Politics/Associated Press,Court rejects Trump's efforts to keep records from 1/6 panel,https://news.yahoo.com/court-rejects-trumps-efforts-keep-213553519.html
12/10/2021,"I was outside my house gardening a few weekends ago when a neighbor, whom I had known for almost 30 years, stopped by so I could pet his large, fluffy dogs. I took my gloves off, squatted down to give the dogs a really good scratching around their ears and felt the sun on my back. What could be better? And then my neighbor said: “Why do you have a ‘Black Lives Matter’ sign on your front lawn when all those people do is kill each other?” My lovely day screeched to a halt. “You know I’m Black, right?” I said, standing up as tall as my 5’4” frame would allow, the sun shining on my blond hair. I continued to pet his dogs, because I needed the comfort of petting dogs at that moment, and because I needed to keep my hands busy so they didn’t slap that man’s face. After the usual back and forth of him saying “No!” and me saying “Yes!” and then him trying to gauge exactly “how Black I was” by asking which of my parents was Black and me replying “Both,” we had a very uncomfortable conversation about racism. I told him about my father’s struggles to get an education because guidance counselors and admissions agents would not accept Black people into community colleges or SUNY programs in the 1950s and ’60s. I told him that even though my father was a veteran, he could not be approved to use the GI Bill for college or buy a house, since no one would process his paperwork because he was a Black man. I told him that people painted “Go Home Nigger” on the back of our home when my parents finally saved enough money to build a house in the suburbs of Syracuse, New York. And I told him how “Black Lives Matter” calls attention to the fact that Black people are considered less than white people ― and that needs to stop. I also told him if people don’t understand that Black lives matter, Black people will continue to be murdered by the police and denied opportunities by the establishment. We will not be allowed to participate in the “American Dream,” and we will be made to feel that this is somehow our fault, when it is in fact the fault of a racist society with the full support of our government. This isn’t the first time I’ve had to have this conversation. Encounters like this have been going on for a very long time for me. Both of my parents are Black but have white ancestors. Those recessive white genes were passed on to me, and I was born very light-skinned, with blue eyes and light, wavy hair. This was not a surprise. In both of my parents’ families there are “white” babies who pop up each generation. I have aunts, uncles and cousins on both sides of my family who are also white-presenting. There is the story of my grandmother’s cousin Neville, who left the family in the 1940s to pass for white so he could join the Army and fight in World War II. He married a German girl, returned to Syracuse and never returned to being Black. Family members would see him on the streets and they would look past each other. He was lost to us because he chose an easier way ― and forsook his ancestry. Neville became a cautionary tale for me. I never wanted to be like him. There is also the story of a great-aunt, Annie Mother, who would pass as white to purchase properties and then sell or rent them to Black family members and other Black families who could not find decent, affordable housing. I wanted to be like Annie Mother, so I pursued a career in social justice, specifically issues related to housing. My parents originally tried to purchase a home in Syracuse in the 1960s. Most of the houses they made offers on had deed restrictions that stated the home could not be “sold to Negros.” Determined to own their own home, they decided to build a house, and found some land in a subdivision in Liverpool, New York, where the builder was happy to sell to them. Despite this good news, they soon learned they couldn’t get approved for a mortgage. My dad had a good job at General Electric and my parents had savings, but none of this was enough, because they were Black. My dad accepted a transfer to a position in Alaska, because he could earn double what he’d make in Syracuse. My mom and I moved in with my grandmother for a year and my mom banked all of my dad’s checks. When he returned, my parents paid cash to have their house built in Liverpool. This was the same house on which people painted “Go Home Nigger.” They did this when we already were home ― there was no other “home” to go to. We lived in a white neighborhood, and I went to a school where all the other students were white. Before I started kindergarten, my parents had “the talk” with me. If you don’t know about “the talk,” let me explain it to you. “The talk” is about race. It’s about being Black in a world run by white people, where white people make the rules. In order to survive, let alone thrive, you need to know you are Black and know what that means, even if you present as white. My parents were worried. This was 1969. People knew we were Black, and that I would be starting school in a district where there were no other Black children. I didn’t look Black, but I am Black, so we figured I could and would be subjected to racist actions by my peers. We were prepared for groups of white parents to gather at the school to shout at me. Or spit on me. My parents needed me to understand that if this happened, it didn’t mean I was bad. It meant the adults were bad ― and that I’d need to rise above like Dr. King had done. In our home, Dr. King was whom we strived to be. Even at 4 years old, I knew who he was. I was taught King’s principals of nonviolence. My parents marched on Washington with King and hoped for a better world for me. I set off for school the next day, prepared to walk through a gauntlet of screaming hatred. I was on the lookout. But there didn’t seem to be anything happening. If any protesters had been there, they probably wouldn’t even have known I was Black. With my blond braids and my sparkling new outfit from Sears, I might have walked right by them. I was ready to learn ― and learn I did. But just because there weren’t protesters doesn’t mean there weren’t challenges. My kindergarten teacher did not feel it was appropriate for a Black child to learn and play with white children. She left me inside the classroom on my own while the other students played. I stood by the window and cried. My parents complained to the principal ― a child of Italian immigrants ― and he stepped in. I was then permitted to play with my classmates. Worried that my teacher would not engage me in the same ways she did with the other students, my parents worked with me on my alphabet, math and reading every night after dinner. I excelled. When we moved from Syracuse to Rochester, New York, our new neighborhood was also largely white. I didn’t even find this strange. I fit in and made very good friends, some of whom I am friends with to this day. But I always knew I was Black, and forgetting who I was simply wasn’t an option. In middle school, my history teacher told the class that if we really wanted to insult Black people, we should call them “Uncle Toms.” In high school, one student came dressed as a klansman for Halloween, carrying a noose. Another student, wearing blackface and a loincloth, ran around in front of him. When the few Black students and a number of our white classmates complained to the principal about it, we were told we needed to “develop a sense of humor.” Another student, who would later become a teacher, called me a “white nigger.” I found myself constantly defending affirmative action, busing and desegregation with friends and classmates whose parents thought that if Black people “infested” their white world, chaos would ensue. Many years have passed since then, but sadly, this madness hasn’t stopped. My neighbor, the one who asked me why “Black lives matter,” is not the only one who has felt comfortable asking me such a question or making a statement rife with racism. White people think I am white too, and therefore feel safe saying all kinds of horrible things they might not say publicly. I’ve had people tell me it “disgusts” them to see interracial couples. They’ve told me they don’t understand why Black neighborhoods look so “ghetto,” and that Black people are “animals” or “thugs.” Many of these people are educated, and hold jobs or positions that give them some form of power or influence over Black people. They are doctors, judges, lawyers, social workers and politicians. That’s frightening. In every instance where I’ve encountered racist rhetoric, I have made it my business to speak up. I have told (or reminded) these people that I am Black. I have told them my family’s story. And I have done whatever I could to educate them about the systems of racism that exist in this country. Sometimes they say: “But you’re different!” Then I ask them if other Black folks they know are also “different.” When they say yes, I ask them: “How are all the Black people you know ‘different’? When are you going to realize that we are not different? That you have been misled into believing that Black people are somehow bad, and that what you see with your own eyes ― these Black people you know, and know are not different or bad ― are good people like you?” And that floors them. There is a purposeful and strategic force dedicated to segregation and racism. There are people who benefit from Black people and white people remaining in conflict. When people of different races live together and truly want to know and understand each other, it is harmonious. But when races are separated, it breeds suspicion and distrust. It becomes “us versus them,” and it weakens us as a nation. Living as a Black woman who looks white has allowed me to experience white privilege firsthand. Because people assume I am white, it is assumed I am honest, smart and trustworthy. Many times I have thought to myself: If I looked Black, how would these people treat me? And I have known, without a shadow of a doubt, that I would be treated with disdain or suspicion, or as a criminal. I know in many instances that if I looked Black, the police would have been called to question me. And this sickens and angers me. How many of our Black brothers and sisters have had the police called on them simply for the act of living their lives? As a nation, we need to stop this. The best way to achieve change is to accept and learn about our racist past and the injustices visited upon our Black citizens. It’s deeply concerning that people are protesting the possibility of our country’s history being accurately taught in schools. The only way for America to be great is to accept all of our citizens at face value, and the only way to do that is to understand our intertwined roots ― our history and all the pain and tragedy that exists within it ― and face this, together, head-on.

12/10/2021,"The car of a missing college student and remains have been found in an unsolved case in Georgia. Kyle Clinkscales, 22, went missing in January 1976, and his car was missing until this week. Police also found a wallet and skeletal remains during the investigation. The car of a missing college student and skeletal remains were found in Georgia this week in an unsolved four-decade-old case, authorities said Wednesday. The Troup County Sheriff's Office said in a statement that the car of Kyle Clinkscales was found in Chambers County, Alabama, on Tuesday. A wallet — with identification and credit cards — and skeletal remains were also recovered at the site, police said at a news conference. Clinkscales had been missing since January 27, 1976, when he disappeared after leaving a bar in western Georgia to drive back to Auburn University in Auburn, Alabama. He was 22 at the time. His car was found on Tuesday by Chambers County deputies, who were notified of a submerged vehicle in a creek, the Troup County Sheriff's Office said. Deputies from Chambers County contacted the Troup County Sheriff's Office, just over the border in Georgia, after pulling the car from the water and identifying the Georgia license plates. The car's identification matched the 1974 Ford Pinto Runabout that Clinkscales was last seen driving, the Troup County Sheriff's Office said. The car ""is currently being processed by Special Agents with the GBI to determine the contents of the vehicle,"" the Troup County Sheriff's Office said.

12/10/2021,"A former cadet who was expelled from the U.S. Coast Guard Academy after becoming a father filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday challenging the school's policy that prohibits students from being parents. Isaak Olson was two months from graduating from the academy in 2014 with a degree in mechanical engineering and a commission as an officer when he disclosed that his fiancee had given birth to their first child several months earlier, according the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Connecticut.  The academy expelled Olson under a regulation that requires cadets to either resign or be “disenrolled” if they incur a “parental obligation” from a pregnancy over 14 weeks, according to the lawsuit. “The decision to become a parent is deeply personal, and no school or job should be able to interfere with that choice,” Elana Bildner, an ACLU of Connecticut staff attorney representing Olson, said in a statement. “The U.S. Coast Guard Academy’s archaic regulation, which forces cadets to choose between parenthood and their degrees, has been morally wrong and unconstitutional since its inception.” The ban was introduced in the late 1970s, just after the academy began admitting women, Bildner said.  “It is likely no accident that the academy instituted its arcane ban on parenthood only after it began admitting women,” she said. ""This policy has no place in Connecticut or elsewhere, and it must end.” Messages were left Wednesday seeking comment from both the school and the Coast Guard. Olson learned of his fiancee's pregnancy in April of his junior year, according to the lawsuit. She decided not to have an abortion and he decided not to resign because that would have meant allowing the academy to recoup the cost of his education, estimated at up to $500,000, according to the lawsuit.  His fiancee gave birth in August 2013. Olson disclosed that he had a child on a duty screening application in March 2014, which was the first time he had been asked about dependents, according to the lawsuit.  The couple, in an effort to resolve the matter and allow him to graduate, had Olson's parental rights terminated, according to his attorneys. The couple is now married with two children, according to the lawsuit.  He was never given a hearing and was “disenrolled” from the academy, according to the lawsuit. He decided to sue after going through a lengthy administrative process in a effort to get his status restored, Bildner said.  Olson enlisted in the Coast Guard shortly after his expulsion and is currently an aviation maintenance technician stationed in Alaska. He is seeking his commission and back pay as part of the lawsuit. The academy ultimately did not seek to recoup the cost of his education. Olson and his family receive about $3,000 less per month than they would have if he had been granted his commission as an officer, according to the lawsuit.  The case is expected to have implications at other service academies,  which have similar policies, according to the ACLU. “We believe such bans are wrong for every military service academy and that the academies should strike them from their regulations,"" said Linda Morris, a staff attorney with the ACLU Women’s Rights Project. A bill introduced in the U.S. Senate this summer by Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, would mandate an end to policies that force students in military academies to withdraw or give up their children if they become pregnant.  “This policy is unfair, antiquated, and unacceptable,” Cruz said at the time. Under the bill, military academies would treat pregnancies in line with the rest of the military.",U.S./Associated Press,Expelled Coast Guard cadet sues over policy banning parents,https://news.yahoo.com/expelled-coast-guard-cadet-sues-215523545.html
12/10/2021,"Courtesy Carol Buckley An 11-year custody battle for an elephant named Tarra recently ended at the Tennessee Supreme Court. Tarra is back with Carol Buckley, the animal's original caretaker and owner, who first met Tarra in 1974 when the elephant was an 800-pound baby. ""She's home, she's safe, she's under my care again — and forever this time,"" Buckley tells PEOPLE. Before their recent reunion, Buckley and her 8-foot tall, 9,500-pound elephant had only seen each other twice since 2010 — the year Buckley was fired by the board of The Elephant Sanctuary in Hohenwald, Tennessee, which Buckley co-founded in 1995. At the time, Buckley convinced herself that somehow she would be reinstated, but she wasn't. Several months later, she filed suit for visitation with Tarra, which later changed to custody after most of the elephant caretakers she knew left the sanctuary. This November, legal appeals by The Elephant Sanctuary were exhausted, and the high court confirmed Buckley as the rightful owner of Tarra, who Buckley reunited with on November 18th. On that day, 47-year-old Tarra was loaded onto a trailer so that Buckley could drive her to her new home, Elephant Refuge North America — which Buckley founded after departing The Elephant Sanctuary. Elephant Refuge North America sits on 850 acres in Attapulgus, Georgia. An overwhelmed and enraged Tarra didn't immediately respond to seeing her original owner again while being loaded into the trailer, a process that took four hours. ""She would be dangerous if she didn't recognize me,"" Buckley shares. ""I needed to be careful. On that 10 hour drive, I was making my plan of what I would do and how I would do it."" They arrived at Elephant Refuge North America at 11 p.m. Buckley opened the gate on Tarra's trailer a little bit and moved away to an area where she could get to safety if needed. Tarra pushed the trailer door all the way open. ""As she took a couple of steps down. I said, 'Hey hun, it's me. You're home now,' and she looked at me, her eyes popped, and she just started talking her Tarra talk,"" Buckley describes the moment of Tarra's homecoming. ""She comes down the ramp, looks around, she's smelling, she comes over to me, and I say, 'Honey, you can't touch me yet because I am afraid. I saw how you looked 10 hours ago. You looked like a monster, and you've got to give me a minute to accept that this is not dangerous.' "" Courtesy Carol Buckley  Buckley walked into the elephant's new habitat, and Tarra followed her. They went over to greet Bo, another elephant in the sanctuary standing behind his fence. He reached his trunk over to Tarra. ""They're both talking together, and I'm standing 5 feet away. She turns to me, she gives me this big ol' Tarra smile with big eyes, and she raises her trunk out like an arm around my waist, she pulls me to her chest, and she just starts rumbling, like a cat purr. And I just start crying because this is it. This is my Tarra. Everything's fine, our relationship is not damaged, this is really good,"" Buckley adds of the moment. ""At that point, all is forgiven,"" she says of the protracted legal battle. ""None of that matters. She's home with me. She's got a dog here that loves her. And Bo, he's such a gentleman. He's easy with her. The whole thing is just magic."" RELATED: Former Circus Elephants Find New Home at North Florida Sanctuary: 'An Incredible Moment' The two elephants have become buddies, and others can delight in their friendship by watching the refuge's EleCam. Tarra and Buckley's story started when Buckley was an 18-year-old freshman at Moorpark College Exotic Animal Training and Management in Moorpark, California. Buckley was working on her studies when she noticed an elephant walking in front of her rental house, a jute rope tied around the animal's neck. The man walking the elephant turned out to be the owner of a tire store chain that used the animal for advertising and publicity. Courtesy Carol Buckley  Buckley volunteered to come to the tire store to take care of the elephant, then called Fluffy. With only dog training experience and a past internship with a sea lion trainer, Buckley began training the baby elephant. She turned it into a job and dropped out of school. She later spoke up about bettering the elephant's care at the tire store; she was rebuffed. Buckley took out a loan with her parents as co-signers to buy the elephant in 1976 for $25,000. To feed her elephant, Buckley needed 20 pounds of produce, grains, and hay every day, so she made a deal with local grocery stores to take their imperfect fruits and vegetables. Renaming the elephant Tarra, Buckley performed with the elephant for eight years in circus shows and then did educational programs and offered elephant rides at zoos in summers for 12 years. Throughout it all, Tarra's intelligence was evident. One day Buckley put a paintbrush in Tarra's trunk. The elephant happily painted an abstract picture that appeared, upon closer inspection, to include letters from her name. Buckley also trained Tarra for Hollywood. She appeared in 1982's Annie as the rollerskating elephant Carol Burnett rides and had other roles in film and commercials. Courtesy Carol Buckley  ""She was a kid, and it was fun,"" Buckley says of Tarra's rollerskating Annie role. ""They're no different than human children. They want to have fun. They just happen to be quite a bit larger. She was precocious and trusted me and was willing to try something."" When Tarra turned 21, the elephant age of adulthood, Buckley wanted a place for Tarra to live where she could roam freely, doing whatever she pleased without being on public display or performing. Buckley couldn't find such a place, so she bought a 112-acre farm in Hohenwald, Tennessee, for Tarra. Two years later, she and a co-founder formed The Elephant Sanctuary, a nonprofit dedicated to helping captive animals, which grew to be over 2,000 acres. Tarra was joined at the sanctuary by other elephants ready to retire and those rescued from abuse. These other animals became Tarra's friends. RELATED: New Documentary Shows How Cher Helped the World's Loneliest Elephant Find Freedom and Friends The Elephant Sanctuary cited those friendships to explain why they went through such lengths to keep Tarra after Buckley left. ""Over the decades at The Sanctuary, Tarra has developed relationships with many other elephants,"" CEO Janice Zeitlin said in a statement to PEOPLE. ""Tarra and Sissy have been together at The Sanctuary for 21 years, and their special relationship has been well documented. It is recognized that elephants become strongly bonded to other elephants. The Elephant Sanctuary embraces the role as protector of these elephants and is committed to supporting their opportunities to bond with other elephants and to provide them the stability of lifetime care without the threat of loss of home and long-standing elephant relationships."" While Tarra has left the bonds from The Elephant Sanctuary behind, she has rekindled her deep friendship with Buckley and started new relationships with Elephant Refuge North America's residents. Buckley, 67, is thrilled to have Tarra back in her life.

12/10/2021,"The House Select Committee to Investigate the Jan. 6 Attack on the Capitol on Thursday released slides from a PowerPoint calling for former President Trump to declare a national security emergency in order to delay the certification of the results of the 2020 election. The presentation, headlined was referred to in an email provided to the committee by Mark Meadows, the former White House chief of staff who’s had a rough couple of weeks, to say the least. The revelation is the latest piece of evidence that Trump and his inner circle, including his allies in Congress, were very actively and very aggressively trying to overturn the results of the election, which Trump lost handily. More from Rolling Stone Yet Another Court Rejects Trump's Desperate Attempt to Block Jan. 6 Committee from Seeing White House Records Big Law Firms Promised to Punish Republicans Who Voted to Overthrow Democracy. Now They're Donating to their Campaigns Mark Meadows Discussed a 'Direct and Collateral Attack' Plan to Overturn Election Results, Committee Says The PowerPoint presentation, which spanned 38 pages and was titled “Election fraud, Foreign Interference & Options for 6 JAN,” was part of an email sent on Jan. 5, the day before the attack on the Capitol. The email pertained to a briefing that was to be provided “on the hill.” Hugo Lowell of The Guardian tweeted slides from the presentation on Thursday detailing a conspiracy theory-laden plan for Vice President Pence to install Republican electors in states “where fraud occurred,” and for Trump to declare a national emergency and for all electronic voting to be rendered invalid, citing foreign “control” of electronic voting systems. In the 13 months since the election, no evidence has emerged that foreign entities influenced the election, or that any significant fraud occurred. The release of the PowerPoint slides laying out options to overthrow democracy comes a day after the committee noted in a letter that Meadows had provided text messages in which he discussed a “highly controversial” plan to overturn the election results by appointing alternate electors in certain states. “I love it,” Meadows replied to the idea, which was sent to him by a lawmaker. Meadows discussed the same plan, which was described as a “direct and collateral attack,” in a separate email. The letter referenced the PowerPoint presentation, as well, but did not provide details of its contents. The letter sent on Wednesday, which was addressed to Meadows’ attorney, explained that the committee had “no choice” but to move to hold Meadows in contempt of Congress for his refusal to comply with his subpoena. How, if Meadows is refusing to comply, did the committee get ahold of all of these damning documents from the former chief of staff? Meadows last week reached an agreement to cooperate, turned over the material, and then earlier this week changed his mind and is now stonewalling the committee. He’s now suing the committee in an attempt to block his subpoena. It’s unclear what exactly inspired the reversal. Meadows says the committee was not respecting his claims of executive privilege, to which Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) said the committee “tried repeatedly to identify with specificity the areas of inquiry” were subject to privilege, but Meadows wouldn’t cooperate. It’s also possible that Meadows decided to buck the committee after reports began to circulate that Trump was pissed at him for revealing a bunch of damning information about how the White House covered up details of Trump’s bout with Covid last year. It’s also possible that Meadows just isn’t very bright. Regardless, the committee is now in possession of a trove of his documents indicating the extent of Trumpworld’s very real efforts to overturn the election results, efforts that culminated in a throng of supporters storming the Capitol in a violent attack that resulted in five deaths and dozens of injured police officers. The material turned over by Meadows may be the tip of the iceberg. Committee Vice Chair Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) said last week that the committee is preparing to hold “several weeks” worth of public hearings that will tell the story of the riot at the Capitol in “vivid color.” She added on Thursday that the committee has met with nearly 300 witnesses, that it is conducting multiple depositions and interviews every week, and that it expects a ruling imminently on whether it can obtain Trump’s White House documents. “The investigation is firing on all cylinders,” she wrote. Hours after Cheney teased an upcoming ruling on Trump’s executive privilege claim, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals struck it down.

State troopers and social services launched an investigation in November after investigators learned that the girl had given birth in March, the Kentucky State Police said Wednesday in a news release. Authorities said the 34-year-old father sold his daughter to a 20-year-old man in August 2020 and the girl had been living with him since then. The younger man was charged with third-degree rape. Police did not release the girl's age. The two Beaver Dam men were booked into the Ohio County Detention Center. They’re both being held on $50,000 bonds, jail records show.

12/10/2021,"A newly approved eye drop hitting the market on Thursday could change the lives of millions of Americans with age-related blurred near vision, a condition affecting mostly people 40 and older. Vuity, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in October, would potentially replace reading glasses for some of the 128 million Americans who have trouble seeing close-up. The new medicine takes effect in about 15 minutes, with one drop on each eye providing sharper vision for six to 10 hours, according to the company. Toni Wright, one of the 750 participants in a clinical trial to test the drug, said she liked what she saw. ""It's definitely a life changer,"" Wright told CBS News national correspondent Jericka Duncan. Before the trial, the only way Wright could see things clearly was by keeping reading glasses everywhere — in her office, bathroom, kitchen and car.  ""I was in denial because to me that was a sign of growing older, you know, needing to wear glasses,"" she said.  It was in 2019 that her doctor told her about a new eye drop with the potential to correct her vision problems, temporarily. The 54-year-old online retail consultant, who works from her farm in western Pennsylvania, instantly noticed a difference. ""I would not need my readers as much, especially on the computer, where I would always need to have them on,"" she said. Vuity is the first FDA-approved eye drop to treat age-related blurry near vision, also known as presbyopia. The prescription drug utilizes the eye's natural ability to reduce its pupil size, said Dr. George Waring, the principal investigator for the trial. ""Reducing the pupil size expands the depth of field or the depth of focus, and that allows you to focus at different ranges naturally,"" he said. A 30-day supply of the drug will cost about $80 and works best in people 40 to 55 years old, a Vuity spokesperson said. Side effects detected in the three-month trial included headaches and red eyes, the company said.  ""This is something that we anticipate will be well tolerated long term, but this will be evaluated and studied in a formal capacity,"" Waring said. Vuity is by no means a cure-all, and the maker does caution against using the drops when driving at night or performing activities in low-light conditions. The drops are for mild to intermediate cases and are less effective after age 65, as eyes age. Users may also have temporary difficulty in adjusting focus between objects near and far. As of now, the drug is not covered by insurance. Doctors who spoke with CBS News said it's unlikely that insurance will ever cover it because it's not ""medically necessary,"" as glasses are still a less expensive alternative. For Wright and millions just like her, the new drug is an easy backup solution — with a clear advantage.  ""Just a convenience to have that option of putting the drops in and being able to go,"" she said.

12/10/2021,"Leaders of several large retailers sent a letter to Congress to ask it to address organized retail crime. Criminal retail rings have cost companies like Target, CVS Health, and Home Depot billions of dollars a year in stolen merchandise. The letter cites ""lack of transparency"" in third-party marketplaces as a main factor enabling the criminal retail activity. Leaders in the retail industry are fed-up with organized retail crime's impact on their businesses, and they're asking Congress to take action. Twenty CEOs at major retailers sent a letter addressed to Congressional leadership on Thursday, asking lawmakers to pass legislation to help curb illegal business activity by anonymous vendors online. Retailers say they have seen an uptick in organized criminal activity over the past months, including through brazen smash and grab thefts, and many stolen brick-and-mortar products being resold on online marketplace platforms. The retail industry has lost billions in the past year from the reselling of these ""hot"" items, according to the FBI and a 2020 survey from the National Retail Federation. Signatories include the CEOs of Target, CVS Health, Rite Aid, Home Depot, Dollar General, AutoZone, Kroger Co., Petco, Ulta Beauty, Nordstrom, Best Buy, as well as the president of the Retail Industry Leaders Association. In the letter, the business leaders point to the ""anonymity of the Internet"" and the ""failure of certain marketplaces"" to verify their sellers as causes for the criminal retail practices.  ""In the current environment, criminal networks and unscrupulous businesses have exploited a system that protects their anonymity to sell unsafe, stolen, or counterfeit products with little legal recourse,"" the letter reads. ""This lack of transparency on particular third-party marketplaces has allowed criminal activity to fester."" The CEOs want Congress to support a bipartisan bill that would force online marketplaces to authenticate ""high-volume third-party sellers."" The bill, called the Integrity Notification and Fairness in Online Retail Marketplaces (INFORM) for Consumers Act, would make it harder for bad sellers to hide behind fake screen names and false business information when fencing illicit products, the letter said.  However, some groups, like the Makers and Merchants Coalition, a trade group representing third-party online sellers, have spoken out against the INFORM Act, saying the act helps eliminate competition from big-box retailers, a spokesperson for the coalition previously told Insider. The retail leaders do not explicitly name third-party marketplace platforms in the letter, but multiple ecommerce sites have pushed back on claims that they don't do enough to monitor illegal activity on their platforms. Amazon introduced a live video and physical address verification method last year, allowing the company to verify sellers' identities with their government-issued IDs, the company told Insider. The company also said it came out in support for the INFORM for Consumers Act in October.  ""Amazon does not allow third-party sellers to list stolen goods in our store, and we work closely with law enforcement, retailers, and brands to stop bad actors and hold them accountable, including withholding funds, terminating accounts, and making law enforcement referrals,"" an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement to Insider. ""We regularly request invoices, purchase orders, or other proofs of sourcing when we have concerns about how a seller may have obtained particular products that they want to sell."" Facebook Marketplace prohibits the sale of stolen items in accordance to their Commerce Policies. The platform responds to valid legal requests and may also share information with law enforcement, in line with its terms, and regulators in cases where it may prevent fraud or other types of illegal activity, a Meta spokesperson told Insider. Insider also reached out to eBay for comment, but the online commerce platform has not yet responded.

12/10/2021,"Body-camera footage captured Kim Potter's response after she shot Daunte Wright in April. ""Oh, shit. I shot him,"" Potter could be heard saying. ""I grabbed the wrong fucking gun."" The former officer faces first- and second-degree manslaughter charges. Body-camera footage played in court during the first day of the Kimberly Potter trial showed the former Brooklyn Center officer collapsing on the ground after fatally shooting 20-year-old Daunte Wright in April. Opening statements took place on Wednesday in the Hennepin County Government Center in Minneapolis, where Potter, a white woman, is charged with first- and second-degree manslaughter for the shooting of Wright, a Black man, during a traffic stop earlier this year. Officers initially pulled Wright over for an expired registration tag on his car, but they attempted to detain him after discovering an outstanding warrant for a gross misdemeanor weapons charge, authorities said. Potter has pleaded not guilty to both charges, arguing that she accidentally deployed her gun instead of her Taser, which was holstered on the other side of her body. Her defense argued on Wednesday that Potter attempted to stun Wright because he was ""trying to kill her partner,"" Sgt. Mychal Johnson. But Anthony Luckey, the Brooklyn Center officer whom Potter was training at the time of the shooting and who was at the scene, contradicted the defense's approach. He testified that Wright gave police no reason to believe he had a gun and didn't threaten responding officers. While questioning Luckey on Wednesday, the prosecution played never-before-seen body-camera footage from the moments immediately following the shooting. ""Oh, shit. I shot him,"" Potter could be heard saying in footage from her camera. ""I grabbed the wrong fucking gun."" A separate video taken from Luckey's body-camera showed Potter falling to the ground. ""Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God,"" Potter could be heard saying as she hyperventilated. The officer kept her face buried in the curbside grass for minutes following the shooting, the video showed. ""Just breathe,"" Luckey said. ""I'm going to prison,"" Potter responded. ""No, you're not,"" Luckey said. ""Kim, that guy was trying to take off with me in the car!"" Johnson could be heard saying in the video. The footage showed both Luckey and Johnson reaching down to Potter as she lay on the curb. Following Luckey's testimony, the court wrapped for the day. The case, in which Potter is expected to testify, is scheduled to resume on Thursday morning.

12/10/2021,"South Carolina’s top prosecutor Alan Wilson reportedly met Thursday with Kyle Rittenhouse, who in November was acquitted on charges for shooting three men, killing two of them during protests over police brutality in Kenosha, Wisconsin. WIS-TV reporter Adam Mintzer tweeted photos Thursday of Attorney General Wilson eating lunch with Rittenhouse at Maurice’s Piggie Park BBQ on Elmwood Avenue near downtown Columbia. Mintzer also tweeted a video of the two walking, adding Wilson said they were “just getting lunch.” Another man seen with Rittenhouse told Mintzer he was “meeting with his attorney,” according to Mintzer. Rittenhouse was acquitted of his charges in November after he argued he fired at the three men in self-defense after he was attacked. “He wants to get on with his life,” defense attorney Mark Richards said after Rittenhouse was acquitted. “He has a huge sense of relief for what the jury did to him today. He wishes none of this ever happened. But as he said when he testified, he did not start this.” The State has reached out to the Attorney General’s Office for comment.

12/10/2021,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — A California woman was criminally charged Thursday after authorities said she told her basketball athlete daughter to “hit her” before the girl punched an opposing player in the head during a game. The punch was allegedly thrown last month as two club teams played during a tournament in the city of Garden Grove near Los Angeles. Latira Shonty Hunt was caught on cell phone video yelling “you better hit her for that” after her daughter fell to the ground on a previous play involving the victim, said Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer. The blow crumpled the 15-year-old victim “to the floor like a rag doll,” Spitzer said. The girl suffered a concussion, according to her family's lawyer. Hunt, 44, is charged with two misdemeanors: contributing to the delinquency of a minor and battery. She faces up to a year in jail if convicted, Spitzer said. Contact information for Hunt could not be found and it wasn't immediately known if she has an attorney who could speak on her behalf. “In my opinion it would have not happened, but for mom's words,” Spitzer said of the attack. He said Hunt's words “were the catalyst” that caused her daughter “to even think about” punching the other girl. Youth sports in America are replete with examples of parents acting badly at games. Usually it involves taunts or other harsh language, often directed at officials. Viral videos periodically emerge of fathers or mothers charging onto playing fields or courts and assaulting referees, coaches or players. While those cases can bring charges, legal experts said it is very rare for a parent’s comment from the stands to produce a criminal case. Richard Kaplan, a Los Angeles defense attorney not involved with this case, called the charges against Hunt “a stretch.” Kaplan predicted that it will be difficult for prosecutors to prove that Hunt's outburst was a command and not just “an emotional response in a heated moment.” The girl who threw the punch is the daughter of former NBA player Corey Benjamin, who issued an apology shortly after he saw the video of the game. His pro career included stints with the Chicago Bulls, the Atlanta Hawks and overseas teams. “As a father, I’m shocked and disappointed at my daughter’s behavior as this is not a reflection of the values and standards that my family holds. Nor does it exemplify the values, character and spirit of sportsmanship that the game of basketball requires,” Benjamin said in a statement at the time. The alleged victim's lawyer, Kevin Hahn, said the family is “pleased with the DA’s decision to charge the mother. We think it’s warranted given the facts."" Spitzer said the punch came following a physical turnover play during which Hunt's daughter tried to block a shot and the other girl fell to the ground after attempting to score. “The ball now has changed hands and they’re going back to the other basket,” Spitzer said, and that's when he said Hunt encouraged her daughter to hit the other girl. Spitzer added that he is the parent of two student-athletes and has witnessed plenty parents yelling and screaming from the stands, but not to the point of instigating an attack. “I’ve never seen a parent encourage another child who is competing against my kid or any other player to engage in violence,” he said. If prosecutors are unable to prove that Hunt has a history of similar behavior, Kaplan said a judge might choose to dismiss the case and order Hunt into a diversion program, such as anger management classes. “Obviously it was an inappropriate thing to say, but was it really intended to cause harm?""

12/10/2021,"Last week in the sex-trafficking trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, defense attorney Jeff Pagliuca made a show of remembering to respect an alleged victim’s request for anonymity. He had just begun discussing the first accuser, known only by the pseudonym “Jane” while cross-examining Jeffrey Epstein’s former estate staff member Juan Alessi. Judge Alison Nathan broke in with a reminder to not say Jane’s real name out loud. Pagliuca told the judge not to worry. “I have it blacked out on all my copies,” he said, referring to the documents in front of him. Nathan replied that she was also providing the reminder for the benefit of Alessi, who was less familiar with the process. Then Pagliuca read from the document in front of him and promptly spoke Jane’s real first name out loud. Today, he did it again. In open court, he uttered the real last name of Carolyn, the third of four accusers to testify for the state, who tearfully recounted testimony of being abused by Epstein and Maxwell starting when she was 14, and whom counsel had agreed to refer to by her first name only. Prosecutors immediately complained to the judge.

Ppl are now learning a victim's true identity. — kate briquelet (@kbriquelet) December 7, 2021 Attorney Adam Horowitz, who represented eight Epstein victims in a Florida civil suit around 2009, thinks that’s one occasion too many to be a slip of the tongue. “It’s one of those things where the first time maybe it’s a mistake,” he says. “The second time, there’s a pattern now that something is being done purposefully, which is disturbing, because there’s a court order that he’s not allowed to use the name.” (Pagliuca did not immediately respond for comment; we will update if he does.) Horowitz says that if the revelation of the alleged victims’ names is an intentional attempt to expose or embarrass them, it isn’t working. “Thankfully, no major media outlets have reported the name,” he says. “So it’s not an effective strategy.” But total secrecy isn’t the biggest concern. After all, Jane’s provided enough detail about her career and upbringing that it isn’t impossible to suss out her identity — the issue is the betrayal of trust of alleged victims who have agreed to cooperate with the prosecution of an alleged sex-trafficker by telling a jury, a courtroom, and overflow rooms full of invisible strangers the painful details of what they claim happened to them.  To Horowitz, that broken agreement could have troubling ramifications. “As a lawyer, what I’m concerned about is the chilling factor, where victims and whistleblowers decide they’re not going to come forward because a defense lawyer might out their names,” Horowitz says. “We rely on whistleblowers and other victims to come forward; sometimes they provide helpful evidence.

12/10/2021,"COVID-19 hospitalizations are once again rising in the United States. Among the 30-plus states that have seen increases in COVID-19 hospitalizations over the last two weeks, six stand out. Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, New York and Illinois have accounted for the majority of the country’s increase in hospital beds filled, according to an NBC News analysis of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services data. Full coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic While these states make up 35 percent of the population among states with increasing COVID-19 hospitalizations, they make up 60 percent of the added beds, the analysis showed. The nationwide increase began in early November, when the U.S. was averaging about 45,000 hospitalizations per day. It has since ticked up to nearly 58,000 per day, according to the analysis. Health experts say they fear hospitalizations could continue to surge this winter as more Americans head indoors and the fast-moving delta variant continues to spread.

Health experts say they fear hospitalizations could continue to surge this winter as more Americans head indoors and the fast-moving delta variant continues to spread. Since HHS began tracking COVID-19 hospitalizations in early 2020, the U.S. has crossed the 50,000 mark five times. Delta’s first hospitalization surge this summer saw a peak of more than 100,000 hospitalizations, on average, and last winter’s surge peaked at more than 137,000 hospitalizations, on average. While much of the world is focused on the new omicron variant, first identified in South Africa, delta is still a threat, as “over 99 percent of sequenced cases in the United States continue to be from” that strain, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Tuesday at a White House COVID-19 Response Team briefing. Hospitalizations in Michigan, which has the highest share of new hospitalizations when adjusted for population, are up 70 percent since Nov. 10. In the neighboring states of Indiana and Illinois, hospitalizations have almost doubled. In Michigan, 3 of 4 COVID-19 patients are unvaccinated, according to Chelsea Wuth, an associate public information officer at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. Unvaccinated people make up 87 percent of COVID-19 patients who are in an intensive care unit in the state, she said, and 88 percent of COVID-19 patients who are on a ventilator are unvaccinated. More than 70 percent Michiganders age 16 and older have had at least one shot of a Covid vaccine, she said. Dr. Matthew Sims, a physician and director of infectious disease research at Beaumont Health, the state’s largest health care system, said “almost all” the COVID-19 patients coming in are unvaccinated. Roughly 600 patients are sickened with COVID-19 across the system as of Tuesday, he said, noting the staff is exhausted. “We’ve been doing this for so long,” he said. “It does get tiring to the nurses, the doctors, everybody when we see this huge number of patients that are all coming in that are not vaccinated.” Since HHS began tracking COVID-19 hospitalizations in early 2020, the U.S. has crossed the 50,000 mark five times.

Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff, director of Ohio’s Department of Health, said during a news conference that cases aren’t occurring evenly among age groups. Young people, particularly those between the ages of 23 and 49, have a case rate that’s 25 percent higher than the statewide average, he said. As in Michigan, the vast majority of hospitalized patients in Ohio are unvaccinated, Vanderhoff said. State officials continue to urge people to get vaccinated. Doing so would help hospitals in the state as they face staffing challenges. “Almost every hospital really doesn’t have the elasticity that maybe we had this time last year to really expand capacity on a short-term notice when there’s a flood or surge in local patients,” Dr. Andy Thomas, with Ohio State University’s Wexner Medical Center, said at the same briefing. “If these trends continue through the month of December into January, we will be at a point where the hospitals in Ohio will not be able to take care of all the patients we need to take care of.” Last week, in the state of New York, home to the fifth largest share of new hospitalizations, Gov. Kathy Hochul announced that hospitals with less than 10 percent capacity must stop doing elective surgeries until at least Jan. 15, 2020. There are around 50 hospitals that meet that criteria, the vast majority of which are upstate, Hochul said during a press conference last Thursday. Dr. Celine Gounder, an infectious disease specialist at NYU Langone Health in New York City, said people may be getting tired as the country approaches two years into the pandemic. People “think in terms of personal action, personal responsibility, personal freedom, and unfortunately that’s not how viruses transmit and infect,” she said.

12/10/2021,"TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — A once-standout U.S. narcotics agent who used his badge to build a lavish lifestyle of expensive cars, parties on yachts and Tiffany jewels was sentenced to more than 12 years in federal prison Thursday for conspiring to launder money with a Colombian cartel. But even as José Irizarry admitted to his crimes, he blamed former colleagues at the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration for fostering a culture of corruption that desensitized him to the implications of violating the law. “When my client joined the DEA he was schooled in how to be corrupt, he was schooled in how to break the law,"" his attorney, María Dominguez, said in court. “In this alternate universe it became easier and less suspect to accept money and gifts"" from criminal informants who worked with the U.S. premier narcotics agency. U.S. District Court Judge Charlene Honeywell in handing down her sentence expressed disgust with the DEA for its failings and said other agents corrupted by “the allure of easy money” also needed to be investigated. ""This has to stop,” the judge said. “You were the one who got caught but it is apparent to this court that there are others.” The DEA did not respond to requests for comment on Irizarry's claims. “Former Special Agent Irizarry abused the trust of the American people when he repeatedly violated his oath as a federal law enforcement officer,” Anne Milgram, the agency's new administrator, said in a statement. “Bringing him to justice reflects the principles of those who faithfully serve and uphold the values of DEA.” Irizarry’s allegations underscore the porous oversight he received during his career, in which he was entrusted with the government’s use of front companies, shell bank accounts and couriers to combat international drug trafficking. They also raise new questions about whether his colleagues in the Miami field office, where Irizarry’s criminal activity began, similarly abused the badge in their handling of confidential informants who every year move tens of millions of dollars in dirty money under the DEA's supervision. Dominguez in court filings revealed that since Irizarry's arrest last year he has met with prosecutors for “endless hours” to provide information on the criminal activities of “fellow law-enforcement agents who initiated him in a life of crime.” Honeywell recently sealed “sensitive” documents filed in the criminal case, saying making their disclosure could potentially impede an ongoing criminal investigation, cause targets to flee and hinder cooperation from other witnesses. So far, other than Irizarry's wife, Nathalia Gomez-Irizarry, and a Colombian customs worker, nobody else has been charged in the conspiracy. The U.S. Justice Department's Inspector General slammed the DEA  in a report over the summer for failing to properly oversee what are supposed to be tightly monitored stings of the sort Irizarry worked on. As a result of the rebuke, which came on the heels of a string of scandals involving agents overseas, Milgram ordered an outside review of the agency's foreign operations, which is ongoing. The DEA has been shaken by repeated cases of misconduct in recent years, including agents charged with wire fraud, bribery and selling firearms to drug traffickers. Thursday’s hearing came just four months after another longtime DEA agent, Chad Scott, was sentenced to more than 13 years behind bars for stealing money from suspects, falsifying government records and committing perjury. The DEA hired Irizarry, 47, and allowed him to handle sensitive financial transactions even after he failed a polygraph exam, declared bankruptcy and kept close ties to a suspected money launderer who would go on to become the godfather of the agent's twin daughters with his Colombian wife. He pleaded guilty last year to 19 federal counts, including bank fraud, admitting he parlayed his expertise in money laundering into a life of luxury that prosecutors said was bankrolled by $9 million he and his co-conspirators diverted from undercover money laundering investigations. The spoils included a $30,000 Tiffany diamond ring for his wife, luxury sports cars and a $767,000 home in the Caribbean resort city of Cartagena — on top of residences in south Florida and Puerto Rico. Before he resigned in 2018, Irizarry’s ostentatious habits and tales of raucous yacht parties had become well known among DEA agents and prosecutors with whom they worked. To further the scheme, prosecutors said, Irizarry filed false reports and ordered DEA staff to wire money slated for undercover stings to international accounts he and associates controlled. The money should’ve been carefully tracked by the DEA as part of undercover money laundering investigations, prosecutors said. Irizarry has claimed the bank accounts in question amounted to a profit-producing “slush fund” for official and personal travel of federal law enforcement, U.S. prosecutors and confidential sources. Dominguez said Irizarry accepted full responsibility for his actions but that his take of the conspiracy never surpassed $600,000. At Thursday's sentencing, Irizarry broke down in tears as he addressed the court, saying the biggest punishment was not being able to explain to his two young daughters why he would be going away for so long. He said when he became a federal law enforcement agent two decades ago he did so with a sense of great pride. “Unfortunately, there came a time when I made a decision that went against the person who I was, that damaged my wife and embarrassed my country,"" he said. “I should’ve known better and I didn’t. I failed.” __ Mustian reported from New Orleans.",U.S./Associated Press,DEA agent gets 12 years for conspiring with Colombian cartel,https://news.yahoo.com/dea-agent-gets-12-years-223419309.html
12/10/2021,"A Chinese spokesperson railed against the US' diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympics. The US had announced the boycott in response to Beijing's ""ongoing genocide"" of the Uyghur minority. Zhao Lijian fired back by accusing the US of committing ""evil crimes"" against Native Americans. China's foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian lashed out at the US on Tuesday for its diplomatic boycott of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, saying that allegations of genocide — which China faces over its treatment of the Uyghur minority in Xinjiang — ""fits the US better than anyone else"" for its treatment of Native Americans. ""The US has been fabricating the biggest lie of the century about so-called 'genocide' in Xinjiang, but it has long been debunked by facts,"" Zhao said, though he declined to specify what facts. He said the diplomatic boycott, which the White House announced on Monday citing ""ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity"" by Beijing, is based on ""ideological biases as well as lies and rumors."" Zhao denounced the US for committing ""evil crimes"" against Native Americans and said that the boycott ""gravely violates"" the political neutrality for which the Olympic Games are known. He said US officials hadn't even been invited to the games in the first place, repeating a similar statement he made earlier this week when rumors of the boycott began to surface. ""The US political agenda wins no support and is doomed to fail,"" he added. Australia, the UK, and Canada have since joined the US in the boycott, which will still allow their athletes to compete while their diplomatic representatives stay home. Other Chinese diplomats have ridiculed the US boycott, saying President Joe Biden was ""flattering himself"" to assume US officials had been invited to the Winter Olympics. Zhao has consistently decried frequent reports that China has been detaining hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs and people from other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, breaking up families, and attempting to erase their cultures and religious loyalty. Many Uyghurs have been forced to work in labor camps picking cotton.

A neighbor took a Facebook Live video of the baby — found in Memphis — showing the newborn’s umbilical cord was still attached, according to Fox13. Police, which received a call about the baby about 4 p.m. on Wednesday, Dec. 8, said the baby was taken to Le Bonheur Children’s Hospital in non-critical condition, the TV station reported. Local residents expressed shock when they heard about the baby, and one told WREG Memphis they were grateful the child was safe. “I’ve never seen it myself personally. I’ve only heard stories of babies left in trash cans and things and such but not so close to where you are everyday,” neighbor Edison Hagan told the TV station. Action News 5 reported that when the two teenage girls found the baby on the ground, the child was only wearing a piece of cloth around its waist and the temperature was about 56 degrees. The Memphis Police Department told Action News 5 that there would be no charges filed against the mother, who had been located after the baby was found outside the apartment complex. McClatchy News reached out to the Memphis Police Department and did not immediately receive a response. The incident also sparked a larger conversation among the community and law enforcement about infant Safe Haven laws in the state. Later on the evening of Dec. 8, the Memphis Police Department published the official Safe Haven law of the state on its Twitter. “FYI, The Tennessee Safe Haven law allows mothers of newborns to surrender unharmed babies to designated facilities within two weeks of birth without fear of being prosecuted,” the department added on its page. Designated facilities under Tennessee law include hospitals, birthing centers and community health clinics. Despite the shocking nature of the discovery, some neighbors are urging the community to not make harsh judgments against the newborn’s mother. “You know, everybody’s so quick to judge and condemn people.

12/10/2021,"By James Oliphant and Nathan Layne GRIFFIN, Georgia (Reuters) - Protesters filled the meeting room of the Spalding County Board of Elections in October, upset that the board had disallowed early voting on Sundays for the Nov. 2 municipal election. A year ago, Sunday voting had been instrumental in boosting turnout of Black voters. But this was an entirely different five-member board than had overseen the last election. The Democratic majority of three Black women was gone. So was the Black elections supervisor. Now a faction of three white Republicans controlled the board – thanks to a bill passed by the Republican-led Georgia legislature earlier this year. The Spalding board’s new chairman has endorsed former president Donald Trump’s false stolen-election claims on social media. The panel in Spalding, a rural patch south of Atlanta, is one of six county boards that Republicans have quietly reorganized in recent months through similar county-specific state legislation. The changes expanded the party’s power over choosing members of local election boards ahead of the crucial midterm Congressional elections in November 2022. The unusual rash of restructurings follows the state's passage of Senate Bill 202, which restricted ballot access statewide and allowed the Republican-controlled State Election Board to assume control of county boards it deems underperforming. The board immediately launched a performance review of the Democratic-leaning Fulton County board, which oversees part of Atlanta. The Georgia restructurings are part of a national Republican effort to expand control over election administration in the wake of Trump’s false voter-fraud claims. Republican-led states such as Florida, Texas and Arizona have enacted new curbs on voter access this year. Backers of Trump’s false stolen-election claims are running campaigns for secretary of state - the top election official - in battleground states. And some Republicans in Wisconsin are seeking to eliminate the state’s bipartisan election commission and threatening its members with prosecution. The stakes are high in Georgia, which last year backed a Democrat for president for the first time since 1992. Its first-term Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock will be up for reelection in 2022, a contest that could prove pivotal to which party controls Congress. The governor’s race next year pits incumbent Republican Brian Kemp against Trump-endorsed candidate David Perdue in a primary. The winner will likely face Democrat Stacey Abrams, a voting rights advocate. Both Warnock and Abrams are Black. The county board restructurings and statewide voting restrictions, Democrats and voting-rights groups say, represent the most sweeping changes in decades to Georgia’s electoral system. Until 2013, Georgia elections operated under federal oversight to ensure fair participation for Black voters in this once-segregated Southern state. Democrats say Republicans are trying to expand their control over election administration functions that should be nonpartisan. That could result in suppression of votes, they said, and could give Republicans control over certification of results, along with recounts and audits of contested elections. “We are talking about a normalization of Republican takeovers of local functions,” says Saira Draper, director of voter protection for the Georgia Democratic Party. Republicans say the changes aim to restore public trust in elections after many problems during the 2020 elections. ""What we want to make sure is that we have election integrity,” said Butch Miller, the No. 2 Republican in the Georgia Senate, a leading advocate for Senate Bill 202 and a sponsor of the bill to reconstitute the Lincoln County election board. In five of the Georgia counties that restructured election boards - Troup, Morgan, Pickens, Stephens and Lincoln - the legislature shifted the power to appoint some or all election board members to local county commissions, all of which are currently controlled by Republicans. Previously, the appointments had been split evenly between the local Democratic and Republican parties, sometimes with other local entities controlling some appointments. The intent of the old system: To ensure a politically balanced or nonpartisan board. In the sixth county, Spalding, the parties still choose two members each, but the fifth member is now chosen by local judges. (It used to be decided by a coin flip.) Those judges tend to be politically conservative; they appointed a white Republican to replace a Black Democrat on the election board, giving Republicans a 3-2 majority. In Morgan County, the majority-Republican county commission reconstituted its election board, ousting two outspoken Black Democrats. In Troup County, a Black Democratic member claims the board shake-up was aimed at ousting her after she fought to increase voting access. Reuters could not determine the exact split of Democrats and Republicans in the five counties that handed control to county commissions before and after their restructurings. That’s because board members’ party affiliation is not public information in Georgia, and board representatives declined to identify their allegiances. RESTRICTING ACCESS The county election boards have broad authority over voter access, such as polling locations and early-voting procedures. They also have considerable sway over post-election provisional-ballot tallies, audits and recounts. Reconstituted boards in two of the six counties have already moved to restrict voting access. In addition to Spalding’s termination of Sunday voting, Lincoln County has proposed consolidating its seven precincts into one voting center, which critics say would discourage voting by people traveling from remote areas. Proponents say it would make voting more efficient and secure. The proposal is set for a vote on Thursday. In Lincoln County, the new law removes appointments by political parties and gives the Republican-led county commission discretion to appoint the board's three-member majority. County Republicans say the changes are meant to comply with a 2018 state Supreme Court ruling, which dictated that private entities cannot appoint members to government bodies. That decision, however, involved boards of ethics, not elections, and many other Georgia counties continue to allow political-party appointments to election boards. The changes come in the wake of Trump’s false claims of election fraud. Trump won Spalding County with 60% of the 2020 vote. But his margin of victory declined by 4 percentage points from 2016 as turnout among Black voters jumped 20% in a county where the population is 35% black. Trump supporters rifled through the dumpsters behind Spalding’s election office, looking for tossed ballots. None were found. Others demanded to watch the vote-counting. Sheriff’s deputies had to escort election workers to their cars. In Georgia and nationwide, some Trump supporters have threatened election officials with violence. With conservative judges now choosing the county election board’s fifth member, the previous fifth member, Vera McIntosh, a Black Democrat, has been ousted. She was replaced by James Newland, who is also vice-chair of the county Republican Party. In September, he voted to end Sunday voting. The board’s new chair is Ben Johnson, a former official of the county Republican party. Johnson declined to comment on his social media posts endorsing Trump’s false voter-fraud claims. He would not answer questions about whether he acknowledged that Biden won the 2020 election fairly. McIntosh, the ousted Democrat, called the changes a “power grab” by local Republicans who wanted to “go back and prove the ‘Big Lie’ was real,” referring to Trump’s election-fraud claims. “They wanted control,” she said. “They got control.” The law restructuring Spalding’s board also required the elections supervisor to live in the county, a change that forced out the incumbent supervisor, Marcia Ridley. Two other Black Democrats on the board quit: Margaret Bentley and Glenda Henley, who cited objections to the law and harassment from Trump supporters. Henley said the board’s meetings were increasingly attended by Trump supporters crying fraud. She called the tensions “exhausting” and said: “I have never been afraid in this town, but I am now.” The restructured board still includes two Democrats, one of whom is Black. Republican state representative David Knight from Spalding, who co-sponsored a bill to reconstitute the board, said the changes had nothing to do with race or partisanship. They aimed, he said, ""to restore the integrity of our election board and voter confidence."" On Election Day in 2020, voting machines malfunctioned in all 18 precincts, resulting in long waits. Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger called for Ridley’s resignation, and the Republican-controlled State Election Board referred her handling of the problems to the state attorney general, who has to date not taken any action. Ridley denies any mismanagement, saying her staff “worked hard to ensure that no voter got disenfranchised and all were able to vote.” FREE AND FAIR? In western Georgia’s Troup County, the Republican-controlled county commission now appoints all election board members, a power previously shared by three cities and the two political parties. Lonnie Hollis, one of two Black female members, will leave the board at year-end. Hollis, who has served since 2013, said the restructuring was aimed at unseating her because she fought to increase voter access. Her efforts included advocating for the first voting location in a predominantly Black church in the county, which she said has multiple precincts in predominantly white churches. Patrick Crews, the Republican chairman of Troup County commissioners, denied Hollis was targeted for removal. “Our goal is to be inclusive and appoint members who are concerned about having fair and honest elections,” Crews said. In Morgan County, two Black Democrats on the board, Helen Butler and Avery Jackson, were removed after the new law eliminated political-party appointments and handed appointment power to the Republican-dominated commission. Butler and Jackson sought reappointments but were denied. The commission chair, Philipp von Hanstein, did not respond to a comment request. Butler has long advocated for voting rights and social justice. Testifying before a special U.S. Senate subcommittee in July, she said she was ousted for fighting the closure of polling locations and advocating for ballot drop boxes. Butler warned that the restructurings could “enable members of the majority party to overturn election results they do not like.""
