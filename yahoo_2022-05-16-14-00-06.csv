5/16/2022,"The White House slammed Bezos for opposing its economic priorities. A White House spokesperson said ""it doesn't require a huge leap"" to understand why Bezos resisted tax hikes. Bezos lambasted the White House for pushing a plan he claimed would worsen inflation. The White House fired back at the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos on Sunday evening for opposing an economic spending package that included taxes on the wealthiest Americans. ""It doesn't require a huge leap to figure out why one of the wealthiest individuals on Earth opposes an economic agenda for the middle class that cuts some of the biggest costs families face, fights inflation for the long haul, and adds to the historic deficit reduction the President is achieving by asking the richest taxpayers and corporations to pay their fair share,"" White House spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement to The Washington Post's Jeff Stein. Bates went on: ""It's also unsurprising that this tweet comes after the President met with labor organizers, including Amazon employees."" Earlier that day Bezos had criticized President Joe Biden's administration for trying to pass a social and climate spending package once known as Build Back Better. He argued it amounted to ""more stimulus into an already over-heated, inflationary economy and only Manchin saved them from themselves."" That was a reference to Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a conservative Democrat who tanked the spending plan in late December. Democrats have been unable to revive a smaller version of the package so far, and Manchin has swerved on whether he's interested to back a bill. Democrats can't approve the plan over unified GOP resistance without his support in the 50-50 Senate. Biden's Build Back Better plan is different from the $1.9 trillion stimulus package that he signed into law in March 2021. The stimulus was meant as a one-time relief effort to flood the economy with direct payments and unemployment benefits for individuals, aid to state and local governments, and money for public-health systems. The federal government didn't raise revenue to finance that spending, so it was added to the national debt. Some experts say it worsened inflation since it overpowered demand. Supply-chain bottlenecks and other pandemic-related disruptions have been a persistent factor in rising prices for groceries and gas. The Build Back Better plan was intended to be fully paid for with tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans. While that bill has been on the back burner, Biden has been focused on repackaging his agenda to combat inflation as well as touting his labor credentials. He hosted union organizers from Amazon and Starbucks earlier this month.

5/16/2022,"KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine has deployed many of its new U.S. M-777 howitzers at the front lines and Washington has delivered all but one of the 90 artillery pieces they were due to send, the U.S. embassy in Kyiv said on Sunday. The M-777 howitzer consignment is part of a huge outlay of weapons from Washington to help Ukraine fend off Russia's invasion, which began on Feb. 24. The M-777 is seen as particularly significant because of its long range and accuracy. The U.S. embassy reposted a Ukrainian military video of Kyiv's soldiers training to use the weapons. ""M-777 Howitzers in action. Part of the United States' most recent $800 million care package for the Ukrainian Armed Forces,"" it tweeted. ""All but one of the 90 Howitzers sent by the United States are now in Ukraine, many now deployed on the front lines,"" it said.

5/16/2022,"PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — A Rhode Island dog whose inspiring story of going from shelter dog to lifesaving police K-9 became the subject of a recent Netflix movie has been euthanized. State Police said Sunday K-9 Ruby was put down Friday following a “sudden, acute, and untreatable illness.” She was 11 years old. Col. Darnell Weaver, superintendent of the state police, expressed gratitude for K-9 Ruby's years of service. “K-9 Ruby dedicated her life to serve the citizens of Rhode Island and make a positive impact on every person she ever interacted with,"" he said in a statement. “She became a symbol of hope for all shelter dogs, showing the world what a shelter dog can do when just given love and the chance to shine.” Ruby served with the Rhode Island State Police for 11 years and was handled by Corporal Daniel O’Neil, Weaver said. Part Australian shepherd and part border collie, Ruby was one of the first shelter dogs trained to serve with the Rhode Island State Police. She participated in numerous search-and-rescue missions and made many public appearances during her career. Ruby gained notoriety in 2017 when she located a teenage boy who was severely injured while hiking in the woods. The boy turned out to be the son of the animal shelter volunteer who had fought to keep her from being put down. “She was a total knucklehead,” shelter volunteer and dog trainer Patricia Inman had told The Associated Press of Ruby, who had been returned by five families for being too rambunctious before O'Neil adopted the then-eight-month-old in 2011. Ruby earned national recognition for the rescue — the American Humane Hero Dog organization named her the nation’s “Search and Rescue Dog of the Year” — and her story was made into the 2022 Netflix movie “Rescued by Ruby.” “She had a full, happy, and wonderful life, not only as a trooper, but as part of a loving family,” Weaver said. “She worked right until the end and never gave up doing what she loved most — making people smile.” Ruby lived with O’Neil and his family and will be honored privately, police said. “She was given a chance and she’s been doing everything she can to pay it back,” O’Neil said earlier this year. “You have this dog that was given up on, and she’s changed so many people’s lives.” Despite her lauded search-and-rescue career, Ruby's mischievous spirit was irrepressible: Three years ago, she bolted near a state park, turning up safe and sound  after a 19-hour search. More recently, she returned from a bathroom break with a live skunk writhing — and spraying — in her jaws. The antics were part of what made Ruby, well, Ruby. Above all, she was a good dog. “If you show them love and compassion and you give them a certain type of stability, they’ll show their true colors,” O'Neil had said.",U.S./Associated Press,K-9 featured in Netflix's 'Rescued by Ruby' euthanized,https://news.yahoo.com/k-9-featured-netflixs-rescued-164045699.html
