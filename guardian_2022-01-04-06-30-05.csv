1/4/2022,"Ralf Rangnick hit out at Manchester United for their individual and collective failure during Monday’s 1-0 loss to Wolves, with the interim manager admitting he cannot guarantee a top-four finish, while Luke Shaw questioned the unity of senior players. United’s first defeat in the German’s sixth match in charge meant the visitors broke a 42-year sequence without a league win at United due to Joao Moutinho’s 82nd-minute winner. While it lifted Bruno Lage’s side to eighth, United are only a place higher, four points behind Arsenal in the final Champions League spot.  Rangnick said: “We didn’t play well at all individually or collectively. Today we showed similar problems the team had three or four weeks ago before I arrived. It is not an easy job to develop a DNA with and without the ball.” The 63-year-old was asked if United can finish in the top four. “I cannot make any guarantees,” he said. “Look at today’s performance: if I say we are 100% convinced we will finish in the top four I don’t know if people will believe that. It is about taking the next steps and getting better. I knew this could be hard. “I knew it would be difficult - that’s the reason why they brought me. I knew it wouldn’t be easy to find a balance between offensively and defensively. We didn’t press at all. We tried but we were not able to get into those pressing situations.” Shaw was scathing, questioning the togetherness of a core of senior players in the XI that included him, Cristiano Ronaldo, Edinson Cavani, Raphael Varane, Bruno Fernanes, and Nemanja Matic. “Us players [who] we have been here a long time, maybe tonight we struggled,” said the defender. “I didn’t think we were all there together. You look at the players we have, we have unbelievable quality but sometimes quality is not enough. “They were miles better in the first half. We let them take control of the game, we weren’t aggressive, we needed to bring more intensity. Maybe we lacked that today. We need to bring the intensity and more motivation. “Inside the dressing room, we know what we want but out on the pitch we need to give 100%. To win these types of games we all need to be 100% committed. It is tough and disappointing.” Rangnick was noticeably booed when he removed Mason Greenwood in the second half. “The question was shall I take off Mason or shall I take off Edi [Cavani],” he said. “We decided to keep Edi as the more offensive. “It shows how high the fans like Mason as a homegrown player. His effort and performance was not outstanding but he was one of the better players today.” Moutinho, who celebrated his goal in the style of Bebeto, said: “I have a baby that is three months old and the goal is for my wife and two daughters. I had to wait nine months and three months more to be able to do this celebration.”",Sport/Football,"Manchester United failed ‘individually and collectively’, says Ralf Rangnick",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/03/manchester-united-failed-individually-and-collectively-says-ralf-rangnick
1/4/2022," The headline of an opinion piece should have referred to “Ubuntu”, an African ethical philosophy, rather than “Bantu” (Can white South Africa live up to Tutu’s Bantu ideals?, 1 January, Journal, p4). In the context of South Africa, the term “Bantu” is considered offensive because of its strong association with the apartheid era, when it was used as a designation for the country’s black population; it is now used only when referring to a specific group of African languages.

1/4/2022,"Even with the Ashes gone, the inquests under way and his future under the spotlight, Joe Root was talking a good game ahead of the Sydney Test. “For us it’s a must-win game,” he said. “I know the series isn’t winnable, but it’s a good opportunity.” On the Australian side, meanwhile, Steve Smith was urging his team to turn the screw by making it 4-0. “We’ve wrapped up the series which is great, and we want to continue winning,” he said. “That’s important.” So far so routine, although in the spirit of transparency it seems fair to point out that the above quotes were taken not from the current series, but from the corresponding mismatch in January 2018, four years ago to the day. Well, they do say one of the best things about Test cricket is its timelessness.  And so once again the Ashes circus arrives in Sydney smelling faintly of rust, ennui and elephant shit, as players and broadcasters desperately try to inject a little jeopardy into this long-moribund series. Nathan Lyon insists there is no such thing as a “dead rubber when you’re wearing the baggy green”. There are World Test Championship points at stake, after all, and places for the forthcoming tour of New Zealand to be contested. As for England, the quadrennial fit of introspection and ritual bloodletting, the comforting fixation on County Championship schedules and ball manufacturers, has perhaps obscured the wider implications of another hopelessly unequal encounter. This is, we are constantly told, a flagship series: a yardstick for the health of the game as a whole. What, then, does it say when India and South Africa are currently serving up a more compelling show than anything seen in Australia over the last month? This is hardly a new phenomenon, either. It is 39 years since a men’s Ashes series in Australia reached its final Test with the fate of the urn in the balance. In England it has happened just twice in my lifetime – in 2005 and 2009. The lack of alarm over this should be alarming in itself. The bare minimum we demand of sport is that it has consequence. Yet by the end of this series, 27 of the last 88 Ashes Tests will essentially have been cold product, nothing riding on them but pride and broadcasting contracts. Is there not a better way of doing this? Part of the issue is that Test cricket itself has changed. Five-match series made sense in previous eras because of the frequency of draws and washouts. No such need exists these days. The last 23 Ashes Tests have produced two draws. That drops to one from the last 32 in Australia, home of some of the most favourable batting conditions in world cricket. Increasingly a five-match series – particularly where one team is demonstrably worse than the other – feel like an elaborate form of torture, a way of forcing imploding teams to keep imploding until there is nothing left. Even a theoretically-close series gains little from being drawn out over its full length. Both the 2015 and 2019 series felt pale and drained by their conclusion, and not in a good way: flawed sides taking wild swings at each other, exhausted players desperately trying to cling to the precipice. The virtue of a long series used to be in their ebb and flow, the possibility of redemption and learning. But with schedules trimmed to the skeleton and warm-up games hunted to extinction, that hardly happens any more. The simplest solution would be to cut the Ashes down to three or four Tests, perhaps with an optional decider in the case of a tie. But there is a more radical alternative out there, taking its inspiration from the women’s Ashes, which has flourished since switching to a multi-format competition in 2013. Three Tests, three one-day internationals, three Twenty20s: the overall winner being either the first to a certain number of points, or to win two series. Fewer days of cricket overall, but a more varied and textured challenge, and arguably a truer test of systems and cultures, which at its heart is what the Ashes was originally supposed to be about. Teams would be forced to strike a balance between red and white-ball structures, between specialists and all-format players. Bigger squads and more rest days would give the series a chance to breathe in a packed calendar. At least once a decade we would probably be treated to the sight of the Ashes being decided in the final over. And really, we need to decide what we want this cherished and venerable competition to be in the modern age. A museum piece, a fading heritage tour, a sort of fancy dress historical re-enactment that bears less and less resemblance to the cutting edge of the sport with every passing iteration? At the very least, it’s time to consider whether five compressed five-day Tests every couple of years really is the best way to settle and sell this oldest of rivalries. (You could, if you were feeling particularly daring, even combine men’s and women’s Ashes under a single banner.) Or, alternatively, we can keep rocking up in Sydney every four years with empty platitudes and crossed fingers, hoping that things will be different this time. And maybe they will. Doing nothing is certainly an option. But as the game fractures and old certainties erode, it’s increasingly hard to argue it’s the best one.",Sport/Sport,Radical change is needed to stop the Ashes ending up a fading museum piece,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/03/cricket-ashes-radical-change-needed-england-australia
1/4/2022,"A large cleanup effort is under way in Los Angeles county after an estimated 8.5m gallons of raw sewage flooded through a neighborhood in the city of Carson, closing beaches and leaving toilet paper, feces and toxic residue strewn across nearby streets and sidewalks. The spill occurred last Thursday when a 60-year-old sewer line failed, spewing sewage from a manhole and into the Dominguez Channel, a 15-mile flood-control waterway that eventually pours into the Pacific Ocean.  The failed 48-inch sewer main was due to be replaced within the year and was probably strained after strong rainstorms pelted southern California. LA County Supervisor Janice Hahn has called for a full investigation into the cause of the spill, the largest on record for the area. “A sewage spill of this magnitude is dangerous and unacceptable, and we need to understand what happened,” Hahn said in a statement. “The recent storm undoubtedly contributed to the spill but we need infrastructure that doesn’t fail when it rains.” City officials said Monday that beaches in nearby Long Beach will remain closed as water quality testing continues. Several beaches in Los Angeles and Orange counties were closed over the weekend after the spill and surfing, swimming and holiday events like the annual Polar Bear Swim – where locals have enjoyed a frigid New Year’s dip at Cabrillo beach for the past 70 years – had to be canceled. Hahn, who called the event a “treasured local tradition”, added that “canceling it is a terrible way to start off the year”. The spill occurred just months after another environmental disaster affected the residents of Carson, a city that sits just north of Long Beach and south of downtown Los Angeles. The Dominguez Channel was recently plagued by an overpowering odor, described by residents as “the stench of death”, that caused headaches, respiratory problems and other health problems. Officials have attributed the odor to a warehouse fire that leeched chemicals into the 15-mile canal, killing plants and unleashing high amounts of hydrogen sulfide, also known as sewer gas. The sewage flow has been stopped according to the Los Angeles County Sanitation District, and abnormal hydrogen sulfide levels were not detected in the area. The agency said that the affected streets and storm drains had been cleaned, and it will reimburse residents for car washes. Meanwhile, crews are still working to repair the pipe. As of Sunday, LA County Sanitation Districts said plans were in place to “slip-line” the pipe, a process where a smaller 42-inch corrosion-resistant pipe is placed inside the 48-inch sewer, but that the materials wouldn’t be delivered until later in the week. The process has been complicated by the line’s position near a freeway, which has also caused offramp closures. This wasn’t the first time sewage spilled on to these streets of Carson. Resident Cesar Casillas told Fox11 Los Angeles it was the second spill that he and his neighbors have dealt with in five years. “It’s something you don’t want to see ever,” Casillas said, describing the noxious smell that lingered days into the cleanup effort. “There is still toilet paper smudged into the soil,” he added. “My children can’t play out here – I don’t think it’s safe.”",News/Business,Broken sewer line spills millions of gallons of waste into streets of California city,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/03/broken-sewer-line-spills-waste-into-california-city
