1/27/2022,"“Late Night” host Seth Meyers on Wednesday mocked faux conservative indignation over President Joe Biden’s hot mic moment with Fox News’ Peter Doocy. Meyers drew attention to former Donald Trump White House physician Ronny Jackson’s disingenuous claim on Fox News that Biden’s “stupid son of a bitch” snipe at Doocy showed he was short-tempered, irritable and lashing out — all signals of cognitive decline, he said. Jackson is now a Republican House lawmaker representing Texas. “I just wish there was an example of someone prominent with those symptoms who we could compare him to,” said Meyers, as footage of Trump showing those exact personality traits ran in the background.

1/27/2022,"Albuquerque police have made a second arrest in a year-old murder that involved a group of armed robbers who used Snapchat to lure at least two victims. Anna Dukes, 18, was arrested by Albuquerque police on Monday for the murder of Elias Otero, 24, on Feb. 11, 2021 as well as the armed robbery and kidnapping of the deceased man's brother Nicholas Otero, 20, the Albuquerque police announced. A warrant for Dukes' arrest and that of the alleged shooter, her boyfriend Adrian Avila, 17, was issued by police just before Christmas, according to the Albuquerque Journal. Avila turned himself in on Dec. 27, police said. Dukes is being held on one charge of murder in the first degree (willful & deliberate), one charge of first-degree kidnapping, two charges of armed robbery, one charge conspiracy to commit a felony and one charge of tampering with evidence, according to prison records. She is currently held without bail. According to an arrest warrant reviewed by the Journal, a woman called 911 to the Otero home shortly before 2:20 a.m. on Feb. 11 last year, saying her brother had been shot. When they arrived, they found Elias Otero, shot, lying in the street outside the home. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Near his body, they found three pistols and a rifle. Relatives told them that three armed men had arrived with Nicolas Otero in his red Lexus and another car, demanding money. One of them shot Elias Otero, a former corrections officer, when he exited the home with his own gun. Nicholas Otero's car was found, wrecked and abandoned, a couple blocks from the scene. Nicolas Otero, who had escaped during the shooting, told police that he'd picked up a girl he'd met on Snapchat in his Lexus some time after midnight, and the two drove to Alvarado Park. He ""became uneasy,"" according to police, after the girl began complimenting his ""diamond-encrusted necklace,"" the Journal reported at the time of Avila's arrest, and asked him if he had any guns and where he kept his money. When they stopped at the park, he noticed that her phone showed she was on a call — and that, presumably, somebody else had been listening to the entire conversation — just before three armed suspects pulled up in another vehicle right behind his. The three forced Nicolas Otero to exit his car at gunpoint, and one held a gun on him — begging the others to let him shoot the victim, Otero said — while the other two searched his car. ""They stripped him down. They took his credit cards and took whatever he had on him, but they wanted more money,"" the victim's mother, Alicia Otero, told Albuquerque CBS affiliate KKTV. The robbers then forced Nicolas Otero back in his car and drove both his car and the other vehicle to the home he shared with his family. There, police say, the robbers forced Nicolas to call his brother Elias and demand that he bring the armed robbers $1,000 and a gun. Elias Otero did exit the residence with a gun — one with which he threatened to shoot the man driving his brother's car and holding Nicolas at gunpoint. That man, police say, was Dukes' boyfriend Avila, who allegedly proceeded to shoot Elias Otero. Alicia Otero, told Albuquerque ABC affiliate KOAT that her son was shot five times. Police were able to identify the woman who lured Nicolas Ortero to Alvarado Park as Dukes via her Snapchat account, which then linked her phone to the park, Otero's house and Avila's residence, according to the Journal. Her Snapchat account revealed that she had been chatting with another man the night before the Oteros' kidnapping and murder; police said that man had been carjacked the night before while on their ""date."" It was his car the robbers used on the night they targeted Nicolas Otero; it was also found abandoned the morning after the shooting. Police have yet to identify or issue warrants for the other two people involved in the carjackings and robberies. After Avila's arrest, Alicia Otero told Albuquerque NBC affiliate KOB that the family was pleased with the progress on the case. ""My husband and I were in tears and we found out,"" she told the station. ""We're just all so happy about it."" ""I made a promise to my son that I was going to fight for him,"" she told KOB after Avila's first court appearance. ""I am not going to let them get away and I plan to keep my promise."" After Dukes' arrest, she told the station: ""Knowing they finally turned themselves in just, it feels good that it's not gonna go unsolved.""",U.S./Oxygen,Teen Arrested For Murder Of Ex-Corrections Officer During Kidnapping,https://news.yahoo.com/teen-arrested-murder-ex-corrections-202412719.html

1/27/2022,"WASHINGTON – This time, it won’t be so easy. Russia had no problem getting past Ukraine’s military forces when it orchestrated a bloodless takeover of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. Russian President Vladimir Putin even boasted that not a single shot was fired during the assault. But Russian troops will face a far more formidable adversary if Putin invades Ukraine again now. Ukraine’s military is better trained, better equipped and more battle tested than it was eight years ago, experts say. “They are not what they were in 2014,” said Jim Townsend, a former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense. While Russia is still the superior military power and would almost certainly prevail, Ukraine’s defense forces could inflict significant damage on Russian troops, according to an analysis by the Atlantic Council, a non-partisan think tank based in Washington. “In collaboration with reservists, civil society, and volunteers, they can make any attempted invasion a miserable experience for Russia,” the group concluded in a report last month. TENSIONS IN UKRAINE: US responds to Russia's demands Ukraine has 250,000 active-duty troops, plus another 290,000 reserve personnel and 50,000 paramilitary units that could be activated in a conflict with Russia. In 2014, by comparison, Ukraine had just 140,000 troops, and only 6,000 of those were ready for combat. Russia has more than 1 million active-duty personnel, more than four times Ukraine's force strength. Russia also has 378,000 reserve personnel and 250,000 paramilitary troops that it could call up in a conflict with its neighbor. Russia, hands down. In terms of land power, Russia prevails, with more than 12,000 tanks (compared to 2,500 for Ukraine), 30,000 armored vehicles (Ukraine has 12,000) and 12,000 self-propelled artillery (Ukraine has just a little over 1,000). Russia also dominates in air power, with more than 700 fighter aircraft (compared to around 70 for Ukraine), more than 700 attack aircraft (Ukraine has fewer than 30), more than 500 attack helicopters (Ukraine has 34) and 1,500 helicopters (Ukraine has a little over 100). At sea, Russia rules with 15 destroyers, 70 submarines, 11 frigates and nearly 50 mine warfare vessels. Ukraine has no destroyers or submarines, just one frigate and one mine warfare vessel. PENTAGON PREPARES: 8,500 troops on alert as Biden consults with European allies on Ukraine   USA TODAY  The U.S. has already spent billions of dollars to help Ukraine build up its military defenses, an investment that's likely to escalate dramatically if Russia invades. Though President Joe Biden has said the U.S. would not send troops to help defend Ukraine against Russian forces, he said the U.S. probably would send more American forces to other European countries, including Poland and Romania. The Pentagon announced on Monday it is putting 8,500 U.S. troops on ""heightened alert"" for possible deployment to Eastern Europe amid the crisis. WHAT ARE JOE BIDEN'S OPTIONS IN UKRAINE:It all depends on Putin's next move And last week, the White House said it will give an additional $200 million in defensive military equipment to Ukraine. The package reportedly includes anti-armor missiles, ammunition and other items. The U.S. is sending weapons to Ukraine through third-party transfers, in which NATO members provide U.S.-made weapons. The transfers include javelin anti-tank weapons from Estonia, stinger air defense systems from Lithuania and Latvia and anti-tank missiles from the United Kingdom. PUTIN 'WON'T STOP' WITH UKRAINE:Why Americans should care about Russia's aggression against its neighbor Ukraine was completely unprepared for war when Russia invaded Crimea in 2014. Its armed forces were not manned, equipped or trained to meet Russian aggression, and its logistic stockpiles were essentially non-existent, with the exception of weapons and ammunition mostly from the Soviet period, according to the Atlantic Council. Ukraine has made modernizing its military a priority over the past seven years but decades of neglect have been difficult to overcome, the council reported. Ukraine's military still has several strategic vulnerabilities, including gaps in key operational and combat capabilities. Corruption remains a problem, funding is limited because of the general economic conditions in the country, and many important weapons purchases have been placed on the back burner – not because of a lack of will but because a lack of funding, the council’s analysis concluded. WHAT IS HAPPENING AT UKRAINE'S BORDER?: Putin's buildup of Russian troops sparks concern It’s hard to say. Russia would probably attack Ukraine from different directions, forcing Ukraine to split up its forces to confront the advancing troops, Townsend said. “They're going to have to defend Ukraine from a number of different avenues of approach,” he said, “so it just makes their inferiority even worse because they’re going to be thin.” On top of that, Russia would likely engage in cyberattacks against Ukraine’s military and civilian society, which from the outset could degrade the country’s electrical grid and telecommunications systems, Townsend said. “I don't think you're going to see the Ukraine being able to stop the Russians for a long period of time,” he said.

1/27/2022,"MANILA (Reuters) - Former boxing superstar Manny Pacquiao, who has vowed to root out graft in the Philippine government if elected president, said on Thursday he would proudly disclose full details of his wealth and challenged all officials to do the same. ""I worked hard for my wealth. I invested blood, sweat and risked by life to earn that,"" Pacquiao told DZBB radio. ""All public servants should disclose (their asset declaration)."" Pacquiao's remarks came after another presidential contender, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., previously said he would be careful in releasing his statement of assets for it might be used by political opponents. President Rodrigo Duterte, whose government Pacquiao criticised for not doing enough to battle graft, has not shared his asset declaration his wealth to the public since 2017. Pacquiao, who is a senator, has made fighting corruption a centrepiece of his presidential campaign, likening corrupt officials to ""cancer"" in government. He has promised to put them to jail. ""I have plenty of ways and strategies to fight corruption but I could not reveal them yet lest these officials might prepare. God gave me the knowledge and the wisdom how to eradicate corruption,"" said the former eight-division champion. While no one questions his prowess inside the ring, some political observers doubt his ability to govern and guide the economy back to recovery after it has been ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic. ""I would not have ran (for president) if didn't think I have the capability. Why would I embarrass myself?"" Pacquiao said. ""I know all the country's problems and I know the solutions.""
