5/13/2022,"BRUSSELS (AP) — It’s likely to be the quickest NATO enlargement ever and one that would redraw Europe’s security map. Finnish leaders announced Thursday their belief that Finland should join the world’s biggest military organization because of Russia's war in Ukraine. Sweden could soon follow suit. Should they apply for membership, the move would have far-reaching ramifications for Northern Europe and trans-Atlantic security. No doubt, it will also anger their large neighbor Russia, which blames, at least in part, its war in Ukraine on NATO’s continued expansion closer to its borders. It's unclear how Russian President Vladimir Putin might retaliate. The Kremlin said Thursday that it certainly won't improve European security. The following is a brief look at what Finland and Sweden's membership in the 30-country NATO alliance could mean, with the Nordic partners expected to announce their intention to join within days. FINLAND AND SWEDEN Not neutral like Switzerland, Finland and Sweden traditionally think of themselves as militarily “nonaligned.” But Russia’s war in Ukraine and Putin’s apparent desire to establish a Moscow-centered “sphere of influence” has shaken their security notions to the core. Just days after he ordered the Feb. 24 invasion, public opinion shifted dramatically. Support in Finland for NATO membership has hovered around 20-30% for years. It now stands at over 70%. The two are NATO’s closest partners but maintaining good ties with Russia has been an important part of their foreign policy, particularly for Finland. Now they hope for security support from NATO states — primarily the United States — in case Moscow retaliates. Britain pledged on Wednesday to come to their aid. THE NORDIC REGION NATO membership for the two, joining regional neighbors Denmark, Norway and Iceland, would formalize their joint security and defense work in ways that their Nordic Defense Cooperation pact hasn't. NORDEFCO, as it’s known, focuses on cooperation. Working within NATO means putting forces under joint command. Accession would tighten the strategic Nordic grip on the Baltic Sea — Russia’s maritime point of access to the city of St. Petersburg and its Kaliningrad exclave. Finland and Sweden also join them, along with Iceland, at the heart of the triangle formed with the North Atlantic and maritime areas in the Arctic, to where Russia projects its military might from the northern Kola Peninsula. Integrated NATO military planning will become a lot simpler, making the region easier to defend. NATO Finland and Sweden are NATO’s closest partners. They contribute to the alliance’s operations and air policing. Most importantly, they already meet NATO’s membership criteria, on functioning democracies, good neighborly relations, clear borders and armed forces that are in lock-step with the allies. After the invasion, they formally boosted information exchanges with NATO and sit in on every meeting on war issues. Both are modernizing their armed forces and investing in new equipment. Finland is purchasing dozens of high-end F-35 warplanes. Sweden has top quality fighter jets, the Gripen. Finland says it’s already hit NATO’s defense spending guideline of 2% of gross domestic product. Sweden too is ramping up its military budget and expects to reach the target by 2028. The NATO average was estimated at 1.6% last year. RUSSIA Putin has demanded that NATO stop expanding and in his May 9 speech blamed the West for the war. But public opinion in Finland and Sweden suggests that he has driven them into NATO’s arms. If Finland joins, it would double the length of the alliance’s border with Russia, adding a further 1,300 kilometers (830 miles) for Moscow to defend. Putin has promised a “military, technical” response if they join. But many troops from Russia’s western district near Finland were sent to Ukraine, and those units suffered heavy casualties, Western military officers say. So far, Moscow is doing nothing obvious to dissuade the two — apart perhaps from a couple of incidents where Russian planes entered their airspace. The Kremlin said Thursday that its response could depend on how close NATO infrastructure moves toward Russia's borders. Some at NATO worry that the Russians might deploy nuclear weapons or more hypersonic missiles to the Kaliningrad exclave, across the Baltic Sea wedged between allies Poland and Lithuania. ___ Karl Ritter in Stockholm, and Jari Tanner in Helsinki, contributed to this report.",World/Associated Press,"EXPLAINER: Why Finland, Sweden joining NATO will be big deal",https://news.yahoo.com/explainer-why-finland-sweden-joining-102127032.html
5/13/2022,"Thomas Jefferson once wrote to Congress that the US would try to drive Native Americans into debt to take their land. He suggested encouraging Indian Tribes to purchase goods on credit so they would go into debt. The president's comments were references in a report on US Indian Schools, which abused and forcibly assimilated children. Thomas Jefferson once secretly wrote to Congress that the US would try to drive Native Americans into debt in order to take their land. The US president's note to lawmakers was referenced in a report from the Interior Department published Wednesday. ""In 1803, President Thomas Jefferson delivered a Confidential Message to Congress on Indian Policy explaining a strategy to dispossess Indian Tribes of their territories in part by assimilation,"" the report said. According to the report, Jefferson believed ""a policy of assimilation would make it easier and less costly in lives and funding for the United States to separate Indian Tribes from their territories."" During the Gold Rush in the late 1840s and early 1850s, well-armed settlers were prepared to kill and carry out a genocide against Native Americans in California. These violent attacks against Native Americans were often supported and funded by the state's newly created government. The legislation was also used to strip Native Americans of legal rights and protections, such as through the ironically named Act for the Government and Protection of Indians in 1850. Executed alongside the assimilation policy would be a process to encourage Native Americans to make purchases with credit. The hope, according to the report, was that they would fall into debt, meaning Indian tribes would have to ""cede their land"" to the US. ""To promote this disposition to exchange lands which they have to spare & we want, for necessaries, which we have to spare & they want, we shall push our trading houses, and be glad to see the good & influential individuals among them run in debt, because we observe that when these debts get beyond what the individuals can pay, they become willing to lop th[em off] by a cession of lands,"" Jefferson wrote in his letter to Congress. The other method Jefferson invoked to rid Native Americans of their land was to convince them to abandon their supposed hunting lifestyles and instead raise more livestock — a way of life that requires far less land. ""The extensive forests necessary in the hunting life, will then become useless, and they will see advantage in exchanging them for the means of improving their farms, and of increasing their domestic comforts,"" Jefferson wrote. ""I trust and believe we are acting for their greatest good,"" Jefferson wrote in reference to his proposals to Congress. It was these suggestions that went on to create Federal Indian law and policy, the report said. The larger report released Wednesday probed Indian Schools in the US, where Indigenous children were taken from their families and tribes and forcibly assimilated. The investigation uncovered that over 500 students died while they attended one of the 408 boarding schools for Native American, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian kids that were run or supported by the US government in the 19th and 20th centuries, Insider previously reported. The report also found abuse against the children was common at the schools, including beatings and solitary confinement.

5/13/2022,"The U.S. intelligence community has assessed that Russian President Vladimir Putin is prepared to dig his heels in over the war in Ukraine and let it drag on for some time—and along the way, Putin might resort to extreme measures to ensure Russia wins in the end, top U.S. spies warned Tuesday. The next steps Putin might take include escalating domestic measures that could contribute to the war effort, such as instituting martial law, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Avril Haines warned in a Tuesday briefing. “The uncertain nature of the battle... combined with the reality that Putin faces a mismatch between his ambitions and Russia's current conventional military capabilities likely means the next few months could [be] more unpredictable and potentially escalatory,” DNI Haines told senators. “The current trend increases the likelihood that President Putin will turn to more drastic means, including imposing martial law, reorienting industrial production, or potentially escalatory military actions to free up the resources needed to achieve his objectives as the conflict drags on.” The assessment, which Haines delivered to lawmakers on Capitol Hill Tuesday, comes as Russia’s war in Ukraine enters its 76th day. Russian forces have turned their attention to taking Eastern Ukraine in recent weeks after failing to take the capital, Kyiv, in the early days of the war due to a series of logistical and planning issues. And as the Russian military has shifted its attention to the Donbas, or eastern portions of Ukraine, the fighting is beginning to reach somewhat of a “stalemate,” the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) Director, Scott Berrier, said Tuesday. ‘They Can Fuck Off With This War’: Putin’s Troops Finally Realize They’ve Been Hung Out to Dry “I would characterize it as the Russians aren't winning, and the Ukrainians aren't winning, and we’re at a bit of a stalemate here,” Berrier said. Putin doesn’t view the Donbas as the final stand in Ukraine, though, Haines warned, suggesting that more carnage might be on the way. Putin views it as just a “temporary” focus so that the Russian military can “regain the initiative,” Haines said. “We are not confident that the fight in the Donbas will effectively end the war,” Haines said. “We assess President Putin is preparing for prolonged conflict in Ukraine during which he still intends to achieve goals beyond the Donbas.” The assessment that Putin might escalate comes a day after Victory Day in Russia, when Russians celebrate the victory in World War II—a day U.S. and Ukrainian officials alike had warned Putin would seize on to mobilize more troops for the war. Victory Day came and went without any public mobilization, however. But Russians are starting to see signs that Putin might be secretly putting in the legwork to pull in more resources to make the war effort function beyond the near term, just as Haines is warning Putin has his sights set on doubling down. Moscow Metro employees have been threatened in recent days that they might be sent to the war in a possible mobilization “if there are not enough soldiers to be sent to the ‘special operation,’” one of the employees’ wives told the Coalition for Conscientious Objection to Military Service in Russia and Verstka.media, using the term Russia has been using to describe the war in Ukraine. “At a meeting in the metro depot… all men were ordered to undergo an extraordinary medical examination for subsequent possible sending to the war in Ukraine,” she said, adding that if they disobeyed they were told they could be fired or face criminal accusations. “It was precisely and clearly stated that the leadership is obliged to allocate a certain number of people for possible sending to the war.” The Daily Beast has not independently verified the claims. Russia has already lost tens of thousands of troops in the invasion and for weeks has been looking for alternative sources of manpower. Russia’s been looking to Syria for more fighters, the Wall Street Journal reported, and Russia’s defense minister has said Russia is recruiting 16,000 people from the Middle East to fight in Ukraine, too. Members of Congress have been questioning the U.S. intelligence community for weeks now about whether the Kremlin has tapped into mercenaries working for a private Russian contractor known as the Wagner Group. Haines confirmed Tuesday the Russian government has indeed pulled Wagner in for operations in Ukraine. “We do see Wagner being used in ... Ukraine. We see that,” Haines said. “Russia deployed them effectively in Ukraine.” Putin’s Private Army Accused of Raping New Moms on Maternity Ward The U.S. intelligence community’s assessment that Putin intends the war to last for some time could spell disaster ahead. Putin could become more likely to make a miscalculation and resort to using nuclear weapons, Haines warned. Putin would only “authorize the use of nuclear weapons if he perceived an existential threat to the Russian state,” she said, adding that “with tensions this high there is always an enhanced potential for miscalculation—unintended escalation.” “There is not… an imminent potential for Putin to use nuclear weapons,” Haines clarified.

5/13/2022,"By Neil Jerome Morales MANILA (Reuters) -A tycoon and close associate of outgoing Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte is considering selling businesses collectively worth several billion dollars, including a South China Sea gas field and a commercial land lease firm at the site of a former U.S. military base, two sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday. Dennis Uy, chairman of conglomerate Udenna Corp and listed Chelsea Logistics, has seen rapid growth and diversification of his business empire during the six-year presidency of Duterte, who leaves office next month. The assets he is considering selling are the Malampaya gas field, which Uy had acquired from Chevron and Shell for approximately $1 billion, and Clark Global City, which also cost $1 billion, the sources told Reuters, declining to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to media. They said buyers had been looking at prospects for some of Uy's other businesses, including oil retailer Phoenix Petroleum and his new telecom firm DITO, plus schools and food businesses he operates. It was not immediately clear why Uy, the top campaign contributor of Duterte in his 2016 presidential run, was putting the assets up for sale. His representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Uy, 48, is one of the Philippines' leading entrepreneurs, whose appetite for risk and acquisitions saw him build the bulk of his empire in just a few years. Udenna Corp nearly quadrupled its portfolio to more than 100 firms in the first four years of the Duterte presidency, in sectors from gaming, shipping, education and construction to fast food, ferries, tourism, telecoms and sports cars. The company has long insisted it received no preferential treatment under Duterte and all businesses and contracts were acquired fairly. Duterte will make way for Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the son of the notorious dictator, who won a presidential election by a landslide on Monday. ANNOUNCEMENT 'IMMINENT' Included in the preferred bidders for deals for Malampaya and Clark Gateway - the developer and landlord of a 177-hectare (437.4-acre) business district near Clark international airport - is billionaire Enrique Razon, one of the sources said. The transactions have been in the works for ""some months already"", the source said, adding ""an announcement looks imminent"". Razon, Philippines' third richest man with a net worth of $5.8 billion based on a Forbes ranking, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. His Bloomberry Resorts announced on Wednesday it had signed a deal to invest in Uy's integrated casino-resort projects in Clark and the central province of Cebu. The Malampaya gas field fuels power plants that deliver about a fifth of the Philippines' electricity requirements. In December Uy's Udenna said Malampaya may operate for several more years beyond its projected 2027 project life. The proposed assets sales comes after the pandemic decimated the profitability of many of Uy's businesses. Udenna's total liabilities rose by nearly half to 254 billion pesos ($4.85 billion) in 2020 from 171 billion pesos in 2019, latest available data from the corporate regulator showed.
