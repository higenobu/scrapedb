12/14/2021,"The Bank of England has announced plans to ease mortgage lending rules in a move that could help thousands of first-time buyers get on to the property ladder. The central bank said it wanted to remove a requirement that currently forces borrowers to be able to afford a 3 percentage point rise in interest rates before they can be approved for a home loan.  Scrapping the requirement could help 1% of renters in Britain – about 50,000 people – who are currently not able to meet the affordability test. A further 6% of mortgage borrowers – about 35,000 people – would also have been able to secure a bigger loan if the rule had not been in place. In a development that comes amid a house price boom during the pandemic, the Bank said a rule limiting some new mortgages to 4.5 times a borrowers’ income, as well as separate affordability criteria set by the Financial Conduct Authority, were sufficient to guard against excessive risks in the mortgage market. It will consult on the change in the first half of next year, as part of an overhaul to measures first introduced in 2014 after the 2008 financial crisis to curb excessive risk-taking by high street lenders. Andrew Bailey, the Bank’s governor, said scrapping the affordability requirement should not be regarded as a relaxation of lending standards, as the rule limiting some new mortgages to 4.5 times a borrowers’ income was the main constraint on riskier lending. “We don’t regard it as a relaxation of the rules, rather as an efficiency point, because having now got a body of evidence running back seven years or so now, we were able to take a much more substantial judgment on the effectiveness of the tests,” he said. Speaking as the Bank issued its regular financial stability report, Bailey said the UK financial system was well equipped to deal with a potential fresh economic downturn caused by the emergence of the coronavirus Omicron variant. “At the moment, I don’t think we are in a situation where there is sort of stress around the corner in terms of markets,” he said, pointing out that global financial markets had moved as a result of the Omicron variant but had not come close to similar stress levels as seen in early 2020 when the pandemic first spread. “I don’t think it’s going to be a big stress event,” he said. Publishing the results of its annual stress tests of the banking system, Threadneedle Street said the UK’s eight biggest banks had sufficient resources to continue lending to the UK economy in a more severe downturn to the one experienced in 2020. The Bank said that it would force lenders to hold about £11bn of capital to guard against future shocks by reintroducing its “countercyclical capital buffer,” a rule which forces banks to have a sufficient cushion of capital to absorb losses. The buffer will be set at 1% with a 12-month implementation period. It said it expected to announce a further increase in the buffer to 2% – equating to about £22bn of capital – if the economy continued to recover as hoped between now and the middle of next year. Threadneedle Street cancelled its stress tests last year during the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic, saying that bank resources should be aimed at supporting households and businesses through the emergency. The tests, first undertaken in 2014, were developed after the 2008 financial crisis to determine whether the UK’s biggest banks could keep lending during a recession.",News/Business,Bank of England plans to remove interest rate check for mortgages,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/13/bank-of-england-plans-to-remove-interest-rate-check-for-mortgages

12/14/2021,"After an intense finale that divided fans and remains subject to an appeal, battle lines have been drawn. Both sides are convinced they are right, a microcosm of every cut and thrust between Max Verstappen, Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes and Red Bull this season. There is so little to choose between them, each having pushed the other to ever greater heights. For all that Hamilton was brilliant this year, especially in the final four races, Verstappen takes the honours. His first title was achieved with some controversial performances but also brilliance. In taking the fight to the best driver of this generation and winning Verstappen showed resilience and focus that can only be admired, regardless of how the finale panned out. He and Hamilton left the rest of the field behind. Watching them has been a privilege.  The comeback of the season in Sao Paulo heralding Hamilton taking the title fight to the wire. Mercedes had fitted a new engine at the Brazil GP, handing him a five-place grid penalty. When he was penalised for a damaged element of his rear wing, he found himself with, in effect, 25 places to make up. He took 15 in a mighty charge in the sprint race that determined pole, then in the race from 10th he carved through the field with the finesse of a master. He caught Verstappen by lap 19 and the pair proceeded to duel in a frenetic exchange of gripping fastest laps. They went wheel to wheel before Hamilton finally made it stick for an extraordinary win. The death of Sir Frank Williams was received with great sadness across the sport. Williams was a pioneer, an innovator and most of all a man who lived and breathed Formula One. He had devoted his life to it and enriched the sport beyond measure. The affection in which he was held by fans is clear, his team still retaining huge support even through their later, difficult years. Williams did what would be unthinkable now in Formula One. He built a team from humble beginnings that rose to enormous success, driven by a single-minded determination. Williams leaves a chasm in the sport, the last great privateer who made his mark like no other. Mercedes completed a record eighth consecutive constructors’ title but Red Bull were on fire. Battered and bruised after seven tough years, this was the first time since their last championship in 2013 that they have had a chance really to challenge for the title. It was ill-tempered but the fact that they stepped up with such professionalism and alacrity was statement to how strong a team they have forged. They executed with skill and were operationally superlative, giving Verstappen the backing he needed to take the fight to Hamilton. They were not found wanting in a battle to the end. The new sprint race format which is to be adopted at six meetings next year was at best an interesting experiment that requires a rethink. The concept of having a competitive session on a Friday was rightly welcomed, not least by race promoters and fans. However, while holding qualifying on Friday worked, downgrading it to merely setting the grid for the sprint qualifying – the race which could not be called a race – was a mistake. The single-lap discipline requires great skill as well as being a great spectacle and coming out on top should be rewarded with pole for the race. The sprints themselves were largely processional, with neither enough points nor jeopardy to encourage action. The format is to be rejigged next season, hopefully with lessons learned. Hamilton faced the toughest task of the season after his relegation to the back of the grid for the sprint race in Brazil. He then gave a masterclass in controlled, aggressive driving to pass 14 cars and move up to sixth in 23 laps. A mighty achievement crowned by his pursuit and then pass of McLaren’s Lando Norris. Throwing his car up the inside of turn one he made it to take fifth. It was the move of a driver supremely confident, executed with verve and skill. Lando Norris has proved beyond doubt his exceptional talent and potential this season. The McLaren driver delivered performances of maturity and control that belie his tender age of 22. Just three years into his Formula One career Norris has often delivered like a seasoned pro and McLaren’s operation has proved they are ready to compete with the big three, not least in Daniel Ricciardo’s win at Monza. Norris has been a standout, he has outdriven the more experienced Ricciardo and his qualifying has been exceptional. Fifth in Monaco he converted to a podium placing. In Austria he was only four-hundredths off pole in second place. And he was a mighty third in Abu Dhabi. In Russia a potential win slipped from his fingers after he brilliantly held Hamilton at bay only to be scuppered by trying to stay out on slick tyres in the rain. It was impossible not to feel for him but his chance will come again. The Belgian Grand Prix boasts one of the absolute classic circuits on the calendar in Spa but this year it played host to only farce. With heavy rain in the Ardennes all day the race was delayed again and again while fans stood stoically in the downpour in the forlorn hope of seeing some racing. This was dragged out far longer than was necessary only to end in ignominy as the cars were sent out to do two laps behind the safety car, just enough to declare a race had taken place. Bitter fans were then left to pay to have tractors tow their cars out of fields turned into quagmires, while Formula One was left looking avaricious and cynical. Formula One was following the money again by holding its debut meeting in Saudi Arabia. The country’s human rights record is so appalling Hamilton pointedly remarked he was not comfortable being there. Noises were made about the sport being a force for change – evidence of which is thin on the ground if the repeated visits to Bahrain and China are anything to go by. The race was hailed by some as one of the best of the season but was far from it. It was dramatic, without doubt, as Hamilton and Verstappen duelled but with the stewards ultimately making the decisions it was not great racing. There were two red flags but it could have been a dozen on a track specifically designed to be the fastest street circuit in the world, combining high speed with close barriers and blind corners. Several drivers called it out for what it was: dangerous. Inevitably the sport has signed a deal to race on in Saudi for another decade.",Sport/Sport,F1 season awards: Verstappen pips Hamilton again and Norris steps up | Giles Richards,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/dec/13/f1-season-awards-verstappen-pips-hamilton-again-and-norris-steps-up
12/14/2021,"The NHS was put on a crisis footing tonight as hospitals in England were told to discharge as many patients as possible while estimated daily Covid cases hit 200,000 and the Omicron variant claimed its first life in the UK. Amid a scramble for tests and booster jabs, the country’s doctors called for further restrictions to be imposed to stem the rise in cases and Downing Street did not rule out fresh measures.  In a letter to hospitals, NHS England chiefs said patients who could be discharged to care homes, hospices, their own homes or hotels before Christmas to free up beds, should be. The letter from NHS England’s chief executive, Amanda Pritchard, and medical director Prof Stephen Powis said the service was facing a level 4 “national incident”. Hotels are already being turned into temporary care facilities staffed with workers flown in from Spain and Greece to relieve rising pressure on NHS hospital beds. Hospitals and GPs have also been told to scale back normal services and limit care to those needing urgent attention so that NHS staff can be freed up to deliver boosters. Hospitals will undertake fewer non-urgent operations, but “highest clinical priority patients”, including people with cancer and those who have been waiting a long time, will be given priority. They have also been told to take ambulance-borne patients into A&E more quickly so that paramedics can get back on the road to answer more 999 calls, speed up efforts to bring in nurses from overseas to help tackle the NHS’s lack of staff, and send as many patients as possible for surgery at private hospitals. A campaign to give boosters to more than 1 million people a day got under way, prompting the NHS website to crash and people to queue in the street for up to five hours for their jabs. But the British Medical Association said the vaccination campaign would not be enough to stop the spread of Omicron, with one in four still not eligible for a booster. They called for a return to face masks in pubs and restaurants, 2-metre social distancing indoors, limits on public gatherings, legal requirements for ventilation in schools and other settings, more rapid testing and advice to wear FFP2 masks. No 10 insisted that the booster campaign was its immediate priority, with a senior government source describing the main strategy as “keep on jabbing”. But Boris Johnson refused to rule out tougher restrictions if necessary to maintain public health. No 10 said all options were still on the table, leaving open the possibility of closing schools “as a last resort” and bringing in curbs without consulting MPs “in extremis”. Addressing MPs, Sajid Javid revealed there may now be as many 200,000 UK Covid infections a day, with 20% of those likely to be the Omicron variant, and warned of “difficult weeks ahead”. In London, the centre of the Omicron outbreak, it accounted for over 44% of cases and was expected to become the dominant form within 48 hours, the health secretary said. He said Covid passports would be toughened to require people to have a booster or recent lateral flow test (LFT) in the new year, risking inflaming Tory backbench anger against restrictions ahead of Commons votes on “plan B” restrictions. Johnson is braced for his biggest rebellion as prime minister on Tuesday, with about 80 Tory MPs confirmed to be preparing to vote against measures on working from home, Covid passports and more mask wearing. He will have to rely on Labour votes for the votes to pass. Labour backed the government’s booster campaign and stopped short of calling for any new restrictions, with Keir Starmer saying it was Labour’s “patriotic duty” to vote for plan B. The prime minister confirmed the first death of a patient with Omicron and 10 people hospitalised with the variant, saying people needed to “set aside” the idea that the variant was mild. Meanwhile, head teachers warned of “chaos” in schools, with high levels of staff and pupil absences and reports that parents are planning to keep children home to avoid the virus before Christmas. On the first day of the new vaccine campaign, 386,000 people in England are understood to have booked booster jabs – almost 50,000 an hour. But there was confusion over whether all eligible over-18s would be able to get a booster by the end of the year, with No 10 insisting they would but the NHS casting doubt on the goal. Javid suggested the target was offering rather than delivering the boosters. It is understood No 10 will also launch a new effort to reach the unvaccinated, using a publicity campaign potentially involving faith leaders and celebrities. On Monday people trying to get LFTs were told they were unavailable despite a new requirement for Covid contacts to take them daily for a week. The call from the BMA for tougher restrictions echoed warnings from scientists that vaccination alone would not be able to stop Omicron causing a dangerous second wave. Leaked documents from the UK Health and Security Agency showed on Friday that public health officials believe there should be “stringent national measures” by 18 December at the latest, with sources saying plan B will not be enough. The BMA, which represents 150,000 doctors, is the first major medical organisation to call for stricter measures. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, BMA council chair, said: “Despite describing the current situation as an ‘emergency’ with a ‘tidal wave’ of infections on the horizon, the government’s response relying entirely on the vaccine booster programme is missing the wider measures required to control the spread of Omicron, including protecting millions of people who will not be eligible for the booster programme by the end of December.” No 10 has been resistant to new measures before Christmas but is planning to review the situation on 18 December.",News/World news,Covid: NHS in crisis mode as hospitals told to discharge patients where possible,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/13/covid-nhs-in-crisis-mode-as-hospitals-told-to-discharge-patients-where-possible
12/14/2021,"Mexicans are in mourning for Vicente Fernández, the elaborately mustachioed icon of ranchera music, whose ballads of love and loss, golden baritones and singular stage presence captured the raw emotions of a nation. Fans have flocked to his ranch in western Jalisco state, where family, friends and fellow crooners paid their final respects to the man known as “El Rey” (the King) – and often just by the diminutive “Chente.”  Cantina patrons broke into versions of his greatest hits, while a stadium full of fans at the national football final belted out an emotional rendition of Volver, Volver – a song of longing for lost love. Fernández died early Sunday morning, having battled illness in recent months after suffering a spinal cord injury during a fall. He had previously been diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome, an autoimmune disease which attacks the nerves. Such was Fernández’s stature that Andrés Manuel López Obrador ended his morning press conference on Monday by playing Volver, Volver. The president called Fernández, “a symbol of ranchera music, a popular singer known in Mexico and abroad and we are going to end the conference by listening to him”. US President Joe Biden tweeted: “The music world has lost an icon. The music of Vicente Fernández created memories for millions … Vicente will be remembered for generations to come.” Vicente Fernández was born 17 February 1940, in the ranching community of Huentitán el Alto. He was reputedly bit by the show-business bug after watching films starring Pedro Infante. He learned to play guitar and sang on the streets of Guadalajara – Mexico’s mariachi heartland – before hitting the big time in the mid-1960s. “He made ranchera music popular in the cities and beyond the traditional audiences. Then he took it abroad,” where it connected Mexican immigrants with their homeland, said Javier Garza, an editor and journalist in the city of Torreón. “Chente’s rise coincided with the growth of (Mexico’s) urban middle-class in the 70s and 80s.” Famed for projecting an image of virility – sporting thick sideburns, a mustache and bushy eyebrows, which were dyed black until his final days – Fernández recorded more than 50 albums and starred in more than 30 films. He received a star on Hollywood’s Walk of Fame in 1998 and concluded his farewell tour in 2016. Fernández regularly sold out stadiums, taking the stage in elaborately embroidered charro suits, cowboy boots and broad sombreros. His music won fans across Latin America and in immigrant communities north of the border. His fame didn’t always protect against the hardships of Mexican life. Fernández’s eldest son, Vicente Jr, was kidnapped in 1998 with the captors demanding a $5m ransom and chopping off two fingers. Both Vicente Jr and another son Alejandro pursued music careers. He is survived by his wife of 58 years, María del Refugio Abarca Villaseñor, with whom he had four children. In his latter years, Fernández courted controversy: he refused a liver transplant in 2019 over worries the donor might be a “homosexual”, he told the TV program De Primera Mano.",News/World news,"Mexicans pay tribute to Vicente Fernández, icon of ranchera music",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/13/vicente-fernandez-mexico-tributes-ranchera-music
12/14/2021,"Vladimir Putin has told Boris Johnson that he wants immediate talks to secure clear legal agreements that Nato will not expand eastwards. According to a Kremlin readout of the two leaders’ phone-call on Monday, Putin said talks were needed to discuss Nato’s future intentions, and to clarify Ukraine’s plans for the east of the country. The call marked the first time the two men had spoken since October before the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow. Johnson expressed the UK’s “deep concern over the buildup of Russian forces on Ukraine’s border”, and warned him “that any destabilising action would be a strategic mistake that would have significant consequences”. The British prime minister also called for the issues to be resolved through diplomatic channels.  The lengthier readout of the call from the Kremlin cited what it described as specific examples of Kyiv’s destructive disruption of the Minsk agreements, the deal that was supposed to settle the Russian-Ukraine dispute. Putin alleged that the Ukrainian authorities were deliberately exacerbating the situation on the line of contact, as well as using heavy weapons and attack drones prohibited by the Minsk Package of Measures in the conflict zone. He also claimed Russian-speaking populations were still suffering discrimination inside Ukraine. Putin said he wanted clear international legal agreements that would exclude any further Nato advance to the east, and the removal of weapons that threaten Russia in neighbouring states, primarily in Ukraine. He added Russia was preparing clear legal documents to support its demands. The leaders agreed to continue the discussion of the issues raised through various channels. It was not clear if the talks represented a material advance on the discussions held recently between Putin and the US president, Joe Biden – which themselves made little headway. Privately, leaders in the west remain confused about Putin’s intentions, but fear the level of the rhetoric and the increasingly broad demands coming from Russia are setting up the conditions for a serious threat of war – rather than merely testing western determination. It has also been suggested that Putin’s decision to test the resolve and unity of the west may have been prompted by the departure of Angela Merkel as German chancellor. The growing tensions over Ukraine have come at a time when arms control agreements and strategic stability dialogue between the two countries have been severely corroded. Russia has threatened to deploy intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe as a response to what it claims are Nato plans to do the same thing. The threat, delivered by deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, signals the potential return to the nuclear missile standoff in Europe of the 1980s, when US Pershings were ranged against Russian SS20s. In that tense period, the world came close to a nuclear war when Moscow came to believe that Nato’s Able Archer exercises in 1983 were a prelude to attack. The missiles were withdrawn after the US and the Soviet Union signed the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty in 1987. Donald Trump withdrew the US from the INF treaty in 2019 after years of US complaints that Russia was cheating by building and deploying an intermediate-range missile, the 9M729. Russia denied the charge, claiming the range of the missile was legal. Ryabkov told Russia’s RIA news agency that Moscow would deploy nuclear missiles if Nato refused to engage in talks. Nato has said it had no plans to bring nuclear missiles back to Europe, but Ryabkov said Russia had a “complete lack of trust” in the alliance, pointing to the reconstitution last month of the US 56th Artillery Command, which operated the missile batteries in Europe until it was stood down in 1991. “Lack of progress towards a political and diplomatic solution to this problem will lead to our response being of a military and technical military nature,” Ryabkov said. “They don’t permit themselves to do anything that could somehow increase our security – they believe they can act as they need, to their advantage, and we simply have to swallow all this and deal with it. This is not going to continue.” He claimed that Russia was currently observing a moratorium on intermediate range nuclear missiles, a claim Nato disputes. The US alleges Russia deployed two battalions of 9m729 missiles in 2017, one in the south-west and the other in an unknown location.",News/World news,Putin tells Boris Johnson urgent talks needed over Nato’s plans for Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/13/putin-demands-talks-over-natos-plans-for-eastern-ukraine
