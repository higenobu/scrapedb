12/21/2021,"There’s still a lot we don’t know about the omicron coronavirus variant, including whether it causes more severe COVID-19 or the degree to which it evades vaccines’ defenses in real-world settings. But early data collected in London reveals the answer to a question we’re all asking: Does omicron cause different symptoms than delta and other variants? Not quite, according to the ZOE COVID Study — an app some U.K. residents use to self-report information about their coronavirus vaccination and infections. A comparison of data from thousands of people who tested positive for COVID-19 in October when the delta variant was dominant in London compared to December when omicron took over reveals “no clear difference in early symptoms (3 days after test).” The top five reported symptoms in both periods, however, suggest the common cold you think you have may actually be COVID-19. Runny nose, headache, fatigue, sneezing and sore throat were the most common symptoms among London residents, with some people also reporting loss of appetite and brain fog, data shows. Typically, COVID-19’s “classic three symptoms” include fever, cough or loss of smell or taste, but only 50% of people in the early analysis infected with delta or omicron experienced them. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study on 43 COVID-19 patients sick with the omicron variant found cough, fatigue, congestion and runny nose were the most commonly reported symptoms. But experts warn against depending on symptoms to determine if you’re sick — and with what. “The trick is you’re not going to be able to tell the difference between omicron, delta, lambda, plain COVID from the beginning,” Dr. Emily Landon, chief hospital epidemiologist at University of Chicago Medicine, told NBC Chicago. “Influenza or even common rhinovirus causes most of our common colds in the winter. You’re not going to know the difference between those if you just look at your symptoms.” “For many people, those symptoms are overlapping,” Landon told the outlet. “You’re just not going to know especially at the beginning of an illness, what kind of illness you have. You have to get tested.” The omicron variant has been detected in at least 39 states and more than 75 countries, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said during a Dec. 17 White House COVID-19 briefing. Doctors caring for COVID-19 patients in South Africa — where the variant was first detected — said in November the omicron cases they treated at the time were mild, and mostly among younger people. Dr. Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, told BBC her omicron patients had scratchy not sore throats, and didn’t have a cough or loss of smell or taste. More recent data from the country shows the risk of hospital admission among adults infected with omicron is 29% lower than that of adults infected with the original coronavirus strain when the pandemic began in 2020. However, a study by the Imperial College London found no evidence that omicron causes less severe illness than delta, based on the proportion of infected people who report symptoms or seek hospital care. It remains unclear if omicron itself is less severe or if other factors, such as characteristics of the infected population, may play a role, experts say. Meanwhile, early studies show two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine may not protect you against omicron infection, but can against hospitalization and death; booster shots significantly increase immunity. Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief White House medical adviser, said the “seriousness of infection” with omicron is “still up in the air right now.” “Certainly, looking at what we see, it does not look like it is more severe, but we have to withhold judgment,” Fauci said during the Dec. 17 White House briefing. It’s clear omicron is more contagious than other variants, he added, especially if you look at New York, where omicron infections broke the state’s record for daily new reported cases for two consecutive days. Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, told NPR the U.S. could see 1 million new COVID-19 infections per day if we let our guards down. Experts say the best way to protect yourself against omicron is to get tested frequently, social distance, get vaccinated and boosted, and wear a face mask indoors.",Health/Miami Herald,What are symptoms of the omicron coronavirus variant?

12/21/2021,"A group of missionaries kidnapped by a gang in Haiti managed to sneak past guards during an escape. On December 15, the 12 hostages used light from the moon to walk across rugged terrain. They were part of a group of 17 hostages who were kidnapped on October 16. A group of missionaries kidnapped by a gang in Haiti managed to sneak past guards and use the light of the stars and moon to escape over rugged terrain last week, Christian Aid Ministries said on Monday. Seventeen individuals from the Ohio-based missionary group had been kidnapped on October 16 by members of the 400 Mawoza gang in Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince. Two of the hostages were released in late November, with another three getting released in early December, the Christian Aid Ministries previously said, leaving 12 still in captivity until last week. Weston Showalter, a spokesman for the agency, said during a press conference on Monday that the remaining group of 12 people — including a 10-month-old baby and 3-year-old child — made their escape during the night of December 15. Showalter said that on the night of the escape, the group of hostages put on their shoes, packed water in their clothes, and stacked their mattresses in a corner of the room where they were being held. ""When they sensed the timing was right, they found a way to open the door that was closed and blocked, filed silently to the path that they had chosen to follow, and quickly left the place that they were held — despite the fact that numerous guards were nearby,"" he said. He said the group had recognized a mountain in the distance that they identified in previous days, and understood that to be the right direction to walk. ""They also followed the sure guidance of the stars as they journeyed through the night,"" he said, and that the group relied on the moonlight while walking ""as much as 10 miles"" through rugged terrain. After walking for hours through the night, the missionaries eventually found someone who was able to help them make a phone call, Showalter said. They were then flown out of Haiti to Florida. ""They were finally free,"" he said during what was an emotional speech.

12/21/2021,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A truck crashed into several U.S. army vehicles, including two fuel tankers, that had pulled over to the side of a highway in southern Germany on Monday, setting off a blazing inferno and injuring several people, police and the U.S. military said. The driver of the truck was believed to have been killed, police said. Eight U.S. soldiers were taken to the hospital for precautionary screening, the 7th Army Training Command said, but no U.S. personnel were reported otherwise injured. A convoy of four U.S. military vehicles from the Training Command had pulled over to the side of the motorway southeast of the Bavarian city of Nuremberg when an articulated truck struck them from behind. The smash caused a multi-vehicle pileup and a blaze that engulfed several vehicles in flames and sent plumes of smoke into the sky, police said. The truck was loaded with wood chips and caught on fire, Bild newspaper cited police as saying. Two of the U.S. vehicles involved were tanker trucks but they did not explode, police said. The police said several people were injured. Rescue crews had been unable to pull the driver of the truck out of the badly damaged cab but they did not believe he had survived. Photographs from the scene showed the burnt-out wrecks of several vehicles by the foam-covered side of the road. Police said they believed the crash had been an accident. The U.S. 7th Army Training Command's Combined Arms Training Center, based in Grafenwoehr, was set up in 1948 following World War Two as part of the allied presence in Germany.
