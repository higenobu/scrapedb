1/20/2022,"The estate of Jimi Hendrix is suing the heirs of the trailblazing guitarist’s former bandmates after they allegedly threatened to sue for “millions of pounds” in unpaid royalties dating back decades, Billboard reports. In December, Lawrence Abramson, a British lawyer representing the families of the Jimi Hendrix Experience bassist David Noel Redding and drummer John Graham “Mitch” Mitchell, sent a cease-and-desist letter that claimed they owned a stake in Hendrix’s music and threatened to sue for infringement.  In a case filed on 18 January in Manhattan, the Hendrix estate and Sony Music, the exclusive licence holder of Hendrix’s catalogue, requested a legal declaration stating that they owed nothing. They said that the claims were invalid given that Redding and Mitchell signed “broad general releases” and agreements not to sue in exchange for “significant monetary consideration” after Hendrix’s death. Their lawyers claim that Redding signed in April 1973 and Mitchell in September 1974 agreeing to release the Hendrix estate from legal claims, Rolling Stone reports. The Hendrix estate and Sony said that the settlements “specifically” concerned the band’s recordings and that there had been no claim by Redding and Mitchell or their successors “for almost half a century … concerning the copyright ownership, exploitation of these recordings by plaintiffs or payments of royalties”. Hendrix and Sony are not suing for damages, but a ruling that exonerates them of the claims made by representatives for Redding and Mitchell. The Guardian contacted representatives for Redding and Mitchell’s estates, who said they could not yet comment. In the cease-and-desist letter, representatives for the Redding and Mitchell estates argued that the agreements reached in 1970 were unenforceable and that they were owed millions in royalties dating back to 1973. Hendrix formed the Jimi Hendrix Experience in 1966. They scored hits, particularly in the UK, with songs such as their cover of All Along the Watchtower and originals Voodoo Chile and Purple Haze. The group broke up in 1969 after Redding’s departure. Hendrix died in September 1970 at the age of 27. Redding died in 2003 and Mitchell in 2008. Lawyers for the group’s rhythm section claim that “both died in relative poverty having never received their true entitlement from their works, performances and founding membership of the Jimi Hendrix Experience”.",Arts/Music,Jimi Hendrix estate sues bandmates’ heirs after alleged royalties and copyright threat,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/20/jimi-hendrix-estate-sues-bandmates-heirs-after-alleged-royalties-and-copyright-threat
1/20/2022,"Downing Street is to hold talks with the artist Tracey Emin after she said one of her works should no longer hang inside No 10 because of her concerns about alleged parties inside the building. The artwork, More Passion, which has red neon lettering spelling out the words of the title, has been on display inside 10 Downing Street for a decade, since it was put there during David Cameron’s time in office.  Emin said she wanted it taken down as she felt a neon work was associated with a party atmosphere, and those in No 1o did not need “any encouragement on this level”. Asked about her request, Johnson’s spokesperson said: “My understanding is that the work was gifted to the government art collection with an agreement to initially display it in No 10. We will obviously now discuss the location of the work with the artist, and I believe it will remain part of the government art collection that displays works in a number of locations.” In an interview with BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour, Emin said reports of lockdown-breaching parties inside Downing Street has given her misgivings about its location. “I don’t want the work back, because I donated it,” she said. “I would simply like at the moment for it to be taken down, because the neon is notoriously for a party atmosphere. You have them at funfairs, casinos, bars or whatever. I really do not feel that No 10 needs any encouragement on this level.” Emin said Boris Johnson had told her he liked the work being in No 10, but added: “I want it taken down and this government, I will tell you what they need, they need compassion. That’s what they need, not passion. They don’t need more party atmosphere. “Most of us are obeying the rules in every single way because this pandemic has affected everybody, whether it is financially, whether it was health-wise, people dying or whatever. And this government doesn’t seem to care about that.” The government art collection, comprising 14,000 works, displays them in official buildings around the UK and in embassies and consulates overseas. A spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, which administers the collection, said: “When an artwork comes into the government art collection, the collection can display the work at any of its 365 locations. On occasions the collection may consult with an artist when a work is going to a specific location.”",Arts/Art and design,No 10 to talk to Tracey Emin about removal of More Passion artwork,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/20/no-10-to-talk-to-tracey-emin-about-removal-of-more-passion-artwork
1/20/2022,"Aldi is ditching grocery deliveries via Deliveroo to focus on its own home shopping service as consumers return to stores in greater numbers. About 100 of the German retailer’s 950 UK stores offered grocery orders and home deliveries through Deliveroo during the pandemic when shoppers increasingly chose to shop online.  Recent industry data has indicated a return to more normal shopping habits, with online grocery sales in December down 3.7% on the same month in 2020, and accounting for 12.2% of total groceries, compared with a peak of nearly 14% last year. During lockdowns, supermarkets including Waitrose, Morrisons, Sainsbury’s and the Co-op turned to Deliveroo to help with extra demand for home deliveries. Rapid delivery operators, including Getir, Gorillas and Zapp, have also entered the UK market. Tesco and Sainsbury’s have also been trying out their own rapid delivery services – Whoosh and Chop Chop – to take on the likes of Getir, Deliveroo, JustEat and Uber Eats. Aldi’s move, which was first reported by the Grocer trade journal, marks a first shift away from food delivery, which is seen as less profitable, particularly for low-cost retailers whose business model is based around saving costs through simplicity and efficiency. It comes after a strong Christmas for the retailer and grocers in general, helped by fears of the Omicron variant, which dampened desire for eating out at restaurants, cafes and pubs. An Aldi spokesperson said: “We have decided to end our trial with Deliveroo to focus on our click-and-collect service, which remains on offer at more than 200 of our stores nationwide.” On Thursday Deliveroo said its sales were up 36% in the three months to 31 December compared with the same period a year before and 11% ahead of the previous quarter. However, the figures showed a slowdown from the annual run-rate of 70%. It said grocery sales made up 8% of the food delivery specialist’s total in the second half of 2021, up from 6% in the same period in 2020. Will Shu, the chief executive of Deliveroo, said: “Despite a challenging backdrop, we continued to strengthen our customer proposition, widen our customer base and execute against our strategy.”",News/Business,Aldi ends Deliveroo deliveries as UK return to stores,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/20/aldi-ends-deliveroo-deliveries-online-groceries-peak
1/20/2022,"Lennie James has missed being on stage. It is where he started out and it’s still how he measures himself as an actor. But now that he is back in a rehearsal room, he’s got the jitters. “I’m petrified,” he says, a bearded head-and-shoulders on Zoom in a back room of the Old Vic theatre, London, in preparation for his part in Caryl Churchill’s two-hander A Number. The play, revived from 2002, is set in a near-future world where cloning is widespread and is structured round a series of confrontations between a father and a series of clones of his son. Exploring identity and what it means to be human, James will play the father to Paapa Essiedu’s son. “I’m more scared than I have ever been in my life … I don’t know what made me think it was a good idea but I was very much looking to be challenged, and this play certainly does that.”  Now 56, James has come to be better known for his TV work, from Jed Mercurio’s Line of Duty (he played the fatally flawed DCI Tony Gates in the first series, which some still consider to be the best) to Morgan Jones in the post-apocalyptic dramas The Walking Dead and Fear the Walking Dead, and Nelly Rowe, another flawed hero, in Save Me. But the old muscle memory is twitching back to life, he says, and the pace of theatre affords him more thinking time, compared with the riptides of episodic TV drama where rehearsals are a luxury – “If you’re doing 16 episodes a season you’re getting a new script every eight days or so.” He was asked to be in A Number twice by two different directors, both times opposite Essiedu, so there is a certain serendipity to this theatre comeback after a 15-year gap. “One [director] came through me saying: ‘It should be you and Paapa.’ Another came through Paapa saying: ‘It should be you and Lennie.’ It makes it hard to say no because, whatever the experience turns out to be, the universe is trying to put the two of us together.” What does it mean, if anything, that both characters in Lyndsey Turner’s production are men of colour? “As far as I’m concerned, it is the story of all the things it’s about but it’s also the story of two Black men and the story of a Black father and a Black son. That’s only because it can’t be anything else – it’s me and Paapa.” James’s background in foster care has been well documented, and he drew on it in 2000 when he wrote the Bafta-nominated drama Storm Damage, about a teacher returning to the children’s home in which he grew up. James’s mother died when he was 10 years old after a long-term illness. He was taken into a children’s home in Tooting, south London, with his older brother, and later placed with a foster mother and siblings. He wrote the drama to “pay homage to my foster mother”, who set up a home after discovering that some children were getting lost within the system. “I was trying to tell the story of the first two years of my foster mother’s kids’ home and what it did to us as a family as well as what it did to the kids that came through.” The acting has always run in tandem with the writing. He performed in his first play at 16 but wrote a play just a year later that won a National Youth Theatre competition and was published by Faber. He has, in the past, talked whimsically of catching the acting bug after following a girl he liked into an audition. Was that really what set him off? It was more a search for belonging, he suggests, which he found on stage: “I went to an all-boys school, and if you could name a sport, we had a team for it. You didn’t have an identity unless you were picked for a team, even if that was the chess club. “When I did my first play [Just Good Friends] at the Cockpit theatre in Marylebone, central London, I got stopped walking across the road by the show’s choreographer, Karen Rabinowitz, who said: ‘Are you going to do this again, Lennie? … I think you can do it and I think you can do it professionally.’” So you were picked for the team? “That’s exactly what it felt like to me. That’s all I needed.” He saved up to pay for his auditions and got into two drama schools – the Guildhall School of Music & Drama and Rada – but decided to go to the former when he realised he would be the only Black student in his year at Rada compared with three others at Guildhall. Still, he felt adrift at first. “Yes, it was lonely and I felt very vulnerable, very out of my depth. I had gone to drama school because I felt like I knew nothing about the profession and I went there to learn.” He felt pigeonholed as the “working-class Black guy” but luckily, because the school had a jazz course, he found affinity with some of the musicians. “There was the Reggae Philharmonic, the Jazz Warriors, Steve Williamson and the girls who played the violin in Soul II Soul. Bryn Terfel was there and we’d go for a drink with him … I spent quite a lot of time hanging out with them all in the basement.” He was a jobbing actor for the next two decades, but just before he turned 40 he left for LA. Why? “I had done at least one lead in a television show and a number of leads on stage. I was being told that I should be satisfied with that because that was a definition of success over here for someone who – as I took it – looked like me. I just wasn’t willing to let somebody else decide what my ambition should be. I wanted to challenge myself as an actor, to see what was possible. I landed there when I was a relative grownup and I seemed to arrive at the right time; it went stupidly well for me immediately.” Does he think an actor of colour would need to leave Britain for better parts today? “I don’t think we’ve got there but I do think the options for actors of colour are broader than they were. The UK has opened itself up a little bit to the possibility of us. I was part of a generation where it was accepted, particularly in television, that we weren’t necessarily representative of universal stories. I remember a friend who was on a long-running television show. He’s a Black actor and his character had had a number of love interests who had been exclusively white. He went to producers and said: ‘Why don’t we have someone who is Black next time?’ He was told: ‘We can’t have a Black-on-Black relationship because audiences won’t identify.’ That statement, I don’t believe, would be made by anybody in British television in 2022.” James has three daughters with his wife, Giselle Glasman, whom he met in youth theatre back in the day. Given that he has successfully hammered down the doors but knows the strain of it all too well, how would he feel if they wanted to go into the business? “Two of them are in it, behind the scenes, and one of them isn’t. I’m fine with that. I work in a profession that, ultimately, you do because your heart can’t let you do something else. So if my girls want to work in this industry, it’s got to be because they really want to and they can sustain themselves through the ups and the downs. So far, they’re managing that, and I’m exceptionally proud of all of them.” There is also the significant but absent influence of his mother in his life. Was she a natural performer? It’s hard to say because he knew her only as a child knows their mother, but there are some clues to the woman she might have been that he recounts tenderly. “She used to sing at church on her own and I had a photograph of her on the boat, coming from Trinidad to England, where she is in the middle of the dancefloor. No one else is on it and she’s just dancing up a storm.” Would she be surprised at how her youngest son turned out? “She would be shocked. I was a shy, quiet kid. I’d spend a lot of time curled up behind her legs on the couch. There wasn’t any real sense that Lennie then was going to end up being an actor. She’d be less shocked if it was my brother because he was much less shy then.” He has stayed close to his brother, who works on building sites and DJs at the weekends. “He’s like one of those old roving DJs of our youth, who sets up in a pub and plays Barry White.” He must be immensely proud of his famous sibling. “The thing about my family is that there’s not a huge allowance made for the fact that I’m the fella on the telly. There’s a minute of: ‘Oh look, you’re back [from LA],’ and then: ‘The bins need taking out.’” A Number is at the Old Vic, London, 24 January to 19 March.",Arts/Culture,Lennie James: ‘I wasn’t willing to let somebody else decide what my ambition should be’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/20/lennie-james-i-wasnt-willing-to-let-somebody-else-decide-what-my-ambition-should-be
1/20/2022,"The personal library of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the late US supreme court judge who became a liberal and feminist icon for championing women’s rights, is being auctioned. Among more than 1,000 books from Ginsburg’s collection are legal textbooks from her student days, literature, feminist classics, and works by her fellow supreme court justices.  A highlight of the online sale, which runs until 27 January, is Ginsburg’s personal and heavily annotated copy of 1957-58 Harvard Law Review, from the year she was a member. Another is a first edition of the feminist pioneer Gloria Steinem’s memoir My Life on the Road, inscribed: “To dearest Ruth – who paved the road for us all – with a lifetime of love and gratitude – Gloria.” Catherine Williamson, the head of the book department at Bonhams, which is selling the collection, said: “A person’s library can give us a sense of who the individual is and how she came to be. Justice Ginsburg’s library is no different, as it records her evolution from student (and voracious reader) to lawyer and law professor, to judge and finally, justice of the United States supreme court. “The books Justice Ginsburg chose to keep on her own bookshelf showcase the rich inner and intellectual life of one of the most influential women in recent American history.” Ginsburg, who died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 87 in September 2020, was only the second woman appointed to the US supreme court. She was nominated by Bill Clinton in 1993, and was known as a champion of gender equality and women’s rights and a defender of civil liberties. The vacancy she left on the supreme court bench was filled by a conservative judge, Amy Coney Barrett, nominated by Donald Trump in one of his last acts before losing the presidential election in November 2020. The sale includes books, photographs and ephemera dating from Ginsburg’s years as a law student through to her years at the supreme court. Among the novels are Catcher in the Rye, Lady Chatterley’s Lover and works by Tolstoy and De Tocqueville. Kate Millet’s Sexual Politics and books by Susan Sontag and Erica Jong are among feminist literary classics in the collection. A copy of Toni Morrison’s Beloved is inscribed by the author to Ginsburg and her husband. A copy of Ginsburg’s own book, My Own Words, a collection of writings taking in gender equality, opera, being Jewish and the workings of the supreme court, has an estimate of between $1,000 and $2,000.",News/US news,Law books and feminist classics in Ruth Bader Ginsburg library up for auction,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/20/law-books-and-feminist-classics-in-ruth-bader-ginsburg-library-up-for-auction
1/20/2022,"Care homes have warned that staff with Covid must not be allowed to return to work despite this week’s announcement by the health secretary, Sajid Javid, that legal self-isolation requirements are to be lifted across England. Barchester, one of the UK’s largest care home operators, said it would defy any attempt to weaken self-isolation rules for staff.  Barchester’s chief executive, Pete Calveley said: “I don’t care what the government says, we are going to make sure we do a risk assessment on every individual. [Lifting self-isolation] is probably fine for the general public but not for care homes.” Announcing “we must learn to live with Covid, in the same way we have to live with flu,” Javid said on Wednesday: “We’re looking to replace legal requirements on self-isolation with advice and guidance.” But with Omicron remaining highly infectious and deaths from the latest variant still rising, social care providers are being cautious and demanding clarification from the government. There were 194 deaths from Covid notified by England’s care homes in the week ending 14 January, up from 133 the previous week and the highest level since the beginning of March 2021 when the devastating Delta wave was receding from social care. Mike Padgham, chair of the Independent Care Group who operates care homes in Yorkshire, said: “I can’t see it changing for us for some time. It is still dangerous. I think there will be face masks and PPE in care homes for several more months. The only concession I can see coming is more visitors than the three [that are currently allowed].” While lifting self-isoaltion could help with a severe staffing crisis in social care which is being exacerbated by Covid infections among workers, care operators have a duty to keep residents safe and also fear taking risks that could breach their insurance terms. The National Care Forum, which represents not-for-profit care homes, estimates that its members are working with only two-thirds of the staff they need when vacancies are added to sickness absence. Vacancy rates have almost doubled since April and now stand at 11% in England, the Care Quality Commission regulator said this week. “We will test people on day five and six and if they are negative they can return to work,” said Calveley, who oversees 250 care homes. “If not, they can’t”. Barchester said there needs to be further analysis of the mortality caused by Omicron in care homes before it lifts the requirement for staff to self-isoate, but that could be possible in the future. Nadra Ahmed, executive chairman of the National Care Association, which represents independent care operators, said lifting self-isolation advice for care staff could leave operators liable if it resulted in infections of residents. “How does this impact on infection, especially with Omicron which is so infectious and the spread is greater?” she said. “Are we saying that in a care setting now we are not worrying about infections?” On Thursday, the Department of Health and Social Care was unable to clarify what the plan to lift the requirement for people with Covid to self-isolate means for care workers. Vic Rayner, executive director of the National Care Forum, said: “We need to understand what are the stages to get from where we are now with isolation and funding to support staff who are isolating to what appears to be a move to a discretionary position. The government needs to be really clear in advance about what this will mean for those working in health and care, and not leave it till the last gasp to outline a workable situation.”",News/World news,‘Dangerous’ to lift self-isolation rules for England’s care home staff ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/20/dangerous-to-lift-self-isolation-rules-for-uk-care-home-staff
1/20/2022,"Almost £1.2bn worth of fruit, veg and bread is binned in the UK every year, with one in five consumers stating the reason they waste so much is they “don’t know what to cook”. Close to 76m items – an average of nearly three a household – are thrown away every week, according to data based on research by the Censuswide, which asked consumers how much food they threw away. The scale of the waste is staggering, with 914m potatoes, 733m tomatoes and 728m carrots ending up in dustbins each year.  More than half of the 2,000 consumers polled on behalf of Sainsbury’s admitted they felt guilty about the amount of food they threw away. A fifth, however, explained the reason they wasted so much was they did not know what to cook. A similar proportion said they could reduce their food waste if they knew more recipes. The issue of food waste is coming to the fore as households, hit with rising shopping and energy bills, struggle to make ends meet. The habit is also terrible for the planet because of the high greenhouse gas emissions associated with food production. Sainsbury’s said the average UK household threw away 142 carrots, onions, tomatoes, courgettes, potatoes and loaves of bread a year. Nevertheless, the survey found Britons started 2022 with ambitions to mend their ways, with one in five resolving to cut their food waste and one in 10 aiming to bring down their carbon footprint and buy secondhand products. To help shoppers tackle food waste the supermarket is promoting recipes for easy-to-make and affordable soups that use up vegetables that might otherwise get chucked out. The recipes include soups such as roasted tomato and pepper, and pea and leek, which it says can feed a family of four for under £5. Mark Given, the chief marketing officer at Sainsbury’s, said there was a common misconception that making soup from scratch was difficult. “We’re determined to show our customers that this isn’t the case whilst providing them with healthier options that will help them reduce their food waste, one bowl at a time.”",News/Environment,UK consumers ‘don’t know what to cook’ as £1.2bn of food is binned a year,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/20/uk-food-waste-dont-know-what-to-cook
1/20/2022,"The reopening of Australia’s most isolated state has been suspended indefinitely to allow West Australians to get booster shots, as the more transmissible Omicron variant rips through the nation. Just one month after promising that from 5 February double-vaccinated interstate and international travellers would be allowed to enter Western Australia without quarantine, the WA premier, Mark McGowan, has said that all entrants will need to self-isolate for 14 days, be triple-dose vaccinated and take tests.  “From 12.01am on Saturday 5 February, the hard border will stay, with new settings that will have a focus on both safety and compassion,” McGowan said. The premier did not provide a new date for when quarantine-free travel would be allowed into WA. However, the list of people exempt from the hard borders will increase. People attending funerals, court, visiting those in palliative care or who are terminally ill, or those with strong recent connections, will now be allowed into the state after testing and quarantine. McGowan labelled the Omicron Covid spread a “new state of emergency” but said the border rules would be reviewed during the coming weeks. “Unfortunately, the world changed in December, Omicron arrived,” he said. “It would be irresponsible and reckless for the state government to ignore the facts and ignore the reality of the situation playing out on the east coast. “Allowing hundreds or thousands of Omicron-infected people to fly straight into Perth from 5 February with no testing, no quarantine and no public health measures would cause a flood of Covid across our state. It would cause a surge in cases, a surge in hospitalisations, and result in thousands of people not being able to work or go to school. We know that bad health outcomes lead to economic pain.” Under the new rules, international travellers will be required to quarantine in a hotel for seven days and at home for seven. McGowan said the decision was based on research showing that people who received a third dose of vaccine were 64% protected against infection compared with just 4% protection when inoculated twice. He did not cite the source of the research. “In addition, protection against severe disease is maintained at 80% to 90% for people with two doses, but increases to 98% for people with three doses,” he said. For two years, as the Covid pandemic has stretched hospitals and killed millions across the globe, WA has remained isolated from the nation, and the world, and has been mostly virus-free. WA has a third dose rate of just 28% – by 5 February that rate is expected to climb to between 35 and 38%. It is unknown when the state will hit the new 80% or 90% triple-vaccination goalpost, but McGowan said it would take some time. Perth airport has 45 flights scheduled for 5 February and the tourism council chief executive, Evan Hall, said the industry had been taking bookings, recruiting staff and securing supplies for the reopening. Thousands of passengers were due to fly into Perth airport on 5 February. The surprise announcement came as the Australian Nursing Federation state secretary, Mark Olson, pushed for the opening to be delayed. There are 79 confirmed active cases in WA. Of these, 23 are in hotel quarantine and 56 are in self-quarantine. No cases are currently in hospital. McGowan labelled the Omicron variant an unforeseen catastrophe and said he was watching what was happening on the other side of the nation, citing surging cases in New South Wales. “I mean, does anyone deny what’s going on over there is not that? People aren’t going to work, hospitals are overflowing, hundreds of people are dying, and the state’s ICUs have got huge numbers of people, lots of people on ventilators.” WA’s safe transition plan, which was announced in November, set the way for the state’s reopening based on Delta variant. That plan has been replaced. “If we can hold back this current Omicron outbreak, we will be one of the only places in the world that can achieve a high third dose rate before we reach widespread community transmission – something worth striving for,” McGowan said. “It is worth saving lives, reducing hospitalisations and limiting the number of people with Covid and becoming very ill.”",News/Australia news,Reopening of Western Australia suspended amid Omicron spread,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/20/reopening-western-australia-suspended-covid-omicron-spread
1/20/2022,"The Sun has baffled social media users with a Thursday edition front page that appears to be attempting to support Boris Johnson via a pie-chart made with a real pork pie, and the pun headline that Johnson is “crust” ahead.  The pie is divided into three sections, labelled “End of Covid rules”, “Partygate inquiry” and “Revolting MPs”. The largest potion of the pie – presumably the positive news in the paper’s view that Covid restrictions in England are ending – has an arrow pointing to some mustard saying “Cutting the mustard”. On the other side a different label suggests that the prime minister is still “in a pickle”. As one observer noted, that’s not really how pie charts work. And as another noted, it’s not really clear how they got there anyway. Some credited it to the famous “boffins” that the tabloid often refers to in any story featuring scientists. Several people on social media linked the bizarre front page to the fact that the newspaper’s deputy editor – James Slack – is himself implicated in the “partygate” scandal, having been forced to issue an apology for a Downing Street party held in his honour during Covid restrictions as he left his role as Johnson’s head of communications. Others likened it to something out of the Chris Morris television news satire, The Day Today, in particular one scene where Morris stands in front of a similarly bizarre chart. pic.twitter.com/Ykl3llaDyj The reported attempt to oust the prime minister by a group of Tory MPs who had been elected in 2019 in the “red wall” seats has been named the “pork pie plot” by supporters of Johnson. Ostensibly, it refers to the fact that Alicia Kearns is one of the more prominent figures, and she is the MP for Rutland and Melton, which includes Melton Mowbray where the famous pork pies are made. However, some observers have noted that it carries more than a whiff of snobbery about it, looking down on newly elected Conservative MPs from the north of England.

1/20/2022,"The little steel bulbs that litter parks, roadsides and city centres – the discarded canisters from Britain’s second favourite drug, laughing gas – cause misery to many communities. But now one blacksmith has found an innovative use for them: turning them into handmade kitchen knives. The prevalence of the canisters has prompted some councils to impose local bans, while the home secretary is keen to outlaw them nationally. But Tim Westley’s handmade kitchen knives are gaining a cult following among environmentally conscious foodies after being endorsed by chefs committed to low waste.  Since promising to make at least two-thirds of his blades from empty “nos” canisters, Westley knives are selling in record time on his website, Clement Knives. “I usually make about five a week, and when they go on the site there’s a rush to buy them, especially in the run-up to Christmas. This week it was only two or three minutes before they were all gone,” he said. “I’d like to think customers are buying them because they like the zero-waste concept rather than that they just want a knife.” Westley, 33, a former artist-in-residence at London’s Museum of Water & Steam, moved his forge to south-west Scotland last year. He has always been committed to knife making using recycled materials, including metal dredged from canals with magnets. Then, on walks with his dog, Mayday, he became troubled by the sight of littered piles of canisters, and worried that they posed a risk to cyclists of skidding. Last year his friend Douglas McMaster, the founder of Silo, the UK’s first zero-waste restaurant, challenged Westley to recycle the canisters into knives. The resulting experiment proved such a success that Westley has promised to only use recycled canisters for all his blades. For the handles he uses recycled plastic. According to Home Office figures, nitrous oxide, or laughing gas, is the second most popular drug among 16- to 24-year-olds, behind cannabis. The government is consulting on making the possession of laughing gas a crime. However, the drug charity Release has cautioned against criminalising what is a relatively benign substance if heavy use is avoided. But there is consensus that laughing gas’s popularity has created an ugly littering problem. Westley is doing his bit to reduce this modern form of waste, using traditional blacksmiths’ techniques. For a typical 210mm blade he uses 10 nos canisters in a process he says is laborious but worthwhile. He first cuts off the ends of the canisters with an angle grinder, then opens and flattens them with a hammer on an anvil. The flattened pieces of soft steel are then forge welded on either side of a harder carbon steel used for the sharpened edge. Westley said: “It’s call San Mai, which has been used for years by Japanese knife makers. They use two soft layers of steel around a hard steel in the middle. The only difference is that I use nos canisters for the soft steel. It’s using an ancient technique to address a modern problem.” He added: “It is more hassle, but it’s worth it because we should be using more of the materials we already have. My knives are just as good, if not better, made with materials found off the street. And there is no industrial processes involved, so there is zero waste.” In fact, Westley says the knives use more waste than they create. All the steel off-cuts go to a scrap metal dealer and the worn sanding belts used for polishing the blades are turned into plant pots. Westley gave the first nos canister knife he made to McMaster and has been supplying his restaurant with knives ever since. McMaster said they equalled any knife he had used, despite their grungy appearance caused by the recycled materials involved. His chef colleagues at the low-waste London pizzeria Crate are also using them, and McMaster is planning to feature Westley’s knives on his Zero Waste Cooking School YouTube channel.",News/Environment,Blacksmith recycles canisters into cult kitchen knives for zero-waste foodies,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/20/blacksmith-recycles-canisters-into-cult-kitchen-knives-for-zero-waste-foodies
1/20/2022,"A Belgian-British teenager has flown into the record books by becoming the youngest woman to fly solo around the world. Zara Rutherford, 19, touched down at Kortrijk-Wevelgem airport in Flanders just after 1pm local time on Thursday, completing a 52,000km (28,100 nautical mile) journey that took in 31 countries across five continents.  “It’s just really crazy. I haven’t quite processed it,” Rutherford, draped in British and Belgian flags, told reporters. She said there had been “amazing moments”, but also times when she had feared for her life. “I’d say the hardest part was flying over Siberia, because it was just extremely cold. It was minus 35 degrees on the ground … If the engine were then to stop, I’m hours away from rescue and I don’t know how long I could survive.” Making a smooth landing on the runway, she became the first woman to fly around the world in a microlight and the first Belgian to circumnavigate the globe solo by air. Rutherford’s parents are pilots and started taking her up in small planes when she was a toddler. By the age of 14 she was learning to fly and dreaming of a round-the-world trip. “The dream was really to fly around the world. But I always thought it was impossible: it’s expensive, dangerous, complicated, a logistical nightmare,” she said in a TV interview earlier this month. “So I never really thought about it twice. And then I was finishing school and I thought: if I am going to do something crazy with my life this is the perfect time to do it.” On 18 August last year she took off in her two-seater Shark Aero, one of the fastest lightweight aircraft in the world, which can reach speeds of up to 300km/h. Flying west, she stopped in the UK, Greenland, the Americas, Russia, looped down to south-east Asia, north to India, the Middle East, Egypt and back to Europe. Unable to fly at night or in clouds, Rutherford could only fly during clear daylight. She encountered all weathers, including conditions she had never been trained to deal with in temperate Belgium. There were freezing temperatures in Greenland, Alaska and Russia, desert haze in Saudi Arabia, thunderstorms at the equator, wildfires over California and smog over India that reduced visibility. Russia was her toughest challenge but also one of the highlights. “One of the most impressive moments was flying over Siberia, because it is just so remote and I don’t know if I’ll ever get to see it again,” she said. Saudi Arabia also stood out as “really beautiful, very diverse and the weather was great”. A snowstorm grounded her in the north-eastern Russian city of Magadan for a week. Extreme weather also forced a three-week stay in Ayan, a small town of 800 people in the country’s far east, with few English speakers and no wifi. Locals were “very kind and willing to help”, she said. Rutherford also had to navigate fast-changing Covid restrictions and bureaucracy. She cancelled a stop in China after a government change of rules meant she would have had to quarantine. This became one of the scariest moments of the trip, when she had to navigate one of the busiest aviation routes in the world to reach South Korea while avoiding Chinese and North Korean airspace. Her journey from Mumbai to Dubai was a gruelling eight-hour flight mostly over water, ending with a diversion to another airport 60 miles south of the Emirati city because of a rare storm. Then there were routine chores. Christmas Day in Singapore was spent dealing with a flat tyre. When she was stuck in Alaska waiting for her Russian visa, she worked on plane maintenance and applying to universities. Now back in Belgium, she plans to study electrical engineering and hopes to become an astronaut. The teenager, who cites her inspirations as the American aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart and the Russian cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, said she hoped her journey would encourage more girls to take up science and engineering. “Growing up I didn’t really see many female pilots or female computer scientists,” she has said. “Those are two of my passions and it’s quite discouraging when there is no one that you can relate to that does any of those things.” She said she hoped “other girls see me and think: ‘I’d love to fly one day, too.’”",News/World news,Belgian-Briton Zara Rutherford is youngest woman to fly solo around world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/20/belgian-briton-zara-rutherford-is-youngest-woman-to-fly-solo-around-world
