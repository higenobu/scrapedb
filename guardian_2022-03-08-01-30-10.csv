3/8/2022,"The UK should “mobilise an army of volunteers” to transform the country’s energy landscape and reduce its dependence on Russian fossil fuel by setting up community energy groups, say campaigners. With energy prices rising, local schemes such as solar panels, locally-funded wind farms and even hydroelectric dams could be crucial to helping generate energy. John Taylor, the energy projects manager at Energy Hub, argues that the UK should be convening local groups that can help give advice on grants for insulation and heat pumps, set up community-owned renewable projects, and help with insulation. “Volunteers can be provided with thermal imaging cameras to go door to door,” he suggested. They can help “identify cold spots and installing simple measures like draft proofing and radiator panels. They can also help set heating controls and lower boiler flow temperatures.” He also suggests that community groups can “run a village survey to find out who needs items like DIY loft insulation and draft proofing kits. Then order them wholesale to get bulk discounts and deliver them to a community centre or village hall for people to collect.” Taylor told the Guardian: “When it comes to the climate emergency and the current gas crisis, people don’t just want to be spectators, they want to be involved in the solutions. Next winter is shaping up to be an unprecedented challenge, so it’s vital we insulate and fit renewables to as many homes as possible over the next next months.” Local authorities and energy hubs have access to government grants for such schemes. Taylor added: “Mobilising an army of volunteers to help find homes who most need help would have an immediate and positive impact; community energy groups can bring that really important element of trust for referring vulnerable people to these official grant programmes.” Unlike other energy businesses, these community schemes are owned by the people who live near the infrastructure, and can profit from the energy provided. “When it comes to larger projects like solar and wind farms, it’s important to remember that community energy groups are businesses like other developers, but they’re democratically owned by the people who will live alongside this new infrastructure,” Taylor explained. “The revenues from power sales stay with those communities and can be reinvested in other services they really need like rural electric buses fuel poverty alleviation, and upgrading schools and community buildings. During the Covid lockdown, Ferry Farm Community Solar in West Sussex donated £40,000 to local food banks.” Infrastructure communities have a stake in could be a more palatable way to reach the onshore renewables targets required to reach net zero by 2050. This is because those who live nearby can profit from them and have a say in how and where they are built. “If communities are empowered to be proactive in designing and developing their own schemes, whether on their own or in partnership with commercial developers, not only will we see a greater acceptance for these schemes, we will see a multiplier/levelling up effect as millions in community benefit funds start flowing into grassroots projects all across the country,” Taylor said. One group of people in Oxford has managed to harness their local river to provide enough hydroelectric energy to power 55 homes a year. However, critics of the government’s policy including Conservative MP Philip Dunne, who chairs the environmental audit committee, have said the current schemes are not sufficient. This is because energy generated has to be sold back to the grid, rather than used directly to power the nearest homes, which makes the idea less attractive to communities and results in waste. South-east - Enborne Parish Field Solar Farm – a small solar farm on charity-owned land. Original purpose of the charity was to use land to grow firewood to distribute to the poor of the village.

3/8/2022,"In the sample clues below, the links take you to explainers from our beginners series. The setter’s name often links to an interview with him or her, in case you feel like getting to know these people better. Writing today, not knowing what we will wake up to on Monday morning when you might read this, I feel that these pages – which often begin with topical allusions – are probably best used as an alternative to current affairs. It was a similar feeling two years ago. So, some recommendations: first, a puzzle celebrating an anniversary. If a puzzle starts to allude to something, it’s worth checking to see whether there’s more hiding in the grid. That goes double if the edges of the grid look like Sticklebricks, as in Philistine’s sweary message of 2019. It goes triple if the setter is Gaff, who, as we learned in our Q&A, is fond of themes and anniversaries. So after this clue … 22a Fixed fees to end a novel (4,2,4)[ definition: title of a novel ][ wordplay: anagram of (“fixed”) FEESTOENDA ] … for EAST OF EDEN, we spot more from the same author, born 120 years ago: Likewise, it’s easy enough to spot some of the thematic names in Brummie’s puzzle with this clue … 10a One wearing jumper to show lover (5)[ definition: lover ][ wordplay: synonym for “one” inside (“wearing”) an animal that jumps (“jumper”) ][ ME inside ROO ] … for ROMEO, but there is much more: I’m sure I’ve missed some. As with all the Guardian’s prize puzzles, there is an annotated solution that dissects every clue. You can trace the origins of the cryptic crossword back to the Observer of the 1920s. Space was made in the paper, filled for 13 years by Torquemada, another three decades by Ximenes … and the remaining 50 years – week in, week out – by the remarkable Azed: The Observer’s three compilers form a sort of Socrates-Plato-Aristotle of cryptic crosswords … Torquemada essentially invents the form, Ximenes codifies it and Azed perfects it. It’s the perfect time to try those weekend crosswords with no black squares. Here’s our intro; here’s our Meet the Setter with Azed; here’s a solvers’ community and here’s the Observer piece in which the quote above – from setter/solver John Finnemore – appears. Nutmeg is typically evocative in her clue … 3d Obsessive leading lady departs in state (5)[ definition: obsessive ][ wordplay: abbrev for the Queen (“leading lady”) & abbrev. for “departs” (eg on a timetable), both inside (“in”) abbrev for an American state ][ ER & D, inside NY ] … for NERDY, a word which unlike “geeky” has not been widely reclaimed, perhaps because of its uglier sound. Some have suggested that NERD came about when someone said “drunk” backwards to disguise their meaning. Guesses that a word might be backslang tend to be wishful thinking; certainly NERD reached many more eyes and ears in 1950 when it appeared in If I Ran the Zoo by the man who pronounced his name differently to everyone else, Dr Seuss: And then, just to show them, I’ll sail to Ka-TrooAnd Bring Back an It-Kutch, a Preep and a Proo,A Nerkle, a Nerd, and a Seersucker, too! The rest of Seuss’s coinages above have, sadly, not entered the lexicon; although others have. In 1953, he recalled receiving a dollar from a reader whose toddler had spilled Merthiolate (an antiseptic) on the living-room rug, insisting that – just like in The Cat in the Hat Comes Back – the problem could be remedied using Voom. If Seuss was out of Voom, the correspondent went on, she would take a dollar’s worth of Oobleck, the substance in Bartholomew and the Oobleck, which lives on in classrooms as a name for the mixture of cornflour and water used by teachers to explain non-Newtonian fluids to primary school children with stains on their jumpers. Seuss’s other great gift to the language is the subject of our next challenge: reader, how would you clue GRINCH? Many thanks for your clues for GRIMP, an unbeautiful word you wouldn’t be surprised to see in the title of a Seuss story. I tend to agree with PeterMooreFuller’s remark “with a word like this I really think you have to give the letters somehow in the wordplay”, the solver needing crossing letters too. Thank you for persevering, especially to our runners-up, Etymon’s kind “Black Prince’s mount, long put out to grass” and Dunnart’s clever “Climb undertaken by procession of pilgrims?”; the winner is Albery’s even kinder “Starts to generate rhythm in musical’s pentatonic scale”.

3/8/2022,"The Canadian city of Edmonton may soon be hogtied with a problem that it won’t be able to barbecue its way out of. Wild pigs have been spreading across central Alberta’s prairies and if left unchecked, could soon find themselves in the river valley of Edmonton. According to Ryan Brook, a University of Saskatchewan professor studying the pigs, the creatures are an “ecological trainwreck” and would cause “absolute destruction” if they make their way to the river valley, which is abundant in water and forest cover. “They tear up the forest floor, native grasslands get destroyed, wetlands, water systems. They feed on anything where they can, and will kill any pets, for sure,” Brook told the Edmonton Journal. “Wild pigs are the worst invasive wild mammal on the planet – I don’t think there’s any debate about that.” As omnivores, the pigs will eat virtually anything, including squirrels, birds, eggs, roadkill, live deer and pets. Weighing up to 100kg, the pigs sustain blistering winters by building “pigloos”, or burrows that they heap with cattail plants. “They wallow in wetlands and tear them up to make their nests … They contaminate water with mud and pathogens, they destroy crops, they are a public safety hazard and they can transmit disease to humans, pets, livestock and wildlife,” Brook said. The pigs can severely jeopardize the livelihood of native wildlife. In addition to competing with native species such as deer and wild turkey, the pigs often beat coyotes to the scene of a kill. They can also carry 89 diseases including the African swine fever. Another illness, foot and mouth disease, has been estimated by the Alberta Invasive Species Council to cost upwards of $51b in national exports if it spreads to meat products and causes an outbreak. In addition, wild pigs have been linked to the decline of 22 plant species and four amphibian species. Last May, the Alberta Invasive Species Council launched the Squeal on Pigs campaign in an attempt to control the pigs’ spread. The campaign urges residents to report wild pig sightings to authorities so they “can make plans to eliminate entire sounders [a group of wild pigs] at once”. The campaign comes after researchers found that hunting individual pigs was only making the problem worse as it gave the rest of the pigs a chance to change their habits. Despite the provincial government’s campaign, Edmonton officials do not have a plan to deal with the pigs, should they begin invading the city, according to a city spokesperson, Chrystal Coleman. “You can ignore wild pigs all you want until you can’t ignore them. Then they’re at your doorstep and literally showing up in your house and coming into cities,” he said. “You cannot dabble in wild pig eradication. You either go in full hog and go hard and remove them, but you need a strategy,” warned Brook. According to Mike Bodenchuk, a biologist at the US Department of Agriculture, the pigs are able to adapt to urban environments. They have been found sleeping under car shades, knocking over headstones in city cemeteries and eating pet food. The pigs also scavenge through trash which exposes garbage and in turn attracts birds, thus creating issues for nearby airports and seaports. “It’s hard to imagine you can damage trash, but you can … if we don’t cover it deep enough, the pigs will dig it and eat that trash and it opens up to birds coming in,” Bodenchuk told the Edmonton Journal. “You cannot barbecue your way out of this problem,” he added.",News/World news,"Wild Canadian pigs threaten ‘total destruction’ if left unchecked, say experts",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/wild-pigs-feared-absolute-destruction-canada
3/8/2022,"One and a half million desperate Ukrainian refugees. Fifty British visas. It beggars belief. In time of war we should keep emotional responses in proportion, but sometimes the hypocrisy is intolerable. Boris Johnson is frantically – and blatantly – traipsing his Churchill act through the capitals of Europe. He hurls abuse at Vladimir Putin and promises Ukraine guns and missiles, aid and sanctions, persecution of oligarchs, anything short of soldiers. But when asked to do the one concrete thing that might directly relieve that country’s agony, he reverts to type. For god’s sake keep these Ukrainians away from our shores. Remember the ark of the Brexit covenant. Across Europe, EU countries have thrown open their doors. Thousands of families have literally done so. There are no border guards, wire fences, sheafs of documents and demands for proof of identity and health. These people are frantic. They could soon be spreading out across Europe. Obviously most will be temporary and most will want to stay within reach of their homes. But that still leaves tens of thousands begging for refuge farther west, many in England as they speak the language. When the surge began Johnson won headlines by promising to let in 200,000 “eligible” Ukrainians. It turned out that “eligible” meant only those with direct, immediate relatives, though even this didn’t include the parents of anyone over 18. Only after an eruption in the House of Commons did Johnson make what he presented as a grand concession, to include grandparents. By the weekend it emerged that of 5,535 laboriously completed online applications, just 50 had been granted. More than 1,000 have already entered the much smaller Republic of Ireland. It is obscene. The factory of excuses has been working overtime. There is talk of Ukrainians “not really wanting to be permanently settled here” and of the need to submit them to official security clearance and biometric data checking. One hundred and fifty of 400 refugees who had made it to Calais were reportedly told by British officials to go to Paris or Brussels to try for visas there. Ukrainians without families in Britain could only get in if they found someone to sponsor them. Details of what this means are still being “worked up at pace and will be communicated in due course”. We can only assume that Priti Patel’s officials are still operating under Theresa May’s “hostile environment” policy towards immigrants. She and they are oblivious of the crisis in common humanity now looming over Europe. A frostier welcome to Britain could hardly be imagined. There is no hint that Ukrainians should have unrestricted right of entry as they flee the Russian invasion, as elsewhere in Europe for the past horrific week. Johnson presumably believes it is not what the British public want. I can hear him saying, they voted for Brexit, didn’t they? It is hard not to see Johnson’s electoral calculus beneath all this. The obsession with halting migration has entered the Home Office soul, a department now institutionally xenophobic. The result is shameful. When today’s Britons are asked by their grandchildren what they did in the great Ukrainian war, they will have to reply that, thanks to Johnson, “at least we kept the foreigners out”.

3/8/2022,"While The Fiver hasn’t seen them, we’re ready to guess that the fabled “fan sentiment graphs” Manchester United’s media flunkies are tasked with compiling didn’t make for particularly pleasant viewing on Monday morning. Before Christmas, the club’s senior media wonk Phil Lynch found himself the subject of some ridicule for appearing on one of those new-fangled “podcast” things to explain just how much behind-the-scenes work goes into the composition of yet another pointless, unnecessary and poorly received Harry Maguire apology on assorted Social Media Disgraces. Almost 24 hours after Manchester United had their backsides spanked at Manchester City, Maguire has yet to pipe up on the state of affairs. Perhaps he and his teammates have risen up in rebellion against Lynch by changing their passwords, or the American has finally realised the utter futility of trying “to manage the social media [disgrace] narrative” of a club captain whose performance was so calamitous that City might have won by far less if he’d been shown the red card he deserved for a foul shortly after an hour. Which is not to pick on Maguire, even if it is like stealing the pennies from a dead man’s eyes these days. There was plenty of blame to go around for Manchester United’s defeat: questionable tactics by their interim manager, the excellence of their hosts and an air of second-half lethargy that even seemed to extend to the subs’ bench, unless Jesse Lingard and Marcus Rashford were specifically instructed not to make the rest of their teammates look worse by having anything resembling an impact when they came on. While the official United line was that Cristiano Ronaldo had sat this one out in Portugal with hip-knack, pre-match rumours suggested the preening show-pony might have stormed off to Portugal in a hissy-fit upon discovering he would not be playing in a starting line-up that boasted no out-and-out strikers. “There seems to be more to the Ronaldo story when a manager comes out and talks about a hip flexor,” tooted Roy Keane. “I don’t get it. We talk about Ronaldo being a machine and very rarely getting injured but every now and again he comes out with that … a hip flexor? It doesn’t add up to me.” If Ronaldo does have the hump, it seems he is not the only one. On Monday it emerged from the world’s leakiest dressing-room that Rashford is considering his future at United due to the lack of game-time he is getting under Ralf Rangnick. The Leader of the Opposition might not want to make too hasty a decision – with Rangnick, Ronaldo and possibly Edinson Cavani all likely to be out of the picture come summer, more opportunities should become available, even if United don’t have any games to play in Europe.

The Queen’s Celtic remain three points clear on top of the Scottish Premiership after a 3-1 win at Livingston. “We hunted in packs, we won the ball and we didn’t give them a moment’s rest,” roared Ange Postecoglou. After storming back to see off Chelsea and win the Continental League Cup, Manchester City manager Gareth Taylor reckons some of the team’s critics went a bit far earlier this season. “The players are the most important thing,” he sighed. “They’ve shown that they’re fighting, they’ve been fighting the whole season, and sometimes things haven’t gone our way.

3/8/2022,"The first major study to compare brain scans of people before and after they catch Covid has revealed shrinkage and tissue damage in regions linked to smell and mental capacities months after subjects tested positive. It comes as the largest study to date of the genetics of Covid-19 identified 16 new genetic variants associated with severe illness, and named a number of existing drugs that could be repurposed to prevent patients from getting severely ill, some of which are already in clinical trials. Together, these studies shed new light on the biological mechanisms that underpin the disease. In the brain study, researchers at the University of Oxford studied 785 people aged between 51 and 81 who had received brain scans before and during the pandemic as part of the UK Biobank study. More than half of them tested positive for Covid between the two scans. Compared with 384 uninfected control subjects, those who tested positive for Covid had greater overall brain shrinkage and more grey matter shrinkage, particularly in areas linked to smell. For example, those who had Covid lost an additional 1.8% of the parahippocampal gyrus, a key region for smell, and an additional 0.8% of the cerebellum, compared with control subjects. Disrupted signal processing in such areas may contribute to symptoms such as smell loss. Those who were infected also typically scored lower on a mental skills test than uninfected individuals. Lower scores were associated with a greater loss of brain tissue in the parts of the cerebellum involved in mental ability. The effects were more pronounced in older people and those hospitalised by the disease, but still evident in others whose infections were mild or asymptomatic, the research suggested, which was published in the journal Nature. Further scans are needed to determine whether these brain changes are permanent or partially reversible. “The brain is plastic, which means that it can re-organise and heal itself to some extent, even in older people,” said Prof Gwenaëlle Douaud at the University of Oxford. In separate research also published in Nature, researchers led by Dr Kenneth Baillie, a consultant in critical care medicine at the University of Edinburgh, sequenced the genomes of 7,491 Covid patients admitted to intensive care units in the UK. Researchers compared their DNA with that of 48,400 people who had not been infected, plus the DNA of a further 1,630 people who experienced mild Covid. The study identified 16 new genetic variants associated with admission to intensive care, including genes implicated in blood clotting, the immune system and the intensity of inflammation. It also confirmed the involvement of seven other genes that the team identified in earlier studies, and which contributed to the rheumatoid arthritis drug baricitinib being tested on Covid patients. Data published last week showed that it reduced the risk of death from severe Covid by about a fifth, demonstrating “proof of principle that we can find new treatments using genetics”, Baillie said. Among the new variants identified is a small change in GM-CSF, a protein that helps to activate immune cells in the lungs after infection. A drug targeting this gene, otilimab, is being tested in people with Covid. “To have a genetic signal close to this gene gives us more confidence that this is a valid target,” said Baillie. Others included variations in genes that control the levels of a central component of blood clotting – known as Factor VIII – which is disrupted in the most common type of the inherited bleeding disorder haemophilia. Abnormal clotting in response to Covid could result in reduced oxygen supply to critical organs, Baillie explained. “These results explain why some people develop life-threatening Covid-19, while others get no symptoms at all. But more importantly, this gives us a deep understanding of the process of disease and is a big step forward in finding more effective treatments,” he added. “It is now true to say that we understand the mechanisms of Covid better than the other syndromes we treat in intensive care in normal times – sepsis, flu, and other forms of critical illness. Covid-19 is showing us the way to tackle those problems in the future.”",News/World news,"Covid can shrink brain and damage its tissue, finds research",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/covid-can-shrink-brain-and-damage-its-tissue-finds-research
3/8/2022,"The Amazon is approaching a tipping point, data shows, after which the rainforest would be lost with “profound” implications for the global climate and biodiversity. Computer models have previously indicated a mass dieback of the Amazon is possible but the new analysis is based on real-world satellite observations over the past three decades. Novel statistical analysis shows that more than 75% of the untouched forest has lost stability since the early 2000s, meaning it takes longer to recover after droughts and wildfires. The greatest loss of stability is in areas closer to farms, roads and urban areas and in regions that are becoming drier, suggesting that forest destruction and global heating are the cause. These factors “may already have pushed the Amazon close to a critical threshold of rainforest dieback”, the scientists conclude. The study does not enable a prediction of when the tipping point could be reached. But the researchers warned that by the time the triggering of the tipping point could be detected, it would be too late to stop it. Once triggered, the rainforest would transform to grassland over a few decades at most, releasing huge amounts of carbon and accelerating global heating further. Tipping points on a planetary scale are among the greatest fears of climate scientists, as they are irreversible on human timescales. In 2021, the same statistical technique revealed warning signs of the collapse of the Gulf Stream and other key Atlantic currents, with “an almost complete loss of stability over the last century”. A shutdown of these currents would have catastrophic consequences around the world, disrupting monsoon rains and endangering Antarctic ice sheets. Another recent study showed that a significant part of the Greenland ice sheet is on the brink of a tipping point, which would lead to 7 metres of sea level rise over time. “Many researchers have theorised that an Amazon tipping point could be reached, but our study provides vital empirical evidence that we are approaching that threshold,” said Prof Niklas Boers, at the Technical University of Munich in Germany. “Seeing such a resilience loss in observations is worrying. The Amazon rainforest stores huge amounts of carbon that could be released in the case of even partial dieback.” The scientists said Amazon dieback had “profound implications at a global scale”. Boers added: “The Amazon is definitely one of the fastest of these tipping elements in the climate system.” The research, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, examined satellite data on the amount of vegetation in more than 6,000 grid cells across the untouched Amazon from 1991 to 2016. They found that in the past 20 years areas impacted by droughts or fires took significantly longer to recover than before. This is a key sign of increasing instability because it shows the processes of restoration are getting weaker. Drier areas of the forest lost more stability than wetter ones. “This is alarming, as the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] models project an overall drying of the Amazon region in response to global warming,” Boers said. Areas closer to human destruction of the forest also became more unstable. Trees are crucial in producing rain, so felling them to clear land for beef and soy production creates a vicious circle of drier conditions and more tree loss. Another study in 2021, based on data from hundreds of small plane flights, showed the Amazon now emits more carbon dioxide than it absorbs, mostly because of fires. But Boers said the data indicated that the tipping point has not yet been crossed: “So there’s hope.” Prof Tim Lenton at Exeter University in the UK, a co-author of the study, said: “It supports efforts to reverse deforestation and degradation of the Amazon to give it back some resilience against ongoing climate change.” Chris Jones, at the Met Office Hadley Centre in the UK, and not part of the study team, said: “This research adds compelling evidence that climate change is a risk now, and that these severe and irreversible impacts could become a reality. We have a narrow window of opportunity to take urgent action. “The worrying conclusion [of the study] fits with other recent research on increased tree mortality, increased fires, and reduced regional carbon sinks. The IPCC report out last week assessed that risks of large scale singular events, such as Amazon dieback, are now closer than ever.” Bernardo Flores, at the Federal University of Santa Catarina in Brazil, said: “The study shows that although the forest may seem fine, with its normal structure and biodiversity, internal processes are already changing, silently, reducing the system’s capacity to persist in the long run. The approach used is interesting because it reveals early warning signals of these changes.” Flores’s research revealed that savannas were expanding at the heart of the Amazon because of wildfires. The government of Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has been harshly criticised for encouraging more deforestation, which soared by 22% in the year to November, the highest level since 2006. Boers said: “It’s really complicated to say what’s going to be first: reaching a tipping point by [loss of stability] of the natural vegetation system, or just the bulldozers reaching the forest.”",News/Environment,"Climate crisis: Amazon rainforest tipping point is looming, data shows",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/07/climate-crisis-amazon-rainforest-tipping-point
3/8/2022,"Blending the grand visuals of a sweeping epic with the psychological unease of a chamber piece, Charlotte Sieling’s feature probes the legacy of Denmark’s Queen Margrete, a visionary ruler who brokered the historic Kalmar Union that – for the first time – united Norway, Sweden and Denmark against the threat of a German invasion. But her reign also saw a bizarre mystery in the Scandinavian region, which forms the emotional beating heart of this stately film. On the eve of the engagement between Margrete’s adopted son Erik (Morten Hee Andersen), and Princess Philippa (Diana Martinová), daughter of England’s Henry IV, news broke that the Queen’s biological son King Olaf (Jakob Oftebro) had returned from the dead. This sudden arrival not only unsettled political coalitions but also sent the usually stoic Margrete into a state of distress. Since she was not at his side when Olaf died, her maternal grief encouraged her to believe that Olaf had survived. On the other hand, her monarchical rationality questioned if he was merely an impostor sent to her doorsteps to disrupt a sought-after alliance with England. Much of this emotional tug-of-war is played out in atmospherically lit indoor compositions, which evoke a painterly, classical feel. What elevates the film from a run-of-the-mill period drama is Trine Dyrholm’s masterfully understated performance as the tormented queen. Her Margrete has no need to shout and weep to convey her turmoil; a mere gaze is enough to articulate the dilemma of having to put collective needs over personal desires. While the plot is at times overstuffed with palace intrigues, this piercing character study carries a contemporary poignancy, as it encapsulates the difficult choices a female leader has to make in a world bounded by patriarchal control.

3/8/2022,"Interviews to select the new chair of Ofcom are due to start next week after the government admitted it had finally “exhausted” the hunt for potential candidates, almost two years after the process began. The search to replace Terry Burns at the telecoms, media and postal regulator started in early 2020 when Lord Burns announced he was to stand down, and a successor was expected to be found by the end of that year, after the appointment of Melanie Dawes as Ofcom’s new chief executive. However, the process has been dogged by delays after Boris Johnson’s unsuccessful attempt to install Paul Dacre to push a more rightwing agenda at the body. The former editor of the Daily Mail unexpectedly failed the interview process the first time around. Ministers cleared the way for him to try again, only for Dacre to withdraw his application. The government had to abandon and restart the process, and the “partygate” investigator and Whitehall fixer Sue Gray was put in charge of the interview panel. On Monday Julian Knight, the chair of the digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) committee – who has called the process a “shambles” – said the government had refused to tell him how many applications had been received and how many candidates were being considered for the shortlist. “Another week, another new instalment of suspense in the ridiculous soap opera that is the race to become Ofcom’s new chair,” he said. “The committee is not after a behind-the-scenes commentary on the appointment process, but this latest cliffhanger from the DCMS department – which cannot or will not even tell us how many people have applied to audition for the starring role – does make you wonder whether we are heading for a happy ending.” In a letter of response, the permanent secretary at the DCMS, Sarah Healey, told Knight that the government did not want to “increase speculation on the process” and aimed to “minimise media speculation”. “We will not be providing a running commentary on candidate numbers,” she said, adding that this information would be made public as part of the successful candidate’s pre-appointment hearing. The government’s second run at appointing Dacre with a new-look interview panel came unstuck in December when he unexpectedly pulled out of the process, days later announcing he had taken a new role back at the publisher of the Daily Mail. In January the government reopened applications again for a week, closing on 2 February, and the former ITV, Channel 4 and BBC executive Michael Grade said he had thrown his “hat in the ring”. On Monday Healey claimed the reopening for one more round of applications was to make sure that all potential candidates had been given a chance to apply, given the Christmas break, and the recruitment advisers Saxton Bampfylde had “done all possible outreach”. “We are now confident that we have exhausted all possible opportunities to ensure the breadth and diversity of the candidate pool,” she said. “The campaign is progressing to interviews over the coming week. And we hope to be able to announce a preferred candidate in the near future.” Knight said: “Anyone who has been following this long drawn-out saga will know that feeling of exhaustion all too well.”",News/Media,Interviews for Ofcom chair due to begin as search is ‘exhausted’,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/07/interviews-for-ofcom-chair-due-to-begin-as-search-is-exhausted
