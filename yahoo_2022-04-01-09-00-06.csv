4/1/2022,"UPDATED 3/31, 6:08 p.m. ET: The high school runner who was punched doesn’t want to press charges, TMZ reports. A spokesperson for the Osceola County Sheriff’s Office told the outlet the the offending person also declined to press charges. See original story below. A high school track race turned violent this week after one student athlete caught up to another and sucker-punched him in the middle of an event. The footage began circulating online on Tuesday of the athlete running up behind the runner and punching him in the back of the head while onlookers sounded extremely upset. The race continued, however, as other kids ran around the one who was struck. According to TMZ, the incident occurred Saturday at the Tohopekaliga Tiger Invitational in Kissimmee, Florida. What apparently led up to the attack was the student in the black uniform standing on the track during the race. Witnesses at the meet told the outlet that he wouldn’t move when racers were taking their lap, and the runner in the red and white uniform bumped him to get out of the way. After that, the athlete in the black uniform waited for the other runner to take another lap before he ran behind him and punched him in the head. The footage sounds like the onlookers were preparing themselves for something to happen when they saw the kid in the black uniform begin to follow the runner in the red and white. Witnesses also say the police were called to the scene after the race, but no arrests were made. The runner who was punched reportedly got up eventually and finished the race.

4/1/2022,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner made a ""valuable"" appearance on Thursday before the U.S. House of Representatives committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, Representative Elaine Luria, a member of the panel, said. ""It was really valuable for us to have the opportunity to speak to him,"" Luria told MSNBC. The Democratic representative declined to provide specifics about Kushner's appearance before the panel via videolink, but said he commented on various reports about events of the day that have already been published. ""He was able to voluntarily provide information to us to verify, substantiate, provide his own take on this different reporting,"" she said. Kushner is the first close relative of the former president known to have spoken to the House Select Committee. He also served as a senior adviser in the Trump White House. A committee spokesman declined comment. The Select Committee has conducted hundreds of interviews in its investigation of the attack on the Capitol last year by supporters of Trump as lawmakers were poised to certify the Republican's defeat in the November 2020 presidential election by Democratic President Joe Biden.

4/1/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) - In the early morning of Feb. 15, 2019, armed police and intelligence agents burst into Timofey Zhukov's home in Surgut, an oil town in western Siberia. They knocked him to the floor, then began searching his belongings, he said. It was one of at least 20 raids across Surgut that day, Zhukov told Reuters. He said all of those targeted were Jehovah's Witnesses, an organisation that had been banned in Russia two years earlier after Russia's Supreme Court ruled it extremist. Russian authorities argued the organisation promotes its beliefs as superior to other faiths. Zhukov and his fellow believers were detained for questioning and accused of ""continuing the activities of an extremist organisation,"" a crime that could lead to imprisonment. Russian authorities didn't respond to questions from Reuters about the matter. Zhukov, who trained as a lawyer, told Reuters he and the others have done nothing unlawful. The Surgut branch of the Jehovah's Witnesses was liquidated after the ban came into force, Zhukov said, ""but we continue to believe, regardless of whether there is a legal entity."" Jarrod Lopes, a spokesperson for Jehovah's Witnesses, told Reuters, ""If Russia's skewed view of extremism was imposed on everyone, then just about every believer and non-believer would be banned in Russia, not just Jehovah's Witnesses."" Jehovah's Witnesses say they are politically neutral. They don't lobby or vote for political candidates or run for office. They don't sing national anthems or salute the flag of any nation because they view it as an act of worship. They also reject military service – a choice that has led to the imprisonment of Jehovah's Witnesses members in several countries. Religious life in Russia is dominated by the Orthodox Church, which is championed by President Vladimir Putin. Some Orthodox scholars view Jehovah's Witnesses as a ""totalitarian sect."" Zhukov's case is still working its way through the courts. But his name already appears on the register of ""terrorists and extremists"" and he can't travel outside the city without permission. He has only restricted access to his bank account. If he wants to withdraw more than 10,000 roubles ($120) in a single month he has to explain the reasons: ""I need to pay for the apartment, for kindergarten, for school."" Over the past three years, Zhukov said, police and investigators threatened him with jail and he was forcibly admitted to a hospital in Yekaterinburg, 1,000 km away, to undergo a psychiatric examination. He said he spent 14 days there alongside patients who included violent criminals. ""I passed all the tests, some involving devices on my head."" The list of ""terrorists and extremists"" has grown steadily. At the end of 2021, there were more than 12,200 individuals and groups on the register, up 13% from about a year earlier. Russia doesn't publish the dates on which names are added, but Reuters compared the current list with previous versions saved on archive.org, which stores web pages. Violent extremists such as neo-Nazi groups and Islamic State appear on the list. At least 400 local Jehovah's Witnesses groups are currently designated as extremist or terrorist, according to a Reuters analysis of the Russian list. In January, a 56-year-old female Jehovah's Witness was sentenced to six years in a penal colony for extremism. The following month, a 64-year-old man was handed a six-year sentence on the same charge. Both had insisted their innocence. Zhukov too insists that his religious beliefs do not contravene any law. ""As a lawyer, I can very easily distinguish between a religious association and a legal entity,"" he said. ""I can't explain why some lawyers and judges can't see the difference. And what threat do we pose?"" ""We preach, we tell people about the kingdom of God from the Bible.""

4/1/2022,"The owners of seven Little Caesars franchises in Tennessee have been accused by federal officials of violating child labor laws and underpaying their staff. Now they’re facing more than $162,000 in penalties. The U.S. Department of Labor levied the fines after investigators said the franchise owners allowed 15-year-old employees to use “hazardous” equipment and work long hours during the school week. Officials said the violations occurred at seven locations in Antioch, Columbia, Franklin and Nashville. “Child labor laws are intended to ensure young workers obtain valuable work experience safely without interfering with their safety and education,” said Juan Coria, regional administrator for the Wage and Hour Division in Atlanta. Officials identified the franchise owners as JJ Pizza Service LLC and S&S Pizza LLC, neither of which could be reached for comment. A Little Caesars spokesperson did not immediately respond to McClatchy News’ request for comment on March 31. According to the Labor Department, investigators noted the Little Caesars franchise owners didn’t account for all the hours their employees worked and failed to pay them minimum wage and overtime as a result. They recovered roughly $1,625 in back wages for 21 workers as a result. Investigators also saw 15-year-old employees “preparing food for baking, removing food from ovens and operating a vertical stand-up mixing machine” — activities labor officials consider to be “hazardous.” “In addition, the employers scheduled 15-year-old employees to work after 7 p.m. and more than 18 hours in a school week, as well as past 9 p.m. and more than 40 hours in a week when school was not in session — all violations of the federal child labor standards,” officials said. According to federal regulation, 14- and 15-year-olds can work “non-hazardous jobs” for a limited number of hours, namely: Three hours on a school day 18 hours in a school week Eight hours on a non-school day 40 hours in a non-school week Between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., except from June 1 to Labor Day, when those work hours are extended to 9 p.m. The Department of Labor issued a $161,050 civil penalty against the Little Caesars owners for the alleged child labor violations. In the last two years, officials said they have found child labor violations among more than 190 food service workers across the Southeast. Employers have had to pay more than $1 million in fines as a result.
