1/22/2022,"Brian Laundrie scrawled messages in a notebook admitting that he killed his girlfriend Gabby Petito, the FBI said in a statement Friday as they announced that their investigation into the couple’s deaths was now closed. The notebook was found alongside Laundrie’s remains in a wooded area in Florida in October, weeks after police say he killed Petito while they were traveling the country in a van. “The FBI’s primary focus throughout the investigation was to bring justice to Gabby and her family,” said FBI Denver Special Agent Michael Schneider. “The public’s role in helping us in this endeavor was invaluable as the investigation was covered in media around the world.” The influencer couple documented their “van life” trip in cheery posts on YouTube and Instagram. But, beneath the service, they’d had explosive arguments, including one that prompted witnesses to call police in Moab, Utah. Officer Who Stopped Gabby Petito and Brian Laundrie: ‘I’m Desperately Fucked Over That She Got Killed’ Petito’s parents reported her missing on Sept. 12 after Laundrie returned home alone to Florida and refused to tell anyone where Petito was. The FBI said text messages were sent between Laundrie and Petito’s phones after she was killed, indicating Laundrie tried to obstruct her death and act like she was alive. He also continued using Petito’s debit cards. As the case made headlines around the world, and police scoured the country for any sign of Petito, Laundrie vanished while purportedly going on a hike near his parents’ North Port home. Petito’s remains were found on Sept. 19 at a Wyoming campsite near the couple’s last known shared location, and a coroner determined she died of “blunt-force injuries to the head and neck, with manual strangulation.” The manhunt for Laundrie went on for weeks, with his parents joining in searches of the Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park, a park he frequented. Laundrie’s remains—along with the notebook, a backpack, and a revolver—were eventually found on Oct. 20 after his parents decided to search the park again with law enforcement. The area had been flooded during earlier searches, the FBI said. A medical examiner concluded in November that Laundrie died by suicide from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. #FBIDenver issues a final investigative update on the Gabrielle Petito Case. https://t.co/44SiImlo6C pic.twitter.com/IygdHuIWbv — FBI Denver (@FBIDenver) January 21, 2022 “On behalf of the FBI, I want to express my deepest appreciation to the public for the thousands of tips that were provided during the investigation, and to our local, state and federal law enforcement partners for their work throughout the investigation,” Schneider said in the statement.

1/22/2022,"When Rebel Wilson began her dramatic weight-loss journey two years ago, she did so because she knew that her ""emotional eating was unhealthy,"" she explained recently. She added: ""I did it for myself."" But as it turns out, Wilson, as a public figure, was not the only one affected by her bodily transformation, which brought out the ire and disappointment of many of her fans. @RebelWilson I kind of wish you didn’t lose all that weight. People think you need to be skinny to be successful. Society will change the narrative if celebrities don’t give in to it. Showing you’re happy in your skin while overweight is something we need to see more of. — Nichole Baird (@Nichole05829408) January 14, 2022 The Thicc Appreciation Delegation is sadden to announce the loss of another Thicc HOF. Rebel Wilson has joined Adele & Jennifer Hudson in the skinny camp. As always we thank her for her years of service & hope her change makes her happy. https://t.co/Mc1Yb5MD4j — I Will @ The Fuck Out Of You (@Tempiwmf) January 10, 2022 I pray Lizzo doesn’t jump on the whole “getting skinny after fame” trend. We lost Adele, Rebel Wilson, Meghan Trainer, and Melissa McCarthy. — Mallory Saladen (@MallorySaladen) January 1, 2022 The reaction to Wilson was similar, as the above tweets point out, as it was for other famous women — Adele, Jennifer Hudson, Melissa McCarthy among them — who rose to fame in bigger bodies only to shed pounds (or announce they were dieting, as Lizzo did) at the height of their careers. (Celebrity men who get thin, meanwhile, tend to get shrugs or high-fives.) In fact, for many who looked up to these stars for being comfortable in their skin — and for learning to love their own larger bodies as a result — watching them go on to shed weight can feel like the ultimate betrayal. NGL, Skinny Adele feels like a betrayal. — Thomas J. Henny (@yungpopovich) January 17, 2022 ""I can definitely relate to feeling betrayed when celebrities do that,"" Katelyn Baker, a psychologist and life coach specializing in women's self-esteem and eating disorders, and a social influencer known as ""that fat doctor,"" tells Yahoo Life, adding that it can also feel like ""a slap in the face."" ""My initial gut reaction is that it almost feels like a hero is no longer a hero,"" she says, ""and I think it's due to this idea of representation, and how powerful it can be."" Many studies have found that, for various minority populations, such representation — seeing one's self reflected back at them through pop culture and media — is a vital element to having a ""stronger sense of their identity and pride in that identity,"" because ""it's being shown as something that's OK,"" Baker says.    A post shared by Rebel Wilson (@rebelwilson) Virgie Tovar, body-positive influencer, activist and author of books including The Self-Love Revolution: Radical Body Positivity for Girls of Color, also understands the power of such representation. ""When you're in a larger body and you're hearing for the first time that there's nothing wrong with you, that you aren't inherently unhealthy, that your body is beautiful, you really, really want to believe it,"" she tells Yahoo Life. ""This idea is so radical and so nascent, however, that the instinct is to look for evidence of others adopting this belief. This is where larger-bodied celebrities come in."" They become the ""evidence"" so many people are ""craving,"" Tovar says. ""They become our heroes, our models and our mentors because most of us need heroes and models and mentors when we are doing something scary and big and vulnerable and counter-cultural."" Then, she explains, ""When we experience a moment where someone fat shames us, we may call to mind that plus-size celebrity to give us a little strength and a little moxie. When we have a moment where someone doesn't want to date us because we're fat, we may put on that one song by a plus-size artist that turns our tears into a battle-cry that helps us move on.""    A post shared by Adele (@adele) But then, Tovar says, ""When that person who has been a hero or mentor ends up losing weight it can feel like a deep loss. More than that, it might feel like a betrayal."" Adele provided that battle cry for Baker, who says she was an ardent supporter from the very start of her career. ""I think there are a lot of people similar to me who became hardcore fans because she did represent us — and part of who she is in her fame … is because the body-positive community was instrumental in her getting to where she is."" That's why it felt ""a little harmful"" when the pop star spoke harshly about pushback to her weight-loss in her recent interview with Oprah — whose own journey with weight has both captivated and infuriated fans for decades now. Adele addressed the pushback during the sit-down, telling her, ""I was body-positive then and I'm body-positive now. It's not my job to validate how people feel about their bodies."" She added, ""I feel bad that it's made anyone feel horrible about themselves — but that's not my job. I'm trying to sort my own life out. I can't add another worry."" Regarding the comments, Baker explains, ""I am happy for her if she is happy and living her best life … but she maybe could've been handled it a bit more gently just because of what her size meant to [so many people] — as unrelated to her as that actually is."" Similarly, she remembers when many of her followers were upset about Lizzo announcing she was trying a smoothie diet, and says she fully understands the pushback over Wilson — ""especially because her most well-known role is 'Fat Amy,' which, despite much of the humor being ""derogatory,"" was ""a phenomenon"" of mainstream representation. ""I was like, 'I love her. She looks like me,'"" Baker recalls. Now, she says, ""It hurts."" As for feelings of anger that tend to surface, Tovar believes it could be ""when there's a sense that a celebrity rose to prominence or benefited professionally in some way through invoking body-positive or fat-positive ideology or aesthetics,"" adding, ""I think anger might come up if someone feels they've experienced what might be called fat-baiting,"" or using fat imagery or body-positivity speak as a marketing tactic that turns out to be hollow. Says Tovar, ""I think there is a fatphobic belief that no fat person would choose to be fat if they had the so-called 'right' amount of resources. So, when plus-size celebrities reach a certain level of fame and begin to lose weight, it can confirm for some people that this harmful belief is actually true."" She stresses that plus-size people are ""acutely stigmatized"" in aspects of society from healthcare to fashion, and that weight discrimination is legal in 49 of 50 states, so ""the intensity of the reaction to celebrity weight shifts is truly a product of that."" And only when mindsets change, Tovar believes, will we ""begin to see a shift away from relying so much on celebrities for our sense of well-being and rightness as fat people.""

1/22/2022,"Kat Von D is being sued by the former manager of her High Voltage Tattoo shop. Stephanie Davidson alleges that Von D fired her after she raised concerns about COVID-19 at work. She also claims Von D mocked safety precautions and failed to pay her properly. Kat Von D is being sued by a former employee who claims she was wrongfully terminated after voicing concerns about COVID-19 at work. Stephanie Davidson worked as a manager of Von D's High Voltage Tattoo studio in California between 2017 and 2020, according to a complaint filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court this month. The complaint says the studio was required to shut down at the start of the pandemic, and began reopening around June 2020. It was then that Davidson was let go, the complaint says. She's now seeking unspecified damages, and alleges that she faced retaliation, discrimination in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act, unlawful business practices, and wrongful termination, among other issues, while working under the celebrity tattoo artist. She also claims in the complaint that Von D failed to pay her an hourly minimum wage or base salary — instead providing her with a ""ten percent share of every tattoo paid for each day, which on some days was $0."" Attorneys for Davidson told Insider that they filed the lawsuit to hold Von D ""accountable for her unlawful behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic."" Representatives for Von D did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.   During the government-mandated shutdown of business in March 2020, the High Voltage founder and her employees — including Davidson — chatted in a group text message, according to the complaint. It was there that Von D often ""questioned whether the pandemic was real,"" the complaint states. Later on April 28, 2020, California Governor Gavin Newsom announced a phased reopening plan — which, at the time, did not include tattoo shops as they were considered high-risk. According to the complaint, however, Davidson — who says she has Type 1 diabetes — was expected ""to work illegally in violation of the Stay at Home orders"" while the business was operating at some capacity during the mandated lockdown period. Von D planned to ""open privately"" and cover the front entrance of the shop so that the public couldn't see inside, according to the complaint. She planned to do so until California's ""idiot governor lifts this ridiculous lock down,"" she said in a text to Davidson and another employee, the complaint says. ""Today the barber shop is open for business and I don't understand why we are unable to open,"" Von D added in the text cited in the complaint, seemingly referencing Trendsetters Barbershop, an adjacent business. ""So I cannot stand by and let high voltage die, and need to get back to work even if it's just for appointments for the time being."" It was then that Davidson ""inquired about safety protocols at the shop"" before returning to her work. Her concerns were ""dismissed,"" according to the complaint, with Von D stating in text messages: ""please know that I will not be wearing masks and refuse to do so."" Later in June when the shop was legally allowed to reopen to the public, Von D reiterated her stance on masks, contact tracing, temperature checks, and other COVID safety protocols, according to the complaint, and argued that masks could ""restrict"" oxygen and cause customers to pass out. (Doctors have debunked such claims, however, and said wearing them does not affect oxygen levels.) Those who weren't comfortable returning to the shop were instructed to no longer work for Von D, according to the complaint, while those who remained and took precautions faced ""disparaging remarks."" ""You're going to wear a maxi pad on your face?"" Von D said to one employee who wore a mask, according to the complaint. She also criticized another employee by saying they lived in ""a state of fear based on mainstream media narrative,"" the complaint says. After June 19 — when the complaint says High Voltage Tattoo legally reopened without safety protocols in place — Davidson took her concerns to the Governor's Office and Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. Two weeks after doing so, according to the complaint, she was informed that her job had been given to another person. ""While she has attempted to obtain employment, she has been unable to find consistent employment since then and continues to suffer lost income,"" the complaint says of Davidson. ""She also suffered and continues to suffer ongoing emotional distress as a result of her termination."" Davidson's attorneys told Insider that Von D ""puts profits and publicity over the health of her employees and the safety of her customers."" ""She intentionally and unlawfully ignored state laws and regulations created to protect both workers and the public,"" they said. ""No matter what any business owner's beliefs may be, you cannot ignore the law and force employees to choose between risking their health or keeping their job. When you do, there are consequences. She will be held accountable for her malicious actions.""

1/22/2022,"Noah Golden opened an account at Chase bank in 2017 for his then-6-year-old daughter. The idea was to gradually deposit funds and then present her with the windfall when she turns 18. Golden, 41, seldom monitored the account. Year after year, he just kept putting cash into it. It wasn't until recently the Woodland Hills resident discovered that, on dozens of occasions, someone else — not his daughter — was taking money out. This is one of numerous horror stories I received in response to last week's column on Chase's failure to prevent an 81-year-old customer from wiring more than $600,000 to an overseas scammer. In that case, Chase says it followed all its security protocols, including asking the woman if she was sure she wanted to make the transactions. (The bank didn't know the scammer was listening in the whole time via the woman's cellphone.) A number of readers shared similar experiences involving elderly loved ones and banks that didn't seem interested in going the extra mile to protect customers from fraud. Some of these incidents involved Chase, some involved other big banks. Golden's story jumped out because it involved a child and because it's a pretty stunning example of a bank placing short-term financial interest ahead of long-term customer loyalty. In response to Chase's refusal to restore even a portion of his daughter's money, Golden said he closed his five Chase accounts and moved about $160,000 in assets to another bank. ""I was amazed,"" he told me. ""They showed no remorse whatsoever. I even placed my daughter on the phone with them. They told her they couldn't help."" Chase says it can't confirm that a bank worker spoke with the girl. But Golden's daughter, now 11, told me the exchange did occur. ""I said I was very sad that they couldn't do anything,"" the sixth-grader recalled. ""They said it was my problem, not theirs. I was crying."" The classic stereotype of bankers is that they're hardhearted. Think Mr. Potter from ""It's a Wonderful Life."" But what kind of bank worker reduces a young girl to tears and isn't sufficiently moved to try to restore at least some of the missing funds? Golden said he discovered the fraudulent transactions last month while doing routine year-end financial housekeeping. Between January and November of last year, he said, someone made about 30 separate withdrawals from his daughter's account. It typically happened one day each month, with two or three withdrawals made on each occasion. Most were for small amounts, $20 here, $30 there. The largest single-day hit was for $360. ""I think they were doing these minuscule amounts to avoid drawing attention and to keep the account active,"" Golden said. In total, the fraudster drained about $1,200 from the Chase account and transferred all the money to a PayPal account. Golden said PayPal confirmed having received the funds but said there was nothing more it could do without a court order. ""If it was my money, OK,"" he said. ""But for an 11-year-old girl, this should never happen."" Golden laid out the problem for Chase and was told the bank would investigate. It didn't take long for Chase to conclude that, as it apparently told the little girl, this wasn't the bank's problem. That's because of a rule that all suspicious activity must be reported within 60 days of the transaction, it said. Golden replied that he wasn't aware of any such rule. It's in the contract, Chase countered. It is. On page 13 of Chase's 25-page deposit account agreement, I found this: ""If your statement shows electronic funds transfers that you did not make, tell us right away. If you do not tell us within 60 days after the statement was sent or otherwise made available to you, you may not get back any money you lost after the 60 days if we can prove that we could have prevented the transactions if you had told us in time."" So let's be clear: Chase did nothing wrong. It set rules for situations like this and it followed them. In fact, Golden said the bank refunded $20 withdrawn by the fraudster on Jan. 1 of this year, after he lodged his complaint. Even so, there's following rules and then there's doing right by a long-term customer. Golden said he's been banking with Chase for 15 years. As noted above, he had five accounts at the bank containing roughly $160,000. Does any business really want to jeopardize such a relationship? There's absolutely no room for compromise, especially considering the circumstances? A day after I contacted Chase this week, Golden said he received a call from the bank saying it was reopening the investigation it had closed. Chase told me Thursday afternoon it's now partially reimbursing Golden for the missing funds. ""This is an unfortunate situation,"" a bank spokesperson said by email. ""However, protecting a customer’s account must be a partnership between the bank and the customer. ""We monitor accounts continually and need customers to do the same, especially with accounts for minors. The sooner the customer contacts us to report suspicious activity on an account, the sooner we can help. Unfortunately, reporting fraud 10 months later doesn't help stop it."" He's right. For consumers, a key takeaway here is to be diligent in overseeing your financial accounts. More often than not, if you don't spot a questionable transaction, no one will. And then it may be too late to fix things. Also, and I know this is asking a lot, read the contracts. Many of us might reasonably conclude that it's unfair to bury important terms deep within a 25-page document. But that's how the game's played. As long as a business discloses its rules, it's largely off the hook when the you-know-what hits the fan. Buyer beware and all that. That said, Chase bank's corporate parent, JPMorgan Chase, earned $11.7 billion in profit in the third quarter of last year. And these guys really wanted to play hardball with an 11-year-old girl? I asked Golden's daughter if there was a chance she'd be a Chase customer when she grows up. ""No,"" she answered without hesitation. That's the sort of thing all businesses should take note of. People remember the companies that treated them well. And they remember the ones that didn't. This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",Business/LA Times,"Column: Here's what happened after $1,200 was drained from an 11-year-old's bank account",https://news.yahoo.com/column-heres-happened-1-200-140052542.html
1/22/2022,"OPINION: A group of researchers, doctors and medical experts expressed concerns about the Spotify podcaster’s willingness to spread COVID misinformation. But no one cared when people raised those red flags about Rogan’s willingness to spread white supremacy. If you’re reading this piece (and you are reading it, I can tell), you should understand what this piece will not be. You are not about to read about how Joe Rogan is racist. You aren’t going to read how Rogan isn’t funny or even deserving of being considered the most influential podcaster of all time. However, I cannot, in good conscience, declare that I am unbiased when it comes to Spotify’s $100 million white man because of one fact: I like Joe Rogan. Perhaps “like” is too austere a word. I’ve paid to see him perform live. I have listened to hundreds of episodes of The Joe Rogan Experience and that number may well reach four digits if you include podcasters in the Rogan comedy universe such as Ari Shaffir, Tom Segura and Joey Diaz. I’ve heard Rogan speak about growing up in liberal San Francisco, living in Florida and spending his teenage years near Boston, which seems to have created a diverse set of interests, from mixed martial arts to Egyptology to dick jokes. My unvarnished opinion of Rogan is that he seems to be extremely interested in things and not just on a facile level. To be fair, I haven’t really listened to his podcast since he became exclusive to Spotify. Still, there is no question that he created the most powerful platform in podcasting and may very well be the most powerful person in all of media. His estimated audience nearly triples Tucker Carlson’s, dwarfs all three networks’ late-night talk shows combined and, when Rogan’s YouTube views are included, his audience rivals The Oprah Winfrey Show at the height of its popularity. Plus, Rogan has cultivated a legion of young, mostly white, mostly male fans who have exalted him to a level that ranks somewhere between a guru and a renaissance man. Rogan’s status as a counterculture icon of libertarian white boys who wear Ed Hardy shirts to jujitsu practice is why last week a “coalition of scientists, medical professionals, professors, and science communicators spanning a wide range of fields such as microbiology, immunology, epidemiology, and neuroscience” wrote an open letter to Spotify about Rogan’s “concerning history of broadcasting misinformation, particularly regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.” The letter didn’t ask Spotify to censor or ban Rogan. Instead, they wanted to express their concern over Spotify’s “failure to mitigate the damage it is causing.” But even before he became the official COVID consultant to NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers and other prominent celebrities who weren’t worried about the coronavirus until they tested positive for the coronavirus, Rogan wasn’t shy about sharing his belief that young, healthy people like himself didn’t have anything to worry about when it came to COVID. Even though most people aren’t as healthy as Rogan, according to the data, he was statistically correct. More than 80 percent of the people who died from COVID were over 65, and many more had comorbidities. Then again, only 10 to 20 percent of smokers get lung cancer and most people survive gunshot wounds to the chest. But there’s a reason Rogan is so fearless about saying what doctors around the world will never tell you: Joe Rogan is not a doctor. In fact, Rogan has the same medical expertise as a monkey or a man who makes a living describing face kicks. Because Rogan’s job is to say things and a doctor’s primary role is to make sure each one of their patients doesn’t die, very few physicians would advise their patients to puff Newports while taking a slug to the torso. That’s why we rarely hear actual doctors say: “In my medical opinion, you’ll prolly be aight.” Then Rogan got the ‘rona. After he apparently cured himself with ivermectin, monoclonal antibodies and advanced medical care not available to people who don’t have the resources to move halfway across the country when they want “a little bit more freedom,” the comedian and UFC commentator would never be the same. He ranted about how ivermectin was not horse paste, blasted CNN and responded to public criticism by inviting COVID quacks on his show, most notably with Dr. Robert Malone, a scientist who has been banned from Twitter for spreading debunked medical misinformation during a global pandemic. During the Dec. 31 episode of Rogan’s show, Malone attributed the public’s acceptance of the world medical community’s consensus opinion to the debunked theory of “mass formation hypnosis.” Two weeks later, Rogan’s audience watched him chuck his usual evidence-based open-mindedness into the wind when his argument that COVID was worse than the vaccine was upended by peer-reviewed research in real time. Even as he read the words written by people who know stuff, Rogan could not accept the objective facts, much to the lament of some of his actual fans who clearly saw the cognitive dissonance. Having watched Joe Rogan quite a bit, he’s usually very open minded about topics and has only really acted like this about covid. He just won’t budge. It’s kinda sad to see but hey it’s a once in a lifetime thing, everyone’s got stuff they’re adamant about. He’s still a good guy — AtaCz (@hockey_habs) January 13, 2022 For almost any other podcaster in America, this pattern of white wackadoodle doo would be laughable, but COVID broke Rogan. Part of his thing was that he was always open-minded, unbiased and would often verify the most innocuous fact. I’ve heard him dismantle the argument that the moon landing was fake, that vegans are healthier and that monkeys eating psychedelic mushrooms are what made the human brain evolve (Luckily, another Rogan guest explained that mushrooms clearly came from aliens). “By allowing the propagation of false and societally harmful assertions, Spotify is enabling its hosted media to damage public trust in scientific research and sow doubt in the credibility of data-driven guidance offered by medical professionals,” read the letter. “Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Rogan has repeatedly spread misleading and false claims on his podcast, provoking distrust in science and medicine. He has discouraged vaccination in young people and children, incorrectly claimed that mRNA vaccines are “gene therapy,” promoted off-label use of ivermectin to treat COVID-19 (contrary to FDA warnings), and spread a number of unsubstantiated conspiracy theories. “Mass-misinformation events of this scale have extraordinarily dangerous ramifications,” the letter continued. “This is not only a scientific or medical concern; it is a sociological issue of devastating proportions and Spotify is responsible for allowing this activity to thrive on its platform.” When the physicians noted how they “bear the arduous weight of a pandemic that has stretched our medical systems to their limits,” in the letter, I knew exactly how they felt. When the researchers spelled out how they “face backlash and resistance,” a lot of Black people knew exactly how the experts felt because many of us have pointed out this problem for years. I do not believe Joe Rogan is a white supremacist. However, along with an interest in psychedelic drugs, recreational choking and chimpanzees, Rogan has always held a fascination with white supremacists. Long before a makeshift militia was indicted for attempting a coup on the American legislature, Rogan hosted a sit-down with Gavin McInnes, founder of a then-unknown group called the Proud Boys. He has welcomed people who dabble around the periphery of the alt-right, such as Peter Boghossian, who was one of the founders of the “grievance studies” hoax that evolved into the demonization of critical race theory. Right-wing troll Chuck C. Johnson has made it to the JRE along with Jordan Peterson who The Guardian notes, “attracts a heterogeneous audience that includes Christian conservatives, atheist libertarians, centrist pundits and neo-Nazis.” Rogan has also entertained the musings of far-right provocateurs like Milo Yiannopoulos and Stefan Molyneux, two of the handful of JRE guests who promote the long-debunked “race science” belief that people of African descent have lower IQs. In all fairness, most episodes of The Joe Rogan Experience are not a three-hour discourse on the intellectual and social inferiority of people who don’t listen to Joe Rogan. Rogan sometimes openly disagrees with his guests and often pushes back against many of their ideologies. He believes that thoughts shouldn’t be censored, which is a valid point. But Rogan isn’t having a conversation with these guests in his living room over a joint and a cup of Bulletproof coffee; he’s asking them to speak into a microphone and talk, unfiltered, to tens of millions of people, many of whom are probably dumber than Rogan. And, while I don’t consider Rogan to be especially intelligent, he is probably more open-minded, more progressive and more informed than many of his listeners. Yet, his congenial, constantly curious personality sometimes makes it seem as if he agrees with what his guests are saying. Moreover, in many cases, Rogan is just not intellectually equipped to challenge many of his guests’ ideas—especially ones that have formed debunked ideas based on faulty research, personal prejudice and anecdotal evidence. For instance, before he migrated to Spotify, Rogan was obsessed with the lawsuit accusing Harvard of discriminating against Asian-American descent. He repeatedly asserted that, by denying students who tested higher on standardized tests, the Ivy League institution’s admissions policy was “racist,” which was a good point… But Rogan never mentioned the fact that research shows “wealthy students enjoy significant advantages throughout the college application process, and that income greatly impacts a student’s performance on standardized tests.” Rogan probably didn’t know that Asian Americans have the highest income in America. He didn’t acknowledge that most Black students attend underfunded, high-poverty schools that don’t have the same academic resources and curriculums. He didn’t consider the fact that standardized tests don’t accurately measure college success. He never spoke about the right of private institutions to curate a diverse academic environment because it more accurately reflects the real world. He never even quantified what he meant by “best students.” Rogan never even mentioned that the people who overcome disparities might be better students than those who graduate from the best schools, have the best test preparation money can afford and have been guided by people who know how to get into Ivy League schools. More importantly, he never considered that these disparities prove that white supremacy exists. However, there is a good reason for this: Joe Rogan didn’t know what he was talking about. He was just saying things. Into a microphone. To millions of people. Because he can. Because that’s what white boys get to do. As with COVID, Rogan and his minion of bearded free-thinkers who used-to-be-libertarian will never be substantially affected by the deadly virus of white supremacy. It is disingenuous at best and outright stupid at worst for someone as famous as Rogan to pretend that he is allowing his listeners to explore ideas without acknowledging the actions these positions can inspire and the harm these racist concepts cause in real life. Although Rogan may feel like the prototypical everyman, his guests know that millions of people are listening. Even if 1 percent of Rogan’s listeners are radicalized by a JRE guest, it means hundreds of thousands of people have been converted to a baseless philosophy thanks to Rogan’s pulpit. It might be interesting for him to sit down with author Abigail Shrier to discuss The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters because Rogan or his children probably won’t be murdered by a transphobic bigot. It’s probably interesting to debate if white people are genetically more intelligent than sub-Saharan Africans because he doesn’t have to wonder if his kid’s teacher or his cousin’s employer saw that Rogan clip and reached a different conclusion. Far too many times, white boys will say something idiotic or harmful and wipe away the prospect of being held accountable by saying: “I’m just asking questions!” It’s a neat trick, really. It’s as if the entire universe is an Etch A Sketch for white boys to shake and erase the consequences of their actions. What could possibly be wrong with asking questions? White boys are free to poke, prod and play around with the poisonous snake of white supremacy because they are born with natural immunity to its venom. They can publicly ruminate about how disenfranchised people should combat voter suppression with “personal responsibility.” They can sit on a Supreme Court and decide what women should do with their vaginas because they will never be forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy to full term. They can explain why Black people should just comply with police officers instead of running away because they have never been paralyzed by the fear of living in a country where they are hunted by people armed with guns and the authority of a legal system. Perhaps the greatest example of this is Rogan’s fascination with tossing around the n-word as if it were a lit firecracker and not a piece of dynamite. For Rogan, it is not a piece of dynamite. It does not conjure up the memories of his grandparents with nooses around their necks or the wealth stolen from everyone who will ever be in his family or the non-memories of cousins whose existences were snuffed out before they began. Watch him giggle while kicking the history of a people’s pain around as if it is a game of cornhole or a theoretical hackysack. And no, Joe Rogan is not a white supremacist. Rogan is just a man who built a soapbox on which he allows white supremacists to stand. Of course, some people will claim that holding Rogan accountable for the stage he built is “cancel culture.” But do not weep, my child; if there’s anyone who can’t be canceled, it’s Joe Rogan and white boys like him. If all else fails, he’ll be forced to earn millions of dollars performing comedy around the country while hosting his podcast on his own, where his pre–Spotify audience was even larger. White boys will never lose their freedom to speak, even if they claim they are just asking questions and exposing ideas to the public. “Public opinion is a sort of atmosphere, fresh, keen and full of sunlight…and this sunlight kills many of those noxious germs,” wrote Supreme Court justice and free speech advocate Louis Brandeis. “Selfishness, injustice, cruelty, tricks and jobs of all sorts shun the light; to expose them is to defeat them.” Brandeis—a “militant crusader for social justice”—wrote volumes of fearless opinions on every social, political and economic issue—except for one. Whenever a case involved Black people, Brandeis would become curiously silent. In 23 years on the Supreme Court, he did not write a single opinion on the “race question.” Louis Brandeis was not a white supremacist. Just because he repeatedly voted in support of segregation, voted in favor of the Klan and helped elect a white supremacist president doesn’t mean Brandeis was wrong. Speech should be free, sunlight is the best disinfectant for toxic ideas and Joe Rogan is a bright and shining star. But Joe Rogan is not the sun. Of course, I could be biased. Remember, I like Joe Rogan. Michael Harriot is a writer, cultural critic and championship-level Spades player.

1/22/2022,"The January 6 committee has obtained a document from the Trump White House titled ""Remarks on National Healing,"" per Politico. The document was drafted for delivery a day after the Capitol riot. Trump gave nearly identical remarks in a video posted on Twitter that day. A line in the document that Trump didn't say in his Twitter video is: ""The election fight is over."" The House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol riot has obtained a document from former President Donald Trump's White House titled ""Remarks on National Healing,"" according to a Politico report published on Friday. The document is part of a slew of executive branch records that Trump's legal team tried to block the committee from getting access to, per Politico. The Supreme Court on Wednesday denied Trump's request to block the release of some of his presidential records, clearing the way for the committee to obtain them. The document contains remarks that appear to have been scheduled for delivery a day after the Capitol riot. It's unclear who wrote the document, per Politico. On that day, January 7, 2021, Trump released a video on Twitter, in which he gave remarks that are nearly identical to those in the document. ""Like all Americans, I am outraged by the violence, lawlessness, and mayhem,"" Trump said in a video posted to Twitter, which has since been taken down as the social media platform permanently suspended his account in the wake of the riot. In the document, the remarks say: ""Like all Americans, I was outraged and sickened by the violence, lawlessness and mayhem."" However, one line in the document that was not uttered by Trump in his Twitter video is: ""The election fight is over."" ""But as for THIS election, Congress has now certified the results,"" the document reads, according to Politico. ""The election fight is over. A new administration will be inaugurated on January 20 th. My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power. This moment calls for healing and reconciliation."" What Trump did say was: ""Now Congress has certified the results. A new administration will be inaugurated on January 20th. My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power. This moment calls for healing and reconciliation."" A spokesperson for Trump's office did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. Since leaving office, Trump has continued to push the debunked claim that the 2020 election was rigged and maligned by widespread voter fraud.

1/22/2022,"According to a recent court filing by the New York attorney general, Donald Trump’s business empire may be in serious peril. Of course, we have seen this movie before – Trump faces seemingly insurmountable legal challenges, only to emerge unscathed. From Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian election interference to the impeachment trial for Trump’s role in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, and countless episodes in between, Trump seems to always avoid legal accountability. But the investigation underway by New York Attorney General Letitia James has the potential to hit Trump where it may matter most to him – his wallet. The AG’s investigation is civil in nature, meaning that no prison time is possible, but enormous amounts of money are at stake. If successful, a civil action for fraud under New York law could expose Trump to millions of dollars in damages and restitution and even dissolution of his business. In fact, it was a civil investigation by James’s predecessor that led to the 2018 dissolution of the Trump Foundation, billed as the charitable arm of the Trump Organization, based on a “shocking pattern of illegality.” Opinions in your inbox: Get a digest of our takes on current events every day And if fraudulent conduct is laid bare in a civil action, criminal investigators may make use of it in the parallel criminal probe that is underway in the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office. This week, James filed a petition with a New York state supreme court to compel compliance with subpoenas she has issued for the testimony of the former president, Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump. All three had authority over various financial statements regarding the valuation of assets for the Trump Organization. James argues that she needs evidence from these three witnesses to determine whether “numerous misstatements and omissions” made in the valuation of assets was done with the intent to defraud. Rather than comply with the subpoenas, Trump has asked the court to quash them. He has also filed a lawsuit asking a federal court in Albany to halt the investigation in its entirety, arguing that it has been brought solely for political purposes. But an argument that an investigation is meritless invites a rebuttal, which is exactly what James filed on Tuesday. In her petition, James detailed a number of her findings to date, such as the apparent over-valuing at least six assets for the purposes of loan applications, insurance coverage and tax deductions. James alleged that the Trump Organization reported on financial statements in 2014 that its golf property in Scotland was worth $435 million, double its documented valuation in 2013. Barbara McQuade: Two new reasons Trump should worry about the New York legal investigations. A lot. James also cited the increase in value of Trump’s Seven Springs Estate in Westchester County from $7.5 million in 1995 to $291 million in 2014. An appraisal in 2006 valued the property at $30 million. The petition further alleged that Trump has reported the size of his Manhattan apartment as 30,000 square feet when, in fact, it is slightly more than 10,000 square feet. The petition includes additional examples of potential fraud. New York law authorizes the state’s attorney general to investigate “persistent fraud or illegality” in conducting business, and to apply to a court for an order to enjoin that activity, permitting restitution, damages and cancellation of the certificate for doing business. The law further permits the attorney general to issue subpoenas to determine relevant facts as needed for her investigation. Here, James argues that she needs the testimony of the three Trumps. In any fraud case, the easy part is proving what happened. We know that the Trump Organization represented numbers on certain documents that appear to be inconsistent with numbers on other documents. The difficult part is proving why the numbers are different. Was it a simple mistake? Was it an accounting issue? Fraudulent intent is often best discerned by talking to the people who authorized the numbers. Trump has raised several reasons that the civil case should be stopped. One is that James is simply doing an end-run around the Trumps’ constitutional rights by using a civil action to elicit criminal admissions. But even at a civil deposition, witnesses may still assert their Fifth Amendment privileges against self-incrimination if their statements could potentially be used against them in a criminal case. According to James’s filing, Eric Trump did just that, invoking the Fifth Amendment an astonishing 500 times during his October deposition. USA TODAY's Carli Pierson: Sorry progressives, but Biden isn't doing that bad. Remember Trump? Another possible argument is that the entities that lent him money or provided insurance coverage are sophisticated financial companies that were required to do their own due diligence in making financial decisions. In other words, they should have known better than to trust him. This argument will fail. It is the intent of the offender, not the victim, that matters in a fraud case. And finally, Trump has used his favorite defense, that he is the real victim here, and that this investigation is a political witch hunt. Here, James has not helped her cause by making public statements about her efforts to take legal action against Trump, but inappropriate remarks by the attorney general does not negate fraudulent conduct. If James ultimately files a civil action for fraud, then it will be a court, and not James, that will decide whether the evidence is sufficient to award damages, restitution or dissolution. We still may see Trump pull off a daring rescue of his troubled company. Or maybe this time, the movie will have a happy ending.
