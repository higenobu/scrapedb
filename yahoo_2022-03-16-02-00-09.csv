3/16/2022,"Police video shows Arizona officers surrounding a Black man at a credit union after being erroneously told he was attempting to get money from the financial institution with a fraudulent check. The manager called the police before fully verifying the check with the person that wrote it. According to 12 News, the incident happened in October 2021, after Almond Brewer’s check for $3,200 was not clearly authenticated at the Pinal County Federal Credit Union in Apache Junction. When the check did not read in the system, the branch manager called the police, believing the young man was scamming. Although the manager reported the check was fake, that was never the case. When the check was run through a third-party vendor to be authenticated, it came back “inconclusive.” The company was not able to say whether it was real or fake. That nuanced detail was never given to the police when they were called to the credit union and arrived ready to detain a man they thought was involved in criminal activity. Police bodycam video shows some of the exchanges between Apache Junction police officers and the bank client, with Brewer saying, “Wow. This blows my mind.” Brewer, who believes he was racially profiled, said that he got the check from a woman he sold his boat to on Facebook Marketplace. He tried to cash it at his personal bank but was told it would be faster to cash it at the credit union — since the check appeared to be issued from that institution. Once Brewer gave the check to the manager and shared the instructions he was given, the manager allegedly looked at him oddly before calling the police. She asked him, “What was the check for?” He answered, “It was for one of my assets. I buy and sell boats, and I sold them off.” Brewer continued, saying, “She kinda looked surprised.” The check apparently had “red flags” that made the manager suspicious, including an old logo of the credit union, as the wrong routing and checking account number that did not line up with the member’s information. The manager’s call was released, and he is heard saying, “We have someone trying to cash a fake check with us. Yes, it’s a fake personal check.” The dispatcher asked, “What does he look like?” “Um … He’s African-American,” he said. The credit union says if the third-party verification party is unable to authenticate a check the employee should have first reached out to the account holder for verification. This was a process not followed until after 911 set off alarms. Once the manager reached the account holder, the check was verified, and Brewer should have been let go. Bodycam shows the officers were not made aware of this update until about 10 minutes into their detainment of Brewer. Before becoming aware, Brewer tried to state his case saying, “How can it be fraud, when she wrote it, signed it and she’s a member of this bank?” However, with the ordeal happening in public, Brewer says he was embarrassed by the incident and believes that it was racially motivated. “It was just, ‘Oh, you know, Black guy, locs in his hair, tattoos, came on a Harley, you know, let’s assume the worst,’” Brewer said. “Why embarrass somebody like that? Why, you know, make them feel less than a man.” An expert in bank services, Matthew Whitaker, the owner of Diamond Strategies LLC, says he was indeed “racially profiled” and said that the manager should have called the customer immediately. He further asked, “Why escalate that at that point?” Amy Marshall, the president and CEO of the credit union, released a statement in January on the case. She did not answer that question, saying that “at no time did the staff feel threatened or feel Mr. Brewer was trying to rob the credit union.” She also wanted it to be known that the manager has apologized to Brewer for the mix-up. Brewer claims that he has not “been inside a bank since” the incident.",U.S./Atlanta Black Star,‘Why Embarrass Someone Like That?’: Arizona Man Says He Has Not Stepped Into a Bank Since a Manager Skipped Verification Protocols to Dial 911 Over Alleged Fake Check,https://news.yahoo.com/why-embarrass-someone-arizona-man-152200467.html
3/16/2022,"It was an especially inspiring story of Ukrainian bravery, in a war replete with many of them. In video that spread quickly online on March 2, Artem Semenikhin, the mayor of the small city of Konotop, in northeastern Ukraine, stood on a planter outside the City Council and announced to a crowd that Russian soldiers had told him they would “raze the city to the ground with their artillery” if it did not surrender. Then Semenikhin asked the crowd whether they wanted to fight anyway, and the response was overwhelmingly in favor. The video was picked up by Western media outlets including Newsweek, the Daily Mail and the New York Times, which also showed a video of armed Russian troops being jeered by Konotop residents. Semenikhin was also featured in a ""PBS NewsHour"" segment, in which he referred to the Russian troops as “cockroaches.” There was just one thing missing from those accounts: the fact that Semenikhin is a member of the far-right, ultranationalist Ukrainian political party Svoboda, which emerged in 2004 from the former Social-National Party of Ukraine. In 2015, shortly after Semenikhin took office, the Jerusalem Post reported that he “refused to fly the city’s official flag at the opening meeting of the city council because he objected to the star of David emblazoned on it.” The newspaper also alleged he uses white supremacist dog whistles. One sharp-eyed observer on Twitter noticed that in Semenikhin’s interview with PBS, conducted remotely via video, one can see a painting of Ukrainian nationalist icon Stepan Bandera in the background. During World War II, Bandera led the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, which collaborated with Nazi Germany and killed Polish and Jewish civilians. At the time, Nazi troops were invading the Soviet Union, which Ukrainian nationalists were hoping to break away from. Bandera later had a falling out with the Nazi regime and was imprisoned in a concentration camp. He remains a highly controversial figure in Ukraine. After Semenikhin was elected in 2015, he replaced the portrait in the mayor’s office of then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko with one of Bandera. As a pretext for his invasion, Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly sought to connect the entire Ukrainian government to Nazis, vowing to “de-Nazify” the Kyiv regime. But Putin’s claim is absurd, based on the facts: Semenikhin's city of Konotop only had about 80,000 people before the war, while Ukrainian President Zelensky is one of the few Jewish leaders on the world stage and says he had many relatives killed in the Holocaust. Russia has been lodging this false accusation for years. In 2014, Russian state propaganda claimed that the Maidan Revolution was also backed by Nazis as the pro-Western protesters toppled Russian-backed President Viktor Yanukovych. Experts on Ukraine characterized that assertion as “entirely baseless,” according to U.S. News & World Report. That being said, like in many European countries, Ukraine does have far-right, nationalist political parties with racist tendencies. Svoboda, Semenikhin’s party, has had a number of incidents that drew widespread condemnation. Svoboda’s leader, Oleh Tyahnybok has been accused of racism and anti-Semitism for such comments as saying Ukraine was headed by a “Muscovite-Jewish mafia.” On April 20, 2018 — Adolf Hitler’s birthday — the youth movement of Svoboda, C14, destroyed a Roma settlement in Kyiv by driving out its residents and burning down their tents. It’s worth noting, however, that Svoboda no longer holds any seats in Ukraine’s parliament, whereas far-right nationalists hold seats in the parliaments of at least 19 European countries, including Hungary, Austria, Switzerland and Denmark.",World/Yahoo News,"Ukrainian mayor, heralded by many, is ultranationalist",https://news.yahoo.com/ukrainian-mayor-heralded-by-many-is-ultranationalist-161819300.html
3/16/2022,"LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Tuesday stepped up criticism of NATO following Russia's invasion of his country, questioning the alliance's commitment to its Article 5 collective defence clause. Zelenskiy said in a video address that Article 5 had never looked ""as weak as it is today."" NATO has not sent troops to defend Ukraine, which is not a member of the Western military alliance, and Zelenskiy suggested NATO would react ""in the same way"" to one of its members being attacked by Russia. NATO leaders have previously dismissed such suggestions. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a visit to Lithuania last week that the United States has a ""sacrosanct"" commitment to the Article 5 guarantee of mutual defence between member states.

3/16/2022,"It’s called “Fox & Friends,” though not every exchange is friendly. Hosts Rachel Campos-Duffy’s suggestion that the West provoked Russia’s invasion of Ukraine didn’t go unchecked by colleague Brian Kilmeade, who took a harder line against tolerating Russia’s aggression. “We should have never provoked them,” Campos-Duffy said Monday. “I mean, they made it very clear that there was a red line. The red line was neutrality for Ukraine, that they not enter NATO. And in the end, if they get this peace agreement … that’s probably going to be the case anyway … that Ukraine will promise to be neutral.” Kilmeade was significantly less interested in negotiating with a hostile invader. “Well, I’ll tell you what: You can never give in to what Russia wants other nations to do,” Kilmeade said. “They’re going to decide whether [Ukraine goes] into NATO or the European Union, when [Ukraine is] a European society that wants that?” Fox host blames the U.S. for provoking the war in Ukraine

This is why our policy makers aren’t thinking long-term — provoking this war … .” And it was at “provoking” that she lost Kilmeade altogether. “Rachel, they did not provoke the war,” he said. “They did not provoke this war.” Then, when Campos-Duffy referenced the “red line” that Russia had drawn over Ukraine … “They can’t make a red line in other countries, Rachel!” Kilmeade shot back. “It’s not up to them to make a red line in other countries! … Why should a democracy give up because Vladimir Putin is a lunatic?” See the entire exchange in the video above.",World/The Wrap,‘Fox & Friends’ Fireworks: Brian Kilmeade Shoots Down Rachel Campos-Duffy on Russia’s Ukraine War,https://news.yahoo.com/fox-friends-fireworks-brian-kilmeade-151052234.html

3/16/2022,"Russia's former chief prosecutor, Yuri Skuratov, told the BBC that Roman Abramovich made ""fraudulent deals."" Skuratov investigated Abramovich's purchase of Russian gas company Sibneft in 1995. Abramovich bought Sibneft in 1995 for $250 million. A decade later, he sold it back for $13 billion. Russia's former chief prosecutor, Yuri Skuratov, has told the BBC that Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich gained his wealth through ""fraudulent deals."" A BBC investigation looked into how Abramovich made his money, focusing on deals that he conducted with the Russian government in the 1990s. According to the report, in 1995 Abramovich purchased Russian oil company Sibneft from the government at an auction for $250 million – and sold it back for $13 billion a decade later. The report, citing Skuratov and a confidential source, alleged that Abramovich initially bought the company at a ""rigged auction"" through a ""fraudulent scheme"" with his former business associate, Boris Berezovsky. A representative for Abramovich did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. Skuratov served as Russia's Prosecutor General from 1995 to 1999 and investigated the deal at the time. ""Basically, it was a fraudulent scheme, where those who took part in the privatization formed one criminal group that allowed Abramovich and Berezovsky to trick the government and not pay the money that this company was really worth,"" Skuratov told BBC. Skuratov was forced to resign in 1999 after a political battle with then-Russian President Boris Yeltsin which culminated in the release of a video allegedly showing Skuratov in his office with two sex workers. The purported authenticity of the video was confirmed by Vladimir Putin, then the head of the FSB, Russia's spy agency. It was released just as Skuratov planned to share the names of Russian oligarchs taking bribes from a Swiss firm. ""This whole thing was obviously political, because in my investigations I came very close to the family of Boris Yeltsin, including via this investigation of the Sibneft privatization,"" Skuratov added. According to the BBC, in 2012 Berezovsky sued Abramovich, arguing that he had coerced him into selling Sibneft shares by blackmailing him. He sought billions of dollars in damages. Berezovsky lost the case. But, according to the BBC, Abramovich testified at the trial that he gave Berezovsky $10 million at the time of the Sibneft purchase to pay off a Russian official. Last Thursday, Abramovich was formally sanctioned by the UK government for ""preferential treatment and concessions from Putin."" His assets in the country, including Chelsea FC, were seized by the UK government. The soccer club will use a special license from the government to keep operating for the remainder of its season. Abramovich, who has an estimated net worth of $13.6 billion, purchased Chelsea's parent company in 2003 for $230 million.

3/16/2022,"A gunman opened fire at a Houston sushi restaurant, but nobody was injured thanks to a pair of quick-thinking MMA fighters, police said. One of those fighters? UFC standout Kevin Holland. According to local reports, a panic alarm was triggered at RA Sushi in the Highland Park neighborhood of Houston when the shooting happened at around 11:30 p.m. on Monday night. Houston Police Department Sgt. Ricardo Salas said about 40 to 50 people were inside the restaurant when the suspect fired one shot in the bar area.

Next thing you know, me and my buddy, we ran to the shooter, got him down, strangled him, took the gun from him, and then called the police. Police came and got him.” Robinson’s “buddy” was Holland, who declined to be interviewed by local media.
