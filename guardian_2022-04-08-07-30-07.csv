4/8/2022,"The Israeli embassy in Lima has led a wave of protest after Peru’s prime minister Aníbal Torres praised Adolf Hitler, on the grounds that the fascist dictator turned Germany into the “first economic power in the world”. In a week in which the government of Pedro Castillo has been engulfed in a political crisis caused by rising fuel and fertiliser prices triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – and the president’s own blundering efforts to calm the unrest – Torres’ inopportune remark on Thursday drew opprobrium from all quarters. “Regimes of death and terror cannot be a sign of progress,” read the Israeli embassy’s statement. “Hitler was responsible for the death of six million Jews, to praise him is an offense to the victims of that world tragedy.” Speaking in Huancayo, the Andean town at the centre of the ongoing protests over soaring inflation, Torres praised the road-building initiatives of Hitler and the infrastructure-building example of Italy under wartime dictator Benito Mussolini. “On one occasion Hitler visited the north of Italy, and Mussolini shows him a highway built from Milan to Brescia, Hitler saw this and went to his country and filled it with highways, airports and turned Germany into the first economic power in the world. We have to make an effort, make sacrifices to improve our roads,” he said. The 79-year-old lawyer later said his remarks were misunderstood but offered to apologize in person to the Israeli ambassador, Asaf Ichilevich. However, Peru’s Jewish Association said this was not the first time that Peruvian politicians had made such remarks. “The seriousness of these expressions do not merit explanations or half apologies.” Lawmaker Ed Málaga, who lived in Germany for 21 years, wrote an open letter to Torres demanding he apologise to the German people. “The political crisis with this government has reached the point of no return,” said Málaga, of the centrist Morado party. The German embassy in Lima said in a statement: “Adolf Hitler was a fascist and genocidal dictator, in whose name the worst war of all time was carried out from Germany and the genocide of six million Jews was committed.” “Against this backdrop, Hitler is not the right reference as an example of any kind,” it added.",News/World news,Peruvian minister draws ire after making positive remarks about Hitler,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/07/peruvian-minister-positive-remarks-hitler
4/8/2022,"People who have the Omicron Covid variant tend to have symptoms for a shorter period, a lower risk of being admitted to hospital and a different set of symptoms from those who have Delta, research has suggested. As the highly transmissible Omicron variant shot to dominance towards the end of last year, it emerged that, while it is better at dodging the body’s immune responses than Delta, it also produces less severe disease. Now a large study has not only backed up the findings, but confirmed reports Omicron is linked to a shorter duration of illness and a different collection of symptoms. The study comes just days after the NHS added nine further symptoms for Covid to its existing list of fever, a new and persistent cough, and a loss or change in taste or smell. The researchers found people who had Covid when Omicron was prevalent were about half as likely to report having at least one of the latter three symptoms as those who had Covid when Delta was rife. “It is a lesson that we need to be far more flexible in thinking what the virus is and how it is going to present than we have been, certainly in the UK,” said Prof Tim Spector, co-author of the research from King’s College London, adding that the team showed data to the government around five months ago that showed a sore throat was replacing loss of smell as a symptom. The study, which is to be presented at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases and has been published in the Lancet, is based on data from 63,002 participants of the Zoe Covid study. The researchers matched almost 4,990 participants who had a confirmed Covid infection between 1 June and 27 November 2021 – when Delta was the most prevalent variant – with 4,990 individuals who reported an infection between 20 December 2021 and 17 January 2022 when Omicron dominated, with the matching based on age, sex and whether they had received two or three vaccine doses. The experience of both groups were then compared. The team found participants’ symptoms lasted on average 6.9 days during the period when Omicron dominated, compared with 8.9 days when Delta dominated, with infections during the Omicron period linked to a 25% lower likelihood of admission to hospital. The results suggested only 17% of people who had Covid when Omicron dominated lost their sense of smell, compared with 53% when Delta dominated. However, a sore throat and going hoarse were both more common among the former. Spector said the symptom-logging approach used in the research was an invaluable tool. “[It] should alert us what to look out for when there will inevitably be the next variant,” he said, adding action needs to be quicker in the future. “We need to be much more reactive in public health messaging,” he said. Dr David Strain, a senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter Medical School, who was not involved in the study, said the findings chime with what hospitals experienced at the start of the year when the BA.1 Omicron variant dominated. But the Omicron variant BA.2 has since taken over – and, in his experience, the picture has changed again. “People in hospital are staying in hospital for longer and staff are testing positive for longer, so it is longer before they can return to work,” he said. The research came as the React-1 study revealed the average prevalence of Covid across England was at the highest level ever recorded. Meanwhile, the UK Health Security Agency reported on Thursday that 15.3% of people aged 75 and over have received their spring booster Covid jab so far.",News/World news,"Omicron variant does cause different symptoms from Delta, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/07/omicron-variant-does-cause-different-symptoms-from-delta-study-finds
4/8/2022,"Ilike to think of myself as an easy-breezy kind of gal. One of those people who impulsively follows the faintest whiff of a fun idea, like a cartoon dog floating along the scent of a pie to where it is cooling on a windowsill. But if I’m honest with myself (and you), I have to admit I am not really that person. I am someone who makes plans. I confirm numbers, I find and book restaurants, I get tickets to things in advance and I arrive embarrassingly early everywhere I go. This is why it was so surprising when last year, without planning on it at all, I accidentally moved to New Zealand. This, like most stories of slightly unhinged behaviour, can be blamed on love. During the first lockdown in 2020, when all of our lives had been tipped upside down, I started chatting with a mutual Twitter friend in Aotearoa. Even though we were living through a pandemic, and didn’t know if and when we would ever get to see each other in person, we accidentally fell extremely in love. We went through a stressful and difficult time throughout that year, but after nine months of waiting, she visited me twice for a total of about three weeks. Shortly after her second visit, things began to change again. The border between our countries was still open, but case numbers in Sydney were beginning to rise, and things looked as if they might become dicey. In a rush of heat to my little gay brain, I decided that I should surprise her with a visit as soon as possible. I wanted to spring it on her because it would be fun, but also partially so that she could be spared the stress and worry of waiting, and hoping. She would skip all of the hard stuff we’d just endured, and simply open the door one day, and I would be there. And that’s what happened. Guess who flew to New Zealand to surprise their girlfriend who immediately went into a fugue state for approx 40 seconds? Yes it was me pic.twitter.com/Of8qOzlkuU It soon became clear that I had made it in by the skin of my teeth (a disgusting idiom). It seems almost quaint now, but the plane that arrived directly after mine became big news, carrying a Covid-positive case that went on to tour Wellington. Cases in Sydney exploded, the border between the countries was shut, and I was trapped in New Zealand. I had meant to surprise my girlfriend with a week-long visit, but I accidentally surprised her with … moving into her home. There’s a popular joke stereotype about lesbians “U-Hauling”, which means moving in together shortly after beginning to date, but I think surprise moving-in from overseas after spending three weeks together in real life takes the cake. Luckily, my tendency to overprepare came in handy in this instance as even though I was only coming for a week, I had packed enough underwear to dress a family of five for months. And even though I hadn’t planned it – I hadn’t said goodbye to anyone, I had told my housemates I would be back in a week, and I hadn’t brought anything important with me – it all worked out, and I was able to settle in as if it had been my plan all along. It has almost been a year now, and it has been a strange experience, but a blessed one. Everyone has been so welcoming (we won’t mention the one older relative of my girlfriend’s who is OK with the fact she’s dating a woman, but not impressed that I am Australian) and excited to show me around. Wellington is beautiful, and I have loved getting to unexpectedly notice the little differences you pick up when you spend enough time in one place. For example, everyone here is obsessed with their native birds, and talking about birds. If you are in a group of three or more people, at some point someone in that group will begin talking about kākāpō breeding season, or will gather around in a garden to see an unusually coloured pīwakawaka. After gently teasing them about this for months, I recently found myself thinking about how the takahē and kākāpō are actually much more interesting flightless birds than the kiwi, so they should be as famous in Australia … and I knew they had gotten to me. I have delighted them in return, by making sure to share with everyone two important pieces of Australian culture they don’t know about – Steven Bradbury and Bob Katter. My favourite difference is how te reo Māori is used here. It’s not just included on signage and official forms, or talked about once a year on a designated day – it’s everywhere you go. Almost every pākehā (New Zealand European) I have met casually uses some reo Māori in conversation. It’s a small sample size, but they have all been able to teach me about the history of colonisation in this country, of important events, of the racist framework the country is based on. But equally as important, they are familiar with Māori stories of the land we are on. I say this not to praise white people for doing the absolute bare minimum, or to declare everything is perfect in Aotearoa when it clearly isn’t; I say it to emphasise how completely and utterly barren white Australia is in comparison. Living somewhere for a bit and seeing how achievable the bare minimum is makes me ashamed on a daily basis at how far behind we are. There are also other stark points of difference. For example, the sweet’n’sour sauce at McDonald’s tastes weird. Whatever the differences, and even though McNuggets taste worse, I now consider this place my second home. My spontaneity in coming to visit when I did was not only rewarded, but it actually saved us. If I hadn’t made the decision to fly that quickly, the border would have shut with me on one side and my girlfriend on the other. We would have been apart for another year. I haven’t watched Sliding Doors for a long time, but I think that timeline would be the one where Gwyneth dies. This experience, and the pandemic in general, has definitely made me more spontaneous, and a bit more audacious. Should a friend stay in her new well-paying job, or should she fly to Spain to reunite with an ex for a chance at love? The “before” me would have told her to keep that steady work. Now? I’ll take her to the damn airport myself. But we’ll still be really early. Rebecca Shaw is a writer based in Aotearoa, for now",Opinion/Opinion,Last year I accidentally moved to New Zealand.

4/8/2022,"Caroline Kennedy, the nominee for US ambassador to Australia, has said the Aukus security deal will provide “a lot of deterrence” in the Indo-Pacific even before the nuclear-powered submarines are ready. With Australia set to enter a federal election campaign within days, Kennedy praised the country for standing firm with “a bipartisan foreign policy” in the face of “Chinese economic coercion”. But she also said the prospect of a security agreement between China and Solomon Islands showed the US needed to be “more visible” in the Pacific. Kennedy said the US move to reopen its embassy in Solomon Islands “can’t come soon enough”. Kennedy, a former ambassador to Japan and the daughter of John F Kennedy, described the US relationship with Australia as vital when she addressed the US Senate committee on foreign relations early on Friday Australia time. The hearing is a crucial step before US senators vote on whether to confirm her as ambassador. Kennedy mentioned Beijing’s trade actions against a range of Australian export sectors – including coal, barley and wine – that the Australian government viewed as an attempt to pressure it to change its policies on China. “Australia most recently has been challenged by Chinese economic coercion and I think that the United States can learn a lot from their response,” Kennedy told the confirmation hearing. “They’ve stood firm and I think they’ve managed to come together with a bipartisan foreign policy and I think a greater and deeper partnership with us in the security and diplomatic areas as well as across the board.” Kennedy was careful not to wade into Australian domestic politics. But her acknowledgment of bipartisan foreign policy is notable, given that the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has previously attempted to claim the Labor opposition would be weak on China. The Republican former presidential candidate Mitt Romney told the confirmation hearing the US had been “very impressed by the backbone that’s been shown by the people of Australia”. Some critics have questioned the significance of last September’s Aukus agreement, given that the first of Australia’s new nuclear-propelled submarines are not expected to be operating until the late 2030s. But Kennedy said the “ambitious 21st century partnership” of Australia, the US and the UK was much broader than submarines. Other areas of security cooperation under the Aukus banner included artificial intelligence, quantum and cyber, she said. This week the three countries added discussions on hypersonic weapons to the list. “I think that there is a lot of deterrence that it will deliver well before the submarines are in operation,” Kennedy said. She also described the Quad – an increasingly active diplomatic grouping of Australia, the US, Japan and India – as “a very powerful alliance and combination”. China, which is rapidly modernising its own military force, has criticised both Aukus and the Quad. Beijing argues the US is trying to form “an exclusive clique” while “stoking opposition and confrontation”. Kennedy said the Indo-Pacific had became “increasingly tense” since her time as US ambassador to Japan from 2013 to 2017, and the liberal international order was being “undermined”. The climate crisis was also raised at the hearing, amid efforts by the Biden administration to encourage Australia to take more ambitious medium-term action. Robert Menendez, the committee chairman, said Australia was “a microcosm of the global climate crisis”. He noted the impact of recent flooding disasters in Queensland and New South Wales, the Black Summer bushfires, and threats to the Great Barrier Reef. “This is an incredibly important relationship,” Menendez said. “But there are great lessons for the United States to learn how to prepare for such extreme climate disasters and how to get Australia to think about the climate responsibilities they have as well, in their own interests as well as the global interest.” Kennedy said: “Certainly Australia has learned a lot about these kinds of disasters and we also have been impacted by fires and floods and storms here in the United States. “So the more that we can learn … how to combat and also move toward a clean energy transition and reduce the impacts of climate change, the faster we can do that [the better]. If confirmed, I would be eager to work on that.” The US has been pressing Australia to strengthen its 2030 emission reduction target, but the Coalition has kept it at the Tony Abbott-era level of a 26% to 28% cut compared with 2005 levels. Labor pledges to cut emissions by 43% by 2030 if elected. When Joe Biden announced the nomination of Kennedy four months ago, both major Australian political parties welcomed the choice, seeing it as a senior appointment of a well-connected figure who would have the president’s ear. Without a US ambassador in place in Canberra, senior diplomat Mike Goldman has been serving as the embassy’s charge d’affaires.",News/World news,Caroline Kennedy praises Australia’s bipartisan foreign policy despite PM’s claims on Labor and China ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/08/caroline-kennedy-praises-australias-bipartisan-foreign-policy-despite-pms-claims-on-labor-and-china
4/8/2022,"The dream seemed to be over at half-time. West Ham had just lost Aaron Cresswell to a hugely controversial red card and at that stage it was hard not to feel that Lyon were going to run away with this Europa League quarter-final. But David Moyes has made West Ham tough. Powered by injustice after seeing Felix Zwayer dismiss Cresswell for fouling Moussa Dembele, the 10 men dug in and took the lead through Jarrod Bowen. Lyon had to scrap and West Ham will travel to France with hope next week, even though Tanguy Ndombele cancelled out their lead. It was far too early for West Ham to start thinking about a potential semi-final against Barcelona. This was another imposing test and Moyes knew better than to focus on the odds favouring his team. After all, Lyon were Champions League semi-finalists two years ago and, although their domestic form has been inconsistent this season, they remain an accomplished team and it quickly became clear that they were capable of making life uncomfortable for West Ham. It was a classic case of an experienced side drawing the sting from the occasion. Roared on by a passionate home crowd, West Ham overwhelmed Sevilla in the last 16 and Lyon did not want to suffer a similar fate. They wanted the game to be played at their pace and their intricate passing soon caused problems. There were possibilities when Lyon played through Houssem Aouar and the opening goal almost arrived when Lucas Paquetá broke down the left, only for Dembélé to turn the Brazilian’s cross wide. Playing in their first European quarter-final since 1981, West Ham were edgy for a while. Tomas Soucek and Declan Rice struggled to keep the ball away from Tanguy Ndombele and Thiago Mendes, although there was hope on the break. They threatened when Craig Dawson’s raking ball released Saïd Benrahma, whose shot was saved by Anthony Lopes, then when Michail Antonio rumbled through and saw his effort blocked by Castello Lukeba. On the whole, though, Lukeba and Jérôme Boateng stood up to Antonio. West Ham were not measured enough in the final third, with Jarrod Bowen unable to affect the game from the right, and there were howls of frustration when Benrahma wasted a couple of promising positions. The game had become cagey. Rice drew a good save from Lopes from 20 yards. Boateng, Ndombele and Malo Gusto wound up the crowd by making too much of nothing challenges. Little was happening and it was hard to imagine that Moyes would be waiting on the touchline to berate the officials at half-time, West Ham’s manager incandescent after seeing his side reduced to 10 men when Cresswell’s foul on Dembélé was deemed to have denied the Lyon forward a clear goalscoring opportunity. It was hugely questionable from Zwayer, who had waved away Bowen’s appeals for a free-kick moments before Aouar sent Dembélé racing beyond Kurt Zouma. Dembélé even winked at his teammates after Cresswell was ordered off for a foolish tug of his opponent’s shirt. The striker’s touch had taken him away from goal, while Zouma was covering, and it felt ludicrous that there was no intervention from VAR. Moyes was booked for his protests, although he will probably have questions about Cresswell’s defending as well. West Ham’s left-back had panicked and his dismissal tilted the contest in Lyon’s favour, especially with Benrahma off and Ben Johnson as an extra defender. Inevitably Lyon dominated territory. West Ham, though, had a plan of attack. They threatened when Antonio ran at Lukeba, then when Fornals dribbled in from the left. Suddenly Lyon were ragged. Gusto did not do enough to stop Fornals and when the Spaniard prodded the ball on to Boateng it ran through to Bowen, whose messy shot hit the Lyon defender and bounced over Lopes. West Ham chased a second, Antonio going close. Lyon needed fresh ideas and Peter Bosz sent on Tetê and Karl Toko Ekambi for Boateng and Romain Faivre. The changes paid off instantly, Tetê dribbling beyond Johnson and firing in a low ball that Alphonse Areola and Ryan Fredericks failed to clear, allowing Ndombele to equalise from close range. From there The question was whether Lyon would score again. West Ham refused to let it happen.",Sport/Football,West Ham battle to Europa League draw with Lyon after Cresswell’s red card,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/07/west-ham-lyon-europa-league-quarter-final-first-leg-match-report
4/8/2022,"Rangers needed a response to the weekend’s crushing setback against Celtic, which effectively ended their title hopes, and did enough here to ensure their Europa League quarter-final remains finely poised. The regret will be that they conceded to Braga’s Abel Ruiz in the 40th minute during the only spell when they were truly under the cosh. Otherwise they showed up well in a largely uneventful affair and will consider the Portuguese side vulnerable at Ibrox. The big encouragement Rangers can hold is that they have passed this very test before, albeit with wins in both legs. In February 2020 they beat Braga twice in the round of 32, winning the away fixture with a goal from Ryan Kent. Within five minutes of kick-off he had come close to repeating the trick: a beautiful ball from Scott Arfield created the chance, sending Kent free, but a heavy touch allowed the goalkeeper Matheus to shovel away. Fashion Sakala’s follow-up was blocked but the episode characterised Rangers’ lively start. Arfield then almost located Sakala after slick play by Kent. Braga were concerned when Matheus needed treatment as a result of that early intervention and there was little reason to expect Rangers could not continue thriving. Braga were rattled by their visitors’ speed. Glen Kamara, one of three reintroductions to the starting XI after their Old Firm defeat, was hauled over by one centre-back, Fabiano, and then chopped down by another in David Carmo. When examined, though, Rangers courted danger. A cross from Yan Couto, the excellent Manchester City loanee, caused consternation that led to Ricardo Horta rapping the post. Then the other Horta, his brother André, found the bottom corner but VAR intervened for an infringement by Fabiano. In response Sakala blasted over but five minutes before the break Braga exposed them critically. A smart right-sided move ended with Ruiz, who got an awkward ball out of his feet and whipped low around Allan McGregor from 15 yards. This time it counted. Matheus earned applause with a dink to get past Arfield 10 minutes after the interval. Rangers had held their own since half-time without getting behind their hosts. Arfield saw one volley blocked; Braga were hardly overcommitting and a sense grew of the scoreline being mutually acceptable. A triple substitution by Giovanni van Bronckhorst, with Kemar Roofe among those introduced, suggested that might not necessarily be the case but proceedings were scratchy and tight. In the 71st minute, though, Connor Goldson should have levelled when the Braga defence froze at a corner. He was all alone and had to do better than head wide. Rangers pressed late on and, had Alfredo Morelos not been ruled out for the season’s remainder, perhaps he would have conjured something. As it is, the tie remains alive. “We know the task ahead,” Van Bronckhorst said. “Next week we play at home with the crowd behind us. The atmosphere is very hostile, overwhelming at times, and you saw after 70 minutes [Braga] dropped their energy levels a bit. We have to give all our energy to get into the semis.”",Sport/Football,Abel Ruiz’s winner gives Braga narrow first-leg victory over Rangers,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/07/braga-rangers-europa-league-quarter-final-first-leg-match-report
4/8/2022,"There were about 50,000 people at Augusta National for the start of the Masters: fans, media, members, stewards, caddies, cooks, camera crew and all the other support staff, and day morning almost every last one of them was asking the same sort of question. Plenty had come along to the 1st tee at 11am to find out the answer, too. The dogged ones had staked a front-row spot first thing that morning. Everyone else was craning their necks and popping up on their tiptoes, jockeying to try to find a line of sight that would allow them to and catch a flash of Tiger Woods in his shocking pink shirt. Could Woods still do it? Even Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player were going back and forth after the opening ceremony. Nicklaus wasn’t sure. “Feeling competitive is different than feeling like you can win,” he said after he’d hit the ceremonial tee shot. “I mean, I’m sure Tiger will be very competitive this week. But I don’t know whether he can win or not. He hasn’t played any competition for a long time.” It’s 508 days, to be exact. Player disagreed. “There’s no reason why not. As long as he does something which is absolutely imperative, and that’s to believe that he can.” There’s no doubt about that part, at least. Like Woods said, he wouldn’t be here otherwise. What was less clear was whether he was kidding himself, and everyone else, when he insisted that his game was up to it. It became clear pretty quickly that he wasn’t. Woods covered the five holes in even par, although when his first putt went in the roar was so loud it tricked a lot of people into thinking he must have done something spectacular. Since Woods’s name was not up on any of the big white scoreboards dotted around the course, and Augusta’s strict rules meant that no one had a phone handy to tell them any better, the whisper went around that he had in fact birdied the first. “He’s in great shape to make another,” said a man at the 2nd after Woods had hit his second shot down to the slope in front of the green. “I heard he couldn’t even swing after the accident,” someone said as Woods was standing over his chip. “He was like a total beginner.” He was all anybody was talking about. “I think his win here in ’19 was the greatest comeback ever” and “none of us had him to win then, either” and “I think he’s going to run out of steam” and “just making the cut here would be a win for him” and “I can’t wait to tell my mama that I saw Tiger Woods”. His partners, Louis Oosthuizen and Joaquín Niemann, didn’t figure in the conversation, even though the latter was playing some brilliant golf. Woods on the other hand was playing good, steady stuff, a little less spectacular than the crowd would have liked. They were quiet when he left a poor putt from off the front of the green short on the 3rd, and again on the 4th when he missed with another putt from the fringe. It felt as if he was feeling his way back into it, in tricky conditions. The course had been softened by two days of torrential rain but the sub-air drainage system was hard at work, sucking up the groundwater. Overhead the wind was starting to carry away the thick cold, clouds and drizzle. By the time the group got to the 5th the sun was out for the first time all week. The crowd sighed for him there when a 15ft birdie putt caught the lip and flipped out, and they roared at the 6th when he picked up his first birdie (for real this time) after hitting his tee-shot to 2ft. His recovery at the 7th was even better. His drive fetched up in a patch of pine straw down the right side, nestled between three tree trunks, but he whipped his second right up to the front of the green, 30 yards shy, then hit a superb chip to 2ft. “Well you can break my leg,” one man said. ‘And stick a metal rod in it too,” his friend chimed in. Woods always did know how to get himself out of a tight spot. He did drop a shot at the next, where he made two mistakes back to back after missing the green with his first chip and then hitting his second 5ft by. It all started to get a little wild after that. There were some bad misses, some brilliant recoveries and a couple of breathtaking putts. He saved par after he hit a wild drive at the 9th but didn’t when he made the mistake again, worse this time, at the 14th, after his foot almost seemed to slip midway through his swing. That bogey cost him the shot he’d just picked up at the 13th, where he had a tap-in after his eagle putt from 23ft finished short. The 15th was hairy too, as he hopped his way down through the trees along the left side and flopped on to the green. And then he pulled out a 29ft birdie putt at the par-3 16th. At the end of it all, he scrambled his way down the 18th and finished one under par. “Right where I want to be,” he said. He’s going to compete alright, Nicklaus was right about that. By Sunday we will find out whether Player was too. A lot of people would say it was a victory just to make it here. But Woods has different ideas about what winning is.",Sport/Sport,Tiger Woods stays steady as flashes of magic suggest there’s more to come | Andy Bull,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/07/tiger-woods-stays-steady-as-flashes-of-magic-suggest-theres-more-to-come
4/8/2022,"Good morning. Russia’s war in Ukraine “going to be a long slog” America’s top General Mark Milley has warned. In Australia, more residents have been ordered to evacuate their homes in NSW amid predictions of historic flooding. It comes as Sydney surpasses its average annual rainfall in just over three months of 2022. Russia has been suspended from the United Nations’ leading human rights body as its invasion of Ukraine continues to provoke revulsion and outrage around the world. At a meeting of the UN general assembly on Thursday, 93 members voted in favour of the diplomatic rebuke while 24 were against and 58 abstained. “War criminals have no place in UN bodies aimed at protecting human rights,” Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, tweeted in response. “Grateful to all member states which … chose the right side of history.” Radio transmissions in which Russian soldiers appear to talk among themselves about carrying out premeditated civilian killings in Ukraine have been intercepted by Germany’s foreign intelligence service, a source close to the findings has said. And Western observers fear that genocidal language in Russian media may prompt more war crimes. Australian Border Force officials searched 822 travellers’ mobile phones in 2021, despite admitting it has no power to force arrivals to give them the passcode to their devices. In January, Sydney software developer James told Guardian Australia that he and his partner were stopped on their return from Fiji by border force officials who asked them to write their phone passcodes on a piece of paper before taking the codes and their phones to another room to examine for half an hour. The phones were then returned and they were allowed to leave. Border force confirmed the practice was allowed under the Customs Act, but declined to expand on how often it was used, or what officers did with the devices once unlocked. Facebook owner Meta Platforms has removed a network of social media accounts with ties to the Brazilian military that posed as fake non-profits to play down the dangers of deforestation. The comments by Meta, published in a quarterly report, pose a reputational risk to Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro. The far-right former army captain, a longtime sceptic of environmentalism, has deployed the armed forces to the Amazon on unsuccessful missions to reduce destruction of the world’s largest rainforest. Although the individuals involved in the network were active military personnel, Meta’s investigation did not find enough evidence to establish if they were following orders or acting independently, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Craig Kelly is being investigated for billing taxpayers to fly to anti-vaccine mandate, anti-lockdown rallies in Melbourne, internal records show. Kelly, the leader of the United Australia party, charged taxpayers for his flights to and from Melbourne for two rallies in November and December last year, which were organised chiefly as protests against Victoria’s pandemic powers and the Victorian premier, Dan Andrews. Scott Morrison is moving to head off an electoral backlash in South Australia after the prime minister appeared to water down the government’s commitment to building Aukus nuclear-powered submarines in Adelaide. A former supreme court associate who says she was forced out of her job after it was revealed she was in a sexual relationship with a Tasmanian judge has lodged a complaint with the state’s equal opportunity commission. Australia has rolled back a ban on exporting sheep to the Middle East during the hottest months of the year in a move animal rights groups say ignores scientific recommendations introduced to protect animal welfare. Shanghai is allowing at least some parents to stay with children infected with Covid-19, making an exception to a policy of isolating anyone who tests positive after a public outcry. The announcement came as China’s largest city remained in lockdown and conducted more mass testing on Wednesday following another jump in new cases. Donald Trump has said he regrets not marching on the US Capitol building with his supporters on the day of the January 6 insurrection and again rejected suggestions he used “burner phones” on the day of the assault. A Turkish court has confirmed a request from prosecutors to transfer the case against the alleged assassins of Jamal Khashoggi to Saudi Arabia, shutting down a trial that had been a centrepiece of attempts to cast light on the plot and expose the hit squad’s ultimate leader.
