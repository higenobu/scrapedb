3/14/2022,"The late winter light illuminates the lichens on the spire of the stained sandstone steeple. A single drifting white feather tells me we arrived too late. Tracing its trajectory in reverse, I find the peregrine tucked into a niche by the belfry, perched on a strut that holds a floodlight over the graveyard. The falcon, a small and well-fed tercel, has been here since the turn of the year, gargoyling the nooks and ledges of the church, haunting the town’s pigeons. The ground between the headstones is decorated with their spent feathers. Even on its high perch, sated, the peregrine possesses an attention-grabbing presence. It leans forward, excretes and preens its pale breast feathers that stand out in the sun against the dark stone. I try to slip binoculars from my pocket but I hear you grizzle. I take the hint. I am getting used to binoculars no longer hanging around my neck. More precious cargo now rests against my chest. I am growing used to the reduced horizons. These are strange but brilliant days, keen with beauty after a winter shrunk to the half-lit four rooms of our flat, when the world disappeared in a blur of caffeine and urgent needs and next-day deliveries. I brought you here because I want you to have this, the naturalist’s life: the gift of being distracted by what is happening outside and knowing what that means. But you, my four-month-old daughter, don’t know this yet. Books detail the way that your eyes began, knowing only a world of limited colours, a horizon of 30cm and no focus. Over your first year this improves until vision is completely developed, meaning that day by slow day the sunsets in your world get more vivid, your outlook more expansive, more real in ways I can’t see or imagine. I can’t wait to see you seeing a bird for the first time, whether peregrine or pigeon. All I keep coming back to are two sentences that feel like a prayer. There is so much beauty in this world. You have it all to come.

3/14/2022,"Queensland’s human rights commissioner has warned the state’s lawmakers a “vacuum of oversight” could undermine public faith crucial to responding to future pandemics should they extend the chief health officer emergency powers. Commissioner Scott McDougall told a parliamentary committee on Monday it should reject the Palaszczuk government’s move to extend those powers by another six months and instead replace the temporary measures with “fit-for-purpose, pandemic legislation” that was “transparent, accountable and more compatible with human rights”. The state’s health minister, Yvette D’Ath, is seeking to extend the temporary powers, introduced in January 2020, through to the end of October. McDougall said the state should “follow the lead” of Victoria and the ACT and allow for greater transparency and parliamentary oversight of the decision to grant emergency powers. “At present, confusion over whether or not the CHO’s public health directions are legislative or administrative in nature means that they exist in a potential vacuum of oversight,” he said. Under the Victorian model, the health minister must accompany a declaration of emergency with a statement of reasons, the advice given by the CHO and a statement of compatibility with human rights, McDougall said. Also, the CHO’s directions were administrative, meaning they would be “disallowable” by parliament. “That is a really effective and open, transparent model,” the commissioner said. “We’ve been advocating for something similar to that right from the outset of this pandemic.” McDougall said the state government had done “an excellent job of keeping Queenslanders safe” throughout the pandemic and acknowledged its “commitment to protecting the right to life”. But he said the emergency phase of the pandemic was “arguably behind us” or the state was at least “in between emergency phases”, making now the time to lay the legislative groundwork to respond to future waves. McDougall said the success of the state in handling the pandemic to date had rested upon the confidence of Queenslanders in the decision-making process and the public’s willingness to accept “extraordinary restrictions on their human rights”. The government, however, could not necessarily count on the same public sentiment during a future wave of the pandemic and the “very tough” decisions that would herald, he warned. “[D]ecisions are going to have to be made by government [that] are going to be very tough and the appetite of the public to forgo their rights is really going to be tested,” McDougall said. But clarifying how the Human Rights Act applied to public health directions could help retain the required goodwill. “That will continue public confidence in decision making that is going to be essential for dealing with future waves of the pandemic,” McDougall said. Health minister Yvette D’Ath argues the extension of emergency powers is necessary so the state can remain vigilant against the rapid and unpredictable spread of the coronavirus. She has said the CHO’s ability to issue directions, such as the requirement of quarantine for unvaccinated travellers entering Queensland, would be needed to keep the state safe from future waves and variants. The president of the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties, Michael Cope, wrote in a submission to parliament that the minister’s argument failed to justify the continuation of emergency powers. “If it does justify such an extension, it would justify an extension of those powers for so long as the virus is circulating in our community, which given the current state of our medicine will be forever,” he wrote. “An emergency cannot last forever.”",News/Australia news,Queensland human rights commissioner warns against extending Covid emergency powers,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/14/queensland-human-rights-commissioner-warns-against-extending-covid-emergency-powers
3/14/2022,"New Zealand is halving public transport fares to ease the pain of sharply rising petrol costs, as fuel oil prices soar following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, announced that the country would cut fares by 50% amid a suite of other changes to try to ease sharp increases in the cost of living. The government is also cutting petrol excise duties and road user charges by 25c a litre – changes that will come in at midnight on Monday. The finance minister, Grant Robertson, said the changes would last for an initial three months and then be reviewed. “The global energy crisis has quickly become acute,” Ardern said. “We cannot control the war in Ukraine nor the continued volatility of fuel prices but we can take steps to reduce the impact on New Zealand families.” Petrol prices in New Zealand are over NZ$3 ($2) a litre and have been rising sharply in recent weeks. Unleaded petrol has gone up 15% since the start of the year and is expected to continue to rise. “In the long term we need to build greater resilience into our transport system so we are less vulnerable to spikes in the price of petrol,” Ardern said. “But for now halving the cost public transport will provide some families with an alternative to filling up the tank.” Even with the changes, the government expected petrol prices would continue their upward trajectory, Robertson said. “We do need to recognise that petrol prices are expected to continue to rise,” he said. “The Russian invasion of Ukraine is continuing to undermine and destabilise global energy markets and, added to the other inflationary pressures the world has due to Covid supply chain disruptions, this is sadly not over yet.” The Ardern government has come under growing pressure to address rising cost of living in New Zealand, where households have faced significant increases in the cost of living and supermarket essentials. Inflation in Aotearoa has hit a three-decade high, and is showing no sign of slowing. Inflation reached 5.9% at the end of 2021, and ANZ, the country’s biggest bank, expects it to continue rising in 2022. In February, fruit and vegetable costs were up 17% year-on-year. New Zealand’s opposition has declared the country has a “cost of living crisis”. In recent polling, the Ardern-led Labour party fell behind the centre-right opposition, National, for the first time since the pandemic began.",News/World news,New Zealand halves public transport fares as petrol prices soar amid Russia-Ukraine war ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/new-zealand-halves-public-transport-fares-as-petrol-prices-soar-amid-russia-ukraine-war
3/14/2022,"Belarusian armed forces are pushing asylum seekers from the Middle East who became trapped in the country after they were promised passage to the EU to cross the border into war-torn Ukraine, according to the testimony of people in Belarusian camps. Dozens of asylum seekers stuck for months in a makeshift dormitory in Bruzgi, a village in Belarus less than a mile from the Polish border, were ordered by a group of Belarusian soldiers on 5 March to leave the building at gunpoint and given two options: crossing the border into Poland, where guards have beaten them back, or entering Ukraine, one of them said. “A group of seven border guard officers that we had never seen before entered the building,” said a man who arrived in Belarus last autumn, and whose name and nationality cannot be disclosed for security reasons. “They wore military clothes and, for the first time, they entered the camp holding weapons, beating us and telling us that we had two choices – either crossing into Poland or going to Ukraine.” The EU last autumn accused Belarus’s leader, Alexander Lukashenko, of deliberately provoking a refugee crisis on its eastern frontier by organising the movement of people from the Middle East to Minsk and promising them a safe passage to the bloc. The move was seen as reprisal for sanctions that Brussels imposed on his regime after his crackdown on civil society and political opponents. Belarusian authorities in November escorted thousands of people to the Polish frontier in an escalation of the crisis. Witnesses told the Guardian how Belarusian troops had gathered groups of up to 50 people and cut the barbed wire with shears to allow them to cross. Hundreds managed to evade the Polish police by hiding in the forests, but others were caught and violently pushed back to Belarus. As temperatures plummeted, Belarusian authorities began to move those who were unable to cross the frontier into Poland to a giant customs warehouse, turned into a dormitory, in Bruzgi. More than a thousand of them have spent almost four months there, crammed between industrial shelving units, where people built makeshift cots using wooden planks and cardboard boxes. Ten days after Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, which is backed by Belarus, the orders were given to empty the camp. The man explained that that day, Belarusian soldiers began to inspect “every inch of the camp”, entering each tent and gathering people in order to communicate the new directives. “Everyone was wondering what our future would be,” he said. “We are peaceful people. There are families with children. What do these armed men want from us?” At that point, the military group reported that they had received the order to clear the dormitory. “They made us sit on the ground,” explained the man, “and the officer again asked people if they wanted to go to Poland or Ukraine. Poland or Ukraine. This is the new way of smuggling people for the Belarusians.” Despite the arrival of more than a million Ukrainians displaced in Poland, refugee-focused charities in the country haven’t stopped supporting people who crossed the Polish-Belarusian border. Anna Alboth, of Minority Rights Group, and one of the co-founders of Grupa Granica, a Polish network of NGOs monitoring the situation on the border, said they had noticed an increase in asylum seekers crossing from Belarus to Poland lately, corroborating the testimonies of migrants being ordered to leave the camp in Belarus. “The Polish border guards are still pushing them back to Belarus every day,” she said. “Even yesterday, we were in contact with a Syrian family of 10, including a few kids. Unfortunately, we didn’t manage to help them with food and clothes, because they were already pushed back to Belarus.” Charities fear that asylum seekers will be again used as weapons, opening a new crisis on the Polish north-eastern border that risks causing unprecedented political and logistical chaos in a country struggling to deal the mass migration of Ukranians fleeing the war. “What if Belarusians this time will push them not to Lithuania or Poland, but to … Ukraine?” Alboth said. “Belarusians don’t care about the lives of those people, this we know since last August already. Belarusians were provoking the refugees on the border already in autumn, recording hateful videos to spread anti-migration propaganda in Poland and in Europe. Those were videos that put in very bad light all the migrants and representatives of different minorities on the Belarusian side. What if they were keeping them in Bruzgi since November, because they knew that they could use them?” Lukashenko has become closer to Putin in recent months and Russian troops were stationed on the Belarus-Ukraine border before last month’s invasion. In a recent interview with the Guardian, the exiled Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said she believes, after the invasion of Ukraine by Russian troops, Lukashenko has in effect ceded control of his country to the Kremlin. “We are trying to persuade Belarusian troops not to participate,” Tsikhanouskaya said. “We are communicating with mothers of soldiers, trying to persuade them not to let their children go to this war.” Some of the migrants who were asked to go to Ukraine initially feared that Belarusian soldiers wanted to offer them a chance to fight alongside the Russians – an offer that the wife of an asylum seeker trapped in Bruzgi said they would have all refused. Putin gave the green light for what he claimed would be up to 16,000 volunteers from the Middle East deployed alongside Russian-backed rebels fighting in Ukraine, as the two-week-old invasion struggled to maintain momentum. Syria’s military has begun recruiting troops from its own ranks to fight alongside Russian forces in Ukraine, promising payments of $3,000 a month – up to 50 times a Syrian soldier’s monthly salary.",News/Global development,Fears grow of new crisis as refugees in Belarus driven into Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/14/fears-grow-of-new-crisis-as-refugees-in-belarus-driven-into-ukraine
