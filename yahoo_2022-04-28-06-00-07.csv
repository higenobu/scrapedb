In recent months, TikTokers have shared what it’s like to be an overnight stocker at Walmart, an NFL water boy and a full-time pianist at luxury hotels. Morgan’s TikTok came in response to a Stitch video trend asking users to reveal something about their profession that others would be “shocked” to know. In her post, Morgan explains that she works as a notary in the real estate and loan industry. For that job, she gets paid $100-$250 per hour. Morgan’s estimate seems to be in line with figures from the notary website ProperSign, which estimates that notary signing agents can typically make $75-$200 per hour when working in real estate and loans. NBA and NFL star stylist Dex Robinson's must-haves for a night out with the fellas: However, a high hourly rate doesn’t automatically mean a high salary. Since notaries are dependent upon real estate transactions for work, many often work only when they have signings to witness. These “mobile notaries” make good money when they work, but their roles are usually only part time. Full-time notaries can make great money, depending on their skill set and location. The National Notary Association estimates that 16% of full-time notaries make at least $7,500 per month, or $90,000 per year. TikTok commenters were largely surprised by Morgan’s video. “Where do I sign up?” one user wrote. “I’m in the wrong business!” “Googling ‘how to become a notary,'” another added. “Yes it’s true!” another agreed. “I did this for 15 years.” Many users asked Morgan how they could get into the real estate notary business. So, she posted a follow-up video explaining how she got started. As the TikToker posted in her caption, there’s no college degree required.

4/28/2022,"Local authorities in Canada are investigating an attack that left a 14-year-old student unconscious inside a high school in the city of Richmond.

Janice Xie, a Grade 9 student at Hugh Boyd Secondary School, said a 17-year-old Grade 11 student beat her up in a school corridor and left her with head injuries on Thursday.

The victim said she was going down the stairs during lunchtime when the older student ran after her. He then started punching her and insulting her.

""He called me a homophobic slur. He called me the 'F' slur and said all Asians are ugly and that he hates all Asians,"" Xie was quoted as saying.

She told CTV that prior to the incident, her attacker had never interacted with her.

""He thought I was telling people he liked another girl when I didn't,” she said. “And I don't think I could've known anyways because I've never even spoke [sic] to him at all before that.""

Xie, who was rushed to the hospital for treatment, suffered a concussion. She said the incident made her afraid of returning to school.

The victim’s mother, Jordana Sorensen, rushed to the school after being told that Xie passed out twice after being kicked and punched.

Tim Sorensen, the victim’s father, later learned that their daughter was repeatedly hit in the face as she was lying on the ground until other students intervened. He said local authorities informed him that the alleged attacker would be formally charged with assault.

The incident is currently under investigation by the local Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in Richmond.

According to Cpl. Ian Henderson, the male student involved was apprehended at the scene and released to a legal guardian.

""Due to privacy concerns and the confines of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, Richmond RCMP cannot release further details or the names of those involved,"" Henderson wrote in a statement.

Henderson said details about the suspect were not released to the media in accordance with the Youth Criminal Justice Act, which states that information about a young offender must not be published.

Despite Xie’s fear of returning to school, she said she has been receiving support from friends and school counselors.

""Even though I was scared to go back, my friends made me feel better,"" Xie shared. ""Everyone was texting me… they all comforted me and said I can stay with you the whole day if you want and [they'll] walk me to class and they'll just stick by my side.""

David Sadler, director of communications for the Richmond School District, released a statement to CBC noting that the school board is aware of its responsibility to foster a ""positive climate and a safe, healthy environment.""

Sadler also wrote that every member of their school’s community must act in an ""ethical, lawful manner that demonstrates respect"" for others.

A family friend, Susan Tran, has launched a campaign on GoFundMe to help fund Xie’s “trauma counseling, medical and physical therapy.” According to Tran, a portion of the raised amount will be used to help her and her family “get justice for this horrendous act.”

4/28/2022,"Russia's Gazprombank turned down a ruble payment from a trading firm Germany had seized from Moscow, Bloomberg reported. The payment was for some April and May gas deliveries to Germany and Austria. On Wednesday, Russia halted gas supplies for Poland and Bulgaria. Russia's Gazprombank turned down a ruble payment from a trading firm Germany had seized from Moscow, sources told Bloomberg. The payment for some April and May gas deliveries to Germany and Austria was rejected even though the trading firm — Gazprom Marketing & Trading (GM&T) — offered to pay in rubles, as Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded. GM&T previously was controlled by the German subsidiary of Russian state-run Gazprom, but Germany took over the unit in April. Now, the rejected ruble payment suggests Moscow looks to shut out a German-controlled GM&T. The trading firm, which is among many that import gas to Germany, is still in talks with Gazprombank to push the transaction through, sources told Bloomberg. The standoff comes as the Kremlin uses its energy exports to retaliate against Western nations that have imposed sanctions on Russia for its war on Ukraine. On Wednesday, Moscow halted natural gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, sending European gas prices up 28% and adding to concerns that Putin could target other nations on the continent. Gazprom said the reason for the gas halt is that both countries failed to pay in rubles. Meanwhile, four European gas buyers have paid Russia in rubles for supplies, complying with Moscow's demands, according to Bloomberg, which also said 10 European countries have opened accounts at Gazprombank to make ruble payments.
