2/12/2022,"Today’s political culture is “rancid and dangerous” and Boris Johnson should be ashamed of telling a lie that led to street violence, a senior Church of England bishop has said. Paul Bayes, the bishop of Liverpool, said the UK was facing a “struggle between those in whose interest it is to fragment society and those who want to sustain the common good”.  Speaking on the eve of his retirement, Bayes also said church law should change to define marriage as between two people regardless of gender – a highly controversial move that would overturn centuries of traditional biblical teaching. Bayes said Johnson should take “serious stock of his position” after he told parliament that Keir Starmer had failed to prosecute the paedophile Jimmy Savile. Two days later, Starmer had to seek refuge from a mob accusing him of being a “paedophile protector”. Bayes said: “I do not believe that was an honest statement, and I think [Johnson] should be ashamed of it. And the folks who trotted out to say ‘it’s not really a problem, it’s all part of the rough and tumble of politics’ should share that shame … “The parallel in my mind is Donald Trump. [Johnson] is showing us who he is, and people seem to want that in politics. And I regret that. We need a politics that doesn’t have room for lies told in the House of Commons that might produce street violence two days afterwards.” However, if Johnson resigned, the political environment would still need to change, Bayes said. “It’s not about individual bad apples. It’s about the culture.” The culture of politics was “adversarial, scratchy, exhausted” and “rancid and dangerous”. This was the case “right across the west”, he said. “You see clear illiberalism in eastern Europe, you see the rise of the extreme right in France, and you see what you see in the United States … Basic decencies have been lost.” People who suggested that bishops should not express political views were mistaken, he said. The church has “a place in the public square” and “there are values that we can express clearly that will have political impact. As long as that platform is there, it behoves us to stand on it.” Within the C of E, Bayes has increasingly spoken out about the urgency of LGBTQ+ equality, an issue that has caused bitter divisions for many years. He said: “I want to see a church where, if a congregation and its ministers want to bless and marry same-sex people or trans people, then they should be free to do so without stigma. And those who don’t want to do so should be given freedom of conscience not to do so. I want to see gender-neutral marriage canons, that simply say marriage is between two people.” Bayes said he expected this to happen, “100%”. The church needs to listen “to God who never changes, and to society which is changing all the time. Over slavery, over abortion, contraception, women’s ministry, long and agonised debates have resulted in a church that has made room for these things. And I think, in the end, that will happen [with LGBTQ+ equality]. He didn’t expect such change imminently, but “I hope and pray it will happen in my lifetime”. Bayes, who has been bishop of Liverpool since 2014, was introduced as a member of the House of Lords in November, just three months before his retirement. “I would have been there for five or six years but there was a [C of E] rule that women bishops should take precedence. I support that rule, but it means I’m the shortest serving member of the House of Lords for decades. But that’s cool.” After his retirement, he will swap his eight-bedroom bishop’s house in Liverpool for a two-bedroom workman’s cottage in the West Country. He may write a book, but first “there’ll be a lot of snoring for about six months, and remembering how to be a grandfather”.",News/Politics,"Boris Johnson should be ashamed of Savile slur, says bishop",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/12/boris-johnson-savile-slur-bishop-paul-bayes
2/12/2022,"The United States government used its first trip to the South Pacific by a secretary of state in almost 40 years to warn Russia to back off Ukraine. Antony Blinken told reporters in Fiji he would speak to his Russian counterpart, the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, to advise that the US was prepared for either diplomacy or “aggression” and warned of economic sanctions in the event of an invasion.  “If President (Vladimir) Putin decides to take military action, we will swiftly impose severe economic sanctions in coordination with allies and partners around the globe,” Blinken said. “We will bolster Ukraine’s ability to defend itself, we will reinforce our allies on the eastern flank of Nato.” Blinken also made an apparent swipe at China, whose influence has grown in the Pacific region in the past few decades and pushed for a “a free and open Indo-Pacific”. “Pacific Islanders are proud. They believe that no matter their size, they alone should be able to choose their path, whether that’s how they manage their natural resources, or who they partner with. We share that belief. And we think the world is a more secure and prosperous place when core international principles like that are respected.” Blinken touched down in Fiji on Saturday for a whirlwind trip, lasting just over eight hours, the first secretary of state to visit Fiji in 37 years. He was on his way back from Australia, where he attended the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad, a security partnership between the US, India, Japan and Australia. Blinken returns to the US via Hawaii which he will also visit for eight hours. Fiji, with a population of just under a million, is located at the centre of the Pacific, making it the hub of travel and economic activity. Home to the headquarters of the Pacific Islands Forum, Fiji holds close diplomatic relations with Australia and New Zealand, who are its major trading partners. Over the past 15 years, while under sanctions by its western allies, the Fijian government established closer relations with China. Blinken’s trip was widely seen as the US trying to bolster support in the contest for influence between the US and China in the Pacific. Chinese presence in the Pacific Islands has increased significantly since 2006 to make them the third largest donor to the region. According to Lowy Institute research, foreign aid from Beijing was worth US $1.5bn and only 8% of all foreign aid to the Pacific between 2011 and 2017. However, Chinese concessional loans tend to be for the large infrastructure projects in the islands. Many Pacific islands now trade more with China than they do with Australia. Blinken announced the next US embassy in the region would open soon in Solomon Islands, whose trade with China accounts for almost half of all its trade. Promising more innovative engagement in the Pacific in Climate Change and trade, Blinken said the US would deepen its relationship with Asean, Apec and the Pacific Islands Forum, alluding to bringing the strength of its partnerships in other regions of the world. “The United States is increasingly speaking with one voice with our Nato allies and our G7 partners, when it comes to Indo Pacific matters, you can see the strength of that commitment to the Indo Pacific throughout the past year.” Pushing that it was part of the Pacific, Blinken pointed to the US’s history in the region as a sign of its closeness to it. “It was here on these beaches that Americans shared some of the hardest fought battles in the second world war,” he said. Blinken, who met 18 Pacific Island leaders virtually in Nadi, announced the US government’s new Indo-Pacific engagement strategy, calling the region “vital to our own prosperity, our own progress”. A key way that the US is trying to establish itself as the diplomatic partner of choice for Fiji is through commitments on the climate crisis, which poses an existential threat for Pacific nations. Blinken announced increasing United States AID (USAI) Climate Change funding for the Pacific saying a substantial portion of its $150bn commitment announced at Cop26 would be for the islands. Further, the US government announced the Pacific Island countries were “prime candidates for the President’s Emergency Plan for Adaptation and Resilience or PREPARE initiative.” Blinken said USAID would help Pacific Island organisations get accredited to manage climate financing for regional projects. “The thread that runs through all of our engagements with Fiji is that we’re working together in a spirit of partnership in a spirit of respect, to tackle shared challenges, to build upon shared opportunities to deliver concrete results for people on the issues that actually affect their lives. And that’s the approach behind our Indo Pacific strategy as a whole.”",News/World news,Ukraine: Blinken warns Russia US is prepared for ‘aggression’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/12/ukraine-blinken-warns-russia
2/12/2022,"Thousands of lives could be saved if more people knew the early symptoms of a heart attack, the NHS has said as it launched a campaign urging people to call 999 earlier. Research by NHS England found three in four people confused a heart attack, which has symptoms that do not always feel severe, with a cardiac arrest.  “Sadly, cardiovascular disease causes a quarter of all deaths across the country and we have identified this as the single biggest area where we can save lives over the next decade,” said Stephen Powis, NHS medical director. The new Help Us Help You drive encourages people to call 999 earlier and educates people about symptoms such as sweating, uneasiness and chest tightness. Only 41% of 2,022 people polled knew sweating is a heart-attack symptom. That dropped to just 27% of people who knew feeling weak, lightheaded or generally uneasy are symptoms. Powis continued: “It can be easy to dismiss early symptoms as they don’t always feel severe, but it is never too early to dial 999 in this circumstance – and the faster you act, the better the chance of a full recovery.” England has more than 80,000 hospital admissions for heart attacks a year. The survival rate, of seven in 10 people, rises to nine in 10 for those who get early hospital treatment. The campaign is backed by celebrities including Sky Sports presenter Peter Dale and actor and director Richard Wilson, who have both experienced heart attacks. “I had no idea that I was experiencing symptoms of a heart attack,” said Dale, who was 36. “On the morning of the attack, I went home after playing football thinking I had indigestion – I just didn’t feel quite right and both of my arms started to feel numb.” Dale said he managed to text his mum, who called an ambulance, and paramedics told him it was a heart attack. “People need to be aware of the symptoms – it’s not a case of clutching your chest and falling to the ground. Early signs aren’t always severe but if you experience any symptoms, call 999,” Dale said. “Acting quickly saved my life.” In the 1960s, more than seven in 10 heart attacks in the UK were fatal. Now, at least 7 in 10 people survive, with 1.1 million survivors living in England. Wilson, 85, said his heart attack exerted a long-term toll. “I got more tired, I’m able to walk around less and my memory has suffered as well. The scariest part is that at the time I did not know enough about heart attacks or heart health,” he said. According to the NHS, a heart attack is when blood supply to the heart is blocked, dangerously starving the body of oxygen, but people are often conscious and breathing. A cardiac arrest – which can be provoked by a heart attack – is when the heart stops suddenly, with people losing consciousness and often dying in minutes without treatment. Wilson added: “I’d advise everyone, especially those aged 50 and over, to look up the symptoms of a heart attack and if you suspect you have any of these to call 999 immediately.”",News/Society,NHS urges people to learn early signs of a heart attack ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/12/early-signs-of-heart-attack-nhs
2/12/2022,"Britain’s empty high street shops and derelict department stores should be transformed into artists’ studios and galleries to bring life back to city centres, according to the outgoing director of one of the country’s leading art spaces. With artists being pushed out of city centres by soaring rents and living costs, galleries under financial pressure and high streets struggling, Iwona Blazwick, who has led Whitechapel Gallery for more than 20 years, called on local authorities to offer the spaces at reduced rents to artists. This comes as the London gallery prepares to launch an exhibition dedicated to the subject of the artist’s studio – Blazwick’s last as director.  “It’s an interesting moment because it’s a question of whether people will want to go back to working in the city; we’ve seen one high street shop after another not surviving. High streets are struggling, whole department stores have disappeared. So what is the future for those spaces?” she said. “And to me, there is an immediate tenancy standing right there, which is the artists’. They’re guaranteed, they’re going to bring with them a whole way of life, which brings a neighbourhood back into viability and into being a great place to live and work.” Department stores have taken a big hit in recent years, while the move to online shopping has left many high street stalwarts struggling. In 2016 British Home Stores closed all its UK branches; two years later, House of Fraser went into administration; Debenhams closed 118 stores after Covid hit, and John Lewis announced several closures too. Rather than turning empty buildings into luxury apartments, Blazwick said, there is an opportunity to take inspiration from Damien Hirst, who in 1988, along with 15 other art students, “seized the moment” of a recession to stage the exhibition Freeze by opening up unused spaces to artists. Freeze, in a Docklands warehouse, served as a launchpad for the Young British Artists (YBAs), and gave rise to a whole new art scene. Blazwick, who in 1992 mounted Hirst’s first major solo show at a public gallery and who has been credited with discovering the artist, said there was “huge scope” for empty shops and properties to fill the gaps by being turned into galleries as Hirst did with Freeze. “That’s exactly what they did. They seized that moment of a recession and took over empty shops and properties and an entire art scene was born. There is that potential now.” Such an initiative could harness and nurture creativity of people in rural and urban areas, she said. “We are in a post-industrial future and what we need is young people with ideas. To be creative is now the way of shaping the future and the economy.” In London, some former factories are protected by studio associations as artists’ spaces, but long-term leases make it “harder and harder” for young artists to find affordable spaces in the capital, she said, which is why so many are moving to seaside destinations such as Whitstable, Folkestone and Hastings. When artists get pushed out of a city, she said, “that’s when the energy leaves the city.” She added: “And as we suppress it and turn one space after another into so-called luxury flats, that is going to be destroyed. So we do have a mission here to try and persuade local authorities and developers that it has to be an intrinsic part of city planning.” With art institutions facing “a very challenging financial horizon”, Blazwick said that they were likely to mount fewer exhibitions and to keep those that they do put on running for longer. “Where then is the platform for emerging arts or new ideas or unestablished figures?” London, she said, was the “de facto centre of the art world”, but would lose that status if there were no studio spaces, galleries exhibiting emerging artists, or reduced art school funding: “All of that is a complex but fragile ecosystem and if we fail to invest in that, we do so at our peril. It will become a less liveable and less significant capital.” She praised the work of artist Tracey Emin who plans to create a “revolutionary” art school in her home town of Margate, along with 30 studios for art students as well as an artist’s residency programme. A Century of the Artist’s Studio 1920-2020, which opens at Whitechapel on 24 February, features more than 100 works by more than 80 artists and collectives including Francis Bacon, Louise Bourgeois, Barbara Hepworth, Pablo Picasso, Kerry James Marshall, Andy Warhol and Lisa Brice. Studios, Blazwick said, act as vital “test sites” for artists, as well as places to create, take refuge and to perform. Quoting Virginia Woolf’s A Room of One’s Own, she said the studio was a place “where you can think, research, refine, try out, fail, try again, succeed.” As well as paintings, sculptures and films documenting artists’ studios there will also be recreations of the three-dimensional surroundings of various artists’ spaces in a series of studio corners, including Warhol’s Silver Factory in New York and Kurt Schwitters’ living sculpture, the Merzbau in Hanover, which was destroyed in a British air raid in 1943. Antony Gormley, who features in the exhibition, said that affordable studios were “essential” for young and emerging artists, arguing that these spaces should be required as part of planning applications. “Local councils and developers should make it their duty to support creative people,” he said. “Artists are the ultimate doers and responders. They do things in their own way and recognise what has been done by others to make neighbourhoods lively, friendly and fun.”",News/Cities,"Empty shops could be studios for next Bacon or Hirst, says leading curator",https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2022/feb/12/empty-shops-artist-studios-whitechapel-gallery-director
2/12/2022,"Eventually every classic TV show will get a reboot (what price Press Gang: The Substack Years?). Last year saw Don Cheadle narrate a reworking of The Wonder Years. A young Cheadle appeared in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air back in 1990. Coming next week to Peacock/Now is a dramatic retelling of the sitcom myth: Bel-Air sees newcomer Jabari Banks arrive from west Philadelphia to sit on the Fresh throne previously occupied by Will Smith.  The pilot of the original show was written by then husband and wife duo Andy and Susan Borowitz. Andy has claimed that the Fresh Prince’s cousin Carlton (he of the dance) was named after his college friend, the writer Carlton Cuse. Carlton Cuse is a prolific screenwriter, director and producer who created Nash Bridges (itself rebooted briefly last year), and Bates Motel (a Psycho reinterpretation). He was also one of the writers on supernatural survivor series Lost. Lost co-creator JJ Abrams made his film directing debut with the third round of Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible series, itself a kind of reboot. Back in 2004, shortly before Cruise jumped on Oprah’s couch, he starred in Michael Mann’s excellent hitman thriller Collateral, alongside Jamie Foxx (who later dated Katie Holmes, subject of the couch incident) and Jada Pinkett Smith, underrated but excellent as (spoiler alert!) one of Cruise’s targets. Matrix star Jada is married to Will Smith, although, as their compelling confessional chat on her web show Red Table Talk attests, there have been bumps along the way. Never not busy – and Oscar-tipped for King Richard – Will also helped to develop the new Bel-Air adventures. Whether the beloved, oft-parodied theme tune returns in some shape or form, remains to be seen. Watch The new Bel-Air began as a three-and-a-half-minute fan film made by Morgan Cooper in 2019, which picked up several million views on YouTube.

2/12/2022,"There’s a difficult balance in dance between being yourself on stage, making an impact with the weight of your presence (which is why people want to watch you in the first place) and presenting the choreography. Pina Bausch’s Kontakthof, about life, love and the ongoing need for contact, was made in 1978, when the choreographer was developing her unique ideas about Tanztheater. It was created with a group of fiercely individual dancers, who brought their own personalities to the piece, and then deepened by the performers she nurtured and treasured down the years.  It has also been performed by non-dancers – old and young – who had a different authenticity. Now it’s back, in the hands and bodies of a new, young cast who are striving to burrow inside its sad, strange, troubling encounters between the sexes. The society depicted to a soundtrack of songs from the 1920s and 30s, with its formal dances and incongruous nature film show, belonged to Bausch’s parents’ world. At first, this different generation struggle to find their way inside its gestures, its tone – all those silk dresses being twitched by anxious hands, hair being smoothed, teeth being shown. As the three-hour piece progresses, though, the universality of its rituals, the pain and hope underlying the dances, pierces through. The dancers relax, letting their own lives illuminate Bausch’s steps. It isn’t quite as it was, but it is still utterly engrossing. The dancers are undoubtedly the best thing about 100% Cuban, Carlos Acosta’s latest mixed programme for his Cuban-based company Acosta Danza. They have talent, personality and enthusiasm that beams off the stage. It is a pleasure to spend a couple of hours in their company. The problem they face is that Acosta’s clear eye for potential in a performer is patchier when it comes to choosing works in which they can flourish. Hybrid (by Norge Cedeño and Thais Suárez) is a messy misunderstanding of the myth of Sisyphus, enlivened only by the energy of the dancers, and Impronta (by Maria Rovira) fails to make the most of the talent of Zeleidy Crespo, who can do anything asked of her but is here asked only dull questions. Liberto, a duet about a freed slave, in which Crespo stars alongside Mario Sergio Elias, pushes her into incredible shapes and poses, and company dancer Raúl Reinoso has some good ideas, but its hectic intensity never quite gets anywhere. De Punta a Cabo, choreographed by Alexis Fernández (Maca) and Yaday Ponce, which sets the dancers against a film of them on Havana’s Malecón, the sea wall where young people hang out and dream, makes a lively ending to an evening, but its mix of pointe shoes and trainers feels a little forced. Thank goodness, then, for Pontus Lidberg, whose sophisticated Paysage, Soudain, la nuit has a sumptuous score by Leo Brouwer and Stefan Levin and a glorious setting of a line of corn, courtesy of Elizabet Cerviño. It lets the dancers shine, their feet slipping and sliding, their arms a tapestry of gesture, the movement seemingly simple but always enticing.

2/12/2022,"Whatever the outcome of Sunday morning’s giant slalom race at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, one record is sure to be set. Jamaica will be represented in Alpine skiing for the first time. Benjamin Alexander, a 38-year-old from Northampton, will be at the starting gate, becoming one of only 15 athletes to represent Jamaica at the Winter Olympics, and following in the footsteps of the 1988 bobsleigh team immortalised in the movie Cool Runnings.  Alexander recently told CNN that when he started to learn to ski “being the only black representative in the group, but on top of that being of Jamaican heritage, people kept throwing sideways jokes about Cool Runnings”. Dudley “Tal” Stokes, a member of that famous bobsleigh team, is now one of Alexander’s mentors. Having got the bug for skiing, he went on to attend the Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics as a spectator and noted that despite their strong Summer Games presence, Jamaica only sent three athletes to South Korea that year. He began to wonder if it was possible for him to qualify. “I thought the most likely outcome was death or at least a serious injury.” The actual outcome was that alongside Jazmine Fenlator-Victorian he carried Jamaica’s flag into the Bird’s Nest Stadium in Beijing for the opening ceremony of the 2022 Games. Armstrong only started skiing in 2015, when he was DJing at the top of a Canadian mountain and gave it a go. Since deciding to attempt to reach the Olympics he has taken it much more seriously, training with multiple coaches including the American former skier Gordon Gray, who at one point told Armstrong his technique was atrocious, “the worst I’ve ever seen”. The child of a Jamaican father and an English mother, Alexander had a working-class upbringing in Wellingborough outside Northampton, and says nobody in his immediate family had ever skied before. He secured qualification by finishing seventh in the giant slalom at the Cape Verde National Ski Championships in Liechtenstein in January this year. “I would never have embarked on this mission had I not thought that was possible,” he says. He’s keen to take up a role as an ambassador for the sport – and for having fun on the slopes. In a recent interview with his hometown BBC Radio Northampton, he said: “I hope to inspire people who have taken a bit of joy out of my story to go to Milton Keynes, to the Snozone, or go on holiday to the Alps and give it a shot. “There’s a place for everyone and if I can get from zero to Olympian in six years, everyone can go from zero to having fun in a much shorter period of time.” As for his ambition on what he expects to be a “pinch-me moment” as he prepares to compete at the Olympics: survival. Having never been on the world stage, he is conscious he is racing against people who have huge budgets and many years of experience. “It’s going to be completely surreal,” he says. “Sometimes you just have to keep going over the basics or you’ll get overwhelmed by the emotions of the competition.”",Sport/Sport,"Benjamin Alexander, Jamaica’s unlikely skier out to be an inspiration",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/12/its-surreal-benjamin-alexander-the-dj-turned-jamaican-skiing-sensation
2/12/2022," In returning to the intrinsic pleasures of physical objects, will we ever again covet the CD as miniature treasury? The Italian conductor Giovanni Antonini is working hard to make us. Now on Volume 11, Au goût parisien, of the Haydn2032 series (Alpha Classics) – shared between Il Giardino Armonico and the Basel Chamber Orchestra – he is recording all Haydn’s 107 symphonies in time for the composer’s 300th anniversary.  This latest volume, with the Basel players sizzling and exuberant, includes two of the “Paris” symphonies, Nos 82 in C, “The Bear” – characterised by explosive “bagpipe” drones in the finale – and No 87 in A, as well as No 24 in D and No 2 in C. This epic project will form a vital legacy: brilliant performances, historically informed. The handsome and informative 50-page booklet provides a list of the make and date of all the instruments played. In collaboration with the Magnum agency, each themed volume features a different photographer. You can catch up with a newly available box set of Volumes 1 to 10. Haydn brings joy and variety as no other.  The Scottish composer Martin Suckling (b.1981) waits till his household is asleep, then starts work. The Tuning (Delphian) explores the hours of darkness, including a nocturne and a lullaby, expertly performed by principal players of Aurora Orchestra, the mezzo soprano Marta Fontanals-Simmons and the pianist Christopher Glynn. The songs of the title work move from a contemplation of death to the quietly lyrical Two Spells for Sleeping. A string quintet, Emily’s Electrical Absence, pays turbulent but tender homage to Schubert and Emily Dickinson, with the poet Frances Leviston speaking her own texts between movements. Suckling’s chamber music, unsettling and stirring, deftly captures night’s hauntings.  Time to reevaluate the composer Alan Bush (1900-95), long ostracised in British musical circles for his refusal to quell his pro-Soviet political beliefs that surfaced in choruses and songs for workers’ choirs, as well as four operas premiered in East Germany.
