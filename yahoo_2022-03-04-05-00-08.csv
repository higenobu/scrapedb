""Not many nations would be able to push back,"" Nicolas Chaillan told Fox News. ""I don't even think the United States would be able to push back if tomorrow Russia and China decide to come together against us."" ""I think it would be very difficult for us to be able to even have a fighting chance, let alone a nation like Ukraine,"" he added. Russia entered its eighth day of fighting after invading Ukraine on Feb. 24. Western intelligence predicted the superpower would quickly sweep through its neighbor, but Ukraine still controls its capital, Kyiv. PENTAGON POSTPONES ICBM TEST AMID TENSIONS WITH RUSSIA Chaillan said ""this is not the full force of the Russian capabilities,"" which he called ""tremendous."" ""They have not used the most innovative capabilities yet,"" Chaillan told Fox News. ""They're focusing on the more traditional warfighting capabilities."" ""We have to be cautious. I always remind people that [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin is not stupid,"" Chaillan said. ""We may not yet understand what his plan was all along."" But the former Pentagon official said he's ""way more scared about China."" Chaillan said it would be ""game changing"" if China provided Russia with advanced technologies. Chaillan believes China would first give Russia cyber offense capabilities. ""You also have some AI and machine learning capabilities that could be used to look at satellite imagery and find where troops are located, be able to do better real-time analysis of what's going on on the ground,"" Chaillan said. The former Pentagon official said he wouldn’t be surprised if China was already sharing data with Russia. But he warned of possible repercussions if the U.S. or other Western nations offered the same support to Ukraine. ""We have to be very careful,"" Chaillan told Fox News. ""If we start providing cyber offensive capabilities, nothing stops Russia from fighting back and going after our critical infrastructure."" The International Institute for Strategic Studies placed the U.S. as the lone country in its top tier when assessing 15 nations' cyber power. China and Russia were ranked in the second tier, along with Western countries like France and the United Kingdom. But Chaillan said the cyber defense for critical infrastructure, like power and water systems, is ""at the kindergarten level."" ""It would be very impactful to U.S. citizens if something were to happen,"" Chaillan said. ""They could potentially take down the grid for weeks, if not months.""",World/Fox News,"US doesn't stand 'a fighting chance' if Russia and China combine cyber tech, former Pentagon official says",https://news.yahoo.com/us-doesn-apos-t-stand-165231646.html
3/4/2022,"A high-ranking Russian army leader has been killed during fighting in Ukraine, in what experts say will be a bitter blow for Vladimir Putin. Andrei Sukhovetsky was the commanding general of the Russian 7th Airborne Division and a deputy commander of the 41st Combined Arms Army, and by far the most senior Russian figure to have died in the conflict so far. Russian leader Vladimir Putin confirmed that a general had been killed in a speech updating the Russian people on the progress of the conflict, eight days into the deadly invasion. Maj Gen Sukhovetsky’s death, which was confirmed by a local officers’ organisation in the Krasnodar region in southern Russia, will be seen as another sign Mr Putin’s war effort is not going to plan. He was a respected paratrooper, practised in missions in “hostile territory”, and reportedly had been decorated for his role in the annexation of Crimea. The circumstances of the death were not immediately clear but many reports said he was killed by a sniper. Sergey Chipilev, a deputy of the Combat Brotherhood Russian veterans group, wrote on social media: “With great pain, we learned the tragic news of the death of our friend, Major General Andrey Sukhovetsky, on the territory of Ukraine during the special operation. We express our deepest condolences to his family.” Russian newspaper Pravda, which also reported his death, said Mr Sukhovetsky graduated from the Ryazan Higher Airborne Command School in 1995, having started as a platoon commander before rising to chief of staff of the Guards airborne assault unit. Christo Grozev, executive director of investigative journalism website Bellingcat, tweeted that confirmation of his death would be a “major demotivator” for the Russian army. Maj Gen Sukhovetsky, 47, had steadily risen through the military ranks to take a series of leadership positions, and he took part in Russia’s military campaign in Syria. Russia claims 498 of its soldiers have been killed in Ukraine and another 1,597 have been wounded. However, British officials say the actual number of those killed and wounded will almost certainly be considerably higher and will continue to rise. Help the children of Ukraine by donating to our Refugees Welcome campaign The UN human rights office says at least 227 civilians have been killed and 525 wounded in Ukraine since the start of the invasion a week ago. Ukraine’s state emergency service has said more than 2,000 civilians have died. A member of Ukraine’s delegation sent to talks with the Russians said both sides had agreed to establish corridors for civilians to safely leave combat zones. The corridors will include cease-fires along the path, said Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to president Volodymyr Zelensky. Humanitarian supplies could be delivered though the corridors, which were the Ukrainians’ main demand heading into their second round of negotiations in Belarus.Mr Putin also announced the safe zones. The Independent has a proud history of campaigning for the rights of the most vulnerable, and we first ran our Refugees Welcome campaign during the war in Syria in 2015.

3/4/2022,"SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) — They had barely a week to prepare — getting medical screenings, making sure bills would be paid, arranging for relatives to care for children and pets — before marching with rucksacks and rifles onto a plane bound for Germany. “It’s been very hectic and stressful, but overall it’s worked out,” Army Staff Sgt. Ricora Jackson said Wednesday as she waited with dozens of fellow soldiers to board a chartered flight at Hunter Army Airfield in Savannah. They're among 3,800 troops from the 1st Armored Brigade of the Army's 3rd Infantry Division, based at nearby Fort Stewart in southeast Georgia, ordered to deploy quickly and bolster U.S. forces in Europe after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In all, the Pentagon has ordered about 12,000 service members from various U.S. bases to Europe, with a couple of thousand more already stationed abroad shifting to other European countries. The soldiers' mission overseas is to train alongside military units of NATO allies in a display of force aimed at deterring further aggression by Russia. It's not that different from the role the brigade played last year during a scheduled rotation in South Korea. But Jackson, a 22-year-old tank gunner from Pensacola, Florida, said this deployment feels different. Although U.S. forces aren't intervening in Ukraine, that war has increased tensions in neighboring NATO countries. “I’m a little nervous, but it’s OK,"" Jackson said. Maj. Gen. Charles Costanza, the 3rd Infantry's commander, said the rapid deployment has had a mixed impact on morale within the brigade, which had been in the midst of training. Younger, single soldiers, he said, have been excited to embark on their first mission overseas. But more experienced soldiers with families, used to a routine deployment calendar with plenty of time to prepare, have felt the disruption more. “They were in the field shooting gunnery when we got the official word that it was time for them to go,” Costanza said. ""You have a lot of them married, or with a new baby, and it's their first time to really do a no-notice deployment.” Costanza said soldiers and their families were told to expect the deployment to last six months, which could be extended — or perhaps shortened — depending on developments in Ukraine. “There is no intent to have any U.S. service member fight in Ukraine,"" Costanza said. ""And they know that.” For Sgt. 1st Class Joshua Cooner, departing for Germany means leaving his three daughters — ages 7, 5 and 3 — just a few months after he returned home from South Korea. A 35-year-old tank crewman and platoon leader from Fort Myers, Florida, Cooner said he's trying to keep the 15 soldiers under his command focused on the day-to-day training mission without dwelling on the invasion and war that prompted it. “Something I’ve preached to my soldiers about, when we talk about stress and being able to control stress, is to focus on the things that are in our sphere of control,"" Cooner said. Sgt. 1st Class Crystal Allen, who works in logistics, and her husband, a soldier assigned to a different battalion in the 1st Brigade, were also leaving two children at home. The married soldiers' son and daughter had been picked up by Allen's mother to stay with her in Kentucky while their parents deployed. “I’m very honest with the kids and I don’t lie,"" said Allen, 35. ""I tell them exactly what I’m going over to do and they acknowledge it. I tell them where I’m going. And I pitch it to them like, 'Hey, you get to go stay with Nanny for a little bit.' And that’s good enough for them.” Likewise, Cpl. Christian Morris' in-laws were looking after two dogs belonging to him and his wife, an Army medic who's also headed to Germany. The 21-year-old soldier from Bend, Oregon, who serves in a supply unit, said he'll be glad to have his spouse nearby, though they won't be living together while deployed. “It’ll just be, 'Hey, you want to go grab something to eat if we have the chance?'"" Morris said. “That’ll be about the most interaction we’ll be realistically allowed to have.”",World/Associated Press,'Very hectic': US troops rush to Europe amid war in Ukraine,https://news.yahoo.com/very-hectic-us-troops-rush-234228554.html
