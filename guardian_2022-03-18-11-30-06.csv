3/18/2022,"Thousands of flood-affected residents in northern New South Wales could spend days without mobile reception after what federal Labor MP Justine Elliot described as “the deliberate burning” of a Telstra 5G tower. New South Wales police could not yet say whether the fire at the Mullumbimby phone tower was deliberately lit, but confirmed an investigation was under way into its cause and that a crime scene had been established. Elliot, the member for Richmond, said she was “disgusted by the deliberate burning” of the tower. Please find my statement on vandals burning the Telstra tower in Mullumbimby. pic.twitter.com/tcqrV6rkIn “The authorities have advised me that this fire was deliberately lit and a criminal investigation is underway,” Elliott said in a statement shared via her Twitter account. “We have just seen the effects of a lack of communication through an emergency – when people couldn’t use their phones and were stranded without rescue,” she said in a statement. “As a result of these actions, people right now cannot use their phones around Mullumbimby … this places lives at risk and will significantly set back our recovery.” Telstra said the fire appeared to be deliberately lit, with a spokesperson describing it as a “unnecessary, dangerous and selfish act of vandalism”. The site is Telstra’s only telecommunications tower in greater Mullumbimby, meaning thousands of residents would be without mobile coverage as flood recovery efforts continued. Telstra’s establishment of its first 5G tower in Mullumbimby last year sparked backlash from some residents, with conspiracy theorists claiming 5G’s “electromagnetic energy” harmed babies and was related to the spread of Covid. Emergency services were called to the scene at about 3am on Friday following reports that the top of the tower was alight. Fire and Rescue NSW attended a short time later and extinguished the blaze. Technicians were working to assess the damage. Telstra’s regional general manager, Mike Marom, said the fire had made a difficult time for Mullumbimby “much harder”. “At a time like this, when communications are so crucial to flood recovery, to have our mobile site damaged and critical telecommunications taken out is reprehensible,” he said. Marom said it could take several days for some mobile coverage to be re-established in the town. “We’re working on bringing a temporary mobile service in to Mullumbimby but, with a number of our temporary mobile services already deployed elsewhere across the NSW and Queensland flood zones, we’re having to balance the need for mobile connectivity in a number of places at the same time,” he said. He said Telstra was assisting NSW police with its investigation and had crews on site to assess the damage.",News/Australia news,‘Dangerous’: 5G tower fire in flood-hit Mullumbimby under NSW police investigation,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/18/dangerous-5g-tower-fire-in-flood-hit-mullumbimby-under-nsw-police-investigation
3/18/2022,"Australia’s consumer watchdog is taking Meta to court, alleging the company “aided and abetted” celebrity scam ads on Facebook that have cost some Australians hundreds of thousands of dollars. The ads, which include the promotion of investment in cryptocurrency, have plagued the platform since 2020. Each ad depicts an image of a prominent Australian such as David Koch, Dick Smith or Andrew Forrest, claiming to have made it big with the investments in a fake news article that directs people to the scam investment website. A previous Guardian Australia investigation found the sites were registered to addresses in Russia, with others in Ukraine. Meta has struggled to keep the ads off its site, with the scammers frequently changing the URLs for the scam sites and the text of the ads to escape Facebook’s ad filtering. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said Meta has not done enough to stop these ads. It has taken the company to the federal court for engaging in allegedly false, misleading or deceptive conduct in publishing the ads, and aiding and abetting the false conduct by the advertisers. “The essence of our case is that Meta is responsible for these ads that it publishes on its platform,” the ACCC chair, Rod Sims, said. “It is a key part of Meta’s business to enable advertisers to target users who are most likely to click on the link in an ad to visit the ad’s landing page, using Facebook algorithms. Those visits to landing pages from ads generate substantial revenue for Facebook.” Smith, who had complained to Meta about the ads in 2020, welcomed the legal action. “I just don’t have the deep pockets. I knew that if I tried to take Facebook on, basically that I would just end up spending a fortune and they would just throw money at it,” he told Guardian Australia. “I totally support [the ACCC action] and I’m hoping that [it] is going to get Facebook to change its checking procedure so they don’t just run scam ads without any checking.” The ACCC says Meta did not take sufficient steps to stop the issue, despite Smith, Forrest and others featured in the ads complaining about it. “We allege that the technology of Meta enabled these ads to be targeted to users most likely to engage with the ads, that Meta assured its users it would detect and prevent spam and promote safety on Facebook, but it failed to prevent the publication of other similar celebrity endorsement cryptocurrency scam ads on its pages or warn users,” Sims said. “Meta should have been doing more to detect and then remove false or misleading ads on Facebook, to prevent consumers from falling victim to ruthless scammers.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The ACCC will seek injunctions, penalties and costs among the orders sought. A spokesperson for Meta said the company intended to defend the proceedings but could not comment on the specific claims while it was before the court. “We don’t want ads seeking to scam people out of money or mislead people on Facebook – they violate our policies and are not good for our community. We use technology to detect and block scam ads and work to get ahead of scammers’ attempts to evade our detection systems. We’ve cooperated with the ACCC’s investigation into this matter to date.” The company removed 1.7bn fake accounts and 1.2bn pieces of spam content between October to December last year – more than 99.9% and 99.6% respectively of each were removed before they were reported. Meta also took legal action in 2020 against LeadCloak, a company providing software to get around Facebook’s ad detection system. The scam has likely raked in millions from unsuspecting people. One 77-year-old grandmother lost $80,000 in the investment, while the ACCC has said another person lost $650,000 through the scam. Smith said Facebook should be required to have human intervention to check ads before they run, and said his image was still being used in the scam ads as recently as a month ago. Forrest has launched criminal proceedings against Meta over the ads in Australia as well as a civil suit in the United States.",News/Technology,ACCC takes Meta to court over Facebook scam ads depicting Australian identities,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/18/accc-takes-meta-to-court-over-facebook-scam-ads-depicting-australian-identities
3/18/2022,"Rafael Nadal quelled the challenge of a typically combustible Nick Kyrgios to reach the BNP Paribas Open semi-finals with a hard-fought 7-6 (7-0), 5-7, 6-4 win at the Indian Wells Masters tournament. Nadal, the world No 4, kept his cool in the heat of the Californian desert to advance to the semis of the event regarded as the “fifth grand slam”. Meanwhile, Kyrgios struggled to control his temper and allowed repeated interruptions from the crowd to get under his skin. Kyrgios’s concentration was disrupted on several occasions, and he became visibly and audibly riled by the noise from the stands. At one point, the Australian dragged the watching Hollywood actor Ben Stiller into the drama, pointing at the Zoolander star and rebuking a member of the crowd: “Do I tell him how to act?”. Soon after, having being broken in the seventh game of the third set, Kyrgios’s temper flared again and at the change of ends he pleaded with the chair umpire, Carlos Bernardes, to do more to keep the boisterous crowd quiet during points. “How long you going to let that shit go on for?” Kyrgios said. “How long bro? How long? If you did something about it before now it wouldn’t have happened. Look at the score, look at it. Over and over and over again they’re doing it. Unbelievable job controlling the crowd.” From that point on, there was no looking back for Nadal as he wrapped up victory and booked a place in the semis against the winner of the last-eight clash between British No 1 Cam Norrie and Carlos Alcaraz of Spain. Kyrgios, the world No 132 and needing a wildcard to enter, made a mockery of his lowly ranking from early, breaking Nadal first and extending his run to 30 straight service holds at the tournament. The 26-year-old fumed as he missed his chance to serve out the first set, smashing two rackets – handing the second to a child in the crowd. After forcing a tiebreak, he lost it to love, handing Nadal the set with a code violation. Kyrgios snapped back at a crowd member as he waited for quiet on his serve, drawing the point penalty. “When you do that I need to penalise you because it’s too loud,” umpire Bernardes told Kyrgios, who shook his head as he replied “unbelievable”. The circus atmosphere required another intervention from Bernardes, who leaned out of his chair to address one man, saying: “There are 10,000 people who want to watch tennis here and you’re the only one who wants to scream like crazy. Please.” On the court, Kyrgios gathered his composure, closing out service games and disguised drop shots as he led 6-5. At change of ends, he kept engaging Bernardes on the raucous crowd, saying: “You see how it affects the players? You don’t protect the players from any of that stuff.” After levelling his head, he also levelled the match with another piece of magic, slipping on his way to reach a drop shot before scrambling an overhead to win the second set. The momentum was with Kyrgios in the third, with Nadal holding serve with uncharacteristic sloppiness in the opening games. But that all changed as the Australian’s head appeared turned by the crowd during the final games. Nadal’s victory was his 19th in succession this year, a run which has brought ATP titles in Melbourne and Acapulco and a record-breaking 21st slam at the Australian Open. While Kyrgios fell short against Nadal, he will leap in the rankings after a productive tournament, projected to be world No 101 by week’s end. Kyrgios, a wildcard entry, beat Sebastian Baez, Federico Delbonis and world No 8 Casper Ruud en route to the quarter-finals, all in straight sets, also benefitting from a walkover from Janek Sinner.",Sport/Sport,Rafael Nadal keeps cool to down combustible Kyrgios in Indian Wells quarter-finals,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/18/rafael-nadal-keeps-cool-to-down-combustible-kyrgios-in-indian-wells-quarter-finals
