5/17/2022,"As details of the Buffalo mass shooting emerged over the weekend, much of the media focussed on the shooter’s self-stated motivation: his racist belief that white Americans are being deliberately replaced through immigration in a “great replacement” theory. Over at Fox News, however, there was barely any mention of the white gunman’s alleged reasoning for opening fire at a supermarket, killing 10 people and wounding three more, in a predominantly Black area. The absence of coverage of the motive was revealing, given Fox News’s most popular host, Tucker Carlson, has pushed the concept of replacement theory in more than 400 of his shows – and has arguably done more than anyone in the US to popularize the racist conspiracy. Fox News, according to Oliver Darcy, a media correspondent for CNN, “largely ignored” the fact that the shooter had been inspired by replacement theory. Darcy searched transcripts from Fox News’s shows, and found one brief mention, by Fox News anchor Eric Shawn. As Americans absorbed news of the shooting and struggled to understand why it had happened, it seemed a glaring thing for the network to disregard. But given Carlson and his colleagues’ promotion of the theory, which has been unchecked by Fox News’s top executives, experts see the network as being left in a bind. “What can they say?” said Matt Gertz, senior fellow at Media Matters for America, a watchdog of rightwing media. “There’s no way for anyone at Fox News to really issue a convincing and compelling, forthright denunciation of great replacement theory, because it’s being discussed on the network’s primetime hour on a near constant basis.” Great replacement theory, or white replacement theory, states that a range of liberals, Democrats and Jewish people are working to replace white voters in western countries with non-white people, in an effort to achieve political aims. It is not a new concept. But Carlson has led the charge in reintroducing it to mainstream rightwing thought. In April a New York Times investigation found that in more than 400 hundred of his shows Carlson had advanced the idea that a “cabal of elites want to force demographic change through immigration”. In a monologue on his Monday night show, Carlson did not directly address replacement theory. He claimed the Buffalo shooter’s manifesto was “not recognizably left wing or right-wing: it’s not really political at all”, despite the rambling document referencing a number of right-wing conspiracy theories. Carlson referred to the gunman as “mentally ill” and launched an attack on “professional Democrats” who had “begun a campaign to blame those murders on their political opponents.” In April 2021, after Carlson claimed on his show that Democrats were “diluting” his vote by “importing a brand-new electorate”, the Anti-Defamation League wrote to Fox News to sound the alarm. “Make no mistake: this is dangerous stuff. The ‘great replacement theory’ is a classic white supremacist trope that undergirds the modern white supremacist movement in America,” wrote Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO and national director of the ADL. “It is a concept that is discussed almost daily in online racist fever swamps. It is a notion that fueled the hateful chants of ‘Jews will not replace us!’ in Charlottesville in 2017. And it has lit the fuse in explosive hate crimes, most notably the hate-motivated mass shooting attacks in Pittsburgh, Poway and El Paso, as well as in Christchurch, New Zealand.” The ADL called for Carlson to be fired for his comments, but instead the rightwing host – whose show is the most-watched on cable news – has thrived, and his passion for the topic of replacement has spread to his colleagues. But Carlson is not alone on Fox. Laura Ingraham, who hosts an hour-long show at 10pm, has told her viewers that Democrats “want to replace you, the American voters, with newly amnestied citizens and an ever increasing number of chain migrants”, while Jeanine Pirro claimed on a radio show that liberals were engaged in “a plot to remake America, to replace American citizens with illegals who will vote for the Democrats”. “​​To be clear, Fox News is far from the only place where you might hear such dangerous rhetoric,” wrote Tom Jones, a senior media writer at the Poynter institute. “[But] the size of Fox News’s audience is what is notable. Fox News is the most-watched cable news network, and Carlson’s show is the most-watched on cable news, routinely drawing more than 3 million viewers a night.” Fox News declined to comment when asked if it planned to condemn the idea of white replacement or take action against Carlson. A spokeswoman pointed to examples of Carlson denouncing violence on his show. Fox News was one of six media organizations which the gunman claimed, in his manifesto, were disproportionately influenced by Jewish people. The network’s popularity has given it an outsized influence over the Republican party, an influence and relationship which was revealed recently when leaked text messages from the phone of Mark Meadows, Donald Trump’s former White House chief-of-staff, showed Meadows in frequent communication with Fox News hosts as supporters of Trump besieged the US Capitol on 6 January. It should perhaps be little surprise, then, that Trump-supporting Republican politicians like Elise Stefanik and JD Vance have also embraced replacement theory. “It’s been gradually moving from the fringes into the mainstream,” Philip Gorski, a professor of sociology at Yale, told the Washington Post. “First it was the entertainment wing of the GOP. Now it’s the political wing as well.” The Buffalo shooter did not mention Fox News as an influence on his political beliefs, but said he had been radicalized through the extremist online forum 4chan, where he had found “infographics, shitposts, and memes that the White race is dying out”. From there, the gunman said, he had discovered sources including the neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer. Curiously, the founder of the Daily Stormer has called Tucker Carlson “literally our greatest ally”, and praised the Fox News host in 2021, in the wake of his replacement theory comments. “[Carlson was] dropping the ultimate truth bomb on his audience: Jews aggressively lobby for the same demographic policies in America that they openly declare would destroy their own country,” Anglin wrote. Since the shooting Carlson and his fellow Fox News hosts have justifiably drawn criticism for their promotion of replacement theory. But Gertz said the issue ultimately runs deeper, all the way to the Murdoch family which controls the channel. “Everyone knows the score here,” Gertz said. “Tucker Carlson is doing his job. He is providing the content that the Fox News brass, the Murdochs, want out of their 8pm slot. “If they didn’t want him to do this, they could make him stop – but they’ve decided not to. And they have decided not to do that because he is still profitable for them.”",News/US news,Fox News suddenly goes quiet on ‘great replacement’ theory after Buffalo shooting ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/17/buffalo-shooting-fox-news-tucker-carlson-great-replacement-theory
5/17/2022,"Acalorie is a calorie, right? Fixed and unchanging, like a gram, or a mile? Well … no, not necessarily. You see, what a straightforward calorie count on a restaurant menu or food packet can’t tell you is how your individual body will use those calories. This comes down to multiple factors including genetics, gender, age, hormones, gut microbes, sleep patterns, the time of day we are eating, how active or sedentary we are, our body fat and muscle mass, and – crucially – what sort of food the calorie is in. Our bodies are much better at absorbing the energy from a calorie of low-fibre, processed food (like a potato chip) than they are at taking in calories from whole foods, like an apple. Calories are a measure of the heat (energy) given off when a food is completely burned away in a pressurised bomb calorimeter. “But we don’t eat calories. We eat food,” says Dr Giles Yeo, an obesity researcher at Cambridge University and author of Why Calories Don’t Count. That energy is used differently by different bodies. “On average, in high-income countries, we get 50% of our calories from ultra-processed foods (UPFs),” says Yeo. There is no legally binding or agreed upon definition of UPFs, and according to a 2019 review article in the journal Current Developments in Nutrition, definitions used since 2012 vary hugely. For some food scientists, they are foods which are mainly made from additives of various types; for others, they are foods containing few or no wholefood ingredients, made with ingredients consumers can’t usually buy in shops (such as stabilisers), which are also often fortified and which take the place of freshly made meals or snacks. For still others, they are industrial formulations with five or more ingredients; or foods containing additives designed to mimic unprocessed foods or disguise any undesirable qualities in the finished product. Things can get very confusing: according to one definition, a tin of beans in tomato sauce is ultra-processed, but the same beans, canned in water, are merely moderately or minimally processed. But they aren’t just fried chicken, crisps and ready meals: croissants, hummus, pesto, biscuits, breadsticks, gnocchi, cereal bars, ice-cream, fish fingers and curry paste are all UPFs. And in some UPFs, their original ingredients – whether they’re being processed to be longlife, cheap or just conveniently moreish – become a blank (or bland) canvas for what’s added after. “Ultra-processing strips out flavour in food – just because of the way it’s done – and flavour comes from the holy trinity of sugar, salt, and fat, which you have to add back in,” says Yeo. “So, on average, they are high in sugar, salt and fat, and low in protein and fibre, which makes the food very much more calorically available: you get a lot more out of a calorie in an ultra-processed food.” The energy from 100 calories in a high-fibre food like chickpeas won’t behave in the same way in the body as 100 calories in a low-fibre food, such as an iced bun. The energy from the chickpeas will take longer to be digested, be slower to reach our bloodstream – and, unlike the energy from the ultra-processed iced bun, is far less likely to cause an unwelcome rush of glucose and insulin or be stored as fat. Rather than overall calorie content of foods, the more useful thing to know would be the caloric availability of a food to our individual bodies. But you can’t easily turn that into a neat number on a label or restaurant menu. Those neat numbers come from work by Wilbur Olin Atwater, a chemist born in 1844 in New York. His painstaking, years-long analysis involved vaporising a huge number of foods in ruthlessly efficient bomb calorimeters, which unwittingly resulted in our modern calorie-counting obsession. He calculated that fat gave us nine calories per gram, and carbohydrate and protein four calories each per gram. Once you know how much fat, carbohydrate and protein are in a food, using Atwater’s data, you can figure out how many calories it contains – which is exactly what most food manufacturers – and now many restaurant chefs – have to do. It’s maths, not lab work. It’s alluringly simple, but Atwater’s methods weren’t foolproof, and he probably never intended his data to be used as it is today. “Atwater rounded everything up and took averages – so errors were baked in,” says Yeo. Atwater also lived in a very different food environment and based his averages on diets which were more likely to feature mutton than avocados, and lard rather than olive oil – and, crucially, diets in which UPFs didn’t feature. “Which is where the margin of error begins.” Atwater also misunderstood how many calories a body can gain from protein – for every 100 calories in protein, we can actually only take in 70. “Protein calories are 30% wrong everywhere,” says Yeo, because every time the Atwater data is used the error is repeated. “Carb calories are about 10% wrong for anything with fibre, and 5% wrong for white flour or sugar. Fat is the only one for which the Atwater factors are still accurate. [Food manufacturers] also don’t empirically determine how much protein is in something. It’s estimated. So on top of the baked-in errors, there’s that additional error, too.” A 2021 meta-analysis suggested that diets higher in UPFs weren’t just higher in calories (a diet made up of 75% UPFs contains around 200 more calories per day on average than a diet with 15% UPFs) but, more importantly, were also higher in sugar and lower in fibre and most other micronutrients. “The problem [with UPFs] is we eat too much of them rather than them being dangerous, per se,” says Yeo. Does this mean calorie counts are pointless? Not entirely. Clare Thornton-Wood is registered dietitian and spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association. “In clinical practice, we use calorie calculators to work out how much somebody needs if you’ve got someone in ICU and you’re feeding them on a fluid feed,” she says. “We use calories as a starting point. You might say that the average man needs 2,500 calories and the average woman needs 2,000 – but who is this average man or woman?” “The calculation for how many calories you should be eating a day depends on a billion different things,” says Yeo. Is there any way to work out what any one person needs? “We could, but that would mean sticking you in a chamber calorimeter.” Unfortunately, these are rare, very expensive and mean living in a sealed room for three days, with scientists measuring your every breath, movement, consumption and excretion. There is some data from the Medical Research Council Epidemiology Unit in Cambridge that suggests showing calorie counts in places like coffee shops may reduce the calorie content of purchases by about 8%. “But is that the goal?” asks Yeo. “Are we trying to get people to eat 8% less of everything? You can have a really unhealthy diet, but eat less of everything. Or should we be trying to get people to eat less unhealthy stuff and more healthy stuff? That is where calories are useless. Because calories don’t tell you about the health of the item.” There are, for example, 678 calories in a Pret a Manger hummus salad, 684 in three Mars bars, and 708 in a portion of a Sainsbury’s fish and chips ready meal. These very similar numbers don’t tell us that the salad provides a third of our recommended daily fibre and half our daily fat; that the fish and chips contain almost half our daily salt but also half our daily protein; or that the chocolate bars would bust our sugar allowance. By only looking at calories – as on restaurant menus – we lose other, much more helpful information. “Thinking in calories trains us to view more caloric meals as bad and low-calorie meals as good,” says Virginia Sole-Smith, an anti fat-phobia campaigner, author of The Eating Instinct and Substack anti-diet newsletter Burnt Toast. It reinforces the misunderstanding that food choices are moral choices. “There are so many reasons why a high-calorie meal can be the right choice for someone. Maybe you skipped breakfast and lunch is your first chance to put food in your body. Maybe you’re getting ready to do a long run. Maybe you’re out to dinner with friends, an experience that offers tremendous mental health benefits. Choosing the low-calorie salad in any of those scenarios won’t necessarily serve you. But we’re conditioned to believe it’s always the right choice.” Henry Dimbleby led the National Food Strategy, an independent review for the UK government. He thinks a more powerful policy than calorie labelling would be a reformulation tax, dealing with the least healthy of our ultra-processed foods. “We have to make it less attractive for companies to sell the stuff that makes us sick. It’s very politically difficult when you have a cost of living crisis, but I’m convinced it will happen – it’s either that or the NHS falls over.” Yeo is sanguine about the chances of us giving up or even cutting down on UPFs, but would like manufacturers to reformulate them, with more fibre added. “If you can make a plant-based burger bleed, I think you can add a bit more fibre into a chocolate bar,” he says. “We need to work with the people who are making the food. Whenever I say this out loud, the ‘Real Food’ brigade pop up: I am not trying to compare a chocolate bar – however much protein or fibre is in it – to a banana. Clearly, a banana is a banana, but sometimes, I want a treat. If you feel the need for a chocolate bar, or a lasagne, or a burger, rather than a banana, could there be a slightly healthier version of that burger or chocolate bar or frozen lasagne that you could buy?” He would like to see healthier food subsidised, too – not just carrots, but healthier processed foods as well. “At the moment, the cheapest choice is typically the most unhealthy choice.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Number crunching: why ultra-processed foods have a calorie problem,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/17/number-crunching-why-ultra-processed-foods-have-a-calorie-problem
5/17/2022,"Nearly half of existing fossil fuel production sites need to be shut down early if global heating is to be limited to 1.5C, the internationally agreed goal for avoiding climate catastrophe, according to a new scientific study. The assessment goes beyond the call by the International Energy Agency in 2021 to stop all new fossil fuel development to avoid the worst impacts of global heating, a statement seen as radical at the time. The new research reaches its starker conclusion by not assuming that new technologies will be able to suck huge amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere to compensate for the burning of coal, oil and gas. Experts said relying on such technologies was a risky gamble. The Guardian revealed last week that 195 oil and gas “carbon bombs” are planned by the industry. This means projects that would each produce at least 1bn tonnes of CO2. Together, these carbon bombs alone would drive global heating beyond the 1.5C limit. But the dozen biggest oil companies are on track to spend $103m (£81m) a day until 2030 on climate-busting schemes. Greg Muttitt, at the International Institute for Sustainable Development, was one of the leaders of the new research and said: “Halting new extraction projects is a necessary step, but still not enough to stay within our rapidly dwindling carbon budget. Some existing fossil fuel licences and production will need to be revoked and phased out early. Governments need to start tackling head-on how to do this in a fair and equitable way, which will require overcoming opposition from fossil fuel interests.” Kelly Trout, at Oil Change International, the other lead author of the work, said: “Our study reinforces that building new fossil fuel infrastructure is not a viable response to Russia’s war on Ukraine. The world has already tapped too much oil and gas.” The researchers said governments should accelerate the introduction of renewable energy and efficiency measures instead. The new study, published in the journal Environment Research Letters, analysed a database of more than 25,000 oil and gas fields and developed a new dataset of coal mines. The researchers found that fields and mines that have already been developed would lead to 936bn tonnes of CO2 when fully exploited and burned. That is 25 years of global emissions at today’s rate – the world’s scientists agree emissions must fall by half by 2030. The researchers calculated that 40% of developed fossil fuels must stay in the ground to have a 50-50 chance of global temperature rise stopping at 1.5C. Half the emissions would come from coal, a third from oil and a fifth from gas. The researchers found that almost 90% of developed reserves are located in just 20 countries, led by China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and the US, followed by Iran, India, Indonesia, Australia and Canada. The research only considered projects where companies had made final investment decisions, that means committed to spending billions on building rigs and pipelines to extract the fossil fuels. A 2021 study, led by Daniel Welsby at University College London, assessed all known reserves and found 90% of coal and 60% of oil and gas must remain unexploited. Welsby said: “The new study is a valuable contribution to our understanding of what fossil fuels are highly likely to be produced and the volume which needs to remain in the ground if global warming is to be limited.” But he noted the study did not fully account for methane, a potent greenhouse gas, or the oil and gas used for petrochemicals. The study did not estimate how much CO2 could be removed from the atmosphere by technology in future. “These technologies are unproven at scale,” said Muttitt. “There’s a lot of talk about them, but we believe it would be a mistake to predicate achieving climate goals on these being delivered at a very large scale. We just don’t know whether it will be possible in terms of financing or governance.” Maeve O’Connor, at the Carbon Tracker thinktank, the author of a new report, said: “Oil and gas companies are gambling on emissions [reducing] technologies that pose a huge risk to both investors and the climate. Most of these technologies are still at an early stage of development, with few large projects working at anything like the scale required by company goals, while solutions that involve tree planting require huge areas of land.” Research published in 2019 found that the world already had more fossil fuel power stations than needed and that some may need to be retired early. The new analysis found fossil fuel production sites also need to be closed, but how to do that is yet to be determined. “This is an absolutely key question,” said Muttitt. “One of the biggest barriers will be the legal infrastructure that oil and gas companies and some coal companies have constructed to defend their investments and their profitability, through treaties like the energy charter treaty [ECT].” The ECT allows companies to sue governments over lost profits. There is some discussion, he said, that European Union nations could withdraw from the treaty en masse. A small number of governments, including Denmark, Costa Rica, France, Ireland and California, have committed to stop issuing new fossil fuel licences. If more join, that could be a gamechanger, said Muttitt. Dan Jørgensen, the Danish climate and energy minister, said: “The Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance provides a way for governments to act together to begin a managed phase-out of oil and gas production to avoid dangerous levels of climate change.”",News/Environment,"Shut down fossil fuel production sites early to avoid climate chaos, says study",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/17/shut-down-fossil-fuel-production-sites-early-to-avoid-climate-chaos-says-study
5/17/2022,"Lacuna opens with an extremely peculiar author’s note. Fiona Snyckers informs the reader that her book is not a retelling of Disgrace (1999) by the Nobel prize-winning South African novelist JM Coetzee, but that it does have an “intertextual relationship” with that harrowing, controversial and much-garlanded novel. Lacuna will feature a character called John Coetzee who is “entirely fictional” and another called Lucy Lurie who, like her namesake in Disgrace, is the white victim of gang rape by black men but is otherwise “original and fictional”. “I use the character of Lucy to explore the phenomenon of white feminism in South Africa,” she announces. For Lucy is “trapped in her own racism and unconscious biases”. She is “solipsistic and selfish”. She makes “flawed life choices” and “practises a shallow form of feminism that does not take into account intersectionality”. Can you imagine if all authors framed their books in this way? “Anna Karenina will make some bad choices in this book.” “Captain Ahab acts out a damaging form of masculinity that does not take into account the feelings of the whale.” It may be that such prescriptions are more common in young adult fiction, where Snyckers made her name, but her tone reminded me more of a Soviet compendium of English writers that my husband once brought back from Russia, which introduces Wilde, Waugh and Wells with stern warnings about how a good communist is expected to interpret them. Only: what are we to make of her insistence that this victim of gang rape is “solipsistic and selfish”? Is this some kind of postmodern joke? I don’t know. Despite the fact that Lacuna is more heavily signposted than the M25, I’m still not entirely sure what it’s trying to say. It purports to be a feminist response to Coetzee’s novel, but it muddies the waters by rewriting the story of Disgrace and its invention in several fundamental ways. This version takes place in the present day rather than the more immediately post-apartheid setting of Disgrace. Lucy Lurie is not an earthy lesbian collectivist but a heterosexual junior academic who teaches in the same university department as John Coetzee in Cape Town. The real-life Coetzee had already written several acclaimed novels by the time he wrote Disgrace. Here, Coetzee is a sexist old fart approaching academic obscurity. However, when he hears of his young colleague’s brutal rape at her father’s farm, inspiration strikes and, to everyone’s surprise, he produces an international bestseller. The novel opens two years after the attack that made Lucy, 28, “South Africa’s number-one rape victim”. She is furious that Coetzee treated her trauma as a metaphor for the overthrow of white supremacy in South Africa and becomes intent on confronting him about it. She is similarly outraged that Coetzee chose not to describe the rape scene in his novel, leaving instead a “lacuna” – a space unfilled by women’s voices. “I am nobody’s lacuna,” she insists. Snyckers introduces a number of discrepancies. Here, Lucy is raped by six men as opposed to three (was three not enough?). She takes the morning after pill whereas the Lucy in Disgrace decides against terminating her pregnancy after the attack. And while her father, David, is an ex-academic who was dismissed from his position because of sexual misconduct, in this version it was his farm rather than Lucy’s that burned down, leading him to become fixated on the insurance claim. The plot twist, when it arrives, is not in itself ridiculous but the execution is, mainly because Snyckers is too caught up in her political messaging to explore the emotional implications. She seems to imagine that giving voice to a rape victim means reducing all the other characters to crude antagonists. Her father becomes evil; her best friend, Moira, is a compendium of every insensitive thing you could say to make a traumatised rape victim snap out of it (“Don’t you ever get horny, Lucy?”). And the beef with Coetzee is fundamentally misguided. Her misreading centres on the false idea that the rape in Disgrace functions entirely as a convenient post-apartheid metaphor and that Lucy’s decision to keep the child is a fantasy on Coetzee’s part about a happy mixed-race South African future unencumbered by history. The original novel is subtler, bleaker, more ambivalent. Any sense of redemption for the characters is mixed up with ruin. You can interpret Lucy’s decision to keep the child in a number of different ways: as a radical act of forgiveness, as a weird form of white reparation, as a way of punishing her father or even simply as an assertion of the agency that Snyckers seems convinced that she lacks. And it’s not as if the Lucy in Disgrace is lacking in self-awareness. “You behave as if everything I do is part of the story of your life,” Lucy tells her father at one point. “You are the main character, I am a minor character who doesn’t make an appearance until halfway through.” It’s Coetzee who invites the feminist retelling. There’s another discrepancy that’s hard to account for too. Despite Snycker’s fondness for terms such as “intersectionality” and “white fragility”, and her concern about female voices being erased, she has completely written out the character of Melanie Isaacs, the student who is coerced (and arguably, on one occasion, raped) by David Lurie. In Disgrace, she is referred to as “the dark one” and many critics have interpreted that as meaning she is black or mixed race. This is the event that gives the book its title. Perhaps it would have helped if Coetzee had spelled all this out in big capital letters at the beginning.  Lacuna by Fiona Snyckers is published by Europa Editions (£12.99).

5/17/2022,"Lacy Hollings watched the billowing black smoke rise a hundred feet from her door and sensed a disaster waiting to happen. It was 2006, and she had been deployed to the Ghazi province in Afghanistan as an interrogator and linguist with the United States army. Every day, the dark cloud lingered, stinging her eyes, charring her lungs, and making it difficult to breathe. What Hollings was seeing was a burn pit, an area roughly the size of a basketball court where all the waste from the base – human sewage, food, tires and metal – was discarded, doused in fuel, and then set on fire with a match. It had a pungently chemical smell and would sizzle and crackle. The smoke lingered for months, making Hollings’s one-mile runs around the base increasingly unpleasant. She knew there was no way she could live so close to the burn pit and not go home sick, referring to it among friends as “a ticking timebomb”. Dark soot would spray into her tissue whenever she blew her nose, an ominous sign that the smoke had entered her body. And indeed, only a year after she returned home she discovered her first of five cancerous tumors. Congress has finally recognized the dangers of burn pit exposure in the form of the Honoring Our Pact Act, a sweeping bipartisan bill that passed the House on 3 March 2022. The bill extends healthcare to 3.5 million veterans affected by burn pit exposure, but it has yet to become law and will only protect veterans with 23 registered conditions. For female veterans like Hollings, who make up about 17% of the US military, their exposure symptoms are often outside this list. And even in cases when they are included – like that of Catherine O’Connors, who deployed to Iraq with the marines in 2005 – it can take female veterans years to access the benefits they deserve. “This is just another instance where women veterans are not acknowledged for their specific needs within the system,” said Jennifer Pacanowski, founder of the non-profit Women Veterans Empowered and Thriving. “Or, where their service-connected disabilities are not associated with where they were stationed.” Rosie Torres, the founder of BurnPits360, an organization that supports veterans suffering from toxic exposure and who worked for the Department of Veterans Affairs for 23 years, says that even though the VA is a government administration, it could do more to help. “I can’t even imagine what veterans outside the system are going through against the bureaucracy within,” Torres said. “Even if they pass the Honor Our Pact, we will be adding illnesses to our list and calling on Congress to make these changes.” When Hollings was told in the Bay Pines VA medical center in March 2021 that she needed yet another surgery, she felt nothing. A frank, unemotive voice in her head intoned, “OK, great, another tumor, where’s it at this time?” as her collected, outward self agreed to have the operation on 4 April. This was the fifth serious health problem Hollings had since returning from Afghanistan in 2007 at the age of 27. The first was an ovarian cyst, the size of a softball, which was removed during her pregnancy. The next was a melanoma on her back, then came a parathyroid tumor, a rare growth in the four glands located around her neck. And finally, two blood clots the size of golf balls, the most recent of which Hollings was treated for last year. “I know I am going to keep on finding tumors,” she said. “It’s just a matter of time until I find one too late.” When Hollings graduated from the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California, at 21, she was excited to join the army and put her years of linguistic training to good use. Although frustrated at being assigned to Afghanistan, where she couldn’t practice Arabic, she quickly fell in love with the place and the people. Her optimism waned, however, when it was time to return to Indiana and deal with the arduous VA disability services. As advised, Hollings claimed everything she could, noting the mental health problems she suffered as well as her exposure to burn pits, which she thought would lead to later health complications. She heard nothing for a year. Then she received a denial for the burn pit-related problems. She was given no chance to talk to anybody or get an explanation for her case. Several times, she tried arguing on the phone, saying: “Look, these burn pits have caused these issues, caused my fibromyalgia. Here is the documentation, and here is why.” Yet Hollings remembers the disability services responding, “Absolutely, you have these conditions; absolutely, they are disabling and terrifying. But there is no connection between these illnesses and burn pit exposure.” Hollings does receive medical compensation for depressive disorder and chronic hip pain but says the VA still refuses to consider or acknowledge the causes of her other conditions. Now that her tumors have been removed, she says it is no longer considered a problem to the VA. But if she could get one more chance to talk to them again, she would say, “Quit dodging the bullet; it happened, do the right thing and pay for our injuries.” On 12 March 2022, Catherine O’Connor left the Memorial Sloan Kettering cancer hospital on New York’s Upper East Side and walked into Central Park with her yellow labrador. Her clothes were her usual, old, even – boots, sweatpants and a waterproof green jacket – but the scar that ran along her neck, visible still under the shadow of her chin, was new. As was the swelling of her right cheek caused by the operation she had just undergone. O’Connor deployed to Iraq aged 20 as a cyber networks operator in the Marine Corps. Those days, the military seemed unconcerned about the toxicity of setting carcinogens on fire. Her job was to make sure that no one was stealing from the burn pits at the Al Asad airbase in which she was living, and where sensitive documents were destroyed. For 12 hours a day, O’Connor would drive around the vicinity, making sure no one stole from the dump. To the best of her memory, she remembers thinking this couldn’t be good for her. “At 20, though,” she said, “everyone feels invincible.” It wasn’t until O’Connor returned home in 2006 to continue her studies that she began to think about the consequences of living near the burn pits. Fourteen years later, there were repercussions. In November 2021, O’Connor started feeling pain in her ear, as if she had been punched. When she went to a doctor, he said her ears were fine, but there was a lump in the back of her mouth that needed attention. A biopsy revealed salivary gland cancer, common only in people above 60. O’Connor was 38. “This is incredibly surprising,” said the oral surgeon. O’Connor spent entire days on hold with the VA, trying to figure out whom to talk to or how to move forward. Luckily, as she worked as a lawyer at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, the firm covered her medical bills. When she checked in for treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering, one of the best cancer hospitals in the world, O’Connor asked her surgeon about the burn pit connection. The Honor Our Pact legislation had been in the media frequently, and she wanted an expert opinion. “Environmental exposure may entirely be the cause,” he responded. “There is no hereditary explanation for your cancer.” Surprisingly, his answer helped O’Connor cope with her condition. “There’s a feeling of ‘what did I do wrong?’ that comes with getting cancer,” she said. “The randomness of my diagnoses seemed so unfair, but knowing there could be a cause made me feel better.” While O’Connor’s cancer was slow-growing, she often wishes she had found it earlier. The surgery took 12 hours, with the surgeon taking grafts from her hip and arm. “This could have been avoided” is a thought that often tortures her. “While I know the science is just not there yet to confirm, I think if I could turn back time, and you could tell me that conclusively and absolutely that my condition was linked to my exposure, I would not have deployed.”",News/Society,How the US is failing female veterans suffering illness from toxic burn pits,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/17/burn-pits-us-military-female-veterans-illness
5/17/2022,"On the unspoilt Lincolnshire coast, where dog walkers enjoy the five miles of golden sandy beach and families take holidays in the caravan parks beyond the dunes, the efforts of British politicians to persuade the public nuclear energy is green, safe and clean do not seem to be gaining traction. A skull glowers down from the sand dunes on to Mablethorpe Beach, a portent of death and destruction, and a throwback to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament protests of the 1980s. It is here, in a 24-hectare (60-acre) disused gas terminal bordering the beach, that Boris Johnson’s big bet on nuclear energy is being tested. Experts on nuclear waste have said that until the UK builds a large underground nuclear waste dump or geological deposit facility (GDF) to safely store the 700,000 cubic metres of radioactive waste from the country’s 20th-century nuclear programme, no new nuclear plants should be created. It is a problem that has dogged the development of nuclear energy not only in the UK, but across Europe and in the US: how to safely and permanently store the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle. The solution of a GDF was put forward nearly 50 years ago, but the UK is no nearer to putting spades into the ground, and the cost of decommissioning and disposing of the country’s radioactive waste has risen to £131bn. When the prime minister recently promised eight new nuclear plants in as many years, the problem of the highly radioactive waste they would add to the stockpile was not mentioned. It is, however, something very much at the forefrontof the minds of those living in the remote Lincolnshire village of Theddlethorpe and the neighbouring town of Mablethorpe. Residents learned the seaside resort could become home to a vast nuclear dump – not from officials, but when a local BBC news programme broke the story, revealing talks had been taking place for two years. The gas terminal site is under consideration for the onshore facility and the dump would be dug six miles off Mablethorpe Beach, between 200 and 1,000 metres below the sea. It would be made up of subterranean tunnels and vaults, with natural and artificial barriers to minimise the escape of radioactivity, according to documents from Radioactive Waste Management, now part of the Nuclear Waste Services (NWS). Inside, the waste from the past 50 years of nuclear programmes, most of which is temporarily stored at Sellafield in Cumbria, would be deposited and sealed off for ever. The dump would also have room for another 73,000 cubic metres of waste from a new nuclear programme of up to 16GW. The revelations sparked a grassroots protest which appears to have spread quickly among the retired population, many of whom moved to the area for its coastal beauty. Anti-nuclear signs dominate country lanes, skeletons have been erected on the beach and outside homes, and a series of public meetings have been held over the past eight months by a group called Guardians of the East Coast. “I was totally shocked when we found out,” says Sara Bright, who lives in Mablethorpe. “This area was just not somewhere we ever thought they would put a nuclear dump. This is a tourist area, we have this beautiful beach, there is investment in tourism here. We rely on that tourism income and the idea that they could consider putting a nuclear dump here is just shocking to me.” It is responses such as these that have repeatedly seen off attempts to build an underground dump for nuclear waste in the UK. One nine years ago in Cumbria was rejected after an impassioned campaign by environmentalists and local people. This time, however, the approach has been different, NWS says. The government agency privately acknowledges that attempts in the past to find a site for the dump have been shrouded in secrecy. Any location for a GDF has to be based on science, the geology of the area and the technical requirements of a mammoth engineering project. Crucially, though, the community that will host it must also be supportive. This time, NWS invited communities to put their area forward. Four areas have identified themselves as willing to consider hosting the facility – Allerdale, Mid Copeland and South Copeland in Cumbria, and Theddlethorpe. NWS promises the community that hosts the dump will benefit from great economic development opportunities including jobs and investment in roads and railways. In Cumbria, where a million-pound pot has been made available for local projects, a trickle of the promised stream of money has begun flowing: £47,801 on a BMX pump track at Seascale, £9,576 for the Beckermet reading and recreation rooms and £8,122 for an electronic scoreboard at Seascale cricket club. In Lincolnshire a community partnership is in the process of being set up.Jon Collins, a former leader of Nottingham city council and the independent chair of a working party set up in Theddlethorpe to decide on the GDF, has been holding meetings to provide information and answer questions from local people for several months. “If this was just a process of someone trying to sell an idea to the community I would not have been interested in taking part,” he says. “What I think is really interesting in public opinion terms is that sense of this is a big infrastructure project and it has got local implications; we need to work with the community and we are asking the community to make a judgment on this at the end of the process and if people don’t want it then it doesn’t happen. “We talk to people about safety, about why the area is being considered and what kind of timescale we are talking about,” he says. “Most people are reasonably open minded, some people are pretty much not in favour and some are concerned about the potential impact locally.” An initial assessment has concluded that the Lincolnshire site has the potential to host a GDF. Acknowledging the natural beauty of the area, NWS promises it will contribute to protecting conservation areas around the site and incorporate flood mitigation measures. The agency has also attempted to placate those who complain the dump will kill tourism in the area. “There may be an opportunity to create a GDF/scientific centre of excellence, which itself could generate significant visitor traffic and even become a tourism point of interest,” the assessment says. For the Mablethorpe councillor and Labour leader on East Lindsey district council, Tony Howard, NSW’s promises on behalf of government are nothing more than a bribe. “Suddenly they want us to have a nuclear dump and they are promising us railways, roads, local jobs. It’s just 30 pieces of silver, a bribe, the idea that everyone is going to go from selling burgers in the summer to becoming nuclear experts and working on this site is ridiculous. There will be specialists brought in to do the work.” He questions the very idea that nuclear energy is green, clean and safe at all. “We know very well in this area the dangers of nuclear, every year we host children from Chernobyl who come to the seaside for a holiday. We are fully aware that if things go wrong at a site like this, they stay wrong permanently and that does not sit well with trying to promote the town as a place with a superb beach which is wonderful for families. It jars. “We should be investing in solar, wind, desalination. This site would be perfect for that. Nuclear is a folly.” Ken Smith of Guardians of the East Coast is worried that the process of reaching a decision could take up to 15 years. “In that time tourist investment will drain away. Why would you want to invest in a caravan park if you think a nuclear dump is going to be built next to it? This whole process should stop right now.” As the tourist season in Mablethorpe begins, NSW appears to be spreading its bets, seeking other areas to come forward. Its director for community engagement and siting, Simon Hughes, says: “The UK search for a suitable site is about engaging in dialogue with communities and building an understanding of what hosting a GDF might mean for them, so that we can all make an informed decision. “The previous process was very rigid and demanded decisions were made at set points and before all the information was available. The new process allows communities to engage in a much more flexible way, allowing questions to be answered without commitment. Communities also have the option to withdraw from the process at any time and will have to give explicit consent before construction can commence. If the local community doesn’t want it, it won’t happen. “With over 60 years of legacy waste currently stored temporarily in surface sites around the country, developing a GDF is about delivering a safe, secure and environmentally sound long-term solution that protects current and future generations, ensuring it works for the host community and the country as a whole.”",News/Environment,‘It’s a bribe’: the coastal areas that could become the UK’s nuclear dump,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/17/its-a-bribe-the-coastal-areas-that-could-become-the-uks-nuclear-dump
5/17/2022,"The suspected perpetrator of the deadly shooting in Buffalo, New York, on Saturday may have been the latest mass killer to be motivated by a growing fixation of rightwingers – environmental degradation and the impact of overpopulation. The attack, that left 10 people shot dead and three wounded, has been described as a “hate crime and a case of racially-motivated violent extremism” by the FBI. The 18-year-old suspect allegedly began firing his weapon in the car park of the Tops supermarket in Buffalo, before entering the store and continuing his murderous rampage inside, streaming the attack live online. Authorities believe the killer chose the supermarket due to the surrounding area’s sizable Black community, with an 180-page manifesto believed to have been written and posted online by the suspect referencing his desire to “kill as many Blacks as possible” and his belief in the “great replacement theory”, which holds that white people are at risk of losing their status and traditional culture because of immigrants. The manifesto, also, however, includes theories on the environment that are similar to screeds espoused by other recent mass murderers. The Buffalo suspect calls himself an “eco-fascist” and blames migration for harm to the environment in the document posted online. “For too long we have allowed the left to co-opt the environmentalist movement to serve their own needs,” the Buffalo manifesto states. “The left has controlled all discussion regarding environmental preservation whilst simultaneously presiding over the continued destruction of the natural environment itself through mass immigration and uncontrolled urbanization, whilst offering no true solution to either issue.” This invocation of eco-fascism, or green racism, echoes that of a white nationalist who killed 51 people in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019. “The invaders are the ones over-populating the world,” the Christchurch murderer wrote in his own manifesto. “Kill the invaders, kill the overpopulation and by doing so save the environment.” Just a few months after the New Zealand attack, a gunman killed 23 people in El Paso, Texas, leaving behind a note that also blamed overpopulation for causing pollution. “If we can get rid of enough people, then our way of life can become more sustainable,” he wrote. Studies have repeatedly shown that migration itself does not cause an increase in carbon emissions or other pollution – indeed, American-born people are far larger consumers of resources than new immigrants – and that voracious consumption, rather than population per se, is the primary driver of the climate and ecological crises that currently grip the world. However, the latest shooting shows that a dangerously warped vision of environmentalism is now becoming an increasingly common animating force for rightwing extremists, according to Betsy Hartmann, an expert in the environment and migration at Hampshire College. “It’s extremely frightening,” she said. “Eco-fascism has always been a part of white supremacy, even going back to Hitler, but it would seem to me in white supremacist circles it’s becoming a more accepted part of the ideology. It’s not an outlier anymore.” Hartmann said the rise of Donald Trump and Republicans’ embrace of anti-immigrant rhetoric is fueling the spread of so-called eco-fascism, as well as growing alarm, particularly among younger people, over the climate emergency. “For younger people, the more apocalyptic images of climate change can fit into the white supremacist view of apocalypse, too,” she said. “It’s scary how much this person is taking from the Christchurch and El Paso killings, how he’s inspired by those things. It shows how powerful this has become, given how explicit it is now.” A recasting of environmental concern in a racist context has been embraced by several prominent figures in the US, such as the Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who has called immigrants “unclean” and a threat to America’s environment, and the Republican attorney-general of Arizona, who has called for a border wall to be erected to avoid migrants not just arriving in the US via Mexico but allegedly worsening climate change. Meanwhile, several rightwing political parties in Europe have resorted to what academics call “ecobordering”, where restrictions on immigration are touted as vital to protect the nativist stewardship of nature and where the ills of environmental destruction are laid upon those from developing countries, ignoring the far larger consumptive habits of wealthy nations and that impact on other countries, creating climate refugees. In an analysis of 22 far-right parties in Europe, researchers found this thinking was rife and “portrays effects as causes and further normalizes racist border practices and colonial amnesia within Europe”.

5/17/2022,"To really get to grips with where your home is needlessly costing you energy a thermal imaging camera is a great tool: it shows up exactly where the hotspots for heat loss are, in multicolour. In some parts of Britain it is possible to borrow one for free so you can find where to target your energy-saving efforts without any upfront cost. Transition towns – communities that are working to promote sustainability and cut emissions – often have a camera loan scheme for local people. Bear in mind that most of these projects are very small scale and rely on volunteers: if you want to borrow one on demand you will need to go for a commercial hire company. To use a thermal imaging camera effectively you need about a 10-degree difference between the temperatures indoors and outdoors, so the schemes typically operate only through the winter months. Sustainable St Albans is one group that runs a loan scheme – it’s been doing so since 2014 during which time several hundred locals have used it. Residents need to sign up for a training session before they can take a camera home, with the next one set to take place in the autumn. (People who are interested can sign up to a monthly email newsletter where they will see details at the time.) St Albans residents who have borrowed the cameras have reported being surprised by what they saw, with one saying there was “a lot more heat loss than envisaged”, and another saying “even drawing the curtains made a difference”. Transition Bath also has a camera that people can borrow after training – Philip Haile from the group says this is because cameras can provide false positives, which users need to be careful to avoid. “Typically the camera is a good conversation point in motivating people to think about their energy,” he says. However, he adds that often it “visualises issues the homeowners are already aware of – for example, missing loft insulation”. In the Peak District, Transition Belper runs a scheme for the DE56 area with one camera and a volunteer who carries out a handful of surveys each winter. These are done for free but people can donate to the group if they wish. A project called CHEESE (Cold Homes Energy Efficiency Survey Experts), currently running in Bristol but soon to go nationwide, offers paid-for surveys to those who can afford them, and free surveys to those in fuel poverty. The cost of a survey on a two-bedroom house is £135, says Nettie Burd from the organisation behind the project. “They could get that back within one or two years,” she says. Some households have cut their bills by a third after having a survey done. A survey of a 10-room house will take about three hours, and the person doing it will make suggestions for energy-saving measures as they go. “One of the surveyors said recently that the reasons people get a survey done were three Cs: comfort, carbon or cost,” Burd says. “It might be that someone says: ‘It’s cold but we don’t why – we need to find out what the problems are.’ Or they might be deciding to fit a heat pump, or they might be trying to cut their bills.” For those who are struggling to even afford to put the heating on, the survey can alleviate some of the difficulty, she says, if they can get the work done. One in three of the surveys carried out by the organisation is done for free for a household in fuel poverty. They can show the results to their landlord or see if they qualify for grants.",Lifestyle/Money,Hot spots: how thermal imaging can help find where your home is leaking cash,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/17/hot-spots-thermal-imaging-home-cash
5/17/2022,"Ihave just been to the Bath festival of books to talk with my esteemed colleague John Crace about his book A Farewell to Calm. It has been two years, more or less, without these events – two years when we had to pretend the experience was the same as we watched on a tiny screen, only half listening, only for it all to come rushing back: the steamy crowd (it had been raining), the thrill of the spoken word. There is one specific thing I love about book festivals. It’s a convention that you have to spend the first five or even 10 minutes pretending to think the audience are politically neutral. You enter into the charade of thinking these are just regular, respectable people, who may disagree with the government but equally, may agree with it; they may be remainers, they may be leavers; they may be left, they may be right. Just think of them as shareholders, except instead of buying shares, they buy books. Yet this is the absolute opposite of the truth. You will never meet a group of people more consistent in their views, and not because most of them also go to the same pilates class. Every man jack of them voted remain, and they are considerably more leftwing than those at any meeting of any political party. In the interests of sounding mature, I should probably pretend to think there are rightwing book festivals, which people attend to worship David Starkey or ask creepy questions of Niall Ferguson, but I don’t think that. If even the Cheltenham literature festival turns the town briefly into a people’s republic, I can’t think what town would host a Toryfest. The audience absolutely hate being politically misidentified, and they spend those first 10 minutes desperately signalling, with spontaneous clapping and foot-stamping, to indicate that nobody hates the government more than they. So it’s like a panto, with an audience metaphorically shouting “He’s behind you,” but really meaning it – as if you might not know. The atmosphere, it probably goes without saying, is electrifying. Sure, read this brilliant book if you wish, but you’ll have more fun buying it at a book festival. Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

5/17/2022,"At the start of April we were pulled over by the police and told that we were driving without insurance. I didn’t panic at first as I knew we had received the new policy information from Direct Line and I thought it was a big misunderstanding. We paid £90 on the spot for the temporary car insurance we needed to be able to legally drive away in our vehicle. However, it turned out that Direct Line had given us a new policy number but no actual policy. In December I received an email from Direct Line that said: “your car insurance is coming up for renewal”, which had a “new policy number” in bold at the top. The quote looked OK so I took it off my to-do list and when I received a “renewal pack” in the post it seemed like extra confirmation. Obviously, that was not the case. We need a letter of indemnity from Direct Line to backdate our insurance to 6 January (when our policy ran out) in order to contest the £300 fine and six points on my husband’s licence. However, it has refused as it says it informed us by text and letter that we needed to take action to renew our policy. We had to pay £713 to renew, instead of the original £432 quoted, as well as the £300 fine. JD, London You are mortified by this experience after being wrongfooted by the correspondence you received from Direct Line, which included the new policy number. You also did not spot that the payment had not left your account. You complain Direct Line’s vague language led you to wrongly assume that your policy had been renewed, but it will not budge. Direct Line told us: “We are sorry that the customer believes the correspondence relating to their new policy number was confusing. However, having carefully reviewed our correspondence, it was highlighted that they would need to proactively confirm the renewal as the policy had not been set to renew automatically. “We would ask customers to carefully read all materials supplied. If an insurance policy is not set to auto-renew, the policyholder must contact us by a set date and arrange payment if they wish to remain covered.” Auto-renewal is a bit of a “double edged sword”, says James Daley, the managing director of Fairer Finance. “It often gets called out as being bad, but for things like car and home insurance, it ensures that you at least have some cover.” “Insurers used to always automatically opt you into auto-renewal but the Financial Conduct Authority has told them they need to give customers a clear choice. This has led to firms changing the way they deal with auto-renewal and is sure to catch a few people out.” We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

If you are unable to cast a ballot in person at a polling station on election day, there are several other ways to vote. At this election extra provision has been made to ensure those affected by the recent floods in Queensland and NSW, and people affected by Covid, are not disenfranchised. If you can’t make it on the day, you can vote in advance at a pre-polling station. A list of these will be published on the AEC website. Mobile polling facilities are also set up in some hospitals, nursing homes, prisons and remote areas in advance of polling day, although at this election that service will be limited by Covid considerations (see below). You can apply via the AEC website to have your ballot papers sent to you in the mail. These must be completed by close of polling on election day and returned to the AEC, which allows 13 days after that for the ballots to arrive. In some countries you may be able to access an overseas voting centre – a list will be posted on the AEC website. Otherwise you need to apply for a postal vote, allowing enough time for the papers to be mailed to you. The AEC has expanded the provision of voting by phone (traditionally used for blind or low-vision Australians) to accommodate people who may be required to isolate because they have Covid or they are a close contact of someone who does. However, it has warned the process may not be entirely flawless. People who expect to be in isolation on polling day may apply for a postal vote. Those who test positive or who are close contacts of someone who tests positive between Wednesday and Saturday should contact the AEC to arrange a vote by phone. Close contacts who return a negative rapid test should check with their state or territory whether they are entitled to leave isolation to vote in person. At the ballot box, you will be handed two pieces of paper. The smaller is for the House of Representatives, which is elected using preferential voting. You must number every box in order of your preference for your vote to be valid. The larger is for the Senate, which consists of 76 members, 12 for each state, and two for each territory. On the Senate ballot paper, you can vote in one of two ways. First, you can number at least six boxes above the line, indicating the parties or groups you prefer in the order of your choice. Or you can vote below the line, meaning you are voting individually for the candidates nominated by each party or group. In this case you must number at least 12 boxes to cast a valid vote. There are 151 members of the House of Representatives, so one party needs to win at least 76 seats to form a majority government. Going into the election, the Liberal-National Coalition holds 76 seats, Labor holds 69 and the six others are held by minor parties and independents. To reach 76, Labor would need to retain their current number of seats and gain another seven. However, picking up an extra four seats from Liberal or Nationals would be enough for them to overtake the Coalition.

According to analysis by Green: “Labor needs a uniform swing of 3.1% to gain four seats and 3.3% to gain seven. Yet Labor is defending 13 seats on a margin of up to 3%.” If the Coalition loses even one seat, but Labor fails to gain seven, Australia would have a hung parliament. In that case one or other of the major parties would have to secure the support of enough minor party or independent MPs to form government. A new wave of independents is running in Coalition-held seats at this election, which may increase the chances of a hung parliament.",News/Australia news,Australian election 2022 voters’ guide: everything you need to know ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/17/australian-election-2022-voters-guide-how-to-vote-when-who-everything-you-need-to-know-australia-federal-poll-day
5/17/2022,"Hello, and if you’re marking the days off on your Partygate calendar when you wake up each morning, it’s time to chalk up another one. When we learned last week that the Metropolitan police had issued another 50 fines, there was an obvious next question: how many more are there to go? And when can we expect to know that the investigation which might decide the fate of the prime minister is at an end? So far, there are no good answers. This matters for the civil servants still waiting to learn if they will face a fixed penalty notice. But it also creates vast uncertainty over the future direction of the country at a time of overlapping national crises. For today’s newsletter, I spoke to Guardian police and crime correspondent Vikram Dodd, and former chief superintendent in the Metropolitan police Dal Babu, about what, exactly, is taking so long. That’s right after the headlines. Ukraine | More than 260 Ukrainian soldiers were evacuated from the besieged Azovstal steel plant in the port city of Mariupol, appearing to cede control of the city to Russia and ending the longest and bloodiest battle of the war. Economy | The governor of the Bank of England has warned of “apocalyptic” rises in food prices as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Andrew Bailey blamed the war for the highest inflation in the UK in three decades. Prevent | A draft report on the government’s counter-terrorism programme makes the controversial claim that it is too focused on rightwing extremism rather than Islamist extremism, the Guardian has learned. Brexit | Boris Johnson has said a legal move to ditch parts of the Northern Ireland protocol is only an “insurance” policy. Ahead of an expected statement from Liz Truss to MPs today, it emerged that the legislation has been delayed for some weeks. Football | The Blackpool forward Jake Daniels has ended decades of silence within men’s football to become the first current player in the UK to come out as gay in more than 30 years. Daniels, 17, said he hoped to be a role model. It’s been more than 100 days since then-Metropolitan police commissioner Cressida Dick announced an investigation into Downing Street parties, and more than 80 since her acting replacement Stephen House said he expected the work on “partygate” to take weeks, rather than months. There is an awful lot we don’t know about Operation Hillman, the codename for the investigation – and meanwhile some important questions about the criteria of Durham constabulary’s probe of the “beergate” story involving Keir Starmer. But we know this: it’s definitely been months now. So far this week, the most substantial development has been Jacob Rees-Mogg helpfully suggesting that it was time to rethink fixed penalty notices altogether. To be clear, that is not a substantial development. “Some stories, you get a broad sense of where it’s heading, and the likely level of severity,” said Vikram Dodd. “With this one I just don’t think we know with any meaningful certainty.” Here are some of the key issues for the Met (and, to a lesser extent, Durham constabulary), with the massive caveat that it’s easier to flesh out the questions than the answers. Why is it taking so much longer than they initially expected? Dal Babu has some sympathy for the scale of the undertaking facing officers involved in Operation Hillman. “It’s a huge undertaking,” he said. “They’re investigating a large number of parties, and they need to go through each one individually with a view to the wider strategic picture of how they’ve decided to go about it.” At the same time, Babu added, “it’s not rocket science. These are entry level offences, the kind of things you’d normally get probationary constables to look at. And there’s all the evidence you’d ever wanted: a crime scene, professional [police] witnesses, card entry where people tap in and out, loads of CCTV. It’s almost impossible not to get an accurate result.” “The logical explanation is that there’s more work than they expected – more evidence, and/or more suspects who they are looking at to issue fines,” said Vikram. You might think that suggests House’s February estimate was rash, or points to a failure by the Met to sensibly assess what they were dealing with back in January: in any case, nothing the force has said will let you know. Since House’s statement, there has been no public reevaluation of the likely timeline. It might be easier to understand if we knew the order in which the Met was approaching the 12 incidents under investigation, but the outcomes so far suggest that it is not doing so chronologically – and the Financial Times has reported that those dealing with it in No10 feel there is “absolutely no discernible strategy” to the sequencing, much to their chagrin. “We have little solid idea where they are in the process,” said Vikram. “It could be we’re barely halfway – if Johnson gets five more fines it wouldn’t be amazing; if he got none it wouldn’t be amazing either.” Who is advising the Met on strategy? In high profile cases, said Babu, “usually what’s called a gold group is put together – specialist advisers, internal or external, whose work sits alongside the main investigation.” A gold group is meant to help the force deal with the outside factors that may play into their work; participants might be experts in communications, or stakeholders with a well-informed view of the likely impact of the results. “The gold group is not involved in the details of the investigation,” said Babu. “But they might say, for example: what about the implications of doing an investigation during an election?” There may be a gold group involved in Operation Hillman – but if there is, the Met isn’t saying who’s on it, or whether it exists at all. “It’s one of the shortfalls of the system – there’s no transparency for assessing who’s advising if it’s a bespoke group for a particular incident,” said Babu. “It can be very arbitrary – it’s entirely up to the police.”” What are the criteria for an investigation or a fine in Downing Street? The fact that Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak were both fined for what appears to have been one of the most minor incidents under investigation, the “ambushed by cake” birthday celebration in the Number 10 cabinet room, might appear to suggest that the bar is being set low. On the other hand, Johnson is reported to have told friends that he does not expect to receive further penalties – and said on 4 May that he had not received a police questionnaire about at least one key event: a leaving party for his aide Lee Cain, at which he is believed to have poured drinks. What are the criteria for Durham constabulary to issue a retrospective fine? There is, meanwhile, the separate matter of the “beergate” claims about Keir Starmer’s takeaway curry and beer during a campaign visit to Durham. Starmer has said he will resign if he is fined, but that leaves open the possibility that the police will find a probable breach but decide against issuing him with a fixed penalty notice – the approach it took in the Dominic Cummings case. (When asked, Labour shadow ministers have deflected by suggesting that one without the other is unlikely.) Vikram cautions against relying too heavily on that precedent to draw assumptions about what will happen to Starmer – and Dal Babu agrees: “Right from the start, from the very first conviction by the British Transport Police which was overturned, we have seen the difficulties that come with rushed legislation. We don’t know what will happen even with an apparent precedent.” Why is the Met sharing so little information? There are many more fundamental unknowns over the “partygate” case, says Vik: “Are you talking to the Crown Prosecution Service? How many staff do you have on it? The Met are being super secretive, even by their standards.” Babu has some sympathy for the difficulty of the position the police now find themselves in. “I don’t think there should be an investigation in public or on a press deadline,” he said. Ultimately, though, he views that as a problem of the Met’s – and in particular Cressida Dick’s – own creation, thanks to their initial reluctance to take on the task. The Met refused to look into the allegations until the press and Sue Gray’s inquiry had already uncovered a great deal of evidence. “If you’d used a little bit of common sense, you would have acted sooner,” he said. “If they had got on with it then, it could all have been done and dusted by now. Instead, it’s all been very Inspector Clouseau.” Simon Parkin’s long read about the commercialisation of Albert Einstein, and the university which has made a fortune out of him, is absolutely great. It’s not clear he would have been happy – but they’ve made more than $250m. Archie Grace Dent is back with a third season of Comfort Eating and it’s incredibly enjoyable. Dent’s first guest is television presenter James May and together they ask all the big questions, such as: is soup a main? And what counts as proper food sharing etiquette? Nimo With tiny pensions, poor mobility, and relatives who in many cases have already fled, the oldest women in Ukraine are enduring the worst of Russia’s invasion. Angelina Kariakina met some of them. Archie Julia Serano writes this fascinating piece that examines why men harass women on the street. Drawing on her experiences as a trans woman and academic theory, Serano explores the ways in which people who are marked as “public spectacles” receive unwanted attention. Nimo In this week’s rendition of a new start at 60, Paula Cocozza talks to Marian Elliot, who, after a 40-year marriage, finds herself divorced. Elliot navigates her new life that comes with the highs of new friendship and new community and the lows of isolation and loneliness. Nimo Coleen Rooney finished up in the witness box revealing that not even her husband had known about the sting which led to her infamous “It’s ……… Rebekah Vardy’s account” revelation. Jim Waterson was there to hear Hugh Tomlinson QC, for Vardy, analyse what was meant by all the dots, suggesting she’d presented the reveal like a “whodunnit” – only for Rooney to insist she has “dots in a lot of conversations”. Today, Wayne is expected to take the stand. Rooney said she decided not to go to Vardy before posting the accusation in public: “I know it sounds tough – but at the time I didn’t think she would tell the truth even if I confronted her.” Football | Arsenal fell to a 2-0 defeat to Newcastle, a result which means they will be beaten to Champions League qualification by Tottenham Hotspur if their rivals secure a point against Everton in their final game of the season. Tennis | The former junior Wimbledon champion and Olympic silver medallist Laura Robson has announced her retirement at the age of 28. Robson, who peaked in the top 30, had undergone three hip operations. Football | The government is concerned that the £4.25bn takeover of Chelsea could collapse because of the alleged refusal by Roman Abramovich to accept a new sale structure. Less than a fortnight before the deadline for a deal, Whitehall sources say that they fear Chelsea could go out of business. “Bank chief’s warning over ‘apocalyptic’ food prices” – the front-page lead in the Guardian today. The Express, the Daily Mail and the Telegraph all have similar splash headlines, adding that the Bank’s governor says he is “helpless” in the fight against inflation. The Financial Times’ line is “Bailey deflects blame for soaring inflation on to global ‘shocks’”. “For once, just do the right thing” says the Mirror – it reports the Tories are expected today to block help for struggling families funded by a windfall tax on energy companies. The Times says “Petrol firm ‘profiteers’ fail to pass on duty cut”. “Proud to say I’m gay” – the Metro on Jake Daniels, whom the i quotes as saying “I don’t want to lie any more”. The Sun says “Wagatha trial – Coleen: Vardy’s evil texts”. Florida’s ‘don’t say gay’ bill Florida’s legislature has introduced a bill that would allow parents to sue school districts if they consider lessons to not be ‘age-appropriate’. A bit of good news to remind you that the world’s not all bad Angelina Namiba was diagnosed with HIV in 1993. She thought she had months to live. But three decades later she is alive and well and running a support group in east London called 4M Mentor Mothers Network for new mothers living with HIV. The program is led by Black women from migrant and refugee backgrounds who support new and expectant mothers to come to terms with their diagnosis and supporting them through the pregnancy.
