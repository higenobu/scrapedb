1/12/2022,"As the pandemic’s second, gruelling year drew to a close and Covid rates in Rio de Janeiro plunged to levels unseen since it began, the Brazilian city’s health secretary, Daniel Soranz, celebrated a desperately needed respite. “We’ve been through such painful, difficult months … this is now a moment of hope,” the 42-year-old doctor said last November as carioca life regained some semblance of normality, hospitals emptied and the city’s effervescent cultural scene was reborn.  But the new year, and the arrival of the highly contagious Omicron variant, has brought Soranz and many others crashing back down to Earth as coronavirus cases surge across Latin America with consequences that remain unclear. “It’s really tiring,” Soranz admitted this week as infections in his beachside city soared to their highest ever levels and plans for Rio’s rumbustious annual carnival were cast into doubt. “This pandemic has been going on for almost two years. It’s exhausting. But there’s nothing to be done,” Soranz said, noting how 20% of Rio’s health workers – about 5,000 people – had been infected since December. Similar angst is being voiced around South America, which, having witnessed some of the pandemic’s bleakest moments – with bodies dumped in mass graves and patients starved of oxygen in overwhelmed hospitals – had been enjoying a long-awaited moment of optimism after becoming one of the world vaccination champions. Nearly 65% of South Americans have been fully vaccinated, according to the University of Oxford’s Our World in Data project, compared with about 62% in Europe and the US, and less than 10% in Africa. So far Argentina seems to be the South American country worst hit by Omicron. Over the last week it registered over 50% of South America’s daily cases, with just 11% of its population, and had the world’s seventh-highest number of daily cases. Although cases are rising in a straight line from a daily average of about 2,400 a month ago to more than 130,000 now, authorities say they are not unduly worried. Their assumption is that Covid has become an endemic disease and vaccination is the only necessary safeguard. The government is relaxing restrictions even more than last September when restaurants, football matches and entertainment venues reopened after a sharp dip in cases, and the outdoor mask mandate was lifted. “In the evolution of the disease you can see that it is really like chickenpox, the flu or that type of disease. The transition to the endemic will no longer require testing all cases and the role of isolation will change,” the health minister, Carla Vizzotti, told journalists on Tuesday. Health official Sandra Tirado predicted cases could begin to fall in the next two weeks and pointed to Córdoba province where Omicron infections were already coming down. Arnaldo Dubin, an ICU doctor at a private Buenos Aires hospital, said he had deep misgivings about Argentina’s Covid policy and believed mask mandates had to return. “It’s horrifying. You have a very serious Covid situation that is paradoxically simultaneous with a total relaxation of safeguards.” Peru, which has one of the world’s worst per-capita death tolls, is also suffering, with more confirmed infections in the first week of January than during its ferocious second wave in early 2021. Other South American countries including Bolivia, Guyana and Uruguay have also seen infections jump while further north, Omicron appears to be rattling Mexico. On Saturday, a record 30,671 coronavirus cases were registered. On Monday, Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, announced he had tested positive for the second time in a year and was isolating. “I think it’s the flu,” López Obrador, whose dismissive handling of the pandemic has been criticised, had told a press conference earlier in the day. He appeared without a mask despite admitting feeling hoarse. Brazil, which was already facing a major influenza outbreak, is also under pressure although a statistics blackout apparently caused by a hacking attack on the health ministry is hampering efforts to track the surge. Isaac Schrarstzhaupt, a data scientist who monitors Covid statistics, said Brazil was clearly careening into a new wave, with states such as Rio Grande do Sul and São Paulo seeing a “vertiginous increase” in infections similar to that in Europe. “But [because of the blackout] we don’t know the scale of it and I fear we’ll only understand when hospitals start raising their hands to say: ‘Hey, we’re in trouble over here.’” Schrarstzhaupt warned: “Even if there’s a 95% reduction in severe cases, if we hit one million cases a day like the US, the remaining 5% will still be a very big number.” Rio’s health secretary said there was no doubt Omicron was driving a major Covid outbreak there. It had taken Omicron just 17 days to become Rio’s dominant variant, responsible for more than 98% of cases. Previous variants took more than 45 days to do the same. Soranz voiced apprehension about the coming days and could not confirm February’s carnival would go ahead. However, high vaccination levels seemed to be helping prevent a more dramatic crisis – as appears also to be the case in neighbours such as Peru and Argentina, and European countries such as Portugal. Ninety-six per cent of Rio’s adults have been double jabbed and 32% boosted. Soranz said 13 Covid patients were admitted on Sunday: 11 unvaccinated and two with only one shot. “There’s no way to predict what’s going to happen – but we can see it’s spreading much faster and that this is not being accompanied by severe cases or fatalities,” Soranz said, before adding a word of caution: “This could change.”",News/World news,Omicron dims optimism as South America enters pandemic’s third year,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/12/south-america-covid-omicron-brazil-argentina
1/12/2022,"While many expect to see rows of bright flowers and pillowy blossoms at the Chelsea flower show, this year star gardens will also feature such biodiverse elements as fungi and a beaver habitat. Garden designers at the annual Royal Horticulture Society (RHS) show have been asked to consider the environment when making their entries.  Though many of the traditional aspects of the show, including the prize flowers in the Great Pavilion, remain, many gardens focus on nature rather than conventional manicured beauty. For the first time, the gardening power of beavers will be displayed at the show. The Rewilding Britain Landscape garden, by the designers Lulu Urquhart and Adam Hunt, will demonstrate how the rodents tend the landscape and let biodiversity thrive. Beavers became extinct in the UK 400 years ago, and only in recent years have they been reintroduced to parts of the country. Their garden will show naturally rewilded landscape in the south-west of England, with the designers saying they will be “showing the role of beavers as incredible bioengineers within a natural ecosystem.” It will feature a beaver dam, and a pool with a lodge behind, and show off a “riparian meadow” of the sort beavers create when they partially flood a riverbank and attract pollinators and other wildlife. The pair said: “The inspiration for the garden comes from seeing the incredible abundance, diversity and beauty that comes from the presence of beavers, a mammal once lost to the British landscape and now reintroduced.” Favourite trees of beavers, including hazel and field maples, have been chosen for the garden, as well as native wildflowers and plants that encourage and support trees such as hawthorn and alder, which provide winter food for many birds and support dozens of insect species. Rather than flowers, the designer Joe Perkins has decided to show off a range of fungi to highlight the “inseparable connection between plants and fungi within woodland ecosystems”. In between buying new roses and water features for their gardens, attenders will learn about the complex mycelium networks that connect and support woodland life, in the exhibit that will make use of trees including sweet chestnut and Douglas fir. The garden will also include species that are used to warmer climates, to highlight how our planting may have to change as a result of a warming planet. While most at the show, to be held in May in the grounds of the Royal hospital, Chelsea, usually focus on what grows in the soil, the dirt itself is the star of the new Blue Peter garden. The designer, Juliet Sergeant, is hoping to “open the eyes of children and adults to the role of soil in supporting life and its potential to help in our fight against climate change”. The garden will feature a subterranean chamber, which will show a soil animation, and soil-themed art by the children of Salford. It also features a roof-top meadow and barley field with common spotted and southern marsh orchids and a two-tonne tree on the planted roof, showing the wide variety of plants that good healthy soil can sustain. Also at the show is a foraging garden by Howard Miller, for the Alder Hey children’s hospital. The garden features a movable foraging kitchen and is designed to help children engage in nature through foraging, sharing healthy food, play, relaxing together and being in the moment. The garden will heavily feature heather and bilberries. Miller said: “One of my favourite childhood memories is going to pick bilberries with my grandparents, My grandpa Harold had a habit of counting 1,000 bilberries into a bag before he would allow himself to talk to us. My grandma Mary and I would sit and eat the bilberries while he wasn’t looking. “The smell of sitting in among heather and bilberries just transports me to that moment. So the takeaway I would like people to have is to give foraging a try, it’s free, it’s good for the soul and it’s a great excuse to connect with nature and each other.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Chelsea flower show to feature planet-friendly garden designs,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/12/chelsea-flower-show-feature-planet-friendly-garden-designs
1/12/2022,"The US postmaster general, Louis DeJoy, has drawn criticism over changes made to the US Postal Service since Donald Trump appointed him in May 2020, which have included delays in services, cuts and consolidation efforts, along with financial conflicts of interest. These changes have continued into the Biden administration amid calls from unions, some elected officials, and progressive groups to oust DeJoy from his position, especially as in the pandemic, postal votes have become increasingly common and a core part of America’s democratic systems.  In March 2021, the USPS unveiled a 10-year austerity plan to improve the financial sustainability of the postal service, which includes implementing longer delivery windows, cuts to branch hours, consolidation and shutdowns of branches and facilities, and postage rate increases. As well as fears over the efficacy of postal voting, the move has raised concerns over impacts on low-income Americans, rural communities and small businesses that rely on these services. “The 10-year plan is a plan for privatization. It just doesn’t use the ‘p’ word,” said Porter McConnell, co-founder of the Save the Post Office Coalition. “It’s already happening. I think what they’ve discovered is that you can privatize without talking about it.” The 1970 Postal Reorganization Act reorganized the USPS into a businesslike organization designed to rely on self-funding through revenue. A 2006 law mandated the USPS pre-fund health benefits for all retirees 75 years into the future, which has contributed significantly to financial troubles for the agency, which receives no government appropriations, unlike other government agencies. “I think the reorganization of the postal service into something that both has a universal service obligation and has to break even was setting them up to fail,” added McConnell. “I don’t think we should be apologetic about a government service being provided where as a democracy it’s not in our best interest to have people in rural Alaska, for example, not be able to get mail service.” As part of the 10-year plan, 18 mail processing facilities around the US were listed for closure in 2021, with plans to consolidate them into other regional cities. In Cape Girardeau, Missouri, postal workers have held informational pickets to raise public awareness in opposition to the closures and consolidations, citing the impacts on workers and degradation in services as a result. The mail processing facility in Cape Girardeau is expected to shut down and be moved to St Louis next month. Greg Davidson, president of American Postal Workers Union (APWU) Local 4088, explained the union had fought plans to consolidate all mail sorting operations to St Louis since 2011. “All of these consolidations, they weren’t anywhere near as successful as what they would say. I would say they were actually disastrous,” said Davidson. “The mail has slowed down. They reduced the service standards.” An audit by the USPS inspector general in 2018 found that slowing mail delivery in 2016 and 2017 resulted in just 5% of the savings the delays were projected to result in, and Davidson argued the decline in services resulted in lost revenue due to customers having to rely on different services because of the delays and consolidations resulting in mis-sorted mail. Davidson said workers had already erroneously received truckloads of mail sent from the St Louis processing center to Cape Girardeau, resulting in delayed deliveries. He anticipates the issues worsening as 31 jobs are set to be eliminated with the mail processing consolidation. Yet as service declines, prices have risen. In August 2021, the USPS implemented rate hikes of 6.8% for regular, first-class mail, 8.8% for package services, and a three-cent increase for a standard stamp. Starting on 9 January 2022, additional price hikes were implemented for priority mail services as part of the USPS 10-year plan. The price increases have been criticized by union leaders as part of the postal service’s shift toward operating as a business rather than a public service, to the detriment of the public. Kimberly Karol, president of the APWU in Iowa, says the increased reliance on private companies to handle mail parcels has led to delays in deliveries, with mail tracking disappearing for periods of time. “This is the closest that we’ve ever come to actually being privatized,” said Karol. “We do everything we possibly can to make sure people get the mail in the way that they are expecting. The plans and the rules that are being put in place are making that nearly impossible for us to do any more and it’s heartbreaking. I’ve been with the postal service for 30 years. That’s a hard thing for us to come to terms with.” In November, the Biden administration nominated two members to join the Postal Service’s board of governors, which has the authority to remove DeJoy from his position as postmaster general. Biden previously appointed three members to the board, while the remaining four were appointed by Trump. Organizers successfully fought to prevent the Biden administration from reappointing Ron Bloom, a key ally of DeJoy, to the board. Jamie Partridge, a retired letter carrier and organizer with Communities and Postal Workers United in Portland, Oregon, emphasized actions had been taken to push current members of the board to oppose DeJoy and the 10-year plan. Advocates for DeJoy’s removal are adamant removing him is necessary to steer the USPS toward reforms required to strengthen the public agency. “Currently I feel like we have some momentum, with the possibility of gaining the majority that is against DeJoy and the 10-year plan, but there’s no guarantee of that,” Partridge said.",News/Business,The fight to oust Louis DeJoy and his ‘disastrous’ austerity plan,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/12/fight-louis-dejoy-austerity-plan
1/12/2022,"It was towards the end of his interview for a place at the prestigious Britannia Royal Naval College that Craig Jones was asked if he had ever had contact with homosexuals. No, he said, he had never knowingly met a homosexual in his life. Then, for good measure, “I said something like: ‘If I saw anybody who was gay, I’d walk in the opposite direction.’” He looks ashamed. “I was only young,” he says. Back in 1987, there was a ban on gay, bisexual and trans people joining Britain’s armed forces. Jones, then 20, was telling the naval officers what they wanted to hear. But he was also telling the truth. He had no sexual experience, had never been in a relationship and was an unworldly, small-town Yorkshire lad. About to finish a degree in economics at Portsmouth polytechnic, he had only one ambition: to join the navy as an officer. Jones impressed the interview board and won a place on an elite fast-tracking course, which he deferred for a year.  Then, a few weeks after the interview, he passed a newsagent and a magazine caught his eye. He went in and bought the Radio Times, which featured the singer Michael Ball on its cover. He took the magazine home, looked hard at the picture and panicked. “I thought: ‘Fuck, I bought that because I fancy him, and therefore I’m gay.’ That was a massive complication when I was about to join the navy. I walked through the gates of Britannia Royal Navy College at 15.45pm on 12 September 1989 and left part of me behind. The bit of me that was acceptable to them carried on up the hill.” Jones, who is speaking via Zoom from his home in Brighton, recalls times and dates with military precision. Despite rising to the rank of lieutenant commander, he was forced to live a secret life. He went on to have a successful career in the Royal Navy – but not as successful as it could have been. Over the past 21 years, since the ban on gay personnel was repealed, he has campaigned vociferously for gay rights in the armed forces - damaging his own advancement in the process. Last week, the home secretary, Priti Patel, announced that all convictions for consensual homosexual activity will be wiped from the records. A further announcement is expected in the next few days about people criminalised or forced out of the military because of their sexuality. Some were stripped of pensions and medals, some ended up homeless and impoverished, and some were imprisoned for a variety of offences, including breaching the Sexual Offences Act. As Jones is quick to point out, he could have easily gone the same way. “In the 80s and 90s, admirals and generals would repeatedly say: ‘We don’t want to serve with these people. These people have standards that are different to those we have in the armed forces. They would damage operational effectiveness, they would cause discord at the frontline, they would make us less competent as a nation at war fighting.’” He pauses. “A bit crazy, but that was what the thought was.” Jones, a youthful 53-year-old, has the bearing of an ex-naval officer – a polished smartness, and hair swept immaculately to the side. He was born in Bingley, five miles from Bradford, to a dinner-lady mother and a father who was a storeman at Bradford University. His uncle had served in the navy as a radio operator in Ceylon, now Sri Lanka, and was revered in the family. Jones wanted to follow suit from a young age. At 21, he joined the navy as a sub-lieutenant and was subsequently promoted to lieutenant and lieutenant commander. He was involved in interdiction operations to disrupt the cocaine trade from South America to North America, and retrained as a helicopter fast-rope incursions officer (which involved surprising targets by landing on them with an armed team). He was deployed to the northern Gulf in 1993, after the Gulf war, to check vessels for bombs, guns and contraband. For Jones, it was an exhilarating and purposeful life. In 1994, back in Britain, he found himself working as a patrol officer in South Down, Northern Ireland, performing armed boarding operations on vessels suspected of smuggling fertiliser bombs to mainland Britain. One day, he had an epiphany. On patrol with a police sergeant, they spotted what appeared to be an unmanned fishing boat in the middle of the sea. “We got on board and it was silent. I said to the sergeant: ‘This isn’t right, I’m not comfortable.’ So we drew our pistols and he very bravely said: ‘You look down the hatch, boss, and I’ll cover you.’ So I looked down the hatch and saw two older teenage lads lying on a mattress in each other’s arms. At the time, the age of consent in Northern Ireland was 21, so it was an illegal act.” Jones discreetly gave the young men time to dress, beckoned them to come to the top of the hatch, and told the sergeant there was nothing suspicious below deck. “It was the first time I had any notion that I was part of anything bigger – a gay community – and it was instinctive to protect them.” A few weeks later, he returned to England. “That night, I walked into my first gay bar and sat next to the man who would become my husband and partner of the past 27 years.” He laughs. “I think I bring remarkable military efficiency to dating!” Jones was 26; Adam was 19 and working as a coffee shop assistant at Tesco. This brought another set of problems. Now he didn’t just have to hide his sexuality, he had to hide his partner and their lifestyle. “When we met in 1995, if we’d been caught, I’d have been arrested and sent to prison for six months for the criminal offence of homosexuality.” The year before, Jones had been appointed navigator on HMS Sheffield – a dream job for him. But, 48 hours before he was due to sail from Plymouth, Adam’s father died suddenly. Jones knew he had to be with Adam, but he was unable to leave the ship. He ended up having a breakdown on board that resulted in 10 weeks’ leave. He couldn’t tell his seniors what had happened, so he said he had suffered a crisis of confidence in navigating. Not surprisingly, this proved to be a professional setback. Throughout his career, Jones expected a tap on the shoulder. Every time he came ashore, he feared the military police would be waiting to arrest him. “You didn’t know if somebody had seen you with your boyfriend or just made a false accusation. It was a toxic environment and people were actively encouraged to report those who might be gay.” On one occasion, when a colleague visited, he had to “de-gay” their home. “I had a signed Shirley Bassey poster in the hall, and I thought: ‘Jesus, get that down.’ I had a picture of a warship somewhere so I shoved that up on the wall instead.” He created aliases for friends in his address book. “On one page is George and Joan. Well, George and Joan are actually George and John. My whole address book was adjusted like that, in case anyone found anything.” Some people confessed to being gay under duress, he says. “They had been interrogated for days [by Royal Military Police]. Some had been spat at and pushed around, and then somebody said: ‘You can go on leave for a week if you sign this form,’ and they signed confessions.” Today, Jones is in touch with three of 17 former lifeguards who were sacked for being gay in a single day, in the 1970s. “One of them is gay, two are straight. What a sad waste of brilliant careers.” By 1999, he’d had enough. He applied for a job as principal warfare officer on HMS Fearless, a role that involved working with special intelligence. The job required high-level security clearance: he knew he would be vigorously vetted and his relationship with Adam would be detected – they shared bank accounts, had a joint mortgage and were on the electoral register at the same address. Astonishingly, he got the job. “The lieutenant colonel interviewing me leaned forward and said: ‘Just before you go, I haven’t spoken to you about homosexuality but, based on the answers you’ve given me, I don’t believe it’s something I need to worry about, is it?’ And I thought: ‘You don’t need to worry about it. I’m quite a happy homosexual,’ so I said: ‘No sir, I don’t think so,’ and he shook my hand and I left.” A year later, a signals telegram came in with a security classification. It stated that the gay ban was to be lifted because it had been found to be unlawful by the European court of human rights. After the captain had announced to the ship’s company that the ban would be revoked, Jones went to his office and said his bit. “I told the captain that this was a day when, finally, our values would match those which we defend. He said very little.” In some ways, Jones says, it was comic. There was disquiet when he said Adam would be his plus one at the navy’s Burns Night party a few days later. “I think they thought he might come in a feather boa.” Did anyone else come out at the same time? “No. Did they hell. The fact that the ops officer – me – had come out didn’t just go around my ship quickly, it went around the whole damned fleet. For the first four years after the ban was lifted, very few people came out – and if they did, it was done quietly.” From then on, Jones fought ceaselessly for gay rights. He wrote a paper in 2000 suggesting the Royal Navy joined Stonewall’s Diversity Champions scheme (the employers’ programme for ensuring all LGBTQ+ staff are free to be themselves in the workplace), that they marched and recruited at Pride, and that education programmes were introduced to ameliorate the impact of the former ban. “It went to the Royal Navy’s head of personnel and I got a reply saying: ‘Homosexuality is a private matter for the individual and not something for the service to be involved with.’” Jones kept writing to admirals and ministers saying it was not enough to revoke the ban; LGBTQ+ people had to be welcomed in the military. “I got letters back from admirals saying: ‘Please stop doing this.’” On one occasion, he gatecrashed a senior conference on inclusion to announce to all present, including the second sea lord (the head of personnel in the navy), that the failure to embrace LGBTQ+ personnel was “a catastrophic breach of the armed forces covenant”. He smiles at the memory. “The second sea lord had a face like thunder.” Did he ever feel he should have spoken up earlier, when the ban was still in place? “So many things were fundamentally wrong, but I couldn’t do anything about it except wreck my career. I’m pleased I didn’t leave because, if I had, I wouldn’t have had the opportunity to enable changes that have made our armed forces the best in the world at LGBTQ+ inclusion, which is amazing.” In 2005, the Royal Navy became the first armed service to sign up to the Diversity Champions programme and, a year later, became the first armed service to march at Pride. Was life better for Jones, professionally, once he came out? Anything but, he says. “I felt there was a spotlight on everything I did. There was nobody else who was trying to be out and proud. So it was really tough. Whenever I went into an officer’s mess that wasn’t mine, eyes would follow me round the table. I’d stop conversations at lunch – people would put their knives and forks down as I walked past. There weren’t many friends who would stand next to me at the bar. If you were a career person, I wasn’t someone to stand next to.” In 2006, he won an OBE for services to equality and human rights in the armed forces, and two years later, he quit the navy. Why did he leave? “My career had been damaged by the campaign to achieve change. I was a lone wolf, a very vocal protagonist of change, and it had an enduring impact on my career. And my work was done. Sometimes, the person who kicks the door down isn’t the person who sits at the table and I’m fine with that. I’d achieved what I was passionate about.” Jones went on to become head of equality and diversity for Barclays, then set up an organisation with Adam (now a psychologist) dedicated to moving people with severe mental health problems from low secure units back into the community. But he felt that victims of the ban still hadn’t seen justice and, last year (20 years after the ban was lifted), he founded the charity Fighting With Pride to campaign for those who had been hounded out of the military and criminalised for being LGBTQ+ (or for others thinking they were). “There are thousands of people who are financially impoverished, with health and wellbeing issues, broken careers and criminal records,” he says. Jones is now confident that the armed forces are ready to acknowledge the harm that was done, and to compensate victims fittingly. What has delighted him is that, after many years, the veterans community has now offered its support. “The people who I speak to every week are really struggling. I speak to people who are not living the lives our veterans should live. And this is an unremedied disgrace.” How important has the fight for justice been to him? “It’s in my DNA,” he says. “I’ll be here till it’s done.”",News/Society,Craig Jones: the naval officer who risked his career by coming out – then fought ceaselessly for gay rights,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/12/craig-jones-the-naval-officer-who-risked-his-career-by-coming-out-then-fought-ceaselessly-for-gay-rights
1/12/2022,"We found out last February that Tom Brady can win a shiny Vince Lombardi Trophy without any help from Bill Belichick. Now comes Part II: Can Belichick win one without Brady? The bookies don’t think so, at least not this year. Oddsmakers have set the New England Patriots’ price on winning the Super Bowl at 18-1, joint-eighth with Cincinnati among the 14 playoff teams. (Green Bay are favorites at 7-2. The Steelers are the longest shots at 80-1.)  New England are four-point underdogs against their wild-card weekend opponents, the Buffalo Bills. But the Patriots are back in the playoffs after a year away, and Belichick, their longtime coach, sounds as if he is up for the challenge – by clamming up, of course. Belichick needed an efficient 208 words over four minutes to answer seven questions Monday about the Bills, the AFC East rivals whom his Patriots will face Saturday night on the road. He was not grouchy, but succinct. Just got it done. “We have a lot to get ready for,” Belichick said Monday of the Bills. As always, he could have been talking about any opponent. So much has happened since Belichick and his quarterback, Brady, made the 2019 playoffs only to lose at home to Tennessee in the first round. Brady won his seventh Super Bowl in his first season with the Tampa Bay Bucs, and has had a second impressive season. The Patriots went 7-9 in 2020 with quarterback Cam Newton, whom Belichick decided to scuttle in favor of Mac Jones, the rookie from Alabama who has been a pleasant surprise this season, throwing for 3,801 yards, with 22 touchdowns versus 13 interceptions. A month ago, the Patriots were on a roll. They’d won seven in a row to improve their record to 9-5, including a 14-10 victory at Buffalo that was a Belichick masterstroke. It was blustery, so the Patriots threw the ball just three times, gaining just 19 yards, but ran it 46 times, gaining 222 yards and keeping the ball from the dangerous Buffalo quarterback Josh Allen. After a bye week, however, the Patriots finished the regular season with three losses in four games, including a 33-24 loss Sunday to the Miami Dolphins (9-8). A day later, the Dolphins fired coach Brian Flores, who’d been an assistant to Belichick for 11 years. It was a discouraging loss for the Patriots, who could have won the AFC East with a victory over the Dolphins (9-8) and a loss by Buffalo (11-5) to the Jets (4-13). The slide is similar to what happened two years ago, when New England were 10-1 but lost four of their last six. New England’s current slide includes a 33-21 loss at home to Buffalo just three weeks after the Patriots’ victory over the Bills. Jones did not play so well, completing only 14 of 32 passes with two interceptions. Naturally, people wondered if Jones had hit a “rookie wall”. Belichick is 69 years old and has done it all as a football coach – including, as his many detractors in New York will point out, suspiciously resigning as “the HC of the NYJ” and spying on, um, the Jets. Don’t forget Brady, as a Patriot, was busted for deflating footballs. Nevertheless, both are still relevant, nearly two full decades after they led the Patriots to their first Super Bowl victory. (Here is how long ago that was: That was the first Super Bowl to be played in February, because the 2001 schedule had been pushed back because of 9/11). Belichick and Brady have even gotten the Head-to-Head Matchup out of the way. That came in October, when Brady traveled back to Foxboro and beat the Patriots, 19-17, on a field goal with less than two minutes to play. But Jones kept pace with Brady all afternoon. The week leading up to that game included the two chief combatants saying all sorts of nice things about each other. At one point, Belichick said of Brady’s longevity: “Nothing Tom does surprises me. He’s a great player. Works hard and takes care of himself. I mean, he’s talking about playing until 50. If anybody can do it, he probably can.” Belichick would never, ever, say that he wants to see what he can accomplish without Brady – he might not even be thinking such a thing – but there is no denying that the two men will forever be linked. Plus, the Patriots missed Brady more than he missed them in 2020. New England and Tampa Bay would not meet in the playoffs until the Super Bowl, anyway. The two teams will chart parallel routes for a month, and, besides that, neither team is expected to even make it so far. The Patriots might not get out of the first weekend. Jones labeled the way he played against the Dolphins as “super embarrassing”, even though he completed all nine of his fourth-quarter passes for 121 yards. The Patriots had a chance to win the game until their final play went haywire, resulting in a Miami touchdown. “Obviously played poorly, coached poorly, didn’t do anything very well,” Belichick said while wearing a mask with the state flag of Maryland, where he grew up. “So just too many – too many mistakes, way too many. So we’ll go look at the film, turn the page here and make some corrections and move on to next week. So that’s really about it.” A day later, he was reluctant to talk about a third game against Buffalo, saying that the coaching staff was still reviewing the loss to the Dolphins. The Bills have won four games in a row after a 33-21 loss on 12 December to, yes, Brady and the Bucs. Asked what he’d tell his players who’d be playing in their first playoff game, Belichick responded: “Try to play and coach well. It’s a one-game season. It’s no big mystery.” The key part is that it is no big mystery to Belichick. This will be his 44th playoff game as an NFL head coach. His teams lost only 11 of the first 43. Belichick said Monday, “I don’t think we lack confidence.” That must be why Ty Law, the Patriots’ Hall of Fame cornerback, told Boston.com: “I’m going with Bill Belichick for one game.” And if Belichick wins one playoff game, his team can certainly win three – or even four. There is no dominant team in the playoffs, not even that team with his old quarterback. Bet against the coach in the hoodie, if you dare.",Sport/Sport,Brady won it all without Belichick.

1/12/2022,"In the winter of 1996, I almost lost my job because of the acclaimed management sim Civilization II. I was supposed to be reviewing it for the video game magazine Edge, where I was a fledgling staff writer. But I got so hooked, playing it was all I did for three weeks. During that period I ate, slept and drank Civilization II. At the end, I handed in my extremely thorough two-page review: the only thing I had submitted for the entire issue. I was supposed to be writing 25 pages a month. My editor was … displeased. On Saturday evening, video game publisher Techland proudly tweeted that if players hoped to fully complete its forthcoming apocalyptic adventure Dying Light 2, they would need around 500 hours – “almost as long as it would take you to walk from Warsaw to Madrid”. The message immediately provoked a storm of controversy. Many respondents were critical, complaining that there wasn’t a chance they’d be able to find enough time for such a challenge. Writer Andy Kelly summed up it up by tweeting: “How not to market a game to anyone over 30 years old.”  To fully complete Dying Light 2 Stay Human, you'll need at least 500 hours—almost as long as it would take to walk from Warsaw to Madrid!#DyingLight2 #stayhuman pic.twitter.com/Sk3KFpRJoA For players with demanding jobs, families and other interests, the prospect of having to put aside 500 hours to finish a game about slaughtering zombies seemed too exhausting to contemplate. Other commentators saw it as a symbol of unhealthy games industry practices, in which developers burn themselves out through years of crunch to deliver gigantic games, setting impossibly high targets – only for the game to fall short, requiring months of bug-chasing. “Easily the most toxic and damaging way to market and set expectations for video games,” tweeted Luke Plunkett of games site Kotaku. “Well done to everyone involved.” Techland immediately clarified its original post. “Note: It’s about 100% completion rate,” the company explained, giving an estimate of 80-100 hours for most players to finish the main story and all the side-quests. But by then the 500-hour figure had stuck. The thing is, as my Civilization experience taught me, there are many players who do value spending many hundreds of hours with a game, immersing themselves in the world and its community for months or even years. In your teens and 20s, when you have few responsibilities, absolutely burying yourself in a sprawling adventure is a genuine treat, like getting lost in a vast fantasy novel. Nowadays, games such as Minecraft and Fortnite completely lack definitive endings and are more like social platforms than games; a huge percentage of fans will be spending thousands of hours in those virtual getaways. Ask players what games (or series) they’ve spent the most time on, and the answers range from endless multiplayer sci-fi shooter Destiny to the 16-year-old multiplayer RPG World of Warcraft to Fifa. Other players are just fundamentally not willing or capable of playing a single game for such a long time. “Ever since I was a kid I’ve always played games until I’ve either finished the story or gotten bored, and then moved on,” says the Guardian’s games editor Keza MacDonald. “I almost never replay a game, either – I know a lot of people who’ve gone through a huge RPG like Skyrim three or four times, but I’ve never been able to see the point. Even if I didn’t have small children, I’d be a 10 to 20-hour kind of player, and I find the continual expansion of playtimes in modern games to be pretty exhausting. An Assassin’s Creed game used to take you 30 hours; now it’s more like 100 and I always bail before the end. “There are a few exceptions, though. If you added up all the hours I’ve spent over the course of my life playing various versions of Guitar Hero, Tetris, Animal Crossing or Monster Hunter, you’d definitely end up in the hundreds.” The most important thing, when it comes to investing so much time into a game, is what you get out of it. “The most wholesome I’ve felt about having played a game for a long time would be The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,” says game designer Sam Barlow. “My save file for that game is in the hundreds of hours. Unlike games that pad out their game time with filler content and arduous checklists, Breath of the Wild is a game I’ve spent so much time in because of the simple joy of walking in its world, exploring without the pressures of busywork. It’s a game that my kids and I like to return to just to hang out in and enjoy on a sensory level. If from time to time we come across one of the many [collectible] Korok seeds we’ve yet to stumble across, fine, but that’s not why we’re there.” Whether it’s time with friends or constant new discoveries, if a game (or indeed anything) is going to ask for hundreds of your precious hours on this Earth, it’s got to be giving you something you really enjoy. Have you ever spent that long with a video game? And more importantly, did it feel like time well spent?",Arts/Games,Would you play a video game for 500 hours?,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/12/would-you-play-a-video-game-for-500-hours
1/12/2022,"Dusan Vlahovic is becoming almost as permanent a part of the Mill’s machinery as Erling Haaland and the latest breathless whispering has Arsenal persisting with their pursuit of the Fiorentina forward by running a player-plus-cash deal up the flagpole to see if the Serie A side are inclined to salute it. According to the Mirror, Arsenal have already waved £70m in I Viola’s faces to no avail – yet – but may instead offer them the midfielder Lucas Torreira plus £44m. Torreira is already at Fiorentina on loan so they wouldn’t need to waste time showing him the sights, but reports are that they would want Arsenal to bump up their cash offer by at least £7m. The Arsenal exit door is unlikely to go unpushed by strikers this month either, with Crystal Palace in talks to sign Eddie Nketiah, whose contract at the Emirates Stadium runs out this summer, and Folarin Balogun headed for Middlesbrough on loan until the end of the season to help out Chris Wilder’s promotion push.  Antonio Conte is evidently up for replacing people who leave the pitch slowly with those who zip along it at great speed, with Wolves’ Adama Traoré understood to be on Tottenham’s radar. The Spanish wide man is valued at £20m by Wolves, a deal that could be helped along by some departures. Roma appear to be at the front of the queue to snap up Tanguy Ndombele, with José Mourinho reported to have contacted the midfielder directly, while Matt Doherty and 2017’s Dele Alli could also be heading out on loan. Over in northern Italy, Milan’s desire for central defensive reinforcements could prompt a bid for Manchester United’s Eric Bailly while Paris Saint-Germain’s Senegal international Abdou Diallo is also a possible loan option for Stefano Pioli. You’ll be expecting some more Newcastle content I shouldn’t wonder, but today we must make do with the titbit that the Saudi-owned project have been linked with a bid to bring Georginio Wijnaldum back to Tyneside – but the PSG midfielder isn’t having any of it. A more realistic target for them is the teenage Reims striker Hugo Ekitike, whom they are favourites to land in a £30m deal, though Brentford and Brighton have entered the bidding with offers of around £20m for the 19-year-old. Everton and West Ham are sniffing around the Bournemouth defender Lloyd Kelly. The 23-year-old has been a mainstay for Scott Parker’s promotion-chasing side this season and the Cherries are keen to ward off suitors by demanding what an insider described as “silly money” for his services. And Memphis Depay is allegedly in talks with Atlético Madrid about a summer move to the Wanda Metropolitano from plucky, hard-up minnows Barcelona. Such are the harsh realities of the modern game that it’s harder for the smaller clubs to keep hold of their players. Barça are looking for €30m for the Dutch forward.",Sport/Football,Football transfer rumours: Arsenal to step up Dusan Vlahovic bid?,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/12/football-transfer-rumours-arsenal-to-step-up-dusan-vlahovic-bid
