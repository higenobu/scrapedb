3/6/2022,"Areas around Sydney and Newcastle are facing the renewed risk of flooding on Sunday and coming days, with the possibility that some rivers, including the Hawkesbury-Nepean, will exceed the major flood levels reached last week. The Bureau of Meteorology has several warnings out for severe weather on Sunday, including parts of the Sydney metro region, the South Coast, Illawarra, and parts of the Tablelands. The source of the latest rain is an upper level low that is moving slowly over northern NSW today, the bureau said. A surface trough off the NSW coast is expected to strengthen, dragging in moist south-easterly winds on to the areas of warning. Some heavy rain over Sydney this morning, and several days of persistent falls to come. Here are the Sunday and Monday forecast totals. @BOM_au pic.twitter.com/OKgWZ1prP3 For Sydney, it means days more of rain and the possibility of a severe thunderstorm on Sunday through to Tuesday. And Tuesday's forecast is also wet, bringing four-day totals to 100mm+ in areas that are already facing rising rivers. And there is a warning out this morning for heavy rain for parts of the central coast and inland: https://t.co/E0A4G0fr0O @BOM_au pic.twitter.com/ErPvxk5ZQg The Hunter region is another area of concern on Sunday onwards, with Singleton, Maitland and Newcastle facing moderate to major flooding.“We just want to make sure that communities there are aware of that and begin taking preparations as well,” Campbell said. People in parts of Picton were ordered to evacuate on Sunday as the Stonequarry Creek was rising quickly and could break its banks, he said. Towns along the Hawkesbury-Nepean River were already getting another soaking on Sunday, and the river was rising again. Hawkesbury River back above major flood level at North Richmond. Almost 120mm has already fallen at Richmond since 0900 Saturday, and earlier forecast had as much as 70mm on Sunday. More to come on Monday and Tuesday. @BOM_au pic.twitter.com/OmEI9bBLX7 “For those who are in low-lying areas out in western Sydney along the Hawkesbury we are looking at the potential of the rain forecast over the next couple of days for those river levels to rise again, possibly up to or even exceeding the level of a few days ago,” Campbell said. “That will just prolong for some people that flooding well into the coming week,” he said. “So it may well be that some communities and some properties will remain isolated or underwater for until next weekend.” One factor affecting the size of the flooding will be the spill rate at Warragamba Dam, Sydney’s main reservoir. It began spilling on Wednesday morning when the dam exceeded full capacity and has been spilling ever since. Meanwhile, the spill at Warragamba Dam has started rise as well. @BOM_NSW has earlier predicted 70-120mm at the site on Sunday, with 25-45mm on Monday, and 50-70mm on Tuesday. Inflows into Lake Burragorang are certain to rise again, it would seem. pic.twitter.com/YltAiKFleu As of Sunday morning, it was spilling at the rate of at least 130 gigalitres a day, with the pace expected to increase, the government said. Last week, the peak spill rate reached 315GL a day compared with more than 440GL/day during the March 2021 floods. The NSW SES has more than 500 volunteers in the field, backed up by many agencies. Volunteers have also joined from Victoria and Tasmania. In the past day, the SES conducted 17 flood rescues, including eight in the Sydney metro region.

3/6/2022,"In the minutes before England went out to warm-up for their match against Wales last Saturday, Eddie Jones gave the team a last pep talk. “This is the day, boys, where you can really put the team forward,” he told them. “And old England and new England come together.” Two hours later, they had won 23-19 but Jones, and everyone else, was still waiting for that performance he had spoken about. England are at an awkward stage, caught between the way they used to play and the way they want to, while Jones tries to blend a group of new young players with the survivors from the squad that lost the World Cup final in 2019. They have been working on it in Bristol this week on a three-day training camp at Clifton college, before their back-to-back matches against Ireland and France, the two best teams in the tournament. England have it in them to beat both but will have to play better than they have done. England cannot afford to keep waiting for that moment when everything clicks. “That’s definitely the vibe in the camp,” says Harry Randall. “We feel we’ve been very close, like in that first-half performance against Wales. On another day we could have scored two or three of those chances and then at half-time we’d be up by 20, 25 points. So we feel like we’re very nearly there.” England had more than 60% of the possession in the first half against Wales, just like they did when they lost to Scotland, but did not manage to score a try in either half. So a lot of the work now, Randall says, “is around what we do when we get into their 22 and we’re putting them under pressure, how can we be more clinical in that area.” Jones has been drilling them in this new “free-formation” attack, which in theory means that after the first couple of attacking phases, everything should be unpredictable and fluid, with the playmakers making spontaneous decisions, and runners swapping in and out of positions. But as Jones has said, that depends on the understanding between the scrum-half, the fly-half, the inside centre and the men around them, who all need to be able anticipate one another’s thinking and organise themselves accordingly in the split-seconds available. So far in this Six Nations, England have not seemed to have the confidence or cohesion to make it work. Randall believes it is coming. “The more you play with someone the better connection you have,” he says. “I’m really enjoying playing with Marcus [Smith]. We’re still learning a lot from playing with each other. It’s about building that partnership and connection on and off the field, because that 9-10 axis is very important to controlling the team. “I’ve played four games with him now, we’re slowly getting there game by game. Hopefully, we get the chance to play with each other more but training is probably the best place to keep on working at that connection. We sit down after and go through clips, talking to each other about what we both want. You get out what you put into it.” England fans will not necessarily thank him for it, but for Jones, all this is a bet on being ready by the next World Cup. You can hear him thinking about it in the way he has been talking. He has described these last three matches as a quarter-final, semi-final and final and is encouraging the players to think that way. Time is getting tight there, too, given how much team-building they still have to do. Smith is 23, Randall 24 and they have played 12 Tests between them. After these two games they have the summer tour to Australia and three autumn internationals, one more Six Nations and then into the World Cup warm-up matches. Which explains why Jones has finally decided to move Randall into the starting XV, when the position has belonged to Ben Youngs for the past four years. After 115 caps Jones knows exactly what he will get from Youngs: he is steady, accurate and does not make many bad decisions. Jones trusts him to run the game. But Randall offers the promise of something different, something a little more threatening, a little “zip-zip” Jones calls it. He brings a pace to the game and a threat around the breakdown the team have not really had in that position since Danny Care played his last game in the autumn of 2018. “I was delighted,” Randall says when asked how it felt to start against Wales, “but it doesn’t matter if I start, he starts, or Raffi Quirke comes in. Whoever it is we’ve got to do what’s best for the team.” Which might be true but they, and everyone else, need to grow into the new roles, with Youngs playing finisher, and “squadfather”, to the group, while Randall gets used to setting the tempo in the first hour of the match. Randall says they dovetail well. “We work together a lot, do a lot of passing and kicking, always learning off each other. Ben is the most-capped men’s international now so it’s pretty awesome to be learning off him. We’ve got a good relationship, we help each other out, we always talk and connect with each other about things. It’s good to bounce off each other and give each other ideas.” The idea is that one of these days all this study is going to have to pay off and England will spring forward. Jones will hope it is sooner rather than later.",Sport/Sport,Harry Randall hoping practice pays off as England aim to take final step,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/05/harry-randall-hoping-practice-pays-off-as-england-aim-to-take-final-step
3/6/2022,"Illegal billing by doctors and other health providers is rampant, with as few as three-in-10 patients being properly bulk-billed despite federal government claims that rates are close to 90%, the first comprehensive review of Medicare claiming and compliance has found. The review, authored by Dr Margaret Faux, found a primary cause of Medicare fraud was ignorance by healthcare providers, who do not comprehend the complex billing system and often have no idea they are not complying with regulations. Faux says the government is turning a “blind eye” to illegal billing and that the bulk-billing statistics presented by officials are a “lie”. “Bulk-billing statistics have become nothing more than a powerful gaslighting tool because they make us think we must be imagining out-of-pocket medical costs,” Faux said. “The more we continue to believe this lie, the more we are contributing to Medicare’s slow demise, and sending our own out-of-pocket costs further up.” The report on Faux’s findings have been sent to the auditor general’s office and the health minister. Faux said most of the time the illegal billing activity flies under the radar because very few people check their Medicare records, and even if they did, most would not understand what they see. A common example of illegal billing she sees is patients having to pay a fee, despite their records saying they were bulk-billed. “Many providers mistakenly believe that it is legal to bulk-bill, and charge a separate gap at the same time,” she said. “It’s not.” A spokesperson for the health minister Greg Hunt said bulk billing rates are at a record high – 88.8% for the 2020-2021 financial year. This is 6.7% higher than the same period in 2012-13 and means that nearly nine in 10 visits to the GP are free of charge. But Faux, who is chief executive of the Australian Institute of Medical Administration and Compliance, said government data shows patients are being bulk-billed even when they have not been, skewing the data. She said based on medical records she reviews daily and research for her thesis on the issue, “the actual level of legally correct bulk-billing for going to a doctor would be about 30%”. “There is massive illegal bulk-billing going on and I see it in every education seminar for doctors that I do,” Faux said. She said at a recent seminar on Medicare billing at least three questions asked by health practitioners “indicated very clearly that the practitioners were both bulk-billing and in addition charging a separate gap fee”. “One practitioner said that with the consent of the patient they are allowed to bulk-bill and charge an extra fee. I had to make it very clear to this person it is not open to them or anyone to reach an agreement with their patient to break the law and defraud the commonwealth government. “The government itself turns a blind eye to it.

She said in reality there should only be two billing options: bulk-billing, which means no other money can be taken from the patient, or the patient is charged a fee. But she said what often happens is people get told there is a private fee – such as $50 – and many walk out thinking that was the gap. “And they will never submit their claim to Medicare to get their rebate, which would be roughly $40,” she said, referencing the example of a $50 fee. “What should have happened was the patient paid a $50 private fee and got a $40 rebate from Medicare, leaving them out of pocket $10,” Faux said. She said the practice will then bulk-bill the claim and receive a rebate from government. And on the patient’s Medicare record it says the patient has been bulk-billed. “That appointment drops into the government’s bulk-billed statistics showing that the patient did not pay that day,” Faux said. “It completely distorts the statistics.” She said everyone should log in to Medicare and view their records, and look at the “cost to claimant” column. If a cost in that column says $0, but you paid for the service and were left out of pocket, something wrong had likely occurred, Faux said. “Ask yourself: ‘Did I pay money that day?’ Every single one of us, myself included, will likely have an example on their record where it says $0 but a gap was paid. “We all know we’re paying for health everywhere. But we’re being told we’re not.” Her research comes as the Grattan Institute on Sunday published a report that found Australia still relies heavily on patients contributing to the cost of their care. In 2019-20, Australians spent a total of nearly $7bn on out-of-hospital medical services and on medications listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, placing a burden in particular on patients with chronic diseases requiring regular medical appointments and medications. Specialist fees are a major cause of high out-of-pocket payments, the report led by health economist Prof Stephen Duckett found. But because fees are unregulated, private specialists often charge way above the Medicare schedule fee. “In 2019, half a million Australians spent on average about $450 on specialist services alone,” the report said. The Grattan report recommended the federal government fund bulk-billed specialist services in private clinics, as well as a national secondary consultations scheme so that GPs could get advice about patients directly from specialists to reduce the number of specialist referrals. The federal government should also eliminate out-of-pocket payments for diagnostic services by tendering for those services, the report also recommended. Faux said while out-of-pocket payments are a major concern, many of the solutions proposed in this Grattan report were not evidence based. She said key to reforming fees was first tackling the complex and opaque Medicare Benefits Schedule. “Medicare’s problems are deeply structural, and we now have evidence around what needs to be done across three domains – regulation, education and digitisation,” Faux said. “Many of the proposals in this report concerning solutions to medical fee problems, while well intentioned, are not evidence-based and are therefore unlikely to succeed.”",News/Australia news,"Medicare fraud by providers is rampant and government bulk-billing figures are a ‘lie’, review finds",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/06/medicare-by-providers-is-rampant-and-government-bulk-billing-figures-are-a-lie-review-finds
