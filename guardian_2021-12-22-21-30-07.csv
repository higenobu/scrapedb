12/22/2021,"Mikel Arteta has urged the government not to put football back behind closed doors, saying it is a “different sport” when fans are not present and that the game’s essence gets lost. Matches in Wales will take place without spectators over the Christmas period and Scottish stadiums will be reduced to capacities of 500. As things stand, though, English venues can host full houses despite the spread of the Omicron variant of Covid-19. Arteta hopes it can stay that way, although his view on the situation is nuanced and he has serious concerns about the schedule clubs are being asked to undertake over the coming days.  Asked what he would say about stadiums being closed to fans, the Arsenal manager responded: “Please don’t go back to that stage, because we have experienced that and it’s something we don’t like so hopefully it’s not what happens. It’s a different sport. Football is all about sharing it with people and having fans around the stadiums and when it is not, it is a completely different sport and the competition gets lost. “It is not the same … Obviously nobody wants to go back to where we were because we’ve already experienced it and it’s not something we enjoyed a lot, but if we have to carry on doing that, of course we will.” Arteta had been in favour of postponing a fixture from the Christmas schedule to give breathing space at a time when the pandemic has stretched some squads, not to mention the public health situation, to the limit. That idea was rejected at a Premier League meeting on Monday so Arsenal, who currently have Albert Sambi Lokonga, Pablo Marí and Callum Chambers unavailable after testing positive, will play Norwich, Wolves and Manchester City in the space of seven days. “The clubs have decided and that’s the decision that they’ve made, so we have to carry on,” Arteta said. “Obviously, we had a preference of what we wanted to do because of the schedule and because of the situation that we are in, but it didn’t stop so now we have to play, if we can, every single match with no recovery and with [fewer] numbers, but we will try to do our best.” Arteta was asked about comments from Jordan Henderson, the Liverpool captain, that “nobody really takes player welfare seriously” and said footballers’ views must count for more. “They’ve always tried to carry on and try to get this league to the highest standard, and when they start to say something like that, I think we have to really, really listen with open ears because we don’t want to damage the product and the incredible league that we have,” Arteta said.",Sport/Football,Arsenal’s Mikel Arteta desperate for games in England to continue with fans,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/22/arsenal-mikel-arteta-desperate-for-games-in-england-to-continue-with-fans

12/22/2021,"It’s beginning to feel a lot like last Christmas. Case numbers of a new Covid variant are exploding across the UK, and the prime minister is cautioning that restrictions may be called for. But while the threat of Omicron likely surpasses that of previous variants, our tools to track and combat the virus have also advanced since last year. The world was alerted to Omicron by the Botswanan and South African scientists who first sequenced the novel variant on 24 November, and it was designated as a variant of concern by the World Health Organization two days later. It was immediately obvious to them that they had something alarming on their hands when they saw the large number of mutations in the Omicron genome.  More than 20 mutations differentiate Omicron from Delta, the variant that has dominated the pandemic since the summer of 2021. And many of those mutations are in sites that change the way the virus interacts with our immune system or that increase transmissibility. Those scientists realised the mutations meant the new variant would be likely to infect people who had been vaccinated and might even reinfect people who’d already had Covid-19. And Covid-19 cases were rising rapidly in the Gauteng province of South Africa. Because of all these mutations, Omicron sits at the end of a long branch in the Covid-19 family tree – like a rather strange-looking cousin who doesn’t seem to fit in with the rest of the family. There are three possible explanations as to where this variant might have come from and how it has managed to accumulate so many mutations while remaining hidden. It might have evolved in a part of the world that does little virus sequencing – sequencing inequity means that we are missing early opportunities to detect new variants from many places. Or it might have arisen after a human infected an animal population, allowing the virus to mutate in a new environment unmonitored, and then be transmitted back to us. Or, most likely, the variant may have come from a chronically infected Covid-19 patient with a suppressed immune system – a person living with HIV, for example, or a patient undergoing cancer treatment. Such a situation would allow the virus to accumulate mutations without being challenged by a normal immune response. The Alpha variant that ravaged the UK last Christmas is thought to have evolved within a chronically infected patient. The first Omicron infection in the UK was reported on 27 November, just a few days after the variant was first identified in Africa. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) and the Covid-19 Genomics UK (Cog-UK) consortium have been tracking Covid-19 genomes since the beginning of the pandemic. A regular PCR test doesn’t read the entire genetic sequence of the virus, so a proportion of all Covid-19 diagnoses are fully sequenced so as to spot worrying mutations and identify variants of concern, allowing us to track how the virus is spreading and evolving, in order to inform policy. This has served us well throughout the pandemic. As soon as Alpha was identified in December 2020, analyses comparing its spread to previous variants showed it was far more transmissible. It was clear that the restrictions already in place against other variants were insufficient to stall the spread of Alpha, and this finding led to the third national lockdown in January 2021 and a huge drop in daily case numbers. In March 2021, when the Delta variant was detected in the UK, it had mutations in its genome that scientists suspected would make it far more transmissible than Alpha. Analysis coordinated by the UKHSA through its expert modelling group showed that although Delta was even more transmissible than Alpha, the vaccines were also working well against it. Because of this, the UK changed its vaccine policy, speeding up the delivery of second doses. By the end of June, Delta accounted for nearly all Covid-19 cases in the UK, and while the number of cases increased dramatically, deaths didn’t. The discovery of Omicron – and the finding that it is able to evade immunity in people with two vaccine doses – also resulted in a change in policy, this time with the acceleration of the booster programme. The current challenge is trying to determine whether the rapid spread of Omicron is due to the variant being more transmissible in general, or because it is able to infect people who have previously been vaccinated or infected. The balance of these two factors will determine how Omicron will spread in populations that do not have the immunity of South Africa and the UK. Researchers are also trying to gauge how severe Omicron infections are compared to Delta infections, but this will take time as those infected with Omicron this week will not be admitted to hospital for another week or more. These results will enable the UK and other countries to determine the scale and timing of hospital surges, so that we can be better prepared. Even though this pre-Christmas wave may feel similar to last year, we are in a much better position than 12 months ago. Crucially, we have vaccines that significantly reduce the severity of the disease. While case numbers are unprecedented and rising, vaccinated people are so far experiencing symptoms even milder than in previous waves. And Omicron was detected much faster than previous variants. We were able to quickly assess its risk based on our growing understanding of the virus’ mutations. Finally, we have streamlined processes to aggregate and analyse data, allowing us to make timely and realistic predictions of the impact of policies. Previous epidemics (such as polio, measles or the 1918 influenza) have only been studied retrospectively by epidemiologists. During this pandemic we are in a live arms race against the virus, adapting our tools against it in real time as we decode its genome. Nonetheless, it is a battle that cannot be fought solely by scientists, and it remains essential that we continue to deploy all our defences: by getting vaccinated, avoiding closed and crowded spaces, reducing contacts, testing when recommended, and continuing to wear masks.

12/22/2021,"Zak Crawley is poised for a recall on Boxing Day as England ponder up to four changes for the third Test in a bid to halt their faltering Ashes campaign. The 23-year-old shot to prominence with a six-and-a-half hour 267 against Pakistan in Southampton in 2020, only to be dropped in the summer after an alarming dose of second season syndrome that has returned a Test average of just 11 in 2021.  England renewed Crawley’s central contract in September, however, and have noted the 6ft 5in right-hander’s apparent enjoyment of Australian pitches in the nets and when making 45 for the Lions in the warm-up game. One of Rory Burns or Haseeb Hameed could now make way at the top of the order. Speaking earlier in the tour, Crawley said: “I feel in a really good place with my batting and if I get the chance I’m fairly confident that I could have a good time over here.” While both openers have struggled, Hameed initially shaping up well for scores of 25 and 27 in Brisbane only to fail twice in Adelaide, and Burns tormented until a fourth innings 34 in the second Test, another option for Crawley’s deployment would be to replace Ollie Pope and potentially reshuffle the batting order. However Jonny Bairstow is close to a return in the No 6 position, having been nudged out by Pope on the eve of the series only for the Surrey man to follow an initial 34 at the Gabba with single figures scores amid a troubling struggle against Nathan Lyon. As well as an expected return for Mark Wood in the bowling attack, the surface at the MCG may demand a spinner and thus a recall for Jack Leach. Chris Silverwood, the head coach, was unrepentant about the lack of a spinner in Adelaide, despite five wickets and plenty of turn for Lyon over the course of his 67 overs. Who makes way is not straightforward either, with Chris Woakes struggling for impact with the ball yet the only viable No 8 in the squad, as well as England’s third highest run-scorer in the series. If two bowling changes are made, it would mean two of Woakes, Ollie Robinson, Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad dropping out. Australia, meanwhile, are considering a debut for 32-year-old Scott Boland on his home ground in a selection that would see the Victoria right-armer become the country’s second Indigenous Australian men’s Test cricketer after Jason Gillespie. Though captain Pat Cummins returns, Josh Hazlewood is unlikely to be ready after missing the second Test with a side strain. The fitness levels of fellow seamers Mitchell Starc, Jhye Richardson and Michael Neser are all being assessed after the match went deep into the fifth day. Boland, viewed as an MCG specialist, would offer fresh legs here.",Sport/Sport,Zak Crawley poised for England recall in Ashes Boxing Day Test,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/22/zak-crawley-poised-for-england-recall-for-ashes-boxing-day-test-cricket
12/22/2021,"Considering how many parties they are alleged to have held, Boris Johnson and his government have recently seemed to be very short of friends. A national shortage of Downing Street defenders reached its nadir on 8 December, the morning after a video emerged of No 10 staff laughing and joking about “cheese and wine” at a “business meeting”. Even Sajid Javid, the health secretary, pulled out of a morning media round.  Most people would understand Javid’s reticence. Still, there was one man Johnson could count on even at his lowest ebb, never mind that he had called that person “totally fucking hopeless” in a WhatsApp message last year: Matt Hancock. A couple of weeks later, Hancock would find himself dragged into the conflagration over possible parties and social gatherings in Downing Street when the Guardian published a picture of a No 10 garden gathering in May 2020. He admitted he had been in the garden on the evening in question but said it was “not clear” whether a man in the photo seen from behind, with close cropped hair, a dark blue suit and a familiar stance, was him. On 8 December, though, he was riding to the government’s rescue on Good Morning Britain. It was not an easy appearance for Hancock, who faced hostile questioning comparing the alleged party to his own breach of Covid regulations – the notorious kiss with his aide Gina Coladangelo, now his partner, that was captured on CCTV and led to his swift resignation in June. “I wish I could help you more but I can’t,” he said. “The prime minister wasn’t there, as far as we understand, if there was a party.” Whatever Johnson said about Hancock’s performance as a minister, you might imagine he now seemed very useful as a human shield. After such a nightmarish year, Hancock could be forgiven for lying low – and, indeed, has repeatedly been encouraged to do so. So what lies behind his decision to return to the fray? Some view his re-emergence as a kind of penance, indicating his determination to reinvent himself as a backbench heavyweight. Among those he has convinced of his seriousness is Labour’s Rupa Huq, who noted on Twitter that “one can disapprove of @MattHancock’s breaking of the rules” but cited his work with her on efforts to curb the abuse of politicians, and his dyslexia campaign. “I know he looks up to Theresa May,” the former Conservative MP Ben Howlett said. “He said to me that looking at what she’s doing, holding the government to account and using her years of experience, is very inspiring to him.” But while May pulls no punches, Hancock’s parliamentary interventions have largely been to congratulate the government on its competence, leaving others less persuaded that he has entirely abandoned his ministerial ambitions. “Doing the media round when the government is keeping ministers off the airwaves – it’s definitely something people in Downing Street will notice,” said Henry Hill, a news editor for the ConservativeHome website. “It’s perfectly possible to have a meaningful career on the backbenches, but that’s never been the route he’s chosen. I would put good money on his goal being a return to government.” Hancock has always seemed to be a man in a hurry. Those who knew him in his days as a Cambridge master’s student remember a fairly flashy Jaguar and a tendency to drop friends in his hurry to climb the greasy pole. Now, too, he appears to be operating on fast-forward. His period of quiet reflection after his 27 June resignation ended on 7 September when he popped up in the House of Commons with a question in praise of the government’s furlough scheme. Rishi Sunak thought he was “absolutely right”. Hancock’s re-emergence into the full glare of media attention took a little longer – and then proceeded with an almost masochistic intensity. On 1 December he gave his first broadcast interview since his resignation, telling ITV’s Robert Peston: “I’d blown up every part of my life … I let a lot of people down.” The next week, the day before his appearance on Good Morning Britain, he gave an interview to Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield on This Morning. While he might have expected that an elevenses sofa chat about his campaign to improve dyslexia screening at primary schools was safe enough territory – non-ideological, unimpeachably positive and underpinned by his own experience of the condition – he endured a jarring change of pace from Schofield: “Was it your dyslexia that meant you misread the social distancing rules?” On air, Hancock appeared ashen, pensive, humble. Off air, ITV staffers suggest, he was in a better mood, enthusiastically bumping elbows with anyone in range and hanging around after filming to chat, when as a minister he would have swiftly departed. “He almost seemed euphoric,” said one. “He didn’t seem to mind being the butt of the joke.” Another said he came across as “nervous, but bouncy … There was a sense of – he’d got the difficult stuff out of the way, and now he’s back.” After the brutal realities of responsibility for the nation’s health during a once-in-a-generation pandemic, and a humiliating personal crisis that led to the end of his marriage, Hancock seemed to feel “now, suddenly, you’re free … I didn’t have the impression that he was wishing he was health secretary at all.” Whatever else, nobody could accuse Hancock of lacking the optimism to overcome experience. In August he announced that he would run the London marathon, only for his sponsorship page to be swamped by punters willing to give a minimum donation of £2 to St Nicholas Hospice Care to insult him. (“I hope your charity vest gives you nipple chafe,” wrote Alan Hamburgers, who gift-aided his contribution.) Still, Hancock got in shape, raised nearly £8,000 and came home in under four hours despite heckles from what he called a “small but noisy group of anti-vaxxers”. In September he posted a comeback video from Haverhill, Suffolk, in which he smiled sadly through a series of observations that might have applied equally to the global pandemic or his own defenestration. “We’ve got through it, haven’t we? And now we’re coming out the other side,” he told one constituent, before leaning on a fast-food counter like the last barfly at closing time and telling a man trying to cook burgers: “It’s nice to be out and about.” After a predictable quantity of internet derision, he deleted it. There was the surreal sight of him posing in stonewash jeans and rollneck on the red carpet of the Capital Jingle Bell Ball. There was the Daily Mail story in which he said “I have been approached to write a book”, only for the supposed publisher, HarperCollins, to issue an emphatic denial. A book summary leaked later gave the provisional title of The Race and explained that Hancock had led the UK to develop a vaccine “beating every country in the world”. Most painful, perhaps, was his announcement on 12 October that he had been offered a job at the UN Economic Commission for Africa (Uneca) as a special representative on financial innovation and climate change. The appointment was reportedly the result of representations made by the campaigner and government adviser Nimco Ali, a close friend of Carrie Johnson, to Uneca. Hancock retweeted congratulatory messages from her and 11 others before the offer was withdrawn on 16 October. While the reversal was ostensibly forced by a sudden realisation that Hancock was ineligible as a sitting MP, it came about after at least 64 NGO leaders and scholars expressed their displeasure, according to a list provided by Tian Johnson, the founder of the African Alliance for HIV Prevention. Johnson said he saw Hancock as “a disgraced politician whose competence has been questioned in his own country and who knows little about Africa”. Nick Dearden, the director of Global Justice Now, said he had been dismayed by the appointment. “People told me, we’ve lost this one, no way is it going to be withdrawn,” he said. “So the uproar must have been much more significant than people in the UN expected.” Through it all, even some of Hancock’s critics admit a certain grudging admiration. “I think there’s something wrong with him,” a bemused Labour MP said. “He just keeps coming back for more. He’s got what boxers would call a very good chin.” His allies, meanwhile, view his re-emergence as a story of redemption. “He’s still the same person,” said Rachel Hood, the chair of the West Suffolk Conservative Association. “Life’s not an exact science. Suffolk people are very nice – of course there are always dissenters, but when [the local party] looked at it all, we took the view that we would support him.” He had been a model constituency MP since then, she added, visiting a local prison literacy project and supporting a campaign to bring a cinema to Newmarket. If such efforts lack the epic scale of The Race, Hancock is unwilling to say that he yearns for the bigger stage. “He’s not in a rush,” said someone who worked with him in government. “He’s enjoying backbench life more than he expected.” Whatever the future holds, they added, he has significant support on the backbenches, particularly among the 2019 intake. MPs praised his responsiveness during the Covid crisis, and noted his keenness to be liked and respected by colleagues. But they were not always complimentary about his competence. And Tory strategists poured cold water on the idea of a cabinet return. One branded him a “total fantasist”. A second said while he had built up some credibility during the pandemic, Hancock was now seen as “a joke figure”. “There is currently no way back for him,” a veteran observer of the Conservative party said. “He has no real friends in parliament. No one owes him anything … A period of silence on his part would be welcomed by most of his colleagues.” If so, it appears they are unlikely to get their wish.",News/Politics,‘He keeps coming back for more’: Matt Hancock’s rapid return to the fray,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/22/matt-hancock-rapid-return-to-the-fray-he-keeps-coming-back-for-more
12/22/2021,"The Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich has settled his libel claim against the journalist Catherine Belton over her best-selling book Putin’s People, after an agreement was reached late on Tuesday. The text will now recognise that the allegation Abramovich bought Chelsea football club at the Russian president’s behest is not a statement of fact. It will include additional denials from the oligarch’s spokesperson and the club.  It will also correct a claim that the late oligarch Boris Berezovsky co-owned the Russian oil company Sibneft with Abramovich. The amendment follows a 2011-12 high court legal battle between the two men, which Abramovich won. The book’s publisher, HarperCollins, has agreed to make a payment to charity “in recognition of this error”, it said. Abramovich sued over a number of claims, including that he bought Chelsea on Vladimir Putin’s orders. He was one of three Russian tycoons who initiated libel proceedings against Belton and HarperCollins, together with the Russian state oil company Rosneft. The other defendants subsequently settled or withdrew their claims. Abramovich ended his case after HarperCollins said on Wednesday some information concerning the oligarch was inaccurate. It agreed to make revisions to the book, widely acclaimed as the definitive work on the Putin era. HarperCollins hailed the overnight settlement as a fair agreement. There are no damages being paid to Abramovich himself. Both sides will pay their own costs. Had the libel trial gone ahead in the high court next year the legal bill was likely to have exceeded £10m, it is understood. The publisher said: “While the book always included a denial that Mr Abramovich was acting under anybody’s direction when he purchased Chelsea, the new edition will include a more detailed explanation of Mr Abramovich’s motivations for buying the club. “HarperCollins has also made clear in the book that there is no evidence, beyond the statements of the individuals themselves, supporting claims made to the author by [the former Kremlin insider] Sergei Pugachev and two other unnamed individuals about the purchase of Chelsea Football Club.” HarperCollins acknowledged that a high court judge described Berezovsky as an “inherently unreliable witness”. It added: “HarperCollins and the author apologise that these aspects of the book were not as clear as they would have liked them to have been and are happy to have now clarified the text.” Despite the revisions, the agreement is being seen overall as a victory for Belton, who has come under unprecedented legal assault from billionaires with Kremlin ties. Abramovich served for eight years as governor of Chukotka, a region in Russia’s far east. He has consistently denied being under the Russian government’s control. In a statement, she said “this last year has felt like a war of attrition” in which she had been “bombarded with lawsuits” from four Russian billionaires and Rosneft. Belton added: “Though the claimants have denied it was coordinated, it has seemed to me similar to the Kremlin’s multi-pronged campaign against Ukraine in which it has sought to exhaust the west into making security concessions over Nato’s expansion.” She continued: “Throughout, HarperCollins has staunchly defended the book. I could not have wished for a better or braver publisher more committed to public interest journalism.” Campaigners have described the case against Belton as an abuse of the UK’s libel system. Abramovich sued the former Financial Times journalist personally as well as her publisher. The settlement was made following an approach by Abramovich, it is understood. HarperCollins said Belton had always been willing to include the oligarch’s comments on the allegations, and recognised that books on controversial contemporary themes needed updating as new information emerged. At a preliminary hearing in November, Mrs Justice Tipples ruled that several passages in the book that Abramovich said conveyed untrue statements about him were potentially defamatory of him. One such claim was the suggestion that Abramovich was “under the control of Putin” and that the oligarch was obliged “to make the fortune from his business empire available for the use of President Putin and his regime”, Tipples wrote, in a 34-page ruling. But she ruled three out of four sections complained of by Rosneft were not defamatory, with the oil firm subsequently shelving its case. Tipples emphasised that the court was only, at that point, adjudicating on meaning. It was not deciding whether the allegations made about Abramovich or anyone else were true or false. Following Wednesday’s settlement the claims will not be tested in court. At the initial hearing, Abramovich’s lawyer said the book repeated “lazy inaccuracies about Abramovich’s role in various events” and made false and damaging statements about him which were “completely without foundation”. Belton spent seven years writing Putin’s People and was based in Moscow as the bureau chief for the FT. Last month, she was named the 2021 outstanding investigative journalist in awards named after Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian anti-corruption lawyer who died in jail.",News/World news,Roman Abramovich settles libel claim over Putin biography ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/22/roman-abramovich-settles-libel-claim-over-putin-biography
