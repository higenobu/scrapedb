2/23/2022,"A police officer involved in the arrest of Kumanjayi Walker has agreed in evidence before the Northern Territory supreme court that the Warlpiri man continued “fucking around” and “was not incapacitated” after being shot three times. Remote Sgt Adam Eberl was the only other person in the room when Constable Zachary Rolfe shot Walker on 9 November 2019 at a house in the remote community of Yuendumu, about 300km from Alice Springs.  On Wednesday, Eberl continued his evidence in Rolfe’s trial for murder. Rolfe is charged in relation to the second and third shots fired at Walker, which the prosecution has told the court were delivered at close-range while Eberl and Walker were struggling on a mattress on the floor of the property. Rolfe has pleaded not guilty in the Northern Territory supreme court and defends his actions on the basis they were justified in light of the risk to him and Eberl posed by Walker, who had stabbed Rolfe with a pair of scissors shortly before the shooting. Eberl told the court on Wednesday that he did not know Walker had been shot until after the third shot had been fired. In court, he was played body-worn camera footage of the incident, which detailed him saying to Rolfe, “did you? Fuck”. He agreed with Philip Strickland SC, for the prosecution, that at that time he was asking Rolfe if he had shot Walker. Eberl said he heard a “dull thud” when the first shot was fired, while he was standing and wrestling with Walker. He believed a bean bag round may have been fired by another officer who had been outside the property, as the noise did not sound like a shot. Soon after, Eberl and Walker ended up on the mattress, the court heard. Eberl said he knew Walker had a sharp weapon in his right hand, but did not know what it was. He said he used his left arm to grab Walker’s left arm, and, while standing, tried to apply a police manoeuvre known as a “seatbelt hold”. Once they were on the mattress, Eberl told the court he used both arms to try to contain Walker’s left arm, knowing that Walker’s right arm was underneath his own body. Eberl said he wanted to try to stop Walker from turning his right arm towards him. Eberl, who previously confirmed in his evidence more than a decade’s experience in martial arts and weighed about 95kg at the time of the incident, told Strickland that he could not remember seeing or feeling Walker’s upper body move between the time he fell with him on to the mattress and when he heard the third shot. He said he could not see the scissors while he was on top of Walker, and agreed with Strickland that he was attempting to use ground stabilisation techniques he had learned during police training while struggling with Walker. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Strickland told the court during his opening address that it would be alleged Eberl had control of Walker, 19, when he was shot for the second and third time by Rolfe. Lawyers for Rolfe have previously said they will dispute the extent to which Walker was under control. Eberl said on Wednesday that while he could not recall seeing or feeling Walker’s upper body move during this time, “I believe he was trying to move the whole time”. Under cross-examination by David Edwardson QC, for Rolfe, Eberl was asked about being captured on body-worn camera footage saying to Walker “don’t fuck around, I’ll fucken smash ya mate” soon after the third shot was fired. Officers were attempting to handcuff Walker about the time Eberl is heard uttering the remarks.

2/23/2022,"Britain is being urged to pledge billions of dollars to get the fight against malaria, tuberculosis and Aids “back on track” after efforts were ravaged by the Covid-19 pandemic. The UK has historically been one of the main donors to the Global Fund, an international financing organisation aimed at ending the three deadly epidemics by 2030. Now it is warning that, unless donors make an unprecedented total funding pledge of $18bn (£13.25bn) this year, that goal will be missed.  “In the face of the catastrophic impact of Covid-19 on the fight against HIV, TB and malaria, the choice is stark: we either increase funding, or we abandon hope of finally defeating these epidemics by 2030,” said Peter Sands, executive director of the Global Fund. In a statement seen by the Guardian, a group of African politicians echoed that warning, stressing that the world faces “a critical moment”. “Covid-19 devastated health systems and crippled the global response to health challenges … What follows now will be decisive in getting progress back on track,” write the seven parliamentarians from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Rwanda and Senegal. “Key donor countries who have played an important role in this historic partnership, such as the US, UK and others, once again have the opportunity to demonstrate leadership with strong funding pledges, which will be met by implementing countries upholding commitments to mobilise their own resources.” Campaigners said the UK government’s decision to cut the aid budget from 0.7% to 0.5% of gross national income has already had an impact on global efforts against HIV, Aids, TB and malaria, contributing to a wider stalling of progress during the pandemic. Doubt was cast on Britain’s likely commitment to the Global Fund on Tuesday when the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said, in a written statement, she was “rebalancing the aid budget towards bilateral programmes” and, implicitly, away from multilateral organisations. The Global Fund said the record target of $18bn was needed because “significant progress” in tackling the three diseases had been lost. “Hard-won gains against HIV, TB and malaria are being reversed, with devastating consequences for the poorest and most vulnerable communities,” it said. “The entire United Nations sustainable development goals agenda is now at risk, as inequities deepen, poverty spirals and social and political tensions grow.” If the target was reached, it said, it would enable the fund to save 20 million lives between 2024 and 2026, and reduce the death toll across the three diseases to 950,000 in 2026, down from 2.4 million in 2020, and from 4 million in 2005. Mike Podmore, director of StopAids, welcomed the African MPs’ call. “These parliamentarians are right to speak out,” he said. “The UK has played a leading role in the global response to date, but in order to avoid losing the substantial progress made against Aids, tuberculosis and malaria, the UK must deliver a strong funding pledge at this year’s replenishment, positioning itself as a reliable partner.” With deaths from TB increasing to 1.5 million in 2020, Aaron Oxley, executive director of non-profit Results UK, said commitment was needed “now more than ever”. “It is essential that the UK government listen to their counterparts in countries who are implementing programmes in partnership with the Global Fund and make an ambitious pledge at the upcoming seventh replenishment.” Gareth Jenkins, director of advocacy at Malaria No More UK, said it was “vital that the UK continues to make a leading down payment on the health security of the world”. According to the World Health Organization, 627,000 people died of malaria in 2020, an increase of 12% on the year before. Most – 96% – were in sub-Saharan Africa. Set up in 2002, the Global Fund raises and spends funds during three-year “replenishment” periods, the seventh of which begins in 2024. The sixth replenishment meeting in 2019 in Lyon, hosted by President Emmanuel Macron, raised $14.02bn, the largest amount ever for a multilateral health organisation. The seventh replenishment meeting will be in the US later this year hosted, by President Joe Biden. A spokesperson for the foreign, commonwealth and development office said: “As one of its largest donors, UK aid to the Global Fund is actively fighting malaria, Aids and tuberculosis around the world. We continue to support the Fund’s vital work.”",News/Global development,"Increase funding or abandon hope of ending malaria, TB and Aids, UK warned",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/23/increase-funding-or-abandon-hope-of-ending-malaria-tb-and-aids-uk-warned
2/23/2022,"The drinks company Innocent has had an advert banned by the Advertising Standards Authority after environmentalists reported it for claiming that drinking its smoothies is good for the environment. In the television ad, a man and his otter companion find that their boat is hijacked by revellers celebrating chaotically as they approach a large waterfall. They sing about “messing up the planet” until they find themselves in peril, hanging off the edge of a cliff. They then row back to safety, clear up the rubbish, and start turning apples on a tree into Innocent smoothies, which they all drink as they “fix up the planet”.  The brand, which is known for its “wackaging” and is majority owned by Coca-Cola, has been making an effort to improve its climate credentials among consumers. Complainants, including the activist group Plastics Rebellion, argued that the ad implied that drinking smoothies from a disposable plastic bottle was good for the environment. In response, Innocent said it was a B Corp, which was a certification granted by the organisation B Lab to companies that demonstrated a high social and environmental performance. Innocent said it had committed to being carbon neutral by 2030, and had opened a carbon-neutral factory that ran on renewable energy and a cleaning system that reduced water usage by 75%. It also said it was not trying to show that smoothies are good for the environment, and was instead making a call to action to its customers not to harm the planet. The ASA ruled in favour of the complainants. It found that Innocent’s advert drew a strong association between the drinks and a positive impact on the environment. The ruling states that “many consumers would interpret the overall presentation of the ad to mean that purchasing Innocent products was a choice which would have a positive environmental impact”. Officials said they wanted evidence that this claim was in fact correct, and they were not satisfied with the response. The ASA said: “Although we acknowledged that Innocent were undertaking various actions which were aimed at reducing the environmental impact of their products, that did not demonstrate that their products had a net positive environmental impact over their full life cycles. We also noted that their drinks bottles included non-recycled plastic and that the extraction of raw materials and subsequent processing of those materials in order to produce the bottle would have a negative impact on the environment.” Innocent is now not allowed to use the advert in its current form, or make claims about the supposed environmental merits of its products without proof for them. A spokesperson for Plastics Rebellion said: “You can’t be a major contributor to a global health and environmental emergency and claim to fix up the planet. Innocent are being disingenuous about the dangers of plastic’s threat to human health and environment, as well as trivialising the horrific scale of the problem by repeating the mantra ‘reduce, reuse, recycle’. They’re guilty of brushing the plastic crisis under the carpet and trivialising it.” A spokesperson for Innocent said: “We’re disappointed to see the ruling from the ASA. Our advert was always intended to highlight important global environmental issues and the need for collective action to make a change. We transparently share more about the work that we do on sustainability on our website. As with any new guidelines, we’d like to work with the ASA and other brands to understand how to align to them to continue the conversation on these important topics.”",News/Media, Innocent TV ad banned for claiming its drinks help environment,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/23/innocent-tv-ad-banned-for-claiming-its-drinks-help-environment
2/23/2022,"OK, spill: who has been adding gay pills to the water supply? Someone must have been, because the number of LGBTQ-identifying adults in the US has jumped dramatically. According to a recent Gallup poll, the numbers have gone from 3.5% in 2012 to 7.1% in 2021. Gen Z, defined by Gallup as people born between 1997 and 2003, is leading the charge: 20.8% of them identified as LGBTQ+ in 2021, up from 10.5% in 2017. People take things very seriously these days, so I should probably state for the record that I am obviously joking about the whole gay pills in the water thing. As a card-carrying member of the International Society for the Advancement of Homosexual Lifestyles (ISAHL), I can assure you that the Gay Agenda explicitly prohibits the use of bioweapons. No, we focus solely on mind control techniques. A little bit of brainwashing, subliminal messaging during the ad breaks, that sort of thing.  I can’t divulge the details of any of ISAHL’s top-secret techniques, I’m afraid. But I will say this: it warms the cockles of my homosexual heart to see such a big increase in young people feeling comfortable being themselves. I came out 20 years ago when “gay” was still an acceptable insult, you could count the number of out celebrities on one hand and if you saw an LGBTQ+ character on TV there was a 99% chance they were a psychopath or a predator. The first time I worked up the courage to kiss the woman I was dating in public, a stranger tried to hit me in the face. I came out relatively early in life but, thanks to the stigma that was still attached to being gay, it took me a long time to be proud. Things are far from perfect now, of course, particularly for trans people, but we’ve made a hell of a lot of progress.

2/23/2022,"Donald Trump’s former attorney Rudy Giuliani is expected to cooperate with the House select committee investigating January 6, and potentially reveal his contacts with Republican members of Congress involved in the former president’s effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election. The move by Giuliani to appear before the panel – in a cooperation deal that could be agreed within weeks, according to two sources briefed on negotiations – could mark a breakthrough moment for the inquiry as it seeks to interview key members of Trump’s inner circle.  That is the case because even though Trump’s allies and Republican members of Congress already known to have been involved in such efforts have refused to help the panel, Giuliani is now in a position to inform House investigators about any possible culpability. Broadly, Giuliani has indicated through his lawyer to the select committee that he will produce documents and answer questions about Trump’s schemes to return himself to office on 6 January that House investigators had outlined in a subpoena issued to him last month. The former president’s attorney is prepared to reveal his contacts and the roles played by Republican members of Congress in the scheme Giuliani helped orchestrate to have then-vice-president Mike Pence stop the certification of Joe Biden’s election victory. Giuliani is also prepared to divulge details about Trump’s pressure campaign on Pence to adopt the scheme, and the effort coordinated by him and the Trump White House to have legislatures certify slates of electors for Trump in states actually won by Biden. But the former president’s attorney has indicated that he will assist the select committee only if his appearance is not pursuant to his subpoena, and does not have to give records or discuss his contacts with Trump over executive and attorney-client privilege concerns. Giuliani is prepared to make exceptions in instances where the panel can demonstrate that meetings with Trump that would have otherwise been subject to those protections might have been broken, and that the protections should not apply. The demands surrounding the circumstances of his cooperation reflect comments he made on Newsmax last week when he falsely claimed the select committee was “illegal”, and claimed that “it doesn’t have minority membership and really can’t subpoena anybody.” The select committee appears to have ignored his remarks as they move to finalize an agreement with Giuliani. The comments did not come up in recent talks and the panel last week allowed Giuliani to postpone his document production deadline for a second time, one of the sources said. That may be explained in large part because of the panel’s determination to get the cooperation of one of Trump’s closest if problematic advisers who was involved in efforts to overturn the 2020 election from the start – and has a penchant for sometimes revealing too much. Giuliani could speak to events such as a 18 December 2020 meeting in the Oval Office where Trump reviewed a draft executive order to seize voting machines and verbally agreed to install conspiracy theorist Sidney Powell as special counsel to investigate election fraud. The Guardian has reported that Giuliani then led the Trump “war room” at the Willard hotel in Washington DC when Trump called from the White House and discussed ways to stop Biden’s certification – and could speak to non-privileged elements of the plan. The cooperation deal would also technically involve Giuliani turning over documents in addition to appearing before the select committee, the sources said, but the logistics were unclear given the FBI last year seized his devices that he used on 6 January. Giuliani is committed to appearing before the panel, the source said, but it was not clear whether he would testify under oath in a closed-door deposition, for which the select committee has been pushing, or appear in a more informal interview on Capitol Hill. A spokesperson for the select committee declined to comment on negotiations with witnesses. The sources added negotiations could still collapse, but if a deal could be agreed, Giuliani would probably appear before the panel at least before the end of March. The select committee has been quietly making substantial progress in its investigation into the events of 6 January, securing records from the National Archives, as well as documents and testimony from some of Trump’s top aides and advisers. Last month, the chairman of the panel, congressman Bennie Thompson, revealed that House investigators had spoken to more than 500 witnesses and obtained more than 50,000 documents, including thousands from Trump’s former White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows. The willingness by Giuliani to negotiate what appears to be an expansive cooperation deal has come in stark contrast to the defiance expressed by the initial set of Trump aides and advisers who were subpoenaed by the select committee last year. Trump’s former chief strategist Steve Bannon refused to comply with his subpoena in its entirety, boasting executive privilege protection – only to be referred to the justice department for criminal contempt of Congress and indicted on two counts about four weeks later. That has served as a warning to other witnesses. Even if his cooperation deal ultimately falls through, Giuliani may be engaging with the select committee at least to avoid a similar fate to Bannon and a potentially costly legal battle to fight such charges. The benefits of partial cooperation have also become apparent, after Meadows was held in contempt of Congress for refusing to appear for a deposition as required by his subpoena, but remains unindicted two months after his initial referral to the justice department.",News/US news,Rudy Giuliani poised to cooperate with January 6 committee,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/22/giuliani-cooperate-january-6-committee
2/23/2022,"Asked this week about whether his move to drop Covid isolation requirements would drive infectious workers into the office, Boris Johnson said UK workers should learn from their German counterparts and stay home when unwell. The prime minister did not mention the stark differences in the support available for British workers compared with Germany and the rest of the world, and whether this might explain their reluctance to take a sick day.  Employers’ groups have warned that the UK’s statutory sick pay regime is among the least generous in Europe, and steps by the government to scale back support as part of the “living with Covid” approach Johnson was announcing on Monday could discourage those who catch the virus from staying at home. Under the new strategy, support payments of £500 for people on low-incomes in England will end from Thursday when the legal requirement to self-isolate is scrapped. A month later, on 24 March, workers who are off sick will need to once again wait for four days of absence through illness to claim statutory sick pay, rather than from day one, reverting to pre-pandemic rules. Johnson told the No 10 briefing to announce the plan: “I’ve often heard it said over the last couple of years that we have a habit of going back to work, or going into work, when we’re not well. And people contrast that with Germany for instance where, I’m told, they’re much more disciplined about not going to work if you’re sick.” Germany has one of the best sick pay packages among all of the OECD group of leading global economies, with laws requiring employers to pay staff 100% of wages for the first six weeks of sickness. By contrast the UK has one of the lowest – at just £96.35 a week it is worth less than a quarter of a typical salary. The proportion of a UK workers’ salary covered by sick pay is just 19%, according to the TUC. Rates are higher in Spain (42%), Sweden (64%) and Belgium (93%), with support only worse in South Korea and the US, where workers do not have a legal right to any sick pay at all. “This has been a thorn in our sides throughout this pandemic – undermining public health and pushing workers into hardship,” said Kate Bell, head of economics and employment rights at the TUC. “But rather than learning this lesson, ministers are doubling down on their mistakes. “The decision to stop access to sick pay – from the first day of illness – will put millions of low-paid workers in an even tighter financial bind if they become sick.” Even before the changes announced this week, Britain’s lowest paid tended to miss out on the support altogether. Analysis from the Resolution Foundation finds as many as 2 million employees are ineligible for statutory sick pay because they earn less than the £120 lower earnings limit required for the benefit. This has meant one in six workers in customer-facing sectors – where the spread of Covid-19 is most likely – receive no statutory sick pay at all. Women are more likely than men to fall below the threshold, as well workers on zero-hours contracts. According to the IPPR thinktank, households earning less than £25,000 are around twice as likely to lack access to any sick pay compared to households earning above £75,000. People working in outdoor trades, such as farming and construction, are five times more likely to lack access than managers and senior officials, while those working in manufacturing, manual trades, beauty, transportation and catering are also around twice as likely to lack access to sick pay. Early on in the pandemic, the government moved to provide statutory sick pay from day one of illness, abolishing three waiting days required to receive the benefit. However, employment experts and unions warned the reforms needed to go further. According to research in the British Medical Journal, those with the lowest household income were three times less likely to be able to work from home and less likely to be able to self-isolate. It comes after years of the benefit gradually being eroded to its lowest level since March 2003 after inflation is taken into account, while the soaring cost of living is expected to further damage the safety net this spring amid a surge for household energy bills. In the UK statutory sick pay is paid by law to employers for up to 28 weeks. Some staff benefit from their firm topping up closer to their full pay under occupational sick pay schemes. However, government estimates made before the pandemic suggest 26% of the workforce rely on statutory sick pay alone when they are ill. Business leaders have criticised the government for cutting back a rebate for firms, paid for by the state, when they are required to pay statutory sick pay to their staff during the pandemic. Mike Cherry, the national chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said lasting reforms were vital. “Even before the pandemic hit, the government recognised the need for a sick pay rebate for smaller firms, so it’s surprising to see it taking this route forward when hundreds of thousands of people are still testing positive for Covid,” he said.",News/World news,Johnson’s Germany comparison highlights UK’s low sick pay,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/23/johnsons-germany-comparison-highlights-uk-sick-pay-deficit
2/23/2022,"I repaid my student loan early, but the Student Loans Company (SLC) is still deducting repayments – £1,089 over two months – from my earnings. The problem began when SLC assigned my final, lump‑sum payment to the wrong account. Its systems therefore show me as owing £12,000. It has admitted an error, but can’t say when I’ll be refunded. SM, London  Student loan repayments are crippling enough, but judging from the cries of pain in my inbox it seems that technical problems, human error and buck-passing by SLC and HMRC are compounding the issue. JA from Torquay has also appealed to me after reading my report last year on a graduate who feared she was overpaying thousands of pounds because SLC was unable to confirm her balance. “I haven’t been able to view a statement since 2019,” JA wrote. “SLC says it doesn’t know my balance as HMRC has put a mark on my account. HMRC says it can’t help.” It’s deeply concerning that problems deemed intractable by SLC and HMRC when a customer complains can be miraculously solved if a headline looms. SLC was able to pinpoint its error in SM’s case within two days of my contact. “We apologise that when he called to pay off his student loan we incorrectly applied the payment to the bursary element of his account, instead of his loan balance.” He was refunded his overpaid £1,089 the next day. HMRC and SLC investigated JA’s situation at my instigation, and discovered that his employer had miscalculated the loan repayments deducted three years ago. “The account has been impacted by a discrepancy in the amount of deductions reported by his employer to HMRC for the 19/20 tax year,” SLC says. “This has caused an additional repayment of £63, which he did not, in fact, have to pay, to be applied to his student loan account. Due to this discrepancy, access to his online account was restricted.” HMRC confirmed it was rectifying the issue and SLC is expecting it to send his end-of-year reconciliation file by the end of this month.

2/23/2022,"Patient care may suffer as a result of cuts to the NHS budget to fund the continuing costs of Covid, NHS leaders and Labour have said, after Sajid Javid refused to say where the axe would fall. The Department of Health and Social Care is trying to make savings from its budget to fund free lateral flow tests for elderly people, Covid surveillance studies and genomic sequencing, after the Treasury refused its request for £5bn in extra funding.  Although the government announced an end to most free mass testing and contract tracing on Monday, remaining Covid measures are expected to cost more than £1bn. The Treasury and the DHSC refused to say exactly how much cash would be needed or which services would have to be cut back, prompting fears that the NHS could have to find savings at a time of a huge waiting list backlog. It is understood that DHSC officials are working on identifying savings in the department’s £178.5bn budget for 2022-23, to fund the measures agreed on Monday, including maintaining a “baseline” testing capability that can be scaled up if necessary. They have ruled out hitting Javid’s plan for tackling waiting lists, but a government source would not rule out any other areas being affected, saying a “significant amount of money” would have to be found by “reprioritising”. “There’s not any easy cuts to be made anywhere, but we are going to have to shift money from elsewhere towards this, because having this in place is the priority. It’s a significant amount of money, but we think it’s doable,” the government source said. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, said it was “pretty humiliating for Sajid Javid” after he lost the cabinet row with the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, over the extra cash for Covid. “He asked for £5bn and has ended up with nothing. We know as a result of the chancellor stitching him up there is a significant shortfall facing the NHS budget and the health secretary needs to come clean about where those cuts are going to fall and address concerns of NHS leaders that funding cuts of this nature might compromise NHS care,” he said. Saffron Cordery, the deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, warned the government against abandoning its commitment to give the NHS “whatever it needs” to tackle Covid and called for transparency about “where the impact of these extra costs will fall”. “Trust leaders are understandably anxious over reports that the ongoing and significant costs of living with Covid will be met by ‘reprioritising’ the NHS’s existing budget,” she said. “There is a very real risk of trade-offs affecting the quality of patient care – something no one wants to see.” The British Medical Association also raised concerns that the NHS may have to fund the cost of testing for its own staff. Dr Vishal Sharma, the BMA consultants committee chair, said it would cost “a significant amount for hospitals who are already under financial pressure and could be faced with having to make further difficult decisions about how best funding should be allocated which could leave a shortfall elsewhere”. Hospital bosses are concerned that the Treasury’s refusal to give the DHSC any more money to cover the NHS’s costs of dealing with Covid could force them to either pay for the cost of Covid drugs and the enhanced cleaning regimes from their own budgets or use the billions they have been given to tackle the 6.1 million-strong backlog of patients awaiting hospital treatment. An NHS source said: “Everyone’s been arguing about where the money will come from. Although it’s been reported that the argument is over and that the Treasury have refused to give the DHSC the money they asked for, discussions about this are still going on and we are waiting to hear the government’s last word on this. But the money may have to come from the money set aside for elective recovery or we might get more money in the next autumn statement.” Ministers confirmed last month that they would cover the cost of personal protective equipment for NHS staff in England in 2022-23 at least.",News/Society,"NHS cuts to cover Covid costs may hit patient care, Labour warns",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/23/nhs-cuts-to-cover-covid-costs-may-hit-patient-care-labour-warns
2/23/2022,"Hello, Warren Murray bringing you into the middle of a momentous week.  Ukraine has called up its military reservists after Russia began moving troops into the country’s east, while Vladimir Putin said he supported vastly expanded territorial claims made by two breakaway areas. Overnight, Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, said it was Putin’s “plan all along to invade Ukraine”. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, ruled out a general mobilisation of the army while warning that Ukraine could face a battle for its very existence. From Kyiv, Emma Graham-Harrison writes that nearly a decade of war has left Ukraine with about half a million combat-experienced veterans, many of whom are preparing to fight again. That combined with the sheer size of Ukrainian territory means that even if Russia can outgun them on a conventional battlefield, any military clash could lead to a protracted and bloody partisan conflict. After Putin on Monday signed a presidential order recognising the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk, it has become clear the Russian president is backing the territories’ claims to nearly three times the area currently under their control. In developments on the sanctions front, Japan has targeted Russian government bonds and trade and people linked to the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. Australia said eight senior Russian security officials and the oil and gas sectors would be targeted in its first round of sanctions. Justin Trudeau said Canada was sending hundreds more troops along with sanctions against Russian MPs and state-backed banks. It comes after Joe Biden said the US would sanction Russian banks, oligarchs and others. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has suspended certification of the Russian gas pipe Nord Stream 2, while the EU announced punitive measures that may be expanded at a G7 meeting later this week. Britain’s sanctions package unveiled by Boris Johnson in the Commons has come under attack from his own Conservative MPs, among others, as too weak. ‘Embarrassment’ of Johnson questionnaire – The first glimpse of a “partygate” questionnaire confirms Downing Street insiders are being questioned under police caution and asked if they have a “reasonable excuse”. Boris Johnson has already returned his replies to the Metropolitan police’s questions, and is believed to have argued, with the help of a lawyer, that he attended lockdown-breaching social events in No 10 in a work capacity. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said: “This is an embarrassment that for the first time in UK history we have a PM interviewed under police caution.” Johnson receiving a fixed penalty notice for breaching rules that he himself drew up is regarded as unacceptable to many Conservative backbenchers, and would be likely to prompt more letters calling for a vote of no confidence.

NHS England has promised to spend £2.3bn setting up at least 100 community diagnostic centres (CDCs) by early 2025. Richard Evans from the Society and College of Radiographers, said there was a risk the NHS would end up “robbing Peter to pay Paul” by pulling specialists into the CDCs from other areas of the health service that still needed them. A spokesperson for the health department said the NHS was employing record numbers of staff and was “focused on securing even more staff”. Young turn inward – Happiness and confidence among Britain’s 16- to 25-year-olds is at a 13-year low, according to research exposing the impact of Covid. Forty per cent of young people report being anxious about socialising with others and 35% say they have never felt more alone, the Prince’s Trust reports. “There are great hugs and shrieks when they get together, but then everyone goes on their phone,” said a youth worker in London. Claire Carroll from the Prince’s Trust said: “Young people aren’t getting the same level of new experiences and that’s stopping them becoming independent.” Jonathan Townsend, the trust’s UK CEO, said: “With the right support from businesses, government and charities we can turn this around and ensure young people have the right skills and confidence to feel positive about their future work, and about their life overall.” Light on the tiles – The largest expanse of Roman mosaic found in London for more than half a century has been unearthed at a site believed to have been a venue for high-ranking officials to lounge in while being served food and drink. Dating from the late second to early third century, the flowers and geometric patterns were a thrilling, once-in-a-lifetime find, said Antonietta Lerz, of the Museum of London Archaeology (Mola). The mosaic, which is eight metres long, was discovered about a month ago at a construction site near London Bridge. It will be lifted later this year for preservation and conservation work, with the eventual hope of it being publicly displayed.

The Times says “West imposes sanctions as Biden warns of war” and carries an image of Russian troops and tanks in the Rostov region, close to the border with Ukraine. The Express demands “Punish Putin harder now” urging Boris Johnson to squeeze 150 Russian oligarchs. The Mirror agrees, saying “Get dirty Russian money out of UK now” and calls UK sanctions “feeble”. The Metro says “We’ll grab him by the roubles” – it carries a hint of discontent at the extent of the sanctions but is broadly positive about the “first barrage” of measures. The Guardian focuses on the latest developments abroad, with the headline “War threat grows as Putin backs Ukraine proxy states” and a huge image of Russian tanks ploughing through the mud close to Ukraine’s border. It gives prominence to Biden’s comments and Germany’s decision to put the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia on hold. The Telegraph gives the US president the headline – “Putin is invading and will go much further, says Biden” – and Johnson the main image. The Mail takes a more visceral approach with “Twisted Putin is ready for bloodshed”. It notes Russian tank movements and says 100 Nato jets are on alert. The Financial Times has “Putin backs separatist claims to whole Donbas region of Ukraine”. “Putin takes Europe to brink of war”, says the i, and the Sun’s headline is “Boris: stop mad Vlad”.
