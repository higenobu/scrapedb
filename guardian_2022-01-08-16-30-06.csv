1/8/2022,"Well over 100 of the Conservatives’ 361 MPs are aligned with one or more of a string of internal pressure groups. Here are the main ones:  Led by the former chief whip Mark Harper and the former Brexit minister Steve Baker, the CRG’s size and opposition to new Covid rules is essentially the reason why England has notably fewer restrictions than other UK nations. While informal in structure, the CRG has organised and disciplined messaging, employing an external PR consultant. Support estimated at 80 to 100 MPs. Set up in the lead-up to the Cop26 climate summit, its members insist they are not climate emergency sceptics but believe policies such as emissions targets and the phasing out of conventional cars have not been fully thought out and will adversely affect poorer Britons. The NZSG has 18 MPs as public supporters and claims “many” more. Partly based around culture war issues, and what its chair, the Tory backbencher John Hayes, terms a struggle against “subversives” such as Black Lives Matter and Extinction Rebellion, its 136-page policy booklet sets out ideas on everything from immigration to the legal system and family life. Sixteen MPs contributed to the booklet. Originally launched by Esther McVey in parallel with her brief leadership bid to succeed Theresa May, with policies including redirecting foreign aid to domestic priorities, it boasts 159 MPs as official supporters including several cabinet ministers. However, it is less active in terms of openly agitating for policy change. Led by the former Northern Powerhouse minister Jake Berry, this is a geographical faction aimed at boosting spending and investment in the north of England, north Wales and Scottish borders. More than 50 members. Very low key, and not officially a party faction, as it has two Labour members and one from the DUP. But it is Tory-dominated, and is arguably the most financially significant pressure group anywhere in the UK. It has been central to parliamentary and media efforts to keep fuel duty frozen for 11 years and counting, a policy that has cost the Treasury somewhere north of £100bn. The model for the other factions. Set up in 1993, gradually moving from being the voice of Euroscepticism to that of hardline Brexiters. Hugely influential in the Commons revolts that saw off May’s limited Brexit compromises, and then ejected her from Downing Street.

1/8/2022,"Government lawyers have said any legal challenge against making low-paid people take confirmatory PCR tests to get financial support during isolation would stand a high chance of success, the Guardian has learned. Legal advice circulated within the UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA) is understood to warn that there is a risk of a challenge under equalities law.  The advice puts the chance of any challenge being successful at 50% to 70%. It says it could be argued that lower socioeconomic groups would be disadvantaged by the move to scrap confirmatory PCR Covid tests for everyone, if low-paid people were still required to get them in order to access £500 payments for support during isolation. “There is at least a medium-high 50-70% risk of successful challenge in the basis of equality and rationality grounds if we require individuals to have a confirmatory PCR to access TTSP [test-and-trace support] payments,” the advice says. “This is because it disproportionately impacts individuals from low-income backgrounds and if [lateral flow tests] are deemed to be sufficient from a public health and fraud perspective then to require all individuals to legally self-isolate then it is difficult to argue they should then [need a PCR test to] get access to the TTSP.” The move to scrap confirmatory PCR tests for asymptomatic people who test positive by self-reported lateral flow was announced this week. The exception is people on low pay who want to apply for Covid support payments, who are required to get confirmation because of the risk of fraudulent applications. It was also announced this week that PCR requirements would be scrapped for travellers arriving in the UK – a move that was opposed by the health secretary, Sajid Javid, on the grounds that it could set back detection of new variants coming in to the country. The Guardian revealed this week that Jenny Harries, the head of the UKHSA, had raised concerns about low-paid workers being disadvantaged by changes to the Covid testing regime in England. In a memo before Christmas, she highlighted a greater risk of false negatives for those on lower incomes forced to go to a testing centre to ensure they received the £500 Covid test-and-trace support payments. Harries wrote: “In higher prevalence periods, the abandonment of confirmatory PCR would mean that the people most likely to receive a false negative and therefore potentially become ill and then seek hospital care later and therefore more likely to die would be more likely to be those from lower socioeconomic groups who also have higher risk of underlying health conditions as additional risk factors.” The government made the changes partly to ease pressure on the PCR testing system while Covid case numbers are at an unprecedented level, and partly to allow people to start the clock on isolation periods earlier. However, there were also concerns among public health officials that a confirmatory PCR was counterproductive because of the risk of false negatives. Some experts have previously highlighted that there is still a reasonable chance of a person having Covid if they have a positive lateral flow followed by a negative PCR, with the PCR missing a positive result about one in 20 times. It is understood that data prepared for Javid this month contained estimates that about 9,000 out of 195,000 confirmatory PCR tests taken in November in England were false negatives. Out of 20,000 negatives overall, this suggested that 45% of all negative PCR results after a positive lateral flow result were false. In Wales, support payments are given out for self-reported tests without the need for a confirmatory PCR. It is difficult to quantify the number of people affected, but the House of Commons library found that about 370,000 support payments had been made by November. That means about 1 million applications are likely to have been made, because, based on previous data, the success rate is estimated to be about a third. The number of payments is likely to have risen again substantially during the latest wave of Covid. The UKHSA declined to comment on the leaked advice.",News/Politics,"Requiring PCR tests for isolation funds may fail legal test, UK officials told",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/08/pcr-tests-isolation-funds-legal-challenge
1/8/2022,"This could be the year of the jumbo-sized mortgage – for some UK homebuyers at least – as lenders loosen their purse strings and increase the maximum sums they are willing to offer. The mortgage lender Habito recently announced that it will let some buyers borrow up to seven times their salary – well above the traditional maximum – in order to help them “secure their dream home sooner”.  In the coming months a new lender called Perenna plans to launch mortgages of up to six times salary, and some experts believe other similar deals will emerge this year. Those who meet the criteria for these mortgages could be able to buy a property they might have assumed was well out of their price range – perhaps a home costing £200,000 more than they thought they could afford. Some might argue that letting people borrow more is the only realistic answer to the fact that years of soaring property values have left large numbers priced out of the market. The average price of a home is now 8.6 times average earnings, according to official data. However, these new deals are only open to certain borrowers and come with plenty of downsides – probably the biggest of which is that you may be able to get a much cheaper interest rate if you go for a standard deal. Just because a bank is prepared to “go large” on its lending doesn’t necessarily mean it is a good idea to sign up for a supersized mortgage. Banks and building societies look at various aspects of people’s finances when deciding how big a mortgage they think someone can afford to take out. Traditionally the typical maximum for how much someone can borrow is between four and five times their salary. This is known as the income multiple. In the years after the financial crisis of 2007-08, rules were tightened up to prevent a repeat of the reckless lending that some say was rife prior to the crash. The Bank of England imposed limits on mortgages of more than 4.5 times earnings: banks can offer higher income multiples but only on a set proportion of their lending. Last year a number of big lenders lifted their caps to 5.5 times salary for certain borrowers. Habito, which started as a mortgage broker in 2016 before launching into lending in 2019, is offering borrowing of up to an income multiple of seven times basic salary but not to everyone. The deals are only available to people who take out one of the company’s fixed-for-life mortgages. Launched last year under the Habito One brand, these let borrowers lock their monthly repayments at the same level for up to 40 years. Habito One is open to first-time buyers, home movers and remortgagers in England and Wales. You will need a 10% deposit (it says it hopes to launch a deal for those who can only manage 5% soon) and there is a chunky £1,995 product fee to pay. To qualify for the biggest loans available, applicants need to have one of the following jobs: teacher, firefighter, nurse, paramedic, doctor, police officer, accountant, barrister, engineer, lawyer, dentist, architect, surveyor or vet. They must also earn a minimum basic salary of £25,000 a year. Higher earners – those on a minimum £75,000 basic salary – who don’t have one of those jobs are also eligible. Single and joint applications will be considered, although if it is a couple, only one will be accepted for up to seven times salary, with the other at up to five times. At the time of writing, the Habito One rates without early repayment charges start at 2.99% (for a 15-year term where someone is borrowing 60% of the property’s value), rising to 5.6% (for a 40-year term where the applicant is borrowing 90%). The rates with early repayment charges – the tie-in period is 10 years – are slightly lower: from 2.79% to 5.4%. Perenna, meanwhile, plans to launch its fixed-for-life mortgages in the second half of this year, and says it will be letting homebuyers borrow up to six times their income. It intends to start with a 30-year fixed-rate, then launch 40- and 50-year fixes later. One of the big downsides of this new breed of mortgage offering fixed monthly payments for decades is that most people will be able to get a much lower interest rate if they go for a standard shorter-term deal such as a two- or five-year fix. With these, when the offer period ends, you simply move to another competitive deal. Elsewhere, rates for first-time buyers looking for a standard two-year fix up to 90% loan-to-value currently start at only 1.23%, according to the data provider Moneyfacts. But the lenders behind these fixed-for-life deals say that as your interest rate is guaranteed for the lifetime of your loan you are protected against any threat of fluctuating interest rates, and you won’t have to keep paying expensive product fees, perhaps every two or three years. Take a couple where both earn £25,000: if they went for a deal where borrowing was capped at 4.5 times their combined salary, they might be able to buy a home worth £250,000. If they went with, and qualified for, the Habito One deal, they could borrow seven times one salary and five times the other – allowing them to buy a home costing £333,000. For a solo applicant earning £75,000 whose borrowing was capped at 4.5 times income, they might be able to buy a home for £375,000. With this new deal, they could potentially purchase a property worth £560,000 (in this last example, it’s not quite the full seven times salary because of Habito’s rule that customers must have a minimum 10% cash left over in their accounts after all expenditure). (All of the examples assume a 10% deposit). Several big names – including Halifax, HSBC, Santander and Barclays – will now go up to 5.5 times income for high-earning borrowers, and will typically let those who are accepted access their entire range of standard mortgage deals. At Halifax, a maximum of 5.5 times salary will apply to those earning more than £75,000 who are borrowing up to £1m at less than 75% LTV. HSBC requires a salary of £100,000-plus, and the maximum loan is 90%. At Santander, it is a combined income for all applicants of £100,000 or more, with a maximum loan of 75%. With Barclays, at least one borrower must be on £75,000-plus, or the two highest-earning applicants must have a combined income of £100,000 or more, and the maximum loan is 85%. After the 2007-08 financial crisis, mortgages to first-time buyers in particular were immediately slashed but in recent years many lenders have eased lending restrictions. A further relaxation is on the cards: the Bank of England has announced it will consult on scrapping a rule that forces many borrowers to prove they could afford a big rise in interest rates before they can be approved for a mortgage. At the moment, with a typical two- or five-year deal, lenders must stress-test an applicant’s ability to repay their home loan at 3% above the standard variable rate that the borrower might go on to at the end of the initial period. This limits the amounts many people are able to borrow. The new breed of long-term fixed-rate mortgages avoid these restrictions because their interest rates are guaranteed for the lifetime of the loan. Perenna says: “There are no interest rate stress tests with long-term fixed-rate products, as borrowers are protected from any interest rate rises over the long term and won’t revert on to a lender’s higher SVR.”",Lifestyle/Money,"Supersize mortgages: can you get one, and what are the dangers?",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/08/supersize-mortgages-can-you-get-one-and-what-are-the-dangers
1/8/2022,"Conservative factions are nothing new, as Theresa May learned to her cost with Brexit and Boris Johnson saw in a mass rebellion on Covid rules. But Johnson is facing significant pressure from well over 100 of his MPs to change course on a number of fronts including green policies. Conservative backbenchers say an ever-growing number of factions – most with their own acronym, and with significant crossover when it comes to their members – hold sway within the party, a process helped by WhatsApp-based organising and a perception the prime minister’s authority has eroded.  “I’m on so many WhatsApp groups it’s like Ben-Hur – there’s a cast of thousands,” one MP said. “I can’t keep track of them all. It doesn’t mean I believe in everything, but I like to keep track of people’s views.” MPs feel empowered by the groups. “It’s often said that with first past the post, coalitions exist within parties rather than between parties,” another MP said. “Under Thatcher we used to have the wets and the drys. It can be a good counterbalance to the executive.” John Major struggled endlessly with Eurosceptics he termed “bastards”, while May’s nemesis was the European Research Group, or ERG, the longstanding alliance of Brexit ultras. What is different now is that – unlike Major and May – Johnson has a significant Commons majority. Nonetheless, before Christmas he still had to rely on Labour votes to pass new coronavirus restrictions amid a 101-MP rebellion instigated by the Covid Recovery Group (CRG), which is sceptical about new pandemic rules. Unlike the ERG, which has membership levies and a formal structure, CRG backers say it is little more than a WhatsApp forum with occasional in-person meetings. There is significant crossover, not least with Steve Baker, a former ERG chair who is vice-chair of the CRG. The ERG receded into the background after Johnson delivered the Brexit its members wanted, and the CRG could likewise call off hostilities if the Omicron wave subsides and rules are eased. Even then Johnson will not be in the clear. His parliamentary party’s internal groupings, while varied in core aims, often share certain views and some of the same members. These tend disproportionately to be former Brexiters, and common aims centre around a desire to push Johnson away from what they see as overly statist, high-tax policies – ones they believe the UK should abandon outside the EU. “It feels particularly important now, as we’ve had two years of a Conservative government and for some of us it hasn’t especially felt like a Conservative government,” one backbencher said. “We’re all facing re-election in a year or two, and we just want to gently nudge the government back to a virtuous path.” Some blocs, such as the Northern Research Group (NRG), are more geographic than ideological. But others, such as Blue Collar Conservatism and the culture war-focused Common Sense Group, have beliefs that include opposition to current elements of tax-and-spend. The Net Zero Scrutiny Group (NZSG), which claims many more supporters than the 18 Tory MPs who signed a letter this week seeking an end to VAT and green levies on fuel bills, looks set to become increasingly influential in coming months as Johnson faces pressure over the cost of living. Some critics have argued the NZSG flirts with denial, citing its pledge to consider research from Nigel Lawson’s controversial Global Warming Policy Foundation thinktank. Craig Mackinlay, the South Thanet MP who chairs the group, rejects the characterisation. He says: “This isn’t an argument about climate change or any of that. This is about: is this affordable and technologically achievable, what will it do particularly for the lower paid, and is there a better way?” There are repeated echoes of Brexit, and not just because many of the MPs involved cut their factional teeth inside the ERG. One backbencher, a member of several groups, says: “We know one reason people voted for Brexit was they felt elites were telling them how to live their lives. And I think there’s some similarities when they’re told: don’t have an old-fashioned boiler, don’t drive a 15-year-old car or van even though you can’t afford another one. It’s the same with Covid – officials in London telling them what to do.” Some MPs crop up time and again. The Lincoln MP, Karl McCartney, for example, is in the CRG, NZRG and Common Sense Group, as well being on the executive of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tories. The Wealden MP, Nusrat Ghani, is vice-chair of the 1922 Committee and involved with the CRG, while the former minister Esther McVey is linked to the CRG and NZSG and founded Blue Collar Conservatism. Much as Johnson succeeded May by positioning himself to Tory MPs and the party membership as the man to deliver a muscular, immediate Brexit, those now hoping to follow him, such as Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, will look to the groups for ideological pointers. In the meantime, Johnson must try to keep them on side, mindful they have the ability to cause significant trouble. “You don’t throw yourself on the barbed wire every time there’s a vote,” noted one Tory MP, a member of several groups. “But you have a greater opportunity to get in front of ministers and argue the case – because they know you’ve got some cards in your pocket.”",News/Politics,"ERG out, CRG in: the Tory factions Boris Johnson is struggling to appease",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/08/erg-out-crg-tory-factions-boris-johnson-struggling-appease
1/8/2022,"The House select committee investigating the Capitol attack is examining whether Donald Trump oversaw a criminal conspiracy on 6 January that connected the White House’s scheme to stop Joe Biden’s certification with the insurrection, say two senior sources familiar with the matter.  The committee’s new focus on the potential for a conspiracy marks an aggressive escalation in its inquiry as it confronts evidence that suggests the former president potentially engaged in criminal conduct egregious enough to warrant a referral to the justice department. House investigators are interested in whether Trump oversaw a criminal conspiracy after communications turned over by Trump’s former chief of staff Mark Meadows and others suggested the White House coordinated efforts to stop Biden’s certification, the sources said. The select committee has several thousand messages, among which include some that suggest the Trump White House briefed a number of House Republicans on its plan for then-vice president Mike Pence to abuse his ceremonial role and not certify Biden’s win, the sources said. The fact that the select committee has messages suggesting the Trump White House directed Republican members of Congress to execute a scheme to stop Biden’s certification is significant as it could give rise to the panel considering referrals for potential crimes, the sources said. Members and counsel on the select committee are examining in the first instance whether in seeking to stop the certification, Trump and his aides violated the federal law that prohibits obstruction of a congressional proceeding – the joint session on 6 January – the sources said. The select committee believes, the sources said, that Trump may be culpable for an obstruction charge given he failed for hours to intervene to stop the violence at the Capitol perpetrated by his supporters in his name. But the select committee is also looking at whether Trump oversaw an unlawful conspiracy that involved coordination between the “political elements” of the White House plan communicated to Republican lawmakers and extremist groups that stormed the Capitol, the sources said. That would probably be the most serious charge for which the select committee might consider a referral, as it considers a range of other criminal conduct that has emerged in recent weeks from obstruction to potential wire fraud by the GOP. The vice-chair of the select committee, the Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney, referenced the obstruction charge when she read from the criminal code before members voted unanimously last November to recommend Meadows in contempt of Congress for refusing to testify. The Guardian previously reported that Trump personally directed lawyers and political operatives working from the Willard hotel in Washington DC to find ways to stop Biden’s certification from happening at all on 6 January just hours before the Capitol attack. But House investigators are yet to find evidence tying Trump personally to the Capitol attack, the sources said, and may ultimately only recommend referrals for the straight obstruction charge, which has already been brought against around 275 rioters, rather than for conspiracy. The justice department could yet charge Trump and aides separate to the select committee investigation, but one of sources said the panel – as of mid-December – had no idea whether the agency is actively examining potential criminality by the former president. A spokesperson for the select committee declined to comment on details about the investigation. A spokesperson for the justice department declined to comment whether the agency had opened a criminal inquiry for Trump or his closest allies over 6 January. Still, the select committee appears to be moving towards making at least some referrals – or alternatively recommendations in its final report – that an aggressive prosecutor at the justice department could use to pursue a criminal inquiry, the sources said. The select committee is examining the evidence principally to identify legislative reforms to prevent a repeat of Trump’s plan to subvert the election, but members say if they find Trump violated federal law, they have an obligation to refer that to the justice department. Sending a criminal referral to the justice department – essentially a recommendation for prosecution – carries no formal legal weight since Congress lacks the authority to force it to open a case, and House investigators have no authority to charge witnesses with a crime. But a credible criminal referral from the select committee could have a substantial political effect given the importance of the 6 January inquiry, and place pressure on the attorney general, Merrick Garland, to initiate an investigation, or explain why he might not do so. ​​Internal discussions about criminal referrals intensified after communications turned over by Meadows revealed alarming lines of communication between the Trump White House and Republican lawmakers over 6 January, the sources said. In one exchange released by the select committee, one Republican lawmaker texted Meadows an apology for not pulling off what might have amounted to a coup, saying 6 January was a “terrible day” not because of the attack, but because they were unable to stop Biden’s certification. The select committee believes messages such as that text – as well as remarks from a Republican on the House floor as the Capitol came under attack – might represent one part of a conspiracy by the White House to obstruct the joint session, the sources said. In referencing objections to six states, the text also appears to comport with a memo authored by the Trump lawyer John Eastman that suggested lodging objections to six states – raising the specter the White House distributed the plan more widely than previously known. Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the select committee, added on ABC last week that the investigation had found evidence to suggest the events of 6 January “appeared to be a coordinated effort on the part of a number of people to undermine the election”. Counsel for the select committee indicated in their contempt of Congress report for Meadows that they intended to ask Trump’s former chief of staff about those communications he turned over voluntarily, before he broke off a cooperation deal and refused to testify. Thompson has also suggested to reporters that he believes Meadows stopped cooperating with the inquiry in part because of pressure from Trump, but the select committee has not opened a separate witness intimidation investigation into the former president, one of the sources said.",News/US news,Capitol attack panel investigates Trump over potential criminal conspiracy,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/08/capitol-attack-committee-donald-trump-white-house-stop-biden-win
