5/9/2022,"With there being plenty of reasons not to vote Tory, and very few to vote Labour, Jonathan Freedland’s excellent advice needs to be heeded (Here’s what we have learned: Starmer can’t dazzle like Blair, but might still rid us of Johnson, 6 May). Of course, they should “talk a bit less” about the Tories’ incompetence and “a bit more about what Labour will do” and, perhaps Freedland could have added, listen less to current advisers. Why isn’t Starmer being properly prepared for interviews, so that, instead of Tory-like obfuscation and avoidance tactics, there could be clarity and detailed answers? Questions about how, in view of opposition to recent national insurance rises, Labour would raise the £12bn, or about the 10 pledges he made in the leadership campaign, are inevitable, so the answers should be practised. Didn’t anyone on his team watch The West Wing? How can they expect to overtake Tories as the party most trusted with the economy if their leader will not disclose any fiscal plans? Starmer may not dazzle, as Freedland says, but he doesn’t have to look like a disgruntled 1950s farmer brought in from the haymaking to attend a wedding, as he did on last week’s party political broadcast. Is it any wonder the turnout was low? The trouble is that it will be similar in the general election unless the advice for Starmer improves.Bernie EvansLiverpool  Well, it’s a step in the right direction for Labour, but it ought to have been so much better. Jonathan Freedland hits the nail on the head. Apart from the one-off windfall tax (though even that is poorly sold by not emphasising that it’s about excess profits) there is little of substance to separate Labour from the disastrous Tory non-policies, with vague references to tackling the cost of living crisis and not imposing the NI increase. It is little wonder that voters stayed away in even larger numbers than usual since there was a lot to vote against but little to vote for. Labour, having distanced itself from Jeremy Corbyn and his -istas, is still scared to do anything that might frighten the horses. Where, for example, are the proposals for a fair income tax system that requires the rich to pay their fair share, a wealth tax, council tax reform, a realistic replacement for the shameful social care mess, a reintroduction of Sure Start and many other policies that would be popular if properly explained? Based on similar horse-frightening fears, there is Labour’s pathetic Make Brexit Work mantra when it is patently obvious that Brexit does not work and, even over Jacob Rees-Mogg’s 50-year timescale, never will. Labour should at least be firmly in favour of rejoining the single market and explaining the reasons, not the least of which is resolving the debacle in Northern Ireland.Alan HealeyBaschurch, Shropshire  I weep over comments that Starmer does not “dazzle”. Alas, upcoming young voters have known nothing else but celebrity and charisma. Old folk like me look for someone to lead who is able, honest, who puts the needs of ordinary people first, and who can make articulate speeches with meaning and worthwhile purpose. Starmer ticks these boxes, to say the least. How utterly sad that these attributes are no longer fashionable.Betty RosenLondon  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

5/9/2022,"The equation for Arsenal is tantalisingly, terrifyingly simple. If they win at Spurs on Thursday they will confirm a return to Champions League football. There was ample cause here both for intense optimism and profound caution. Leeds may not have helped themselves during an abject first half, but they were still blown away by the insistent, emphatic tempo set by Mikel Arteta’s players. Eddie Nketiah, whose future remains in doubt, added fuel to that particular debate with two early goals; Luke Ayling’s subsequent dismissal seemed to effectively end the contest but, remarkably, Arsenal were hanging on by the end of the game. Diego Llorente ensured the last 25 minutes were far nervier than they should have been, and Arsenal’s propensity to usher their opposition towards a glimmer of daylight remains a problem. If Nketiah was preparing a prospectus for a new contract, whether at the Emirates or elsewhere, he would not find two better summations of his gifts than these. While the first goal was an embarrassment for Illan Meslier, who had already shown early jitters in fumbling a Martin Ødegaard free-kick, it would not have been possible without Nketiah’s sheer hunger and nose for a mistake. Ayling’s pass back to Meslier, one of the right-back’s few accurate contributions during his time on the pitch, could have been cleared easily but the keeper took a touch and let it run across his body. He showed far too much of it to Nketiah, who had eaten up the ground to capitalise and was able to swipe it into the net from a few yards. That was Nketiah by numbers, but it was also the kind of opportunity Arsenal would not create without him. Before 10 minute had elapsed he poached another, stationing himself 10 yards out as Gabriel Martinelli, showing admirable ball control but still getting away with extraordinary ease, escaped down the left. The cutback was accurate and Nketiah, mystifyingly unmarked, could clip in a regulation finish. Arsenal should have scored plenty more after that and the narrow scoreline cannot mask a largely catastrophic showing from Leeds that leaves them in the bottom three, with Chelsea up next. Relegation looms large. In their previous game they had, at least, got up close and personal with Manchester City before being brushed aside; here they were a mess from the kick off and it spoke volumes that, the first time one of their players got conspicuously close to one of his opponents, he misjudged it badly enough to be dismissed. It is hard to contend Ayling’s red card made much difference to the outcome, but it was a snapshot of what had gone so wrong. Ayling, who began his career at Arsenal, had been roasted by Martinelli for Nketiah’s second goal and fared little better when trying to track two subsequent runs. When Martinelli showed characteristic speed and appetite to keep a long, raking pass in play near the left sideline, Ayling hurtled over and it was as if he had decided it was time to show the Brazilian that he was in the game. Chris Kavanagh, the referee, initially concluded Ayling had simply gone in too hard while taking the ball. A yellow card was shown but the challenge’s force had been considerable and it did not take the most pedantic of VAR reruns to show that he had launched into Martinelli with two feet, leaping off the ground for traction and ploughing through his man. There was no chance the original decision would be upheld and, once Kavanagh had run to his monitor, the die was cast. From there the outstanding questions seemed to be whether Arsenal would settle for two and if Leeds, who seemed happy to keep it at that given Jesse Marsch immediately replaced Joe Gelhardt with Pascal Struijk, could keep 10 men on the pitch. Meslier’s continuing skittishness suggested the former would remain in doubt: he flapped at a corner and saved uncomfortably from an Ødegaard free-kick, although he fared slightly better in deflecting Martinelli’s angled effort away with a foot. Arsenal’s second half should have been a stroll in the sun, although perhaps the fact it was turning into one became a problem. The irrepressible Martinelli drew a genuinely good save from Meslier, lifted over and then sliced wide. Leeds’ supporters were determined their club would emerge with at least some credit. They waved white scarves and made the lion’s share of the noise; in the 66th minute they roared to acclaim a rare corner and must have been astonished when, after Junior Firpo had flicked on, Llorente converted at the far post. It was Leeds’ first goal attempt. From nowhere, a familiar jitteriness rippled around Arsenal’s home. Ødegaard could have calmed it but shot wide. Meslier went up for two set pieces and was at close quarters when Aaron Ramsdale saved a last-gasp Rodrigo flick.

5/9/2022,"Everton recorded a precious victory in their fight for Premier League survival and a first away from Goodison Park since August to rise to 16th, a point above the relegation zone. They also have the ammunition of a game in hand on those below them after brushing aside a lacklustre Leicester, who seemed hungover from their European exit in midweek. A thunderbolt from Vitalii Mykolenko put them on their way before a calamitous mixup between Yerry Mina and Seamus Coleman allowed Patson Daka to level, but Everton restored their lead through Mason Holgate as Leicester’s vulnerabilities at set pieces surfaced once more, four days from Tammy Abraham’s headed winner in Rome. Brendan Rodgers’s side have conceded 23 times from set plays this season, including 18 goals from corners. For Everton, who again had Jordan Pickford to thank for a catalogue of fine saves, successive victories for the first time since September breathes life into their hopes of staying up. Frank Lampard’s side took the lead in style through Mykolenko, the Ukraine full-back lashing a sweet left-foot volley into the top corner after meeting Alex Iwobi’s cross on the edge of Leicester’s 18-yard box. The joy proved short-lived as Leicester hit back in comical fashion five minutes later, seconds after Abdoulaye Doucoure almost doubled Everton’s advantage. Doucoure started the move, striding forward on halfway and freeing the former Leicester winger Demarai Gray, before bursting into the box. He latched on to Gray’s teasing cross and Kasper Schmeichel just about kept his effort out of the Leicester net, requiring a helping hand from a post, before launching the ball downfield to Iheanacho, whose pass ballooned into the sky. At that point a slapstick moment unfolded. Mina and Coleman collided as they went for the same bouncing ball and the pair ended up allowing Daka to race clean through and finish. But on the half hour Everton regained the lead, feasting on more slack set-piece defending by Leicester. Richarlison crashed a free header towards goal from Gray’s outswinging corner and Schmeichel was unable to palm the ball to safety, with Holgate on hand in the six-yard box to head in. Rodgers threw his right fist to the ground and shook his head in disbelief. As Anthony Gordon received treatment approaching the interval, the Everton supporters packed into the corner of this ground made their voices heard. Leicester, meanwhile, were booed off at half-time. Leicester looked lost and seemed to run out of ideas. Youri Tielemans’ aimless pass upfield midway through the second half, which was gobbled up by Pickford, offered a microcosm of a painstaking performance. It is now seven games without victory for Brendan Rodgers, whose side were laboured and a pale imitation of the one that upset PSV in Eindhoven last month. The hosts turned to Jamie Vardy for inspiration, the striker arriving off the bench on 66 minutes, but it was the half-time substitute, Harvey Barnes, who went close a couple of minutes later. Daka kept Kelechi Iheanacho’s cross alive at the back post and Barnes prodded the ball goalwards but Pickford flew low down to his left to make a save. Barnes tried his luck from outside the box but the result was the same and late on sent a header narrowly wide from a Timothy Castagne cross. The pained, impassioned expression on Pickford’s face said it all.",Sport/Football,Mason Holgate seals Everton’s precious win over lacklustre Leicester,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/08/leicester-everton-premier-league-match-report

5/9/2022,"Members of Ukraine’s Azov battalion trapped inside Mariupol’s Azovstal steel plant have said they fear they will be executed if captured by Russian forces, as they pleaded with Ukrainian authorities to help arrange their extraction. Speaking to the media from inside the besieged steelworks, an Azov commander and lieutenant, looking gaunt and pale, said they had defended the city for the people of Ukraine and the rest of the world and needed a third party to negotiate their exit whether by land or sea. There are believed to be 2,000 soldiers in the plant, 700 of whom are said to be injured. Lieut Illya Samoilenko vowed to fight on, saying his comrades understood they would be executed if captured and that surrender would be a “gift” to the enemy. “We are witnesses of Russian crimes,” Samoilenko said. “Surrender is not an option because Russia is not interested in our lives.” All the civilians who were inside the plant have been evacuated, according to Azov’s commander, Denys Prokopenko. “We need the proper opportunity to be evacuated,” Svyatoslav Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov regiment. “Another thing that hurts is that the politicians said you continue (fighting) while we evacuate the civilians. But we (are) here defending the people.” They criticised the Ukrainian government for celebrating the evacuation of several dozen civilians over the past few weeks, while failing to prepare Ukraine over the past eight years for what they say was an inevitable war with Russia. “The government let this happen to 25,000 people,” said Samoilenko, speaking of the number of civilians in Mariupol that he estimates have died. Azov forces say they are more than 100km from the nearest Ukrainian forces and cannot make it to safety without help from Ukraine’s authorities. The Azov battalion has been central to Russia’s justification for invading Ukraine. Russia claims its members are neo-Nazis who are responsible for “Nazifying” Ukraine. Azov fighters say its membership holds a range of political opinions. Azov formed as a volunteer battalion in 2014 to fight Russian-backed forces and some its leaders are known to hold far-right views. But since 2015, it has been part of the Ukrainian army and no longer attracts only far-right combatants. Russian propaganda has long exaggerated the domestic influence of Azov in Ukraine as well as the scale of its membership. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has worked to transform the image of the fighters in the eyes internationally and in Ukraine. Many now view them as heroes. Samoilenko said they felt supported by words but asked for aerial attacks on Russian positions and berated the Ukrainian authorities for not defending Ukraine’s southern regions. “We are doing our job and we are doing our job well. Some of the politicians are not doing their job well,” said Samoilenko, who also said Azov had killed 2,500 Russian soldiers from 24 February to 25 April. Samoilenko said the weak reaction of the world to Russian aggression in 2014 is one of the reasons why this invasion had happened. He said western countries should have understood that the price of prosperity in Europe had been 15,000 Ukrainian lives in the last eight years, referring to the 2014-22 war. He said the west had refused to help the battalion over the last eight years. Some of those who led Azov in its inception as a volunteer battalion in 2014 were of far-right leanings. The battalion was incorporated into Ukraine’s army in 2015 and its members are now politically pluralistic. “We showed that anything is possible,” said Samoilenko. “Please do your job and so we can teach people how to do impossible things.” Samoilenko also criticised the Ukrainian government for negotiating with Russia, describing them as “barbarians”. He said Azov’s goal was to eliminate the enemy threat by pacifying Russia and that they were not only fighting for Ukraine but the whole of the free world. Samoilenko declined to say how many soldiers were left in the plant or talk about their supplies, saying that this was classified operational information. The fighters say morale is still high, despite coming under almost constant shelling. “We’re grateful for the support from the world and this might help,” said Samoilenko “People have seen who we are.” ",News/World news,‘Surrender is not an option’: Azov battalion commander in plea for help to escape Mariupol,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/08/surrender-is-not-an-option-azov-battalion-commander-in-plea-for-help-to-escape-mariupol

5/9/2022,"Every weekday Andrew Murkin comes to Downham Market library for books, wifi and – most importantly – warmth. Murkin, who is 63 and receives disability benefits, lives in a bungalow in the Norfolk town and as his energy bills rose this winter he decided to heat only one room for two hours a day. “In the winter I come to the library to keep warm,” he said. “I like to get up early. But sitting at home is miserable in the cold.” At weekends, when his local library is mostly closed, he has few options. “In winter I just sit at home with my coat on and a duvet on,” he said. “I’ve been wearing two T-shirts, two jumpers and a coat inside. A lot of my friends do the same.” The plight of Elsie, a 77-year-old who ate one meal a day and travelled on buses to stay warm, became emblematic of the cost of living crisis after Boris Johnson was confronted with her story in a Good Morning Britain interview. Her case has highlighted the challenges faced by older people unable to meet the cost of rising bills. In Downham Market, near King’s Lynn, the library is a lifeline for older and vulnerable people looking for somewhere warm to pass time without spending money. The south of the town has the ward with the highest proportion of pensioners in England and Wales, with 57% over-65. Many of them rely on the library. Murkin is the first person to arrive at its Just a Cuppa session on Friday morning, a weekly event offering free tea and biscuits. He used to work as a welder before problems with his diabetes and mobility two years ago made that too difficult. “It’s hard getting by on the money you get on benefits,” he said. He has moved his bed into the living room so that he only needs to heat one room. “I go to bed a lot earlier than I used to just to keep warm,” he said. This winter the library introduced free Keep Warm and Go bags packed with everything someone may need who was struggling to keep the cold away, including gloves, thermals, a scarf, blanket and a hat. Fran Valentine, the library’s manager, said it had proved popular. “We’ve had a lot of people coming in and picking them up,” she said. When Joan Mulholland, 89, found out last month her energy bills were due to increase again, she panicked. “I rang up the company and said: ‘I’m not going to be able to afford £200 a month.’” She gets by on a state pension and is worried it will not be enough this winter. “I’m thinking of stopping my TV licence off to pay for the heating,” she said. “My weekly food bill has gone up by about £2 a week and I’ve cut back as much as I can.” Her late husband, Adrian, used to manufacture electrical parts and was also on a state pension. Since he died of cancer three years ago she has found it harder to meet the costs of running the bungalow they shared in the south of the town. “It’s very difficult because I live on my own. I have to watch things like not putting too much water in the kettle. Lighting the oven for one meal works out very expensive when there’s only one of you, so I’m going to move to salads and not cook too much.” She tries to heat the house as little as possible to save up for the coming winter. “Getting older you feel the cold much more and it’s very hard sometimes to sit there and think: ‘Well, I can’t turn on the heating.’” Alex Coates, who runs the town’s food bank, says demand has soared since March as the cost of petrol, food and energy increased. “It’s not just people on benefits, it’s two-parent families who are both working and they are struggling to decide whether to feed their children, put fuel in their car or heat their homes. That’s the dilemma a lot of families are facing,” she said. Most of the people coming to them are parents with children and she worries that pensioners are suffering in silence. “That age group is very proud. We only really find out about them if they’ve been referred to us by a doctor or adult social services,” she said. They are planning to bulk-buy hot-water bottles to give out before next winter, “so when people boil the kettle for their tea they can put the water that’s left in them to keep warm”. Jill, 69, a former nursery worker, is the second to arrive at the library for tea. She has few savings and is reliant on her pension. She has cut right back to make the costs add up. “I only have the heating and hot water on for an hour in the morning and then I get out in the garden and dig,” she said. “I go to bed early with an electric blanket. If I didn’t have that it would be terrible.”",News/Society,‘I come to the library to keep warm’: Norfolk residents battling fuel poverty,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/08/downham-market-library-norfolk-residents-fuel-poverty-older-vulnerable-money
5/9/2022,"Boris Johnson should, by rights, be fighting for his political survival this week. He has taken a thumping majority any Tory leader would envy and blown it in just over two years, with precious little to show for all that squandered goodwill except the threat of a recession, rocketing inflation, a personal reputation dragged through the gutter and the future prospect of not one but two breakaway movements from the United Kingdom. On Thursday he paid the price, with Tory remainers turning on him throughout what were once his party’s southern heartlands. Yet the big Sunday headline following the elections wasn’t the beginnings of a coup against the man who lost 500 odd seats. It was trouble, instead, for the man who won a lot of them. A mysterious “insider” present when Keir Starmer shared a takeaway curry and a beer with the Labour MP Mary Foy and their respective teams on the campaign trail last April is now reportedly willing to tell police that this wasn’t purely the working dinner that lockdown rules required. Two anonymous former members of Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow cabinet have helpfully suggested that if (and, as Diane Abbott pointed out when she was asked the same question, it’s an extremely big if) Starmer were fined for any of this, he would have to quit. The net result is that Tories who claimed to be “waiting for the local election results” to tell them what they surely already knew about Johnson have yet another excuse to put off a painful leadership contest, namely waiting to see if Labour will helpfully have one instead. Whatever old scores may be being settled in the background here, one can only hope those involved think it was worth it. For, however short-lived this diversion to Durham may prove, it’s got Johnson through a dangerous weekend, while effectively neutralising any opposition attack if he himself gets fined again for lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street. Meanwhile, the longer-term strategy for the next general election is visibly taking shape: deflect from the sleaze by suggesting that everyone else was at it too, throw red meat at the “red wall” (Downing Street’s new deputy chief of staff, David Canzini, is said to have praised Priti Patel’s crude and potentially unworkable Rwanda policy as a model for other departments to follow in his post-election briefing) and use predictions of a hung parliament, just as David Cameron did in 2015, to tell wobbling Tories that voting Labour or Lib Dem risks letting the SNP in the back door. It’s all about recasting weaknesses as strengths, fiction as fact, setbacks as victories in the making, or at least something for which you’ve already planned a solution – as Michael Gove did by suggesting that the Tories were hammered at the ballot box not because of Partygate or the cost of living but because home ownership is too low, something next week’s Queen’s speech will conveniently promise to tackle. And yes, it’s breathtakingly cynical. But so much of politics is about playing the hand you’re dealt, and even a battered Conservative party seemingly still remembers how to play lousy cards like they’re aces. And Labour? Early on Friday I wrote that Starmer had done well but not quite well enough to deliver something seismic at the next election; that the process of reinventing the party for rapidly changing times felt only half-finished. That still feels true. It’s a reasonable enough set of cards to hold at this stage in the game, but it needs playing boldly, with the kind of bounce and confidence that makes it look like a winner. There are undoubtedly Labour MPs who might see a sudden unexpected departure for Starmer as a chance to upgrade, although the idea touted in some circles that a Starmer resignation could somehow force Johnson into quitting too seems at best woefully naive. (Everything we know about the prime minister suggests he’s more likely to go in gleefully studs up on the opposition’s still-twitching corpse than choose this moment to be gracious.) But there is more than enough anti-Tory sentiment building now to sweep Johnson from office, if Labour can work smartly with the smaller progressive parties to harness it and find ways of connecting more viscerally with voters. If that project still feels half-finished, then Labour’s job now is to pull together and attempt to finish it. Lapsing back into the pursuit of internal grievances – whether that’s rightwing calls for a purge of Corbynite MPs or score-settling from a hard left still bitter about the way Corbyn was treated – merely looks self-indulgent to millions of people who just crave an alternative to the bleak future currently on offer. Starmer supporters often point to Joe Biden’s presidential victory as the model for a mild-mannered moderate triumphing over a splashy, attention-seeking populist. But Biden’s campaign united a divided American left, at least temporarily, against their common enemy, with a grassroots movement that had served Bernie Sanders working for a Biden victory and Biden carefully acknowledging some of its aims. However well you may or may not think a Biden presidency has turned out, it beats a second term of Donald Trump, and a similarly pragmatic calculation faces the British left now. There’s been a lot of talk lately of progressive alliances, embracing the resurgent Lib Dems and advancing Greens. But perhaps the most urgent step is for Labour to call a long overdue truce, once and for all, with itself.

However, in a league which has struggled to find competitiveness from top to bottom, instances of the traditional top three of Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal dropping points against any other club have been a rarity. Instead, in a league of 12 teams and only 22 fixtures, the games between that triumvirate have often been critical to the destination of the trophy. Not so much this season. The pattern of this campaign has been different and Chelsea’s path to a third consecutive title has been far more chequered. OK, “far more” may be an exaggeration. Last season Chelsea lost once and drew three times on the way to 57 points. In the Covid-stunted 2019-20 season they were unbeaten, collecting three draws on the way to a title awarded on the basis of points-per-game. This season has not been hugely different, with Hayes’s side losing twice and drawing twice to finish on 56 points. In the 12 seasons of the WSL (including the mini Spring Series that slotted in as the Football Association shifted the league from summer to winter), championship-winning teams have endured defeats against teams outside the traditional top three just five times. Chelsea’s record against the club’s main rivals in the five seasons they have won the league has also been remarkably consistent, with Hayes’s side losing only twice, against City in the Spring Series and at Arsenal this season. What felt different this season was the lack of swagger to the title. For the first time in a long time, no team has looked infallible. Even when title-winning teams have slipped up in recent years, there has seemed to be an inevitability to their eventual title party. Last season Chelsea’s sole defeat, against Brighton, was a shock but proved merely a blip in an otherwise blistering and swashbuckling run. This season the reigning champions dropped four points to a title rival, Arsenal, drew with Brighton and were defeated at Reading. Instead of leading from the front, Chelsea have spent much of the season chasing Arsenal. A goal difference of 59 last season has been trimmed to 51 during this campaign. And the Blues have had to work harder to grind out results. Pernille Harder’s controversial penalty was all that separated them from Birmingham last Sunday. In the recent double-header against Tottenham, they had to come from behind after having a player sent off to win three gritty points at the Hive, before a narrow 2-1 win at Kingsmeadow thanks to a Sam Kerr header. Against Aston Villa in March, Kerr’s 90th-minute goal kept their title aspirations alive and felt like a critical moment. “In crisis I think my team do really well,” Hayes said after the 3-1 win against Tottenham. “There’s rarely times in the last few years [where] in crisis we go under. I thought that was an amazing display of courage, confidence, conviction, togetherness, camaraderie. “It was the calmest dressing room in the world at half-time. Ever since Villa it’s been extremely calm, in terms of, as it’s getting hectic, keep making the right decision, keep adjusting; and we do a lot of work off the pitch. Today was a victory for all the work we do behind the scenes.” This is the key piece of the puzzle. Hayes’s team have faced more adversity than in recent years – the absence of Fran Kirby with fatigue, Kerr and Ji So-yun’s Asia Cup exploits in January, injuries to key players such as the captain, Magda Eriksson, and Harder – but the players have been equipped with a belief that means that they do not lie down, and they are also able to problem-solve during a game. It is no accident that Hayes’s squad is littered with international captains. Her recruitment focuses on picking the right characters for the way she wants her team to operate, and that means picking players that can read and understand the game as well as communicate – characteristics of all good leaders. While Arsenal have wilted under pressure, Hayes’s side have thrived. Her team, though, are a more evolved one. Players such as Kerr and Harder, recruited to lift Chelsea to another level, now have a couple of seasons under their belts. With Manchester City having overcome their early difficulties and Arsenal still developing under Jonas Eidevall, next season’s title defence will be even tougher.",Sport/Football,"Courage, confidence, conviction: how Chelsea won a third straight WSL title | Suzanne Wrack",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/08/courage-confidence-conviction-how-chelsea-won-a-third-straight-wsl-title
5/9/2022,"Would you ever wear shoes made from “grape leather”? Or gloves in “cactus leather”? What about a “kombucha leather” jacket and a “mushroom leather” bag? With the drive towards more sustainable fashion, the burgeoning world of animal-free “alt leathers” is becoming increasingly mainstream. This week saw the launch of new sustainable trainer brand Lerins, from Dune founder Daniel Rubin, including £130 shoes made with a leather-like material created from grape skins left over from wine-making. So-called “plant-based leather” promises multiple wins for the planet. Not only is Lerins upcycling an existing waste stream (as is also the case for “leathers” made from apples, bananas and pineapples), it’s also disconnecting from the cattle industry, and with that, the issues of greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation and animal welfare. Lerins joins a growing number of brands working with plant-based leather alternatives, among them Allbirds, Hermès, Reformation and Stella McCartney. And it’s not just “plant-based leather” that is getting attention. This week Leonardo DiCaprio and Kering, parent company of fashion brands such as Gucci, Saint Laurent and Balenciaga, this week invested “significant” sums in the Californian lab-grown leather startup VitroLabs. The process of lab-grown leather involves the cultivation of stem-cells in order to replicate animal hides, thus the leather is expected to be as strong and long-lasting as conventional leather. “We’re at a turning point,” says the American journalist and author, Dana Thomas. “When I wrote Fashionopolis [in 2019, covering the future of sustainable fashion], this was in the testing phase, now it’s being rolled out commercially – it’s thrilling to see it happening.” This August, Stella McCartney is launching grape leather shoes and handbags, and later this year, a mushroom leather bag, made from mycelium, the root structure of mushrooms. Allbirds’ first plant leather shoes, made with vegetable oil and natural rubber, are expected “in due course”. Nicole Rawling, the CEO of the California-based charity Material Innovation Initiative, which brings together brands, scientists and investors to accelerate this next generation of animal-free materials, says last year $980m of funding was raised for fabrics that replace animal-based materials (including silk and wool). However, it’s proving hard for plant-based leather alternatives to compete with the durability of bovine leather, which is problematic if it affects a product’s lifespan. Take plant-based shoes, says Dr Laetitia Forst, postdoctoral researcher of sustainable fashion at the University of the Arts London. “Even if their initial impact is lower, if you’re having to replace them every year as opposed to every 10 years, their overall impact will be much higher.” The solution, so far, has been – controversially – plastic. Many of these leather alternatives use a polyurethane (PU) coating in order to improve durability. (Both McCartney and Lerins work with the biomaterial company Vegea, which uses a water-based polyurethane, and says it is “the most environmentally responsible polyurethane available”; Allbirds claims its “plant leather” is 100% plastic-free.) “If you’re combining natural and synthetic materials, there will be issues at the end-of-life stage,” says Philippa Grogan of Eco-Age. “The plastics will compromise a product’s biodegradability.” There is no question that the plant-based leather industry wants to crack this problem: “No one is happy to have petrochemicals in their products,” says Rawling. She is optimistic that competition will force companies to develop more sustainable solutions.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Shoes made from grapes and mushroom handbags: the rise of animal-free leather,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/may/08/animal-free-leather-sustainable-fashion
5/9/2022,"Amesmerised hush fell over the crowd as João Camarero took to the stage with his seven-string guitar and plucked the opening notes of a national anthem that has become a symbol of the political struggle for Brazil’s soul. “O land adored above all others, ’tis thee, Brazil,” sang the South American songstress beside him, Teresa Cristina, as thousands of spectators added their voices to the hymn’s call for a future of liberty and love. Behind the musicians stood the man the audience hoped could make that dream reality: the former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who on Saturday announced he would seek to return to power in October’s election so as to end what he called Jair Bolsonaro’s era of tyranny, destruction and hate. “Brazil needs to go back to being a normal country,” the 76-year-old leftwinger told elated supporters at a rally in São Paulo, many visibly moved by the rendition of a national anthem that has been appropriated by Bolsonaro’s far-right movement and which, along with the presidency, progressive Brazilians want to reclaim. It was time, Lula declared, for Brazil to decide whether it wished to be a country of democracy or authoritarianism; truth or lies; tolerance or obscurantism; education or automatic rifles; environmental preservation or depredation. “Never was it easier to choose – and never was it so important to make the right choice,” he said. There was euphoria below the stage as the ex-president, who governed from 2003 to 2011, outlined plans to build a more stable and compassionate country from the wreckage of Bolsonaro’s “reckless and criminal” rule under which Amazon deforestation has soared and more than 660,000 lives been lost to Covid-19. “I feel I’m part of history … and we feel happy to be on the right side of history,” said Maria de Lourdes, a retired bank clerk who clutched a crêpe paper flower symbolising her yearning for change. Polls suggest Lula should comfortably beat Bolsonaro, a Donald Trump-admiring nationalist whose radical rhetoric and calamitous coronavirus response mean he is abominated by many of Brazil’s 215 million citizens. But analysts, and Lula allies, say Bolsonaro is a formidable political opponent with a ferociously loyal support base representing perhaps 25% of voters. To ensure victory, they believe the former president must build an invincible pro-democracy coalition stretching all the way from the hard-left to the centre-right. “It’s important not just that Lula wins, but that Bolsonaro loses badly,” said the political columnist Celso Rocha de Barros, who fears that in the event of a narrow Lula victory Bolsonaro will refuse to concede, alleging fraud, and launch a coup to supposedly “reestablish democracy”. Lula’s mission advanced at the weekend with the unveiling of his anti-Bolsonaro alliance, Vamos Juntos Pelo Brasil (Let’s Pull Together for Brazil). The bloc currently includes seven leftwing and centre-left parties and hopes to expand between now and the 2 October vote. As a gesture of his unifying intentions, Lula named Geraldo Alckmin, the centre-right former governor of São Paulo and a one-time presidential rival, as his running mate. When the Guardian last interviewed Alckmin the year was 2006 and the moderate conservative was trekking through Rio’s largest favela in search of votes to defeat Lula in that year’s presidential election. “Brazil has not grown,” Alckmin said of Lula’s first term in power, blaming his opponent for economic stagnation. Times have changed. On Saturday, Alckmin urged voters to back his once-improbable partnership with Brazil’s first working-class leader. “Lula … isn’t the first, second or third way,” Alckmin said. “He’s the only way [to end] the most disastrous and cruel government” in Brazilian history. Randolfe Rodrigues, a progressive senator who is part of Lula’s campaign team and tipped as a future minister, vowed to work tirelessly to build a multi-party alliance against Bolsonaro, a former paratrooper who openly celebrates the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985. “Today was a starting point. Now we need to bring together all democrats,” Rodrigues said, claiming Bolsonaro’s relentless threats against Brazil’s young democracy meant the coming vote represented an extraodinary crossroads, for Brazil and the world. “2022 isn’t an election like all of those which Brazil has held since the return of democracy. In none of the previous elections … was Brazilian democracy at stake,” Rodrigues said. “In 2022, it is.” As Lula supporters streamed out of the auditorium and a giant Brazil flag – another national symbol leftwingers are trying to wrestle back from the right – was removed from the stage, Rodrigues urged his country to seek inspiration from France, where rival politicians recently pulled together to defeat the far-right Marine Le Pen. “Macron’s victory was a balm for us Brazilians – the French gave us a great example that we must follow here in terms of tolerance and unity,” he said. Rodrigues said the world was “living through a species of fascist international, represented by Trump in the United States, [Viktor] Orbán in Hungary and [Vladimir] Putin in Russia”. Defeating that movement’s South American representative had global significance. “This is a civilising mission,” he said.",News/World news,‘He’s the only way’: how Lula allies hope he will end Bolsonaro era,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/08/how-lula-allies-hope-he-will-end-bolsonaro-era
5/9/2022,"Sixty people are feared to have been killed after a village school in eastern Ukraine took a direct hit in a Russian air raid, with rescue attempts said by the regional governor to be impossible due to constant shelling. Russian attacks in the east and south intensified at the weekend ahead of Monday’s symbolic Victory Day celebrations, with the Black Sea city of Odesa coming under repeated missile strikes and the remaining Ukrainian fighters in the Azovstal steelworks in the besieged port city of Mariupol staging a press conference on Sunday saying they had been “abandoned” by the government as Russian attacks continued About 90 people had been using the school in Bilohorivka, a village 60 miles (97km) north-west of the Russian-controlled city of Luhansk, as a shelter after the previous place of refuge, a club house, had been destroyed in an earlier attack. Serhiy Gaidai, the Luhansk governor, told the Guardian he believed the 30 people who escaped had been outside in the grounds of the building. He said he had little hope for those who were under rubble. “Unfortunately, they are probably dead,” he said. “Because the building collapsed. Besides, an air bomb is not a missile, its explosion produces extremely high temperatures. That’s why most likely people haven’t survived.” Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has stated he intends to take the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions by 9 May when Russia marks Victory Day and the defeat of Nazi Germany. In an address to mark Ukraine’s 8 May remembrance and reconciliation day, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said his country paid homage to all those who helped defeat Adolf Hitler but accused Russia of repeating his crimes. He said: “Every year on 8 May, together with the entire civilised world, we honour everyone who defended the planet from Nazism during world war two. Millions of lost lives, crippled destinies, tortured souls and millions of reasons to say to evil: never again! “We knew the price our ancestors paid for this wisdom. We knew how important it is to preserve it and pass it on to posterity. But we had no idea that our generation would witness the desecration of the words, which, as it turned out, are not the truth for everyone. “This year we say ‘Never again’ differently. We hear ‘Never again’ differently. It sounds painful, cruel. Without an exclamation, but with a question mark. You say: never again? Tell Ukraine about it.” Zelenskiy went on: “On 24 February, the word ‘never’ was erased. Shot and bombed. By hundreds of missiles at 4am, which woke up the entire Ukraine. We heard terrible explosions. We heard: again!” Illya Samoilenko, a lieutenant in the Azov regiment in Mariupol, said his fellow soldiers would be executed if captured by the Russians and that surrender would be a “gift” to the enemy. “We are witnesses of Russian crimes,” he said. “Surrender is not an option because Russia is not interested in our lives.” Gaidai said the attack on the school in Bilohorivka had taken place at 6pm on Saturday night and had been followed by a constant barrage in the surrounding area which had made rescue attempts impossible. He said a bus had been sent to the village, which has a population of 800 to 900 people, to evacuate the remaining residents on Sunday morning but it had to turn round due to the ferocity of the shelling on the roads. Gaidai said: “Right now they are asking us, begging us to get them out, but we can’t. Because everything is now under shelling. Around 70 people wanted to be evacuated today. We sent a bus, but it turned around and went back. Not just the village, but also a highway is under shelling.” Gaidai said he had been frustrated in recent weeks that the residents had repeatedly refused to leave despite the growing dangers to their lives as Russia has focused its attacks in the east and south of Ukraine. Earlier on Saturday, just eight miles (13km) north of the school, two children died, and further two children and an elderly woman were injured when a missile hit the village of Pryvole, Gaidai said. He said: “Around a week ago we tried to evacuate around 300 people from Bilohorivka. We’d already settled this, and sent a few buses. But most of them refused to go. So we managed to evacuate only 60-70 people.” Ukraine’s prosecutor general said that as of 8 May, 225 Ukrainian children had died since Russian launched its invasion on 24 February.",News/World news,Sixty feared dead in Russian airstrike on Ukraine school ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/08/russian-airstrike-ukraine-school
5/9/2022,"The Sun first published a picture of Keir Starmer drinking a beer with Labour workers in a party office in Durham on 30 April 2021 more than a year ago. Until recently, the story was a minor Tory attack jibe, but it is now potentially a resignation matter following Durham police’s decision to reopen its investigation into whether the Labour leader broke Covid lockdown rules. Labour’s line is, and always has been, that after a day campaigning, and an evening working in the office on campaign matters, Starmer had a drink while sharing a takeaway meal with party colleagues and that, although England was in lockdown, indoor gatherings were allowed for “work purposes” and that eating and drinking like this was allowed if “reasonably necessary for work”. Tory MPs and newspapers have claimed that this was in fact a social gathering – more akin to a party – and not work, and they have been aggressively promoting evidence that might reinforce this case. The admission that Angela Rayner was present, when Labour originally said she wasn’t, was cited as proof the party lied about the event. (Labour said it was an honest mistake.) The revelation that the takeaway bill came to £200, in a Sun report claiming up to 30 people were present, was also cited as proof the gathering was larger than originally thought. On Sunday, two new pieces of evidence emerged. The Mail on Sunday published a leaked Labour party planning note showing that Starmer was scheduled to have dinner with Mary Foy, the local Durham MP, in the Labour office where he was working from 8.40pm to 10pm, and that after that he was due to return to his hotel. And the Sunday Times quote an unnamed source present at the event as saying that Starmer did not return to work after his meal, as he has claimed, and that Foy and her staff were present just for a drink, not to work. Both papers say only about 15 people were present – half the number reported by the Sun last week. Not very. Starmer’s critics claim it shows the meal was pre-arranged, and not a spontaneous takeaway order for people getting hungry in the evening, as some of Starmer’s comments on this have implied. And he has been criticised for eating in the office with colleagues, instead of returning to his hotel, which was serving food until 9pm. But the people who plan Starmer’s diary have to know where he is going to eat, and a planning note like this is entirely routine. Labour sources say the document just confirms Starmer was on a work visit, and they point out that the note includes a reference to the Covid alert level and the need for social distancing. They also say the fact that he ate a takeaway in the office, rather than dine at restaurant, just underlines the fact he was working, not socialising. As pictures of the event show, at least some people were eating standing up. According to Labour sources, it was not a sit-down meal; people were going through to the kitchen to collect food, and then going back to work. Starmer “ate between work demands”, the party says. The anonymous person quoted in the Sunday Times also only said Starmer did not return to work “to the best of my knowledge”, Labour point out. As for claims that Foy and her staff were just socialising, not working, the MP says she and her team were working, and that she does not think they broke the rules. This charge has been levelled because Starmer called for Boris Johnson to resign when the Metropolitan police launched their investigation into Partygate. In a tweet on 31 January, he said: “Honesty and decency matter. After months of denials the prime minister is now under criminal investigations for breaking his own lockdown laws. He needs to do the decent thing and resign.” But Labour sources say that tweet was prompted by the fact that Johnson had spent months denying that No 10 parties even took place and that the Met investigation showed that he had been lying. They say this is entirely different, because Starmer has always acknowledged a meal took place. When Johnson was fined over Partygate, Starmer renewed his call for him to resign, saying he had broken the law and lied about it. Labour won’t discuss whether Starmer would also feel obliged to resign if he were found to have broken the law. By any reasonable assessment, not at all. The Conservatives have a clear incentive to imply there is some equivalence – because implying ”all politicians broke the rules” lessens the anti-Johnson outrage generated by Partygate – and the Durham police decision to investigate may have been in part influenced by a desire for the police to seem even-handed when dealing with the Tories and Labour. But, when the Met announced its inquiry into Partygate, it explicitly said it was investigating only those events that seemed to involve “the most serious and flagrant” breach of the rules, and where “there was little ambiguity around the absence of any reasonable defence”. Durham police have not tried to argue that those thresholds have been met in this case. Partygate became a scandal for No 10 because it involved multiple allegations of law breaking at Downing Street. Despite the best efforts of the Tory media, this is the only incident that has come to light in which Starmer has been accused of breaking lockdown rules. Starmer’s meal and beer in Durham is similar to at least one Downing Street event – the wine and cheese event gathering in the No 10 garden on 15 May 2020, which was justified when a photograph of it was published on the grounds that the staff participating were discussing work. Sue Gray looked at this as part of her investigation into Partygate, but this was one of the few events that was not referred to the Met, because the Met concluded there was not enough evidence to show it was against the rules.",News/Politics,What is Beergate and why does it matter?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/08/what-is-beergate-and-why-does-it-matter
