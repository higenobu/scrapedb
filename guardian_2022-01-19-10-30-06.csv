1/19/2022,"A worker at a warehouse supplying Australian supermarkets says managers were not prepared for the Omicron onslaught, resulting in long shifts and stress among workers covering for absent colleagues due to the pandemic. The employee in the supply chain serving Coles, who asked not to be identified due to fear of reprisal, said about a quarter of staff were off work due to Omicron.  He said most of those had Covid-19, rather than being forced to isolate due to being a close contact of a positive case. “A lot of pressure is put on us to try and pick up the slack,” he said, which involved “longer hours and weekends” as well as morning shifts that start earlier. “For instance, we usually start at 6am but a lot of the times … a lot of the staff start at 2am.” High levels of staff absence in supermarket supply chains, coupled with high demand due to panic buying, have emptied shelves of staples including some meats, vegetables and medical supplies including painkillers. Coles’ chief operations officer, Matt Swindells, said Coles did plan in December by recruiting more workers and buying additional stock but the impact of Omicron was “materially greater than the contingency plan anyone could put in place”. “The sheer scale and rate of impact of Omicron, even with all that mitigation in place, has been the single biggest disruption that the industry has seen through all of Covid,” he said. The supermarket group had about 110,000 staff before Christmas and has increased this to about 130,000 in a recruiting program that has included asking former Coles workers to return and streamlining training to speed up getting people on the floor. The secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Sally McManus, said workers across the country were going into the third year of the pandemic “under incredible stress, and are dealing with higher rates of infection and more colleagues being sick than ever before”. “It’s an incredibly difficult and dangerous time in Australian workplaces,” she said. As a result of the crisis, conditions within the warehouse were the most difficult seen so far in the pandemic, the warehouse worker said. “There’s been more tension, I think, more anxiety in people – that I’ve never seen before, including myself. Because so many people around me that had Covid … and then they ring me up the next day and said all, you know, I had Covid, and then I have to worry about my family.” About a month ago health and safety officers warned management “that they will get to be in a position where they need to furlough out a lot of people”, he said. “They said, well we’ll get to that bridge when we get there, and we’re there now. And they’re in the shit.” He said the situation was far worse than during the early days of the pandemic in 2020, when panic buying stripped supermarket shelves of toilet paper and other essentials but warehouses were close to fully staffed. “When we went through the panic buying that was just insane, because we really didn’t need to do it,” he said. Workers in the warehouse wear masks for their entire shift while doing the physically demanding job of picking goods and packing them on to trucks. They are also required to take a rapid antigen test every morning and to re-test if it is positive because RATs are less reliable than the more time-consuming PCR test, which has to be performed by a medical professional. This can result in being tested up to three times a day, the worker said. They were previously required to isolate for a week if a close contact tested positive. However, last week, Scott Morrison said governments had agreed to loosen the rules for essential workers, including those in the food supply chain, in a bid to reduce staff shortages and get goods back on retail shelves. Unions opposed the move, saying it put the health and safety of workers at risk. The Coles supply chain worker said he did not think it would work anyway. “Not in my opinion, no, because of the fact that all the people that I talk to when they give me feedback, they’re all positive.” Swindells confirmed that about 90% of those off work due to Covid had the virus. The warehouse worker said that in addition to staff forced to stay away because they had Covid, several were staying home because they did not want to get vaccinated. “They’re dipping into their long service leave and their entitlements – they can’t access sick leave because they’re not actually sick,” he said. Swindells said the number of people off work because they refused to get vaccinated was only about 2% of the workforce. He agreed that the Omicron wave was the most difficult yet and said it was difficult to know when it would peak. Coles learned to cope with panic buying during the first wave in 2020 and dealt with staff absences concentrated on 12 locked-down local government areas in NSW during last year’s Delta wave, he said. “In Omicron, it’s just an absence of team across the entire supply chain,” he said. “We’ve never had that before. And that’s really what’s probably caused a a bigger problem that’s going to run for longer because the recovery from that requires multiple parts of the supply chain to get things together.” McManus said new health and safety assessments were needed in all workplaces “to ensure that everything that can be done to stop the spread of Omicron is being done”. “Once the federal government can secure a useable supply of rapid antigen tests we will also need these provided free to workers in the vast majority of workplaces,” she said. “These tests are the key to keeping people safe and reducing the burden on our healthcare system.”",News/World news,Employee in Coles supply chain says a quarter of staff on leave due to Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/19/employee-in-coles-supply-chain-says-a-quarter-of-staff-on-leave-due-to-covid
1/19/2022,"A catch-cry made famous by the footballer Cristiano Ronaldo has caused confusion and a degree of annoyance among tennis players and on-lookers alike, with shouts of “siuuu” heard from the stands at this year’s Australian Open. The cheer that sounds like a boo was omnipresent during the opening two days of play at Melbourne Park, leaving some players uncertain about their popularity with the often boisterous Open crowds.  Andy Murray, in an on-court interview following his epic five-set win over Nikoloz Basilashvili on Tuesday, was at one point interrupted by the noise. “Painful stuff … those guys,” the Scot said. He later said: “First I thought they were booing me, but then I realised they were doing the sound Ronaldo does when he scores. It’s incredible.” The cry has been made famous by Manchester United forward Ronaldo, who started using it along with his trademark goal celebration when at Real Madrid. It comes from the Spanish “si” for “yes”, although the five-times Ballon d’Or winner says he doesn’t know why he started to do it, but it just came to him “naturally”. Raucous crowds are not uncommon at Melbourne Park, especially in the evening session and on the usually partisan John Cain Arena, where home favourite Nick Kyrgios opened his campaign on Tuesday night. “Siuuu” was again heard during the Australian’s straight-set win over Liam Broady, although Kyrgios appeared to be more aware of the origins of the shouts than Murray initially appeared. “I wasn’t getting booed. That’s not getting booed,” Kyrgios said. “They actually weren’t saying ‘boo’. “I can’t believe they did it so much. They were doing some Ronaldo thing ... Ronaldo does it every time he scores. I thought they were going to do it for like 10 minutes [but] they did it for two-and-a-half hours, like every point. It was a zoo out there.” Broady, who said he found the overall experience of a night match in front of a partisan crowd on John Cain Arena “absolutely awful”, seemed to think he was booed onto court before the clash. “It’s the first time I’ve ever walked onto a tennis court and been booed, which for me was a crazy experience,” the world No 128 said. “You get sledged from the sides like you can’t believe, [which] they don’t pick up on TV.” ",Sport/Sport,Boo or ‘siuuu’?

1/19/2022,"Aserial prankster has been leaving a trail of novelty oversized googly eyes across metropolitan Adelaide, from fast food and liquor store mascots to one of the city’s most recognisable colonial monuments. The eyes first appeared in the early hours of 11 January, when a pair of suburban Dan Murphy’s and Kentucky Fried Chicken stores on opposite sides of the city were found sporting matching looks of bug-eyed confusion. Management of the Port Road Dan Murphy’s store sighed and shook their head when approached for comment.  While the Eastwood KFC branch swiftly removed the eyes from its big bucket, at Dan Murphy’s the eyes remained fixed to its founder’s face for several days – perhaps in quiet recognition of the prankster’s audacity, or because staff had yet to procure a tall enough ladder. After circulating on various local social media channels, the prank went viral when Twitter user @rAdelaidegrl shared the images to her feed. “I only tweeted it because it made me laugh at the time, thought it might make some of my overseas friends laugh too, and never thought it would gain traction like it has!” she told Guardian Australia. “I do actually live in Adelaide, though, and thought it was a very Adelaide thing to do.” Someone in Adelaide is going around putting giant googly eyes on things and I applaud them. pic.twitter.com/CpmJtU2lZy The big googly eyes, which appear to be readily available online for around $10 a pop, were seen again when a van belonging to a Jim’s Mowing franchisee was spotted with telltale dilated pupils peeking out from beneath the bucket hat. On Monday night, the mysterious artist hit another famous colonel – William Light, the man widely credited with selecting the location of the South Australian capital in 1836 and laying out the city’s streets and parklands. That plan, and the hilltop statue overlooking the city, have come to be known as Light’s Vision. So known is Light among many South Australians that since 2016 Adelaide’s city council has opened its meetings with an acknowledgement of Light’s Vision, sandwiched between an acknowledgement of the Kaurna people, whose country the city was built upon, and the Lord’s Prayer. The monument was also referenced in Paul Kelly’s 1985 song Adelaide (“​​I spilled my wine at the bottom of the statue of Colonel Light”). It’s not the first time the 115-year-old statue has been a target; in June 2020 the messages “no pride in genocide” and “death to Australia” were scrawled in red across the statue’s plinth, part of a wave of colonial monuments around the world that were amended or uprooted by activists in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests. Adelaide’s then-deputy mayor condemned the act and proposed installing CCTV around the statue, a plan that never eventuated. “Colonel Light’s googly eyes have been removed,” Lord Mayor Sandy Verschoor told Guardian Australia on Tuesday. “However, I think we all need a laugh at the moment and the googly eyes appearing around Adelaide have certainly given people a chuckle. “We’ll certainly ‘keep an eye’ on things and, as always, we don’t condone graffiti, offensive messages or property damage.” For South Australians, the googly eyes have provided a welcome respite from rolling headlines about rising Covid-19 case numbers, aged care home outbreaks and widespread ambulance ramping in a state that has remained relatively virus-free for nearly two years. One social media commenter likened Light to Jebediah Springfield, the founder and namesake of The Simpsons’ hometown, whose statue was vandalised by Bart Simpson in an early episode. Another invoked F Scott Fitzgerald, comparing the boggle-eyed visages of Colonel Sanders and Dan Murphy’s to the billboard advertising the work of optometrist Doctor TJ Eckleburg, which looms ominously over the characters in The Great Gatsby. It's very ""Great Gatsby"" pic.twitter.com/qBxcrgS4qY In Fitzgerald’s novel, the billboard is a metaphor for the eyes of God casting judgment over the murky morality of 1920s America. At the time of writing, it is unclear what deeper meaning can be gleaned from the vacant stares of colonels Light and Sanders – but one can’t help but read a new air of accusation in Light’s eternally outstretched arm.",Arts/Art and design,‘A very Adelaide thing to do’: who is behind the city’s googly eyes wave?,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/19/a-very-adelaide-thing-to-do-who-is-behind-the-citys-googly-eyes-wave
1/19/2022,"New Zealand has temporarily cut off the only pathway home for overseas citizens and visa holders, citing the risk of the Omicron variant. Officials announced on Tuesday evening that new spaces in the country’s managed isolation and quarantine system (MIQ) would not be released.  The Covid-19 response minister, Chris Hipkins, said on Wednesday that while the pause was “temporary” there was no date for when spaces would again be available – meaning New Zealand’s border would be closed for an indeterminate time to citizens without an existing booking. “Pausing the next MIQ lobby is a temporary position while MIQ is under extreme pressure from New Zealanders returning with Omicron,” he said. “No decisions have been made on the date, sequence and conditions for the border reopening and cabinet will consider options within the next couple of weeks based on the most up to date advice. Until then, we are not in a position to release more MIQ rooms.” The MIQ head, Chris Bunny, said there had been an “unprecedented number of Omicron cases coming into New Zealand and MIQ”, with a tenfold increase in cases at the border compared with December, and a seven day rolling average of 33. On Wednesday, New Zealand recorded 24 new cases in the community. One of those cases has been confirmed as Omicron, a household contact of an MIQ worker. Separately, an airport worker tested positive on Wednesday. New Zealand’s tough border restrictions have been crucial to its avoiding an Omicron outbreak and keeping Covid cases extremely low – but they are also a source of increasing heartache and rage for those who have found themselves locked out, often in extremely difficult personal circumstances. Other than the risky path of chartering a boat across the Tasman sea, securing a spot in MIQ is the only way into New Zealand. Competition for the rooms, which are released via a lottery system, is fierce. At the last release in early January, a queue of 16,000 people were vying to book one of 1,250 available rooms. For those stranded overseas, the cancellation of future releases was distressing. Maxine Strydom, a member of Grounded Kiwis, which advocates for stranded New Zealanders, said she was stuck in Perth with her two children, and had been unable to secure a spot, despite her job and tenancy in Australia ending. “All of us stranded overseas are affected. We’re all going through mental and emotional stress,” she said. “Soon I’m going to have no money, no house, and no help in a foreign country.” Claire, a New Zealander in San Diego, said: “I feel like every shred of hope has been stripped away … There is no end in sight, it’s just demoralising.” Claire asked to be referred to by first name only amid concerns about criticism by fellow New Zealanders, most of whom have favoured border restrictions. Prof Paula Lorgelly, a health economist based in the UK, had been trying to plan her return home since 2021. She praised the New Zealand government’s overall Covid response, but said at a personal level the cancellations had been difficult. “I’m kind of resigned to waiting,” she said. “[I hope] that it’s a short-term pain for what I perceive to be quite a long-term gain.” The government had previously announced plans to begin a staggered reopening of the border for vaccinated travellers in mid-February. With the emergence of Omicron, however, that plan has been pushed out, and no alternative date announced for when border restrictions may ease. The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said this week it was only a matter of time before an Omicron outbreak cracked through New Zealand’s border – and the country needed to use this window to push vaccination rates as high as possible. About 80% of New Zealand’s total population has had one dose, and 78% are fully vaccinated. Hipkins said New Zealand would use the time that the border stayed closed to increase vaccination. “Our focus will be on getting booster rates up and immunising as many five to 11-year-olds as possible before Omicron takes hold in the community.”",News/World news,New Zealand closes borders to new arrivals over ‘unprecedented’ Omicron risk,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/19/new-zealand-closes-borders-to-new-arrivals-over-unprecedented-omicron-risk
