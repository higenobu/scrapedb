4/15/2022,"When astronauts travel into space they can expect some extraordinary new experiences. But they may also face a more mundane and potentially mission-ending one: kidney stones. According to Nasa, kidney stones have been reported more than 30 times by astronauts upon returning to earth. Now researchers are beginning to unpick why space travel is linked to the painful condition. “The pain you get when you’re passing a kidney stone is the worst pain you can experience,” said Dr Stephen Walsh, clinical senior lecturer in experimental medicine and honorary consultant in nephrology at University College London, who is involved in the research. “There is one cosmonaut who got renal colic [where a stone gets blocked in the urinary tract] in orbit and they almost had to de-orbit him because of his kidney stone.” It is already known that spending time in microgravity is linked to a drop in bone density: this loss of calcium into the blood offers one possible explanation for the buildup of mineral-rich kidney stones in astronauts, with dehydration another potential cause. However the new project aims to dig deeper into these mechanisms. The team are now analysing the kidneys of 10 mice that were on the International Space Station (ISS) in late 2020 before being put down on board, and the kidneys of 20 mice that were exposed to galactic cosmic radiation in laboratories on Earth. They compared these kidneys with those of control mice. While the research has not yet been published, the team say they have early indications that galactic cosmic radiation – which includes gamma radiation as well as high energy particles – may cause damage to DNA in the kidneys as well as affecting the transport and metabolism of fats. The researchers said there were even some signs of changes in proteins around the cells of the kidney, potentially indicating either adaptation or damage of the organs. In addition, mice exposed to the galactic cosmic radiation had lower levels of proteins involved in transporting ions such as those of sodium, calcium and phosphate. The findings also hint at damage to the powerhouses of cells – the mitochondria. That is problematic as a key component of the kidney, the proximal tubular cells, rely entirely on the energy they produce. “When the proximal tubular cells go down, it gives you kidney failure,” said Walsh. “You might make it to Mars, but we recommend dialysis on the way back,” he added. A similar collection of results were found for the mice that had spent time on board the ISS. “For me, that’s surprising,” said Dr Keith Siew, a research fellow and renal specialist at UCL, as he said mice exposed to radiation in the laboratory were given a dose equivalent to a year and a half trip to Mars; those that travelled to space were only on board the ISS for a month. Siew said the team believe it is possible the microgravity environment could be amplifying the impact of the radiation, although further work is needed to explore this. But Siew added the study might not only prove useful for astronauts. “We’re seeing increases year on year of kidney stones occurring on Earth,” he said, adding that improving ways to identify how and why they form, countering their formation or treating them could being benefits. In addition insights into the effects of radiation on astronauts could open up new avenues for preserving healthy tissue in patients on Earth who are undergoing radiotherapy. Prof Ben Turney, a consultant urological surgeon at the Oxford University hospitals NHS trust, who is not involved in the work, welcomed the project. “Currently, considering the prevalence of kidney stone disease, the understanding of how the majority of stones form is surprisingly poor. This [project] will hopefully contribute to the understanding of the processes involved in kidney stone formation,” he said.",News/Science,Space mice may offer clues to why astronauts get kidney stones,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/15/space-mice-may-offer-clues-to-why-astronauts-get-kidney-stones
4/15/2022,"Remember a few months back when Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady retired from the NFL and then unretired? How it was all just weird and awkward, and felt like there was something else going on behind the scenes? Since then, multiple unconfirmed reports have emerged suggesting that this was indeed the case. Honestly, not much. On 1 February, Brady made an announcement that made it clear he was moving on from playing football. On 13 March, Brady promptly unretired, leading many to wonder what exactly had changed in such a short span of time. On 30 March, Tampa Bay head coach Bruce Arians said he would be stepping down in his role and instead would be working in a consulting position. Defensive coordinator Todd Bowles stepped in to replace him. Almost assuredly, given the power dynamics of the situation. Arians was quite replaceable, as head coaches tend to be the league, while Brady is one of the most important figures in the history of the sport. Here’s where we get into the tricky realm of speculation, so everything from here on out needs to be framed with the phrase “reportedly”, especially since it seems unlikely we will get any clarification anytime soon. (Additionally, it could trigger an NFL investigation for tampering if any of these rumors have merit.) Fair enough. On Twitter, Rich Ohrnberger, a former player and current NFL analyst, reported that Brady, along with offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich, felt undermined by Arians and the two were seeking to go elsewhere. Apparently, while Arians was rehabbing the achilles in the early mornings, offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich and Brady would work on the week's game plan. Arians would later come in and take the red pen to work they'd done. The QB and OC felt undermined, there was tension. Meanwhile, Pro Football Talk’s Mark Florio reported during that time that Stephen Ross and the Miami Dolphins wanted to bring in Brady and head coach Sean Payton, but not necessarily in a football role: the point was to have him be part of the head office presumably to start the next phase in Brady’s NFL career. Apparently so. This is where the story starts to sound silly, although it should be noted that ridiculous things are essentially the norm in the NFL. The next step of the plan would have been for Brady to then “unretire”, install himself as the head quarterback and have the Dolphins work out some sort of trade compensation for the loss of himself. There were no rules against Miami signing Brady as an executive, but he would have still been under contract to play quarterback with the Buccaneers if he wanted to be on the field. Yes. This apparently was when the whole plan fell apart. The Dolphins, the team that fired Flores, were going to have to attempt to bring in a white team president and a white head coach while being accused of attempting to circumvent the Rooney Rule, which requires teams to interview a minority candidate for major coaching vacancies. That was simply not going to fly. Well, New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick accidentally sent a text message to Flores that was meant for former Buffalo Bills offensive coordinator Brian Daboll. The message tipped Flores off that the New York Giants had already decided on Daboll before they had even interviewed Flores, suggesting that he was just being interviewed as a formality. If there is any truth behind these reports – and again, we do not know for certain – there is zero chance it would have happened after Flores’s lawsuit. So, yes. I see what you’re getting at here. It would be reckless speculation to suggest that this could have been an elaborate Better Call Saul-type scenario where Bill Belichick “accidentally-on-purpose” texted the wrong Brian because he caught wind of Brady’s plans to join the Dolphins and felt that this would be the way to sabotage them. That does not mean it’s not extremely funny to imagine it as something he would have done, given his history of extremely convoluted schemes. Nothing unless the league decides to investigate the Dolphins for potential tampering, which they probably should at this point. The Dolphins don’t want to dwell on this and the Buccaneers should be just happy to have Brady back. It would be best for them, and the whole continuously scandal-plagued league in general, if this story just went away quickly. Unfortunately for them, in sports, this is the exact kind of juicy conspiracy theory that never really does.

4/15/2022,"There was a knowing grin from David Moyes and a delighted chuckle from Pablo Fornals when the door to the press room swung open and the noise from outside floated through the air. “That’s why I’m in here,” Moyes said, sounding like a weary father apologising for his unruly kids disturbing the other passengers on a packed train. “Everyone is screaming and jumping,” Fornals said as the midfielder listened to the chants of “West Ham are massive” from his jubilant teammates. “The emotions are high. It’s a really lovely moment.” It had been one of those evenings. As Rednex’s Cotton Eye Joe blared around the away dressing room at the Groupama Stadium, Mark Noble sat by his locker and wept tears of joy after West Ham’s stunning 3-0 win over Lyon had taken them into their first European semi-final since 1976. “I don’t know where I am right now,” said Fornals. “The feeling is unbelievable. If we are together we have a big chance against every team.” There had been a similar message from Moyes when the manager addressed his players immediately after their win in the last eight of the Europa League. The Scot reminded his side how far they have come and he could also be forgiven for a moment of personal reflection. This was big for Moyes, who was written off after spells with Manchester United, Real Sociedad and Sunderland. A tactical dinosaur? Moyes had just reached his first European semi-final and, having taken so much flak down the years, it meant a lot that victory over Lyon was achieved with his brother Kenny and his father, David Sr, watching from the stands. Moyes’s family had witnessed something special. West Ham were slight outsiders after drawing the first leg 1-1. They had travelled to France without three key defenders, the absence of Angelo Ogbonna, Kurt Zouma and Aaron Cresswell forcing Moyes to alter his back four, and the concern was that they would not be solid enough to cope with Lyon’s attack. There were troubling questions for Moyes to ponder before the game. Would a centre-back pairing of Craig Dawson and Issa Diop be too much of a drop from Zouma and Ogbonna? Would Vladimir Coufal raise his level at right-back after a difficult campaign? How would the inexperienced Ben Johnson fare in place of the suspended Cresswell at left-back? The early signs were ominous. It was set up for Lyon to attack and they ripped into West Ham at first. Karl Toko Ekambi struck the woodwork. Moussa Dembélé offered slippery movement up front. Diop, who has had a shaky season, picked up an early booking for dragging the striker after losing him on the right flank. “For 25 minutes we couldn’t get hold of the game” Noble said, and in previous years that would have been the cue for a collapse. The pressure would have been too much. Lyon would have broken through and the tie would have been lost. West Ham are different now. They weather storms and force their way into games. They were flaky before bringing Moyes back to the London Stadium two years ago; now they refuse to roll over and always stick together. That resilience was evident when West Ham held firm after losing Cresswell to a controversial red card during the first leg. Every time you doubt them, every time you think it is about to fall apart, they come up with a surprise. They dig deep. They do not worry about their lack of depth, or listen when outsiders talk about fatigue. They keep going and stick together. West Ham defy expectations. When they faced Sevilla in the previous round they battled back after losing the first leg 1-0 in Spain and won the tie in extra-time thanks to an emotional winner from their Ukrainian winger, Andriy Yarmolenko. That triumph was typical of West Ham, who were similarly defiant against Lyon on Thursday night. Dawson, a cheap signing from Watford at the start of last season, stood firm and opened the scoring with a thumping header from a Fornals corner. Diop made interceptions and won his headers. Manuel Lanzini, who has battled to return to his best since suffering a serious knee injury in 2018, offered craft in midfield. Fornals never stopped running and finished the night with two assists. “That is my proudest thing,” Noble said. “This group of players work and run and fight for each other. That is why we are where we are.” West Ham have finally realised that talent alone is not enough. Previous teams were not willing to graft, but Moyes has changed the club’s identity. He can count on Declan Rice to lead by example in midfield. He knows that Jarrod Bowen will track back on the right and that Antonio can occupy an entire defence on his own. Then the quality comes into play. Rice can dominate midfield, while Antonio and Bowen are huge threats on the break. West Ham, who face Eintracht Frankfurt next, have become a proper team and are not in the last four by chance. Glory is within their grasp.",Sport/Football,David Moyes takes West Ham from flaky rollovers to resilient fighters,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/15/david-moyes-takes-west-ham-from-flaky-rollovers-to-resilient-fighters
4/15/2022,"I’m married with two children, aged seven and 12. Maybe it’s the effects of the pandemic…, but both my husband and I feel exhausted and beaten down by life (which sounds very whiny, since we are healthy and OK financially). We have no family close by, though we do have supportive friends. My older child is coping with low mood and depression (and speaking to a counsellor, which is helping), has angry meltdowns and worries about climate change and the war in Ukraine. I share their concerns but try to encourage them not to think about it before bed. I worry whether ours is a happy house. I feel we are in a negative pattern of feeling frustrated by the kids’ behaviour, their fussy eating patterns, and just generally. It feels like at weekends the kids whine, we nag, and there isn’t much joy or fun in our lives. My husband is involved, present, kind and caring, but serious and quiet – so he does not bring a zest for life or a fun side with the kids. This is usually my role, but even if we have those moments, they feel outweighed by the day-to-day bickering and tedium of nagging them to do things. I feel guilty that I am not an example of optimism. Can we change the mood in our house? A word I have returned to repeatedly recently is anhedonia – the inability to take pleasure in things, a lack of joy where joy should be. I think the trauma of the past two years, living with the unknown and the unknowable, being separated from family and friends who provide well-needed perspective, distraction and connection, shouldn’t be underestimated – even before we mix in climate change and war. It’s easy to “go flat” in situations like this as a protective mechanism: when we numb one emotion, we numb them all. You asked how you can change the mood in the house and I think it has to start with you. What makes you happy? What do you need? Moods are infectious, and it sounds like you are the fulcrum in the house, so start attending to your own needs. There’s a real tendency for mothers to put others first and, in so doing, find they have less in the way of reserves. But if you don’t tend to yourself, you can’t care for others. If you feel really long-term down, a trip to the GP may be an idea. Your husband doesn’t have to be about having fun with a capital F: being present with them, engaged, being led by their needs (what are they?), playing quiet games … these are all important. I note you describe yourself as the “adult” of the family, but you’re not, are you? I consulted child and adolescent psychotherapist Louise O’Dwyer. We both wondered what your own childhood was like – this is important because it can inform your expectations. Maybe you feel guilty that your children aren’t having a whiz-bang-pop childhood, but a lot of what you describe is very ordinary, and life is about the ordinary. With regard to the nagging: pick your battles. It really doesn’t matter if certain jobs don’t get done; work out what’s important and let go of what isn’t. This takes practice. Do an age-appropriate rota for reasonable jobs the children can do to help. Children like knowing what’s expected of them, and everyone thrives on achievement. O’Dwyer also recommended sitting and talking, as a family. I can’t second this enough: weekly talks over lunch, or another time when you are calm; maybe doing an activity. Find out how everyone is, what excites and ails them, how their week went, what worked, what didn’t. Be curious. O’Dwyer said that if your child often asks big questions at bedtime, that’s something to take note of. “Is that the only time you have to chat?” she asks. If so, it could be their way of trying to carve out some time with you, so maybe think about when else you could make time for them. You could, she suggests, “acknowledge that that’s a really big question and one we might need to think about, and explore why that might be on their mind right now”. There are some good resources online about how to talk to your children about war, and finding positives in the climate crisis, that you might want to read. Remember to acknowledge your children’s feelings, whatever they are. That really is the most important thing. Children often hand us difficult information for us to digest and give back to them in a more palatable form.  Every week Annalisa Barbieri addresses a family-related problem sent in by a reader.

4/15/2022,"Having survived a couple of years without catching Covid, I had smugly concluded I must be immune until I finally succumbed. To start with it wasn’t too bad – no worse than a heavy cold – when I suddenly realised it was affecting my tastebuds. White wines were just about OK – as with food, fresh citrussy flavours poked through – but reds, especially oak-aged reds, tasted oddly tarry or bitter. And more subtle ones like Italian reds just didn’t seem to register at all. With any luck you’ll still be able to pick up basic tastes even if you can’t detect complex flavours. Sourness is the way to go if your tastebuds are compromised – so many drinks have a sour or a sharp element. Think a margarita, a mojito or a whisky sour (though a peaty element might be problematic) and the myriad different gin cocktails that include citrus: the White Lady, Tom Collins and Gimlet to name three. Sour beer should work too as I’m finding hoppy IPAs taste particularly bitter at the moment. Kombucha, shrubs and switchels and other cider-vinegar-based drinks should appeal if you don’t fancy alcohol for the time being. Even if you don’t normally like vinegar, your atrophied tastebuds will make it taste less tart. There are some excellent suggestions in Mark Diacono’s new book Ferment from Scratch but if you’re feeling too weary to DIY or FYO (ferment your own) you can buy ready-made versions. The turmeric and honey apple cider vinegar shots from cider vinegar specialist Willy’s, whose kombucha I also recommend below, should not only penetrate the fog but are good for you too. There’s obviously little point in spending a great deal of money on wine at the moment or possibly even drinking what you normally drink. I was surprised to find that the very soft sort of jammy red I’m not normally too keen on tasted more like a beaujolais (which I like). My sympathies lie with those who have lived with this debilitating condition for months rather than days. Bear in mind the recommendations below worked for me but may not do it for for you at the stage you’re at with this virus, so keep tasting and trying different options. (A smell-training kit helps, according to fellow sufferers who are further down the line than me.) And do share your own experiences below. Cambalala South African Sauvignon Blanc 2021, 12.5%, £4.95 Aldi. Fresh, clean, citrussy sauvignon at a price which won’t hurt if you still can’t taste too well. Good for the bank holiday too Andrew Peace Shiraz 2020, 13.5%, £5.50 Co-op. Much sweeter and jammier than the reds I normally like but the fruitiness and lack of tannin made this work for me right now. Worth chilling lightly Sipsmith lemon drizzle gin, £28.50, Morrisons, Waitrose, Tesco (£22.50 if you’re a clubcard member). Since gin and lemon both seem to work on the jaded palate combining the two seems like a major win Willy’s sparkling apple Kombucha and ACV, on offer at £1.70 in Ocado, £23.40 for 12 from willysacv.com.

4/15/2022,"Boris Johnson has suffered undeniable political harm in becoming the first serving prime minister fined for breaking the law, and things could get worse if he is punished for other lockdown-breaking parties. But, at least so far, there is little appetite for ousting him. Tory MPs cite the Ukraine war, and perhaps more critically the lack of a credible alternative. Here are Johnson’s potential rivals – and why Conservatives fear they do not measure up. It has not been the best few weeks for the man previously assumed to be the heir in waiting. Firstly his spring statement received a tepid welcome, then last week it emerged that his wife, Akshata Murty, could have avoided about £20m in UK tax by claiming non-domiciled status – she will now pay UK taxes on overseas income – and that Sunak himself held a US green card for six years as an MP, and for 19 months as chancellor. If that was not enough, Sunak was also fined for attending Johnson’s birthday party in June 2020. A number of Tory MPs already held private doubts about Sunak’s political instincts, and their worries have seemingly been confirmed. The foreign secretary, who also holds David Frost’s former Brexit brief, remains avowedly popular with Tory members, the electorate who would ultimately choose who should replace Johnson. Truss was a fixture at the top of the ConservativeHome website’s much-scrutinised cabinet league table based on members’ views, and even now remains in the top five, with a net approval rate of plus 61%. But to reach the final vote, she first needs the backing of enough fellow Conservative MPs – and a number of them have doubts about Truss’s ability to keep them in parliament, a worry backed up by polling. She also attracted criticism when she said she would back Britons going to Ukraine to join the fight against the Russians, with colleagues saying this would be reckless and illegal. Being a militantly free market, pro-Brexit (albeit on a born-again basis), culture war-friendly, tank-borrowing Instagram fixture might tickle the preferences of the Tory faithful. But is that enough to lead the country? Replacing Truss at the peak of the ConservativeHome charts, with a whopping plus 85% approval rating, is the defence secretary, who has achieved renown through the distinctly old-fashioned route of being seen to do his job quietly and effectively. A relatively late entrant to the cabinet – he became an MP in 2005 and only came to the top table in 2019, in his current job – Wallace’s profile rose through his role in the withdrawal from Kabul, and the contrast between his sober style and the desk-dodging beach antics of the then foreign secretary, Dominic Raab. The Ukraine war has led to Wallace’s position rising still further, though he was recently duped into speaking by phone to an impostor – believed to have been a Russian state actor – posing as the Ukrainian prime minister. He is, however, relatively little known outside political circles, while his remain-backing background could count against him among Tory members. The education secretary comes second to Wallace in the Tory member rankings, and enjoys a reputation for unfussy competence, one created in his year as Covid vaccines minister, itself a happy reminder for Conservative MPs of a time where voters believed the government was getting something right and rewarded them in opinion polling. Zahawi also has that most precious of political commodities: a resonant backstory, having moved to the UK aged nine with his Iraqi-Kurdish parents, arriving with no English at all. Potentially counting against Zahawi is his relative inexperience, with only six months in cabinet and four as a minister. Another issue could be whether, after the experience of Sunak, Tory MPs want to consider someone else with extensive business interests and great personal wealth, in Zahawi’s case including a reported £100m property portfolio. Hunt has played a canny game since Johnson took over, managing to remain a significant figure in parliament while also not being in government and having to sign up to the PM’s doctrine. In chairing the health committee and co-leading its Covid inquiry, and popping up in repeated Commons debates, Hunt has been a critical loyalist, and is – the assumption goes – positioning himself as a competent, less controversial alternative should Johnson fall. The issue for Hunt is that too many fellow Tory MPs, particularly the more gung-ho 2019 intake, may see him as an over-liberal throwback to the dim days of Theresa May’s tenure, while the party’s members have already soundly rejected him once when they chose Johnson instead. The mixed fortunes of so many mainstream would-be successors to Johnson has led pundits to cast their prediction net more widely, with Tugendhat mentioned frequently as a possible outside chance. In the Tonbridge MP’s favour, he would certainly be a change from Johnson – who Tugendhat very clearly dislikes – with his long pre-parliament army service and straightforward reputation. But it would be a big political ask. In the Commons since 2015, Tugendhat has never held any frontbench role, his highest office being chair of the foreign affairs committee. Also, for all his hawkish stances on foreign affairs, for example with China, Tugendhat is viewed by many colleagues as a centrist, perhaps not the most popular stance within the party.",News/Politics,Tories’ pretender problem: who next if Boris Johnson falls?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/15/tories-pretender-problem-who-next-if-boris-johnson-falls
4/15/2022,"On Wednesday, police finally arrested Frank James, the man accused of shooting up a crowded subway train in New York City, wounding 10. James, strangely, had called in the tip himself, telling police he was at a Manhattan McDonald’s. Other New Yorkers spotted the subway shooter too, assisting the police. Eric Adams, the New York City mayor, touted the arrest as another victory for the New York police department and called, once more, for increased surveillance on the subways. “We believe we have a technology that we can use in the subway system that many passengers are not even going to be aware that they are walking past a device that could detect weapons, and we are excited about the possibilities and I’m not going to leave any legal technology off the table when it comes down to keeping New Yorkers safe,” Adams said on MSNBC. A former police captain, Adams was elected mayor last year on a promise to crack down on crime. He was able to outflank more liberal rivals in the Democratic primary as public safety became a top issue for voters. Since taking office, he has visited numerous crime scenes and vowed, at various points, to reintroduce tougher policing practices. Progressives are wrong to simply mock police for taking 30 hours to apprehend James or relying on tips to find him – that’s how policing usually works. Some online commentators have argued that the shooting proves police can’t prevent any crime because Adams had already dispatched more cops to the subways and James was still able to detonate a smoke bomb and unload his gun on passengers. Police can deter crime and most working-class New Yorkers want them to catch criminals and solve crimes. But Adams and his tough-on-crime cohort get the story wrong too. Heavy-handed tactics and a new surveillance regime aren’t the answer – because both already exist. Since 9/11, the NYPD has morphed into a standing army with extremely sophisticated weaponry, performing all kinds of counter-terrorism functions. Civil liberties have been abused. If the NYPD can’t police with the tools already at its disposal – including an operating budget of $6bn and a force that numbers approximately 36,000 – then there are greater problems at play. The danger comes when Adams floats new means for surveilling New Yorkers. At first, he seemed to suggest in an interview that metal detectors should be placed in subway stations, an unworkable solution that would probably chase many riders away. Millions enter the city’s subway system daily and there are almost 500 stations. Later, Adams said he didn’t really mean he wanted metal detectors. Instead, he called for newer, if non-specified, technologies. There are theoretical options. The much smaller Los Angeles subway tried out scanners to detect guns and the system malfunctioned during a demonstration. Camden Yards, the home to the Baltimore Orioles, is also attempting a walk-through threat detection portal. The state-run Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which controls the New York City subway system, said no technology would be endorsed that impeded how people moved through the subway. Adams, though, has a thirst for invasive surveillance technologies. He is a proud supporter of the sort of facial recognition tools that can wrongly pin crimes on people of color and exist with little oversight nationally. Since Adams’s crusade against crime is popular with New Yorkers, he will have a wide berth to sacrifice civil liberties in the mistaken belief that such a tradeoff is required to make people safe. It’s not, and never has been. Better investment in mental health services, housing, and social safety net programs can, in the long run, reduce violence in the streets. James is 62, but most violent crime is committed by those under 30 with few other options in life. Gangs have purchase in neighborhoods where jobs and educational opportunities are lacking. And beyond shootings like these, there are crises that mental health professionals, rather than armed police, should be called upon to address. Progressives – especially those who want to defund the police – must recognize that a total pullback from policing won’t succeed either. Those most affected by gun violence want the criminal justice system to function for them. This means having police present who take their trauma seriously, try to crack down on gun trafficking, and help put murderers in prison. Better policing is not the total absence of policing. A good mayor would deploy police effectively without abusing the rights of the most vulnerable New Yorkers. Unfortunately, it’s not clear that Adams is up to that task.

4/15/2022,"The 2022 midterm elections are shaping up to be among the most deeply gender-divided elections in American history. A new poll by NBC News, measuring voters’ preferences ahead of the November elections, shows that the gap in women and men’s voting patterns has deepened considerably over the past 12 years, with Republicans holding an 18-point advantage among men, and Democrats holding a 15-point advantage among women. That 33-point gender gap is up from a 16-point divide in the 2010 midterms. Despite the large degree of analytical attention that has focused on the voting habits of suburban white women, it seems that it’s men who are changing their voting habits most dramatically. The NBC News polling shows that men with college degrees have moved dramatically to the right, lurching towards Republicans by 26 points since just 2018. Men on the whole have moved towards Republicans by 20 points. The Republican party’s exploding support among men comes as the organs of rightwing media and many Republican politicians have embraced a vitriolic language of gender grievance. For months now, the conservative media has been hammering a message of gender and sexual disorder, seeking to stoke the fears, bigotry and resentment of its audience against the social and legal gains that have been made by women and LGBT groups over the past decades. This message has been enthusiastically taken up by Republican politicians, and issues of sexual anxiety have come to preoccupy every level of American government, from local school board meetings to the recent confirmation hearings of a new supreme court justice. It is hard to define the exact moment when men’s gender grievance came to preoccupy the Republican party. With Republicans’ long commitment to anti-choice and anti-trans bills over the past few years, the issue has had longstanding resonance among the base. But a shift seemed to occur last September, when Pete Buttigieg, the secretary of transportation, announced that he would be taking parental leave after he and his husband adopted a pair of newborn twins. Tucker Carlson, the Fox News broadcaster who serves as a weathervane for so much conservative grievance politics, attacked Buttigieg on his show. “Paternity leave, they call it. Trying to figure out how to breastfeed. No word on how that went.” Carlson’s comments were layered with bigotry – against gay men, against mothers, against trans people. But the message was clear: caring for children was feminine and unbecoming of someone who aspired to the masculine authority of a cabinet position. Buttigieg had failed the conservative gender test not once, but twice: first, he was too feminine by virtue of being a gay man. Then, he was too feminine by virtue of being an involved, caregiving parent. The dig was homophobic but also sexist: the only way Carlson could say that Buttigieg was too womanly for power is if women aren’t appropriate holders of power in the first place. Carlson’s attack marked a return to open, avowed homophobic hatred on the Republican right, a stance that had gone dramatically out of fashion, and implicitly out of social acceptability, since the supreme court’s 2015 decision in Obergefell v Hodges, the case that recognized the right of same-sex couples to marry nationwide. Republicans had made a strategic retreat from open homophobia, reasoning that the cultural and generational tides were turning toward acceptance of gay couples. With the success of Carlson’s attack – the homophobic mockery of Buttigieg was enthusiastically embraced by Carlson’s viewers – it seems the tide had turned again. In the months since, homophobia has been unleashed as a reliable way for rightwing figures to rally their base. Gay bashing is back. Merging with the elaborate fictions of the QAnon conspiracy theory, which claims that the United States is run by a group of elite, secretive and possibly cannibalistic pedophiles, the renewed homophobic enthusiasm on the right has now manifested in a mass hysteria over so-called “groomers”. This all-purpose smear is now applied to any liberal (or insufficiently conservative) adult, from politicians to school principals, and alleges that any tolerance for gay rights, or indeed any belief in gender equality, is evidence of a pedophilic interest in children. The alarm over so-called “groomers” has led to restrictive, homophobic interventions in public schooling, from a slew of new book bans around the country, to Florida’s “don’t say gay” bill banning classroom discussion of homosexuality, to a Texas school district’s firing of an out lesbian teacher and banning of a high school Gay-Straight Alliance club. That there is no evidence for this hateful lie that liberals are pedophiles has not stopped ordinary conservatives from embracing it. In Connecticut, a rightwing online group posted the name and home address of a public school superintendent whom they labeled a “groomer” due to the alleged presence of a transgender student in one of the schools she oversaw. The forum called for the school official’s execution. Nor is there any level of ambition or pretended dignity that seems able to deter elected Republicans from indulging in the smear. At the recent supreme court confirmation hearings of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, Republican senators Josh Hawley, Lindsey Graham, Tom Cotton and Ted Cruz all pressed Jackson on her sentencing history as a federal judge, suggesting she was soft on men convicted of possessing child abuse images. All four of the men are believed to have presidential ambitions. Apparently, they feel that stoking the sexual and gender anxieties of the American electorate is a smart move for their careers. The Republican party’s emphasis on gender grievance, and its attendant surge in male support, comes on the eve of the biggest setback for gender equality in half a century: the probable end of Roe v Wade. The supreme court is almost universally expected to overturn the abortion rights precedent this summer; many states, considering the decision already effectively nullified, have rushed to outlaw and criminalize abortion within their borders even before the verdict comes down. The bans that are swiftly moving through Republican-controlled state legislatures typically carry no exemption for rape and incest, and their cruelty is justified in viciously misogynistic terms. When Democrats in the Florida state senate tried to add an exception for rape victims to the 15-week ban that Governor Ron DeSantis signed into law on Thursday, their Republican colleagues shut them down. “I fear for the men who are going to be accused of a rape so that the woman could have an abortion,” Kelli Stargel, one of the bill’s sponsors, argued during floor debate. “A woman is going to say she was raped so she could have the abortion.” Her remark was a lie grounded in misogynist myths and, like the “groomer” smear, has no basis in reality. But it seems that Republicans, and their growing base of male voters, are ready to believe it.

4/15/2022,"In early March, when the British post-punk band Dry Cleaning played the O2 Forum in London, ticketing company Dice informed fans that, counter to usual practice, no merchandise would be sold at the venue. Instead, a pop-up merchandise store would be operating at the Abbey Tavern, a nine-minute walk away. With live music returning after almost two years of shutdown due to the pandemic, artists have never felt the pinch more. Often, merchandise is one of the few ways they can turn a profit on a show. But with Academy Music Group (AMG) venues such as the Forum taking a 25% cut from merch sales, their profit margins are being squeezed ever tighter. “A 25% commission rate is quite a hit to take on merch sales, and it doesn’t feel justified or transparent where that money is going,” says Helena Watmuff from Candy Artists, which manages Dry Cleaning. “Unfortunately it wasn’t an option to lower this, so we let them know that we would be looking at alternatives to selling at the venue.” This proved to be a deft move. “We probably sold the same number of units, but as we were able to retain 25% it worked out better for us financially,” says Watmuff. A Guardian investigation has learned Universal Music Group (UMG) – the largest of the world’s three major record labels – is also taking a share of AMG’s profits from the sales of merchandise. AMG runs multiple venues in cities around the UK such as Birmingham, Bristol, Glasgow, Leeds, Leicester and Manchester as well as the O2 Forum Kentish Town, O2 Academy Brixton and the O2 Shepherd’s Bush Empire in London. UMG confirmed that the merchandise stands at some or all of these venues – it would not specify how many – are outsourced to a longstanding company called Concessions Management International Ltd (CMI) which sits within Bravado, the merchandise division of UMG. When an artist sells merchandise at these venues, 25% of the gross revenues go to AMG and UMG, even if the artist in question is not signed to UMG. UMG told the Guardian that AMG takes “the lion’s share” of revenues. A spokesperson for the label would not comment further. AMG declined multiple opportunities to comment. Campaigns such as #BrokenRecord have argued that musicians and songwriters are losing out in the modern streaming business. For many years, it was presumed that live performing was where acts could make a living even if their streaming revenue was slight. Venues taking a cut of acts’ merchandise sales has been a longstanding problem behind the scenes – with artists and their managers fearful of criticising an influential UK venue operator – that has finally has gone public in recent months. After Charlatans frontman Tim Burgess tweeted in December about the perceived inequities of venues taking a quarter of merchandise sales, the Featured Artists Coalition (FAC) – the UK trade body representing the rights and interests of musicians – set up a public Google Doc titled “100% Venues” listing venues that waive commission. Many of those named on the database are grassroots venues with a capacity of 100-200 people, but it also includes venues with a capacity in excess of 1,000 – such as the Pavilion in Colwyn Bay, the Boiler Shop in Newcastle and the Barbican and the Troxy in London. “It is quite simple from our side,” says David Martin, FAC chief executive officer. “We’ve always been against punitive commission fees being charged for artists to sell their merchandise.” Acts are now taking direct action and pulling merchandise from shows at venues that take a cut. British musician Aluna Francis, formerly of AlunaGeorge, says the delicate economics of live music rarely add up, which led her to stop selling merchandise on tour. “A venue has its own turnover of physical goods that will bring cash in,” she says. “You’ve got the alcohol and the door. That’s measurable and reliable. It feels like creaming off the top of the money generated from merch because you’re holding the artist to ransom.” Those in the live music business accept that venues also struggled in the pandemic but feel that a significant lowering of the concession rate would be the optimum, or even an interim, solution. Some venues have used the problem as an opportunity to poach acts from rivals: the agent for one major international act recently booked them into an outdoor stadium, rather than a competitor venue, because it offered zero commission on merchandise sales. But many are unwilling to negotiate. Martin said that assorted venues had stonewalled FAC letters asking to discuss the problem as a matter of urgency. “We’ve had at least one response which said, ‘You don’t know how venues work at this size,’” he says. “I would level the same argument to those venues: you don’t know the cost of putting on a show in your large venue for an artist.” One major agent echoed Martin’s experience, saying that any attempts to raise it with venues are immediately shut down. They suggest that venues lowering their cut, rather than removing it completely, could be acceptable, as could a one-off fee per show. They described the attitude of such venues as: “‘If you don’t want to sell your merch, then don’t sell your merch.’ That feels like cutting off your nose to spite your face as 10% of something and merch at a reasonable rate is better than 0% of nothing.”",Arts/Music,‘Holding the artist to ransom’: musicians struggle to break even as venues and Universal cream off merch sales,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/15/holding-the-artist-to-ransom-musicians-struggle-to-break-even-as-venues-and-universal-cream-off-merch-sales
4/15/2022,"In the late 18th century Britain’s Caribbean island colony of Grenada was a place of boom and bust. A hurricane, a plague of ants, and Britain’s wars against France and American revolutionaries made for volatile trade in its main commodities – sugar, coffee, and slaves. Amid the turmoil, property changed hands regularly among Britain’s financial elite, but in the early 1770s the ownership of two plantations and 599 people passed to an unusual new owner: the Bank of England. The Bank has already apologised for its role in the slave trade, but revelations of the institution’s direct ownership of the people have been uncovered in new research commissioned in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020. The research has been presented in a new exhibition that opened this week at the Bank’s museum in its headquarters on London’s Threadneedle Street. The names of the 599 slaves, acquired by the Bank in the 1770s, take a central position in the free exhibition. During the protests the Bank apologised for the 25 governors and directors who had owned slaves. It removed eight paintings and two busts of the slave owners from public display, although the exhibition includes some reproductions. It has been part of a reassessment of historical links to slavery and imperialism by institutions ranging from many of the UK’s big high street banks – Barclays, HSBC, NatWest Group and Lloyds Banking Group – to the insurance market Lloyd’s of London and the brewer Greene King, as well as the National Trust and English Heritage, the custodians of British country houses that were in many cases built using colonial or slave wealth. Despite the key role that slavery played in the British imperial economy, that reassessment has become a sensitive subject. The National Trust in particular has faced a barrage of criticism from parts of the Conservative party and campaigners who complained that acknowledging links to slavery and colonialism would “give country house visits a political and racial dimension”. The Bank of England was itself criticised this month for supposedly “woke” policies after it changed the flag depicted on its logo from the English flag of St George to the Union flag, to better reflect the central bank’s role serving the whole of the United Kingdom. A Bank of England spokesperson said: “In 2021, the Bank of England commissioned a researcher to explore its historic links to transatlantic slavery, working with the Bank of England museum and archive. “This research found that in the 1770s the Bank made loans to a merchant company called Alexander & Sons. When the business defaulted on those loans, the Bank came into possession of two plantations in Grenada which had been pledged as security for the loans. Our research has found that 599 enslaved African people lived and worked on those plantations. The Bank subsequently sold on the plantations.” The research was led by Michael Bennett, a specialist in the history of early modern Britain and Caribbean slavery, and followed work by a small group of volunteers from across the Bank, including members of its ethnic minorities network. Michael Taylor, a historian whose 2020 book The Interest showed how the British establishment resisted abolition, said it would be difficult to find any UK financial institution of a comparable age that was not involved in some way with the slave trade. “For the century before the abolition of the slave trade in 1807-8, Britain was the world’s leading slave power,” he said. “Moreover, slave-grown sugar, coffee, and cotton were among the most valuable commodities in global markets. Together, these factors meant that the slave economy was absolutely vital to Britain’s wider prosperity. “Owning and running slave plantations was a capital-intensive enterprise: planters needed to buy slaves, import machinery and build boiling houses, all of which took massive up-front investment and extensions of credit. Plantations were then mortgaged and remortgaged, and in these ways British banking was connected intimately to slavery.” Accounts for the plantations show spending on hospitalisations of slaves, the recapture of runaways and “cage fees”, as well as payments to the Bank of England. The plantations, called Bacolet and Chemin, were eventually sold in 1790 to an MP for the equivalent of £15m in today’s money. The plantations were held under nine of Andrew Bailey’s predecessors as the Bank’s current governor. A 1788 inventory of Bacolet, reproduced in the exhibition, shows property under several headings: “land”, “slaves”, “buildings” and “stock”. Most of the men, women and children listed have European names such as Pierre, Alexandre, Catherine and Marie, with no information on which country they were taken from. Beside each name is a sterling price for how much the person was worth to her or his owners, ranging from £330 for Pierre, a “field man” labelled as a “driver”, to £30 for Michell, who is described in a bracketed note as “sickley”.",News/World news,"Bank of England owned 599 slaves in 1770s, new exhibition reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/15/bank-of-england-owned-599-slaves-in-1770s-new-exhibition-reveals
4/15/2022,"At least a dozen climate protesters have been arrested after defying an injunction to launch synchronised actions targeting three key fuel distribution terminals early on Friday. Seven supporters of the Just Stop Oil campaign trespassed at the Kingsbury oil terminal near Tamworth, Staffordshire, despite an injunction banning them from protesting at or around the site. According to a statement by the group, the trespassers at Kingsbury paralysed its operations by occupying its loading bay, climbing on to loading bay pipework and locking on. Others took action in Essex, staging road blocks and climbing on to fuel tankers on major tanker routes from the Inter terminal in Grays and the Navigator terminal in West Thurrock, which are on the banks of the Thames and supply petrol stations in east London and across the south-east. Warwickshire police said 12 arrests had been made on Friday morning, while officers were also at the scene in Essex, according to the PA Media news agency. Warwickshire police said: “Officers remain at Kingsbury oil terminal today and are currently dealing with protest activity after a number of protesters arrived overnight. There is minimal impact to the wider community at this time.” The action at Kingsbury comes after the terminal’s owner, Texas-headquartered Valero Energy, this week obtained an injunction banning protests at any of its UK operations. The injunction, which is addressed to a number of environmental groups and “persons unknown”, bans anyone from damaging any part of the land at each of the firm’s sites, from “affixing themselves to any other person or object” on the land or parts of access roads, and from building any structure. Activists from Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion have taken action at 11 oil terminals since 1 April, and say they will continue targeting fuel distribution infrastructure until the government agrees to a moratorium on all new fossil fuel projects. Activists taking part in the campaign have been arrested 965 times so far, according to a tally kept by coordinators. Among those taking action on Friday was Alex, 16, from south London. He said: “I’m taking action because I’m terrified of the future for my friends and family. “If we do not act with urgency to end our reliance on fossil fuels, climate collapse will be inevitable, and that means we will lose everything. All our certainties, everything we rely on will go. We will be lucky to have enough food to eat. “Oil will destroy everything.”",News/Environment,Defiant Just Stop Oil protesters arrested in Staffordshire and Essex ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/15/just-stop-oil-protesters-arrested-staffordshire-essex
4/15/2022,"Russia’s switch to making debt payments in roubles has brought the heavily sanctioned country to the brink of defaulting on its debts, according to a leading credit rating agency. Heaping further pressure on Vladimir Putin’s beleaguered government, Moody’s said that without a return before 4 May to making payments in dollars as agreed under the terms of Russia’s loans, Moscow could be in default, allowing creditors to claim insurance payouts and tainting the country’s reputation as a reliable counterparty. The warning by Moody’s of an impending default is expected to be met with an angry response from Putin’s administration, which has denied that the rules governing its loans prevent Russia making interest payments in roubles. In response to a similar declaration last week by Standard & Poor’s that payments in roubles jeopardised Russia’s status as a borrower, the Kremlin said the west had already defaulted on its obligations by freezing its reserves, and that it wanted a new system to replace the Bretton Woods financial architecture established by western powers in 1944. Sanctions on Russia since its invasion of Ukraine have prevented the Russian central bank from accessing much of the foreign currency it has amassed in recent years. Earlier this week, Anton Siluanov told the pro-Kremlin Izvestia newspaper that Russia had taken “all the necessary steps” to pay its international creditors. Russia’s minister of finance suggested it could go to court to argue that the terms of its repayments had been met. “Of course we will sue, because we have taken all the necessary steps to ensure that investors receive their payments,” he said. If Moscow is declared in default, it would mark Russia’s first failure to pay interest payments on foreign bonds since the currency crisis of 1998, when investor confidence collapsed and the Boris Yeltsin government was unable to sell new bonds on the international markets to finance old ones. Over the past week, Russia has needed to meet two payment deadlines on bonds it previously sold to foreign investors. The combined interest was worth nearly $650m, and Russia was supposed to have made the payments in dollars, according to the terms of the bond contracts. It is understood that one of Russia’s major lenders has asked the Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee, a division of a trade body that is made up from representatives of private sector lenders, to judge whether a “potential failure to pay” had occurred in relation to Russia’s bonds. Russia still has 18 days left of a 30-day grace period before the committee would be able to rule that a “credit event” – a default – had occurred. Moody’s said: “Russia reportedly made payments on two bonds maturing in 2022 and 2042 in roubles rather than US dollars which represents a change in payment terms relative to the original bond contracts and therefore may be considered a default under Moody’s definition if not cured by 4 May, which is the end of the grace period. “The bond contracts have no provision for repayment in any other currency other than dollars,” it added. In 1998 Russia forced lenders to wait 90 days before it made debt interest payments, triggering a technical default. Desperate to keep imports flowing, but without the foreign currency to pay for them, the Kremlin resorted to a barter system with foreign companies and governments, which some analysts believe is being deployed at the moment as a way to circumvent sanctions rules. The country was bailed out by a rise in the oil price that generated billions of dollars of foreign currency. By the end of 1998 the economy had begun to recover and the government was able to make debt repayments again. Foreign lenders are concerned that a freeze on Russia’s dollar and euro assets under the current sanctions regime means that a similar recovery and a return to making interest payments in foreign currency will prove to be beyond the Kremlin this time. If Russia misses debt deadlines, lenders that have insured their loans using credit default swaps will be able to seek insurance payouts.",News/World news,"Russia near to defaulting on overseas debts, says ratings agency",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/15/russia-near-to-defaulting-on-overseas-debts-says-ratings-agency
4/15/2022,"For years rugby clubs barely considered their wider profile. As long as their captive audience of season ticket holders and local sponsors were happy, everything else was a bonus. Even for prestigious London sides like Harlequins it was less about the scattering of customers at their games than ensuring there was enough ice and lemon for the committee’s gins and tonics. Sometimes we forget the huge difference professionalism has made. These days a packed house will be in full cry at the Stoop for the European last 16 second leg fixture against Montpellier, hoping to see last Sunday’s 14-point deficit thrillingly overturned. After last season’s Premiership final, when Quins were memorably crowned domestic champions, there should hopefully be a sizeable lunchtime TV audience on Channel 4 as well on Saturday. Professional club rugby, though, remains a commercial speck on the horizon behind the Premier League, the NFL and the NBA. There is even a quantum leap to be made before it can hope to compete with the international game. Which is why Quins’ biggest promotional platform this month is arguably not the Montpellier fixture but a revealing three-part documentary series about the club made by the Bath and England prop Beno Obano’s company, Sinnybaby Media. Prep To Win, coming soon to Amazon Prime, is an intriguing project on many levels, not least Quins’ willingness to place their trust in an active player from a rival team. Nor was the club permitted full editorial control which even Obano describes it as a major “leap of faith” by their senior management. “We spoke briefly to a lot of other people and initially I found it quite weird how many blockades there were. But Quins were just so helpful. They were like ‘Yeah, let’s get it done.’ They really wanted it.” Quins’ chief executive, Laurie Dalrymple, confirms it was “a bit of an easy decision” with the club already looking to capitalise on their title success with an inside-the-camp production. Like everyone else Dalrymple has watched Drive to Survive transform perceptions of Formula One and, rugby-wise, is keen for Quins to stay at the front of the grid. It did no harm, either, that Obano is friendly with Marcus Smith, was previously coached by Tabai Matson at Bath and has already cut his directorial teeth by making the well-regarded Everybody’s Game which explored rugby union’s attitudes to social and cultural diversity. The 27-year-old Obano, capped three times by England and a cousin of Maro Itoje, also argues he has an inbuilt advantage over other would-be rugby filmmakers: the ability to deliver a truly authentic end product. “When you’re actually in the game, you’re able to go to topics you know are interesting that another director wouldn’t be privy to.” By doing so, he hopes to open the audience’s eyes to aspects they might not fully appreciate. “You can focus on the people involved, rather than just hoping the viewers will enjoy it.” An unintentional creative plus – “Divine timing is what I call it” – is that Obano has been injured for several months, giving him more time to work on his latest creation. Although he could not snoop around everywhere – “Obviously that’s a huge conflict of interest” – and some tactical details had to be withheld, he had three cameramen shooting footage for him and was on hand for all the keynote interviews. Stitching everything together was a challenge but Obano believes people will swiftly develop a new-found appreciation of unflashy players like James Chisholm – “I couldn’t have made this film without him” – and gain a deeper insight into recognisable stars such as Smith. “When you stick a camera in front of someone’s face, some people are better at being honest than others. But I think we’ve got a good diverse group who were able to speak quite candidly. I’ve know Marcus for a while and been close to him. Marcus is hot right now and he’s a proper nice person. His whole family are in the documentary as well.” There is also a cameo appearance from the ubiquitous David Flatman – “Flats is very good in it – he’s proper funny” – but above all Obano is desperate to demonstrate there is more to rugby than just the international arena. “We cling on, as a country, to England players. People’s perception of whether somebody is good is only defined by who the England coach is at that particular time or who the commentators are on BT Sport. “A lot of rugby players finish their careers and if they haven’t played for England they feel like a failure. That was in my mind. Let’s try and promote these guys, let the fans understand the game a bit more and make a decision for themselves rather than who Ben Kay or Ugo Monye tells them is really good.” Not quite so glamour-soaked as Drive to Survive, perhaps, but Obano deserves substantial credit simply for getting the series in the can and for his ongoing mission to enlarge the sport’s footprint. Quins, coincidentally, have hosted the England football manager Gareth Southgate at their training ground this week and Dalrymple, previously chief executive of Wolverhampton Wanderers, can clearly sniff a commercial half chance. Obano’s view, from the outset, was that the exposure would so obviously benefit Quins and, potentially, the wider game that he “struggled to see the downside.” Of course it would also help all involved if Quins, 34-0 down at one point in France, could now complete a remarkable Easter resurrection but Obano has longer term goals. “It’s not easy making a series. You get days when you wonder if it’s going to be as good as you want it to be. But I created this to make good content around rugby. The sole purpose is not just to create a wider audience. I feel like that’s a by-product of good content. “Rugby fans, players, staff – I hope they all connect with the people they see on screen and understand and admire those stories. Rugby players don’t always come across that well. A lot of them aren’t that cool. They’re just good at sport. But what if we’re able to show some of their personalities? There are so many themes in it but I want people to feel ‘I’m now really connected to this sport.’” Perhaps unsurprisingly, Obano has already had messages from other Premiership sides keen to feature in series two. Club rugby could just be on the brink of a game-changing innovation.",Sport/Sport,New Harlequins documentary could be a gamechanger for club rugby,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/15/new-harlequins-documentary-could-be-a-game-changer-for-club-rugby
