4/28/2022,"It’s hard to see your idols torn down unfairly but it’s also galling when they attempt to tear you down without just cause. I am a Viola Davis fan; many of her performances have been majestic and the critics have often crowded round to say so, as far as I can tell. But some have not been kind about her portrayal of Michelle Obama in The First Lady and now she has said that critics “absolutely serve no purpose”, although her defenders suggest the comment refers to critics on Twitter, not the entire body of criticism. Still it seems astonishingly thin-skinned and part of a current fashion to issue disdain publicly on the apparently grubbiest of Grub Street, though never when the reviews are glowing, of course. I can see why some – particularly artists of colour – feel misjudged by the overwhelmingly narrow demographic of critics out there, but that is a different discussion. If some want to write off criticism as nonsense, that’s their delusion. Perhaps they have not read James Wood, Parul Sehgal, Margo Jefferson, Philip French, AO Scott or Michael Billington, among others, in recent decades. And maybe they have not encountered the rich canon of literary criticism much further back. I am not suggesting that today’s critics are latter-day William Hazlitts but I do believe that criticism is vital to culture, as does Kwame Kwei-Armah, who made the point some years ago that reviews are a legitimate part of the industry’s ecosystem. I have reviewed his shows both positively and negatively since and he has always welcomed me with open arms, unlike some other less sporting responses from similarly seasoned figures after they receive a less than enthusiastic review. The lazy refrain “What are critics for?” is a stone’s throw away from asking: “What is art for?” If storytelling is a vital part of life, so is its analysis – what it says, how well it says it, what it means to us. Critical appraisal enriches stories and builds an existential dialogue between creator and receiver. Peter Brook, in The Empty Space, suggested that critics can feed into the creative process and improve it. At its best, criticism is an art in itself albeit an imperfect one – subjective and dependent on taste and sensibility. At its worst, it can show cruelty and whimsy as well as the unconscious biases we carry. If you love stories – on film, radio, canvas, page or stage – you are likely to be interested in their architecture: how they build their worlds, characters, effects. This is what critics spend their lives looking at as rigorously as they can. Criticism is, in effect, a homage to storytelling. Reading criticism taught me how to make sense of things as a teenager and how to better know my own tastes. I recently talked to the playwright Beth Steel who said that in the days she couldn’t afford to see live theatre, she’d read all the reviews instead and think through ideas that way. Criticism over the last few years has become increasingly lenient, given the pandemic and the desire to support the creative industries in straitened times. Maybe this has inadvertently left some actors and artists less hardened to negative reviews. But it is not our job to sell tickets or books or TV subscriptions. Criticism is already perilously close to the market and we are in danger of eroding its worth if we are not absolutely honest and remember we serve only our readers. Neither is a negative review an entirely negative experience in every instance. I wrote a book, published last year, and some of its more negative reviews online genuinely made me think of how I might have opened up the book to other kinds of readers. It will probably have a beneficial effect on any subsequent book I write. Ultimately, critics are readers and audience members. We are figuring out how something affects us and if we connect with its human experience. To sneer at us, and suggest our responses lack purpose, is to sneer at the audience.

4/28/2022,"Abittersweet love letter to the Edinburgh fringe, performed by a middle-aged Scotsman? I may be the optimum audience member for Jack Docherty’s teasingly autobiographical (or is it?) anti-romcom, but there’s plenty here to engage a wider demographic. After four decades as a sketch comic, chatshow host and most recently star of the sitcom Scot Squad, Docherty is starring here for the first time as “himself”, in a solo show that recounts the fallout from a one-night stand 30 years ago. It conjures compellingly with ageing and regret, lives unlived and the painful difference between the real world and the movies. The stripped-back aesthetics, Docherty’s direct address and the verifiable biographical details all suggest a true story, which begins when the Absolutely star is riding high on his 1980s celebrity at the fringe. He locks eyes with a woman in his crowd; a picture-perfect fling – on Arthur’s Seat, of course – ensues. But Docherty never lingers there for long. Nothing But flits restlessly between 1989 and 2018, when the balding 56-year-old returns to the fringe, trying to recover a little of his youthful glory – and some of the romance, too, with which his experiences of the festival are terminally associated. The cinematic reference point here is Richard Linklater’s Before Sunrise/Sunset, refashioned for a city where, in August, the sun is seldom seen to rise at all. Docherty’s project is to reveal the tragedy of a life spent in hock to romantic fantasies. We want to root for his amorous fulfilment, but he makes us wonder whether we should, portraying himself (or his fictional alter ego?) as a bad husband and dad, jealous of young male comedians while prospecting for sex with their female fans. Vivid word-pictures bring these tawdry misadventures to carnal-comic life. Ideally, you’d be watching Nothing But on the Edinburgh fringe, where it began, and to which – as a site where, for a precious few weeks each year, fantasy eclipses real life and youthful dreams come true – the show pays complicated tribute. But even 400 miles south, its story of Docherty pulling back the curtain at last on his long-cherished parallel life hits home.

4/28/2022,"ESPN anchor Sage Steele is suing the network after claiming it curtailed her right to free speech over remarks she made last year. Steele attracted criticism after remarks she made on a podcast hosted by former NFL quarterback Jay Cutler last September. During her appearance, the SportsCenter host called ESPN’s vaccine mandate “sick”, said female reporters should change the way they dress to avoid inappropriate comments from male athletes and questioned whether Barack Obama is Black. “If they make you choose a race, what are you gonna put? Well, both,” Steele, who is biracial, said at the time. “Barack Obama chose Black, and he’s biracial … congratulations to the President, that’s his thing. I think that’s fascinating considering his Black dad is nowhere to be found but his white mom and grandma raised him, but OK. You do you. I’m gonna do me. Listen, I’m pretty sure my white mom was there when I was born. And my white family loves me as much as my Black family.” Former ESPN journalist Jemele Hill was among those who attacked Steele for the remarks, calling her a “clown”. Steele was given a short suspension from the network and issued an apology at the time. “We are in the midst of an extremely challenging time that impacts all of us, and its more critical than ever that we communicate constructively and thoughtfully,” she wrote. However in the lawsuit, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, the 49-year-old says ESPN reduced her role at the network in retaliation, failed to prevent her being bullied by colleagues and had curtailed her free speech. The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, also accuses ESPN of failing to take Steele’s comments in context. In a statement to the Journal on Wednesday, ESPN pointed to recent prominent roles assigned to Steele. “Sage remains a valued contributor on some of ESPN’s highest profile content, including the recent Masters telecasts and anchoring our noon SportsCenter,” the network said. ESPN has dealt with a number of issues around its staff in recent years. Hill left the network to join the Atlantic in 2018 after she called Donald Trump a “white supremacist” and criticized the Dallas Cowboys for threatening to punish players who knelt for the national anthem.",Sport/Sport,Sage Steele sues ESPN after remarks on vaccine mandate and Obama’s race,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/28/sage-steele-sues-espn-jay-cutler-podcast-barack-obama-vaccine-mandate
4/28/2022,"A man has appeared in court accused of murder as police continue searching for a missing woman from Lancashire. Katie Kenyon, 33, has not been seen since last Friday when she got into a van in her home town of Burnley. Police believe she has been killed and are looking for her body. Andrew Burfield, 50, of Burnley, made a brief appearance at Blackburn magistrates court charged with Kenyon’s murder. Burfield spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth and address during the three-minute hearing. He was remanded into custody until Friday when he will appear at Preston crown court. Kenyon, from Padiham, Burnley, was last seen at about 9.30am last Friday when it is thought she travelled in a Ford Transit van that left the town heading towards the Bolton-by-Bowland area of Lancashire. On Wednesday, police carried out searches in Gisburn Forest, a remote beauty spot in east Lancashire. More than 60 specialist search officers from four police forces scoured the area of dense forest looking for Kenyon. The hunt involved police and fire service officers, dog teams, mounted police, mountain rescue volunteers and drones. Kenyon is described as white, 5ft 9in, with shoulder-length strawberry blonde/ginger hair. She was last seen wearing a blue shirt or jacket and white vest top, black leggings and flip-flops.

4/28/2022,"When Downing Street was recently named as the suspected victim of a phone hack by the United Arab Emirates using the Israeli-made spyware, Pegasus, few were surprised at who was behind the discovery. The Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto has for years been a thorn in the side of the NSO Group, deciphering the company’s sophisticated hacking tools and – crucially – identifying victims of the spyware. Ron Deibert, the longtime director of the Canadian research group, is one of the world’s leading experts on identifying digital threats against civil society. John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab, is among a relatively small group of experts globally who can identify which iPhones and Android devices have been infected with Pegasus, and which government clients are likely to have been responsible. It is unsurprising, then, that the pair were an intense focus at Novalpina, the London-based private equity group which took over NSO Group in 2019, and quickly sought to stem its reputation for enabling repressive governments to commit widespread human rights abuses. Using UK data protection laws, Deibert and Scott-Railton last year sought the personal data held on them by Novalpina. The results of their so-called subject access requests, recently shared with the Guardian, contain snippets of hundreds of emails and attachments that included their names. The released data, combined with information from other sources, sheds light on an apparent attempt by Novalpina partner Stephen Peel to gather information on and undermine Citizen Lab. In one case, he even reached out to George Soros, whose foundation is an important Citizen Lab donor, and complained about the researchers. Peel, a former British Olympic rower, was the architect of a drive to “establish a new benchmark for transparency and respect for human rights” when Novalpina acquired NSO in early 2019. Citizen Lab, meanwhile, had since 2016 been at the forefront of exposing the human rights abuses perpetrated by NSO Group’s customers, revealing, for example, how Saudi Arabia had used the company’s spyware to hack the mobile phone of a dissident who was a close associate of Jamal Khashoggi months before the journalist was murdered. Novalpina’s lawyers said in letters released to Deibert and Scott-Railton that they found 473 emails that contained Deibert’s personal data, which included some duplicates. 223 emails named Scott-Railton. They reveal how in February 2019, Novalpina and NSO retained the services of Vivek Krishnamurthy, who at the time was a lawyer with expertise in corporate social responsibility practice at the American law firm Foley Hoag. A source familiar with the matter said NSO paid the firm about $220,000 (£170,000) for its work. Krishnamurthy was recruited as a “specialist external adviser” to align NSO’s governance framework with the UN’s guiding principles on business and human rights (UNGP). However, the documents suggest there may have been another motive as well: Krishnamurthy was an alumnus of the University of Toronto, and years earlier had worked as a research assistant for Deibert, who had helped him secure a Rhodes scholarship. As a result, he was well-placed to try to cosy up to the NSO critic. A February 2019 proposal by Foley Hoag to provide legal services to NSO said Krishnamurthy’s prior relationship with Deibert meant he was in a “unique position to conduct outreach to Citizen Lab should the NSO Group find it desirable to do so”. The proposal acknowledged that NSO had “reputational challenges” and said: “Our goal is to help the NSO Group become seen as the world’s most ethical company in the surveillance space by establishing systems, policies, and procedures to ensure that it operates in a rights-respecting manner.” In a 1 March 2019 exchange, Peel emailed Krishnamurthy telling the lawyer it was time to “reach out to Deibert to find out what is going on”. The lawyer promptly replied that he would, adding: “He can be prickly, and he’s clearly worked up about NSO.” The following day, Krishnamurthy sent an email to his former mentor, explaining he had been hired to work on NSO’s human rights policies. He told Deibert he had “thought long and hard” about whether to work for NSO, especially in light of Citizen Lab’s recent work. “I would probably have said no were it not for my good friend Sir Mark Stephens,” he wrote, referring to the British lawyer – who is a CBE but not a knight – as “one of the world’s foremost human rights lawyers”. He said Stephens, a celebrated British lawyer who frequently acts in high-profile cases, with former clients including Julian Assange, Salman Rushdie, and Greenpeace, had assured him of Peel’s “deep personal commitment to human rights, and of his desire to see NSO operate in a rights-respecting manner”. Deibert declined the meeting. He told the Guardian he did not believe NSO Group or its owners had shown good faith in responses to Citizen Lab’s correspondence and questions, and did not wish to appear to legitimise the company. He also turned down an attempt three months later by Krishnamurthy to secure a face-to-face meeting with his old university mentor when – following an exchange with Peel informing him he would again seek out a meeting with Deibert – Krishnamurthy told Deibert by email that he wanted to see him while on family trip to Toronto: “You’d be having a drink with me in my capacity as your former student, and not as anything else!” Deibert said he found it “deeply troubling and disappointing” that Novalpina had employed a former student and research assistant seemingly to “surreptitiously weasel their way into gathering information on our activities”. Krishnamurthy, a faculty member at the University of Ottawa who was recently appointed to a Canadian government advisory committee on online safety, denied he was hired for that reason, but conceded that his prior relationship with Deibert was relevant for the work he could do for Novalpina “as a good faith broker” with the NGO community. He expressed “regret” that his work for NSO’s financial backers damaged his relationship with Deibert, describing his work for for the company as “the weirdest matter I’ve ever handled”. Stephens, who described Peel as a friend, confirmed that he suggested Krishnamurthy to the Novalpina executive, but he said he was unaware at the time of Krishnamurthy’s prior relationship with Deibert. He said he had previously worked for Peel, but not for Novalpina or NSO. Stephens praised Peel and criticised Citizen Lab for disproportionately focusing on NSO. “The practical result of what they [Citizen Lab] have done is to ignore and effectively divert attention from the other players in this marketplace and they have given them a completely free pass and I think that’s reprehensible,” Stephens said. Citizen Lab has, in fact, produced reports on a range of other cyber surveillance companies, and published reports on other digital threats to civil society, including Chinese government censorship and vulnerabilities in Covid-related applications. Its work has attracted funding from the Ford Foundation, Hewlett Foundation, and the Open Society Foundations, which was created by the billionaire philanthropist George Soros. The Novalpina documents released to Deibert include one email from Soros’s office that was forwarded by Peel to NSO in Israel. The document was redacted, but well-placed sources and other emails seen by the Guardian suggest the outreach to Soros may have been part of an ultimately unsuccessful attempt by Peel to undermine Citizen Lab’s funding. In May 2019, Peel is understood to have raised Citizen Lab at a dinner with Soros in New York. He later followed up with emails in which he sought to discredit the Canadian research group. In one, he lambasted Citizen Lab’s research, claiming it was “an organisation unknown except for its attack on NSO”. He questioned the group’s motivations, tactics, and objectives, which he described as “a little less pure than we might of hoped”. One person familiar with the matter said they believed Peel’s unspoken aim could have been to get Soros to withhold his charity’s financial support for the researchers. A second well-placed source said they could not judge Peel’s motive, but they could not rule out that was his intention. Soros was ultimately unmoved by the criticism of Citizen Lab. A month after the dinner, the Hungarian-born billionaire advised Peel he should probably extricate himself from the NSO investment. Lawyers for Peel said these were “tenuous and unsubstantiated allegations” and that Peel was committed to “good governance and human rights”. Deibert said the documents suggested Novalpina’s commitment to aligning NSO with human rights principles seemed to be a figleaf. “We have seen enough of their obviously absurd denials in the face of evidence of abuse to understand they do not appear genuinely interested in human rights due diligence as much as making money and crafting a seemingly palatable public-facing image,” he said. “One can only conclude that the bottom line matters more than human rights for those lining their pockets from NSO Group’s sales – including, their executives, owners, and high-priced lawyers.” Krishnamurthy said in a written statement to the Guardian that he and his colleagues had believed when they were retained that Novalpina was serious about making “real changes at NSO”. “However, the NSO Group’s subsequent record of complicity in gross human rights violations shows how wrong we were. I regret my brief time advising Novalpina in 2019,” he said. Krishnamurthy added that he hoped leaders like Deibert and Citizen Lab would “succeed in bringing NSO’s extremely harmful activities to an end”. A US consultancy called Berkeley Research Group (BRG) took over management of the fund that owns NSO last July after an internal dispute between the founding partners of Novalpina.",News/World news,"Private equity executive sought to undermine NSO critics, data suggests",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/28/private-equity-executive-sought-to-undermine-nso-critics-data-suggests
4/28/2022,"A heroin addict convicted of fatally neglecting her seven-year-old son, who died alone in a garden from an asthma attack, has been jailed for 20 years. Laura Heath was found guilty of gross negligence manslaughter of her asthmatic son Hakeem Hussain, who was found dead in a garden in Birmingham in November 2017. Passing sentence at Coventry crown court, Mr Justice Dove said Hakeem’s death was the result of her “catastrophic and deplorable” parenting. The judge told 40-year-old Heath, who was ordered to serve two-thirds of her sentence before becoming eligible for parole, that the death had occurred after her life “entered a drug-fuelled downward spiral into squalor, chaos and tragedy”. The judge said: “It is clear that in [Hakeem’s] tragically short life he had been an inspiration of happiness and affection for people who knew him. “All of that potential for a wonderful and fulfilling life was cut short, extinguished as he collapsed on his own, suffocating, clutching a leaf in the garden. “The truth is that Hakeem died as a result of your deplorable negligence. You had allowed your life to be completely overtaken by your addiction to heroin and cocaine. His death was needless, tragic and a result of your abject failure as his mother.” Hakeem was staying with his mother at her friend’s house after the gas and electric had been disconnected in their own home due to nonpayment. He went outside during the night for fresh air as he was struggling to breathe, wearing only a top and pyjama bottoms in near freezing temperatures, and was found dead the next morning. Heath had gone to bed after smoking heroin and said her son usually woke her up in the night when he was suffering from his asthma. Images shown in court revealed Heath had modified one of her son’s inhalers with foil and an elastic band so she could use it to smoke crack cocaine. Before the trial, Heath admitted four counts of child cruelty including failing to provide proper medical supervision and exposing Hakeem to class A drugs. During the trial it emerged that social services in Birmingham were aware of Hakeem and at a child protection conference to discuss his care, which took place two days before his fatal collapse, a school nurse said “he could die at the weekend”. Andy Couldrick, the head of Birmingham Children’s Trust, said: “There were some clear missed opportunities, [and] some of them are distressingly familiar in terms of other cases.” A serious case review into the contact agencies had with Hakeem and his mother before his death will be published within weeks.",News/UK news,Woman sentenced to 20 years in prison over death of asthmatic son,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/28/woman-sentenced-to-20-years-in-prison-over-death-of-asthmatic-son
4/28/2022,"José Moreno and Katerin Huertas have walked and hitchhiked hundreds of miles. Moreno, 20, wears beach sandals and carries a backpack stuffed with baby clothes, nappies and oat milk. Huertas, 22, carries their seven-month-old son, Kylean, strapped to her chest. They cross a knee-deep river and scramble up a muddy slope in the sweltering heat. But the worst of their journey is yet to come. Ahead of them lies one of the most dangerous border crossings in the world: the Darién Gap, a lawless, roadless region of mountainous jungle, venomous snakes, fast-flowing rivers and murderous drug traffickers that connects South and Central America. According to official data from the Panama government shared with the Guardian, more than 13,000 people illegally crossed from Colombia into Panama via the Darién Gap in the first three months of 2022: nearly triple the number during the same period last year. About 133,000 people made the journey in 2021 – the highest on record for any year by far. The latest figures have alarmed human rights organisations and UN officials, who fear numbers will continue to rise. They warn that the combination of wars and conflict, the climate crisis and the fallout from the Covid pandemic is sending a constant flow of tens of thousands of desperate, vulnerable people from around the world through the Darién Gap – which only a few hundred migrants a year would have braved a decade ago. “There is serious concern that the numbers could go up very significantly,” says Michele Klein Solomon, regional director for the UN’s International Organization for Migration. “We don’t see this abating.” Many of the migrants are robbed, raped and murdered by traffickers and armed groups. Women sometimes give birth along the way. About a quarter of those making the journey are children, most of them under five. “There’s no such thing as a safe route through the Darién,” says Klein Solomon. At least 51 people died trying to cross the region in 2021, she says, adding: “We know that’s a very significant underestimate.” The Guardian accompanied migrants as they set out from Capurganá – a small beach town popular with Colombian tourists on the south-eastern edge of the Darién, accessible only by air or sea – into the jungle. So far this year, about a third are from crisis-torn Venezuela, with nearly as many from Haiti. Others come from as far as Senegal, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Bangladesh, Uzbekistan and China. Most are groups of young men, or families with children. Moreno and Huertas are part of a group of about 20 people heading north, “for a better future for our children”, says Moreno. “Getting to the United States, American soil – the American dream.” The situation back home in Venezuela is “terrible”, he adds. “Crime is rising, the cost of food is rising, and salaries aren’t going up.” He worked for nine months selling fruit on the street in Chile and Peru. Not far behind the Venezuelans on the trail is a group of seven people – including three children aged between one and three – from Haiti. Shiller Rebi, 50, and Herold Louis, 41, spent three years working on construction sites in Santa Catarina, Brazil, to raise enough money for the trek north with their families. “Haiti is in many crises,” says Rebi. “Economic crisis, a presidential crisis … We don’t have work, we can’t earn money to eat, to pay for school.” They hope to reach Mexico and then, maybe, the United States. Also making the journey are two families from Angola. Nine months earlier, Simáo Vieira had fled from the African country, and his job at a telecoms company, after he was attacked during an inter-ethnic conflict. “They were going to kill me,” he says. In Brazil, he had life-saving surgery. But his family experienced racism and struggled to make a living. Vieira, his wife, Ruth and their daughter, Jacira, 12, are now bound for “any country that receives us and treats us well”. Back in Capurganá, taxi drivers shuttle migrants to a camp on the outskirts of town as soon as they step off the boat. “We want to help them,” says Carlos Ballesteros, president of a local civic group. The rudimentary compound of breeze blocks will soon include a campsite, a kitchen and a shop, ready to cater to 1,000 people daily. “Everyone’s earning a little bit of cash,” he says. Here, migrants are told what to expect in the jungle – and encouraged to travel light. “In the jungle you will get to know the dark side of everyone. You have a dream, but you are not obliged to go,” one local organiser tells a subdued group of Venezuelans, including Moreno and Huertas. Then they are left to haggle with some of the 180 local people working as porters and self-described “guides”, who charge as much as $120 (£95) for each person. The Venezuelans insist they can only scrape together 400,000 Colombian pesos (£80) in total, but convince someone to take them as far as the border with Panama. There, they will be handed over to indigenous Guna guides. “I’m not doing harm to anyone,” says Hermán Colina, a farmer in rubber boots with a machete at his hip who has grudgingly agreed to accompany the group. He had himself fled poverty and violence elsewhere in Colombia – four of his brothers were killed by guerrillas, he says. According to Colina, the route has become more organised, safer and quicker, in contrast to chaotic scenes last year, when tens of thousands of migrants were camped in nearby towns. It now takes four or five days, down from more than a week. Colina claims that he has rescued migrants with broken bones and dispatched them to faraway hospitals free of charge. But UN officials and local rights organisation workers say that such activities amount to human trafficking – and that guides often extort, sexually assault and abandon their clients. Katiara Mesa, an official in the mayor’s office in Capurganá, says they have received no reports of such abuses – but concedes that migrants have no way of raising the alarm. An alternative route by sea to Panama also carries deadly risks. In October, three people died and at least six disappeared – including three children – after an overloaded boat sank while carrying about 30 people from Haiti, Venezuela and Cuba. Several of them were buried in an overgrown corner of the local cemetery. Those that make it to Panama still face a journey of 2,000 miles across half a dozen borders to reach the US. In March, US authorities arrested 210,000 people at the border – the highest monthly total in 20 years. Half of those were deported. The US should make it much easier for refugees and temporary workers to get visas in their home countries, say experts. “You shouldn’t have to make it all the way to the US to claim asylum. It’s insane, and only benefits the smugglers,” says Adam Isacson, of the Washington Office on Latin America (Wola), a US human rights organisation. Panama also bears responsibility for the lawlessness of the Darién, says Isacson. “It’s 60 miles of trail. Why is there not a single policeman there? You can’t leave people unprotected for that long.” Klein Solomon says Panama and other host countries such as Brazil, Colombia and Chile need more international funding to receive and integrate migrants. “They haven’t got the resources,” she says. None of the many dangers – or the risk of deportation at their destination – deter the group of Venezuelans from the journey. “We hope all this effort isn’t in vain,” says Huertas, hoisting her backpack again and checking on her baby. “To have the opportunity to get ahead, to work, to give the kids a good future. That’s the most important thing, right?”",News/Global development,Risking it all: migrants brave Darién Gap in pursuit of the American dream,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/28/risking-it-all-migrants-brave-darien-gap-in-pursuit-of-the-american-dream
4/28/2022,"The centrepiece of Edward Gardner’s latest concert with the London Philharmonic Orchestra was the first UK performance of Brett Dean’s Cello Concerto, written for Alban Gerhardt, who gave the world premiere in Sydney in 2018, and also played it here. Dean and Gerhardt have been friends and colleagues for some years, regularly playing chamber music together. Dean’s Huntington Eulogy, for cello and piano, was also composed for Gerhardt and pianist Steven Osborne in 2001. The new concerto is consequently very much tailored to Gerhardt’s virtuosic yet subtle style. In a programme note, Dean describes it as “more about collaboration than conflict, with ideas from the cello being amplified by the orchestra,” which broadly captures its methodology, but doesn’t quite convey the music’s ambivalence of mood or its curious mix of playfulness and intensity. Cast in a single movement divided into five sections, it starts almost as a game with fragments of what sounds like birdsong shuttled between cellist and orchestra. But after a lyrical slow section suggesting concord, two contrasting allegros, exhilarating then violent, gradually threaten the cello’s prominence. The ending is remarkable, as slithering trills, shared between soloist and the orchestral cellos, suggest an uneasy truce of sorts. Fantastically difficult, it was a real tour de force for Gerhardt, who played it from memory, very unusual for a contemporary work. Gardner conducted with tremendous energy, all the while alert to the details of Dean’s complex, at times dense, orchestration. Britten’s Sinfonia da Requiem and Vaughan Williams’s Fifth Symphony were its companion pieces, both written in the shadow of the second world war, and each, in very different ways, expressing desires and hopes for peace. Gardner has long been an outstanding Britten interpreter, and Sinfonia da Requiem was tremendous as the visceral immediacy of its first two movements gave way to the calm contemplation of eternity with which it ends. The LPO played the Vaughan Williams with quite astonishing beauty, as Gardner carefully probed the ambiguities and tensions beneath its surface before finally bringing it to a close in a mood of utter serenity.",Arts/Music,LPO/Gardner/Gerhardt review – tour de force playing in remarkable UK premiere,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/28/lpo-gardner-gerhardt-review-royal-festival-hall
