1/30/2022,"The UK has offered to deploy land, air and sea forces to bolster the defence of Nato countries on their northern and eastern borders as tensions over Russia’s military ambitions in Ukraine deepen. Boris Johnson is expected to speak to the Russian leader Vladimir Putin this week, and travel to the region, despite intense domestic pressure over a possible leadership challenge in the wake of the “partygate” scandal.  Johnson said the extra resources were a sign of Britain’s commitment to its Nordic and Baltic allies, and come after the US president, Joe Biden, promised on Friday to send a small number of American troops to eastern European and Nato countries “in the near term”. The decision aimed to “send a clear message to the Kremlin”, Johnson said in a statement. “We will not tolerate their destabilising activity, and we will always stand with our Nato allies in the face of Russian hostility.” The deployments included sending two warships to the Black Sea, increasing troop numbers and supplying rocket systems in Estonia, on the Russian border, and deploying fast jets to patrol Romanian and Bulgarian airspace from a base in Cyprus, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said. UK officials will travel to Brussels to finalise details of the military support this week. Johnson asked defence and security chiefs to step up efforts in Europe, and told his foreign and defence secretaries to travel to Moscow to meet their Russian counterparts. In the UK, chief of defence staff Admiral Sir Tony Radakin will on Tuesday brief the cabinet on the Ukrainian crisis. Top US officials on Friday urged a focus on diplomacy while saying that Russia now had enough troops and equipment in place to threaten the whole of Ukraine. Mark Milley, the top US general, warned that a Russian invasion would be “horrific” for both sides, and “result in a significant amount of casualties”. Both the US and UK have withdrawn staff and families from embassies in Kyiv, and British travel advice now warns against all but essential travel to the country. The Foreign Office is also expected to announce tougher sanctions on Monday, meaning the UK can target Russia’s strategic and financial interests – despite reported US worries over the extent of “dirty” Russian money in London.",News/World news,UK ready to commit extra forces to Nato allies as Russia tension mounts,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/29/uk-ready-to-commit-extra-forces-to-nato-allies-as-russia-tension-mounts
1/30/2022,"The New South Wales government will unveil a $1bn support package for businesses after a summer of exploding Covid-19 infections caused by the Omicron variant. But the scaled-down, jobsaver-style payment for small- and medium-size businesses will be capped at half of what was offered during the Delta wave of infections in 2021, after the federal government refused a request from the NSW government to split the cost of the package.  On Sunday the NSW government will announce a new $700m small business support program, which will provide payroll support to businesses with turnover of between $75,000 and $50m. The package will provide a payment of 20% of weekly payroll costs to companies that can prove a decline in turnover of at least 40% across January. Payments would range from a minimum of $500 to a maximum of $5,000 a week. But businesses which meet the threshold for the payment would not receive relief for losses incurred during January. Instead, the payment would cover February and be paid as a lump sum. While the size of the fund may increase if payments extend beyond next month, the support plan is considerably smaller than those rolled out during earlier waves of the Covid virus, including $10bn in relief during the Delta lockdown from both the state and commonwealth governments. Despite calls from premier Dominic Perrottet for the commonwealth to split the cost of the package as it did during the long Delta lockdown in 2021, the NSW government has been forced to fund the package itself after the calls for support were rejected by the federal government. By capping the payment to businesses with a turnover of $50m and asking businesses to prove the loss of turnover, the government hopes to avoid a similar situation to the commonwealth’s jobkeeper program which allowed large companies such as Harvey Norman able to claim millions of dollars in assistance despite posting record profits. Perrottet said the package would “help support businesses that experienced the worst effects of the Omicron wave”. “NSW is tracking better than expected and confidence is returning. And as we did with earlier recoveries, we will come through this recent challenge stronger than ever,” he said. The package comes amid increasing pressure on the government to provide support for businesses amid the wave of Covid-19 infections which have swept through NSW since the Omicron variant of the virus arrived in late November. While Perrottet has resisted pressure to increase Covid restrictions amid the surge, businesses have felt the brunt of both a decrease in economic activity and the effect of isolation measures which have led to workforce shortages. In January consumer confidence fell to its lowest point since 1992, when Australia was emerging from recession, while a survey of 2,000 members by the lobby group Business NSW found 40% “don’t have enough cashflow for the next three months”. But while the business support program will be based on losses in January, no retrospective payments will be made for this month. This week the opposition leader, Chris Minns, criticised the government for the time it had taken to announce the package. “Talk to anybody in this state and they’ll tell you that many businesses hoped that they would make up for lost revenue over the Christmas and New Year period,” he said. “They cross their fingers, they kept their doors open, but as a result of the Omicron wave it’s had a severe effect on the NSW economy.” The $1bn package will also include an extension of the commercial landlord hardship grant to 13 March. The payment provides up to $3,000 per month to landlords who provide rental relief waivers to tenants affected by downturns. The fund also includes a further injection of funds into the performing arts sector with the performing arts package extended until April 2022. “As we continue to protect the health and safety of our community, we have to ensure our economy is resilient and our businesses are supported so they bounce back from this most recent phase of the pandemic,” the treasurer, Matt Kean, said.",News/Australia news,NSW to unveil $1bn support package for businesses hit by Omicron outbreak,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/30/nsw-to-unveil-1bn-support-package-for-businesses-hit-by-omicron-outbreak
1/30/2022,"The government has been accused of trying to manipulate announcements on extra funding for poorer parts of the UK in a desperate attempt to save Boris Johnson’s premiership. An extraordinary row blew up after Michael Gove’s Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities released a press statement – before publication of a levelling up white paper this week – saying 20 towns and cities would benefit from a “new £1.5bn brownfield fund”. The release, which named only Sheffield and Wolverhampton as recipients, said the 20 areas “will benefit from developments combining housing, leisure and business in sustainable, walkable beautiful new neighbourhoods”.  Gove added that the “radical new regeneration programme” would prove transformational and deliver on the government’s flagship policy to create a more equal country. “This huge investment in infrastructure and regeneration will spread opportunity more evenly and help to reverse the geographical inequalities which still exist in the UK.” But after the Observer contacted senior sources at the Treasury to ask if its ministers had signed off on the promised £1.5bn, Gove’s department backtracked and confessed that the “new” fund was not new money at all but would be made up of levelling-up funds that had been announced by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, in his spending review last autumn. The confusion was seized upon by Labour and other opposition parties as evidence of the lengths Johnson and his ministers are prepared to go in order to persuade Conservative MPs in so-called “red wall” seats to stick by the prime minister before the imminent publication of a report into the “partygate” scandal this week by the senior civil servant Sue Gray. If at least 54 Tory MPs write to Sir Graham Brady saying they want Johnson to go, it would trigger a vote of confidence in the prime minister. If he were to lose the vote of Conservative MPs it would mark the end of his premiership. Shadow levelling-up secretary Lisa Nandy said the Tories had been caught out trying to spin that extra money had been found for poorer areas when the white paper actually contained nothing they did not already know about. “I don’t think Tory MPs are going to find it very reassuring when the supposed new pot of gold contains not a penny of new money,” Nandy said. The SNP leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, added: “Not only is the government trying to take the public for fools, they are also trying to take their own MPs for fools. It shows the lengths they are prepared to go to keep Boris Johnson in power. It is beyond contempt.” The Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the episode showed the government was not “remotely serious about levelling up this country.” Johnson has spent much of the past fortnight calling and meeting his MPs to persuade them to stick with him as the row about lockdown-busting parties has grown. One former minister told the Observer last week he had been reassured by the PM personally that his area would receive help for local industries – which had persuaded him to stay loyal. In spite of the government’s troubles, the latest Opinium poll for the Observer shows Labour’s lead over the Tories has shrunk to 5pts, with Keir Starmer’s party on 39% (down 2pts compared with a fortnight ago) while the Tories are up 2pts on 34%. But while the Labour bounce over partygate appears to have peaked, and gone into reverse, the party is now favoured by more voters to do a better job than the Tories on 10 out of 14 policy issues, including tackling crime and handling immigration. Both are subjects on which the Tories have traditionally been strong. On crime, Labour is now 3pts ahead of the Conservatives and on immigration it is 4pts ahead. On Saturday night, Gray – who on Friday was asked by the Metropolitan police to make “minimal” references in her report to serious matters to do with the gatherings that the Met is investigating – was understood to have still not yet submitted her report to No 10. Sources indicated she would only do so on a day when parliament is sitting, so Johnson would be obliged to go straight to parliament to make a statement, rather than giving him a weekend to spin its conclusions to the media. One Whitehall source said he expected the report to make “uncomfortable reading for all concerned”. Another said: “Sue Gray is very clear how she wants this handled. She will hand it over on a day parliament is sitting because she believes strongly in the propriety of the process.” Meanwhile there were calls on Saturday night for the Met to be discharged from its investigation because of a “conflict of interest”. The demands came from officials tasked with monitoring the force who claim it cannot be trusted to deliver on such a politically sensitive case. Unmesh Desai, whose questioning at the London Assembly last Tuesday led to the Met commissioner Cressida Dick announcing the investigation, said an outside police force needed to take over the inquiry. Desai, Labour’s London Assembly policing and crime spokesperson, said he was writing to the commissioner this week raising his concerns that Dick’s boss is, in effect, the home secretary, Priti Patel, who in turn owes her position to Johnson. “It’s a clear conflict of interest. Wouldn’t it be better for an outside force to investigate?” said Desai, a member of the police and crime committee which scrutinises policing in London. Speaking on behalf of a number of committee members, Desai added: “You could even call in a retired chief constable to oversee it, the evidence is all there.” Johnson controversially backed Patel after she was found to have bullied staff in an internal inquiry in 2020. The home secretary has recently thrown her full support behind the prime minister over the lockdown parties. Patel had prompted further controversy last year after handing Dick a two-year extension as Met commissioner despite a series of scandals that have embroiled the country’s most senior police officer. Desai will also urge the commissioner to make sure Met officers are investigated for potential breaches of Covid regulations while deployed at Downing Street. He will ask the commissioner to “review” the Met’s diplomatic protection group, which is tasked with monitoring premises such as 10 Downing Street, amid concern they may have colluded by allowing the parties to take place.",News/Politics,Conservatives accused of ‘levelling up’ stunt to save Boris Johnson’s job,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/29/conservatives-accused-of-levelling-up-stunt-to-save-boris-johnsons-job
1/30/2022,"If a Calcutta Cup fixture on the opening day of a Six Nations wasn’t enough to get the juices flowing, the identities of the two men wearing the No 10 jerseys at Murrayfield next Saturday should have rugby romantics everywhere salivating. At 29, Finn Russell may have 52 more caps of Test-match experience to call on than Marcus Smith, but the similarities between Scotland’s chief conductor and England’s thrilling young pretender are not lost on Gregor Townsend. The Scotland head coach shared many of the same qualities as a free-spirited fly-half himself and, as the British and Irish Lions attack coach last summer, witnessed the pair duelling it out after Smith’s late call-up and Russell’s recovery from injury before the final Test in South Africa.  “The quality in that last week, with the way Marcus and Finn were training, was incredible,” Townsend said this week. “We are delighted Finn is with us, but I’m sure England are also delighted Marcus has come through and was playing so well in November. “They are different styles of 10 to maybe 10 or 15 years ago. They have a lot of shared vision and skills in how they play the game, whether that is a passing, running game or a shorter, kicking game.” If Townsend was an early pioneer as an attack-minded 10 – ahead of his own teammates at times, perhaps – success in the Test arena was sporadic, most memorably with the Lions in 1997 and as the ringmaster of Scotland’s 1999 Five Nations triumph. As a player, he tasted victory only once in 10 attempts against England but as a coach he has already triumphed twice and but for George Ford’s injury-time try in that mind-bending 38-38 draw at Twickenham in 2019, it would be three from four. Next Saturday will be Townsend’s 50th Test at the helm and he boasts a better win record than any of his predecessors, including Ian McGeechan and Jim Telfer across their multiple spells in charge. But those two legends both have a grand slam on their CV. The Scots have won three of their five matches three times on Townsend’s watch but never finished higher than third. Fourth place was meagre reward for those hoodoo-busting wins in Twickenham and Paris last year, but expectations have risen with the increasing depth of quality at his disposal. Compared with his first Six Nations foray in 2018 when a front-row injury crisis led to veterans Jon Welsh and Scott Lawson being summoned from the wilderness, Townsend has the rare luxury of having all his frontline troops fit and firing, subject to any late dramas affecting those on club duty this weekend. A few selection issues remain. Townsend has fielded 24 centre combinations in his 49 Tests to date, and Cameron Redpath’s return to fitness poses a dilemma. Is the inside centre, so classy on his lone Test outing at Twickenham a year ago, ready to be pitched back into another Calcutta Cup contest after three outings for Bath following an eight-month lay-off? In Sam Johnson, Townsend has a solid, in-form alternative and another option in the rambunctious Sione Tuipulotu, alongside the defensive kingpin Chris Harris – one of at least seven Lions likely to start against England. The prop Rory Sutherland, after an injury-dogged few months at Worcester and a red card on his recent comeback, may be short of a gallop but the South Africa-born loosehead Pierre Schoeman offers reassurance after a smooth entrance to Test rugby in November. A rejuvenated Magnus Bradbury is also challenging Matt Fagerson at No 8 but the Scots have a settled and confident air about them. There is a growing sense that if a genuine title challenge is to materialise, this could be the year. “That is why we are here,” Townsend said. “We believe in this group and we go into this tournament wanting to be right there in the last week. We know how hard it is going to be, but we have had the experiences to put ourselves in positions like that before and now we have got the players available to us to really challenge every team we will face this year.”",Sport/Sport,Gregor Townsend has ‘belief’ Scotland can claim Six Nations success,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/29/gregor-townsend-has-belief-scotland-can-claim-six-nations-success
1/30/2022,"Wales’s ambition to retain their Six Nations title has been hit by a lengthy injury list but the stand-in captain, Dan Biggar, says they cannot afford to let Ireland dictate in the Dublin opener next Saturday. Wayne Pivac’s champions, who were within seconds of a grand slam last year before conceding a late try against France in Paris, go into the tournament with several key players sidelined. Biggar takes the captain’s armband in the absence of Alun Wyn Jones, who had shoulder surgery in December, with experienced campaigners such as Ken Owens, George North and Taulupe Faletau also on the treatment table. The Exeter lock Christ Tshiunza is isolating after testing positive for Covid-19.  Wales teams are often greater than the sum of their parts, though, and speaking at the tournament launch this week, the Northampton and Lions fly-half Biggar was in bullish mood. “The mindset we’re approaching the game with is we’re going out there to be positive and fire some shots,” he said. “We want to be quite aggressive in the way we play as opposed to absorbing and letting Ireland come out and dictate. “If we give Johnny [Sexton], in particular, time and front-foot ball and lots of it, we’re going to be up against it. It’s up to us to make sure we start the game really well and put Ireland under pressure.” In contrast, Ireland are almost entirely injury-free, although James Lowe is out with a hamstring problem. Andy Farrell’s side enjoyed a heartening autumn campaign when New Zealand, Japan and Argentina were defeated with an attacking approach that has clicked in recent months. The fortunes of the Irish provinces and Welsh regions in the Champions Cup have also been markedly different: Leinster, Munster, Connacht and Ulster have all progressed to the knockout rounds while winless Ospreys and Scarlets finished bottom of Pool A and Pool B respectively, with Cardiff ninth in Pool B. Sexton shone in Leinster’s 10-try destruction of Bath last Saturday, which was their second match in seven weeks after a spell of Covid disruption. But the 36-year-old Leinster fly-half believes a relative lack of recent competitive action can be a positive. “You can look at it two ways: you can say you’re underdone or you can say you’re really fresh and raring to go,” Sexton said. “I think we’re in that [second] bracket. We’ve had enough rugby, guys have been training hard, in the environment I’ve been in [at Leinster] we’ve been training hard, and we’ll get some hit-outs [in camp] that will prepare us really well.” Pivac, meanwhile, said he admires Ireland’s increasingly free-flowing style but that his players will also aim to keep ball in hand in Dublin. “We are seeing some tweaks and some advances in the style that Ireland want to play,” the Wales head coach said. “They were certainly ‘playing’ a bit more in that autumn series and I was very pleased to watch them do so well … because we enjoy playing, and we’ve got on the park at any one time 15 guys who like to get the ball in their hands and not just chase kicks or belt rucks. “They are going to be an improved side from last year’s Six Nations but if you focus on one team, you slip up against Scotland, and we know how good England are and France are.” Considering Pivac’s injury problems, an opening victory for Ireland at the Aviva Stadium is widely expected, but a wounded Wales can be a dangerous animal.",Sport/Sport,Dan Biggar targets danger man Sexton as Wales aim to ‘fire some shots’,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/29/dan-biggar-targets-danger-man-sexton-as-wales-aim-to-fire-some-shots
1/30/2022,"When Eddie Jones repeats something the chances are he wants to send a message, so his persistent pledge that England are “going after” Scotland is telling. These days you can’t have a Calcutta Cup match without the accompanying war of words but as opening moves go, it is pretty tepid. More pertinently, Jones understands the importance of making a fast start and is instructing his players accordingly. “A lot of it is about the mindset and the way you approach the game,” says Jones. “You’ve got to start the game well, get into the game and go after them. We know every time Scotland play against England it is their biggest game of the tournament. But the big difference this year is we are going up there to get them, we are going after them.”  It is a tired trope to highlight the significance of winning the first Six Nations match, but a cursory glance at England’s fixtures demonstrates just how important Saturday’s match at Murrayfield is, with a trip to Rome followed by back-to-back matches at Twickenham an enticing prospect if they are victorious. “If you don’t win your first game you’re chasing your tails,” says the tighthead prop Kyle Sinckler. “So all our focus is to go out and perform in that first game and obviously win. Because once you do that, everything else follows, the team camaraderie, the feel of the group, all that off-field stuff takes care of itself.” The trouble for Jones, though, is that England have lost their opening matches in the past two tournaments. On both occasions Jones has sought to shoulder the blame, for failing to prepare his players well enough, but whereas once fast starts and early tries were the hallmark of his side, another defeat on Saturday would suggest a longer-term problem. That is, in part, why you sense that Jones has welcomed the disruption that England have faced this past week. Not only does the upheaval allow him to stress-test his players, to spread more responsibility through the ranks and empower more players in leadership roles, it might just take a degree of pressure off, too. To describe England’s injury problems as a “crisis” is pushing it – as their rivals were not afraid to point out – and with a fair wind Jones should be able to pick largely the side that shone against South Africa in the autumn, enhanced by the returning Ellis Genge and Luke Cowan-Dickie. As disappointed as he will be to lose his trusted lieutenant for the entire competition, Jones’s squad can at least get on with their campaign without having the distraction of Owen Farrell’s impending return. What Jones does have, however, is a smattering of players set to sample a packed-out Murrayfield for the first time, which brings us back to his determination that they hit the ground running against Scotland. Jones says: “We know the first 20 minutes in particular are going to be fast because Scotland like to play fast. We’ve got a set mindset of how we want to play. We want to be aggressive when we’ve got the ball and we want to be aggressive when we haven’t got the ball and we want to take the rhythm and tempo out of their game and put tempo and rhythm into our game.” When it comes to Calcutta Cup bingo, Murrayfield’s hostility is on most cards but, again, it is a watchword for England this week with supporters set to return to Six Nations matches in their droves. Four years ago Jones was accosted on his train journey back from Scotland, while in 2020 he did not take kindly to things being thrown at players and staff as they arrived at the ground, but he is happy to play the villain again and shield his younger charges. “It’s going to be hostile but the good thing is they’ve got me there and I’m not very popular so I’m sure I’m going to get plenty of abuse and I’m happy to take that,” he says. “[The new players will] love it. Why wouldn’t they? They get to play in the first game of the greatest championship. It’s for the Calcutta Cup. It means a lot. It’s important that they understand what it will be like and our more experienced players will share their experience with the younger guys.” Sinckler now counts himself as one of those as he nears his 50th England cap and he was part of the side who scraped to victory in horrific conditions two years ago. “I tend to get a lot of stick from the fans, especially the Welsh ones, but I love it, it is an unbelievable atmosphere,” he says. “That is what the Six Nations is about, everyone wearing their hearts on their sleeves, representing the country they are from and giving their all to the boys. We have been to Murrayfield a few times and it has been very, very hostile. I remember coming off the bus once or twice and the fans are giving it to you straight away and chucking certain things. “I love the hostility, it just makes everything a lot better in terms of the experience and definitely a lot better than playing in front of no fans. The more the better.”",Sport/Sport,Kyle Sinckler heeds Eddie Jones’s call for England to make fast start,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/29/kyle-sinckler-england-scotland-six-nations-rugby
1/30/2022,"Human beings have a troublesome relationship with statistics. Them and damned lies. The wise treat them with caution, but only a fool, alas, dismisses these numbers as worthless. The hysterical, meanwhile, react extravagantly to whatever they find at the end of their nose and co-opt whichever statistics support their hysteria. This Six Nations has been hailed already as the most competitive and deliciously anticipated in the history of the world, ever. “It says behind me: ‘Rugby’s Greatest Championship,’” said Eddie Jones last week, in front of the mandatory branding, “and I think it is that now by a country mile.”  He should know. England came fifth last year for the second time during his six years. But this claim of Six Nations vitality niggles only because of the feeling we have said it before. Probably this time a year ago, maybe a year before that, too. So, to the statistics. World Rugby’s ranking system, introduced at the start of the 2003 Rugby World Cup, has suffered as ferocious a mauling as any sorry collection of digits in the history of the world, ever, but as a rolling index, responsive only to that other sometimes misleading stat, the result on the pitch, its findings are dismissed by, well, only a fool. After a delve through the rankings at the start of each year since 2004, it is possible to ratify the claim that the Six Nations is better than ever. If we leave out Italy (and more on that later), the average ranking points of the other five (84.9) is higher now than it has ever been at the start of a year, pipping 2019’s 84.8. Even if we include Italy, whose ranking of 70.51 (14th in the world) is lower than it has ever been, only 2019’s figure is higher, just. It is also true, though, that this is no more than the latest year in a golden era for the Six Nations. There seems to have been a step-change after the 2015 World Cup, which marked the passing of a New Zealand team many consider the greatest in the history of the world, ever. The north’s resurgence has been led by England and Ireland, neither of whom have been outside the top five at the start of a year since 2016. The gap between South Africa at No 1 and France at No 5 is now a shade over five points, the tightest it has been. Normally, at least 10 points separate the top five. All of which should put into some perspective the recent travails of Jones’s England. His win ratio of 78.2% is not only by some distance the highest of any England coach (next best, Jack Rowell on 72.4%), it has been achieved in this era of unprecedented competitiveness. But England still struggle on the romantics’ most-prized achievement, that of a grand slam – only one since their own fabled team passed in 2003. One myth that does need debunking is this idea that grand slams are particularly hard to come by. The curious reality is that since the 1990s, when rugby became pseudo-professional, there have been more grand slams than not. Since a grand slam became five wins, rather than four, there have been 11 out of 22. Momentum is the key and the inclusion of Italy has helped on that front. Of those 11 grand slam winners, nine have played Italy in the first three rounds, seven in the first two. No team has ever had to beat Italy in the final round to win one, which means none of the original five nations has ever played the others in the first four rounds and escaped unscathed (bad news for Wales this year). The Italy Question has vexed fans and officials up here for most of these 22 years. The more hysterical regularly demand their ejection in favour of a Georgia or Romania, but the official line has remained consistent – and still does. Ben Morel, the Six Nations chief executive, is certainly more circumspect than his predecessor, John Feehan, whose regular reply to questions about the fate of Georgia et al might be paraphrased with only mild exaggeration as: “We don’t need to give a damn and we don’t.” Morel last week reiterated the stance against change and was anxious to promote the idea of the July and November windows as the opportunity for tier one to bring les autres along with them. This touches on another reality, more longstanding than any of the above. It is not just about playing standards. The quality of the Six Nations may now be higher than ever but the championship has always been, by far and away, the biggest beast in world rugby, its revenues dwarfing even those of the quadrennial World Cup. It is both rugby’s greatest showcase and most brutish menace. The wonder is that the home unions and France have taken so long to close the gap with the southern hemisphere, given the resources available. Could it be that this is the shape of things to come? If so, what hope for any of the others, even the “Big Three” down south? Worse still, the chances of Georgia and Romania joining the party any time soon might be minimal, but those of South Africa would have to be accounted favourable-to-nailed-on. That is another prospect repeatedly denied at official level but, as any coach worth their salt will tell you, don’t watch the hands when a player runs at you, watch the feet – that’s where they’re really going. South Africa’s best players have long played in the northern hemisphere. Now their best teams play up here, too, in the United Rugby Championship. Soon the Springboks will close a deal with CVC, which owns a chunk of the Six Nations. It is next to inconceivable that South Africa do not join in the next few years. Then we really would be looking at Rugby’s Greatest Championship in the world, ever. Hysterical? Maybe. But the numbers always tell in the end.",Sport/Sport,Believe the hype: Six Nations showcases northern hemisphere’s resurgence | Michael Aylwin,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/29/believe-the-hype-six-nations-showcases-northern-hemispheres-resurgence
