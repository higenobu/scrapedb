12/31/2021,"Tesla has recalled close to half a million vehicles in the US to fix rearview camera and trunk issues that the regulators said could increase the risk of crashes. The electric vehicle manufacturer is recalling 356,309 of its 2017-2020 Model 3 vehicles to address rearview camera issues and 119,009 of its Model S vehicles due to front hood problems.  Opening and closing the trunk could damage the cables attaching the rearview mirror on the Model 3, according to filings issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The Model S recall relates to concerns about latches securing the vehicle’s front trunk (known as the frunk). “Unavailability of the rearview camera display may affect the driver’s rear view and increase the risk of a collision,” the NHTSA said. Tesla is not aware of any crashes, injuries, or deaths related to the issues with the recalled vehicles, the NHTSA said, and the company estimates that only 1% of the Model 3 vehicles will display the defect, compared to 14% of the recalled Model S vehicles. The recall is Tesla’s second run-in with NHTSA this month. The regulator announced before Christmas that it is investigating a report that Tesla vehicles allow people to play video games while driving. The issue was reported by Tesla vehicle owner Vince Patton, a 59-year-old retired broadcast journalist, who saw a YouTube video of a Tesla owner playing a video game on his touch-screen while the vehicle was moving. Patton replicated the video in an empty community college parking lot, activating the games Sky Force Reloaded and Solitaire. “I was just dumbfounded that, yes, sure enough, this sophisticated video game came up,” said Patton. “Somebody’s going to get killed,” he said. “It’s absolutely insane.” Tesla’s share price dropped close to 2% on the news.

12/31/2021,"A handful of local administrations in Spain have become among the first in western Europe to offer menstrual leave to their employees, in an attempt to strike a better balance between workplace demands and period pains. This year the Catalan city of Girona became the first in the country to consider flexible working arrangements for any employee experiencing discomfort due to periods. In June it announced a deal with its more than 1,300 municipal employees to allow women, trans men and non-binary individuals to take up to eight hours menstrual leave a month, with the caveat that any time used must be recovered within a span of three months.  “Girona is known for many things and I think today we’re adding a new item to the list as we pioneer the approval of menstrual leave,” the city’s deputy mayor, Maria Àngels Planas, said at the time. “We are eliminating the taboo that exists around menstruation and the pain that some women suffer – that we suffer – during menstruation.” Soon afterwards the Catalan municipalities of Ripoll and Les Borges Blanques announced similar policies. In September the eastern Spanish city of Castellón de la Plana said it had signed an agreement with its 1,500 municipal workers that included a menstrual leave policy similar to Girona’s after requests from several employees. Period policies have long been enshrined in law in many parts of Asia, often rooted in concerns that workplace demands could hinder women’s ability to bear children. In 2016 the Guardian spoke to several women in Japan and China who said they were reluctant to use the entitlement over fears that doing so would antagonise male colleagues or damage their chances of a promotion. That same year Coexist, a social enterprise in Bristol, said it would become one of the first workplaces in the west to embrace menstrual leave, hoping to do away with an office culture that forced employees to choose between working while grappling with severe menstrual symptoms or using sick days or holiday. The decision triggered global debate over the policy’s merits, even as managers at Coexist reported increased commitment and productivity, and research suggested as many as 14% of women had taken time off from work or school due to periods. It was against this backdrop that the local workers union in Girona first proposed the measure. “There was a lot of controversy,” said Sílvia Rubio of the Intersindical-CSC union. Union reps initially considered asking for up to two days of leave a month, but the idea was quashed owing to concerns that it might make employers more reluctant to hire women or give them decision-making roles. “To avoid any discrimination based on sex, we made it so that any hours used would be made up later,” said Rubio. The negotiations with the city council proved another obstacle, forcing them to whittle down their initial request of 16 hours a month to eight hours. But what surprised many of them was that the policy was also a tough sell among some of their colleagues. “There was a lot of conflict,” she said. “We had women who said: ‘My husband has migraines, why can’t he take this leave?’” Others worried the policy would stigmatise women or brand menstruation as something that is always painful. Rubio responded by pointing to the wider picture. “We think it’s fantastic that we’ve achieved this. This is a women’s issue around the globe, there’s a lot of embarrassment around it and nobody is tackling it. We managed to do it,” she said. “But we don’t want the struggle to end here.” Instead she saw the policy as a first step towards building a workplace culture that would allow greater flexibility to address needs ranging from chronic illness to care obligations. “All of this ends up being a journey to improve workplaces for both women and men, and in both the public and the private sector.”",News/World news,Spain’s public sector trailblazers seek to lead way on menstrual leave,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/30/spain-public-sector-trailblazers-seek-lead-way-menstrual-leave
12/31/2021,"The former Afghan president Ashraf Ghani has broken his silence with his first interview since fleeing Kabul four months ago, in effect blaming the international community and in particular the Americans for the fall of the republic. Ghani told the BBC he was rushed into fleeing Kabul on a helicopter by his “terrified” national security adviser, Hamdullah Mohib, and the commander of the collapsing presidential security detail.  “They said the PPS [presidential protection service] has collapsed, [and] if I take a stand they will all be killed,” Ghani said. “He [Mohib] did not give me more than two minutes.” He was speaking to the former chief of the British defence staff, Gen Sir Nick Carter, who was guest-editing BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. The Taliban were clearly on a path to controlling Afghanistan before Ghani’s flight into exile, but his hasty departure ended hopes of an orderly handover of power that might have kept some aid flowing, and scuttled plans for an inclusive government. Now Afghanistan is stalked by famine; its economy has contracted by more than a third, and its health and education sectors have been crippled by an abrupt halt to foreign funds on which they relied. Asked by Carter what he would say to the Afghan people, many of whom “blame you as their leader” for the current catastrophe, Ghani said his biggest mistake had been relying on Afghanistan’s allies. “What they rightly blame me for, they have a total right to, I trusted in our international partnership and pursued that path,” he said. “All of us made a huge mistake assuming the patience of the international community would last.” Ghani criticised Washington for leaving his government out of years of peace talks with the Taliban, claiming that deals signed under the US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad in effect sacrificed Afghans for a smooth departure of US troops. “Process-wise, outcome-wise, the responsibility has to clearly rest with the [American] team,” he said. “We were never given the opportunity to sit down with them [the Taliban]. Ambassador Khalilzad sat down with them; it became an American issue, not an Afghan issue. They erased us.” Khalilzad said in his own interview with the Today programme that the collapse of the republic was due to a “failure of Afghan leadership” and Afghan troops that did not “resist hard” against the Taliban. Six months ago the two men were among the most influential figures shaping Afghanistan’s future; now neither are willing to accept any responsibility for the tragedy stalking the country. Carter asked the former president about any personal regrets that had surfaced in the last 100 days. Ghani did not mention the humanitarian crisis, but he lamented the damage to his reputation and legacy. “My work has been destroyed. My values have been trampled on, and I’ve been made a scapegoat.”",News/World news,Ashraf Ghani blames international allies over Afghanistan’s fall to Taliban,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/30/ashraf-ghani-blames-international-allies-afghanistan-fall-taliban
12/31/2021,"Revellers will be celebrating on the beaches, in the hills, on rooftops, pub terraces and in back gardens as temperatures on New Year’s Eve soar towards record-breaking levels. Tens of thousands of people who will not or cannot throw a party indoors because of Covid concerns, restrictions or a lack of tests are expected to opt to see in the new year alfresco thanks to balmy weather.  Many holiday hotspots are packed with people planning to celebrate in the fresh air while garden centres across the UK have benefited from hosts investing in fire pits and barbecues. Pubs, bars, restaurants and clubs have spruced up outdoor spaces where restrictions allow them to open and are expecting a bumper night despite surging Covid case numbers, with some opting for winter wonderland and apres-ski themes that may make it feel a little more seasonal. The Met Office said on Thursday there was a good chance of the UK experiencing the warmest New Year’s Eve on record, beating the current high of 14.8C in Colwyn Bay, north Wales, in 2011. A low pressure system near Ireland drawing in warm air from the Azores means it is also possible that New Year’s Day temperatures could exceed the 15.6C recorded at Bude in north Cornwall in 1916. “Records are under threat on both days,” said Met Office forecaster Craig Snell. “Even at midnight it is likely to be 10-12C when you would expect it to be more like 3-5C. You won’t need a full winter outfit on and you can probably move your celebrations outside.” While it has been warm, December has been very dull with the UK experiencing an average of 27 hours of sunshine – about 40% less than normal for this time of year. Snell said it was impossible to say if this period of warm weather was due to the climate emergency. “But what we can say is that these sort of extremes are becoming more common.” He pointed out that on Boxing Day the Alaska island of Kodiak recorded a temperature of 19.4C, the highest ever for December in the state. Though many official outdoor public events in the UK have been cancelled, such as the fireworks display in London and Scotland’s main open-air Hogmanay and New Year’s Day events, people are still expected to gather for their own smaller-scale open-air events. The Cornish seaside town of St Ives, a popular new year’s spot, is busy with visitors. Alan Spencer, joint owner of the holiday rental agency So St Ives, said all his properties were let. The fireworks display has been cancelled, but people are expected to gather in fancy dress on the harbour. “Some will be nervous but it’s mostly an outdoors experience,” said Spencer. Hardy types are heading for the hills. Fi Darby, a writer specialising in the outdoors, said she and her husband, Simon, were planning a winter wild camp on Dartmoor. “The intention is to pack everything we need for an overnight stay and breakfast into our rucksacks, and walk off to find a lonely spot within the Dartmoor national park wild camping area. If the weather allows, we’ll be sleeping in bivvy bags but otherwise we’ll take a small tent.” The less adventurous may stick to their back gardens. The Garden Centre Association reported that sales of furniture, barbecues and fire pits are up by 60% on last year. The warm temperatures are not here to stay. Cooler weather is due to move in next week with snow possible in Scotland.",News/UK news,"Balmy new year weather ideal for outdoor parties, say UK meteorologists",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/30/balmy-new-year-weather-ideal-for-outdoor-parties-say-uk-meteorologists
12/31/2021,"On 8 March 2021, women across the world took part in protests to mark International Women’s Day. In Mexico, there is an added poignancy to the annual event, as at least 10 women are murdered in the country each day; in 2021 the date was was marred by additional violence. In the runup to the day fences were erected around the national palace in Mexico City’s main square, where thousands of women were due to gather.  “There was this tension building,” says Mahé Elipe, a French photographer living in Mexico City. “Mexican politicians [have given the impression that they] don’t care about the rights of women. During the pandemic, cases of domestic violence went up while the government prioritised the economy. So many women were without any help.” Mariel Velázquez, 23, a student and women’s rights activist, who was in the crowds protesting on 8 March, saw the fences as a direct affront and rejection of the feminist cause. “There was a metal wall,” she says. “We were mad when we saw that. In a symbolic way, it was a wall between our authorities and us. It’s like they didn’t want to listen to us, or hear anything about the protest.” As women and children gathered in the square, they laid flowers, sang, shouted and chanted slogans, and wrote the names of female murder victims on the fences. In 2020, Mexico recorded the murders of 3,723 women. About 940 of those murders were investigated as femicides but the issue has been belittled by Mexican authorities. Last year, Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, said the topic of femicide had been “manipulated a lot in the media”. Violence erupted and there were clashes between protesters and the police. “The police were really violent,” says Velázquez. “They started shooting at us with rubber bullets. In my head, I was like ‘I’m going to die’ because it sounded like a real gun. Mentally it was a shock for me. I felt pain in my back. They shot me from a distance of less than one metre.” She adds: “I shouted at the police – ‘Stop it! Why are you doing this?’ Their answer was teargas. They threw it at me about 15 times.” Activists tried to tear down the metal fences with hammers and wooden sticks. It was amid this chaos that Elipe took the photo of the unidentified woman in black wearing black goggles and a face mask with Ni una más (not one more) written on it. “This was a moment. I had the impression, without romanticising things, that it was a civil war,” she says. “There was such enormous chaos; women were shouting everywhere, people were throwing teargas, nobody could breathe. The police threw bottles of piss at us. I was just there with my camera taking pictures. “This woman in front of me was calling to others shouting: ‘They’re killing us!’” More than 80 people were injured in the clashes. Velázquez walked home and arrived at around 9pm. Her mother saw her and was shocked. “I had scars everywhere, and the teargas had affected my eyes. I was covered in dirt,” says Velázquez. She is not sure she wants to continue protesting. “It got really dangerous. It’s one thing to protest, it’s another to expose your life to [danger].” The day was also full of emotion for Elipe, whose work often focuses on women’s rights. “There were so many emotions that day. I cried. I can’t talk about it now without getting goosebumps.” She adds: “I see something so beautiful in the idea of solidarity, in these women gathering together and continuing the fight … There’s an incredible strength in seeing what they’re doing, the danger they put themselves in. They’re young women – they make me hopeful for the future.” Both she and Velázquez think women’s rights in Mexico are neglected by the government and don’t get enough attention.

12/31/2021,"Throughout the pandemic, I, like many others, found myself turning to familiar music I listened to as a teenager, seeking comfort in 2000s nostalgia playlists and the hollow, monotonous “landfill indie” of the 2010s. It wasn’t that I especially enjoyed listening to music that I’d last heard on student nights at bad nightclubs in York, or that they marked a particularly happy period of my life. Instead, I returned to these playlists because I found myself unable to listen to new music. Initially, I blamed this on Spotify. It’s well documented that the platform’s recommendation algorithms are less likely to introduce you to new, interesting genres of music than to recommend songs that sound similar to your favourites – producing an endless feedback loop, where music is not something to be enjoyed and shared, but rather a way to fill silences with constant background noise. I was listening to more music than ever, but appreciating barely any of it.In early 2021, YouTube recommended I watch a video called First reaction to “Rock Music” Linkin Park. I immediately clicked on it – the song in the video, Faint, remains my favourite Linkin Park track, and one that has been a constant on my Spotify playlists. The reaction video was made by Desean Hunton, an American rapper, music producer and YouTuber, whose channel, LaydbakDFR, became hugely popular on the platform for its music “reaction” videos, especially those where hip-hop fans listen to rock music and vice versa. Hunton’s video series, Trash or Pass!, shows him discovering songs and genres for the first time, filming live reactions as he listens. In each video, ranging from reviews of the Beastie Boys and Disturbed to UK acts like Dave, we see Hunton dancing, head-slamming, at times even pausing and rewinding the track, to parts that he’s awed by. While there are thousands of music review channels on YouTube, Hunton’s strips the format back to its basics. Absent of overanalysis of lyrics, deep dives into production credits or engaging in the lore of fandoms, Hunton’s metrics are simple: is this a bop?  Hunton’s videos represented a feeling I’d long been missing, even before the pandemic – of the genuine excitement of discovering, enjoying and sharing in something new. Watching his videos over the past year took me back to the first time I’d discovered the rock and emo bands that would define my teens, the first time I’d snuck out of my parents’ house and travelled into London to go to a gig in a shady pub, the first time I went to a music festival (Reading 2008). Reading the comments under Hunton’s videos – overwhelmingly sharing in his excitement – also made me realise that as streaming services continue to eclipse the music industry and the freedom given to artists, they also remove the social culture that made discovering music so exciting in the first place. Bonds were forged through swapping MP3s, making mix CDs and discovering new bands on platforms like Myspace. In all these cases, it wasn’t just about finding the music itself, but also the friendships and relationships that were part and parcel of discovering new bands. Hunton’s videos were a reminder that even at a time when popular culture is increasingly mediated through automation and surveillance-based algorithms, the desire for collective social experiences is still very much present. People find genuine joy in seeing others enjoying themselves.",Lifestyle/Life and style,The person who got me through 2021: LayedBakDFR captured the perfect joy of discovering a great song,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/30/the-person-who-got-me-through-2021-layedbakdfr-captured-the-perfect-joy-of-discovering-a-great-song
12/31/2021,"The chairman of Credit Suisse, Antonio Horta-Osório, broke Covid rules for a second time and may have committed a criminal offence in order to attend the Wimbledon tennis finals in London in July, it has emerged. The latest breach, first reported by Reuters, was discovered through a preliminary investigation by Credit Suisse’s legal team, which found that the former Lloyds Banking Group chief executive broke British quarantine rules by attending the Wimbledon tournament on 10 and 11 July.  The Portuguese banker had flown in from Switzerland, which had been on the UK government’s amber list of countries that required arrivals to isolate for 10 days. Breaching quarantine rules is a criminal offence, according to UK government guidance, which states that police could issue offenders with fines starting at £1,000 and rising to £10,000 for repeat offences. A government spokesperson would not comment on individual cases, but explained breaches could also result in jail time in some circumstances. “Passengers are responsible for ensuring they comply with all travel rules, including providing accurate information on their passenger locator form, and failure to do so could lead to a fine or imprisonment.” The news comes just weeks after Horta-Osório admitted that he breached Covid rules in Switzerland at the end of November, having flown out of the country within three days of arriving on 28 November, despite being required to quarantine for 10 days. Horta-Osório could face a fine worth up to 5,000 Swiss francs (£4,000) if he is found guilty of breaching Swiss rules by authorities reviewing the case in the country’s canton of St Gallen. It is a further embarrassment for the investment bank and wealth manager, which recruited Horta-Osório in an attempt to clean up its reputation after a string of scandals, including the dual collapse of Greensill Capital and Archegos Capital earlier this year, as well as findings that it had spied on former staff. The chairman joined Credit Suisse in April after a decade at Lloyds, where he was tasked with returning the bank to profit and private ownership amid a spate of scandals of its own. Lloyds is still dealing with the fallout of a £245m loan scam at the HBOS Reading branch that predated his appointment in 2011, as well as suggestions the bank tried to cover up the scam.

12/31/2021,"Former British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell on Wednesday was convicted of recruiting and grooming teenage girls for sexual encounters with the disgraced late financier Jeffrey Epstein between 1994 and 2004. Maxwell was arrested last July and was charged with involvement in ex-boyfriend Epstein’s sexual abuse of teenage girls, some as young as 14.  Below is an explanation of what comes next for Maxwell, the youngest child of the late British media baron Robert Maxwell: Ghislaine Maxwell was found guilty of five out of the six charges in her trial, including sex trafficking a minor. The jury came down with its verdict after about 40 hours of deliberation. Jurors did not find Maxwell guilty of one account: enticement of an individual under the age of 17 to travel with intent to engage in illegal sexual activity. Maxwell’s sex trafficking charge is the most serious one she faced, with a maximum prison term of 40 years. In total, Maxwell faces up to 65 years in prison when sentenced. As she is 60 years old it is likely she will spend the rest of her life behind bars. Judge Alison Nathan did not say when Maxwell would be sentenced. She also separately faces two perjury counts that will be tried at a later date. Sarah Krissoff, a former prosecutor with the southern district of New York, told the BBC she expects “a very significant prison sentence” for Maxwell. “Given the involvement of minors, the judge has really great discretion to impose a significant sentence, and based on the evidence that was presented at trial, frankly, I expect the judge to impose a very severe sentence upon her.” Maxwell’s lawyer Bobbi Sternheim told reporters the defense was disappointed with the verdict and will appeal. “We have already started working on the appeal, and we are confident that she will be vindicated,” Sternheim said outside of the courthouse. While the judge dealt several blows to the defense – ruling, for example, that their witnesses could not testify anonymously as some of Maxwell’s accusers did – legal experts said Maxwell would struggle to overturn a guilty verdict. To succeed, her lawyers would have to show that the judge violated federal rules of evidence or abused her discretion, and that the error impacted the verdict. In a statement issued late Wednesday, the Maxwell family said it would support the socialite’s efforts to appeal her conviction. “We believe firmly in our sister’s innocence. We are very disappointed with the verdict,” read the family statement. “We have already started the appeal tonight, and we believe she will ultimately be vindicated.” The two perjury counts relate to allegations that Maxwell lied under oath about her role in Epstein’s abuse during a deposition for a separate civil suit in 2016. Nathan in April granted Maxwell’s request to sever the two charges from the rest of the counts. The two perjury counts each carry a maximum prison sentence of five years. Maxwell will return to Brooklyn’s Metropolitan detention center, where she has been held in isolation since July 2020. Maxwell has said she has been served moldy food at the jail and that the smell of raw sewage has permeated her cell. Maxwell has also been subjected to water deprivation, “hyper-surveillance” by overbearing guards and other unacceptable treatment in jail, according to her lawyers.

12/31/2021,"Since the Covid-19 pandemic began to emerge across the globe almost two years ago, Australia has often appeared to be living in a parallel reality. In November last year, when more than 50,000 people had already died in the UK and daily case numbers were hovering at about 33,000 during a suffocating lockdown, the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, was boasting of packed crowds at rugby games.  In Victoria, the only state in the country to experience a significant outbreak of the virus in 2020, the term “donut day” had been coined to celebrate the arrival of zero new cases of the virus. Australians have largely been content to endure their enforced isolation from the globe on the basis that life continued largely unaffected by a pandemic which has killed 5.4 million people globally to date. But that policy of Covid zero, dubbed “fortress Australia” or “the hermit kingdom”, has now been profoundly deserted after the arrival of the Omicron variant coincided with a loosening of Covid-era restrictions. On Thursday Australia’s largest state, New South Wales, recorded more than 12,000 new cases, up from 6,000 two days earlier. The state is now recording about 1.4 cases per 1,000 people in the population, rapidly catching the UK’s figure of about 2 per 1,000. Victoria also reported a record 5,100 cases, up about 2,000 from the previous record set the day before. States which attempted to eradicate the virus for longer, such as Queensland and South Australia, are setting daily case records. In all more than 20,000 cases were reported on Thursday. Though the leap in cases has mirrored the explosion globally since the emergence of the highly-contagious Omicron variant, much of Australia now finds itself grappling with the reality of living with the pandemic for the first time. On Christmas Eve, two years into the pandemic, Queensland health minister, Yvette D’Ath, warned residents to “get ready for Covid”. Not to be outdone, her NSW counterpart declared “we’re all going to get Omicron”, a stunning departure from public health messaging from only months ago. Though Omicron has driven the increase in cases – by last week it accounted for about 80% of all Covid infections in NSW – the end of Covid zero had long been mooted. As the two-dose vaccination rate reached above 80% in November and weariness with Covid-era restrictions rose, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, became increasingly bullish about the country’s re-opening. “Planes are back in the air, the kids are back at school, the restaurants are opening and a big Christmas is coming for all of us,” Morrison said at the time. Although the federal government attracts most of the attention of the press, Australia is a nation of federated states, and it is those leaders which have driven the response to Covid during the pandemic. The arrival of a new premier in NSW in October after a public scandal heralded a dramatic change in the entire country’s approach to the pandemic. Dominic Perrottet, a 39-year-old conservative Catholic with a background in student politics, quickly adopted what critics dubbed a “let it rip” approach to the pandemic, bringing forward a loosening of restrictions after a long lockdown caused by the Delta variant and agitating for the country to reopen international borders. That approach was quickly followed by other state leaders. While Victoria’s premier, Daniel Andrews, maintained a steadfast Covid-zero policy throughout much of the pandemic, increasing dissatisfaction with a series of gruelling outbreaks which saw the state’s capital, Melbourne, spend more time in lockdown than any other city in the world, led him to declare in October that the policy would not be repeated. “Now we have the vaccine, and quite amazingly Victorians have gone and got the vaccine in record numbers, and really fast, we don’t need lockdowns anymore,” he said at the time. Where Australia’s two largest states have gone, the rest have been obliged to follow. As cases rise across the country even Mark McGowan, the Western Australia premier and most fervent adherent to the Covid-zero approach, has been forced to acknowledge the state will eventually have to live with the virus. When Western Australia recorded five new cases on Christmas Eve after a French backpacker tested positive for the virus, he declared that a scheduled border reopening with the rest of the country on 5 February could become “redundant” if there was significant spread of the virus in the state. Increasing evidence of the Omicron strain’s reduced severity, coupled with Australia’s high vaccination rate, means leaders such as Perrottet have remained bullish about the need for the country to “live with the virus”. But it has presented a test for a country attempting to grapple with a dramatic about-face in its approach to the virus. Perrottet has been forced to back-track on some of the loosened restrictions including a decision to reintroduce an indoor mask mandate, and on Wednesday he urged NSW residents not to line up for PCR tests unless they were sick amid an explosion on Covid testing lines and delays in results. “In every press conference we’ve said case numbers will increase. Now they’re increasing. We need to learn to live alongside the virus and we’re doing just that. And in the meantime there will be inconveniences as naturally as a society we adjust to those settings, and that’s OK,” he said.",News/Australia news,How Australia went from Covid-zero to Covid-central in just a few months,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/30/how-australia-went-from-covid-zero-to-covid-central-in-just-a-few-months
12/31/2021,"A former beauty queen who shot to fame when she killed her husband’s killer in Naples at the age of 18 and went on to become the first female boss in Italy’s powerful Camorra mafia clan has died aged 86. Assunta Maresca, better known as Pupetta, or “Little Doll”, was the daughter of a notorious black marketeer. In the mid-1950s, 18 years old and six months pregnant, she tracked down Antonio Esposito, the Camorra boss who had killed her husband, and shot him dead in broad daylight on a street in Naples.  Investigators believed there had been more than one shooter on the scene, but keen to establish her status and defend her position in the Naples underworld, Maresca always insisted she was solely responsible. During her trial for murder in 1959 she defiantly told the court: “I would do it again!” Maresca gave birth in prison, and after her release 14 years later, was reunited with her son, Pasqualino. In the years after leaving prison she acted in a film that was inspired by her life and opened two clothes shops in Naples. But her private life continued to be turbulent. She moved in with drug trafficker and arms dealer Umberto Ammaturo, and they had twins. But Ammaturo was jealous of Pasqualino, who has ambitions to rise in the Camorra. When Pasqualino was 18, in January 1974, he went to meet Ammaturo on a construction site for the Naples flyover, and disappeared. His mother suspected her lover had murdered the boy and buried his body in cement. As she told the Guardian in an interview in 1995, she grilled her lover to tell her what he had done. But although they fought viciously, her priority was protecting the twins, and she did not leave him. Maresca was later accused of being behind the killing of Ciro Galli, a member of the Nuova Camorra Organizzata, an organisation formed by Raffaele Cutolo in an attempt to renew the Camorra. In 1982, Maresca openly challenged Cutolo during a press conference and in the same year was arrested alongside Ammuturo for the murder of Aldo Semerari, a forensic scientist and well-known neo-fascist. Maresca served four years in prison before being acquitted. The only girl in a family of four brothers, Maresca reportedly showed violent traits as a child and attacked a classmate, causing serious injuries, according to Corriere della Sera. She won a local beauty contest in 1953 and was crowned Miss Rovegliano. Maresca died at her home in Castellammare di Stabia, near Pompeii, after an illness.

12/31/2021,"Victoria Beckham’s fashion and beauty business remained lossmaking in 2020, as the former pop star, her husband David and other shareholders pumped in millions of pounds to keep it afloat during the pandemic. Sales fell 6% compared with a year earlier to £36m, according to accounts filed for Victoria Beckham Holdings (VBH), which owns the former Spice Girls member’s fashion business, as well as the majority stake in her beauty range, which launched in 2019.  However, the company’s £6.8m pre-tax loss was less than half the £15.6m loss for 2019, which the company attributed to better management of its supply chain, and a new business model whereby the brand sold more of its goods directly to consumers. Sales of its high-end clothing slumped when UK Covid restrictions closed stores for several months of 2020, combined with a sharp fall in the number of international visitors to Britain. As a result, Beckham announced in July 2020 she was cutting about a fifth of staff at her fashion label, and was slashing by one-third the number of garments produced for each collection. Beckham faced criticism in 2020 for using public funds to furlough 30 staff at the start of the first Covid lockdown, despite her estimated net worth of £335m, a decision that was later reversed. VBH employed an average of 130 people during 2020, with annual staff costs reaching £9.3m. The highest-paid director earned £120,000 during the year after taking an 80% cut to their salary compared with a year earlier. During the 12 months to 31 December 2020, the company’s shareholders – which include the Beckhams and the private equity firm Neo Investment Partners – were required to provide £9.2m in loans to keep the business going during the early months of the pandemic, as well as repaying a bank loan from HSBC. Shareholders provided a further £600,000 in 2021. VBH forecast it would continue to rely on shareholders for financial support, amid continued economic uncertainty and a change in strategy, leading the firm’s auditors to express uncertainty over its ability to continue as a going concern. However, the group’s directors said they expected the Beckhams and other shareholders to carry on funding the company. The group reported the Victoria Beckham Beauty brand performed well during its first full year of trading, reaching £7.3m of sales in 2020 of its skincare and makeup range, including Posh Lipstick, which nods to Beckham’s nickname in the Spice Girls. During the past six months, Beckham’s fashion label has cut the price of its dresses by as much as 40%, using fewer embellished fabrics and simpler designs, in an attempt to widen its appeal.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Millions pumped in to keep Victoria Beckham label afloat in pandemic,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/dec/30/millions-pumped-keep-victoria-beckham-label-afloat-pandemic
