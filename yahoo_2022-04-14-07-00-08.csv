4/14/2022,"With the ongoing climate crisis and the looming possibility of nuclear war,Noam Chomsky, 93, often hailed as one of the world’s most important intellectuals alive, warns that “we’re approaching the most dangerous point in human history.”

The renowned linguist and social critic has lived through several consequential events of the 20th century. In a recent interview with The New Statesman, he recalled feeling terrified while “listening to Hitler’s speeches on the radio” at the age of 6 and writing about the 1939 fall of Barcelona at the age of 10.

 

It is now, however, that Chomsky says we are “facing the prospect of destruction” of human life on Earth.
 
 
Climate change has been the central topic of Chomsky’s most recent works, in which he writes about the inextricable tie between global warming and capitalism. He has deemed Earth as unsalvageable within the “time scale” that capitalist countries such as the U.S. have made for it, even with the establishment of policies committed to decreasing carbon output.

“There is no one other than Donald Trump –in history– who has done more to try to drive the human race to extinction,” said Chomsky, who added that “nothing else mattered” if the future was destroyed. He listed Trump’s policies focusing on “maximizing fossil fuels” and “cutting back” regulations that addressed climate change.

Chomsky also likened “Trump’s fanaticism” to Hitler’s Nazis rallies, describing, in particular, the strong base of Republicans against addressing climate change as “a truly dangerous insurgency.” He described the party’s disregard of global warming as “a death warrant” for humankind.

 
 
Chomsky’s father, who was of Jewish descent, was born in present-day Ukraine. When asked what Russian president Vladimir Putin’s motivations for invading Ukraine might have been, Chomsky declared that it is not enough to simply write the conflict off as a matter of Putin’s “twisted” mind.

“Putin is as concerned with democracy as we are,” Chomsky told the Statesman, referring to the U.S.’ history of political and economic reach in the East. He cited September 2021, when the U.S. sent Ukraine advanced weapons in the name of “enhanced military cooperation,” as an example.

Chomsky also pointed to “Iran in 1953, Guatemala in 1954, Chile in 1973” before saying, “But we are supposed to honor and admire Washington’s enormous commitment to sovereignty and democracy.”

 
  When asked about Russia’s relationship with China and whether he thought there was a chance of them joining forces to become a superpower under the current circumstances, Chomsky responded that it was a relationship based on strategy rather than a true “partnership.”   Drawing comparisons to the lack of global military support for the U.S.’ invasion of Iraq, which he has denounced as a crime disguised as “noble intentions,” Chomsky predicted that China, along with the rest of the world, would remain largely absent from the war in Ukraine.     Featured Image via The New Statesman (left), BBC News (right) Enjoy this content?

4/14/2022,"White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Wednesday said it is “nice” of the state of Texas to bus illegal immigrants from the border to Washington, D.C., hours after the first bus out of Texas arrived blocks away from the U.S. Capitol building. Last week, Abbott announced that Texas would be sending willing illegal immigrants to Washington, D.C., by bus and plane in response to the Biden administration’s recent announcement that it will lift Title 42, a Trump-era public-health order that has allowed U.S. border officials to quickly expel migrant families to Mexico, next month. “These are all migrants who have been processed by CBP and are free to travel, so it’s nice the state of Texas is helping them get to their final destination as they await the outcome of their immigration proceedings — and they’re all in immigration proceedings,” Psaki said when asked during a press briefing about the first bus arriving on Wednesday. The bus carried dozens of migrants from the Del Rio sector in Texas. The migrants were released into Texas’s border communities by the federal government after coming to the U.S. from Colombia, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, Fox News reported. After the bus arrived in the Capitol, the migrants checked in with officials and had wristbands they were wearing removed before being allowed to leave, the report added. Psaki had previously called Abbott’s policy a “publicity stunt.” The state has sent an undisclosed number of buses to the border communities impacted by an influx of migrants, but the Texas Division of Emergency Management said each bus “has the capacity and supplies necessary to carry up to 40 migrants.” The state has a pool of up to 900 buses for the operation, Texas Division of Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd said last week, according to CNN. “From the [Rio Grande Valley] to Terrell County, a large majority of the communities that originally reached out for support through this operation have now said that the federal government has stopped dropping migrants in their towns since the governor’s announcement on Wednesday,” Seth Christensen, chief of media and communications for TDEM, told Fox News last week. Meanwhile, Psaki doubled down on her criticism of another of Abbott’s policies during the press briefing on Wednesday, this time calling the governor’s order to carry out “enhanced safety inspections” of vehicles that pass through ports of entry a “political stunt.” Abbott directed the Texas Department of Public Safety to carry out the enhanced inspections last week over concern about “cartels that smuggle illicit contraband and people across our southern border.” The governor suggested there will be an increase in smuggling when Title 42 ends. On Wednesday morning, Psaki released a statement that said: “Governor Abbott’s unnecessary and redundant inspections of trucks transiting ports of entry between Texas and Mexico are causing significant disruptions to the food and automobile supply chains, delaying manufacturing, impacting jobs, and raising prices for families in Texas and across the country.” During the briefing, Psaki was asked if she is blaming Abbott for inflation. “Well I think we’re trying to state the facts of what is another political stunt that we’re seeing happen and the impact of it,” Psaki replied. “What we’re seeing is right now, factually, there’s over $1 million in trade crossing over the U.S.-Mexico border every minute. These actions are impacting people’s jobs and the livelihoods of hardworking families in Texas and across the country.” She went on to say that the “unnecessary inspections” are causing “significant delays, which are resulting in a drop in commercial traffic of up to 60 to 70 percent in some ports.” However, the country has been contending with soaring inflation for months now. A Labor Department report released Tuesday showed the Consumer Price Index, a major inflation gauge measuring the cost of the average household basket of goods, came in at 8.5 percent over the 12-month period ending in March. The rise is the largest 12-month increase since the period ending December 1981.
