1/27/2022,"A Tesla driver said he survived a 14-hour traffic jam in snowy weather with 50 miles of battery range left over. Dan Kanninen said he was ""grateful"" he was driving an EV during the I-95 gridlock. Cold weather reduces an electric car's battery range by about 20%. A Tesla owner said he was ""grateful"" that he was driving an electric car when he got stuck in a traffic jam for 14 hours. ""While fellow drivers burned gasoline running their engines to stay warm, my EV intelligently directed power solely to temperature regulation,"" Dan Kanninen, former White House liaison at the Environmental Protection Agency, said in a blog post. ""As other drivers then fretted about their dwindling gas reserves, my EV intuitively monitored my power supply, giving me the peace of mind that other drivers did not have."" Kanninen was one of hundreds of drivers that was stranded on I-95 in Virginia earlier this month. Kanninen wrote the blog post in response to an opinion piece from The Washington Post that alleged the traffic jam would have been worse if every vehicle had been an electric car. The Post's Charles Lane argued that dead electric vehicles ""might have littered the highway for miles."" The former White House liaison pushed back against the opinion piece and said EV drivers are less likely to worry about their car's range in a traffic jam as most owners regularly charge their batteries overnight and at work, while drivers with combustion-engine vehicles rarely maintain a full tank of gas. He also noted he was able to avoid long lines at gas stations, as charging venues were available every 10 miles along the highway. In the post, Kanninen included a picture of himself watching Netflix from his Tesla display amid the traffic jam. He said his Tesla Model 3 had 50 miles of range left when he finally got to a charging station. Kanninen's Tesla model is the electric carmaker's shortest-range model that is available for sale. A Canadian long-haul trucker posted pictures of a different Tesla that was caught in gridlock. —My World Through A Windshield 🇨🇦 (@myworldtaw) January 4, 2022 The I-95 traffic jam was precipitated by a snow storm that downed six tractor-trailers and several trees. On Tuesday, The Washington Post reported that several Northeastern US states are bracing for a blizzard this coming weekend. Cold weather is known to reduce an electric car's battery range by about 20%, according to Consumer Reports. Sub-freezing temperatures slow down chemical reactions in battery cells and requires the car to use more energy to maintain the battery's temperature, as well as heat the cabin. Driving-range anxiety has been identified as one of the main issues the US faces when it comes to the electrification of transportation. A 2021 study found that one in five EV owners switched back to a gas-powered car because of the hassle of charging their electric car. But, Kanninen said its a ""common misconception"" that electric cars perform poorly in cold weather. In 2021, a Tesla driver tested his Model 3 in cold Norway temperatures and said the EV was able to idle with the heat on for about 72 hours. Last week, Car and Driver tested out a long range Model 3 in 15 degree Michigan weather and found that the car could maintain a 65 degree temperature while idling for over 45 hours.

1/27/2022,"A middle-age Southern California man is accused of lying in wait outside local schools for children wearing masks—and then following them around so he can cough at them, spit on them, and taunt them for being “stupid” enough to don the face coverings. The man, captured on video wearing a “Your mask makes you look stupid” T-shirt, has allegedly been continuing his anti-mask harassment campaign for a month in suburban La Crescenta, with a string of alleged incidents under his belt. Fed-up parents finally had enough this week and gathered at the Crescenta Valley Station to demand police take action. “[The kids] were obviously getting scared. He was getting three to five inches away and coughing in their faces,” one parent who witnessed the alleged harassment, identified only as Ned, told CBS Los Angeles. The Crescenta Valley Station, part of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, issued a statement Monday promising a “thorough investigation” into the man after one incident was captured on camera. “Crescenta Valley Station is aware of a video circulating on social media regarding a dispute between an anti-mask adult and others over the masking of children. The incident appears to have occurred off school grounds sometime last week,” police said. In the video, the man can be seen apparently harassing a group of middle schoolers in a mall parking lot, yelling: “Stay scared. Keep your masks on that don’t even work!” One of the kids in the group can be heard shouting back, “We’re 13!” The anti-masker then launches into an expletive-laden tirade at an adult who tried to intervene, screaming, “Look at this grown man with a mask on. What a fricken coward. What a total p—y… Where’d you buy your mask? The stupid store?” He storms off after calling the group a “bunch of idiots.” The anti-masker has allegedly been involved in several similar incidents near schools, with the sheriff’s department saying some of the kids who were targeted reported that the man also spit on them, according to local outlet KTLA. He has also been accused of shoving children in some cases. The man has not yet been publicly identified, but Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department Lt. Robert Hahnlein told reporters that police know who he is and are working with police in Glendale to investigate the incidents. Officers were called to at least one incident under investigation, but the deputy who responded scolded the kids and “decided to lecture [them] about freedom of speech instead of taking their names and writing an incident report,” Emily Lanigan, one of the parents affected, told CBS LA.
