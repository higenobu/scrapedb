1/31/2022,"Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee may not have been the defining celebrity couple of their era, but they perhaps heralded the next: the leaked sex tapes, tabloid infamy and rock’n’roll excess presaged the game of media cat-and-mouse that has now become commonplace. A new drama series on Disney+, documenting their romance and how their stolen sex tape unwittingly ushered in a new era of celebrity pornography, begins next week.  The show also displays Anderson’s surprise rise as a Gen Z fashion icon. From the X-rated Marilyn Monroe in Playboy to a living Barbie doll in Baywatch, Anderson’s fashion aesthetic has become an unlikely fashion reference for celebrities such as Megan Fox and Kourtney Kardashian. Despite being labelled “white trash” at the time, Anderson’s love of revealing outfits seems entirely in keeping with the current revival for low-rise jeans and cut-out looks. Lily James, who plays Anderson, wore a silver cut-out dress to the LA premiere. “So much of what Pam wore has come back around,” said Kameron Lennox, the show’s costume designer. “What Pam was creating was her version of a 90s pinup.” Lennox calls Anderson’s look a “mix of Bridget Bardot and Barbarella, with a rock’n’roll undertone”. As well as sourcing Anderson’s outfits by Versace, Vivienne Westwood and Azzedine Alaïa from vintage dealers – and remaking her infamous latex dress from scratch – the most challenging part of Lennox’s job, she said, was recreating the outfits that were fit for her surgically enhanced figure. “We spent a great deal of time making sure that Lily was wearing pieces the way Pam did,” she said. “For example, we studied the photos and videos of the real Pamela in the Baywatch bathing suit, to make sure the suit laid on [James’s] body the exact way it did in real life.” With a narrative that revolves around making and stealing the couples’ sex tape, the costume designer also faced the challenge of recreating those outfits. “There were many challenges: both of them are scantily clad in many scenes and it was important to us that not only did it look ‘right’, but that they felt confident and comfortable,” she said. Since the trailer was first released for the series in December, searches for “red swimming costume” and “black leather corset” (one of Anderson’s most famous looks) have increased by 74% and 45% respectively on eBay. Smaller details, such as Anderson’s thin eyebrows and oversized furry bucket hat worn at the MTV Awards, are still referenced. And there is also the rock-influenced look of the duo, that feels like a precursor to the modern Hollywood relationships of Machine Gun Kelly and Megan Fox, or Travis Barker and Kourtney Kardashian. “Pam is viewed as a strong, powerful, confident woman that held her own during a very difficult time,” said Lennox. “She inspired many young people that are now adults.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,Pamcore!

1/31/2022,"Hundreds of care homes in England remain closed to relatives because of Covid outbreaks, despite the government promising the return of “unlimited visiting” from Monday. Last week the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) scrapped rules put in place in December that restricted visits.  However, 534 care homes in England reported Covid outbreaks to the UK Health Security Agency in the third week of January and many remain locked down to all but essential caregivers, with one designated person per resident allowed in. The DHSC said last Thursday that from 31 January there would be “no limit on the number of visitors”, adding that “self-isolation periods will be cut and now care homes only have to follow outbreak management rules for 14 rather than 28 days”. Updated guidance on visiting, isolating and testing had not been published by Monday morning, however, leaving many care home managers telling families that restrictions remained. Nadra Ahmed, the chairman of the National Care Association, said the announcement about the easing of restrictions had come at a “challenging time”. “This virus has not gone away and we know there are around 50% of care services with outbreaks in them who will not be able to implement the guidance when it comes,” she said. Helen Wildbore, the director of the Relatives and Residents Association, said there was “confusion and caution as providers hadn’t even seen the new guidance”. Anita Astle, the manager of Wren Hall care home in Nottingham, said she has told relatives they won’t be changing rules immediately. “I don’t know how we are going to do this in a risk-assessed manner if we don’t know how many [visitors] they will be and how long they will be [there],” she said. “We are not just going to be flinging the doors open.” Jenny Morrison, a co-founder of the Rights for Residents group, which is campaigning for care home visiting rights to be enshrined in law, said: “Covid is no longer the biggest killer of the frail and vulnerable, and policies must reflect this reality. There is mounting evidence that thousands of excess deaths during the pandemic have resulted from loneliness and isolation and the government needs to urgently produce outbreak management guidance that takes into account the variety of risks.” The opening-up has started to have some positive effects. Brendoncare, which operates care homes in the south of England, said it would be opening for visits from Monday. Bruce Cutts, whose 89-year-old mother, Jane, is in a care home in Todmorden, West Yorkshire, was able to have her home for lunch on Sunday. “Mum was in tears when she could meet friends she hadn’t seen since December after weeks in a rolling lockdown,” he said, although he expects the reprieve to be only temporary. “The fact the rules have been loosened is great but all that stops as soon as there are two positive tests and the home goes back into lockdown,” he said. “I am sure that in the next week or so there will be another outbreak, which means Mum will be plunged back into safe storage which is crushing her spirit.” Judith Nesbittt, whose 96-year-old mother is in a care home in the north-east, said the isolation has been “heartbreaking”. Her mother ate Christmas dinner alone in her room when she was in 14-day isolation after an emergency hospital visit. Now a staff member has tested positive and there is another lockdown at the home, until 10 February. “As care home staff get on with their lives, there are going to continue to be positive tests, meaning our loved ones continue to be treated as prisoners and locked away from their families,” Nesbitt said. “Life is finite: many residents, including my mum, are running out of the time they should be spending with their loved ones.” The DHSC has been approached for comment.",News/Society,Covid outbreaks leave hundreds of care homes in England closed to relatives,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/31/covid-outbreaks-care-homes-england-closed-to-relatives
1/31/2022,"This vibrant dish is blissfully easy. Nutty, hot, fragrant, mouth-numbing and addictively salty-sweet, the sauce dresses the clean taste of the white fish and greens beautifully. You’ll want lots of rice alongside to soak up all those flavours.  Prep 10 minCook 20 minServes 2 1 big thumb of ginger, peeled and cut into matchsticks2 large white fish fillets (such as cod or bream)2 spring onions, trimmed and sliced diagonally4 small pak choi2 tbsp vegetable oil For the sauce1 star anise, bashed into small pieces2 tbsp light soy sauce1 tsp caster sugar1 tsp chilli oil, such as Lee Kum Kee’s Chiu Chow1 tsp sesame oilSet a large steamer over a pan of simmering water. Take a plate that will fit inside the steamer (or a sheet of foil), sprinkle it with half the ginger and lay the fish on top. Cover with the rest of the ginger, then sit the plate in the steamer over the simmering water. Cover and cook for 10-12 minutes (depending on the size of the fish), until just tender. Meanwhile, gently warm the sauce ingredients in a small pan, stirring until the sugar dissolves, then keep warm. Lift the fish plate out of the steamer, put the pak choi in its place and steam for three or four minutes, until just tender. Keep the fish on the plate, but pour away any liquid that’s collected during cooking. Warm the vegetable oil in a very small pan until sizzling hot. Scatter the spring onions over the fish and, once the oil is very hot, pour it over the top. Transfer the fish to plates with the cooked pak choi, spoon over the soy and chilli sauce, and serve immediately. This sauce works equally well on chunks of steamed turnip or celeriac, alongside the greens and sticky rice. It is a lovely match of flavours.

1/31/2022,"My brother, David de Peyer, who has died aged 87 of pneumonia, exacerbated by post-polio syndrome, was a dedicated public servant and director general of the Cancer Research Campaign. Using a wheelchair after contracting polio aged 20, he led a life of conspicuous achievement in the face of disability. Born in London, David was the son of Charles de Peyer, a civil servant, and Flora (nee Collins), a classical singer. Educated at Rendcomb college, Gloucestershire, he excelled at cross-country running and hockey. During national service in the 1950s he was seconded to the Royal West African Frontier Force, Nigeria, where he served in Kaduna. He was proud to have been chosen to represent Nigeria in a hockey match against Ghana.  During this posting David contracted polio. Although it was a cruel personal blow for a sportsman like David, his disability did not stop him getting on with life. He went up to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politices and economics, assisted by good friends who carried him and his wheelchair up flights of stairs for lectures. After graduating in 1959, he married Ann Harbord, whom he met when she was an English student at Oxford. He joined the civil service at the Department of Health in 1960 and became assistant secretary in 1973, dealing with the terms and conditions of hospital doctors. He was appointed secretary to the 1975 royal commission on the National Health Service and from 1979 to 1984 was under secretary at the DHSS. In 1984 he became director general of the Cancer Research Campaign (now Cancer Research UK), a role he fulfilled with distinction until his retirement in 1996. He then continued to devote himself to public service, as vice-chairman of the Suffolk Health Authority and as a member of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Appeals Panel. He was a trustee of the Disabled Living Foundation and of Research into Ageing. His last public role was as founder member and first chairman of the friends of the church in Middleton, a small village on the Essex/Suffolk border, where he and Ann lived after retirement. They were keen to see the church used as a centre of activities for the local community, which had few other amenities. David loved good food and wine and had a permanent suntan acquired in or by the swimming pool and from the seat of his Triumph Stag convertible. He enjoyed many highly competitive games of garden croquet and racing demon. He is survived by Ann and by his siblings, Andy, Jenny and me.",News/Science,David de Peyer obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/31/david-de-peyer-obituary
1/31/2022,"A reworking of Sophocles’s tragedy Philoctetes by the performance poet, writer and musician Kae Tempest is one of 10 plays in the running for this year’s Susan Smith Blackburn prize for female, transgender and non-binary dramatists. Tempest – an award-winning poet and two-time nominee for the Mercury music prize – was shortlisted for the play Paradise, which was performed at the National Theatre in London last year. It is joined on the shortlist by two plays produced on smaller stages in the capital. Benedict Lombe’s memoir-monologue Lava, which spans from Mobutu’s Congo via post-apartheid South Africa to modern-day London, was presented at the Bush theatre. Amanda Wilkin’s Shedding a Skin, which will soon return to Soho theatre where it ran last summer, was described as a “wondrous weepie” by Guardian critic Arifa Akbar in her review.  Two Irish playwrights have been shortlisted for the prize. Sonya Kelly’s The Last Return depicts prospective audience members waiting for their chance to see a play. With cruel irony, Kelly’s play itself – which was developed by Druid Theatre – is still awaiting the chance to welcome in theatregoers. A full production has been postponed a number of times due to Covid restrictions. Sarah Hanly’s Purple Snowflakes and Titty Wanks, about a convent schoolgirl in Wicklow who dreams of studying musical theatre, ran at the Abbey theatre in Dublin and opens in February at the Royal Court in London. The Guardian’s Helen Meany called it “a bold mix of the sacred and profane”. Australian playwright Joanna Murray-Smith is shortlisted for her play Berlin, a two-hander set in a Berlin loft, and there are four American finalists. Chiara Atik’s Poor Clare is based on the stories of Saint Clare and Saint Francis of Assisi, while in Daniella De Jesús’s Get Your Pink Hands Off Me Sucka and Give Me Back, a modern Dominican-American student encounters Isabella I and King Ferdinand II of Aragon. The characters in Zora Howard’s play Bust mysteriously begin to disappear and Lauren Whitehead explores the US war on drugs in a play strikingly titled The Play Which Raises the Question of What Happened in/to Low Income Black Communities Between 1974 and 2004 and Hints at Why Mass Incarceration Is Perhaps a Man-Made Disease and Highlights the Government’s General Lack of Empathy for Poor People of Color and Dispels the Notion That Our Condition Is Our Fault and Helps Make Visible Why We Riot When We Mourn and Also Tells the Story of Anita Freeman & Her Kids. Leslie Swackhamer, executive director of the prize, said it had been a phenomenal year for new voices in playwriting: “Two of our finalists are debut plays, and nine are first-time finalists for this prize. All of the plays are highly theatrical and probe the burning issues of our times.” More than 160 plays were nominated for this year’s award, which recognises “works of outstanding quality for the English-speaking theatre”. Judges for the 2022 prize are Bridgerton star Adjoa Andoh, playwright Luis Alfaro, lighting designer Paule Constable, director Whitney White, actor Saidah Arrika Ekulona and Justin Audibert, artistic director of the Unicorn theatre in London. The winner will receive a cash prize of $25,000 and a signed print by the artist Willem de Kooning. Last year the prize was won by Erika Dickerson-Despenza for cullud wattah, a play about the Flint water crisis, seen through the eyes of an all-female Michigan family.",Arts/Stage,Kae Tempest’s Paradise among finalists for Susan Smith Blackburn prize,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/31/kae-tempest-paradise-among-finalists-for-susan-smith-blackburn-prize
