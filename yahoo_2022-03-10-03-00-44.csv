3/10/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Crude futures sank as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy indicated that he’s prepared to make certain compromises with Russia to end the war.

The remarks came after the United Arab Emirates said it will call on its fellow OPEC+ members to boost oil output faster, a dramatic U-turn that could set the country against fellow members of the alliance led by Saudi Arabia and Russia. Oil’s vertiginous climb is contributing to a surge in inflation to the highest level in decades. American gasoline prices rallied to a record Monday while diesel climbed to its highest price since 2008. Soaring pump prices amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continue to thwart President Joe Biden’s efforts to tame inflation and alleviate pain for American consumers. “The oil market will remain persistently volatile and crude prices will remain supported until a major de-escalation in the war in Ukraine occurs,” said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. The U.S. and U.K. decided Tuesday to halt Russian oil imports after Shell Plc and BP Plc said they are stopping new purchases, but other European nations have been reluctant to commit to similar action. The International Energy Agency said a recently announced stockpile release will amount to almost 63 million barrels of crude and products, but it has done little to cool prices. Against the market’s fast-moving backdrop, OPEC+ is sitting on the sidelines sticking to its 400,000 barrel-a-day production increase. Russia is one of the key leaders of the cartel, along with Saudi Arabia and a major producer of crude and petroleum products such as diesel. Russia is a major supplier of refined products to Europe and the threat of fuel supplies drying up in the region has sent diesel markets into a frenzy. U.S. distillates inventories fell to the lowest level since November 2014, dropping 5.23 million barrels, according to government data. Double Trouble at U.S. Pump as Diesel Peaks With Gasoline: Chart Oil imports from Russia made up about 3% of all the crude shipments that arrived in the U.S. last year. When other petroleum products are included, such as unfinished fuel oil, Russia accounted for about 8% of oil imports. A planned House vote on the legislation to ban imports was delayed, even as Biden moved ahead with executive action amid growing political pressure to do so. “The market is awaiting the domino effect of mainland Europe announcing a ban, however, with oil majors announcing that they won’t touch Russian oil, there is already a de-facto ban,”said Keshav Lohiya, founder of consultant Oilytics. Shell and BP said they won’t make any new purchases of Russian oil and gas, but they can’t immediately disentangle themselves from the country in part due to long-term contracts. It’s a dramatic U-turn for Shell, which faced heavy criticism for its purchase of Russian crude last week, and could have a huge impact on the region’s oil refining.

3/10/2022,"By Bozorgmehr Sharafedin LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. ban on Russian oil and gas imports is likely to leave more cargoes at sea with no buyers, and the European Union's decision to continue imports was unlikely to make much difference to disarray in Russian oil trade, analysts said on Tuesday. U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday imposed an immediate ban on Russian oil and other energy imports in retaliation for the invasion of Ukraine and Britain said it would phase out imports through the end of 2022. The European Union did not join the ban because it is more dependent on Russian oil and gas supplies. Gas flows to Europe have so far been steady since the invasion, which Russia calls a ""special military operation"", but Moscow on Monday warned that sanctions on Russian oil could prompt it to close a major gas pipeline to Europe. Existing disruption to oil trade, caused by traders steering clear of Russian supplies due to concern they may unwittingly fall foul of sanctions imposed on Russia, is likely to worsen after the U.S. ban, traders said. Buyers will also be concerned about the kind of reputational hit that Shell took at the weekend for buying Russian oil. Shell said earlier it would stop buying oil from Russia and cut links to the country entirely. Shell's decision came days after it faced a hail of criticism for buying Russian oil at a steep discount – a transaction that two weeks ago would have been routine - underlining how Moscow's pariah status is growing even in a market it used to dominate. Russia exports around 7 million barrels per day of crude and refined fuel, about 7% of global supply. ""Redirecting trade flows takes time. It creates dislocation in the market,"" said Roger Diwan, vice president of financial services at S&P Global. ""The more you do have this type of rerouting and we don't know where the volumes are going, the physical world starts to get gummed up."" The new sanctions could leave more cargoes already on the water struggling to find buyers, analysts said. As Biden announced the U.S. ban, there were 34 cargoes of Russian oil aboard 26 ships headed to the United States, most of which was fuel oil but included 3.2 million barrels of crude, according to Houston-based energy strategist Clay Seigle, citing Vortexa data. One U.S.-based trader said that when it comes to trading Russian oil, the situation was ""getting untenable."" Goldman Sachs estimated that more than half of Russian oil exported from ports remained unsold. ""If sustained, this would represent a 3 million bpd decline in Russian crude and petroleum product seaborne exports,"" it said on Tuesday. JP Morgan estimated around 70% of Russian seaborne oil was struggling to find buyers. ""Shipping disruptions in the Black Sea have brought trade deals with the country to a virtual standstill,"" the bank said on Tuesday. BCA Research analysts also said some private companies were boycotting Russian energy, but it saw less of an impact so far. ""Estimates vary but about 20% of Russian oil exports could be affected so far,"" BCA said, adding Russian crude could still make its way to markets such as China. Kpler said there were signs a growing number of cargoes were going to sea unsold. In 2021, energy was the most imported product by the European Union from Russia, accounting for 62% of total EU imports, or the equivalent of about 99 billion euros ($108 billion).
