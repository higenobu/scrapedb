2/18/2022,"The investigation into Bob Saget's death continues to raise questions — even from within the Full House family. A Florida judge granted the Full House star's wife and children a temporary injunction Wednesday to block the release of records from the investigation into his sudden death at the Ritz-Carlton Orlando on Jan. 9. ""The nature of temporary injunctive relief is that there is an opportunity for the parties to come back and present more evidence,"" Los Angeles-based healthcare attorney Harry Nelson, author of From ObamaCare to TrumpCare: Why You Should Care, explains to Yahoo Entertainment. ""So there will be a fuller review, but I suspect that the judge is sensitive to the family’s privacy and that there is not likely to be a different ruling."" The ruling came one day after Kelly Rizzo and Saget's three daughters from his first marriage filed a lawsuit against the Orange County Sheriff's Department and the medical examiner's office to prevent the release of any records — specifically ""photographs, video recordings, audio recordings"" and other ""statutorily protected autopsy information"" — related to Saget's death, which was caused by blunt head trauma. The filing said the ""records graphically depict Mr. Saget, his likeness or features, or parts of him, and were made by Defendants during Defendants’ investigation."" The women would ""suffer irreparable harm in the form of extreme mental pain, anguish and emotional distress if the records were released in response to public records requests or any other reason or purpose."" The filing said media outlets already filed to obtain autopsy documents. Under Florida statutes, a photograph or video or audio recording of an autopsy held by a medical examiner is already confidential and exempt from disclosure with only a surviving spouse allowed access. Interestingly, it's due to a law stemming from NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt's 2001 death. Nelson, who not involved in the Saget case, dismisses any speculation around why the family would want this information private — which has been a buzzy topic in the press and on social media. ""I would assume that the family simply sees further media investigation of the circumstances of Bob’s death as intrusive,"" he says simply. There have been a lot of questions around Saget's death, even from his inner circle. Candace Cameron Bure, who played Saget's daughter on Full House, told Fox News on Wednesday that she's in ""close contact"" with Saget's widow. However, she noted, ""It's been difficult these past couple weeks because of more things that have come out and there's a lot of questions."" Many of the questions are around how Saget sustained his head injury. Last week, the chief medical examiner declared the star's death as accidental and caused by ""blunt head trauma"" likely incurred ""from an unwitnessed fall"" backwards in his hotel room. (A toxicology analysis did not reveal any illicit drugs or toxins. There were signs of Clonazepam, a benzodiazepine used to prevent seizures and treat panic attacks, and the antidepressant Trazodone.) According to the family statement, officials concluded the comedian and actor “accidentally hit the back of his head on something, thought nothing of it and went to sleep."" However, medical experts not involved in the investigation have questioned how he had such an extensive and severe head injury, and said the wounds were unusual for a typical fall. Dr. Gavin Britz, the chair in neurosurgery at Houston Methodist, told the New York Times the injury looked more consistent with a ""baseball bat to the head"" or a fall from ""20 or 30 feet."" Dr. Jeffrey Bazarian, an emergency physician and concussion expert at the University of Rochester Medical Center, said: ""I doubt [Saget] was lucid and ... thought, 'I’m just going to sleep this off.'"" Nelson tells Yahoo, ""While the coverage has portrayed this as mysterious, it is actually sadly common that people suffer head injuries that lead to brain hemorrhage without being aware that they need immediate medical attention. People think they will sleep it off, when they are at risk. This is related to the story of how serous concussions are that has overtaken many contact sports."" A TMZ report Wednesday claimed cops were ""certain there was no foul play and certain the blow to his head had to happen in the hotel."" The ""injury to his head was severe enough that they're sure he could not have made the two-hour drive from Jacksonville,"" where he had a comedy show the night before to the hotel, the story said. Data from the door lock showed nobody else entered the room after Saget did at 2:20 a.m. And he was seemingly up at 3:42 a.m. — when he posted on Twitter. The TMZ report also noted that officers on the scene did not see a bruise on Saget's head, noting it was only discovered during the autopsy. From the story: ""The authorities say it's most likely Bob struck a portion of the bed's headboard that is not padded. We're told it's wood, and the best guess is he hit his head. Since he was under the covers, they believe he quickly lost consciousness. What's interesting ... although authorities on the scene felt the headboard scenario was the most likely, the Medical Examiner never mentioned it."" A rep for the Orange County Sheriff’s Office's tells Yahoo, ""We have said from the beginning that no foul play is suspected. But the additional information in this unsourced story did not come from our office or from Sheriff Mina, which are the only two outlets for releasing official information from the Orange County Sheriff’s Office."" Says Nelson, ""I think the family knows enough about the fact that [Saget] returned to the hotel room and got ready for bed to be sure that there was no foul play here. This was just a tragic story of a person not realizing how serious a head injury was — leading to the experience of further coverage of more details or delving deeper as invasive and voyeuristic public interest."" Nelson adds that it's likely just a case that the family does not ""want to have their memories of him be photos of his body because that would be traumatic to everyone who loved him. They want to honor his memory with the good things we already know and love, and remember him by those things, not by a gruesome record of how he was found."" That seemed to be Saget's daughter Lara's sentiment. After the lawsuit was filed to keep the autopsy information private, she shared a post about ""how poisonous gossip is"" and ""how important privacy is to grieve.""    A post shared by larasaget (@larasaget) Also shared, after the temporary injunction, was a quote from her father saying, ""I care about humanity.""

2/18/2022,"Eric Thompson nearly got away with murder, according to the Honolulu Police, but the 34-year-old entrepreneur was undone by a dropped hat. Thompson was arrested this week in connection with the fatal shooting of his wife’s former acupuncturist and lover Jon Tokuhara. Police first thought the killing was a random act of violence after Tokuhara, 47, was found around 8 a.m. on Jan. 13 dead on the floor of his Oahu studio next to three spent bullet casings. During a month-long investigation, police say they determined that the killer drove a white Chevy Silverado, which was spotted on CCTV camera footage. The truck had been parked outside the clinic in Waipahu, Oahu, for just 45 seconds the morning of the killing. Police tracked down 53 similar cars on the island and found all of the owners, according to Hawaii News Now. Thompson was the only person who did not have an alibi for the morning, but police were perplexed since there was no apparent ties between the men, and Thompson was a successful entrepreneur with no obvious criminal inclination. Though hardly damning, they found it odd that the victim was killed the day before Thompson and his wife Joyce’s wedding anniversary. Upon further investigation into the victim, police found text messages between him and a mystery married woman, including explicit photos in which her face was fuzzy but identifiable. One message between the two lovers expressed concern that the woman’s husband had discovered the affair, with the wife writing to her lover that “he might kill you” if the affair continues, according to local media reports. There were no more communications after July between the pair, and it is unclear whether Thompson’s wife, who was a patient at the acupuncture clinic, continued to see the acupuncturist romantically—or professionally. Studying the CCTV camera footage further, police say they noted that the assailant dropped his hat as he ran from the studio the morning of the murder. A short time later, the cameras picked up a homeless man retrieving the hat, putting it on and walking away. Police were able to track down the homeless man and retrieve the lost hat, which was tested for hair and DNA fibers that police say match Thompson’s. Police briefly suspected Thompson’s wife might have also been in on the alleged murder, according to reports, but she has so far not been charged. Cellphones, the Silverado, and other evidence was taken from the couple’s home Monday by police. Police also recovered 12 firearms registered to Thompson and two that were not registered in Hawaii. It is not clear if any match the shell casings found at the crime scene. Thompson was able to post a $1 million cash bail shortly after his arrest on Monday. It is not clear if he returned home to stay with his wife. He is expected in court on Thursday to face formal arraignment. He faces second-degree murder charges as well as carrying a firearm while committing a felony. Read more at The Daily Beast.

2/18/2022,"Trump's lawyer asked the New York attorney general's office whether it would investigate Clinton. It's a reference to a right-wing conspiracy theory claiming Clinton spied on Trump's White House. This came amid a hearing on whether Trump should sit for a deposition on Trump Organization finances. Former President Donald Trump's attorney Alina Habba asked a lawyer from New York Attorney General Tish James' office whether they would ""go after Hillary Clinton"" in a hearing about whether the former president should be forced to sit for a deposition about his company's finances. ""I want to know, Mr. Wallace, Ms. James, are you going to go after Hillary Clinton for what she's doing to my client?"" Habba said, referring to the attorney general of New York and Kevin Wallace, an attorney representing her in the hearing. ""That she spied at Trump Tower in your state? Are you going to look into her business dealings?"" Judge Arthur Engoron stopped Habba's discussion of Clinton, saying they were irrelevant. ""The Clintons are not before me,"" he said. The conspiracy theory that Clinton spied on Trump while he was in the White House has proliferated through right-wing media outlets in recent days. Insider previously reported it stemmed from a misreading of court documents filed by the special counsel John Durham. The filing in question says a lawyer with connections to Clinton obtained nonpublic data from the White House via a technology executive who had legal access to the data. The lawyer, Michael Sussmann, was charged last year with lying to the FBI, and while the details in the filing raised questions about the ethics of their conduct, it did not accuse the lawyer or the tech executive of spying or hacking. Sussmann filed a motion Thursday to dismiss the case against him, citing ""extraordinary prosecutorial overreach"" and a failure to ""state an offense."" Thursday's court hearing was convened by Engoron to hear arguments on an unrelated issue. James is investigating the Trump Organization's finances and whether it broke bank, tax, and insurance laws by misrepresenting the values of its assets. Her office issued subpoenas to Donald Trump, Ivanka Trump, and Donald Trump Jr. to sit for depositions. Lawyers representing Trump and the Trump Organization have said James should be required to ask a grand jury to force the testimony, in which case they would be granted immunity in the case. James is running her civil investigation parallel to a criminal investigation in conjunction with the Manhattan district attorney's office, which has already empaneled a grand jury. ""The only reason she is doing this is because he is a former president and on the other side of the fence,"" Habba said of James, who ran for attorney general as a Democrat. But Wallace contested that claim, noting that the Trump Organization ""acceded"" to the scope of the inquiry. Wallace also disputed the notion that James targeted Trump because of personal animus. ""This was not someone who was unfamiliar to the office and who didn't already have legal issues around fraud. I don't think any of this would suggest that there was an improper motive or improper purpose,"" he said. ""The legal issues are not unique,"" he said, later adding: ""The president is a citizen. He has to come in and appear just like anyone else.""

2/18/2022,"Amy Cavaliere was just 35 when she woke up one morning feeling like something was off with her health. “I had a heaviness in my chest, and I was having trouble breathing,” she tells Yahoo Life. Cavaliere says she told her husband she wasn’t feeling well but thought that her symptoms were likely due to a panic attack — something she had never experienced before. “My husband kept insisting that I needed to go to the hospital, but I was mad at him,” she recalls. “I wanted no part of that. I have three kids, and my focus was to get them to school.” But Cavaliere says her husband called 911 after she started to hyperventilate and developed a gray tint to her skin. Cavaliere says she was still hyperventilating when the ambulance arrived to her home. While she doesn’t have a strong memory of what happened next, Cavaliere says she was told that she went into cardiac arrest once she was in the ambulance — as she was insisting that she was “fine.” Cavaliere was given a shot of epinephrine, aka adrenaline, and “came back quickly, before going into full-blown cardiac arrest and flatlining.” She was then given CPR, which continued as she was wheeled into the emergency department, and for 45 minutes after her second heart attack. “I was shocked with a defibrillator 10-plus times because they couldn’t regain my heart rate,” she says. Finally, her heart rate recovered, and she was put in a medically induced coma. Testing revealed that she had a spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), a condition that happens when a tear forms in a blood vessel in the heart, according to the American Heart Association (AHA). Cavaliere was transferred to another hospital, noting that doctors “were not confident in my brain health after everything that had happened.” She was in a coma for nine days, and, while doctors eventually determined that she would be OK mentally, she developed “really severe double pneumonia” and had one lung collapse. “That almost killed me,” she says. Eventually, she started to recover. Cavaliere’s story is terrifying, and it raises a lot of questions about the signs of heart attack in women. These can differ from those of men, Dr. Rigved Tadwalkar, a cardiologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif., tells Yahoo Life. “Classically, women will have the usual symptoms that you hear of that are present in men, particularly chest pain,” he says. “But women will also have atypical symptoms more frequently or have them as their primary complaint.” While women do experience the traditional heart attack symptoms such as chest pain or pressure, discomfort in the arms and breaking out in a cold sweat, the AHA notes that they’re more likely than men to have less obvious symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting, and neck, jaw or back pain. Other subtle signs include feeling dizzy or lightheaded and unusually fatigued. “The reason for this is still somewhat unclear,” Tadwalkar says. “It comes down to differences in the sexes, but we don’t quite understand why.” Doctors are getting better at detecting these subtle heart attack signs, though. “There are more women in medicine now than ever before, and that’s certainly played a big role,” he says. “We’ve also conducted a lot more research that’s involved women. As a result, we’ve learned more and have more awareness now that these differences exist.” However, like Cavaliere, women experiencing heart attack symptoms wait longer than men to get help, according to a 2018 study. The study’s authors say that may be “due to the myth that heart attacks usually occur in men and because pain in the chest and left arm are the best known symptoms,” rather than the more subtle signs that can signal something is seriously wrong. Cavaliere now sees a cardiologist every six months, takes medications to control her cholesterol and has to follow exercise restrictions to make sure she doesn’t overexert her heart, which no longer pumps at the bottom. “I’m not in heart failure, which is great after everything I’ve experienced,” she says. “I’m just making sure I’m listening to my body and am not being so stubborn about my health anymore.” Cavaliere, who has partnered with the AHA to raise awareness and is now a certified CPR trainer in her community, is urging women to take action when something feels off with their health. “So many women and moms today are so distracted and busy with life, jobs, children and family that we don’t pay attention to what our bodies are going through,” she says. “Listen to your body and advocate for yourself.” Despite her initial protests that day, Cavaliere says she’s glad her husband insisted on calling for help. “He saved my life.” Susan Lucci, 75, is speaking out about her battle with heart disease. In an interview with Good Morning America on Monday, the All My Children star opened up about recently undergoing an emergency heart procedure for the second time.

2/18/2022,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sixteen groups representing the U.S. construction industry sent a letter to the White House opposing a recent executive order signed by President Joe Biden requiring ""project labor agreements"" in federal construction projects over $35 million. The order signed by Biden earlier this month, is expected to impact nearly 200,000 workers, the White House has said, and offer a potential boost to workers and unions that negotiate these deals. Project labor agreements are collective bargaining agreements between building trade unions and contractors, which set wages, employment conditions, and dispute resolution on specific projects. ""The administration's flawed rationale justifying pro-PLA policies ignores marketplace realities and broad opposition to government-mandated PLAs within the construction industry,"" said the letter, which was sent to the White House on Tuesday. The groups said the labor agreements will exacerbate the construction industry's skilled labor shortage and undermine the Biden administration's ability to meet its infrastructure, affordable housing and clean energy goals. The order, which went into effect immediately, comes on the heels of a $1 trillion infrastructure bill signed into law by Biden that invests in the country's roads, ports and bridges. The new executive order excludes projects funded by grants to non-federal agencies that will make up for a bulk of the projects under the bill. The groups that sent the letter include Associated Builders and Contractors, American Road & Transportation Builders Association, the National Association of Home Builders and the National Black Chamber of Commerce among others.

2/18/2022,"Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor and attorney for Donald Trump, declared on Tuesday night that he has a stash of secret evidence against former secretary of state Hillary Clinton. And it’s in his bedroom. In an interview on the right-wing Newsmax network, Giuliani said he possessed about 1,000 pieces of evidence that no one has seen yet. “I happen to have it in my bedroom, or my den, actually,” he declared. “I’ve had it there for years.” As the variousinvestigations into Trump rapidly escalate, the former president’s allies have been trying to change the topic to his old political rival. It’s not clear what unseen evidence Giuliani claims to have or why he has been hiding it for years. He has admitted to lying to the media as well as not vetting his evidence and just using stuff he’s found online.

2/18/2022,"The fog of war has already descended on the border separating Russia from Ukraine. As recently as a day or so, things seemed to be moving in a hopeful direction, with word of Russian troop withdrawals and ongoing negotiations to avoid the outbreak of conflict. But on Thursday, events took their darkest turn yet. First came confirmation that Russia has merely been repositioning forces, not withdrawing them, and has actually added 7,000 troops in recent days. Then came reports of cross-border shelling in the eastern part of Ukraine, with each side accusing the other of initiating hostilities. This was followed by word that the Russian Federation sent a chilly written response to a document the United States delivered three weeks ago engaging with Moscow's security demands in the region. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs then released a statement about the response, indicating the U.S. had ""ignored"" its concerns. Next came news that Russia had expelled Bart Gorman, the U.S. Deputy Chief of Mission to Russia, the second-most senior diplomat at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. No explanation was given for the move, and the Biden administration has responded by calling it ""escalatory."" President Joe Biden himself then added to the gloom by telling reporters Thursday morning, ""my sense"" is that Russia will invade Ukraine ""within the next several days."" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking before the United National Security Council, echoed Biden's sentiments by calling the Russia-Ukraine crisis a ""moment of peril."" But the most ominous development of all may be the content of that written response from Russia, which, in addition to calling for Ukraine and Georgia to be denied entry to NATO, reportedly demands that no NATO or U.S. military assets be stationed in countries once part of the Soviet Union and that NATO ""military capabilities"" be removed from all countries that have joined the alliance since 1997. One can make the argument that NATO expansion went farther than it should have after the conclusion of the Cold War, contributing in decisive ways to bring us to the brink of war today. But that's entirely different from suggesting the United States and NATO effectively unwind NATO expansion back to 1997. That is and ought to be a complete nonstarter.

2/18/2022,"By Karen Freifeld (Reuters) - New York's attorney general on Wednesday pounced on former President Donald Trump's defense of company's financial statements, saying the five-page statement Trump issued a day earlier contradicted a court filing by his attorneys. ""It is not unusual for parties to a legal proceeding to disagree about the facts,"" the attorney general's office wrote in a letter filed in New York state court. ""But it is truly rare for a party to publicly disagree with statements submitted by his own attorneys in a signed pleading -- let alone one day after the pleading was filed."" Attorney General Letitia James is conducting a probe into whether the Trumps inflated real estate values to obtain bank loans, and reduced values to lower tax bills. Trump's attorneys repeatedly stated that he did not know enough to respond to allegations of inaccurate valuations. But the former president's five-page statement got into detail about possible discrepancies, implying that he had more knowledge than his lawyers said. On Monday, the attorney general's office made public a Feb. 9 letter from Trump's longtime accountant, Mazars, which said the Trump Organization's financial statements for 2011 through 2020 should no longer be relied on and that it would no longer do work for the former president's New York-based real estate business. On Tuesday, Trump issued a five-page statement disparaging the attorney general and other New York officials, calling the investigation a political and racist attack, claiming Mazars had essentially been forced to resign, and defending the financial statements. ""Remember when the attorney general and or District Attorney say they think my financial statements may be high, I don't even include these branding numbers in them, which is far more than any discrepancy they may have,"" Trump wrote. Instead of the ""sham investigation"" of his business, Trump said in another part of the five-page diatribe, law enforcement and the ""fake news media"" should look into former U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton as well as ""murderers, drug dealers and rapists."" In a court filing on Monday in response to the attorney general's allegations of misleading financial statements, Trump, through his attorneys, repeatedly denied he had knowledge or information to form a belief as to the claims. The attorney general is seeking testimony from Trump and two of his adult children, Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump, as part of her civil probe of the company's business practices. Justice Arthur Engoron in New York state court in Manhattan will hear arguments on Thursday on whether subpoenas for the testimony should be enforced.

2/18/2022,"Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley criticized Eileen Gu, an American-born skier competing for China at the Winter Olympics on Tuesday, accusing her of “standing for human rights abuses.” “In terms of the citizenship, look, China or the U.S.? You have got to pick a side. Period,” asserted Haley in an interview with Real Clear Politics. “You’ve got to pick a side because you’re either American or you’re Chinese, and they are two very different countries. … Every athlete needs to know when they put their flag on, you’re standing for freedom or you’re standing for human rights abuses. There is no in-between.” Gu, who won gold in the women’s freestyle and silver in the women’s slopestyle, was born in San Francisco but has chosen to compete for China, her mother’s native country. The decision has drawn criticism from many Americans who say it is unconscionable to represent China given the country’s various human rights abuses, including the ongoing genocide it’s prosecuting against Uyghur Muslims. Gu has avoided questions about her citizenship since winning gold; China does not allow dual citizenship, raising questions over whether the 18-year-old relinquished her American citizenship to compete for China. While announcing her decision in 2019, Gu professed to be “proud of [her] heritage, and equally proud of [her] American upbringings.” She added that the “opportunity to help inspire millions of young people where my mom was born, during the 2022 Beijing Olympic Winter Games is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to help to promote the sport I love.” Meanwhile, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said months ago that the U.S. government delegation would boycott the Olympic Games over the Chinese government’s human rights abuses. “The Biden administration will not send any diplomatic or official representation to the Beijing 2022 winter Olympics and Paralympic Games given the PRC’s ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang and other human rights abuses. The athletes on team USA have our full support. We will be behind them 100 percent as we cheer them on from home. We will not be contributing to the fanfare of the games,” said Psaki at the time.

2/18/2022,"GoFundMe Drayke Hardman Celebrities and people around the country are sending a strong message against bullying after a 12-year-old boy from Utah died of suicide. More than $125,000 has been raised in a GoFundMe campaign for the funeral expenses of Drayke Hardman, a young boy who died by suicide last Thursday after he was repeatedly picked on at school over the last year, CBS station KUTV reported. Drayke's parents, Samie and Andrew Hardman, repeatedly checked on their son's mental health and even asked him if he was having suicidal thoughts, the outlet reported. Drayke assured them that he wasn't. ""He said, 'no, no,' and it was almost like he was disgusted that I would have even asked him,"" Samie told KUTV. Though the school suspended the student who was bullying Drayke, the abuse continued, Samie and Andrew told the outlet. The couple said they noticed that Drayke had a black eye after he returned home from school this month. Then, on Feb. 9, Drayke asked to skip his evening basketball practice. When the family returned home, they discovered he had attempted to end his life, and he was pronounced dead the next day, KUTV reported.

2/18/2022,"TOKYO (AP) — Japan announced Thursday it will ease its tough COVID-19 border controls by increasing the number of people allowed to enter each day and reducing quarantine requirements following criticism that its current policy is unscientific and xenophobic. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said the daily entry cap will be raised to 5,000, including Japanese citizens and foreign residents, from the current 3,500 beginning March 1. The decision is good news for foreign scholars, exchange students and business travelers who have been unable to enter, but does not cover tourists. “It’s not realistic to ease the measures all at once,” Kishida said. He said Japan will study when it can start allowing in foreign tourists while gradually expanding entries of non-tourists. He did not give a timeline. He said quarantine requirements for entrants with a negative COVID-19 tests and a booster shot will be shortened to three days from the current seven, and those from areas with few omicron cases can skip self-isolation. Japan has banned nearly all entry of non-resident foreigners since early in the pandemic. The country, which saw a significant decrease in infections in the fall, briefly announced an easing in November but quickly reversed that decision after the omicron variant emerged in other countries. Kishida said Japan will decide on a further easing of border controls based on a scientific assessment of the omicron variant, infection levels in and outside Japan and quarantine measures taken by other countries. Infection rates are stabilizing but not slowing fast enough, Kishida said. “Now is the most difficult time to cope. I seek cooperation from everyone for just a little longer so we can overcome this difficulty,” he said. Most of Japan is currently under virus-related restrictions. Infections only recently started to show signs of slowing, likely because of delayed booster shots. Nationwide, Japan reported 91,006 new cases on Wednesday, down slightly from a week earlier, after cases exceeded 100,000 on Feb. 5. But experts say the infections are continuing to burden Japan's medical systems, which tend to be overwhelmed easily because COVID-19 treatment is limited to public or major hospitals. Japan has become one of the world’s most difficult countries to enter and critics compare it to the “sakoku” locked-country policy of xenophobic warlords who ruled Japan in the 17th to 19th centuries. Current border rules — scheduled to remain in place until the end of February — allow in only Japanese nationals and foreigners with residency permits. The policy has triggered protests from foreign students and scholars, about 150,000 of whom have been affected. Japanese and foreign business groups have also protested to the government, saying the prolonged border closure has affected investment, business deals, product development and deliveries. Experts say the rules are hurting Japan’s national interest and delaying the recovery of Japan’s pandemic-hit economy. U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel praised the decision to ease border restrictions. He said it will benefit students who are “essential for building long-term people-to-people connections” between the two countries, as well as business travelers who are “vital for ensuring the economic ties” between Japan and other countries, including the United States. Many Japanese have been supportive of the tight border controls because they think troubles such as the pandemic come from outside the island nation. Kishida’s stringent controls are widely seen as politically motivated to gain public support for his governing party in July parliamentary elections. Kishida’s government, however, faces criticism of its slow distribution of booster vaccines due to a delayed decision to reduce the interval between the first two shots and the third to six months from an initially planned eight. Kishida has set a target of 1 million doses a day by the end of February. Only about 12% of Japan’s population has received their third shots. Experts say the low vaccination rate contributes to a growing number of serious cases and deaths among elderly patients.",World/Associated Press,Japan eases border controls amid criticism as exclusionist,https://news.yahoo.com/japan-ease-border-controls-amid-090557660.html

2/18/2022,"The Felicity Ace, a cargo ship designed to transport vehicles, was reportedly evacuated Wednesday as it was in transit near the mid-Atlantic Azores Islands following reports of a fire aboard the ship, according to The Washington Post. All 22 crew members have been rescued, but the Porsches, Volkswagen, and other brand-new cars left on board, which were set to be delivered to North America, might not be so lucky. The 656-foot long ship departed from its origin port in Emden, Germany on February 10, and was set to arrive at its destination port in Davisville, Rhode Island on February 23. On February 16, the vessel let out a distress signal after a fire broke out in the cargo hold. Shortly after, a Portuguese navy patrol boat, along with four merchant vessels, responded to help with the rescue. There's an ongoing effort to bring the situation back under control, according to The Drive, though a photo taken from aboard one of the assisting merchant ships and shared by Greek publication Naftika Chronika on Wednesday shows the Felicity Ace seemingly ablaze from a distance. The Felicity Ace was built in 2005 and has a total load capacity of 17,738 tons. That translates to a maximum load of nearly 4000 vehicles—a non-insignificant amount, especially considering the market's ongoing supply shortages. When reached for comment by Road & Track, a Volkswagen spokesperson told us the company was aware of the situation and was working with local authorities and the shipping company to investigate the cause of the incident. Porsche gave the following statement to The Drive: We believe a number of our cars are among the cargo on board the ship. No further details of the specific cars affected are available at this time—we are in close contact with the shipping company and will share more information in due course. We've also reached out to the firm that owns the Felicity Ace, though we have yet to receive a response. It's unclear right now what will happen to all of the cars aboard the now-abandoned cargo ship as it continues to float through the Atlantic. Buyers waiting for their cars to be delivered have shared their concerns both on Porsche forum Rennlist and Volkswagen forum VWIDTalk, while people on 718forum.com are reportedly receiving a message from the company's ""Track Your Dream"" service notifying them the company is aware of the Felicity Ace situation, and to contact their dealer for more info. Matt Farah, Road & Track contributor and founder of The Smoking Tire, confirmed with his dealer a Porsche Boxster Spyder he recently ordered is aboard the Felicity Ace. He tweeted on Wednesday saying he planned to send the car to DeMan Motorsports to have the firm's 4.5-liter engine upgrade and shorter gearing installed. If things don't improve, though, he might not have a car at all. Not all hope is lost for the buyers of extra-special Porsches, though. Back in 2019 Porsche restarted production of the 911 GT2 RS after four of the last allocations were lost on a sunken cargo ship.

2/18/2022,"By Andy Sullivan WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. government should consider canceling former President Donald Trump's lease of a historic Washington building he made into a luxury hotel before he sells it, a U.S. congressional committee said on Thursday. The committee in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives said recent developments indicated his Trump Organization may have filed inaccurate financial statements when the government leased the property to him before he ran for president. Representatives Carolyn Maloney and Gerald Connolly, the two leading Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform Committee, wrote to ask the U.S. General Services Administration, the federal property manager, to consider terminating the lease, rather than allowing him to sell it for profit. ""No one should be rewarded for providing false or misleading information to the federal government or for seeking to profit off the presidency,"" they wrote. Video: Trump to sell Washington hotel to ARod, others Former New York Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez is now a key part of an investment group seeking to buy the rights to former President Donald Trump's marquee Washington, D.C., hotel, people familiar with the deal told The Associated Press. (Feb. 14) The hotel, at 1100 Pennsylvania Avenue near the White House, became a gathering point for Trump supporters and some foreign government officials during his presidency, and a sticking point for critics who said it violated ethics laws. Trump's company reached a deal last year to sell the money-losing hotel to Miami investment firm CGI Merchant Group for $375 million, which could net him a $100 million profit, according to media reports. New York Attorney General Letitia James accuses Trump and his family of misrepresenting their real estate assets in order to obtain bank loans and lower tax bills. Trump, a Republican, accuses James, a Democrat, of a political witch hunt. Trump's former accounting firm, Mazars USA, said this month it could no longer stand behind a decade of financial statements and said it was dropping the Trump Organization as a client. The committee said those developments cast doubt on the accuracy of financial statements the Trump Organization submitted in 2010 when it applied for the lease and in 2013 when it applied for a construction loan.

2/18/2022,"Russia warned it could be forced to respond militarily if the US doesn't give in to its security demands. Russia has demanded that Ukraine be permanently barred from joining NATO. The US and NATO have been adamant that this is a non-starter. Russia on Thursday warned it could be ""forced to respond"" militarily if the US doesn't agree to its demands for binding security guarantees, including permanently barring Ukraine and Georgia from NATO. The US has repeatedly made it clear that this demand is a non-starter. ""In the absence of the readiness of the American side to agree on firm, legally binding guarantees of ensuring our security by the United States and its allies, Russia will be forced to respond, including through the implementation of military-technical measures,"" the Kremlin said on Thursday in an 11-page response to written proposals submitted by the US in late January on Moscow's security demands. The US and NATO have firmly rejected Russia's demand that Ukraine be forever banned from the alliance, stating that countries should be free to choose their own allies and defensive partnerships. Though Ukraine has sought to join NATO for years, it's not on the formal track to become a member at any point in the near future. But with an estimated 150,000 troops surrounding Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded that the issue be resolved now. Putin has complained about NATO's eastward expansion for years, ignoring the ways in which his aggressive behavior has pushed countries like Ukraine closer to the alliance and to the West more generally. Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014 and annexed Crimea, and since that year has supported rebels in a war against Ukrainian forces in the eastern Donbas region. Experts say Putin's bellicose posture toward Ukraine is linked to his broader ambitions of seeing Russia regain the power and influence it enjoyed across the region and beyond during the Soviet-era. Russia on Thursday once again denied any plans to invade Ukraine, despite its massive military buildup on the border of its next-door neighbor. ""There is no and is not planned any 'Russian invasion' of Ukraine, which the United States and its allies have been declaring at the official level since autumn last year, therefore statements about Russia's 'responsibility for the escalation' cannot be regarded otherwise than as an attempt to put pressure on and devalue Russia's proposals for security guarantees,"" the Kremlin said. Russia has gathered roughly 150,000 troops on Ukraine's border, according to the Biden administration, which has warned that a Russian invasion could occur at any moment. On Tuesday, Moscow claimed it was withdrawing some troops from Ukraine's border, but the US and NATO rejected this and said there have been no signs of Russian de-escalation. The Biden administration has warned that Russia is looking for a pretext to invade, and could use covert operatives to stage some kind of sabotage to try to justify it. ""Russia says it's drawing down those forces. We do not see that happening on the ground. Our information indicates clearly that these forces, including ground troops, aircraft, ships, are preparing to launch an attack against Ukraine in the coming days,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said to the United Nations Security Council on Thursday, amid reports of shelling in eastern Ukraine.

2/18/2022,"By Sarah N. Lynch WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Trump-era U.S. Attorney engaged in ""unbecoming"" conduct when he publicly bashed a federal prosecutor for signing a letter that was critical of then-Attorney General Bill Barr's order to pursue investigations into voting irregularities in the 2020 presidential election, a new report has found. Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz said on Thursday that the ex-U.S. Attorney made inappropriate comments about one of the prosecutors in his office during a press conference. The press conference came after Barr penned a controversial memo ordering U.S. Attorneys offices to pursue ""substantial"" allegations of voting irregularities. Critics said the order was improper because it gave credence to President Donald Trump's false claims the election was stolen, and it prompted the department's top lawyer overseeing voter fraud investigations at the time to resign from that position in protest. Ultimately Barr concluded there was no evidence of wide-spread voter fraud. At a press conference, a reporter asked the U.S. Attorney about the letter, which was signed by a number of assistant U.S. Attorneys (AUSA), including one in his office. In response, the U.S. Attorney ""sought to undermine the AUSA’s professional reputation by referencing that the spouse of the AUSA who signed the letter had previously worked for two U.S. Attorneys General of the previous administration,"" the report says, thereby inappropriately suggesting the AUSA was motivated by partisan political considerations. Those comments ""constituted poor judgment, was unbecoming of a U.S. Attorney or any DOJ leader, and reflected poorly on DOJ,"" Horowitz found. It also ran contrary to internal department guidance, which urged leadership to refrain from commenting negatively because the letter was legally protected free speech. The report does not identify the former U.S. Attorney, but its description closely matches a November 2020 press conference held by Scott Brady, the former U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania. At that event, Brady said one of the prosecutors who signed the letter ""was married to the former chief of staff of Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch"" and had added his name ""unbeknownst to anyone in leadership"" and without talking to an ethics adviser. Brady, now an attorney with Jones Day, could not be immediately reached for comment. (Reporting by Sarah N.

2/18/2022,"Tourists are flocking to catch a final glimpse of a Second World War shipwreck at risk of exploding before it is partially dismantled. The SS Richard Montgomery ran aground on a sandbank in the Thames Estuary in 1944, with 1,400 tons of high explosives aboard. Ever since, the American Liberty cargo vessel's three masts have protruded from the water, a macabre warning of the deadly risk below. The masts are becoming unstable and pose a risk of triggering a catastrophic explosion, so authorities have stepped in and will remove them. That has led to a flurry of interest from sightseers wanting to see the masts before they are gone. Martin Harmer owns the X-Pilot, a former Port of London Authority pilot boat, which offers passenger trips to a number of heritage sites off the Kent coast, including the SS Richard Montgomery. Mr Harmer said there has been a surge in interest in the wartime wreck following reports in December that the masts could be moved. ""We are normally very, very quiet up until around April time - this has blown up beyond all our expectations,"" he said. Visitors were coming from all over Britain, he told The Telegraph, as well as some international guests. Efforts were made to remove the ship's lethal cargo but the salvage operation had to be abandoned with approximately 1,400 tons of munitions still on board. Last year, the Ministry of Defence warned that if one of the masts collapsed, it could detonate the ship's contents and cause “mass damage and loss of life”. Mr Harmer said the ship has an ""air of mystery"" because of the rumours over the years of what could happen if the cargo detonated. He said that the Montgomery was usually only an “add on” to other tours, such as to the Redsands sea forts. However, he is now organising special trips just to the wreck. Such is the current interest in seeing the SS Richard Montgomery that most of the slots in the X-Pilot's weekend sailing schedule are booked up for months. However, Mr Harmer said more trips could be organised if interest continues.

2/18/2022,"By Elaine Lies and Kiyoshi Takenaka TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan will ease border controls imposed to counter the pandemic, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on Thursday, softening measures that have been among the strictest imposed by wealthy nations and have been slammed by business and educators. About 150,000 foreign students have been kept out of Japan, along with workers desperately needed by an ageing nation with a shrinking population, prompting warnings of labour shortages and damage to its international reputation. From March, authorities will raise the number of people allowed to enter to 5,000 a day, from 3,500 now, Kishida told a news conference. ""We will permit the entrance of foreigners except for tourists,"" he said. Measures would be eased gradually and depend on a number of conditions, including the infection rates in other nations, Kishida said. The period of mandatory quarantine will be reduced to three days in some conditions, from seven days now, he said, adding that in some cases there would be no requirement to quarantine. The change comes, Kishida said, as the number of coronavirus infections have shown signs of declining, meaning Japan needed to start preparing for a new phase. Still, semi-emergency measures in place for some 17 regions will remain until March 6, he said. U.S. Ambassador Rahm Emanuel commended the decision, saying in a statement it would benefit foreign students who wanted to come to Japan while still protecting public health. Japan, which has effectively been sealed off to non-residents for two years, briefly eased its border controls late in 2021 but tightened them again just weeks later as the Omicron variant emerged overseas. Japan currently designates 82 nations as ""high risk"" and requires a week of quarantine, including three or six days at a hotel, for many. Two weeks of quarantine were required until mid-January. Kishida and his government have hailed the tight border controls for buying Japan time as Omicron surged around the world, and a vast majority of the public supports them. Yet with the variant now widespread in Japan, which is struggling to roll out booster shots, business leaders and some politicians have warned the measures are obsolete. For Kishida, who faces a crucial election in July, deciding when and how to change the measures has been tricky, said political analyst Atsuo Ito. ""If you look at the overall situation now, they're meaningless: you can get the virus anywhere. But as a result of having them, he got a lot of public support,"" he said. If they're not changed, Ito added, ""the result over the long term is that Japan is going to be left behind the rest of the world.""
