2/14/2022,"Grants awarded under the Coalition’s $184m Safer Communities Fund were “not appropriately informed by departmental briefings”, with more than half delivered without a “clear basis for the decision”, an auditor general’s report into the program has found. The auditor general also found that a total of $1.12m in grant funding was paid out to five separate applicants despite them having projects deemed “ineligible” under the program’s guidelines.  The fund, which falls under the responsibility of the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, was established in 2016 to combat crime and antisocial behaviour. It has paid out almost 700 grants to community organisations across eight selection processes, with more than 80% going to religious organisations. While it was initially aimed at boosting the safety efforts of local councils and community organisations, the fund was expanded in response to the Christchurch terrorist attacks to include protecting schools, preschools and community organisations facing security risks “associated with racial or religious intolerance”. The report found that Jewish and Christian groups were most likely to receive funding, with “relatively few” applications received from other religious groups. Labor’s Kristina Keneally had asked the auditor general to examine the program after revelations that Dutton had asked his department to fast-track a proposal weeks after an industry body made a political donation. The ABC’s 7.30 program reported last year that Dutton had slashed millions in grant funding from organisations that were strongly recommended by the department to improve community safety, with funds directed to projects that did not follow his department’s recommendations. According to the report from auditor general Grant Hehir released on Monday, while largely “appropriate” grant opportunity guidelines for the program were in place, applications were not assessed fully in accordance with the guidelines. “Funding decisions were not appropriately informed by departmental briefings and, for the majority of decisions, the basis for the decisions was not clearly recorded,” the report found. “The recorded basis for the funding decisions did not adequately explain decision making around the award of partial funding to applications, the inclusion and ranking of applications on the reserve lists, or how information other than the results of the assessment process resulted in decisions to award funding.” For 54% of approved applications involving 60% of approved funding, the basis for the funding decision was either not clearly recorded or did not address the eligibility requirements and merit criteria published in the grant opportunity guidelines. While the department clearly identified applications it recommended be awarded for funding, the auditor general found that in all but one of the eight selection processes, “the department did not provide adequate information on the results of the assessment of each eligible application against the published merit criteria”. For six selection processes, the department put forward lists of candidate applications for inclusion on “reserve” lists without any recommendation as to which of those should be selected, or why. Another key shortcoming identified was with the application of a merit-based assessment, with a decision in one round to have a non-competitive selection approach failing to achieve the desired “rapid result”. “The approach meant that applications with relatively low merit scores were approved for funding before applications that had achieved higher scores against the published criteria,” the audit found. It also found that the merit criteria employed in the three most recent selection processes – all within the fifth round of the program – were “less comprehensive than had previously been employed”. The report also found that after the second round of the program, some projects that were not eligible were eventually funded, with no examination of whether items of proposed expenditure were eligible under the grant opportunity guidelines. Instead, this happened during the negotiation of grant agreements once applications were approved for funding meaning “it was not only eligible applications that proceeded to be assessed against the merit criteria”. Even when the merit assessment criteria were applied, the standard of assessment was not to a “consistently appropriate standard” with shortcomings identified in how merit scores were used to recommend projects. A total of five applications assessed as ineligible were approved for funding in two selection processes, with $1.12m in grant funding awarded to those five applications. While the report found that grants were paid out in a way that “was reflective of the population of applications received” in terms of geographical areas and electorates, the audit also found that funding was largely awarded to Jewish and Christian groups. “Applications were received from, and consequently funding was largely awarded to, community organisations that identified as Jewish or Christian. “Relatively few applications were received from, and funding awarded to, community groups identifying as Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu or Sikh. Identified cultural groups were also not well represented in terms of either applications received or grant funding awarded.” Keneally said the report confirmed the Safer Communities program “is yet another example of the Liberals spending taxpayer money like it’s Liberal party money.” “There were many great projects funded through this program, but many missed out because this Liberal Government loves a rort,” Keneally said on Twitter. The Australian National Audit Office report has made five recommendations to the Department of Home Affairs and the department of industry and science about how to improve the program, including a recommendation that the department outlines the “merits of eligible applications against the eligibility requirements, assessment criteria and any other factors relevant to decision making that were included in the grant opportunity guidelines”. The departments have agreed to the recommendations.

2/14/2022,"For a big-budget blockbuster game, Horizon Forbidden West is extremely weird. It is a detailed science-fiction story about a red-haired outcast warrior, the tribes that inhabit a post-apocalyptic Earth a thousand years in the future, and a bunch of robot dinosaurs. It’s a tangle of different ideas and complicated systems that only reluctantly interact with each other. It’s also a damn good time, and especially on PlayStation 5, a stunning example of just how good video games can look in 2022. You kind of get used to its beauty whilst you’re playing, but I found that whenever I returned to the game after making a cup of tea I was newly struck by whatever awesome scene was frozen on the pause screen: Aloy mid-roll away from a murderous mechanical hippo, or standing in the foreground in her war paint with an extraordinary view of mountains and snow behind. It’s when I was out in this world, following whatever trails I found, that Horizon made me happiest. I lost hours out there, retrieving random artefacts from old train stations or crashed planes, collecting SO MANY plants and materials to stuff into Aloy’s magic backpack, and scrapping with the intimidating mechanical creatures that stalk the place. Getting into fights with these things is the absolute highlight of the game. They are aggressive, impressive and varied in both appearance and behaviour; they respond to you intelligently, and the combination of bows, traps and elemental weapons that you hunt them with can make each encounter feel like a battle of wits. It just feels incredible. I could play around all day in this place, trying to shoot the tail off a screeching flying metal monster so I can upgrade my bow.  Following the story, I was less interested. Forbidden West’s plot is – and I say this with some affection, after more than 30 hours immersed in it – a barely decipherable load of MacGuffin-laden sci-fi, all painstakingly written and acted by an engaging cast and scriptwriters who’ve done the best they could with such a sprawling, unwieldy story. Briefly summarised, it boils down to this: Aloy must find a bunch of artificial intelligence subfunctions (riveting, I know) to rebuild a super-AI that can save her world. Conveniently these fleeing AIs have confined themselves roughly to the west coast of the former USA, whose deserts and ruins and mountains make up the enormous map that we’re given to explore with Aloy. (It’s always America, isn’t it? We’re never wandering the post-apocalyptic, overgrown remnants of, say, Liechtenstein, or Norway.) Horizon’s linear chapters highlight its less endearing quirks – the controls, for instance, which are unbelievably convoluted. The first couple of hours give a terrible first impression, introducing all of the slightly annoying things that you’re going to need to get used to. Climbing involves three different buttons. Spend a couple of days away from the game and your fingers will entirely forget how to find their way around the controller in a way that makes Aloy do what you want. The game pulls up little text tutorials throughout, which always made me laugh; I’d suggest that if, after 20 hours with a game, you still need to remind players how to throw a rock or jump backwards off a ledge, then the controls might be a little idiosyncratic. Other random minor frustrations, such as healing being tied to an ever-depleting stash of magic berries, or having to craft ammo mid-fight from collectible resources that can run out, cause minimal suffering out in the wilds – but not in the middle of a tough boss fight at the end of a long story mission, when they can stop you in your tracks. There are a lot more of these weirdnesses, but I became almost fond of them over time. I always enjoy games that come up with entertaining justifications for the extremely video-gamey abilities and goals that they give you, for instance, and Aloy uses old-world technology to scan creatures for weaknesses and highlight all of the collectible doodads on the screen. This is just so bare-faced and convenient as to be straight-up endearing. And though I lost interest in a lot of the (many) conversations that Aloy engaged in out in the Forbidden West, I never lost interest in her. She is a great person through whom to experience this wild and stunning place, competent and inspiring even when you’re fumbling around trying to remember how to call your robot horse, but end up accidentally scarfing a plate of virtual stew instead. I don’t think I’ve seen half of what Forbidden West has to offer. It bored me sometimes with endless dialogue and exposition, but is equally generous with things to do and places to explore and creatures to unwisely provoke. Unlike many open-world games it is continually offering you something new, and a couple of the tools you acquire later in the game really open the whole place up. It’s got the spirit of a Metroid or Tomb Raider-style puzzle adventure on the scale of an Assassin’s Creed. And once again: by god, it is beautiful. I’ll happily endure ten minutes of being lectured about terraforming, in exchange for marvelling at these sunken caves, forbidding plains and mechanical T-rexes.

2/14/2022,"In 1988, shortly before the Winter Olympics got under way and amid rising concerns about the event suffering from good – which for the purposes of the Games would be bad – weather, 500 residents of Calgary with the surnames White, Winter or Snow gathered to perform a snow dance. The event concluded with them chanting “White winter snow, white winter snow, let it go!” before releasing helium balloons with their names on. It did not help: warm winds soon arrived to melt much of what snow there was, temperatures peaked at 18.1°C and 33 events had to be rescheduled. “We simply must make better calculations when awarding future Winter Games,” grumbled Walter Troeger of the International Olympic Committee, an organisation that has since graduated from awarding winter events to places that might not have enough snow to giving them to places that will definitely not have any.  And so to the barren, brown wastelands that at least until the blizzards on Sunday surrounded many of Beijing’s venues, with athletes propelling themselves down the kind of unnatural smears of shocking white rarely witnessed since Adam Ant put away his face paint. There is no point doing snow dances at the Yanqing National Alpine Skiing Centre or at Big Air Shougang, the venue for the ski jumping because, however cold it is, they hardly get any. It is this, more than anything, that makes it an ideal host city. The idea of awarding these Games only to snowy places is romantic but deeply flawed, akin to awarding the Summer Olympics only to inclement locations, getting them to build open-air swimming pools and then hoping it rains enough to fill them up before anyone dives in from a 10m platform. The difference between using a hose to fill an empty pool with water and some clever freezers to cover a dry hillside with snow is only one of – in several senses – degrees. When Beijing was awarded the Games in 2015 the only rival bid came from Almaty, who used the pointed slogan “Keep it Real”. The Olympics long ago gave up on that. The Winter Olympics has relied on fake snow since at least 1964, when the slopes in Innsbruck were constructed using 22,000 ice bricks carved from nearby Lake Herzsee, topped by 25,000 cubic metres of snow hand-lugged from the Brenner Pass and more created by experimental American air compressors. “The runs look peculiar as they plunge twistingly downhill through brown meadows where, one believes, cows will appear any day to munch the spring grass,” wrote the New York Times. But, beyond the hassle of importing or creating snow, warm winter weather has led to some of the great Olympic injustices, foremost among them the tale of Irving Jaffee, a young American who in 1928 headed to St Moritz hoping for speed skating glory. Jaffee was an interesting character, a frustrated wannabe baseball player and protégé of the great Norval Baptie, speed and figure skater, inventor of the airplane spin – performed with the male skater holding his partner by one hand and an ankle – and world record-holder in the disciplines of barrel jumping and stilt skating. In St Moritz that year a warm wind and heavy rain ruined many events – the 50km cross-country skiing was contested, very slowly, in temperatures that peaked at 25C – and the 10,000m speed skating became a race against time as much as anything else. As the ice melted, the event neared its conclusion with Jaffee in the lead, only a handful of stragglers and no-hopers still to go and the Norwegian favourite Bernt Evensen out of contention, the Norwegian referee suddenly declared it abandoned. The Americans appealed – “We don’t want to raise a row,” said their splendidly named official Gustavus T Kirby. “We prefer to win the race on the ice, not in committees, but this action does not seem fair to us.” The IOC agreed and awarded Jaffee the gold only for the International Skating Commission – led by another Norwegian – to overturn the decision on the tenuous basis that US’s appeal had not been received by them within the stipulated three hours of the race’s cancellation. That night many skaters – including Evensen himself – gathered to protest against the decision, but to no avail. Jaffee demanded a rerun. “This is a tough break,” he said, “but I will race them again on skates, skis or at foot-running.” Sadly by then all the ice had melted and many competitors had gone home, so Jaffee had to wait four years to right the wrong. In 1932 Lake Placid hosted the Games and more weather worries. The Scotsman described a venue featuring “black mountainsides, rough with rocks instead of being soft white slopes of snow; bobsleigh runs down which not happy parties of winter sportsmen but streams of thaw-water are coursing; and anxious villagers whose vision of prosperity is, like the snow, slowly melting before their eyes”. Among other problems the meltwater created a large pond precisely where the ski jumpers came to earth, forcing them to attempt their second runs while shivering and soaking wet. “It led,” the British Olympic Committee noted, dryly, “to a lot of complaints.” With admirable prescience Lake Placid had constructed the Olympics’ first artificially frozen skating rink, so the only thing threatening to stop Jaffee racing was the antisemitism of his own teammates, which was so virulent that he ended up – at the suggestion of one of the coaches – in a boxing ring with one of them two days before the 5,000m final and eventually fled the Olympic Village altogether (the Games was based around the spectacular local golf club, founded by the fiercely antisemitic Melvil Dewey, which had a strict policy of not admitting dogs or Jews). He won that event and the 10,000m, with Evensen among those left in his wake in both races, to create a tale of redemption so satisfying one would need ice in one’s veins not to feel warmed by it. In that case I would suggest keeping quiet about it or the IOC might try to host an event in you.",Sport/Sport,"Calgary, Irving Jaffee and a time when the Winter Olympics was far from cold | Simon Burnton",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/14/calgary-irving-jaffee-and-a-time-when-the-winter-olympics-was-far-from-cold
2/14/2022,"Jürgen Klopp has described this as the strongest Liverpool squad he has had at his disposal. That Joe Gomez, Curtis Jones, Takumi Minamino and Divock Origi could not even make the bench supported the theory. Sean Dyche has lesser resources but by his own standards, he had a luxury of riches. Dwight McNeil was dropped for the first time this season. Tuesday’s scorer Jay Rodriguez and new signing Wout Weghorst started in attack. But both missed chances and the reality is that Burnley have scored three goals in nine games. Meanwhile, Maxwel Cornet took McNeil’s spot on the left. The Ivorian can seem a one-man goal-of-the-season contest, but a berth on the wing gave him less chance to let fly. Cornet rarely formed much of a strike partnership with the sold Chris Wood, but at least he offered explosive shooting. For Dyche, the decision is whether to restore him to the forward line. Richard Jolly  Match report: Burnley 0-1 Liverpool At what point do we start taking Wolves seriously as challengers for the top four? They don’t have the resources of Manchester United, Arsenal, Tottenham or even West Ham, but what they do have is a defence. Under pressure in the second half against Spurs, they were admirably unruffled. The bigger issue is goals; only Burnley and Norwich have scored fewer this season than Wolves’ 21 – which puts them on track for a paltry 36. To put that in context, no side has finished in the top four of the Premier League with fewer than the 45 Everton managed in 2004-05. Perhaps Daniel Podence, if he gets off the mark, will go on a spree or perhaps the return of Hwang Hee-chan will bring goals. Either way, if they are to qualify for the Champions League they probably need some from somewhere, no matter how good the rearguard. Jonathan Wilson Match report: Tottenham 0-2 Wolves In an entertaining first half-hour of Manchester City’s visit to Norwich, there were a few elements that might have aroused Jürgen Klopp’s curiosity. City were sometimes sloppy under pressure inside their own half, giving away possession cheaply, while it was clear enough that Oleksandr Zinchenko and Nathan Aké are downgrades on Aymeric Laporte and João Cancelo. Those concerns proved short-lived, Grant Hanley missing Norwich’s big chance when he headed against the post and City ultimately winning with characteristic ease. They show no sign of letting up and, once they go ahead, invariably control games masterfully. The crumb of comfort for Liverpool is that they are not flawless and, just as Arsenal did last month before shooting themselves in the foot, better opponents might punish those laxer moments. It needs to happen soon if we are to see a title race: Klopp will hope Harry Kane and Son Heung-min are primed to pounce on any early errors at the Etihad next weekend. Nick Ames Match report: Norwich 0-4 Manchester City West Ham showed their spirit again with a late equaliser at Leicester but it left them only just clinging to fourth place. Now that there’s a clear bottom three, the race for fourth ought to be the most interesting thing about the Premier League. There’s just one problem: the contenders don’t seem very bothered. Spurs have lost three games on the trot, Manchester United have become draw specialists and West Ham’s only win in four is a meagre 1-0 against Watford. Chelsea, who led the table on 1 December, have slumped so badly that they may yet join the dogfight. And so could Wolves, who suddenly have four wins in five. They are now above Spurs. The same goes for Arsenal, whose winner at Molineux on Thursday was their first goal since New Year’s Day. If any of these clubs can go on a decent run, they’ll find themselves in the Champions League. Tim de Lisle Match report: Leicester City 2-2 West Ham United Ralf Rangnick admits he is worried about Manchester United’s prospects of a top-four finish. “It has always been a concern since Ole [Gunnar Solskjær] left the club. That was one of the reasons why he probably had to leave,” the 63-year-old said. This was a third time in the last five league matches Rangnick’s team have let a second-half lead slip, Aston Villa and Burnley also coming from behind to share a draw. After 24 matches United are fifth on 40 points. One theory proposed to the German is that his footballers tire late on in games due a lack of fitness that stops them maintaining his high-pressing style. “To be honest I don’t know if we are fit enough to play that way because I came in the middle of the season, we had no pre-season [together] - in essence we had in total two weeks in total where we could train in a normal way,” Rangnick said. “I wouldn’t allow myself to say we are not fit enough to play like that.” Jamie Jackson  Match report: Manchester United 1-1 Southampton Beyond the three points and an impressive team performance for Brighton, a first 90 minutes of the year and a second assist of the season made Saturday’s a landmark game for Tariq Lamptey, who continued his return from serious hamstring injury. “It’s hard for any player to expect to be fantastic every week,” Graham Potter said. “Today I thought he had everything.” It was telling that both Watford’s left-back, Hassane Kamara, and Emmanuel Dennis, who played on the left wing in the second half, were booked for fouling Lamptey as the home side struggled to control his surges; he has only had more touches in three other Premier League games than he did on Saturday, and never pressed players in possession on more occasions. It was also a key game for another player recovering from injury, Ismaïla Sarr playing for the first time since damaging a knee ligament in his club’s last victory, three months ago next week; he had Watford’s one shot on target, in the 88th minute. If his seems to have been a swift and impressive recovery, his club is running out of time to stage one of their own. Simon Burnton Match report: Watford 0-2 Brighton Frank Lampard joined the standing ovation for Anthony Gordon when the 20-year-old was substituted towards the end of a precious win over Leeds. A host of Everton players deserved such acclaim – any of Alex Iwobi, Jonjoe Kenny, Donny van de Beek and Richarlison could also have laid claim to the man of the match award – but the blossoming talent, involved in all three goals and in Leeds’ faces from the first whistle, enthralled his supporters and manager. “He can go a really long way in the game and his job now is to keep his head down and keep working,” said Lampard. “But I’ve no worries about that. I can see he wants it.” The feeling is mutual. As Gordon said of his new manager: “I feel the trust he has got in me. He tells me daily. He has surprised me, really, with how good he is tactically. We need to start giving recognition to young English managers such as the gaffer. He is a tactical genius and I am thriving off that. I’m learning from him every day, stuff I hadn’t heard before.” Andy Hunter Match report: Everton 3-0 Leeds Crystal Palace’s draw with Brentford meant it is now just one win in eight Premier League matches since beating Everton on 12 December – a statistic that does not please Patrick Vieira. Having passed up the opportunity to seal what could have been a crucial three points against Norwich in midweek after slipping while taking a penalty, Wilfried Zaha was singled out by his manger as someone who can provide a regular goal threat for a team that has scored only three in the last four games. “There was a cross delivered by Joel Ward at the end when I wanted Wilfried to be there. To compete for that cross,” said Vieira. “We have to work on that, as well as the desire for other players to get into the box.” Ed Aarons  Match report: Brentford 0-0 Crystal Palace At the final whistle Dan Burn looked almost shellshocked. Twenty years after being released by Newcastle’s academy as a nine-year-old he had just made his debut after a £13m move from Brighton and shone in central defence. Small wonder that, as Burn joined his new teammates in applauding all corners of St James’ Park, he sometimes stopped and simply stared. Born and brought up in Northumberland, Burn used to cheer Newcastle on from the stands he now gazed at and, as he began his career with Blyth Spartans and then Darlington, he can rarely have imagined one day returning as man of the match. Eddie Howe may have failed with January bids for Lille’s Sven Botman and Sevilla’s Diego Carlos but on this evidence Newcastle’s manager could not have bought a defender with more assured positional sense. Louise Taylor Match report: Newcastle 1-0 Aston Villa Manchester United’s misfiring marksmen hogged the headlines as usual, but at Old Trafford it was actually Southampton who were more culpable. Only four of their 13 attempts were on target (United managed seven out of 12). Ralf Rangnick rightly argued that United should have scored three by half-time, but failed to add that the same was true of their opponents. On the right, Stuart Armstrong kept bustling into good positions without finding the finishing touch. In the middle, Armando Broja bothered the United centre-backs with his strength and ingenuity but only troubled David de Gea once. The other centre-forward, Che Adams, took the equaliser beautifully but only after wasting a couple of early chances, one of them when he slipped in front of a near-open goal and ended up heading the ball sideways. For all their energy and cohesion, Southampton are missing Danny Ings. Struggling to break into Steven Gerrard’s Villa side, he would surely be starting if he’d stayed at St Mary’s.

2/14/2022,"One card reads “Happy unimaginative consumerist entirely arbitrary manipulative shallow interpretation of romance day”, “Meh” – emblazoned on a pink heart – is the message on another, while an animal charity offers the opportunity to have your ex’s name printed on the bottom of a litter tray. An anti-Valentine’s Day movement is sweeping across the country, and suddenly there are all sorts of ways to mark 14 February that don’t involve hearts or flowers.  “Valentine’s Day is not something that everyone likes to celebrate – it’s very commercialised, everything is about love, love, love,” said Floribeth Pena de Amador, founder of the Happy Book Place, an online gift shop. “I think people are honestly fed up with the day.” Amador recently created “anti-Valentine’s Day” mugs stating that V is for vodka and video games, to capitalise on the trend. “Some Valentine’s Days, you are alone, with a broken heart. And you just want to make yourself happier. So why not buy something for yourself?” On the popular online marketplace Etsy, a wide range of anti-Valentine’s Day cards, T-shirts and stickers are on sale. “I don’t need a Valentine, I need a nap,” one jumper reads. “Ew, Valentine’s Day” and “Cupid rhymes with stupid” both feature, too. While a few of the anti-Valentine’s Day cards celebrate being single most are aimed at couples who eschew stereotypical declarations of love. “I suppose you’ll do” and “I love you because you’re just like me and I am the best” are among the most romantic. Earlier this week, Bristol Animal Rescue Centre began inviting its supporters to donate £5 to have the first name of a person of their choice written on the bottom of a cat litter tray. The charity is filming the cats they have rescued using the trays and will share the “photo or video evidence” on social media each day up until Valentine’s Day. “We’ve had quite a bit of demand so far,” said a spokesperson, Gina Jones. The anti-Valentine’s fundraiser means those who think the tradition is exclusionary or over-commercialised can still do something positive for a charity, Jones said. “If you want to be romantic, that’s lovely. But there are people who don’t really like that.” At one Etsy shop, World Of Twigg, sales of anti-Valentine’s cards have overtaken sales of Valentine’s cards this year. “I’m almost sold out of them now,” said a card designer, Holly Showell. She finds Valentine’s Day “completely pointless”. She said: “I’m in a relationship and I don’t need to buy the person I love loads of stuff on Valentine’s Day. I can just tell him that I love him every day.” It is ironic, she acknowledged, that a card she designed to express her own anti-consumerist feelings towards Valentine’s Day is selling so well. “I designed it because I was fed up with Valentine’s Day. And it’s just become really popular.” At the Royal Vauxhall Tavern in southeast London, 14 February will be celebrated with “hate, venom and gore” at an anti-Valentine’s Day ball. Planned activities include a “crap Valentine’s Day card” competition, a ‘blind date’ gameshow featuring characters from horror movies and a “broken-hearted disco” where attenders can only dance to famous songs about relationship break-ups. “The normal fare on offer on Valentine’s Day is quite cliched and not particularly interesting,” said the promoter, Paul Joseph. “People want to mark the day by doing something that’s reflective of their sentiments towards it.” Tickets to the ball cost £15 and, despite all the uncertainties that surround any event during the pandemic, it is currently on track to sell out. Joseph thinks this is because both couples and single people are rebelling against the idea that they must celebrate Valentine’s Day in a particular way. “I think that irritates people,” he said. Juliet O’Brien, founder of WaxyWix, decided to create her range of “sassy” – and often sweary – anti-Valentine’s Day candles for similar reasons. She dislikes the sense of being obliged to buy roses and go out for dinner because it’s Valentine’s Day. “Prices are hiked up and you feel like you’ve got to celebrate it.” Her candles are designed to appeal to both couples and friends. “One of our candles says: ‘roses are red, chocolates are brown, you’re getting neither so calm the F-word down.’” Valentine’s Day is no longer an Americanised “Hallmark card” type of holiday, she said. “It’s almost like we are reclaiming it, saying: this is how we want to celebrate it.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘It’s very commercialised’: the rise of the anti-Valentine’s Day movement,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/14/its-very-commercialised-the-people-who-dont-buy-in-to-valentines-day
2/14/2022,"Joelle Taylor, the 54-year-old Lancastrian and poetry slam champion, is a fighter on the page. C+nto, the bold, combative and moving winner of the TS Eliot prize, is a passionate reconjuring of 1980s-90s butch lesbian counterculture in London (there used to be dozens of lesbian bars in the city; now there is only one). This is a dramatic narrative that does not reflect any improvement in attitudes towards the LGBTQ+ society; its context is turbulence. In her preface, she declares: “There is no part of a butch lesbian that is welcome in this world” and reminds us that 72 countries still criminalise same-sex relationships and that there are “11 jurisdictions that support the death penalty for lesbians”. She believes the loss of face-to-face encounters in clubs and the divisive nature of the internet have unravelled gay unity and her poetry is a rallying cry to put that right. Once you have heard Taylor recite on YouTube, looking sharp in her tweed suits, her poems on the page seem unattended without her. There is swank, swagger and firecracker protest in her writing and the ideal is to hear her perform. The book’s title is from the now obsolete Italian literary verb cuntare (to recount) and much of it is divided into “rounds” as though in a boxing ring. But the past is also envisaged as a series of vitrines, their stillness in contrast to Taylor’s pounding blood. Nostalgia’s first cousin, it turns out, is rage.  She introduces four characters – composites of real people encountered “on the scene” – all dead now: Dudizile, Valentine, Jack Catch and Angel. Valentine is a stud, “a black masculine presenting lesbian”. The first poem in Valentine’s name is about invisibility, the need to be “where the road cannot reach us”. Like many of the poems, there is a sense in it of the combustible: the story will end in tears or fire. Occasionally, there is a hint of Jeanette Winterson (from a comparable working-class Lancastrian background) to the writing. The reliquary of dead women, one of C+nto’s finest stretches, could be read as a companion piece to Winterson’s novel Written on the Body. With pugilistic grief, Taylor treats each bone as an exhibit: “this femur belonged to the first boi who over-extended her stride… ” and continues: When breath eddies the dust, we are all born again, my pretty Pompei, settling into the shape of a street fighter her petticoats snarling That “snarling” is great – Taylor glories in garb as language. She can be flamboyant yet can also write with efficient economy. A man’s unwelcome attention is succinctly described when he “stubs his kiss out” on a cheek. But there were moments when I felt undecided about C+nto’s intended audience. When you suspect someone is not addressing you directly, it can feel rude to stare (heterosexual readers might feel like wallflowers). At the same time, it could equally be argued that it is this access to her world, this invitation to watch her fight her corner, which makes the book powerful. What I particularly admire is the way Taylor allows undressed lines to surface, such as: “I can’t remember the names of all my dead friends.” And she ends with an extraordinary poem about the names of dead strangers – murdered lesbians across the world. The searing effect of the recitation of names is not new but what Taylor pulls off is a fresh desolation: her poem is register and receptacle.

2/14/2022,"One of the main promises of modern capitalism – of modern life, really – is that you will always be able to buy more and better stuff. It’s not true, of course. Capitalism takes away as well as provides. And for poorer people, or those who are just financially stretched, the constantly advertised pleasures of consumer life often lie tantalisingly out of reach. But for more than half a century, enough people have been able to afford them – or been able to borrow the necessary money – for society to be largely shaped around consumer habits in Britain and other rich countries. City centres, suburban retail parks, huge stretches of the internet and the inside of our heads: all are alive with, and constantly remade by, our acquisitive desires.  The social and environmental costs of this – for the low-paid workers needed to produce and sell cheap goods, for the non-consumerist parts of our lives that get neglected, for the climate – increasingly worry many people. Yet there is little sign that consumerism is receding as a social or political priority. Most British shops may have been made to close, some of the time, during the early phases of the pandemic, but since last spring they have been allowed to stay open regardless of its resurgence. Going to the shops has been seen by government and many citizens as almost as important as public health. So the onset of the cost-of-living crisis, which looks likely to last many months and quite possibly years, is a direct challenge to how many of us live. Already squeezed by a dozen years of falling or stagnant wages, Britain now faces its worst inflation and fuel prices for decades, rising taxes and interest rates, more expensive loans for students and extra import duties thanks to Brexit. To an extent that has yet to be fully appreciated, many people will become significantly poorer: on its own, the recent increase in the household energy price cap of £693, which is expected to be followed by others, represents more than 2% of the average full-time salary. And unlike the last time we faced such a significant threat to our standard of living, in the 1970s and early 1980s, most Britons will not be protected from inflation to some extent by the negotiating leverage on pay of strong trade unions. Instead, we are about to learn what it’s like to live in an inflationary economy dominated by corporate interests, such as the fossil fuel companies, which can profit from the crisis without being required by the government to pay windfall taxes that might soften it for their customers. Some of the consequences of this new economic reality are already with us. Instead of choice, bargains, instant gratification and easy access to European goods – all the modern British shopper’s customary privileges – we are encountering empty shelves, suddenly marked-up prices and shipping delays. The change is all the more difficult to adjust to because it comes after what for many consumers was a golden age. Between the mid-1950s and mid-2000s, despite periodic recessions and government cuts, the average disposable income grew consistently faster than inflation, according to the Resolution Foundation. During the 1990s, the steady improvement in living standards accelerated as a whole new world of cheap consumption opened up in Britain: low-cost supermarkets, budget airlines, factory outlets, bargain fashion and furniture chains. Some of these businesses had traded here before, but never previously on such a scale. Their expansion was partly made possible by moving manufacturing to countries with lower wages. Even shrewd business commentators expected this highly convenient arrangement for western consumers to last a long time. In 2006, the veteran retail analyst Richard Hyman told me: “Our forecasts do not anticipate any major increase in retail price inflation ever again.” Instead, the golden age gradually ended. Wages stopped rising in Britain, and then the Conservatives disempowered poorer consumers further through their austerity policies. For a time, the new pressures on British consumerism were partly hidden by low inflation and more borrowing. Between 1990 and 2019, the amount of unsecured (non-mortgage) debt held by the average household more than trebled. But by the mid-2010s the increasingly tense and angry quality of British politics and everyday life suggested a country where many people were barely coping financially. Last year, the Resolution Foundation said that 2007 to 2022 was expected to be “the worst [period] on record for household income growth”. What sort of society might the cost-of-living crisis produce? One where millions don’t eat or heat their homes as often as they should, according to reports published last week by the Food Foundation and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. For many less vulnerable Britons, the crisis will be less awful. Essentials will still be paid for, but they will absorb more and more of people’s incomes. Even during the golden era for consumers, Britain still had high housing and travel costs – trying to offset those was partly what made us such bargain-hunters. Now the personal financial trade-offs between escapism and realism will be even harder. But probably not for the rich. A week ago, after walking along Oxford Street in London with its abandoned department stores and thinned-out shopping crowds, I went to Harrods in Knightsbridge. Its narrow marble corridors were as clogged as ever with expensively groomed customers. As shopping for pleasure becomes less affordable, it may revert to what it was in past centuries: the elite competing for luxuries. Some people won’t be sad if that happens. Plenty of Britons hate shopping. And the planet needs us to do less of it – or at least, to do it in a more sustainable way, for example by buying secondhand. It’s even possible that the internet, through its constant flood of novel facts and images, is making us less interested in acquiring new material possessions. But digital commodities, from artworks to fashion, are increasingly being offered instead. And the internet also keeps us window shopping and wanting physical goods in ways that did not exist before. Under capitalism, for there to be social and political stability, common expectations about living standards need to be satisfied. It’s no coincidence that British consumerism’s best years were also years of relative political calm – or that populism began to take off here, in the late 2000s, when the rise in wages started to stall. Once people feel life is getting too expensive, they often believe everything is getting worse. If enough people feel like that, governments don’t last long.

2/14/2022,"The commonwealth has reached a “historic” financial settlement with three women who were found to have been sexually harassed by the former high court justice Dyson Heydon after an independent investigation. The attorney general, Michaelia Cash, announced the compensation payout on Monday, along with an apology to the three women who have been negotiating with the commonwealth since the findings of an independent investigation undertaken by Vivienne Thom were released in 2020.  In 2019, three former high court judges’ associates lodged complaints about Heydon’s behaviour, with Thom finding the former high court judge had sexually harassed six complainants. Asssociates Chelsea Tabart, Alexandra Eggerking and Rachael Collins have signed a non-disclosure agreement as part of the settlement, which Cash said reflected the commonwealth taking the claims “very seriously”. Josh Bornstein from Maurice Blackburn, who was representing the women, said he believed the claim was the first time a settlement had been reached for sexual harassment claims under the Sex Discrimination Act arising from findings against a serving federal judge. Speaking on behalf of the associates, Bornstein said the women were relieved the claims had been finalised, and happy with what he described as a “historic” settlement of compensation. “They have asked me to convey their strong conviction that women should not feel ashamed to pursue financial settlements in sexual harassment cases because sexual harassment will only start to recede when there is a clear recognition that it has a substantial cost to organisations and individuals who are implicated,” Bornstein said. “The settlement of these claims is of particular importance because it shows that women can succeed in the quest for truth and accountability in cases of sexual harassment, even involving some of the most powerful individuals and institutions in the land. “It’s not always the case, but sometimes the legal process can overcome a severe power imbalance.” Bornstein said the women’s complaints had led to a “profound effect” on the legal profession and had also prompted others to come forward with allegations, with a number of other investigations under way. “A cultural revolution is under way in the courts, law societies, barristers’ associations and law firms.” Bornstein said the settlement figure reflected the fact that the women had been unable to pursue the legal careers they had aspired to as a result of their harassment, with actuarial material presented as part of the negotiation showing the “loss of a legal career for a typical high court associate.” “Many former high court associates pursue successful careers as barristers and some are then appointed as judges.” In a statement, Cash praised the “bravery” of the women for coming forward. “These women have told us about what they have been through during, and since, their times as associates of the high court and the serious impacts on their lives,” Cash said. “We have listened to them and we apologise.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In response to the Thom inquiry, six recommendations for the high court were accepted and implemented, with Cash saying the court’s practices had been “transformed” as a result. Last year, Heydon issued a statement through his lawyers denying “emphatically any allegation of sexual harassment or any offence”. “In respect of the confidential inquiry and its subsequent confidential report, any allegation of predatory behaviour or breaches of the law is categorically denied by our client,” the statement said. “Our client says that if any conduct of his has caused offence, that result was inadvertent and unintended, and he apologises for any offence caused.“The inquiry was an internal administrative inquiry and was conducted by a public servant and not by a lawyer, judge or a tribunal member. It was conducted without having statutory powers of investigation and of administering affirmations or oaths.”",News/Australia news,‘Historic’ settlement for women allegedly sexually harassed by former high court justice Dyson Heydon,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/14/historic-settlement-for-women-allegedly-sexually-harassed-by-former-high-court-justice-dyson-heydon
