4/29/2022,"Robbie Power, whose big-race victories include the Grand National, the Cheltenham Gold Cup and the Irish Grand National, said on Thursday that he will retire from race-riding after partnering Teahupoo in the Paddy Power Champion Hurdle at Punchestown on Friday. Power landed the Grand National on Silver Birch in 2007 and the Gold Cup aboard Jessica Harrington’s Sizing John a decade later. He has struggled with a series of injuries in recent seasons, however, including a fractured hip which kept him on the sidelines from October until late January during the 2021-22 campaign. “It’s down to the injuries,” Power said after winning a handicap chase on Magic Daze at Punchestown on Thursday. “I’m 41 next month and I’m not getting any younger. I had injections in my hip but it didn’t really work. The whole family are coming tomorrow and I’ve got a couple of good rides left. My wife knew and my agent knew, but my father always told me if you tell one person you’ve told one person too many, so I was trying to keep it as quiet as possible. “There’s been several days I’ve woke up thinking this was it. If I’d won the Gold Cup [on Minella Indo, the runner-up] I’d have gone then, but Punchestown has been lucky for me so to go here, where I rode my first winner and now I’m guaranteed to ride my last one here, that will do.” The first of Power’s 31 Grade One wins before his final rides on Friday came in February 2005 on Carrigeen Victor, also trained by Harrington, while his most recent top-level success was on Colin Tizzard’s Fiddlerontheroof in the Tolworth Hurdle in January 2020. He rode 15 Grade One winners for the Harrington stable, and 11 for Tizzard, including the Betfair Chase in 2019 on Lostintranslation. Power came with a strong late run on Ashdale Bob in Thursday’s feature event, the Champion Stayers Hurdle, but it was not enough to overhaul Klassical Dream, the 11-10 favourite, who held on to win the race for the second year running by one-and-a-quarter lengths. The decision to return Newmarket’s Guineas meeting to three days has not enjoyed the most competitive of starts, with just 42 runners declared for Friday’s card at Headquarters and only 22 in the four contests being shown live on ITV4. That could see punters edging towards a competitive sprint handicap at Goodwood in search of a bet at a working person’s price, and Raasel (2.40), one of the more progressive five-furlong specialists last season, is worth an interest at around 5-1 to register his first win of 2022. It took Mick Appleby three outings and a 201-day midsummer break to work his magic on Raasel after a switch to his yard at the start of 2021, but he then reeled off a five-timer – starting with a win over this track and trip – in the space of six weeks from mid-September. He failed to extend his winning streak to six on his return to action at Musselburgh earlier this month but showed more than enough there to suggest his latest mark of 94 offers room for further progress this summer. Goodwood 1.30: Al Mubhir won with plenty to spare on his debut at Newmarket last October, with three next-time winners among the beaten horses. Newmarket 1.50: Another winner from a hot juvenile event makes his seasonal debut and Subastar looks big at around 4-1 to follow up his comfortable maiden win in September, a race in which the second, third and fourth all won next time up. Newmarket 2.25: Gubbass improved to finish about two-and-a-half lengths behind Perfect Power in the Greenham and could well boost that form before the winner’s run in the 2,000 Guineas on Saturday. Newmarket 3.00: A 5lb penalty may not be enough to stop Wizard D’Amour following up his win in a strong time at Catterick last week. Wolverhampton: 1.00 Weloof, 1.40 Motasaafeq, 2.15 Gherkin, 2.50 City Escape, 3.25 Sweeping Statement, 4.00 Captain Kane, 4.35 Deep Sigh.  Newmarket: 1.15 New Hope Bullet, 1.50 Subastar, 2.25 Gubbass, 3.00 Wizard D’Amour (nb), 3.35 Yibir, 4.10 Voodoo Queen, 4.45 Dingle. Goodwood: 1.30 Al Mubhir, 2.05 Rocket Rodney, 2.40 Raasel (nap), 3.15 Save A Forest, 3.50 Chipstead, 4.25 Wineglass Bay, 5.00 Diamond Cutter. Cheltenham: 4.40 Envoye Special, 5.15 Famous Clermont, 5.50 Moratorium, 6.25 Salvatore, 7.00 Cashmoll, 7.35 Shantou Flyer, 8.10 Stratagem. Newcastle: 5.05 Parikarma, 5.35 Sonnerie Power, 6.10 Harswell Duke, 6.45 Golden Voice, 7.20 King’s Knight, 7.55 Redzone, 8.30 Joshua R. Goodwood 3.15: Save A Forest was disappointing in the Park Hill Stakes on her final start at three but her Listed win at Newmarket on her previous outing looks like strong form and she deserves a chance to regain the winning thread back at that 12-furlong trip. Newmarket 3.35: The Group Two feature event on the card is likely to be a straightforward assignment for Yibir, last year’s Breeders’ Cup Turf winner, if he is anywhere near his best for his first run in Britain since August 2021.",Sport/Sport,Talking Horses: Robbie Power to retire after Punchestown send-off,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/28/talking-horses-robbie-power-to-retire-after-punchestown-send-off
4/29/2022,"The 2022 Venice Art Biennale belies its name. Delayed by the pandemic, it is three rather than two years since the previous edition, which bore the foreboding title May You Live In Interesting Times. The ancient Chinese curse certainly worked. Cecilia Alemani, the New York-based Italian curator of the 59th edition, which opened on Saturday, thus had extra time to prepare her exhibition, which occupies the large central pavilion in the city’s Giardini, as well as the immense spaces of an old rope-making factory in the nearby Arsenale. It shows. Her deep research has produced an unusually coherent show, which, aside from the acreage of new art, also deepens its frame of reference by showing historic work, often by surrealists such as Ithell Colquhoun, Dorothea Tanning and Remedios Varo. Such artists prefigure Ms Alemani’s contemporary preoccupations: the body in transformation, metamorphosis, the world considered from a perspective other than that of the white male. The result is an exhibition 90% created by women, along with some non-binary and transgender artists. This is a corrective to the domination of male artists in the Venice Biennale ever since its foundation in 1895, and it is echoed in the choices by individual countries of artists for national pavilions, with the US, France, the UK, Germany, Poland, Romania, Scotland and many other much-discussed shows all in the hands of women. If there were an overall mood or spirit here, it would be one of cooperation and friendship: rare are the artists who have valorised working in romantic, stoical isolation. Alberta Whittle, representing Scotland, talks of her “accomplices”, from dancers to historians, who have collaborated with her to make her film; Roma artist Małgorzata Mirga-Tas, who occupies the Polish pavilion, has stitched extraordinary patchwork “frescoes” with the help of female fellow sewers; Golden Lion winner Sonia Boyce has pushed herself to the background in order to showcase the talents of black female vocalists and composers in her pavilion for Britain. Another consequence of the pandemic on Ms Alemani’s exhibition, perhaps an unconscious one, is its sensuousness. That is despite the fact that it was mainly researched behind a screen, with the accustomed studio visits occurring virtually. The exhibition is full of sculptures that beg to be viewed from every angle and admired in all their physicality, their texturedness, their suggestion of touch. Even the film and video works tend to have a material feel, sometimes because of the setting in which they are shown, such as P. Staff’s overwhelming kaleidoscope of colours set in a mirrored room, in which the frequent violence of the content is belied by the beauty of the distorted images. An earth maze by Colombian artist Delcy Morelos might at first call to mind the post-minimalist Earth Room by American sculptor Walter de Maria – except that she has added tobacco, cocoa, cloves and other spices to the soil, such that the experience is seductively olfactory. This is art that is to be experienced “with the fullness of the body”, Ms Alemani told the Guardian last week. After two years of physical deracination, from each other as well as from art, it is exactly what feels needed now.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the Venice Biennale: sensuous and serious | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/28/the-guardian-view-on-the-venice-biennale-sensuous-and-serious
4/29/2022,"Around 1.3 million adults have become inactive since the height of Covid, with at least 12 million having less than an average of 30 minutes’ exercise a week, as levels only just begin to recover towards pre-pandemic levels. The Active Lives Adult Survey, which is the largest in England and has 175,000 respondents, tracked adults’ activity for a year from November 2020, with the data taking into account the impact lockdowns had on activity levels. Just over 60% of adults (28 million) were active, achieving more than 150 minutes of activity a week, while 27%, or 12.4 million adults, were inactive, with less than 30 minutes of activity a week. A further 11.5%, or 5.2 million adults, were fairly active but did not reach an average of 150 minutes a week. The data also showed that while activity levels dropped during periods of lockdown restrictions, since coronavirus became less prevalent and restrictions were eased activity levels had begun to stabilise and were now recovering. In mid-March 2021, 61% of the population were active, compared with 58% 12 months earlier. Although these activity levels are now recovering from the impact of the pandemic, activity levels are still lower than beforehand, as there are 600,000 (1.9%) fewer active adults and 1.3 million (2.6%) more inactive adults than before lockdown restrictions. However, demographic variables affected the activity levels of adults across England – 63% of men were active during this period, compared with 60% of women. Furthermore, within different socio-economic groups those who had been unemployed long-term or had never worked were the least likely to be active, at 52%. The data also showed that minority ethnic groups, disabled people and those with long-term health conditions were still less likely to be active, with the pandemic exacerbating these inequalities. Regarding the types of activities that showed growth before the pandemic, only walking for leisure has continued to rise. By contrast, active travel, which means walking or cycling to a specific place, has seen a large drop. Cycling for leisure and sport, as well as running, also fell after restrictions were eased in March 2021, as did swimming. Nigel Huddleston, a minister for sports, said he was encouraged by the survey results but that there was more to be done to tackle inactivity. “I urge everyone to follow the medical advice and do 60 minutes of exercise a day for children and 150 minutes of exercise per week for adults.” Tim Hollingsworth, the chief executive of Sport England, said the fact that activity levels were beginning to recover was “testament to the dedication of all of those who worked so hard to bring activities back safely when restrictions started to be eased.” He added: “Though this report clearly sets out the many challenges that lie ahead in supporting people to play more sport and lead more active lives, the key investments and resources we were able to provide during the harshest of restrictions also played an important role in helping sports get back on their feet.“That the data tells us that this initial recovery is not universal is not a surprise and that is exactly why our Uniting the Movement strategy focuses resources and funding disproportionally towards the people and places that need the most support to be active.”",News/Society,Number of inactive adults in England rises by 1.3m since Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/28/number-of-inactive-adults-in-england-rises-by-more-than-1m-since-covid-peak
4/29/2022,"Furloughed and fed up during the first lockdown, Jason Williams decided to have a go at gardening. His gateway plant was a French marigold, bought from B&Q, and he spent the following months making YouTube videos as he learned what thrives on an 18th floor balcony in central Manchester. Unlike the rest of us who picked up a trowel for the first time during the pandemic, Williams’ lockdown “cloud garden” was such a success that he has been invited to recreate it for this year’s Chelsea flower show. The 35-year-old bar manager will be making his Chelsea debut in the show’s “small space gardening” section, which was introduced last year as a response to the boom in balcony and container horticulture. Describing his gardening style as “perfectly imperfect”, Williams has built up a dedicated online following for his candid videos. Starring as the Cloud Gardener (Cloudy to his fans), he is sometimes dressed in a kimono teamed with what appears to be a silken shower cap, occasionally weeping with joy or despair. He gives as much airtime to his failures as his successes, paying tender homage to the plants he has inadvertently killed (though he prefers the term “unalived”). The sunflowers were a flop (“the leaves are too big and they suffer really harshly from windburn, so I unalived them”), but the passionfruit and grapes are going great guns. One day he dreams of harvesting enough to make wine. He’s learned a lot about gardening at height, where the winds from the Lancashire plain can rip the head off a delicate rose but temperatures can sometimes be a whole 10C higher than on ground level. And who knew that bumblebees can reach the 18th floor? Williams prides himself on his honesty, speaking out about his anxiety and depression, and when things go awry. “On social media, there is this urge to make everything perfect and so everything has to be filtered. But all throughout my content there’s absolutely no filtering, there’s no colour adjustments,” he said. “I purposely will show everybody my dead plants because I think it’s really important so that people understand that gardening is challenging.” When he applied for Chelsea he stressed that he wanted his show garden to be accessible “to show what can be done in a realistic way”. His target audience is “people who would never even think about Chelsea”. All of the plants in his Chelsea garden are those he has tried and tested on his Mancunian balcony, and which can be easily bought in a bog-standard garden centre. “What I didn’t want to do is create some show garden masterpiece that people cannot replicate. Or if they did, they would fail and be like, ‘Ah, I don’t have the green thumb’, and stop,” he said. He wants to challenge the idea that black people don’t garden. “We do. You just don’t tend to see it on TV.” There’s Danny Clarke, the Black Gardener, he said, and Tayshan Hayden-Smith, a footballer who now appears on Your Garden Made Perfect. “But there’s not much representation for young black males especially,” said Williams. “I’m hoping that there’ll be some young gardeners and some budding young designers out there, who will see me and it might give them the belief that they can actually appear at Chelsea too. I mean, I have no gardening or landscaping experience whatsoever. So if I can make it, then so can they.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,From the 18th floor to Chelsea: ‘Cloud Gardener’ to exhibit at flower show,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/28/from-the-18th-floor-to-chelsea-cloud-gardener-to-exhibit-at-flower-show
4/29/2022,"It wasn’t the best of adverts for parliament. Every few years or so, MPs let out a collective howl of outrage and decide that something really must be done about sexual misconduct in Westminster. And every few years or so almost nothing substantially changes. Not so long ago it was pornography found on Damian Green’s Commons computer. Now another as-yet unnamed Tory MP has upped the ante by watching pornography on his phone in the Commons’ chamber. Give it a few more years and some sexually incontinent MP will be masturbating live on Parliament TV. That was far from the end of it, though. There was also a shadow cabinet minister accused of making sexually inappropriate remarks about a female Welsh MP. Not to mention the 56 other MPs, including three cabinet members, who are now under investigation for sexual harassment. It makes you wonder how some male MPs ever find time to do any work. So it was Ben Wallace’s bad luck that he was the minister given the short straw of explaining all this on the morning media round. The defence secretary did not cover himself in glory. A simple “This is unacceptable,” and “All women should be treated with respect,” would have done. Instead he chose to play the “long hours, hard-working, late bars” card. As if that was somehow an excuse and any man who worked late and then went to the pub couldn’t help but revert to a naturally sexist self. Clearly some MPs must congratulate themselves for getting through the day without sexually harassing anyone. All things considered, then, the prorogation of parliament probably couldn’t come a moment too soon. A chance to wipe both hard drives and the green benches. Hazmat suits all round. But before the Commons rose for 12 days until the state opening on 10 May, there was still a handful of MPs actually trying to do some work. Labour’s Thangam Debbonaire was trying to secure a correction for one of the lies that Boris Johnson had told during prime minister’s questions. Good luck with that. Conservative Peter Bottomley was waiting in vain for Nadine Dorries to make a statement on the privatisation of Channel 4. Like the Convict, the culture secretary is notoriously reluctant to make herself accountable to her peers. Along the committee corridor, though, history was being made. Almost invariably, James Cleverly is the stupidest person in any room he enters. It’s a massive failure of nominative determinism. But just this once, Jimmy Dimly got an even break. At the meeting of the European scrutiny committee, he got the opportunity to feel what it must be like to be a towering intellect. It just pays to keep the right company. Step forward committee chair Bill Cash, Tory MPs Richard Drax, David Jones, Greg Smith and Anne Marie Morris and the near-silent suspended SNP MP Margaret Ferrier. Names that Cleverly will treasure as long as he lives. The subject, inevitably, was the Northern Ireland protocol. Something that every Tory Brexiter now goes out of their way to distance themselves from, having greeted its arrival as a triumph. There again, even David Frost has no idea these days that David Frost negotiated the protocol. Scarcely a week passes without him writing in the Telegraph about what a hopeless shitshow it is. Lord Frost is in for a hell of a shock when he eventually meets himself. Cash got things going with a general diatribe that Dimly, in his Foreign Office role, should make sure he carried on meeting Brits as well as Europeans, before Drax and Jones moved on to the Northern Ireland Heart of Darkness. Was the minister aware of just how evil the protocol was and that the EU must have hypnotised the UK negotiators into agreeing to it? Did the Americans know just how damaging the protocol was to the NI peace process? New EU directives made NI less and less aligned with the rest of Britain. It was all dreadful. We needed to trigger article 16 before the Apocalypse. “Hmm,” muttered Jimmy D. He wasn’t quite sure how to break it to this coven of halfwits. The problem was ours not the EU’s. They didn’t force us to sign anything. If we were up shit creek it was entirely of our doing. In the end, he decided it was best to say nothing. Why get into dangerous territory and admit on the record that he and the government were out of their depth and The Convict had lied to the country to get Brexit done. So he just said it was all on a need to know basis – Cash and co definitely had no need to know – and he’d maybe update them some time in the next parliament. Down at the Eurotunnel control centre, Jacob Rees-Mogg was also struggling to come to terms with the realities of Brexit. Just as the Northern Ireland protocol was slowly separating NI from the rest of the UK, so the new trade agreement with the EU would cost the UK a fortune in checks and tariffs. So the minister for Brexit opportunities was there to tell the nation that the opportunity he had identified was that Brexit was prohibitively expensive and would put thousands of companies out of business if properly implemented. Which he wasn’t going to do. He was going to delay it for a fourth time. So we would continue to take any foods from the EU unchecked. Viva Brexit. Viva sovereignty.",News/Politics,Is there no end to Tory MPs’ sexual misconduct? |John Crace,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/28/is-there-no-end-to-tory-mps-sexual-misconduct
4/29/2022,"Spain have been kicked out of the 2023 Rugby World Cup and will be replaced by Romania after it was determined that Los Leones fielded an ineligible player, allegedly with the help of a forged passport, in qualifying. Spain had reached the World Cup for the first time since 1999 after a dramatic win over Portugal in March but have been docked 10 points and dumped out of next year’s tournament in France. An independent disciplinary panel appointed by World Rugby found that the South Africa-born prop Gavin van den Berg appeared for Spain in two matches, against the Netherlands in 2021 and 2022, without having qualified on residency grounds. The panel ruled that Spain should be docked five points a match and fined £25,000, paving the way for Romania to reach the World Cup and Portugal to advance to November’s repechage qualification tournament. It is the second consecutive World Cup cycle that has been dogged by problems over ineligible players with Spain also caught up in the controversy surrounding the 2019 tournament. Then, Romania, Spain and Belgium were all found guilty, leading to Russia reaching the World Cup. At the time Spain were given a £50,000 suspended fine which they are now liable for. Romania join South Africa, Ireland, Scotland and most likely Tonga in pool B at France 2023 with Portugal entering the four-team final qualification tournament. Romania declared “justice is done” after learning of the decision while the Spanish federation, which has the right to appeal against the outcome, described the verdict as “very harsh” before admitting that it came “as a result of an alleged forgery of the aforementioned player’s passport”. It is believed that part of the issue centres around how Van den Berg split his time between Spain and South Africa, an issue made more complicated by travel restrictions due to the pandemic. A statement from the Spanish federation said: “As this very harsh sanction occurs as a result of an alleged forgery of the aforementioned player’s passport, the Spanish Rugby Federation continues with the extraordinary disciplinary procedure initiated at the time.” Meanwhile, in a double fitness boost for Eddie Jones before England’s summer tour of Australia, Courtney Lawes and Tom Curry – both of whom captained the side during the Six Nations – are set to return from injury this weekend. Lawes was described as “Frankenstein’s monster” by Northampton earlier this week because of the gruesome nature of his dislocated thumb but whereas it was feared he may not feature again this season, he comes straight into Saints’ starting lineup against Harlequins on Friday night. Curry sustained a hamstring injury in England’s defeat by Ireland in March but is set for a comeback off the bench in Sale’s clash with Newcastle.",Sport/Sport,Spain kicked out of 2023 Rugby World Cup after alleged passport fraud,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/28/spain-kicked-out-of-2023-rugby-world-cup-after-alleged-passport-fraud
4/29/2022,"Experienced Tory MPs with a “neutral” attitude to Boris Johnson are being sought to sit on the committee judging whether he misled parliament over Partygate, following concerns that its current membership is too aligned to the government. Johnson is facing an investigation by the privileges committee into whether he lied to the Commons when he said he did not know about any parties in Downing Street during lockdown. It was thought the current membership of seven – four Tories, two Labour, and one SNP MP – would conduct the investigation. However, two of the Tories are government aides and the Labour chair, Chris Bryant, has recused himself from the investigation for having already said he thought Johnson should quit. With huge pressure on the MPs conducting the inquiry, the Tories have accepted that the inquiry needs to be undertaken by parliamentarians who are not on the government payroll, and are experienced enough not to be seeking preferment from No 10. Parliamentary rules state that ministerial aides should not be allowed to sit on committees, but this has been ignored in recent years. Some of the senior Tories being mooted include former attorney general Sir Geoffrey Cox, former justice secretary Sir Robert Buckland, who was previously a member of the committee, former culture secretary Maria Miller and Jeremy Wright, another former attorney general. From Labour, Harriet Harman, the former deputy leader, is believed to have been tapped up. Sir Bernard Jenkin, a current senior member of the committee, may stay on the body. However, Laura Farris and Alberto Costa, two government aides, will be dropped. However, Tory MPs in particular are proving reluctant to sit on the committee given the sensitivity and impact of their decision, which could lead to Johnson’s resignation if he is found to have knowingly misled the House of Commons. There is also an issue with finding candidates to sit on the committee who have not expressed a view on the prime minister’s conduct over Partygate. Wright, for example, has publicly given his opinion that Johnson should go if he knowingly broke the law and therefore misled the Commons, as well as saying more recently that he can “see how a single mistake can be forgiven, even when it is made by a prime minister”. The privileges committee will have a Conservative majority with candidates picked by the party’s authorities. However, the membership will have to be approved by the House of Commons, so the chosen MPs will need to command the confidence of a wide range of Tory backbenchers – including the prime minister’s critics. One source with knowledge of the process said Tory MPs were trying to dodge the job of having to sit in judgment over the prime minister, knowing it to be a “poisoned chalice”. The committee will not begin examining evidence against Johnson until both the conclusion of the Metropolitan police’s inquiries into lockdown breaking in Number 10 and Whitehall – which have already yielded one fine for the prime minister – and a Whitehall report by the civil servant Sue Gray, which will be published after the Met’s case is closed. Some Conservatives have expressed scepticism that the committee is likely to report before the autumn or even before the end of the year – given the length of time for the Met to finish its investigation. Bryant told the BBC he believed Johnson would be forced to quit by the end of May, but Number 10 has said he has no intention of resigning if he receives more fines from the Met or if he is criticised in Gray’s report. In an exchange with Keir Starmer in January, the prime minister has acknowledged it is precedent for ministers to resign if they are found to have misled parliament.",News/Politics,‘Poisoned chalice’: senior Tories sought for place on committee judging PM,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/28/boris-johnson-partygate-senior-tories-privileges-committee
4/29/2022,"The Snapchat founder, Evan Spiegel, has dismissed Facebook’s “metaverse” ambitions as “ambiguous and hypothetical” as he announced a raft of new augmented reality features coming to phones and Snap’s experimental AR Spectacles over the next year. Speaking ahead of the Snap Partner Summit, the company’s flagship annual event, Spiegel argued Snapchat was uniquely placed to guide the next decade of technology thanks to the company’s vast array of augmented reality services, such as the “lenses” that are used by millions of people every day. With 332 million daily users and a market cap of $46.95bn (£38bn), Snap is comfortably larger than Twitter, even after the acquisition offer for the latter from Elon Musk, but gets a fraction of the attention. “That’s something that sort of comes along with them being the ‘public town square’,” Spiegel says. “We’re happy with the value that we provide to our community – and society.” He cites statistics that “over 90% of Snapchatters say they feel comfortable, happy, and connected when they use Snapchat”, which is “ranked the No 1 happiest platform when compared to other apps”. “There’s now like 250 million people engaging with AR everyday on the smartphone alone,” Spiegel said. “And that’s on this tiny little screen that you’re looking through and you’re using your thumbs on. So we believe that trying to break some of those constraints, and go into a truly immersive and interactive AR experience, will be really important in the future.” Snap’s latest Spectacles have only shipped in prototype form to creators around the world: with a 15- to 30-minute battery life and a severely restricted display, they are intended to inspire creators with the possibility of future versions of the same hardware. But, Spiegel says, the next generation is already in development. “It just changes the way you interact when you can walk around and use your hands, and see computing brought to life. The strength of our AR glasses is the AR platform behind it, met with hundreds of hundreds of thousands of developers, millions of lenses, and really, really advanced tools that continue to evolve rapidly.” Core to that evolution is an update called Lens Cloud that lets developers for both Snapchat and Spectacles build AR experiences that are firmly placed in the real world. One set of tools lets Lenses be anchored to any location around the world: Lego has used it to build virtual ferris wheels, rollercoasters and slides around the streets of central London. Another feature lets two users of the same AR lens interact with each other for the first time, occupying the same virtual spaces and playing the same games. The updates sound like they could be the foundations of a shared virtual universe of the type that Facebook recently decided was so fundamental to its future that it even rebranded the company as Meta. But, Spiegel says, the word “metaverse” is never uttered in Snap’s offices. “The reason why we don’t use that word is because it’s pretty ambiguous and hypothetical. Just ask a room of people how to define it, and everyone’s definition is totally different. “But one of the big overarching concepts people have is that a lot of those tools are designed to replace reality. Whereas when we talk about AR, we’re trying to augment the real world around you. So our fundamental bet is that people actually love the real world: they want to be together in person with their friends. “And, of course, our vision is real today, with glasses that you can use today, and a platform that works at scale today. So we try to stay away from those hypotheticals, because we’re focused on what we’re building right now.” Spiegel also revealed Pixy, “the world’s friendliest flying camera” – a palm-sized autonomous drone that can be used to capture outdoor activities. With a single button to control it, users just hold Pixy in their hand and select one of five modes, including “follow” – the drone will recognise and follow its owner taking video on the way – and “reveal” – the drone will fly to its maximum altitude and film the reverse pan as it goes. “Everything you need to capture the spontaneity and fun of the moment from new perspectives is right in the palm of your hand,” Spiegel said. “There are no controllers. There’s no complex set-up. Simply select a flight path and let Pixy take it from there, floating above you as it captures photos and videos. And it knows when and where to return, landing gently in the palm of your hand.” The device is available for purchase from Thursday for $229.99 to customers in the US and France.",News/Technology,Snapchat’s Evan Spiegel dismisses Facebook’s metaverse as ‘hypothetical’,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/28/snapchat-evan-spiegel-dismisses-facebook-metaverse-hypothetical
4/29/2022,"A vast blanket of foul-smelling toxic foam has overflowed a polluted river near the Colombian capital Bogotá, covering homes and business, and sending residents fleeing from cloud-like fragments as they drift through the streets. “The smell is terrible – [and] we’ve had to put up with this foam for a long time,” community leader Luz Mariela Gómez told local television channels. “We’re running a risk. Someone could fall down there and we won’t be able to find them.” Photographs from the residential suburb Mosquera showed immense drifts of pungent foam burying pavements and towering over residents. One road to a school was blocked. Local environmental authorities said that the polluted foam - which has been seen in the town several times over the past few years – is increasing because of people dumping waste, chemicals and detergents into the river system. Heavy rains have added to the problem. The Mosquera mayor’s office tweeted photos of the toxic foam, alongside town officials. The mayor, Gian Gerometta, claimed that the buildup of pollution was partly due to a blockage caused by plants in the river. “We are aware of the risks that can arise due to this phenomenon,” he tweeted . Authorities also warned locals against getting too close to the foam, which is thought to cause respiratory problems and skin irritations. “It is important that children are kept away as we do not yet totally know what this material is,” Edwin García, a government environmental official, told local radio station Caracol, adding that a treatment plant in the region has been working to decontaminate the river since 2020. “We will be monitoring and cleaning the entire river to prevent foam from continuing to accumulate.”",News/World news,‘The smell is terrible’: toxic foam clouds float through streets of Bogotá suburb,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/28/colombia-toxic-foam-clouds-polluted-river-bogota
4/29/2022,"Until this week, the government repeatedly rejected the notion of a windfall tax on oil and gas companies, which have been reaping huge profits from sky-high energy prices. But the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, hinted at a possible U-turn on Wednesday, telling Mumsnet that such a policy was “never off the table”, and would be looked at if investment by companies in Britain’s energy security failed to materialise. The idea is that the money raised could be spent on easing the cost of living crisis for those households most under pressure from soaring prices. So what would a windfall tax on oil and gas companies be worth to the Treasury? Labour has repeatedly argued that a one-off, year-long windfall levy could raise £1.2bn to fund discounts on home energy bills, which are already at a record high of £1,971 for an average dual-fuel tariff, with a further eye-watering rise on the way in October. The party has proposed levying an extra 10% on the corporation tax paid by oil companies that are active in the North Sea. This would be on top of the 19% rate they pay on their profits. This would not only affect well-known firms such as BP and Shell but also lesser-known ones such as Harbour Energy – which actually produces more oil from the North Sea than any other extractor: about 163,000 barrels last year. The sector’s big firms have certainly done extremely well out of the high oil and gas prices that have sent energy bills and the cost of filling up a car to record highs. BP made a profit of £10bn last year, admitting it has “more cash than we know what to do with”. The company was a “cash machine”, its chief executive, Bernard Looney, said – around the same time as dismissing calls for a windfall tax. Shell did even better at £15bn, after record quarterly earnings in the last three months of 2021. Both companies will report first-quarter figures next week, including any boost connected to the war in Ukraine. On Wednesday, Sunak appeared to leave the door ajar for a levy – but one that would penalise those oil firms that fail to do their best to help the UK squeeze more drops out of the North Sea. “What I would say is that if we don’t see that type of investment coming forward and companies are not going to make those investments in our country and energy security, then of course that’s something I would look at and nothing is ever off the table in these things,” he said. It is not immediately clear how the government would set the criteria for judging which companies are underinvesting. In practice, forecasts of increased investment in the North Sea suggest very few firms, if any, are likely to be penalised under current circumstances. Spending in the North Sea is forecast to hit £21bn over the next five years, according to a report published last September by the UK oil trade body Offshore Energies UK, a higher annual rate than the £3.7bn of investment in 2020. Habour Energy, which produces a fraction of either BP or Shell’s global output, increased its spending on new and existing projects from $556m to $640m last year. It plans to increase its spending further this year, indicating it would be unlikely to fall foul of any penalty for perceived underinvestment. Shell is already considering a U-turn on its decision to abandon the Cambo oilfield, which lies about 75 miles north-west of the Shetland Islands. The company said this month it planned to invest £20bn-£25bn in the UK energy system over the next decade, although 75% will be on offshore wind, hydrogen and electric vehicle infrastructure, rather than North Sea oilfields. But it too is planning more extraction. “We plan to continue to invest in the North Sea,” BP said in its latest annual report.",News/Business,How would a UK windfall tax on oil and gas profits work?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/28/how-would-a-uk-windfall-tax-on-oil-and-gas-profits-work
4/29/2022,"Can nobody push Liz Truss back into her cage? In her “British war aims” speech at Mansion House, proposing to drive Russia back to its pre-2014 borders, she simply echoed Vladimir Putin’s sick dream of recreating a mythic imperial past (Putin threatens Ukraine allies as Truss urges ‘doubling down’ on support for Kyiv, 27 April). But this is not 1945. The Ukraine war is not going to end with Russia’s unconditional surrender – the only terms on which Russia would leave Crimea. It will probably end in messy stalemate, followed by murky diplomacy. Crimea, casually transferred from Russia to Ukraine on a dictator’s whim in 1954, remained overwhelmingly Russian in sentiment even before the rigged referendum of 2014. The Donbas may have to be partitioned under UN auspices (to the inevitable fury of both communities), as Upper Silesia was partitioned by the League of Nations in 1921. Truss’s insistence on restoring previous “territorial integrity” boundaries to states that the UK supports – Georgia or Ukraine – is to license a bloodbath if Georgia invaded “lost” Abkhazia, or mass resistance if Ukraine tried to suppress Russian identities in Crimea.Neal AschersonLondon  Dan Sabbagh’s nuanced and sober analysis of the Ukraine conflict (27 April) focuses on the expansive nature of the rhetoric used by both parties. The absurd Russian claims of “denazifying” Ukraine have been rightly ridiculed, but grandiose statements by western leaders, indicating that we now seek a strategic defeat of Russia, only help the Russian narrative that this is an existential war of national survival for them. Instead, our leaders might do better to adopt the “talk softly and carry a big stick” approach; after all, brave words will not stop a single Russian tank, but a timely and sotto voce delivery of anti-tank weapons might. That will require a degree of message discipline not seen so far: Liz Truss speculating about a decade of war and James Heappey musing on Ukrainian targeting inside Russia do not help to control the narrative. Putin will get the message that aggression won’t work, but declaring that we intend to rub his face in it, especially as the war is still very active and he is not yet defeated, is naive and dangerous; he needs a ladder to climb down. Better to stick rigorously to the line that we are supporting Ukraine to defend itself.Simon Diggins (Retired colonel)Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire  Liz Truss ignored the peace role of the UN and the current efforts of its secretary-general in her Mansion House speech. She offers instead the prospect of more war and dangerous escalation. Britain, as a security council member, shares the “primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security” (article 24 of the UN charter). The huge majority of UN members who condemned Russian aggression in the general assembly on 2 March want the war to stop, not to continue, and that should be the focus of British diplomacy.John GittingsAuthor, The Glorious Art of Peace  It seems that Liz Truss is pushing her leadership bid without a care for what the consequences might be for the country she seeks to lead. The provision of weapons is the right thing to do, but there is a special kind of foolishness in saying exactly what is being provided. Silence from Ms Truss would be welcome, and perhaps show that she is worthy of the office to which she aspires.Dr Roger SlackWistaston, Cheshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

4/29/2022,"The UK government has become a shareholder in a cannabis oil company, a yoghurt bar business, a London-based craft brewery and a maker of land, underwater and air drones that “take inspiration from the clever tricks that animals use to move”. The taxpayer-backed British Business Bank’s Future Fund, set up by the government to provide loans to startups during the pandemic, announced investments in another 75 companies on Thursday including a stake in a yacht charter business, a virtual reality games developer and a cancer treatment firm. The fund, originally pitched as a way for the government to support innovative companies that may have struggled to secure money during the pandemic, now has an equity stake in 335 businesses. The latest round of investments include Grass & Co – the maker of cannabidiol (CBD) products using chemicals found in hemp, founded by brothers Ben and Tom Grass in 2019 – which is stocked in stores including Selfridges and Boots. Other new investments revealed by the fund include Nordic yoghurt bar maker Yaar, manless-drone company Animal Dynamics, yacht charter firm Borrow a Boat, London-based cancer treatment business Epsilogen, Gipsy Hill Brewing company and virtual games maker nDreams. “The Future Fund was created to increase the flow of capital to companies at the height of the pandemic, while ensuring long-term value for the UK taxpayer,” said Ken Cooper, managing director of venture solutions at British Business Bank. “We’re delighted to see this flow of companies going on to raise further private sector capital. As a shareholder in these businesses, the Future Fund is well positioned to share in the benefits of continued growth.” In total, the government has spent about £1.14bn supporting 1,190 companies through the Future Fund. Of those, 335 have had their loans converted into equity stakes after successfully raising money from private investment that at least matched government funding. On Wednesday, The Times reported that at least 34 companies that have benefited from funding are in the process of being liquidated at a potential cost of £40m of taxpayer money. The government has previously revealed investments in companies including football club Bolton Wanderers, a kombucha drinks maker, a bespoke shipbuilder and a knitting and crochet supplier. While taxpayers now hold stakes in companies such as Vaccitech, a co-inventor of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, and Ripple Energy, which allows customers to take shares in a windfarm, the government has also been criticised for some of its investment decisions. Many in the arts and entertainment industry decried the £1m investment in Secret Cinema, which has held immersive film events themed on Star Wars, Blade Runner, Back to the Future, Dirty Dancing and Stranger Things, while so many other businesses in the sector missed out on financial support through the pandemic.",News/UK news,UK government fund invests in cannabis oil company and London microbrewery,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/28/uk-government-fund-invests-in-cannabis-oil-company-and-london-microbrewery
4/29/2022,"Katharine Birbalsingh’s remark that “physics isn’t something that girls tend to fancy” (Girls shun physics A-level as they dislike ‘hard maths’, says social mobility head, 27 April) sidesteps the crucial question of why girls become so turned off from physics and other Stem subjects (science, technology, engineering and maths). As she observes, the gender disparity in Stem subjects seems to arise in large part from the educational and career choices that girls make – but in what environments are these choices made? At a population level, more girls and women than boys and men tend to combine quantitative skills with social cognitive skills, and therefore have broad leeway to choose subjects and occupations that emphasise one or the other or both. If Stem classrooms and workplaces are allowed to be “boys’ clubs” whose atmospheres are not fully reflective or supportive of girls and women, then girls and women will continue to take their skills elsewhere. Even as we facilitate individual choice, therefore, we must work to make Stem classrooms welcoming places for all, so that these choices are unconstrained.Matthew BelmonteReader in psychology, Nottingham Trent University  I was incensed by Katharine Birbalsingh’s comments. In 1975, I chose physics, maths, chemistry and biology for A-levels. The groups were about a third female. Both our physics and chemistry teachers were female. My daughter, now a doctor, chose sciences, including physics, for all her A-level subjects. I went to a comprehensive school and we were encouraged to do subjects we enjoyed. I am glad we did not have teachers telling us that, because we were female, we would not choose physics or maths because they were too hard. Presumably Birbalsingh also discourages girls from doing too much reading as this might cause their brains to melt and dribble out through their ears.Ruth RisingThornton Watlass, North Yorkshire  So Katharine Birbalsingh thinks that the low proportion of girls in her A-level physics classes (16%) is because girls don’t like doing “hard maths”.

4/29/2022,"Just as Britain has positioned itself as the most munificent provider of weaponry to Ukraine, so it has adopted the most uncompromising of approaches to the terms for a final peace settlement with Russia. Judging by the near existential tone of the foreign secretary Liz Truss’s speech on Wednesday evening, the UK is self-consciously now on the provisional wing of the small group of allies that are privately discussing the terms of how the war might end. Not all of it is in the public domain, but in her speech Truss made clear that Russia would be required to leave the whole of Ukraine, and so no longer retain its foothold in the Donbas in the east and Crimea, which it annexed in 2014. In this view she gained the support of the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, on Thursday. She also agrees with the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, that Russia must end the war so weakened militarily that it cannot repeat its threats not only to Ukraine but to Moldova and the Balkans. For good measure there would have to be reparations – a payment to Ukraine for the damage Moscow had inflicted – in an echo of the principles followed by allied forces against Germany in 1919: punishment, payment and prevention. These terms may not end up as humiliating as the notorious Versailles peace treaty of that year, but they would leave little room for doubt that Putin had lost. The UK has long said that not only must Putin fail in his war, he must also be seen to fail. Discussions on how to define failure in any peace settlement are at an early stage in the cell of diplomats from “the Quad” – the US, UK, France and Germany – discussing the issue. The discussions will evolve as the battlefield evolves. But it is possible that some of what Truss is canvassing is no more than an attempt to counterbalance what the UK fears will be the German or French proclivity to slip back into old dialogue patterns with Moscow. It may also be that Truss sees little political downside in being the coldest of cold war warriors inside the cabinet. But it is not all political calculation. The British position also stems from a thoroughgoing analysis set out in the speech of what it sees as being at stake in Ukraine, and how this must lead to a new security order in which Russia is marginalised. Truss sees this as a moment when the age of authoritarians ends, and in this sense Ukraine is fighting not just for its homeland but for the security of the west. By the same token, the speech was peppered with warnings to China that access to western markets is conditional. She also sent a message to Berlin, telling them the Wandel durch Handel – the assumption that economic integration and trade can drive political change – had been proven false. In dismissing this tenet she not only rejected the Ostpolitik of Germany’s Social Democrats, but also the assumptions of successive German chancellors. Trading with Russia did not lure Moscow towards democracy, she said. Instead, Putin “took the money from oil and gas and used it to consolidate power and gain leverage abroad”. It is mildly ironic that the German politician with whom Truss allies herself most in saying this is the Green foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock – not her natural political soul sister. But wars create novel alliances. Truss argues that this new approach melds hard security and economic security. Just as China should never have been given access to UK infrastructure or its telecoms network, so Germany should not have handed its ability to keep the lights on to Gazprom. Critics of Truss will say her rhetoric, including the promise to keep arming Ukraine, serves only to inflame Moscow and risks dangerous escalation. The UK’s endorsement of Ukraine using its weapons to hit targets inside Russia, for instance, makes it more likely that Moscow will regard Nato forces outside Ukraine or Nato trainers inside Ukraine as proxies and legitimate targets. It encourages Putin’s growing tendency to present his “special military operation” not as a limited liberation of the Donbas, but as a systemic struggle with Nato in which Ukraine merely becomes the first military battlefield. Truss seemed prepared to answer that critique on Wednesday when she described the British as “risk takers” with a history of standing up to bullies. Her allies point out that Putin has previously threatened but not carried through on a nuclear response to the crossing of Russia’s red lines. She also seems optimistic that China ultimately will draw back from supporting Putin since it will not want to be on the losing side. India, too, if given modern western arms rather than old Soviet weapons, could end its hedging. With heavier weapons being delivered at a faster rate, Truss no longer thinks the war will last as long as five years – a view she held privately some months back. Yet that optimism does not reduce the risk in her calculus. In her speech Truss portrayed Putin as unpredictable and therefore qualitatively different from Soviet leaders for whom international reputation mattered, and with whom at least the Cuban missile crisis could be averted. But if Putin is the rogue Truss describes, and feels the only peace terms on offer are humiliation, he has little motive to sue for peace. If cornered, he may make good his threat to escalate by using nuclear weapons or lightning strikes on his true adversary, Nato. The more the stakes are raised, the more there is to lose. As the French prime minister Georges Clemenceau remarked in the context of 1918, sometimes “it is easier to make war than peace”.",News/Politics,Risk-taker Truss adopts tough line on terms for Russia peace deal,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/28/risk-taker-truss-adopts-tough-line-on-terms-for-russia-peace-deal
4/29/2022,"The man sported a stripy Marks & Spencer tie, expensively made but possibly secondhand shoes – and 6 kg of cast-iron weights tied around his body, designed to drag him to the bottom of the North Sea. Almost three decades after finding the body of what appeared to be a murder victim in the waters off the island of Heligoland, German police have released new information and a first photofit in order to establish the identity of the man who was dubbed “the Gentleman” for his smart attire. Researchers at Staffordshire and Plymouth Marjon universities, in cooperation with the German Police Academy of Lower Saxony and the missing persons charity Locate International, have been collaborating on the cold case with the intention of uncovering the man’s name and bringing his killers to justice. After exhuming the man’s body last December, they have managed to isolate the complete DNA profile of the 45- to 50-year-old male and are currently checking it against international DNA databases, police in Wilhelmshaven in northern Germany announced on Thursday. An ongoing isotope analysis could eventually confirm whether the man had lived on the British Isles before his body was dumped in the North Sea, as investigators suspect. The body was recovered from the sea by a border guard boat on 11 July 1994, 20 km off Heligoland, but police believe it is possible that the body had travelled in the water for some distance. “He could have drifted from a ship or even as far as [from] Great Britain, that’s certainly possible,” said Karsten Bettels, of the Lower Saxony Police Academy. An autopsy at the time showed signs of exposure to blunt violence on the almost 2 metre-tall (6ft 5in) man’s head and upper body, which he had suffered while still alive. A further telling sign of a criminal act were the two cast-iron shoe lasts, each weighing 3 kg, which had been fixed to the man’s body to weigh him down, as police have revealed for the first time. Made in the 1920s or 30s, the two female shoe lasts were embossed with the initials AJK, the trademark of Bristol-based company AJ Jackson. Police have also for the first time released the make of the man’s tie, saying it was produced by Marks & Spencer for the English- and French-language market, which at the time of the man’s disappearance stretched all the way to Canada. Suspicions that the distinctive green, yellow and blue stripes marked the man out as belonging to a specific organisation had not been confirmed, police said. German police are seeking further information on the possible identity of the man from the public, having received over 50 pieces of information since appealing to the press in February. Another reason they have gone public again is to correct the victim’s misleading “gentleman” moniker, which was based on his elegant outfit and expensive shoes. “Against the backdrop of the latest information this impression has to be relativised,” police said. The M&S tie was a mass-market product and the shoes had been previously repaired and may have been bought secondhand, they said. “It cannot be necessarily assumed that the dead person was wealthy,” German police said in a statement.",News/World news,M&S tie and metal shoe lasts: new clues in cold case of ‘the Gentleman’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/28/heligoland-the-gentleman-researchers-mystery-german-cold-case-marks-spencer
