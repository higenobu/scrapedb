5/14/2022,"From the time of her research in the late 1980s, Ann Buchanan, who has died aged 80, was interested in the outcomes experienced by children in care. Through her work as a social worker, she showed that in adulthood such children developed significant mental health and other problems. Finding that the state did not always make the best parent, she looked at how to foster supportive positive family relationships for children’s wellbeing. This interest broadened into many other issues regarding children’s welfare. The effects of divorce on children, their mental health, fathering, the role of grandparents – all these and more provided empirical evidence that informed government policy and resulted in books both authored by Ann, such as Cycles of Child Maltreatment (1996), and co-edited, such as Brothers and Sisters (2021, with Anna Rotkirch). While she did much to quantify the importance of family relations, what was rare about her academic work – as in her practice as a social worker – was that she was less interested in theories than in practical solutions. Her work on outcomes tied in, too, with her early preoccupation with the lack of evidence for social work interventions – did they help service users or were they harmful? Before the term was adopted, she was an advocate for evidence-based practice. She believed also that research should not gather dust on shelves but that researchers should promote their findings and its implications, as she did all over the world. Even in nominal retirement, she advised governments in Russia, South Korea and elsewhere. In Greece she persuaded the authorities to improve conditions for Syrian refugee children, and was moved when, in China, her advice was taken that foster families, not institutionalisation, would best help those children orphaned by the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. At home, many of her recommendations were later adopted in the Children (Leaving Care) Act of 2000. Nothing in her background suggested her professional path. Indeed, quite the opposite: she was expected to follow the conventional path demanded of her class and time – marriage to a wealthy husband and motherhood. No woman in her extended family had been to university and only an aunt had had a professional career. Her father had no wish for an intellectual daughter, so, while her three brothers went to Eton, her education was patchy. But she defied expectations to eventually become Oxford University’s first female professor of social work, in 2006. Ann was born in Winchester into the Barings banking dynasty, the daughter of Raymond Baring and his wife, Margaret (nee Campbell-Preston), and granddaughter of Sir Godfrey Baring, a Liberal MP. She did not see her father until 1945, when he returned from wartime service when she was four. During the war her happy childhood was spent with her Scottish cousins at Ardchattan Priory in Argyll, home of her formidable maternal grandmother. The family moved to Bramley in Hampshire and, having failed her 11-plus, she went to St Mary’s school, Wantage, which she left at 16 to become a secretary. She was presented at court but adventure, not society, captured her imagination and at 20 she bought a one-way ticket to the US, where she worked as a secretary for Vogue in New York. She returned home, via the Pacific and Asia, with a work colleague as a travelling companion, the photojournalist Jill Krementz (who would later marry the novelist Kurt Vonnegut). Back in London, Ann became an advertising copywriter. At 22, she married Alistair Buchanan, a widowed banker. Their first child, a son, was stillborn; Ann said that his loss felt like losing an arm or a leg. She also suffered two late miscarriages and several bouts of pneumonia. These experiences changed her life and she became determined to avoid being “a useless woman” living a “selfish” life. In the early 70s, the family moved to Great Bedwyn in Wiltshire, but village life was not enough. In 1974, she joined Burderop hospital, near Swindon, as a research assistant. She left in 1980 to become a child psychiatric social worker, having gained a diploma in social work at Bath. She taught social work at Bracknell College, and in 1989 joined Southampton University as a lecturer. She was awarded a PhD the following year. In 1994 the lack of an undergraduate degree did not deny her a lectureship at Oxford University, with a fellowship at St Hilda’s, where she was appointed dean in 1995. There, she strongly emphasised her pastoral role. She was based at the university’s department of social policy and intervention, which was under threat of closure. But, thanks in part to the prodigious volume and quality of her research, it went on to achieve the top ranking in the country and third in the world for research in social sciences. Ann served on many bodies, including the Economic and Social Research Council, the council of the National Academy of Social Sciences, and the Baring Foundation. In 2012 she was made MBE. At the time of her death, she had two more books planned. I was the fortunate recipient of her last to-be-published piece of work, a chapter on residential care for a book I am editing, sent a month before she died. Many in her social circle were unaware of her eminence due to her discretion about what she did. Her warmth and hospitality hid a fierce commitment and determination, allied with a formidable work ethic. Alistair died in 2021 and that year, having suffered a major heart attack in 2000, which threatened to seriously diminish her capacity for work, Ann underwent heart surgery. Undeterred, she booked a cruise to see the northern lights and died in her sleep off the coast of Scotland. She is survived by three daughters, Katie, Tessa and Helen, and seven grandchildren.

5/14/2022,"John Wilkins, who has died aged 85, was the leading secular British Roman Catholic commentator of the last 40 years. As editor of the weekly Catholic magazine the Tablet, one of the oldest periodicals in the country, for nearly 22 years between 1982 and 2003, he was quite capable of infuriating the Vatican and the church’s more strident conservative polemicists with criticism of its reactionary stances on issues such as birth control, the place of women in the church, and ecumenism. Cardinal Basil Hume, the former leader of the church in England and Wales, once accused him of promoting a rival magisterium (church teaching). But his critics, reputedly from the pope down, all found they had to read what the Tablet said for informed and influential thought, always courteously and usually incisively expressed, on church and secular politics, international events and the arts. He tripled the circulation of a previously ailing publication, which during his editorship was read in more than 100 countries and even found nearly a fifth of its readership outside the Catholic Church. As the former Tory chairman Chris Patten, an occasional contributor, noted in a 1997 interview, the Tablet contained “a disproportionate number of articles which have made me feel better informed, highly entertained and even cross”. The magazine’s trustees contained some of the most eminent Catholics in British public life, including at various times Hugo Young, a former Guardian columnist; the former cabinet secretary Lord Hunt; William Rees-Mogg; and Graham Greene. Writers from across the religious and political spectrum, including myself, wrote for the Tablet, charmed by Wilkins into contributing despite the minuscule fees and the sometimes remorseless editing of their copy. His obsessiveness turned the magazine into a smart-looking and incisive product. He was a small, almost gnome-like figure with the manner and seriousness of an academic, but also the journalistic irreverence that would probably be essential to the editor of a magazine covering such an authoritarian institution. In an article written on Wilkins’s retirement, Young wrote that he had turned the Tablet into arguably the most influential Catholic weekly in the world, not by flailing against all authority but by retaining its independence. Contrary to the view of some in the hierarchy, Wilkins was determined that it should not be the unquestioning voice of Rome. Young wrote that Wilkins was “a friend of the church but not its slave, an ally but not one subornable into believing that criticism amounted to disloyalty”. Wilkins bristled when Hume – during a mass to celebrate the Tablet’s 150th anniversary in 1990 – chided the magazine for not always being helpful to the church. Wilkins retorted forcefully that it was not journalism’s job to be helpful to the institution. He did not start out a Catholic. Born in Bristol, he was the eldest of three children of Anglican parents, Ena (nee Francis) and Edward Wilkins, who ran a small factory making knitting needles. He won a scholarship to Clifton college, then, after national service in the Gloucestershire Regiment, studied classics and theology at Clare College, Cambridge. After a brief period working for Esso in the planning division, he became a journalist at the ecumenical journal Frontier in 1964. It was there that Wilkins converted to Catholicism, inspired by the reforms initiated by the 1960s second Vatican Council to open the church to the wider world rather than remaining a theocratic gerontocracy hostile to modernity and demanding unquestioning obedience. The council remained his inspiration even as the theocrats, most notably Pope John Paul II, reasserted control. Wilkins first joined the Tablet in 1967, becoming assistant editor before moving to the BBC external services five years later and working as a producer for Radio 4. He returned to the magazine as editor in 1982, making clear in his first editorial that the Tablet would address itself to the full range of Catholic opinion. “Our concern is with the world as much as the church, with everything that is human. We shall seek to inform and interpret as well as to comment,” he wrote. That editorial stance meant the magazine often found itself at odds with the Vatican, as John Paul closed down the possibility of debate on issues such as women’s ordination, homosexuality, abortion, contraception, and the admission of divorced and remarried Catholics to communion, making even questioning of the official position a test of orthodoxy. The Tablet’s criticism of the hierarchy’s complacency over clerical sex abuse was equally unwelcome. Wilkins was appointed MBE in 1998. He retired as editor in December 2003, succeeded by Catherine Pepinster, but retained close links with the magazine. An editorial in the Tablet following his death said Wilkins had wanted to keep the church’s debates open so that the influence of a less rigid kind of Catholicism would not be lost to future generations: “His technique was to accept the inevitability of an occasional yellow card but to avoid being shown a red one.” Wilkins is survived by his younger sister, Angela.

5/14/2022,"Durham’s Matthew Potts is pushing for a first Test call-up next week as England’s newly formed triumvirate of Rob Key, Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes start out with a worrying shortage of seam bowlers. Of the 11 frontline seamers to be capped in the past two years only four are playing in the current round of the County Championship, the last before selection for the first Test against New Zealand on 2 June. Ollie Robinson, among them, has bowled just one over for Sussex against Leicestershire. Robinson’s stomach complaint after a single outing so far and a winter of fitness woe, plus no sign of Chris Woakes yet due to shoulder and knee issues has opened the door for Potts, this season’s leading wicket-taker with 28 victims. Fresh from four for 61 against Glamorgan on Friday, he is now being considered for an upgrade after standby status during the recent Caribbean tour. Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad, frozen out of that trip, will be back at the behest of Stokes and like Craig Overton, who struggled with the new ball in their absence, are playing this week. Saqib Mahmood is missing the Roses match with a stiff back, however, and has turned out just once for Lancashire in April. Mahmood’s scans are clear but Jofra Archer and Mark Wood must first return from elbow injuries in white-ball cricket; so, too, Olly Stone after his lower-back stress fracture. Sam Curran is in the foothills of a comeback from the same issue and Matt Fisher, a debutant in Barbados, is out with a “stress reaction” to his back. Potts, tipped for higher honours by Stokes last week and with three five-wicket hauls in a surging summer, looks the likely beneficiary.

5/14/2022,"Amateur boxing has been plunged into a fresh crisis after the sole rival to the sport’s Russian president was barred from standing on the eve of the International Boxing Association’s election. Sources close to Iba have told the Guardian that the Dutch candidate Boris van der Vorst, who had been due to challenge Umar Kremlev for the Iba presidency, was barred for breaching its regulations by being part of an alliance of 18 countries that had openly criticised Iba’s reaction to the war in Ukraine and its reliance on Gazprom funding. On Friday Van der Vorst’s appeal to the court of arbitration for sport was denied. It means that the election, which had been delayed by 24 hours, will go ahead on Saturday with Kremlev standing unopposed. Five other candidates for Iba’s executive board, who were also on the Common Cause Alliance pressure group opposed to Kremlev, were also barred. The decision leaves boxing, which has been rocked by numerous judging and financial scandals in recent years, facing more questions about its Olympic future. Boxing is currently not on the roster for the LA Games in 2028 and, as revealed by the Guardian on Wednesday, the IOC sent a letter to Kremlev this week saying it had “significant concerns” about the governance and financing of Iba. After this latest news, many are now openly questioning whether there is any way back for the organisation. In a statement, Iba said that the decision had been taken by the Interim Nomination Unit, an independent body created in February to establish the eligibility and analyse the skillsets of nominees. The statement said: “Complaints were made to the Interim Nomination Unit on 11 and 13 April 2022 that the activities of these candidates were improper under the Iba regulations insofar as they constituted participation in another international boxing organisation, prohibited collaboration between candidates and electoral campaigning outside the Electoral period. “The activities in question were based around the creation of a group called the Common Cause Alliance in which the candidates listed participated, together with exchanges of open letters with the Iba.” The Dutch federation, led by Van der Vorst, was among 18 national federations, including the US, England, France, Australia and Canada, that formed the alliance earlier this year to ask the Iba to disclose financial information involved in its agreement with Gazprom. It later called for an eight-point action designed to address the damage caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine – and for the Iba to take stronger action against the Russian Boxing Federation. In a terse response to the news, the IOC said it was “monitoring the developments in Iba very closely”.",Sport/Sport,Amateur boxing crisis grows as Russian Iba president’s rival loses election appeal,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/12/amateur-boxing-crisis-boris-van-der-vorst-election-rival-to-russian-iba-president-umar-kremlev-barred
5/14/2022,"The House select committee investigating the Capitol attack made a political and legal gambit when it issued unprecedented subpoenas that compelled five Republican members of Congress to reveal inside information about Donald Trump’s effort to overturn the 2020 election. The move sets into motion an extraordinary high-stakes showdown of response and counter-response for both the subpoenaed House Republicans – the House minority leader Kevin McCarthy, Jim Jordan, Scott Perry, Andy Biggs and Mo Brooks – and the panel itself. Congressman Bennie Thompson, the Democrat chair of the select committee, authorized the subpoenas on Wednesday after the panel convened for final talks about whether to proceed with subpoenas, with House investigators needing to wrap up work before June public hearings. “We inquired to most of them via letter to come forward, and when they told us they would not come, we issued the subpoena,” Thompson said of McCarthy and his colleagues. “It’s a process. And the process was clearly one that required debate and discussion.” The decision came after a recognition that their investigation into January 6 would not have been complete if they did not at least attempt to force the cooperation of some of the House Republicans most deeply involved in Trump’s unlawful schemes to return himself to office. But the subpoenas are about deploying a political and legal power play in the crucial final moments of the investigation as much as they are about an effort to gain new information for the inquiry into efforts to stop Joe Biden’s certification in time for public hearings. That is evident in the conundrum faced by the subpoenaed House Republicans – with the knowledge that how they respond to the orders seeking testimony about their contacts with Trump will determine the future of the investigation and of congressional subpoena power. In the days before the select committee assented to Thompson signing off on the subpoenas, the members on the panel gamed-out the scenarios and reached the conclusion that subpoenas were actually a win-win situation, according to sources familiar with the discussions. If the subpoenaed House Republicans decided to comply and provide cooperation to the select committee as the subpoenas are designed to do, then the panel would obviously benefit from their testimony, the sources recounted of the panel’s discussion. If the subpoenaed House Republicans promised retaliatory subpoenas against Democrats should they take the House majority next year then they were going to do that anyway, the select committee reasoned, and they should issue the subpoenas. If the subpoenaed House Republicans simply ignored the orders, then they would only be undercutting their ability to subpoena Democrats in partisan investigations should the GOP take the House majority next year, since they would have set a precedent for non-compliance. The extent of cooperation by the five Republican members of Congress will also set an additional precedent: if McCarthy and his colleagues appear for a deposition but stonewall the inquiry, then Democrats would surely reciprocate in kind when they get subpoenaed. The select committee left their final meeting before Thompson signed off on the subpoenas hopeful of cooperation, but not really expecting anything, the sources said. If the House Republicans agreed to testify, it would be a welcome surprise. But that final point was key, the sources said, and the panel realised the subpoenas in that sense were almost self-enforcing. The issue at play is that House Republicans have been fantasising about subpoenaing Democrats in partisan investigations should they take the House majority. But those subpoenas would have power only if Republicans did not first undercut congressional subpoena power by defying them. The “precedent” question is often derided by Democrats as foolish since they believe Republicans would happily defy their subpoenas, only to then force Democrats to comply regardless of how Republicans previously behaved, but it got some consideration on Thursday. At least one of the subpoenaed House Republicans was seriously consulting about the precedent issue with his staff, according to staffers in that member’s office. And after the subpoenas were released, none of the five Republicans notably said they would defy them. The immediate and reflexive reaction on Capitol Hill to the subpoenas centred on how the select committee intended to enforce the subpoenas, but the panel has no real interest in pursuing any legal enforcement, the sources said. If the subpoenaed House Republicans sued to block the subpoenas in court, the select committee in that instance would probably have the House counsel, Doug Letter, contest the injunctions on behalf of the panel though only as a formality, the sources said. But if the subpoenaed House Republicans ignored the orders, the select committee would probably rely on the “self-enforcing” mechanism since any effort to have a court uphold the subpoena could take months and would outlast the panel’s existence, the sources said. The panel also told itself it could always decide whether to punish for non-compliance and refer the five Republican members of Congress for criminal contempt of Congress, though it was not clear whether the justice department would take up such a referral. Congressman Jamie Raskin, a Democrat member of the select committee, told reporters that he had little patience for Republicans’ complaints about the unprecedented nature of the subpoenas – and the binds faced by the five House Republicans. “If we have continued violence waged against the Congress, the vice president, the peaceful transfer of power, and members of congress have information, they should come and testify voluntarily,” Raskin said. “If they don’t, all of us should come to expect they could be subpoenaed.”",News/US news,Subpoenas of Trump allies involved in plot to overturn 2020 election sets up high-stakes showdown,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/13/jan-6-panels-subpoenas-trump-republicans-mccarthy
5/14/2022,"This has been a big week in British politics. If that makes you fear you have missed something, don’t worry. You have not. For that is just the point. This was an important week for Boris Johnson’s government to start trying to regain control of the political agenda. But the Conservative effort has not got off to a good start. That failure matters, because it will shape our politics. Within the next two years, there will be another general election. This month’s local elections confirmed that it will not be an easy one for the Tory party. The Tories lost seats to Labour and the Liberal Democrats and ceded hard-won ground in Scotland, Wales and England. Since it is likely to be the last one of substance in this parliament, the recent Queen’s speech needed to be focused on the general election. Yet it turned out to have very little focus at all. The speech’s aimless approach was revealing. There were a lot of announcements, but no election narrative. This says a lot about Mr Johnson’s party today. The prime minister talks incessantly, but does little that lasts. His new programme is a ragbag. It reflects a party that has become unable to articulate, in any unified way, what it is in government to achieve. It has no project beyond staying in power. The Tory party today is best understood as a loose and volatile alliance between overlapping rival groups. The rivalries start at the top, between a prime minister who wants to spend and a chancellor who does not. But, at a time when economic hardship is mounting so fast and likely to continue, the bulk of the cabinet remain extreme public spending cutters. All this helps to explain the announcement made on Thursday that 91,000 civil service jobs must be axed so that taxes can be cut. Of all the priorities facing Britain, slashing the public service by a fifth is one that should be at the back of the queue. The cut is ideological, arbitrary, unspecific and, in the context of current national and international needs and government commitments, it is almost mystifying. It is hard to square the cut with the need to cope with such realities as spiralling welfare demands, the need to rebuild the NHS or to lay the foundations of social care reform. It is perverse when seen in the context of the delays and bureaucracy facing business and industry as a result of Brexit. It makes sense only as a headline flash of rhetoric for the party’s right wing. It solves precisely nothing, including the Tory predicament exposed in the local elections. It was significant that the former health and foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt chose Friday to break cover and offer the Tory party a glimpse of a less bankrupt approach. Acknowledging the scale of the task that the Tory party now faces, Mr Hunt drew a direct connection between cuts in the NHS and tragedies like the Mid-Staffs scandal. The topicality of his warning that the party faces defeat if it offers voters a choice between a properly funded NHS and tax cuts was unmistakable on a day when the government had just done precisely that. This week was important because of Mr Johnson’s failure. Just like any entitled Bourbon he has learned nothing and forgotten nothing. He seems determined to be the author of his own defeat. His failure signals further Tory defeats at the polls, renewed anxiety on the backbenches, and a possible leadership contest, in which Mr Hunt is likely to stand. In such grim economic times, the Tory party’s fortunes may no longer be in their own hands, but in those of the opposition parties and, most of all, those of the public.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the Conservatives: a party without a project | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/13/the-guardian-view-on-the-conservatives-a-party-without-a-project
5/14/2022,"Ministers have been accused of cutting corners and endangering children after the government confirmed it would consult on cutting childcare staffing ratios so that one adult can look after five two-year-olds. The education minister Will Quince announced that the government would consult on what he called “mirroring the Scottish model”, which allows a maximum of five two-year-olds, instead of four in England, to be cared for by one adult. The plan, which is part of the government’s agenda to tackle the cost of living crisis, prompted a furious response from nursery providers and opposition parties. The Liberal Democrats’ education spokesperson, Munira Wilson, said: “Boris Johnson’s new plan is not to address soaring childcare costs head-on, but instead to cut corners and endanger our children. Their safety should be our number one priority, not be reduced to a cost-cutting measure. Neil Leitch, the chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, said the childcare sector was already “on its knees” with “underpaid, overworked” staff. “The ignorance and shortsightedness that would lead anyone to suggest relaxing ratios as a solution to the problems our sector faces is frankly mind-boggling,” he said. The minister stressed that he had rejected more radical plans to deregulate the sector. “This proposal is about giving providers greater flexibility,” he said. “Some were pushing me to go further on ratio reform but I’ve been clear from the start that I would not compromise on safety or quality.” He hinted at further changes in the future, however, saying: “This consultation is just the start of the journey. We have some of the best early years provision in the world, and I’ll continue exploring how we can be ambitious for working parents – improving flexibility and reducing the cost of childcare.” With inflation expected to hit double digits in the autumn, Whitehall departments have been charged with coming up with ways to cut costs for households, without directly spending taxpayers’ money. Childcare ratios will be unchanged in Wales, at one adult to four two-year-olds. The Welsh government’s economy minister, Vaughan Gething, told the BBC: “Childcare is devolved here in Wales and we won’t be cutting the ratios, because there’s no evidence that will improve the quality of the childcare or the availability of it as well.”",Lifestyle/Money,Ministers accused of cutting corners on childcare staffing ratios,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/13/ministers-accused-of-cutting-corners-on-childcare-staffing-ratios
5/14/2022,"The government is to delay a ban on “buy one get one free” deals on junk food and a pre-9pm watershed for TV advertising, as Boris Johnson puts the cost of living crisis before a promise to tackle the UK’s growing obesity problem. The prime minister is understood to have decided to delay the implementation of the policies by at least a year – and potentially scrap them altogether – after chairing a ministerial meeting seeking ideas to help alleviate the cost of living crisis on Wednesday. The decision to postpone the new measures, which were designed to be some of the toughest marketing restrictions in the world, immediately drew criticism from health campaigners. “Obesity is spiking and millions of families can’t afford to put proper food on the table,” said Barbara Crowther of the Children’s Food Campaign. “Multi-buy offers make people spend more on junk, and less on healthy food. This delay threatens the UK target to halve childhood obesity by 2030. Boris is playing politics with our children’s health.” The ban on “Bogof” promotions was due to come into force from October, but as households struggle to cope with soaring energy bills and with inflation at a 40-year high, scrapping cheap offers is now seen as a risky political move. According to multiple sources the government will still push ahead with a ban on junk food promotions in certain high-profile store locations, such as at aisle ends, checkouts and entrances, as well as prominent positions in supermarket apps and websites. Last month, Kellogg’s, the owner of cereals such as Coco Pops and Special K, launched legal action against the government over the rules would prevent the brand from promoting some of its products prominently on shelves. The government is also delaying the implementation of a ban on TV adverts for foods high in fat, salt and sugar before 9pm, which was due to come into force from January. It is also thought that the delay will extend to plans to ban junk food advertising online. The timeline for introducing the ban on TV and online adverts was already under pressure as the government has not yet launched a consultation on how the ban would work, such as penalties for breaking it. It is understood there was already a mechanism built into the plans to potentially delay the start of the ban. Boris Johnson is said to have been convinced by ministers that the bans would be extremely costly to the food and advertising industries at a time when the economy is under intense pressure, according to the Times, which first reported the government’s plans to delay. More than £600m is spent by brands on food advertising online and on TV annually. The ban on TV adverts for foods high in fat, salt and sugar before 9pm could have cost broadcasters, such as ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5 and Sky, more than £200m a year in revenue.",News/Business,UK delays ban on supermarket junk food deals and pre-watershed ads,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/may/13/uk-delays-ban-on-supermarket-junk-food-deals-and-pre-watershed-ads
5/14/2022,"It’s taken a while, but I’ve finally spotted one of those “Brexit opportunities” cited in the job title of the cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg. Thanks to the UK’s departure from the European Union, the British government has gifted us with an apparently bottomless supply of industrial-strength bullshit. I use the term in the sense distilled by the eminent philosopher Harry G Frankfurt, whose bestselling treatise, On Bullshit, defined it as speech intended to persuade without regard for truth. While your basic liar cares about the truth enough to hide it, the pedlar of bullshit is unbothered whether their words are true or false, so long as the listener is persuaded. Insouciance towards the facts is the essential trait. The Brexit project was always rich in bullshit – the £350m on the side of the bus could have come straight from Frankfurt’s essay – so it’s hardly a surprise that this government of Brexiters has become a world-beating producer of the stuff. Its latest batch relates to the Northern Ireland protocol, which the government says is “fundamentally undermining” the Good Friday agreement that brought peace to the province after three decades of murderous war. The Democratic Unionist party, which campaigned hard for leave in 2016 – even as Northern Ireland voted to remain by 56% to 44% – so despises the protocol, it refuses to take up its place in Belfast’s devolved institutions until it’s gone. The Northern Ireland minister Conor Burns waves before the cameras a thick ream of documents showing the sheer volume of paperwork the protocol demands simply to move goods between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. Who, the unsuspecting viewer wonders, could be responsible for such a heinous measure? Which authority, either wicked or stupid, imposed on Boris Johnson and his government a protocol that is making business impossible, thwarting self-rule in Northern Ireland and jeopardising peace? The answer, of course, is Boris Johnson and his government. As he and his ministers know, none of this was forced on them by “a foreign power”, as Rees-Mogg puts it. On the contrary, the protocol was devised, praised and then passed into law by Johnson, his ministers and his MPs. They want to blame the Europeans, pretending it’s beastly Brussels that is so heedless of Northern Ireland and its exceptionally delicate position – but this is entirely on them. They’re hoping most of us will have forgotten how this situation arose; and it’s quite true that Britons do have an ignoble tendency towards forgetfulness when it comes to Ireland. But it’s not that long ago. Once the Conservative party was bent on a hard Brexit that took the UK out of both the customs union and single market, that meant there would have to be a border marking those bodies’ outer frontier. Most could see that that border could not be on the island of Ireland, separating the Republic from the north, without reopening the wounds of the Troubles. That left only one option: Northern Ireland would retain some of the old European arrangements, and the border would run down the Irish Sea. But that would distinguish Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, striking directly at unionism’s defining creed: that Northern Ireland and Britain are one. No British prime minister would do such a thing, said Theresa May. “Under no circumstances,” agreed Johnson in July 2019. But a few months later, he broke that promise. He did it so he could get a deal with the EU, claim it was “oven ready” and win a general election on that basis. Which he duly did. Even at the time, the government’s own official documents showed how this new bargain would entail the very border checks that Johnson now describes as unacceptable. One senior mandarin had patiently spelled it all out to the prime minister, in detail. But he couldn’t have cared less, that official tells me. All that mattered was being able to say a deal had been done. Johnson thought he would deal with the consequences later. After all, it was only Northern Ireland. And so here we are. Ah, but the problem is not the protocol itself, say ministers. It’s all about the way Brussels is implementing it. That doesn’t wash: any border down the Irish Sea, however softly handled or lightly enforced, would offend that defining article of unionist faith. But let’s say light-touch implementation would help and was all the UK government wanted. If that were true, then London would be engaged in the slow, patient work of diplomacy and talks, “grinding through the technicalities”, as one former negotiator puts it. But it has not been doing that. Instead of welcoming moves from the other side, it has preferred grandstanding, threatening to blow the whole thing up. Now it says it will “disapply” the protocol altogether, refusing to honour what it agreed. That would, as May has argued, destroy Britain’s international reputation at a stroke: the UK would be a rogue state, its signature worthless. It would also prompt EU retaliation, triggering a trade war that would cost UK businesses dear, just as the country is in the grip of a cost-of-living crisis. From the start, this issue has involved magical thinking: remember the mythical “alternative arrangements” that would somehow make the border vanish into thin air? Six years after the referendum, the Brexit bullshit keeps coming. Today alone, Rees-Mogg suggested one of the benefits of Brexit was the ability to tackle the shortage of HGV drivers – when it was Brexit that made that shortage so much worse. He said “The economic benefits of Brexit are … coming through the whole time,” when the dogs on the street know Brexit has hit UK trade hard, as putting up barriers between us and our biggest, nearest market was always going to. Rees-Mogg was touring the broadcast studios to announce a new drive to cut 90,000 civil service jobs – apparently hoping we’d forget that not long ago the government was telling us it needed to hire 50,000 more people to process, you guessed it, Brexit paperwork. Back when we were in the EU, it was butter mountains and wine lakes we had to contend with. Now that we’re on the outside, we face a far uglier blot on the national landscape: a vast and growing heap of bullshit. And it stinks.

5/14/2022,"Newcastle United wearing the colours of Saudi Arabia’s national football side on their away shirt next season would be “clear evidence” of sportswashing by the Gulf regime, Amnesty International has said. Leaked images were circulated online on Thursday night purporting to show Newcastle’s strips for the forthcoming season, the first full term under the majority ownership of the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF). Although photos showed the home colours remaining the traditional black and white, the away colours were white with a green trim, the same as the Saudi national team and a combination never worn by the Premier League side. Questions over the proximity of PIF to the Saudi state have persisted since the Premier League allowed a takeover to go through last October. The league said it had guarantees Saudi Arabia would not control Newcastle, but Amnesty said the images suggested otherwise. “If it is true that Newcastle United is changing its away kit to match Saudi Arabia’s national colours, it exposes the power of the Saudi dollar and the kingdom’s determination to sportswash its brutal, blood-soaked human rights record,” Felix Jakens, Amnesty International UK’s head of campaigns, said. “Despite all their assurances of a separation between the Saudi owners and the club this seems like clear evidence of the regime using Newcastle to portray a positive image. “Everyone – from fans to champions – needs to resist being part of Saudi Arabia’s propaganda drive, be aware of what is going on there and speak out about the government’s abuses: the mass executions, [the journalist Jamal] Khashoggi’s murder and dire situation for LGBTI+ people. Sport must not be allowed to be used like this.” The Guardian made multiple attempts to contact Newcastle United but received no reply to a request for comment. The news came on the day that Newcastle appointed the chief executive of the Saudi Golf Federation, Majed al-Sorour, to their board. Sorour’s Golf Saudi project has commissioned Greg Norman to build a course near Riyadh, and the PIF is one of the chief backers of the Australian’s controversial LIV Golf invitational series. This week Norman described the murder of Khashoggi, an act believed by US authorities to have been approved by the Saudi ruler Mohammed bin Salman, as a “mistake”. Amnesty told the Guardian that Norman’s remarks were “wrong and seriously misguided”.",Sport/Football,"Newcastle kit sharing Saudi colours would be sportswashing, Amnesty says",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/13/newcastle-kit-sharing-saudi-arabia-colours-sportswashing-amnesty
5/14/2022,"For a manager close to winning so much Jürgen Klopp is remarkably sanguine about the risk of trophies slipping from his grasp over the next fortnight. Had he wanted guaranteed success the Liverpool manager would have accepted one of several job offers from Bayern Munich. Digging in and fighting for it suits his nature better. Part two of the quadruple chase takes Liverpool to Wembley for the third time in four months on Saturday, seeking a first FA Cup triumph in 16 years. Chelsea, Manchester City and Real Madrid. The strength of each opponent in the way of a historic achievement demonstrates the scale of Liverpool’s task and ensures there is no certainty to how the campaign will end. The high stakes and fine margins do not worry Klopp, who is so content that he managed two afternoon naps on Wednesday after Liverpool’s win at Aston Villa the night before. “Which club should I go to, to have a different situation?” he says when asked about the challenges and stresses that the decisive final weeks of the season will bring. “The only thing I could do is ask Pep [Guardiola] if he is sick of all that winning and I take over at City. That wouldn’t work, I don’t want to do it. I could have gone to Bayern a few times, [where] I could have won more titles in my life, pretty sure I would say – a good chance at least. I didn’t do it. I had a contract here and I never did it. “The world is not full of winners, the world is full of triers hopefully. And I try and sometimes I win with other people together. I am happy with that. I am not always positive; give me a second and I will find a reason for optimism, that’s probably true, but that’s it. This club went through incredibly tough periods and always hit back and if people can’t appreciate the time we are in or the team they have I would really feel for them, because it’s fantastic what the boys do. “If you saw the Aston Villa game, the situation we are in, you could write books about the resilience of these boys. One-nil down, everything looks like: ‘Ah, this time.’ But no. We are three points away [from City] and seven goals. We will try. We cannot do more and I can enjoy that. If people can’t, I cannot change that.” Winning the FA Cup “would mean the world to us” according to Klopp, though he readily admits to having no personal history with a competition celebrating its 150th anniversary. “I don’t have a lot of FA Cup final memories,” he says. “Do people get asked if they have any memories of the DFB-Pokal?” Klopp’s last game in charge of Borussia Dortmund was a DFB-Pokal final against Wolfsburg in May 2015. Kevin De Bruyne was among the Wolfsburg goalscorers in a 3-1 win that denied Klopp a fairytale farewell. Seven years on and De Bruyne is still a thorn in the Liverpool manager’s side, scoring four times as City re-established a three point lead in the title race with a 5-1 rout of Wolves on Wednesday. In a week when City also announced the £51.5m signing of Erling Haaland, and Sadio Mané was linked with Bayern, future challenges to Liverpool were made clear, if they were not already. Klopp’s priority is the present, however, and savouring every moment of a remarkable pursuit. “If we are only happy when we are winning in the end, whenever your race finishes, what life would that be?” he says. “When I say, ‘Enjoy the journey’, I mean it. Enjoy the journey because there have been so many great moments already. “If we stop now it’s not great that we didn’t win the FA Cup final and didn’t win the Champions League final and came second in the Premier League. Forget that and just say: ‘Wow, that was a ride.’ “We only cause ourselves problems as human beings. ‘Don’t come home without a quadruple,’ for example – then you will never be happy. If that is the only way to satisfy you that is really difficult. Let’s give it a go. Football games are sometimes decided by single players; most of the time they are decided by the whole performance and we can work on the whole performance and have world-class players – and we will have world-class players. “It is not what other teams are doing and like: ‘God, they signed him.’ I never thought that, to be honest. When they took a player from me and put him there, in Germany quite frequently, it gives them 20% extra, and us minus 20%, and that’s not cool. But as long as they don’t pick from us I’m fine.” Klopp adds: “It [the quadruple] has never been done before so it’s like the first step on whichever island. We know the decisive part is coming now. Warming up is finished and we have rhythm, finally. Now we can go for it.”",Sport/Football,Jürgen Klopp tells Liverpool ‘enjoy the journey’ as quadruple hunt goes on,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/13/jurgen-klopp-tells-liverpool-enjoy-the-journey-as-quadruple-hunt-goes-on
5/14/2022,"The veteran character actor Fred Ward, best known for appearances in The Right Stuff, Tremors and Short Cuts, has died aged 79. A statement to the New York Post by Ward’s representative said that the actor died on 8 May. No cause of death was given, but the statement said it was Ward’s wish for donations to be made to the Boston University Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy Center. Born in San Diego, Ward joined the air force before deciding to become an actor. Having found it difficult to land roles, he worked as a lumberjack, sailor and boxer before restarting his acting career in Italy, where an early credit was in a 1974 Roberto Rossellini TV movie about Descartes. Returning to the US, he finally got noticed in Hollywood as the bank robber John Anglin, Clint Eastwood’s fellow escapee in Escape from Alcatraz. More high-profile roles followed: in Southern Comfort as murderous corporal Reece, as a Vietnam vet in Uncommon Valor, and in The Right Stuff as flawed astronaut Gus Grissom. Ward was then cast in the title role of Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins, a 1985 film that was supposed to the first in a series of action thrillers featuring the character from the Destroyer detective novels. But the film was not a success and Ward returned to character and supporting roles. Highlights included Henry Miller in the literary erotic drama Henry & June; handyman Earl Bassett in the horror-comedy Tremors and studio security chief Walter Stuckel in Robert Altman’s The Player. Ward also used his own money to option Miami Blues, the cult 90s thriller in which he played a detective. The connection with Altman gave Ward his most high-profile success: in the Raymond Carver adaptation Short Cuts, Ward played one of a group of men on a fishing trip who discover a body in the water. Ward would won a Golden Globe as part of the film’s ensemble cast, as well as the Venice film festival’s Volpi cup for acting (again for the entire cast). Ward worked steadily throughout the 1990s and 2000s, averaging two or three films a year; he also made appearances in TV shows such as ER, Grey’s Anatomy and True Detective.",Arts/Film,"Veteran actor Fred Ward, star of The Right Stuff and Tremors, dies aged 79",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/13/fred-ward-star-right-stuff-tremors-dies-aged-79
5/14/2022,"Like Julian Coman (Labour may think it’s moving on, but working-class voters aren’t following, 10 May), I travelled by coach as a schoolboy many years ago with another branch of the Manchester United supporters’ club. Like the Bradford bus, almost everyone on ours was working class – except me. My dad was an academic, my mum a social worker and I was privately educated, but in contrast to Julian’s experience, our return trip in 1961 from London to see United against West Bromwich Albion at the Hawthorns could not have been more harmonious. My travelling companions, all strangers, took me under their wing, showing me where to get a match-day programme, where to see the United team arrive, and the best place to get autographs after the match. There was then widespread outrage when I asked United’s skipper, Noel Cantwell, for his signature and he walked straight past me hissing: “Fuck off, I’m not signing.” That was regarded as well out of order. I felt strongly that there was a genuine sense of solidarity there, overriding social class, which pleased me, especially as I was treated to bottles of beer. Of course there was a north-south divide even then, but it didn’t stop Labour, under northerner Harold Wilson, winning the general election in 1964, with his inspirational slogan about the “white heat of technology” appealing to all classes. To close the cultural divide today, we need expressive use of language like that.Giles OakleyEast Sheen, London  I share Julian Coman’s concern about the cultural divide between Labour-supporting urban professionals and some older working-class people. I also share his frustration with the excesses of what he calls political correctness. But many of us who believe the working class is the crucial and irreplaceable driving force for socialism recognise that it is necessary to criticise those who succumb to racist and other backward ideas. Coman, like the ideologues of “blue Labour” whose ideas he knowingly or unknowingly reflects, is seemingly against doing this, preferring instead to deny all the publicly available evidence that Brexit was indeed a “xenophobic, reactionary project”. Respecting people involves not lying to them. And, as a matter of fact, C1s and Bs (for instance teachers, social workers, many civil service and local government workers, and many service-sector workers) are the core of the working class in Britain today. They are overwhelmingly socially liberal and supportive of multiculturalism. And, by clear margins, they voted remain in the 2016 referendum.Jim DenhamBirmingham  Julian Coman’s account of Tory-voting working-class northerners left me perplexed. As the son of Conservative-voting, working-class Merseysiders, I used to put this down to the deference-based culture of the time (coming of political age in the 1960s). The explanation for today is apparently that working-class people vote Tory because the educated active and representative Labour members show “myopic intolerance” towards them. As a finishing touch, Coman commends the analysis of Raymond Williams, which accords with the apparent current sense of perceived loss of “solid community” by working-class Brexiters. My worry is that while such longings for community may still exist, the solidity of such working-class communities no longer does. The more important question is what culture has replaced it and why people – then as now – fail to vote along the lines of their own self-interest (ie by voting Labour) but instead relate to the elite, privately educated cultural worlds of Nigel Farage or Boris Johnson. It is this fact that requires an explanation, unrelated to either a nostalgia for the past or the lodging of blame to the caricatured Labour activist.Geof RaynerDraughton, Northamptonshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

5/14/2022,"Gareth Taylor expects Manchester City’s Women’s FA Cup final against Chelsea at Wembley on Sunday to be a slugfest and is clear that even if his team fail to win their season has been a success. City go into the game in sparkling form, having won 13 games in a row, a sequence that includes beating Emma Hayes’s side 3-1 in the League Cup final, the second trophy of Taylor’s three-year tenure after he guided his side to the 2020 FA Cup. Victory against Reading on the final day of the Women’s Super League campaign secured Champions League qualification for City and they face a Chelsea team who are the FA Cup holders and WSL champions. Taylor is relishing Sunday’s showpiece. “It’s going to be fantastic – it is two good teams going at it, slugging it out, two teams who have shown really good quality this season,” the manager said. “It’s great for fans of both teams to see their teams going at it; hopefully for the neutral as well it will be an exciting game. We hope to see some good football played, some good talent on display and worthy victors at the end. “Of course it’s massive [to beat Chelsea]. We want to do it, there’s no doubt about that. But there’s a really healthy respect between the clubs, a healthy respect between the players, between myself and Emma, the two organisations. Why wouldn’t we commend what they’ve done? Emma’s been there a long time [10 years], she’s been supported, she’s won trophies, got to finals, she’s done amazingly well. Emma Hayes has revealed Fran Kirby has completed a week’s training and will be available for Sunday’s FA Cup final. Kirby had been ruled out by the manager “for the foreseeable future” on 15 April as the club sought answers to a fatigue problem and there were concerns she would not return before the Euros this summer. “I don’t want to put any pressure on her because I love that kid and she’s been through a lot, but she looked like she hadn’t been away, she looked that good in training and it’s nice to see the smile on her face,” Hayes said. “She’s been in training all week so I’m over the moon.” Hayes described the forward, who missed much of the 2019-20 season with pericarditis, as a “generational talent”. “Rarely have I seen a football player that can do what she does in the way she finds space, makes decisions and plays with selfless attributes,” she said. “She has eyes in the back of her head. She is a winner every day. She is grumpy when it’s not going well because she wants to win so badly.” Hayes revealed that she had had lunch with the prospective new Chelsea owner Todd Boehly on Friday. “He watched the girls train, [I] had a really lovely couple of hours with him. He was delightful, really passionate, he’s just a normal down-to-earth guy who’s really passionate about Chelsea, loves Chelsea. He’s ambitious, as we are, and it is a perfect fit.” Suzanne Wrack “We’ve been there before in cup finals and so have Chelsea, so there’s no real edge for either team. It’s just who goes out and performs best.” City’s closing phase of the campaign came after a start that featured four losses from the opening seven games. Taylor received criticism despite his squad being seriously hampered by injuries, the nadir a 5-0 loss at Arsenal in the league for which 10 players were unavailable. “Unfortunately there is a lot of criticism out there – hopefully people have seen how we turned it around,” he said. “I was a player for more than 20 years; we do struggle to say: ‘Well done.’ Unfortunately we can all highlight the negative stuff. But even when we were missing huge personalities and players, what we were doing wasn’t a million miles off.” Sam Kerr scored twice in Chelsea’s 3-0 win over Arsenal in December’s Covid-delayed 2021 final. The Australian forward did the same in the final-day 4-2 victory over Manchester United that clinched the title, further underlining the threat she poses. “Sam is a very good player but if we concentrate too much on her then we may neglect other very good players that Chelsea have,” Taylor said. “She was very gracious in defeat [after the League Cup final] – the way she handled herself was spectacular.” Taylor will enjoy a good breakfast on Cup final day. “If you had asked me what I would have when I was a player I would have told you something to do with superstition but as I got to the end of my career I realised it was nonsense – it didn’t work,” he said. “So on Sunday if I see some nice pancakes on the side at the hotel they are making the day.” Even if City do not lift the cup Taylor wants his players to have pride. “We want to win another trophy,” he said. “It’s one we’ve been successful in previously but whatever happens on Sunday, we’re proud of the season and we’re moving in the right direction.” Demi Stokes is in contention again after a family issue and Jess Park is available after being injured since early last month.",Sport/Football,Taylor tips Manchester City and Chelsea to ‘slug it out’ in Women’s FA Cup final,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/13/gareth-taylor-tips-manchester-city-and-chelsea-to-slug-it-out-in-womens-fa-cup-final
5/14/2022,"A lot of attention has been given to Sinn Féin becoming the largest party in the Northern Ireland assembly as a result of last week’s election (DUP to block formation of Northern Ireland power-sharing executive, 9 May). More significantly, the parties supporting the Northern Ireland protocol received 53.5% of first preference votes, compared with 40.1% for those parties against, resulting in 52 members in favour to 35 against. Of course, not everyone voted with the protocol in mind, and there were some small parties not in these figures. But it does indicate that those against the protocol are a minority. Obviously, this does not mean that the opinions of those against the protocol do not matter. Their concerns should be addressed – but only in ways which take into account the views of the majority in favour of the protocol. And, democratically, they do not justify obstructing the establishing of a new Northern Ireland executive, as the Democratic Unionist party is doing.Clem McCartneyLimavady, County Londonderry  The government intends to further erode the right to peaceful protest by snatching away its legitimacy on the grounds of inconvenience. Meanwhile, its ally the DUP is conducting a protest which snatches away the legitimacy of the democratic process itself.

5/14/2022,"Ministers’ plans to slash 90,000 jobs from the civil service come at a time when there are a series of administrative logjams in the system – which a drop in staff numbers could exacerbate. The Passport Office has just announced that it is hiring 700 extra staff after widespread reports of people being unable to travel as planned because of significant delays in receiving passports or receiving updates on what is happening. There is an ongoing scramble for scarce appointments – and warnings that new passports could take weeks to be issued. The new staff will be hired by an outside contractor, Teleperformance, which indicates another potential issue with a wholesale reduction in civil service numbers – if staff are simply replaced by contractors, little money is likely to be saved. A longer-running saga even than the passport imbroglio. Large numbers of people have complained about significant delays receiving documents from, or even being able to contact, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. The issues appeared to begin with Covid-related issues at the DVLA’s Swansea base, with some people saying they had waited for up to six months. Home Office data shows that just over 100,000 visas have now been issued, from around 133,000 applications, under the schemes by which displaced Ukrainians can come to the UK because of family links or because they are sponsored by an individual or organisation.

5/14/2022,"Police Scotland has paid out nearly £1m in compensation to a former firearms officer victimised by “horrific” boys’ club sexism in the force’s elite armed response unit. The force’s chief constable, Iain Livingstone, has also apologised to Rhona Malone, who quit the force’s firearms unit in Edinburgh where misogynistic abuse and bullying were rife. Malone has been awarded £948,000 in damages and costs after she won an employment tribunal last year which found the armed response unit was dominated by an “absolute boys club culture” that was “horrific”. The tribunal did not find she was the victim of sex discrimination but did find Malone had been victimised under the Equalities Act 2010, after she complained about a written recommendation stating that two women firearms officers should not be deployed together if a male one was available. The email from Insp Keith Warhurst said that apart from “the obvious differences in physical capacity, it makes more sense from a search, balance of testosterone perspective.” After a heated meeting where Malone challenged Warhurst about his memo, where he denied being sexist, he threatened to suspend her from duty because she was not acting in a “calm/restrained and controlled manner”. She submitted a formal complaint against Warhurst alleging discrimination after a series of incidents, supported by often uncontested evidence from witnesses, including other female officers, of routinely sexist and abusive attitudes in the unit. The tribunal found that those complaints included Warhurst distributing images of topless women on an internal WhatsApp group; Warhurst speaking of another male officer “fucking” a female colleague; Warhurst describing the pregnant wife of another as “a fucking fat bitch”; and a senior officer telling one female firearms officer to “fuck off” when she asked for a two-piece uniform instead of a boiler suit, as that made it easier to use the toilet. The tribunal also heard that another female officer, Sgt Rachel Coates, was told by a senior instructor that women should not be firearms officers “because they menstruated and this would affect their temperament”. Warhurst later apologised to Malone, but without their knowledge a senior officer continued to pursue an internal grievance following Malone’s earlier complaint. The tribunal found the internal inquiry reports were selective, inaccurate and wrongly implied both officers were equally to blame. Malone submitted a grievance about the handling of her complaints, the actions of a senior officer investigating her complaints and Warhurst’s continuing role in requesting medical checks, and eventually applied to leave the police on the grounds of ill health. After winning her tribunal case, Malone told the BBC that Police Scotland had initially asked her to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) in exchange for an out of court settlement, which she refused to sign. Malone also accused the Scottish Police Federation and its lawyers of trying to force her to accept the NDA, and then refusing to fund her legal action when she declined to accept it. The federation’s lawyer said she was “deliberately choosing to be stubborn”. Margaret Gribbon, Malone’s lawyer, said: “My client has lost a promising police career and the tribunal heard evidence from other armed female officers who had been trained at considerable public expense, but have been driven out of the firearms division because of the rampant culture of sexism.” In a statement issued on Friday, the force apologised for “its poor response when a dedicated and promising officer raised legitimate concerns. The chief constable also emphasised his personal commitment to leading change in policing in Scotland which drives equality and inclusion to improve the experiences of all women, including our own officers and staff.”",News/UK news,Police Scotland pays out nearly £1m to ex-officer over sexism case,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/13/police-scotland-pays-damages-ex-officer-rhona-malone-sexism-case
