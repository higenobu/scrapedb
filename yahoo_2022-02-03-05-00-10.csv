2/3/2022,"An innocent Christmas present turned into a nightmare for an Ohio couple, who learned through an at-home DNA test that the child they had raised for 28 years was not biologically related to her father, a new lawsuit claims. According to the suit, Mike and Jeanine Harvey underwent an artificial insemination procedure at Summa Akron City Hospital in 1991, resulting in the birth of their daughter, Jessica, the next year. They never suspected anything was amiss, and raised their daughter in keeping with her father’s Italian heritage. In a press conference, Mike Harvey said his daughter even took Italian in high school and practiced speaking it with her paternal grandmother. Nearly three decades later, Jessica decided to travel to Italy, and her parents purchased her an Ancestry.com DNA test so she could find and connect with any distant relatives still living across the Atlantic. But when the results came back, the Hareys said at the press conference, they showed no Italian roots in Jessica’s genealogy—in fact, they suggested she was not biologically related to her father at all. Two California Couples Swapped Babies In IVF Mix-Up, Suit Says Unable to believe the results of the test, the complaint states, Jessica submitted her DNA to another genetic testing company, and she and her father underwent paternity testing with an independent lab. Both returned the same result: She and her father were not genetically related. After some genealogical sleuthing, the family was able to track down a man who appeared to be Jessica’s biological father. Contacted by the family, the man confirmed that he and his wife had been patients of the same doctor, Nicholas Spirtos, in 1991, but had never conceived a child. Paternity testing confirmed that the man was indeed her biological father. In a press conference Wednesday, Mike Harvey said the entire experience had been “like waking up in someone else’s life.” “As a husband and a father, it’s extremely difficult to watch your family in pain,” he said. “Learning that your entire reality isn’t what you believed it to be is hard to explain.” The family is now suing the doctor and the hospital system for medical malpractice, negligence, and lack of informed consent, among other things. In a statement, the hospital said it “take[s] this allegation seriously and understand the impact this has on the family.” Mike, Jessica, and Jeanine Harvey “At this point, we have not met with the family or conducted testing of our own,” the statement said. “Given the very limited information that we have and the amount of time that has passed, it remains our hope that the attorneys representing the family will work with us to make that next step a priority.” An attorney for the Harveys pushed back on this statement in the press conference, saying they had sent both Summa Health and Dr. Spiros extensive medical records and a draft complaint seven months ago. The attorney, Ashlie Case Sletvold, said the hospital did not attempt to meet with the family or conduct their own testing during that time. Dr. Spirtos did not respond to a request for comment sent through his office. Cases such as these have risen dramatically in recent years due to the popularity of at-home genetic testing—in fact, the plaintiffs’ lawyer, Adam Wolf, has previously said that he sees a spike in cases in February, after families like the Harveys receive the results of DNA tests purchased over the holidays. Popular genetic testing company 23andMe includes a warning label on its products that says customers ​​”might discover unexpected relationships,” and adds: “Though not common, these discoveries could affect you and your family.” Mike and Jessica Harvey Wolf said he has represented thousands of victims of fertility center misconduct. In the press conference, he called for greater regulation of the IVF industry, referring to it as the “Wild West.” “After several decades and thousands of fertility misconduct cases, we are still in the ‘Wild West’ era,” he said in a statement. “How many more people will have to share their heartbreaking stories before our legislators take this problem seriously?” Jeanine Harvey, meanwhile, said her family’s experience had been “a trauma that I never could have imagined.” “For us, and for countless unsuspecting families out there, it took just one Christmas gift—a home DNA test kit—to change our lives forever,” she said in a statement. “It’s taken every ounce of my power to remain strong for myself and my family as we try to move forward.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

2/3/2022,"A video of a Chinese mother of eight chained around the neck in a small village hut sparked online outrage and discussion on human trafficking and women’s rights in rural China.

The video footage went viral on Douyin after a vlogger visited Huankou village in Feng County in the eastern Jiangsu province and was shocked by the living conditions of the woman, identified as Yang, reported BBC.

In the video, the vlogger can be seen speaking to the woman’s child in a home before he walks over to a doorless shed outside, revealing the dazed woman dressed in a light sweater in the cold winter temperature with an iron chain around her neck.

The child reportedly told the vlogger that their mother is given food daily, according to What's on Weibo. The man filming reportedly asked Yang questions before he placed a pink jacket on her. Yang did not appear to understand the man’s questions.
 


The video that was posted on Friday prompted public anger, demanding action from the authorities. The hashtag “Official Announcement Regarding the Circumstances of the Xuzhou Woman with Eight Kids” received over 190 million views and more than 56,000 comments, as of this writing. Many netizens reportedly spoke out against women’s abuse and trafficking as well as questioned local authorities. Some also compared Yang’s situation to a 2007 Chinese film “Blind Mountain,” which is about a woman who is kidnapped and sold into slavery, according to BBC.

Feng County authorities have since responded to the issue explaining that Yang had married her husband Mr. Dong in 1998 and developed violent behaviors due to her diagnosed mental illness. Her illness reportedly led to the decision to separate her from her family, leaving her chained in the shed. The officials informed the public that the Women’s Federation will provide assistance to the family “to ensure they will have a warm Spring Festival.”

Authorities, however, have failed to address Yang’s detainment, which had led to more public outrage from netizens. Many have reportedly questioned the use of chains and the fact that a mentally ill woman has eight children. According to BBC, the online discussion was heavily censored as authorities censored the topic phrase ""Xuzhou Eight Children"" and removed posts discussing human trafficking.

“Do you even treat this woman as a human being?” one comment read, as translated by What's on Weibo.

Manya Koetse, the editor-in-chief of What's on Weibo, also shared a clip of Yang's husband and her children on Twitter with the caption: “Meanwhile, the husband is proudly talking about their 8 kids (7 boys, 1 girl), youngest still a baby. This is what the online anger is also about: how could she even have babies while suffering from mental illness? When did she become this way? Was she used as a breeding machine?”
  And also: how is this all legal? More to come on this as the case is allegedly being investigated now. According to one female National People Congress member (private Weibo account), the woman has been sent to a hospital and kids are being relocated. No official statements yet. pic.twitter.com/7CcB2nhTfl  — Manya Koetse (@manyapan) January 30, 2022    According to BBC, Yang was recently diagnosed with schizophrenia and has been admitted to a hospital for treatment. Her children were taken into state care. The officials are currently investigating the law violations of Mr. Dong.  Public outrage from netizens continues online with many calling on local authorities to take on greater responsibility.  ""She is a person, not an object,” a netizen wrote, according to BBC. “After having eight children over 20 years, she is only to be found today? None of the government departments and judicial bodies involved are innocent.”  Featured Images via @manyapan Enjoy this content? Read more from NextShark!

2/3/2022,"NEW YORK — Actress Susan Sarandon in an eyebrow-raising tweet has called into question the need for police in New York City — and she did it by reposting a message likening cops at the funeral for fallen Officer Jason Rivera to fascists. Sarandon posted to Twitter at 5:53 p.m. Tuesday as thousands of cops and New Yorkers gathered at St. Patrick’s Cathedral for the wake for slain NYPD Officer Wilbert Mora. Her tweet included a repost of a picture of a sea of uniformed cops filling Fifth Avenue for the funeral for Mora’s partner Rivera last week. “I’m gonna tell me kids this is what fascism looks like,” the headline on the original tweet reads. “So, if all these cops weren’t needed for CRIME that day, doesn’t that mean they aren’t needed ANY day,” a headline in Sarandon’s post over the retweeted photo reads. Sarandon has been critical of the NYPD in the past. “Shame on you,” she tweeted at former Mayor Bill de Blasio in 2020 after he lauded the NYPD for “tremendous restraint overall” during the George Floyd protests. The city Department of Investigation later blasted police for excessive force during a number of the protests — and de Blasio apologized for how the NYPD dealt with protesters. Sarandon was arrested in March 1999 outside One Police Plaza, where protesters gathered for weeks pf civil disobedience after an unarmed street vendor, Amadou Diallo, was shot dead by cops at his Bronx building. ———",U.S./NY Daily News,Actress Susan Sarandon retweets message comparing cops at funeral for fallen NYPD Officer Jason Rivera to ‘fascists’,https://news.yahoo.com/actress-susan-sarandon-retweets-message-180100853.html

John Kennedy wants Biden’s Supreme Court nominee to know ‘a law book from a J.

2/3/2022,"Susan Collins said it might be hard for Republicans to reject a Black, female Supreme Court nominee. She acknowledged that Democrats ""have had some success"" with painting the GOP as ""anti-Black."" Collins is one of few Republican senators who may vote in favor of Biden's nominee. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said this week that it might be difficult for Republicans to reject a Black, female Supreme Court nominee because of the political implications. ""The idea that race and gender should be the No. 1 and No. 2 criteria is not as it should be,"" Collins told The New York Times. ""On the other hand, there are many qualified Black women for this post and given that Democrats, regrettably, have had some success in trying to paint Republicans as anti-Black, it may make it more difficult to reject a Black jurist."" Collins is one of few Republicans who could vote in favor of Biden's nominee. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham also recently told Politico he supports President Joe Biden's decision to tap a Black woman for the Supreme Court. But other Republicans, like Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, have vehemently opposed it and characterized Biden's pledge as ""offensive."" ""The fact that he's willing to make a promise at the outset, that it must be a Black woman, I got to say that's offensive,"" Cruz recently said on his podcast. He also went on to say that Biden's Supreme Court pick ""is actually an insult to Black women,"" despite the fact that Biden's hasn't nominated anyone yet. The president is currently weighing who to tap as a successor to Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, who announced his upcoming retirement from the bench last week. Biden pledged during the 2020 presidential campaign that he would nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court and has had record success in getting his judicial nominees confirmed by the Senate. In his first year in office, he's had 40 nominees confirmed to the federal bench. That's more than any president since Ronald Reagan: Bill Clinton and George W. Bush each got 23 appointments their first year, Barack Obama secured 13, and Donald Trump got 19. Biden has also had little trouble achieving his goals of diversfying the federal judiciary. According to a recent report from the Alliance for Justice, before Biden took office, women of color made up 20% of the US population but just 4% of sitting federal judges. Almost half of Biden's nominees and more than half of all his women nominees are women of color, the report said. The media and public have speculated at length about who Biden might nominate for the Supreme Court, and although the White House hasn't dropped any hints, some have stood out as being on the shortlist. The top two contenders are Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who sits on the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger. Jackson, 51, is widely seen as the frontrunner for the nomination. She previously clerked for Breyer, and Collins, Graham, and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski all voted to confirm to the DC appeals court, which is considered to be the second most powerful court in the country.

2/3/2022,"A parent in Texas called for a children's book about former first lady Michelle Obama be pulled from schools, NBC News reported. The parent said the book unfairly depicted Donald Trump as a bully and would make white girls feel ""ashamed."" Books depicting race, sexuality, and gender, have become the target of conservatives who say the topics should stay out of schools. A parent in Texas called for a children's biography about former first lady Michelle Obama to be pulled from school libraries because they viewed it as unfair to former President Donald Trump. The Katy, Texas, parent took issue with a book titled ""Michelle Obama: Political Icon"" by Heather E. Schwartz, claiming it ""unfairly"" depicted Trump ""as a bully,"" according to NBC News, which on Wednesday published a list of 50 books that parents in Texas have asked schools to remove. The request came as books depicting race, sexuality, and gender have faced heightened scrutiny from conservatives in the US, with many demanding certain titles be pulled from school libraries. The parent in Katy, who was not named in NBC's report, said the book about Michelle Obama gave the impression that ""if you sound like a white girl you should be ashamed of yourself,"" NBC News reported. In a statement to Insider, Schwartz said she was ""shocked"" that someone wanted to ban her book because it ""is a nonfiction book that doesn't strike me as at all controversial."" Maria Corrales DiPetta, a spokesperson for the Katy Independent School District, told Insider the district reviewed the book after the complaint and determined it would not be removed. Any book that is challenged is reviewed by the district, even if only one parent submits a complaint, she said. ""We could have gotten hundreds of requests, and it would have gone through the same process,"" she added. In December, Katy ISD began pulling books from the shelves after parents complained about their vulgarity, the Houston Chronicle reported. ""The Board of Trustees and I stand by this policy and firmly believe that there is no place for books that contain pervasively vulgar content in Katy ISD libraries,"" Superintendent Ken Gregorski said at the time. ""It is our expectation that books within our collections are age appropriate for the students and families we serve,"" Gregorski added. Similar efforts have gained traction from state legislators and other community leaders in the US. Late last year, a state legislator in Oklahoma proposed a bill that would've prohibited books in school libraries that depicted sexual activity or discussions around sexuality and gender identity, The New York Times reported. In October last year, a Wyoming prosecutor declined a request to prosecute library employees in one conservative town for stocking several books about sex education and others with LGBTQ+ themes, The Associated Press reported. ""As an author, a reader, and a parent, I'm against book banning on principle,"" Schwartz, the author of the Obama biography, said. ""There couldn't be a safer way for kids to learn about difficult topics, gain new perspectives, and explore the world and their place in it than by reading words on a page.""

2/3/2022,"For the first time, the Tennessee Senate on Wednesday voted to expel a senator, stripping Sen. Katrina Robinson of her elected position following her federal conviction on federal wire fraud charges. Robinson, D-Memphis, had decried the Senate's move as racist and misogynistic and called the expulsion a ""procedural lynching"" Wednesday. The senator grew emotional on the Senate floor before her colleagues voted to expel her, calling the decision a foregone conclusion and the Senate's debate ""a show."" ""I was raised in a very no-nonsense manner. I’ve gone two years and never let the public see me cry,"" Robinson said. ""I continued to push through this ordeal to get here every week for session, for committee, to get back to my community even when I couldn’t raise money because people thought I was a thief. ""I went in my own pocket to give to kids who were looking forward to events that normally I would have support for. I stood out front this whole time, and I haven’t shied away from any fight, and I can’t do it here. Some of you think I would maintain my dignity through resignation, but for me the only way to maintain my dignity is to stand here and stand up for myself, and anyone else who would go through this."" The Senate voted 27-5 to expel her from the Senate. “While the expulsion of a Senator for the first time in history was not something any of us wished to see, it was a necessary action,"" Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, R-Oak Ridge, said in a statement following the vote. ""The integrity of the Senate is of paramount importance. Senator Robinson was given every consideration and due process."" McNally said the Senate could have acted right away following her conviction but gave her time to pursue her legal case. The Senate delayed action to allow her ""time to reflect and resign,"" he said. ""She declined that opportunity,"" McNally said. He called Wednesday a ""sad day for the Senate."" Robinson previously said prosecutors unfairly targeted and pursued her on trumped up charges, which are unrelated to her role in the Tennessee General Assembly. Robinson was initially charged with 48 counts in connection with her ownership of a nursing school and its management of federal grant funds. More: Sen. Katrina Robinson expulsion: What we know More: Ethics panel finds probable cause for Sen. Katrina Robinson's removal from legislature The prosecution's case did crumble in part through Robinson's trial last year, with the charges dropping to five during trial. A jury found Robinson guilty of four charges related to less than $3,500. Last month, a federal judge acquitted her of two of the charges, but upheld the remaining two and declined her request for a new trial. ""I refuse to resign because I do not want to succumb to the narrative that has been put out in the media and that you all have been swayed by,” Robinson said before the Senate vote. “I am not guilty of a crime, and I maintain that.” In January, she unsuccessfully fought to delay a Senate ethics committee vote until after her final sentencing, set for March. Robinson said she would resign following final sentencing, if she was still in office. After the vote, Robinson told reporters she didn't expect to win over any Republican colleagues with a ""last-minute floor speech."" ""I knew the day that I received that letter from the ethics committee that they were going to go there,"" Robinson said. ""Why? Because they have a history of wielding their power to do things, just like this: Unconstitutional, against the will of the people and just because they can."" Sen. Ferrell Haile, R-Gallatin, defended the Senate's process on Wednesday, noting Robinson served through multiple regular and special sessions while her case moved through the courts. ""[The Senate] chose to wait through the judicial process. The committee has given deference to court proceedings and Sen. Robinson in this matter,"" Haile said. He said the Senate ethics panel only moved forward after Robinson's request for a full acquittal or new trial was denied by a federal judge in January. Senate Democrats pushed Wednesday to delay the expulsion vote until after Robinson's sentencing. The motion failed on an unusual tie vote, with Sen. Brenda Gilmore, D-Nashville, absent Wednesday due to illness. “If removal occurs today, that’s something that cannot be undone,” Sen. Raumesh Akbari, D-Memphis, said. “We as a body will have removed a member based on something that was not final and not true. I don’t want that on my conscience.” Democrats pointed to a 2019 opinion from Attorney General Herbert Slatery, who found there is “no historical precedent of expelling a member other than for conduct that occurred while the member was in office.” Slatery released the opinion in reference to Rep. David Byrd, who face repeated calls for his resignation after three women said he sexually assaulted them when he was their high school basketball coach in the 1980s. In Byrd’s case, the assault accusations had been made public when he was reelected, and Slatery noted the conduct “was known to the member’s constituents” at the time of election. Byrd weathered the calls for resignation, despite apologizing to one of his accusers, though he has said he will not seek reelection again. More: The Tennessee House expelled a member by resolution in 1980. Will they do it again? Slatery said while there is no historical precedent, policy doesn’t prohibit the legislature expelling members for conduct occurring before their public service. He cautioned legislators should use expulsion power “only in extreme circumstances and with extreme caution.” In her defense on Wednesday, Robinson went through a list of unnamed lawmakers who face current or previous criminal charges or scandals. Robinson referenced Sen. Brian Kelsey, R-Germantown, who is awaiting federal trial on campaign finance charges, and Sen. Joey Hensley, R-Hohenwald, who faced domestic violence allegations and was professionally disciplined by Tennessee's medical board over unethical opioid prescriptions. More: Tennessee Sen. Joey Hensley put on medical probation for unethical opioid prescriptions ""We throw around this term moral turpitude,"" Robinson said. ""I ask this body, What are your moral values?'"" Robinson's expulsion from the Senate is the upper chamber's first. In 2016, a bipartisan House vote expelled Rep. Jeremy Durham, R-Franklin, over sexual misconduct allegations. He was accused of inappropriate conduct with at least 22 women while serving in the lower chamber. More: Jeremy Durham expelled from Tennessee House in 70-2 vote The House previously expelled Rep. Robert Fisher in 1980 over a bribery allegation. The Senate in 2006 voided the election of Ophelia Ford, also a Memphis Democrat, over voting discrepancies in a special election. Ford later went on to win election and serve. Eddie Weeks, the legislative librarian, said this week other than two failed or withdrawn attempts to expel senators in the late 19th century, there has been no Senate expulsion in the available legislative record from the Civil War onward. McNally and other Senate staff have said it is the first ever. Reach Melissa Brown at mabrown@tennessean.com. Want to read more stories like this?

2/3/2022,"CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — An Iran-flagged supertanker carrying more than 2 million barrels of condensate has docked at a Venezuelan port, with both countries facing U.S. sanctions, according to analysts and satellite images analyzed by The Associated Press. The arrival of the oil tanker Starla comes as negotiations continue in Vienna over the Islamic Republic's tattered nuclear deal with world powers, which allowed for oil sales. In 2018, the U.S. unilaterally withdrew from the accord under then President Donald Trump, sparking years of tensions across the wider Mideast that continue today. The Starla arrived off the coast of Barcelona, Venezuela, in late January. A satellite photo analyzed by AP from Planet Labs PBC showed the vessel there Sunday and corresponded to other images of the vessel and its helipad. Its dimensions also matched those of the Starla, which is owned by National Iranian Tanker Co. The U.S. Treasury sanctioned the company in October 2020, saying it helped fund the expeditionary Quds Force of Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. The Starla represents the first known condensate shipment of 2022 from Iran to arrive in Venezuela as part of a relationship between the two oil-exporting nations that are both under American sanctions. Iranian state media has not acknowledged the Starla's arrival in Venezuela after earlier trumpeting other shipments. Iran's mission to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment. Samir Madani, co-founder of TankerTrackers.com, said the ship is carrying 2.1 million barrels of a very light form of oil based on natural gas that Venezuela’s state-owned company uses to dilute its heavy crude oil to turn into an exportable blend. Madani said the vessel departed Iran on Dec. 11 and turned off its mandatory Automated Identification System for more than a month and a half. The system is used to prevent collisions, but companies in recent years have adopted a number of techniques, including turning it off, to evade detection as the U.S. has expanded economic sanctions. Iran maintains close ties to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and has shipped gasoline and other products to the country amid a U.S. sanctions campaign. Madani said vessels carried condensate from Iran to Venezuela four other times since 2020, bringing in more than 8.3 million barrels. Claire Jungman, the chief of staff at the New York-based group United Against Nuclear Iran who also tracks Iranian oil shipments, similarly identified the Starla from satellite images. Jungman said her organization had tracked an uptick in covert Iranian oil sales to China and Venezuela that she described as the countries “seeing how far they can push the Biden administration.” “If the U.S. is going to just keep letting them slide by … Iran is going to keep stalling,” Jungman said. “They are getting what they want by the lack of enforcement on sanctions.” ___ Associated Press writer Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.",World/Associated Press,Iranian supertanker carrying condensate docks in Venezuela,https://news.yahoo.com/iranian-tanker-carrying-condensate-docks-195330348.html
