1/24/2022,"BRUSSELS (AP) — NATO said Monday that it’s putting extra forces on standby and sending more ships and fighter jets to eastern Europe, as Ireland warned that new Russian war games off its coast are not welcome given tensions over whether President Vladimir Putin intends to attack Ukraine. The U.S.-led military organization said that it is beefing up its “deterrence” presence in the Baltic Sea area. Denmark is sending a frigate and deploying F-16 war planes to Lithuania; Spain will also send warships and could send fighter jets to Bulgaria; and France stands ready to send troops to Romania. Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said NATO will “take all necessary measures to protect and defend all allies.” He said: ""We will always respond to any deterioration of our security environment, including through strengthening our collective defense.” The announcement came as European Union foreign ministers sought to put on a fresh display of resolve in support of Ukraine, and paper over concerns about divisions on the best way to confront any Russian aggression. “We are showing unprecedented unity about the situation in Ukraine, with the strong coordination with the U.S.,” EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, who is chairing their meeting, told reporters in Brussels. Asked whether the EU would follow a U.S. move and order the families of European embassy personnel in Ukraine to leave, Borrell said: “We are not going to do the same thing.” He said he is keen to hear from Secretary of State Antony Blinken about that decision. Britain on Monday also announced it is withdrawing some diplomats and dependants from its embassy in Kyiv. The Foreign Office said the move was “in response to the growing threat from Russia.” Ukraine's foreign ministry spokesman, Oleg Nikolenko, said the U.S. decision was “a premature step” and a sign of “excessive caution.” He said that Russia is sowing panic among Ukrainians and foreigners in order to destabilize Ukraine. Germany is monitoring developments, but German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock stressed that “we must not contribute to unsettling the situation further; we need to continue to support the Ukrainian government very clearly and above all maintain the stability of the country.” Arriving at the EU meeting, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said he would inform his counterparts that Russia plans to holds war games 240 kilometers (150 miles) off Ireland’s southwest coast — in international waters but within Ireland's exclusive economic zone. “This isn’t a time to increase military activity and tension in the context of what’s happening with and in Ukraine.” Coveney said. “The fact that they are choosing to do it on the western borders, if you like, of the EU, off the Irish coast, is something that in our view is simply not welcome and not wanted right now, particularly in the coming weeks.” During Monday’s meeting, which Blinken will attend virtually, the ministers will restate Europe’s condemnation of the Russian military build-up near Ukraine, involving an estimated 100,000 troops, tanks, artillery and heavy equipment, diplomats and officials said ahead of the meeting. They’ll renew calls for dialogue, notably through the European-backed “Normandy format,” which helped to ease hostilities in 2015, a year after Putin ordered the annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula. Fighting in eastern Ukraine has killed around 14,000 people and still simmers today. Should Putin move on Ukraine again, the ministers will warn, Russia would face “massive consequences and severe costs.” Those costs would be of a financial and political nature. The EU insists that it stands ready to slap hefty sanctions on Russia within days of any attack. Over the weekend, some of the member countries closest to Russia — Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — confirmed that they plan to send U.S.-made anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine, a move endorsed by the United States. But questions have been raised about just how unified the EU is. Diverse political, business and energy interests have long divided the 27-country bloc in its approach to Moscow. Around 40% of the EU’s natural gas imports come from Russia, much of it via pipelines across Ukraine. Gas prices have skyrocketed, and the head of the International Energy Agency has said that Russian energy giant Gazprom was already reducing its exports to the EU in late 2021 despite high prices. Putin says Gazprom is respecting its contract obligations, not putting the squeeze on Europe. The EU’s two major powers appear most cautious. Germany’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia, which is complete but yet to pump gas, has become a bargaining chip. French President Emmanuel Macron has renewed previously rejected calls for an EU summit with Putin. Late last year, France and Germany initially expressed doubts about U.S. intelligence assessments that Moscow might be preparing to invade. Late on Saturday, the head of the German navy, Vice Admiral Kay-Achim Schoenbach, resigned after coming under fire for saying that Ukraine would not regain the Crimean Peninsula, and for suggesting that Putin deserves “respect.” Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban plans to meet with Putin next week to discuss a Russian-backed project to expand a Hungarian nuclear power plant. Still, diplomats and officials said hard-hitting sanctions are being drawn up with the EU’s executive branch, the European Commission. But they were reluctant to say what the measures might be or what action by Russia might trigger them. The aim, they said, is to try to match the doubts Putin has sowed about his intentions for Ukraine with uncertainty about what any retaliatory European action might look like, or when it would come. ___ This story has been updated to correct that France has said it is ready to send troops to Romania, not Bulgaria. ___ Associated Press writer Yuras Karmanau in Kyiv, Ukraine, and Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed.",World/Associated Press,"NATO sends ships, jets east as Ireland rejects Russia drills",https://news.yahoo.com/eu-set-show-unity-russia-083219922.html
1/24/2022,"A meat supplier told Fox the company has up to $30,000 of meat stocked in freezers. The Omicron variant has deterred guests from eating at restaurants, the owner said. Rising inflation and harsh winter storms have also caused order cancellations, he told Fox. A Chicago meat supplier has up to $30,000 worth of product stocked in freezers because of COVID-19's impact on the hospitality industry, Fox Business reported Sunday. Andrew Neva, owner of the Northwest Meat Company in Chicago, told Fox that steakhouses have canceled their orders with his firm as the Omicron variant of the coronavirus has kept guests away from restaurants. Neva told Fox that he bought about between $25,000 and $30,000 worth of meat in October — before the Omicron variant hit the US — when restaurant demand was much higher. When the Omicron variant started spreading late last year, high-end steakhouses, which are popular settings for special events during the holidays, scrapped their orders with Northwest Meat Company because guests were cancelling bookings, Neva told Fox. ""Any of the product I bought for that high-end market is still on my shelf,"" he told Fox, adding ""as a result, now I'm sitting on all this product that I still haven't gotten paid on."" Neva told Fox that inflation and winter storms across the northeast have also possibly played a role in the meat order cancellations. Insider has reached out to Northwest Meat Company for comment.

Mike Aguilar, Costa Mesa .. To the editor: Long before COVID-19 appeared, I was admitted to a local hospital because I couldn't breathe. Being told that you need open-heart surgery to replace you aortic valve is not pleasant. But it soon became evident that my survival would depend on my willingness to accept help and do what was required. I soon learned that I needed to form a partnership with my doctors, none of whom I had met before. These skilled medical personnel scheduled tests, offered detailed explanations and described the parameters of my treatment. I asked many questions. By the time of surgery, I was acutely aware of the partnership that forms between a patient, a family and their healthcare workers. Our trust resulted in a successful, life-changing procedure for me. My late brother was a pulmonologist. I watched him and his fellow medical school graduates stand and take the oath to ""first, do no harm.""

1/24/2022,"A Chinese teenager's search for his parents and subsequent rejection has drawn national scrutiny. He said he was sold by his parents as a baby, and that his adoptive parents died when he was 4. On Monday, local police said he took his own life after his birth parents rejected him. A teen reportedly died by suicide after his search for his birth parents went viral on social media and they rejected him. Liu Xuezhou took his own life at a beach in Sanya, a city in Hainan province, the teenager's aunt Chai Mou told Chinese media. Sanya police confirmed his death to the Chinese outlet The Paper. Liu's story first came to national attention when he posted a video on December 6 asking for help finding his biological family. The teen said in the video he was born between 2004 and 2006 in Hebei province and was sold by his biological parents to his adoptive parents when he was three months old. Liu's biological mother, identified by Chinese outlets only as Ms. Zhang, disputes this. She told The Paper that they planned on giving their son away and not selling him, but that the middleman who sold Liu to his adoptive parents insisted on gifting them money. According to Liu, his adoptive parents died in a fireworks accident when he was 4. Liu said he then lived with his grandparents — the parents of his adoptive mother — and received child support from his grandparents on his adoptive father's side. Liu said last year that he was working part-time to pay for his studies at a vocational school and was scraping by. Last week, he posted a photo of a dilapidated house, claiming it was where he stayed. As his request for information gathered steam online, police from his home region found his biological father through DNA testing. On December 27, the teen met his dad in Shijiazhuang, the capital of Hebei, according to Sina News. But Liu said his father refused to take him in because he was already raising another family. In early January, Liu said he found his biological mother in Inner Mongolia and traveled to meet her. Like his father, she rejected the teen, saying she just ""wanted a peaceful life"" and had her own family, Beijing News reported. According to Beijing News, Liu's biological parents pooled their money and sent him on vacation to Sanya. Liu accepted the trip but continued to ask his parents to help with his housing. They both refused the request, the teen said on Weibo. He said his mother then blocked his number and social media accounts, calling him a ""white-eyed wolf,"" a Chinese term used to describe someone who is ungrateful, cold-hearted, and cruel. Zhang told The Paper that she blocked Liu because he kept asking her to buy him a house, which she said couldn't afford. Liu's father, who the outlet identified as Ding Mou, also claimed that Liu had asked him to buy a house for him. However, Liu disputed this on Weibo and said he had only asked that his parents help him cover rent. Liu said last week that he was bombarded with messages from critics and internet trolls. As of Monday, Weibo discussions of Liu's death, search, and relationship with his parents had amassed more than 150 million views, and Liu had accumulated more than 160,000 followers. Most Weibo users supported his campaign and condemned his parent's decision to give him up as a baby (child trafficking or abduction in China is punishable by up to 10 years in prison). Two prominent lawyers, Zhou Zhaocheng, who regularly covers cases regarding cyberviolence, and Guo Gangtang, who specializes in reuniting trafficked children with their parents, also spoke out in support of Liu. On January 19, Liu announced on Weibo that he planned to sue both of his parents. ""Originally, I thought about your children and gave up on this. But now I see you have confused black from white and can't recognize your own misdeeds,"" he wrote. Then on Sunday night, he posted what appeared to be a suicide note to the platform, inciting panic among his followers. ""In the past couple of days, there have been people attacking and cursing me on Douyin and Weibo,"" he wrote in the 10,000-word note. ""I have endured being called many types of curses, like 'scheming son of a bitch,' 'go and die quickly,' 'disgusting,' and 'sissy.'"" He added that he'd been ""abandoned twice by his biological parents."" But Liu's mother denied she abandoned her son. ""Since the start, we didn't have the financial ability; now we don't have that ability,"" she said in an interview with The Paper on January 20. ""He's pressuring us to buy him a house without caring if we live or die. His parents are also heartbroken.""

1/24/2022,"Reports over the weekend suggest that US President Biden is going to introduce an Executive Order for cryptocurrencies at the beginning of February. The order is expected to span across government and plans to weigh-up the benefits and disadvantages of digital assets, alongside implementing a reporting system for government on cryptocurrencies. Officials are yet to confirm the rumour. What has been confirmed is that there have been several top-level meetings with senior figures at the White House relating to the subject, and it is speculated further details are expected to be outlined by Biden next week. White House pundits have suggested there may be an additional focus on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) as a component of the directive, which would seek to clarify the American government’s position following the quick rise of the Chinese digital Yuan. The tumultuous passage of a tack-on crypto tax to the infrastructure deal last Summer has left a bad taste in the industry’s mouth, and created a sentiment that Democrat policymaking under Biden views crypto as a ‘cash cow’. Needless to say, many will be looking at the tone of any strategic plan put forward by Biden carefully. But things are different down on K Street this year, with the crypto lobby now awake and active – emboldened by a growing awareness and advocacy for cryptocurrencies among the public and legislators. The Hill also now has an increasingly prominent Blockchain Caucus – one that has already put forward 35 crypto-related bills this congress. Congressman Tom Emmer, explained the ongoing work of the Congressional body in a recent interview. “In wake of the Infrastructure bill fiasco and misguided crypto tax amendment, key members on these committees spoke out and supported legislative fixes,” explained the congressman. “There are several bipartisan, industry supported proposals on the table… but, we have yet to see anything pass out of Congress and get signed into law. “We will very likely see this change after the midterms, so it’s more important than ever to start preparing our agenda for the next term.”",Politics/Coin Rivet,President Biden plans Executive Order for cryptocurrencies in February,https://news.yahoo.com/president-biden-plans-executive-order-111927265.html

1/24/2022,"Mary Trump, Donald Trump's niece, says he will ""stop protecting"" Ivanka Trump if it no longer benefits him. Trump said the former president will ""throw anybody under the bus"" if necessary. Ivanka Trump was asked by the January 6 panel last week to cooperate with their investigation. Former President Donald Trump's niece, author Mary Trump, said her uncle would ""stop protecting"" his daughter Ivanka if he thinks it is in his best interest. Speaking to MSNBC host Alex Witt on Sunday, Mary Trump said it was unlikely that Donald Trump would take any heat to shield his children. ""Donald isn't playing the card that she's his child to protect her. He's doing that to protect himself because he knows she may indeed have potentially damning information,"" Mary Trump said. She added that she thought her cousin Ivanka was likely making a ""calculation"" at this point about what will ""help her in the long run."" ""(Ivanka) knows she has to come down on the right side of things. Or, she'll continue to stay her father's ally, and have to see how that plays out,"" Mary Trump said. ""She's in a very bad situation because she must understand that if Donald feels it's necessary, he will stop protecting her."" ""Donald will throw anybody under the bus if he believes it's in his best interest to do so. If he believes it'll help play out the clock, if he believes that it will help him avoid accountability, that's all he cares about,"" Mary Trump said. Mary Trump also said that Ivanka Trump has information that the American people ""deserve"" and should voluntarily cooperate with the January 6 panel. ""She worked for the American people, not for her father,"" Mary Trump said. ""This is an adult human being. She's 40 years old. She has children of her own. So the whole 'she should be protected because she's his child' is absurd on its face. She owes the committee truthfulness about what happened that day."" Last week, the House Select Committee on January 6 asked Ivanka to voluntarily cooperate with its investigation into the Capitol riot. Rep. Bennie Thompson, the committee's chair, said in a letter that Ivanka Trump had direct contact with her father during the insurrection. After the letter's release, Trump blasted the January 6 committee for what he claimed was ""vicious"" targeting of his adult children. Separately, New York Attorney General Letitia James took legal action last week to compel Trump, Ivanka, and Donald Jr. to answer subpoenas related to an investigation into the Trump Organization. Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen said during a January 22 interview on MSNBC that there was no chance that Trump would try to protect his adult children from probes into the Trump organization or the January 6 riot at his own expense. ""Donald cares only about Donald, more than he would care about his children,"" Cohen said. However, Cohen added that Trump once told him that if one of the Trump children had to go to prison, to make sure it was Donald Trump Jr., his oldest son, and not Ivanka, because Don Jr. ""would be able to handle it.""

1/24/2022,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disabling disease of the central nervous system in which the immune system attacks the myelin sheath—a layer of fatty tissue and protein that protects nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord—causing communication problems between the brain and body. Eventually, this can cause nerve damage, resulting in a whole host of phantom pains and sensations. Historically, MS has been a condition that's shrouded in mystery and often met with dismissal or disbelief, but experts are now learning more about the disease. In fact, Harvard researchers have confirmed one underlying cause for MS. If you've done this one thing, they say your odds of developing the inflammatory condition are 32 times higher than if you haven't. Read on to find out what experts now say may in fact be the leading causes of MS, and how you can protect yourself against developing the condition. RELATED: Selma Blair Reveals the Early MS Sign She Didn't Know Was a Symptom. Read the original article on Best Life. Medical experts have long sought to understand the mechanics behind multiple sclerosis, which currently affects an estimated 2.8 million people worldwide. This week, researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health have published new findings in the journal Science stating that the majority of MS cases are associated with prior infection of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). ""The hypothesis that EBV causes MS has been investigated by our group and others for several years, but this is the first study providing compelling evidence of causality,"" Alberto Ascherio, MD, DrPH, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard Chan School and senior author of the study, said via press release. ""This is a big step because it suggests that most MS cases could be prevented by stopping EBV infection, and that targeting EBV could lead to the discovery of a cure for MS."" RELATED: This Was the First Sign of MS ""Sopranos"" Star Jamie-Lynn Sigler Noticed. Establishing causation between Epstein-Barr virus and MS was particularly difficult, especially given that EBV is extremely common, while MS remains relatively rare. To further complicate matters, the onset of MS symptoms typically begin roughly 10 years following an EBV infection, obscuring a direct connection. To probe the relationship between the two illnesses, the Harvard team studied more than 10 million young adults in the U.S. military, including 955 who were diagnosed with MS while serving in active duty. After analyzing serum samples taken periodically by the military, the team determined each subject's EBV status at time of their first sample and tracked the relationship between EBV and MS in those who developed symptoms while serving. Their findings were stark. ""The risk of MS increased 32-fold after infection with EBV but was unchanged after infection with other viruses,"" the team shared. ""Serum levels of neurofilament light chain, a biomarker of the nerve degeneration typical in MS, increased only after EBV infection. The findings cannot be explained by any known risk factor for MS and suggest EBV as the leading cause of MS,"" they add. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Epstein-Barr virus is a member of the herpes virus family, and is also known as human herpesvirus 4. It's considered extremely common, the health authority points out: Most people will experience an EBV infection at some point in their lives, most frequently during childhood when you're less likely to develop symptoms. The health authority estimates that between 90 and 95 percent of adults have antibodies indicating a current or past EBV infection. Symptoms of EBV—should they appear at all—most frequently include fatigue, fever, inflamed throat, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, enlarged spleen, swollen liver, or skin rash. Following an EBV infection, the virus becomes inactive in your body, but remains latent in the B memory cells. In those with weakened immune systems, the virus may later reactivate, explains the CDC. Epstein-Barr infects others through bodily fluids, most often via saliva. ""EBV can be spread by using objects, such as a toothbrush or drinking glass, that an infected person recently used. The virus probably survives on an object at least as long as the object remains moist,"" says the CDC. For this reason, the health authority suggests that you may be able to protect yourself ""by not kissing or sharing drinks, food, or personal items, like toothbrushes, with people who have EBV infection."" EBV is also known to be the most common cause of infectious mononucleosis (colloquially known as ""mono""), so you should take these precautions if you or someone you know has a known case of the virus. However, the researchers behind the Harvard study were less optimistic about your odds of intentionally avoiding EBV, instead focusing on the bigger picture opportunities that their findings may create. ""Currently there is no way to effectively prevent or treat EBV infection, but an EBV vaccine or targeting the virus with EBV-specific antiviral drugs could ultimately prevent or cure MS,"" said Ascherio. Thanks to their breakthrough, debilitating multiple sclerosis cases may someday become a thing of the past.
