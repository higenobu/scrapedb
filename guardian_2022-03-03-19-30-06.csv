3/3/2022,"Astained, lidless plastic container rests on electric weighing scales. Next to it sits a sunken, shredded man, his hands shaking as he holds the knife to carve the pound of flesh he is owed. In Abigail Graham’s brutal, lonely production of The Merchant of Venice, there is no question of who the victim is. Shylock, played heart-wrenchingly by Adrian Schiller, is repeatedly spat at and hounded by vulgar city boys who hide their actions behind the crosses round their necks. By the time we reach the infamous scene of revenge, Shylock’s bind to his oath seems just. These men have taken so much from him, it only seems fair for him to take something back. Shakespeare’s challenging text has been streamlined to a neat two hours in this contemporary production. Its innards have been snipped and significantly shuffled, so that we start with Launcelot (Aaron Vodovoz) switching allegiance from Shylock to Bassiano (Michael Marcus). Joining the toxic antisemitic boys while they’re out drinking, they make Launcelot do a shot every time he says the word “Jew”. Shylock’s devastating “If they prick us, do we not bleed?” speech is shifted powerfully to the end of the first half. The result is a production cleanly cut, sharply told. Jarring with Shylock’s bleak storyline are the glitzy scenes in search of Portia’s husband. These hammed-up sections are uncannily well suited to the style of noughties TV gameshows, but they feel cut from a different play until Bassanio leaps on to the golden podium. He and Portia (Sophie Melville) spark off each other, slinky and playful as she manipulates his choice towards the winning box. The chemistry between Nerissa (Tripti Tripuraneni) and Gratiano (Raymond Anum) is strong too, leading to a hilarious wedding scene where sweet dancing devolves into debauchery. The relationship between Shylock and his daughter Jessica (Eleanor Wyld) isn’t given enough stage time for their storyline to really wallop us, but the aesthetics and choices of the production’s final scene more than make up for it. Once Shylock has been stripped of the most meaningful part of his identity, the rest of the play is ripped right away, with any attempts to continue immediately drowned out. The impact is full-bodied. Jessica realises what really holds worth, and no room is left for anything else.

3/3/2022,"In his new book, Donald Trump’s former attorney general William Barr complains that in the US, the “most educated and influential people are more attached to self-serving narratives than to factual truth”. But in his own narrative of his tumultuous time as Trump’s top lawyer, Barr regularly omits inconvenient truths or includes self-serving versions of events previously reported with his evident input. Barr was only the second US attorney general to fill the role twice, working for George HW Bush from 1991 to 1993, then succeeding Jeff Sessions in 2019. His memoir, One Damn Thing After Another, will be published on 8 March. Excerpts have been reported by US news outlets. The Guardian obtained a copy. As widely reported, Barr defends himself from accusations that he was too close to Trump and acted to shield him over the Russia investigation and Robert Mueller’s final report on election interference and links between Trump and Moscow. He defends his decision to say Trump did not seek to obstruct justice during Mueller’s work, despite Mueller laying out 10 possible instances of such potentially criminal conduct. Barr also defends his decision to seek to dismiss charges against Michael Flynn and to lessen the sentence handed to Roger Stone, Trump allies convicted as a result of the Russia investigation. On other controversies, Barr’s accounts are often highly selective or noticeably incomplete. In June 2020, Barr was engulfed in controversy over the removal of Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney in the southern district of New York. Berman was investigating Trump’s business and allies including Rudy Giuliani. He was also supervising a case involving a Turkish bank which the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, pressured Trump to drop. Shortly after John Bolton, Trump’s third national security adviser, said Trump promised Erdoğan he would get rid of leaders in the southern district, Barr announced Berman was stepping down. When Berman said he would not quit, he was fired. The incident prompted calls for Barr to resign, including from the New York City Bar Association. In his book, Barr praises the “quality and experience of the group of US attorneys I inherited” and says he told them “to go full speed ahead on the department’s existing priorities”. He also says he regrets not installing an aide, Ed O’Callaghan, “into his dream job – US attorney in the southern district of New York”. But he does not mention Berman and how or why he fired him. Barr also defends his decision to restart federal executions after 17 years, which lead to 13 state killings in the final six months of Trump’s presidency. Barr describes, with apparent relish, the crimes of many of those killed. He does not mention Lisa Montgomery, the first woman executed by the federal government in 67 years, whose lawyers argued she had brain damage from beatings as a child and suffered from psychosis and other mental conditions, having been sexually abused. Barr also outlines why he thinks Trump lost the election and should not run again. His former boss’s volcanic anger is repeatedly described. Detailing Trump’s fury during protests against racial injustice outside the White House in June 2020 – after confirming that Trump was once hustled to a protective bunker, which Trump denied – Barr writes: “The president lost his composure. “Glaring around the semi-circle of officials in front of his desk, he swept his index finger around the semi-circle, pointing at all of us. ‘You’re all losers!’ he yelled, his face reddening … ‘You’re losers!’ he yelled again, tiny flecks of spit arcing to his desktop. ‘Fucking losers!’ It was a tantrum.” After that tantrum, peaceful protesters were violently cleared from Lafayette Square before Trump walked to a historic church to stage a photoshoot holding a Bible. Barr and other senior aides made the walk too. It was widely reported that Barr ordered the clearance. In his book, Barr says Trump told him to “take the lead” in dealing with the protesters. But he echoes an official report in saying the clearance was already planned by police. Barr portrays himself and other aides obstructing or defying Trump’s demands, including pressure to investigate Hunter Biden, Joe Biden’s son, and the contents of a laptop obtained by Giuliani. “I cut him off again,” Barr writes, “raising my voice. ‘Dammit, Mr President! I can’t talk about that, and I am not going to!’ “He was silent for a moment, then quickly got off the line.” Barr also gives space to his falling out with Trump over the president’s lie about electoral fraud in his defeat by Joe Biden – a rupture which happened after Barr controversially ordered the Department of Justice to investigate electoral fraud claims, a decision he now defends. A tempestuous meeting between Trump and Barr on 1 December 2021, at which the attorney general told the president no widespread fraud existed, has been widely reported. Such accounts do not say Barr attempted to resign. In his memoir, he says he did and that Trump accepted but was talked around. In his account of a meeting on 14 December 2020 at which he did resign, Barr says Trump first gave him a report which the president claimed contained “absolute proof that the Dominion machines were rigged [and] I won the election and will have a second term”. The House oversight committee released the report in June 2021, detailing how Trump sent it to Barr’s replacement, Jeffrey Rosen, shortly after Barr left his resignation meeting. But accounts of that meeting in books by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa (Peril) and Jonathan Karl (Betrayal), heavily informed by Barr, do not say Trump gave Barr the report and that Barr, in his own words, said he would look into it. The report was produced by Allied Security Operations Group (ASOG), which Barr says “described itself as a cybersecurity firm in Texas”, and purported to deal with events in Antrim county, Michigan, a Republican area where a clerking error appeared to give Biden victory before a Trump win was confirmed. The report, Barr writes, concluded that voting machines were “intentionally and purposefully designed with inherent errors to create systemic fraud and influence election results”. Barr calls the report “amateurish” and “sensational” and its conclusion “an ipse dixit, a bald claim without even the pretense of supporting evidence”. Dominion Voting Systems, the company which made the machines, has sued Trump allies including Giuliani, Mike Lindell and Fox News, seeking billions in damages. Trump has not commented on Barr’s book. But he has previously called his attorney general – who many saw as a ruthless “hatchet man”, determined to do the president’s bidding – “afraid, weak and frankly … pathetic”.",Arts/Books,William Barr’s Trump book: self-serving narratives and tricky truths ignored,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/03/william-barr-attorney-general-trump-book
3/3/2022,"In the late summer of 2020, Bruce Bartman went to Pennsylvania’s voter registration website and signed up his mother and mother-in-law to vote. Both women were dead. A few months later, Bartman, who is white, requested a mail-in ballot for his late mother and cast her vote for Donald Trump. Bartman was arrested that December and charged with perjury and unlawful voting. Months later, he pleaded guilty, admitted he made a “stupid mistake,” was sentenced to five years of probation and barred from serving on a jury or voting for four years. “There’s not public benefit to him being incarcerated,” Jack Stollsteimer, the local district attorney said at the time. “This defendant from the beginning has accepted responsibility for his actions, and he has paid the price for them.” When Bartman pleaded guilty, nearly 1,000 miles away, in Memphis, a Black Lives Matter activist named Pamela Moses was facing her own election-related criminal charges. A few years previously, Moses, who is Black, permanently lost the right to vote after committing a felony. But no one had actually removed Moses from the voter rolls or told her she couldn’t vote. And in 2019, when state officials began looking into her eligibility, a probation officer signed a certificate saying Moses had completed her sentence and was eligible to vote. So she applied to do so. Even though corrections officials conceded they made an error, Moses was indicted anyway. Moses was convicted by a jury in November. In late January, she was sentenced to six years and one day in prison Her sentence attracted widespread national scrutiny for its harshness – it is among the most severe for an election-related crime issued in recent memory. Following weeks of outcry and the introduction of new evidence revealed by the Guardian, a judge ordered a new trial for Moses last week. Despite that unusual reversal, the case also underscored what many experts see as a double standard in the US criminal justice system: white people face relatively light punishment for intentional cases of fraud, while Black people face tougher punishments for unintentional voting errors. No comprehensive data exists comparing voter fraud prosecutions based on race. It’s also difficult to compare prosecutions in different jurisdictions because a criminal sentence depends on many factors, including the discretion of the local prosecutor, state laws, the facts of the offense, and the defendant’s criminal history. But the experts say the cases that have come to prominence ring alarm bells. “This [Moses] conviction has resonated across the country, the world, and it certainly has resonated in this community. I would suggest that it certainly resonated with Black women who might wonder if they’re eligible to vote in the coming elections,” said Josh Spickler, the executive director of Just City, a criminal justice non-profit in Memphis. “It is what you think it is. It is voter suppression. It is a message to consider whether you should vote or not.” Moses’ case immediately attracted comparisons to the case of Crystal Mason, a Texas woman who was sentenced to five years in prison for voting while on federal supervised release – similar to probation – in 2016. Probation officials testified that they never told Mason she couldn’t vote, and her ballot was never counted, but a judge found her guilty of illegally voting anyway. An appeal is currently pending at Texas’ highest criminal court. Last summer, Texas officials also arrested Hervis Rogers, who is Black, for voting while on probation for a felony. Rogers, who received national attention after waiting seven hours in line to vote in 2020, also says didn’t know he was ineligible. His case is currently pending and he could face years in prison. “What we do see is that there’s a willingness to go after people who are making, at worst, innocent mistakes. That’s not what our justice system should be about,” said Thomas Buser-Clancy, a lawyer with the Texas chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union who is helping represent both Mason and Rogers. These relatively long sentences stand out even more given several recent examples in which white defendants who committed acts of fraud received no prison time at all. Last year, a 72-year old Republican voter in Pennsylvania was sentenced to probation after putting on sunglasses and trying to impersonate his son at the polls. In Arizona, a 64-year-old woman pleaded guilty to forging her deceased mother’s signature on a mail-in ballot; she was sentenced to probation and could face up to 90 days in jail when she’s sentenced in March. In Nevada, a Republican who voted using his dead wife’s ballot and then lied about it pleaded guilty and was sentenced to probation. And in 2018, about a month after Mason was sentenced, a white justice of the peace in the same county pleaded guilty to forging signatures to get on the ballot when he was running for office. He was sentenced to probation. “You have Ms. Mason’s case of what at worst is an innocent mistake…on the other hand you have someone who intentionally - you can’t innocently forge signatures, and they received probation,” said Buser-Clancy. “It’s the same county, same DA, very different results, when you would expect it to go the opposite way.” In Texas, the prosecutor who handled Mason’s case defended the harsh sentence by noting that she offered her a plea deal with probation. “Our office offered Mason the option of probation in this case, which she refused. She chose to have a trial by judge, and the judge found beyond a reasonable doubt from the evidence that she knew she wasn’t eligible to vote and voted anyway,” she said in 2019. Amy Weirich, the district attorney in Memphis who prosecuted Moses, also defended her handling of the case in part by noting that she offered Moses a plea deal that didn’t involve incarceration. “I gave her a chance to plead to a misdemeanor with no prison time,” Weirich said in a statement. “She requested a jury trial instead. She set this unfortunate result in motion and a jury of her peers heard the evidence and convicted her.” “It’s a fact for various reasons that people who go to trial generally get harsher sentences,” said Daniel Richman, a law professor at Columbia University who has written extensively about prosecutors. “Sometimes you hear arguments, and there’s some substance to them, that the prosecution is seeking to punish the defendant for going to trial, and I’m sure that happens. But another thing that always happens is the judge knows the case a lot better. And generally, when a judge knows a case a lot better, the defendant is worse off.” But the decision to reject a plea and go to trial, a constitutional right in the US, shouldn’t necessarily lead to a harsher sentence, experts say. For someone who already has a criminal record like Mason or Moses, accepting a plea deal for a new crime can have severe consequences, such as the revocation of probation or losing a job. “Why is it we have a system where a prosecutor can basically say to somebody, you plead, we’ll extend your probation. If you don’t plead, you’re facing six years. Does that sound like the kind of system we want?,” said Bennett Capers, a former federal prosecutor who now teaches law at Fordham University. “If [Moses] had taken the plea, nobody would have known about this case.” Prosecutors have also defended the sentences for Moses and Mason by pointing to their prior criminal records. But in the US, having a criminal conviction means navigating an enormously confusing set of rules in order to regain one’s vote, and such rules vary widely by state. Those confusing voting rules are more likely to affect Black Americans like Moses and Mason. Over one-fifth of Black people of voting age in Moses’ home state of Tennessee – nearly 175,000 people – can’t vote because of a felony conviction, according to an estimate by The Sentencing Project, a criminal justice non-profit. There is a stark racial disparity. Around 17% of Tennessee’s population is Black, but Black people account for around 40% of those disenfranchised because of a felony conviction in the state. Nationally, around 2.3% of the voting age population can’t vote because of a felony conviction. But it is 6.3% of Black Americans of voting age. “This is much more likely to have a disparate effect on people who are Black and brown. People who are Black and Brown are more likely to have a conviction,” Capers said. The Moses case “sort of sends a message that ‘you know, by the way, don’t think about going to the polls’”, Capers said.",News/US news,A white man got probation for voting fraud.

3/3/2022,"Every weekend for most of her youth, while other children were out playing, Natalia Toroshenko attended Ukrainian school, studying the country’s geography, language, its history and national heroes. “Ukraine, and being Ukrainian, is a deep part of me,” she said. “I wasn’t born there, but it’s my ancestral homeland.” Toroshenko grew up in Montreal, thousands of kilometres away from the country her father had left to flee famine and conflict. But, she like many other Ukrainian Canadians, has maintained strong connections to the country – and watched horrified as family and friends are trapped in war. Canada is home to 1.4 million people of Ukrainian descent – the world’s second largest Ukrainian diaspora after Russia. Tens of thousands of Ukrainians farmed the country’s west. The spires of their churches still dot rural landscapes and large cities. Prominent community leaders and politicians are of Ukrainian ancestry, including Canada’s deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland. Those cultural and political ties are particularly prominent in the Canadian Prairies, where generations Ukrainians have braided their culture and history into the vast landscape. In the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, hundreds of one room schoolhouses were once named after Ukrainian figures and communities. Nearly 30 towns and a handful of parks are named after places and people from Ukraine Vegreville, Alberta, where Toroshenko now lives, boasts one of the world’s largest pysankas – an intricately painted Ukrainian Easter egg weighing more than 5,500 pounds and drawing thousands of curious tourists each year. In recent weeks, a sombre mood has taken hold in the farming community . “Each morning on television I watch Kyiv getting bombed all over the place. I see images of Ukrainians taking up arms. Regular people, as young as 18, defending their country,” Toroshenko said. “It’s horrific.” As Ukrainian-Canadians pore over news accounts and social media the Russian invasion has also unearthed painful memories of their own family histories – many of which are marked by conflict, dispossession and exile. “My father chose to come here for a better life,” she said. “He wanted a place where he could be free and where if he worked hard, he and others could make something of themselves.” That history inspired Toroshenko to return the favor to her family’s homeland, traveling ten times to Ukraine as an elections observer. But as the war continues, she fears the democratic structures she and thousands of others helped establish over the years are under threat of collapse – as is the dream of what Ukraine could become. Canada’s deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland, who grew up in a tight-knit rural Ukrainian community in the Prairies, spoke last week to the country’s diaspora, offering words of hope. “When she spoke, she used the first line of the national anthem. She said ‘Ukraine has not yet perished,” said Toroshenko. “It was amazing to hear. It really resonated with us. It moved us.” Others have tried to shake off the sense of powerlessness, drawing instead on the tightness of the community. “Immigrating to Canada was hard for us, as it is for most people. But to be able to see ourselves in the Ukrainians who came before us was an inspiration. It showed us there was a place for us here – and a path for us to follow,” said Zoya Kostetsky, a Winnipeg-based artisan who moved from to Canada from the Ukrainian city of Lviv in 2005. She attended one of the ten English-Ukrainian bilingual schools in the province and found a strong cultural network to help her settle in Canada: “We found a sense of community. They spoke the language, they followed the same traditions and celebrated the same holidays.” As she stood with her family at a recent rally against the war, she was struck by how the grief she felt was shared across the crowd. “Everyone was suffering. Everyone had someone they were worried about. And in a grim way, it made it easier.” Desperate to help in some way, she organized a raffle with prizes from local businesses, and raised more than C$20,000 to aid in relief efforts. But the knowledge that if her family hadn’t left, they too would be facing the prospect of fighting in the war has left a heavy mark on her. “My dad is still young enough to be in the military, so he would be in the war. I would be in the war. My mom is a medic, so she would be doing medical work in the war. My brother would be in the war,” she said. “Our whole family would be fighting on the frontlines.” The funds she has raised have gone to help both citizens fighting and those fleeing to neighboring countries, and Kostetsky said the gratitude from aid groups in Ukraine – and the overwhelming support of the broader community around her, have kept her motivated. “I’ll keep doing what I can every day until this is over,” she said. “Because until then I won’t be able to relax at all. I can’t just sit back and watch as this country gets destroyed.”",News/World news,"In Canada, world’s second largest Ukrainian diaspora grieves invasion",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/canada-ukraine-diaspora-relief-efforts-russia-attack
3/3/2022,"For Nina, the prospect of walking into a police station and reporting her stepfather for child sexual abuse was, she says, her “worst nightmare ... It was something I’d dreaded my whole life,” she says. She had been raped by her stepfather for years when she was a child – and he had promised all sorts of consequences if she ever told anyone. Her mother, he told her, would kill herself. He implied that he might, too – but one thing he always assured her was that he would never go to jail. When she was in her late teens, Nina finally told her mum, who was devastated, but believed her. It took years, however, before she felt ready to press charges. “One of the things that stopped me from telling anyone that it was happening at the time was the terror of standing in a courtroom putting all that shame on show – and that felt even worse the older I got. “It took a good few years before I realised that the right thing to do was to prosecute. It had got to the point where ‘little Nina’ would have wanted it to happen; I felt like I was doing it for my childhood self and for all the other little Ninas out there who were still suffering. I had a duty beyond any pain it would cause me – but I had no clue of the price I’d be paying.” Nina made the report in 2016. She subsequently gave a detailed video interview with the police. “It felt good to get it done,” she says. Rather than “overwhelm” her with continual contact, the police suggested they only get in touch when there was progress on the case. “I thought that sounded all right, but then you wait six months, eight months, 10 months, without hearing anything,” says Nina. “What’s going on? You start to wonder: is it OK? Is anything happening? Are they investigating?” At times, it felt almost as if the move that had seemed so momentous, that had taken all of Nina’s courage, had made no mark or had never happened. “I had no paperwork, not a single letter, nothing at all to show it was on record or in the system other than a crime number that was dictated to me down the phone at some point,” she says. “The thing that horrifies me is that at the start of each new year, I think, ‘OK, maybe this year, it’ll all be over, something will happen and I can finally put it behind me and get on with my life’ – but it never is. It has been five years now with the police and CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] ping-ponging the case between each other. My stepfather is still living his life without consequences and we haven’t even got to a charging decision. “It casts a shadow over everything I plan, any choice I make, this feeling that something could happen any time so I have to keep it all top of my mind when all my instincts are telling me not to. My testimony is relying on the fact that I’m remembering something that I’m desperately trying to forget.” Figures for England and Wales have shown the typical delay between an offence of rape and a resulting criminal case rose to 1,000 days in 2021. According to the Criminal Bar Association, the backlog of trials for sexual offences has risen by 125% in the past three years. This, of course, shows only the tip of the iceberg, since a fraction of reported sex offences will get to trial – 2.9% resulted in charges in the year to September 2021, according to figures released by the Home Office. (The prosecution rate for rape cases is even lower, at 1.3%.) The 1,000-day wait doesn’t count survivors like Nina, whose case has been languishing for almost double that. The pandemic is often cited as a cause, but multiple factors have played a part here. “In some ways, Covid feels like a convenient excuse,” says Francesca Jarvis from Rape Crisis South London. “The system was already buckling.” According to Jarvis, these waiting times are the result of a “perfect storm”. At the legal end, we’ve had a decade of court closures, the defunding of criminal legal aid and the growing shortage of barristers. At investigation stage, the case of Liam Allan at the end of 2017, where a rape trial collapsed because crucial mobile phone evidence had been withheld from the defence, has led to a level of caution in police and CPS that, Jarvis says, “completely changed the landscape”. Kate Ellis, a solicitor with Centre for Women’s Justice, agrees that the impact of this case on waiting times is “hard to overstate”. It tapped into fears around sexual offences and false allegations, and the police and CPS really came under fire. “Many believe the pendulum quickly swayed too far in the other direction, as investigations now seem very focused on the victim’s credibility, on the police and CPS proactively gathering evidence that may assist the defence – health records, phone records, there’s a huge volume of evidence in a digital age. It has raised difficult questions about where to stop.” At times in the past five years, Nina has felt more like the suspect than the survivor. “The only ‘updates’ I get are when the CPS ask for something more,” she says. “They asked for my medical records, which I gave them, although I regretted that a little bit as they then started getting really invasive.” Next, the CPS asked for her mobile phone. “That was a real conundrum,” says Nina. “This happened when I was a child. I don’t have the same phone any more. There’s nothing on my phone that could relate to that period and the idea of allowing the defence, my abuser, to see what my life is like now feels so exposing. The irony is that this is a crime of consent, but the CPS can’t take no for an answer. They asked me three times, and three times I refused. The fourth time, I gave in and we came to an arrangement where they could scroll through. They wanted to confirm that I hadn’t been colluding with my mum. It just feels so violating.” Oona Brooks, a reader in criminology at Glasgow University, has studied the impact of waiting times on sexual assault survivors as part of a project funded by the Scottish government. She describes a process of “secondary victimisation”. “Sexual assault takes control away from someone and the criminal justice process replicates that sense of powerlessness,” she says. “Survivors describe living in a heightened state of anxiety – awaiting the next update, not knowing what will happen next, wondering if they’re taken seriously, feeling really unimportant. “They know they may be expected to recall details two, three, even four years later. One male survivor described waking in the night and writing things down so he wouldn’t forget them. Effectively, you’re having to hold on to these details and remain as a ‘victim’ instead of beginning to process them, in order to live your life.” Therapy for survivors coping with such pressures can be sorely needed, but accessing it is hugely problematic. Case notes can currently be requested by the defence – leaving many survivors feeling unsafe discussing complex feelings around guilt, self-blame and uncertainty in therapy. Rape Crisis is calling for therapy and counselling notes to be made non-disclosable. Likewise, there are restrictions on what you might say to others, or to whom you can talk at all, which can become increasingly unmanageable as time stretches. Brooks gives the example of a case involving rape in the context of domestic abuse, where a woman’s child might be called to give evidence. “She was concerned about what she could say to her own child, how she could help her child, and answer her questions or if she might be accused of coaching.” The pressures on daily life are immense. “Most survivors know their attacker,” says Brooks. “It’s likely he will be out on bail. He probably knows the same people, you’ll have friends or family in common, some will take sides. Survivors told me about the accused harassing and intimidating family members. One no longer felt able to use the local shops.” Monica is part of a multi-victim rape and sexual assault trial that has taken three years to come to court partly because of pandemic-related postponements. The years have added layers of trauma. Monica isn’t British, her visa has expired since reporting the case and she had to fight for discretionary leave with working rights attached – at one point, forced to live on a grant of £39 a week. “My family have no idea what happened to me,” she says. “My life was like a horror movie and a parent only wants to see that on TV. If I’d gone home, I’d have taken this broken chapter with me. I’d have felt unable to talk to anyone about the case, I’d have no support structures around me, I’d have kept everything hidden – but still it would be hanging over me and I’d have been expected to recall it all and help convict a dangerous man years later when the time came. “This wait, and the way I’ve been treated have been so difficult,” she continues. “I’m writing a victim impact statement now and the initial outrage about what was done to me has been so clouded and coloured by the years since that it’s difficult to pick it apart and examine on its own.” Nina feels the same. “I look at my friends moving on with their lives and think: ‘My childhood was stolen from me, but why does my adulthood continue to be taken from me, too?’ I worry about planning anything nice in case something happens with the case to ruin it. I’m supposed to be getting married, but I’m worried I’ll get a call, or news, or a trial date. “Booking a holiday, starting a new job, starting a family – it’s the same for everything,” she says. “I’d love to have kids, I’m at the point where I’ll shortly be able to do that, but I can’t imagine going through the court process or risk slowing it down with a pregnancy or a baby. I’ve told three different employers about it now, which is ridiculous.” There have been some moves to speed up the process. But Ellis is dubious about introducing time targets for the investigation stage. “There was a police force piloting them, but it seemed to result in cases not being investigated at all,” she says. “I’d like investigations to be more focused on the suspect and evidence of the offence, rather than so much time being spent investigating the victim. The real problem is resources – at the moment, we have overstretched officers and prosecutors with a massive case load.” At court level, Brooks supports a radical overhaul. “They’ve introduced some additional courts and digital technology for remote hearings, but that is tinkering around the edges of a system that isn’t working,” she says. Brooks is a keen supporter of proposals to introduce specialist-judge-only sexual violence courts in Scotland – something supported by Rape Crisis as a key step to improve the survivor experience. On 25 February, a joint inspection by police and CPS of the investigation and prosecution of rape cases in England and Wales found poor communication between police and CPS and also with the victims from the point of charge onwards. Its recommendations included the use of specialist rape courts. In the meantime, it is hardly surprising that crime outcomes for the year ending March 2021 showed that 33% of reported sexual offences were closed, because victims dropped out of the prosecution. There are moments when Nina would also like to walk away, but, as yet, she hasn’t. “I’m not confident that I’ll get to court,” she says. “I’m well aware that anything could happen. One of his friends asked me to withdraw because ‘he’s so old’, and: ‘Does it really make a difference?’ “I’m proceeding because it’s the right thing to do – but with each passing year, his promise that I was never going to see justice for this rings louder.”  Survivor names have been changed.

3/3/2022,"A war crimes investigation has been launched into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine after an unprecedented number of countries backed the move and Boris Johnson called the military intervention “abhorrent”. Karim Khan, the chief prosecutor for the international criminal court (ICC), said he would begin work “as rapidly as possible” to look for possible crimes against humanity or genocide committed in Ukraine. The referral for investigation by 39 countries – including the UK – will shave several months off the process because it allows Khan to bypass the need to seek the approval of the court in The Hague. It came as Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, braced for a siege and the Russian defence ministry claimed it was in “complete control” of Kherson, a southern port city near the Crimean peninsula. Support local charities There are several Ukrainian charities working on the ground. Sunflower of Peace is a charity that helps paramedics and doctors, and has been fundraising for supplies, which includes first aid medical tactical backpacks. United Help Ukraine focuses on providing medical supplies and humanitarian aid, and raising awareness of the conflict. Voices of Children aims to help children affected by the war in eastern Ukraine, providing support through art therapy, psychologists, video storytelling and a number of other methods. The British Red Cross has launched an emergency appeal to help Ukraine. The charity will be updating its webpage with news on the work its team is doing, and how support will be used to help people. Support local journalism English-language news outlets based in the country, such as Kyiv Independent and the New Voice of Ukraine, are covering developments on the ground as the conflict unfolds, using local journalists. The Kyiv Independent says it was created by journalists in order to defend editorial independence. This site on Twitter covers many local journalists in Ukraine. Write to your local MP This can be a way to lobby the British government to place further sanctions on the Russian government and its associates. You can get in touch with your local MP via email or post to their constituency address. Instructions on how to get in touch can be found on parliament.uk. Khan said an “advanced team” of investigators was already travelling to Ukraine. The British lawyer told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the push for an inquiry by so many countries “allows us to jump-start investigations” and came on top of “evidence of international concern over events on the ground in Ukraine”. “Individuals have rights to have their interests vindicated and for justice to prevail,” Khan said. “That can only take place if evidence is independently and impartially collected and assessed and then in due course, decisions can be made regarding whether or not there’s criminal responsibility, and then the judges ultimately will decide.” Asked about reports Russia was using cluster bombs in civilian areas, Khan said “it is clear … directing attacks against civilians and civilian objects amounts to a war crime”. The ICC investigation will look back as far as 21 November 2013, when Ukraine’s then president rejected closer integration with the EU, leading to huge protests that precipitated Russia’s annexation of Crimea. Liz Truss, the UK foreign secretary, accused the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, of “targeting civilians indiscriminately” and directing troops to tear through towns across Ukraine. “The UK will work closely with allies to ensure justice is done,” she said. The UK justice secretary, Dominic Raab, told the Daily Telegraph Britain could house Russian commanders suspected of war crimes in its prisons – and act as a safe haven for witnesses who testified against them. He said that “few countries around the world” had the UK’s “lead information”, which would likely prove “absolutely critical” to the ICC. As the Russian invasion entered its eighth day, the UN refugee agency estimated that 1 million people had now fled Ukraine, making it the swiftest exodus of refugees this century. More than 2,000 civilians had died since the invasion began, Ukraine’s state emergency service said. Moscow’s international isolation was further displayed when the UN general assembly voted overwhelmingly to demand Putin immediately withdraw Russian troops: 141 nations backed the motion and only five, including the alleged co-aggressor Belarus, opposed it. The UK government has been criticised for the pace of sanctions being levelled on Russians close to Putin and their business interests. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, questioned on Wednesday why it would take 18 months for a new register of property ownership to apply to existing owners. Frans Timmermans, first vice-president of the European Commission, said he thought the UK was “following our lead”. After it was revealed the Conservatives had accepted an £80,000 donation from the former wife of one of Putin’s ministers within the last six months, Timmermans added: “I think even parties who accepted funding from oligarchs should understand that they need to change course. Because, if I don’t misunderstand the mood in the UK, that’s what the British public want” Damian Hinds, the UK security minister, told LBC radio: “I don’t accept that my political party accepts money from illegitimate sources.” Hinds also welcomed the ICC investigation and said all indications suggested that Putin “is guilty” of war crimes. UK officials have said more sanctions are coming, against oligarchs, Russian national security council members and banks, and that they believe the economic shock of the moves has been more significant than Putin was expecting. ",News/World news,ICC launches war crimes investigation over Russian invasion of Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/icc-launches-war-crimes-investigation-russia-invasion-ukraine
3/3/2022,"An Indigenous community from Cabbage Tree Island in the New South Wales northern rivers region fears they have lost everything in the floods. Residents from all 23 households were forced to flee as water inundated the island, which is off Ballina and has been an Indigenous reserve since 1893. Dyonne Anderson, the principal of Cabbage Tree Island public school, feared her students won’t be able to return for months because of the flood damage. “It’s gone totally over the school even though that’s on the highest part of the island,” Anderson said. “So we know that the water damage is extremely severe for the community. “There are people that have just left with the clothes on their back. So they’re going to come back to a whole great deal of loss.” People had been placed in accomodation until at least Monday, Anderson said. “But I think it’s going to be much longer longer than that [before they can return],” she said, noting the two bridges to get there may be damaged too. The school, which counts 43 students from 3.5 years old up to 12, will probably need major repairs. “We may not return for many months,” Anderson said. It comes as the government’s response to the flooding came under fire from Greens and Labor MPs. Greens MP Tamara Smith was dismayed by the lack of coordination among government relief agencies, relying on a local armada of as many as 150 private boats to rescue stranded people and deliver supplies five days after rivers broke their banks. “The anger is palpable,” said Greens MP Tamara Smith. “It’s like, what’s the use of governments if they can’t support people at these pointy moments?” Evening conference calls with emergency services have left locals “absolutely frustrated”, Smith said. Concerns ranged from empty shops to a helicopter being used to deliver medicine to a single person because other needs weren’t known or catered for. Ballina Shire has just 18 SES volunteers for 32,000 people. “Once you go out into the hills, you’re basically cut off, you’ve got nobody there,” Smith said. Lismore, a flood-prone town that beat its previous record flood by two metres, is struggling to find homes for evacuees. About 800 people were temporarily located at the local campus of Southern Cross University, according to Labor MP Janelle Saffin. The Greens have called for a permanent rapid response team to be set up to respond to disasters, a proposal Saffin supports in light of the difficulties she is seeing on the ground.

Challenges for many people include obtaining food but also the fuel needed to secure essential supplies. Both Ampol and BP blamed access problems rather than a supply shortage. Flooding and road closures were making it difficult to reach retail outlets, both companies said, with a number of service stations forced to close. Ampol shut five retail stores across the northern regions and north coast, including both stores in Lismore, adding a “number of our employees have been directly impacted”. It said it was working directly with emergency services to maintain adequate supplies. BP said it was “working closely with partners and local authorities to navigate the impacts of the weather”. Ballina mayor Sharon Cadwallader said emergency services in her area had managed to secure an emergency fuel from one local service station but the some faced big difficulties. The outlets that did have fuel were unable to use cards and the stations were out of cash. “I’m not aware that we’ve had any fuel supply whatsoever,” she told the Guardian, adding that food was also running low including in evacuation centres. “We managed to get a canoe to get some food supplies out of one of the charities that wasn’t affected - well it was affected, but a lot of product wasn’t. So that was good,” Cadwallader said. The industry peak group, the Australasian Convenience and Petroleum Marketers Association, described the damage to outlets as “unprecedented” . “There are service stations where the water is basically to the top of the canopy,” chief executive Mark McKenzie told the ABC. “It’s going to be some time in those areas before we can get fuel flowing again.” Guardian Australia contacted the NSW premier Dominic Perrottet’s office and Resilience NSW for a response",News/Australia news,Fears for Indigenous community of NSW island as anger rises about government’s flood response,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/03/fears-for-indigenous-community-of-nsw-island-as-anger-rises-about-government-response
3/3/2022,"Hello and good morning. Russia has captured the city of Kherson. The Black Sea port has become the first major Ukrainian target to fall under the de facto control of Russia forces. As the international criminal court said it had begun collecting evidence of possible war crimes in Ukraine, Kherson’s mayor, Igor Kolykhaiev, said in a Facebook post today Russian troops were in control of the city hall and that residents should obey a curfew imposed by “armed visitors”. Russian artillery and missiles have continued to bombard other key cities including the capital, Kyiv, but the advance into the capital itself has stalled. The United Nations said more than a million people had fled the country since the invasion began a week ago. As the conflict entered its second week, the UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, said there had been an “exodus” from Ukraine to neighbouring countries of more than 1 million people, or about 2% of the population of 44 million. How high could refugee numbers climb? The UN estimates there could be as many as 4 million refugees from the invasion, crossing the borders into neighbouring countries. How many Russian soldiers have been sent to their deaths by president Vladimir Putin so far? Ukraine’s government said yesterday nearly 6,000 Russian troops had been killed. Moscow said the figure was 498. How many international allies does Russia have over the invasion? Four. At yesterday’s emergency UN general assembly session, only Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea and Syria voted with Putin. 141 opposed and 35 abstained. Police in Moscow detained two women and five children who wanted to lay flowers at the Ukrainian embassy. Photographs of their detention showed the children holding a poster saying “No to war”. The children, aged seven to 11, were held with their mothers in a police van before being taken to a police station. They were released hours later, according to the anthropologist Alexandra Arkhipova. Meanwhile, Yelena Osipova, a 77-year-old artist and activist, was also marched away by a group of police while she protested against the war in St Petersburg. How many Russian protesters have been arrested? Almost 7,000 people since the invasion began, according to monitoring organisation OVD-Info. How is Russia’s economy being impacted? Analysts at Goldman Sachs downgraded Russia’s 2022 growth forecasts from a 2% climb to a 7% contraction. What about Russia’s global reputation? Russian and Belarusian athletes will be banned from the Beijing Winter Paralympics, the International Paralympic Committee announced this morning. The House select committee investigating the 6 January Capitol attack said Donald Trump violated multiple federal laws to overturn the 2020 election, including obstructing Congress and defrauding the United States. The former president knew he had not won enough electoral college votes to win the 2020 election, but sought the then-vice-president, Mike Pence, to manipulate the results in his favor, the filing said. Had the effort to pressure Pence into returning Trump to power succeeded, the certification of Joe Biden’s win would have been impeded. The select committee said it believed Trump defrauded the US by interfering in the certification process, disseminating false information about election fraud, and pressuring state officials to alter state election results. A Texas judge blocked the state from investigating the parents of a transgender teenager over gender-confirmation treatments yesterday, but stopped short of blocking other investigations. The lawsuit marked the first report of parents being investigated after the Republican governor Greg Abbott’s order that officials view such treatments as abuse. About 500,000 across New South Wales, Australia were under evacuation orders or warnings yesterday as wild weather battered the greater Sydney region. Emergency services received almost 12,000 requests for help since the start of the floods crisis. Marilyn Manson filed a lawsuit against Evan Rachel Wood for defamation over the actor’s sexual abuse allegations against him. The LA superior court complaint accuses Wood of depicting him as “a rapist and abuser” that has “derailed” Manson’s career. The Russian businessman Roman Abramovich confirms Chelsea soccer club is up for sale and writes off $2bn loans. Abramovich’s position had been under growing uncertainty since he announced plans to transfer stewardship to a charitable foundation on Saturday. German authorities have seized the $600m superyacht belonging to the Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov. Usmanov was on a list of billionaires to face sanctions from the European Union. The impact of the pandemic threatens to reverse decades of progress made towards gender equality, according to a study that reveals women have been hit much harder socially and economically than men. Research by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington found, among other things, the greatest and most persistent gender gap was seen in employment and uncompensated labour, with 26% of women reporting loss of work compared with 20% of men globally in September 2021. California is trying to get ahead of the problem, becoming the first US state to put in place a comprehensive plan for tackling microplastics. The roadmap of 22 actions is focused on preventing plastic particles from getting into the environment, intercepting plastics pollution and educating the public about the problem. But Katharine Gammon asks, will it be enough? “As I held him in the bunker, I said to him: ‘You’re lucky, you’re unique, you’re born in Ukraine, you’re a new Ukrainian’,” writes Viktoria about giving birth in a Kyiv bomb shelter. “Every morning now I wake up a bit earlier just to look at him sleep, he looks like a small angel. I also look out the window to see if the buildings have stayed in their places or if they’ve been ruined. I hope my son will experience this war only from stories – that he will never, never feel what it’s like in real life. I don’t want him to know real war.” “Throughout my early 20s, I spent a lot of time seeking to acquire knowledge about my body. It was unwell, this much was certain, and the question of how was one to which I applied myself studiously,” writes Will Rees in the Guardian long read. “The doctor placed a stethoscope on my back in order to listen to my lungs, placing his other hand against my chest to steady himself. His grip tightened, signifying something. He cleared his throat and composed himself. ‘Did you have any plans today, Mr Rees?’ He instructed me to go to the emergency room.” Bringing flowers into the kitchen – in a recipe, not a vase – is a way to add a touch of flavur, as well as a feast for your eyes, writes Emine Saner. The trend for edible flowers has been blooming for several years but, for many of us, the idea of munching petals, instead of admiring them, is still a leap. Edible flowers include lavender, roses, hollyhocks, pelargoniums, nasturtiums and pansies. Try it, you will find pumpkin soup is suddenly stunning when garnished with violas.

3/3/2022,"Name: Food surprises. Age: Well, there was a 34th anniversary the other day. Whose 34th anniversary? A couple by the name of Maria and Michael Spressler. They have been married for 34 years? No, it was their 34-year anniversary of visiting their favourite restaurant. Which is …? The Lobster House in Cape May, New Jersey, which was established on the harbourfront in 1954. Lovely. But I’m guessing there’s more to this story? So much more. Michael had chosen a clam appetiser and was down to his 12th and final clam when he bit into something hard. A loose tooth? That was his first thought. “He actually thought his tooth had fallen out,” Maria said. It was in fact a pearl. Hang on: pearls are found in oysters, not clams. That is a common misconception. All molluscs – oysters, clams, mussels – can make pearls, though most of the ones found round the necks of Sloaney ladies are seeded by hand. Natural pearls are worth more, potentially … How much? That depends on size. How big was this one? It was 8.83mm. “It’s pure white, almost perfectly round. Really very nice – a it’s the perfect pearl,” said Maria. She would say that. What do the experts say? Who needs experts? But OK, Eddi Levi, the manager of DSL Pearl in New York, said the value of a pearl depends on its lustre. The shinier the better. A good one, of that size, could be worth $10,000. Dull and blemished, on the other hand, maybe a few hundred. Whatever it turns out to be worth, it’s a lot better than finding a dead mouse in a loaf of bread. Yes! There have been lots of weird and not so wonderful things found in food over the years. Like an actual tooth in a block of cheese, a frog in a can of Pepsi, a condom in some chips, allegedly, and another mouse inside a tin of beans. It’s usually mice. There’s a difference here, though. Pearls are found naturally in molluscs – they belong. Condoms in chips, less so. True: lethal spiders in bunches of bananas is another common find. Yes, but you probably wouldn’t want to find a spider in your bananas, whereas a beautiful – and possibly valuable – pearl is nice. More like finding a golden ticket inside a chocolate bar. It’s just a shame it didn’t happen on the Spresslers’ 30th anniversary … Let me guess, that’s … Exactly, the pearl anniversary. Do say: “The world is your oyster.” Don’t say: “Oops, swallowed it. I’ll have a look later …”",Lifestyle/Food,"Waiter, there’s a pearl in my dinner!
