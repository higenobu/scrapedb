3/17/2022,"This long-awaited indie game stars an adorable little fox, and his green apparel leaves no doubt as to where the game’s affections lie. Aesthetically and structurally, this is a Zelda tribute, with cute-yet-menacing baddies to bash with a sword and repel with a shield as you gradually uncover more and more of a sprawling world that stretches far underground and up into snowy mountain reaches, through gloomy dungeons illuminated by mysteriously glowing pools. But it is not a pale imitation. It’s a bit of a reinvention. Tunic displays not only a deep love for Nintendo’s adventure classic and games like it, but a deep and even subversive understanding of what makes them tick. Tunic is surprisingly tough, taking just as much inspiration from Dark Souls. The world fits together like a clockwork model, full of pleasing shortcuts and hidden paths, and so pleasing to walk around that I felt compelled to draw it out in a notebook to see how it connected. Bonfire checkpoints give you somewhere safe to arise again after a death, but resting at them also respawns all the monsters around you. And like both Dark Souls and Zelda, Tunic has immense respect both for the player’s ingenuity, and for the unique magic of video games – their ability to tell a story that’s unscripted, and powered by your own curiosity, unlikely triumphs and sudden revelations. This game doesn’t tell you anything, you see. There’s no on-screen prompt directing you how to fight or where to go. You’re always coming across things that you don’t yet understand. You’ll pick up some blue berry, or find a coin in a chest, and have no idea what to do with it until you start experimenting. You make sense of Tunic’s world by collecting the scattered pages of a manual, which you can then pore over for clues as to what you ought to be doing. But most of this manual is written in an incomprehensible runic script, with just the odd English word, leaving you to puzzle out the meaning. This is going to feel obtuse for some players but I was in heaven, because it reminded me so exactly of what it was like paging through the manuals of mysterious Japanese SNES and N64 games that I picked up on the cheap when I was an exchange student, and was only able to pick out the occasional word here and there among the screenshots. You have to study the pages for illustrations, clues, handwritten notes, little symbols that might mean something. If you are old enough to remember the little sealed hints booklet that came with 90s adventure games – and the manuals, which I used read in bed as a child until they fell apart – this will likely be as evocative for you as it was for me. When I wasn’t sure what to do next, I’d scour the map for areas I hadn’t yet visited, or places I’d already been that I might now see differently. Parts of Tunic’s world are gated off behind obvious barriers, but it’s usually knowledge you need, rather than a specific tool, in order to progress. The game did sometimes leave me hanging; I definitely missed out on some manual pages somehow, and arrived at a few crucial solutions or locations through aimless backtracking or sheer luck. The manual does just enough to point you in the right direction, but you have to figure out the game’s many secrets for yourself. This is an aspect of games that has been ruined by the existence of Google and online walkthroughs and even on-screen mini-maps: the mystery. It’ll be tempting to reach for your phone and start looking for a solution when you get stuck in Tunic, but resist the impulse if you can. Just … be stuck for a while. The resultant wandering and thinking will lead you somewhere unexpected, and before you know it you’ll have found the way forward by yourself. It feels luxurious to play a game that isn’t constantly prodding you towards the next objective, and that instead allows you the space to daydream.

3/17/2022,"When the independent Russian TV station Dozhd, or TV Rain, was forced off air by the government earlier this month, its final act was to cut to footage of the ballet Swan Lake. “That was epic trolling,” says cultural historian Simon Morrison, author of the book Bolshoi Confidential. It was the same footage that was played on every Russian TV channel as tanks rolled into Moscow during the attempted coup in August 1991. “When the putsch happened in the Gorbachev era, the screens turned to Swan Lake because they didn’t want people to know what was happening,” explains Morrison. “So [Dozhd] was trolling them for mass censorship. ‘You don’t want people to know what’s happening in Ukraine – here’s your Swan Lake!’” After Russia invaded Ukraine, UK tours by the Russian State Ballet of Siberia and Moscow’s Bolshoi Ballet were cancelled, the latest example of ballet’s role as a political football and diplomatic tool over many decades. As a wordless art, dance travels well. With strong links to the Kremlin, the Bolshoi has been hailed as Russia’s “secret weapon” by former prime minister Dmitry Medvedev, sent abroad to “achieve our goals”, he said, unabashed about using the ballet studio as an arsenal of soft power. Ballet holds a revered place in Russian culture across all sections of society. A Russian I once knew mainly for his love of football turned out to be equally knowledgable about ballet. I was surprised by his interest. “Why wouldn’t you be,” he said, “when you’re the best in the world?” Ballet wasn’t born in Russia (its roots are in Italy and France) but it was at the Imperial Russian Ballet in St Petersburg in the late 19th century that most people agree classical ballet reached its zenith, with Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov’s creation of the ballets – Swan Lake, Sleeping Beauty, The Nutcracker – that remain the backbones of the repertoire. The dancers of the Mariinsky (formerly the Imperial, then Kirov) are famed for their willowy physiques, the corps de ballet militaristically drilled in magical unison; the Bolshoi for their giant leaps and flashy virtuosity. The ballets and the companies themselves reflected political ideology. “The hierarchy of the court is represented in the ranks of the company,” says Morrison. “Petipa put on stage a model of behaviour and decorum within a space that was highly controlled – ultra-civilised but ultra-repressive at the same time.” The ballets were then reframed for the Soviet era, the massed movement of the corps de ballet “easy to convert into the Soviet experience”, he says, “where the individual desire and aspiration is defined through the collective”. Under director Yuri Grigorovich from 1964 to 1995, Bolshoi ballets such as Spartacus and Ivan the Terrible demonstrated Soviet might and morals. Censors had their say and plots were changed – famously conjuring up a happy ending to the great tragedy of Swan Lake. The first tour of the Bolshoi to London, which took place in 1956, was not predominantly about propaganda but designed for financial gain. It was a hot ticket: people started queueing for seats three days before the box office opened (when the Bolshoi toured the US in 1959, touts reportedly sold tickets for up to $1,200 in today’s money). The whole thing was almost jeopardised by an incident involving a Soviet discus thrower who was accused of stealing five hats from a shop on Oxford Street, but after some diplomatic wrangling it went ahead, and reviews were mostly ecstatic. (Which was just as well: in 1959, Soviet authorities made known their dissatisfaction with mild criticism in the US press, and only a few years ago a Bolshoi press representative queried a lukewarm review of my own in this paper.) A year after the Bolshoi’s UK visit, the British ballerina Beryl Grey became the first western ballerina to guest with the company (in Swan Lake, of course). In her autobiography she recalls a woman sitting at the end of the hotel corridor surveilling everyone’s movements, but also the hugely warm welcome from the company’s star dancers, who joined her for dinner with the British ambassador. She told me in 2018: “It was the first time any of the Bolshoi had been to the British embassy, so that was a good breakthrough. I felt I did some good.” It wasn’t a complete thaw in relations: Grey revisited the theatre the following year and security wouldn’t even let her through the stage door. American Ballet Theatre visited the USSR in 1960, and New York City Ballet were in Moscow in 1962 when the Cuban missile crisis kicked off; they were told that the US embassy had no power to intervene if the dancers were interned there. NYCB dancers remembered a tepid response at the premiere – the audience not wanting to seem too appreciative about anything American – but applause became increasingly enthusiastic, even as political tensions were rising. Meanwhile, the Bolshoi were in America. “As long as they keep dancing and the diplomats keep talking, we’ll have no war,” said producer Sol Hurok at the time. Straight after the crisis was resolved, the New York Times reported President Kennedy’s first social outing was to the Bolshoi’s Swan Lake. He reportedly clapped louder and longer than anyone in his section. Did these tours genuinely aid cultural understanding? Morrison thinks so. “In the Soviet period, where our knowledge of people in the Soviet Union was very distant and they were represented as an empire and a menace, you actually saw dancers on stage and they seemed genuine. They really cared, they were dancing their tails off and that was great. It humanised them,” he says. Those tours offered a chance for cultural exchange, but also opportunities for Soviet dancers to defect to the west, dealing a political blow to the USSR when Rudolf Nureyev told a French policeman at Le Bourget airport in Paris in 1961: “I want to stay and to be free.” The fiercely charismatic, wild whirlwind of a dancer brought a huge boost in popularity and publicity to ballet in this country when he settled in London. He was followed by Natalia Makarova, who defected in London in 1970, and Mikhail Baryshnikov, who defected in Toronto in 1974. They notably all came from St Petersburg. The Muscovites were more closely controlled, teachers paid to report on their charges, families at home essentially held as collateral. “The Bolshoi was, for a while, the Stalinist court ballet,” says Morrison. Baryshnikov became a piece of Hollywood propaganda in the 1985 film White Nights, when he and the great tap dancer Gregory Hines (whose character has unbelievably defected in the opposite direction, to Russia) risk it all for American freedom. The same year, the Soviets made Flight 222 dramatising the 1979 defection of Bolshoi dancer Alexander Godunov, whose wife chose to return to Russia. Godunov stayed in the US and began an acting career with roles in Witness and Die Hard, but died of alcoholism aged 45. Nowadays, the two big Russian companies regularly visit London. When they tour, Morrison points out, they dance more conservative rep than at home, giving people the “exotica” they want. Whereas once it was orientalist fantasies such as La Bayadère, “now they want the Soviet, it’s the new exoticism”. Dancers move more freely between countries and artistic styles, but are now caught in politics once more. Yorkshire-born Xander Parish, who moved from the Royal Ballet to be a principal with the Mariinsky in 2010, said this week he was leaving Russia. Meanwhile, Ukrainian ballerina Lesia Vorotnyk was pictured holding a machine gun. Former Bolshoi director Alexei Ratmansky left a half-finished ballet in Moscow and returned to the US where he has been artist in residence at American Ballet Theatre since 2009. He has family in Kyiv and has been marshalling international artists to speak out for peace on his Facebook page, including Russians Natalia Osipova and Vladimir Shklyarov. The Royal Ballet’s Vadim Muntagirov dedicated his opening performance of Swan Lake on 1 March to the people of Ukraine and the Royal Opera House has been playing the Ukrainian national anthem every night before shows. Some dancers with Russian connections feel it’s too risky to speak frankly – and in the music world, Bolshoi conductor Tugan Sokhiev has resigned rather than publicly take sides – but one of the Bolshoi’s star dancers Olga Smirnova has left the country and joined Dutch National Ballet after posting on Telegram her shame at Russia’s actions, saying “I am against war with all the fibres of my soul ... We may not be at the epicenter of the military conflict, but we cannot remain indifferent to this global catastrophe.” Some argue that cancelling performances has more of an impact on the artists than the regime. “On one level it’s humiliating,” says Morrison. “On the other hand, this kind of ‘cancel Russia’ campaign plays into the regime’s hands: ‘See, they are against us, they’re out to get us.’” Ballet may be the ultimate escapist art form, but some realities we can’t escape. “I have a photo on my phone of a protester being dragged away in front of a ballet advertisement,” says Morrison. “There’s Russia, right there: the riot police in front of the dancers.”",Arts/Stage,Dancers and dissidents: how ballet became a political football between east and west,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/17/dancers-and-dissidents-how-ballet-became-a-political-football-between-east-and-west
3/17/2022,"It was during a late-night, mid-pandemic Zoom call with my also-fat friend that we, almost whispering, admitted to each other that we were quite enjoying lockdown. Not the deaths and the government’s mishandling of the situation, nor having just lost all our income. “Obviously not that!” we would say, repeatedly. “Of course, we don’t enjoy those things.” So what did we enjoy? It took us a while to figure out why we felt lighter, more confident. More at peace with ourselves … and our fat bodies. Eventually, one of us said: “I haven’t been shouted at in the street for a long time.” We began listing all the things that we had got used to over decades of living in fat bodies, which we were no longer experiencing because the world had shut down and we had to stay at home. These are things you don’t tend to notice if you live in a smaller body: how many chairs and seats have armrests, for example. But, at a certain size, armrests mean that you have to ask if there is another seat available. If not, you can’t sit down. And unless you have balls of steel and are willing to see if the audience at Les Misérables will accept you standing up in the middle of the stalls, you will probably just have to leave. Quarantine was the only time in my adult life where I hadn’t felt the stress of “can I fit into this seat?” or the painful, pinching feeling of the armrests digging into my hips, cutting off blood supply to my legs. Suddenly, there were no plane seats, tube seats, cafe seats, waiting room seats or – yes – toilet seats. Or toilet stalls. At no point during quarantine did I go to a bathroom only to find there was a serious risk that if I sat down I would end up stuck between the two partitions, one bum cheek resting on a sanitary bin. There was no standing on an escalator, making yourself as small as possible so as not to annoy the people who have to squeeze past. There was no sucking your stomach in as you try to get to your table in a restaurant, in case it might slap other diners across the neck. Later in the pandemic, going to a cafe was incredible: for the first time there was space, due to social distancing. “This must be what the world feels like for thin people,” I said to my friend. “Do you think they all walk around feeling like the world is … made for them?” Meanwhile, medical professionals from all sides were debating whether or not Covid affected fat people more than thin people and if so, why, and so on. Meanwhile, fat people were among some of the first groups to qualify for the vaccine. It is rare, as a fat person, to feel privileged. Apart from our bodies functioning as a dickhead-detector – we can quickly identify when a person only treats others well if they are conventionally attractive – there are few upsides. Until the vaccines. Being fat often means that you get worse medical treatment – and suddenly, we were prioritised! I felt elated. I now understand why people with privilege can be so obnoxious sometimes. Towards the end of the Zoom call with my fat friend, she said, in a quiet voice: “I’m actually not looking forward to lockdown ending. Especially now that I’m so much fatter.” I nodded. So many of us have gained weight – a completely natural and understandable reaction to having lived through a global pandemic, quarantined at home. While it’s obviously a good thing that fewer people are getting sick and dying from Covid, there are a lot of us who miss aspects of the quarantine period. Disabled and chronically ill people, who have always been forced to stay at home, were finally able to enjoy more live shows being streamed. When people on social media complained about cabin fever, I saw my disabled friends saying: “That’s what we’ve been trying to tell you!” through gritted teeth. Many of us fat people experienced what it was like to not be abused in the street or feel unwelcome in public spaces. It was nice. I don’t want things to go back to what they were like before. I want us to enter into a new reality, where we take better care of people, regardless of the bodies in which they exist. Two years without experiencing fatphobia has made me feel happier, more confident and less stressed. It would be good if it didn’t take a global pandemic to reach that state.

3/17/2022,"Hello, and happy Thursday, Last week, I spoke on the phone with Pamela Moses, the Black Lives Matter activist who was sentenced to six years in prison for trying to register to vote. It was the first interview Moses has given since being released, and I found it revelatory. I’ve been following Moses’ case for the last few months, but we had only really talked at length once previously. Before I called her, I found myself thinking back to our first conversation, in early December, when Moses explained how no one had ever told her she was ineligible to vote. “I’m a person that relies on paperwork … I go by what’s in writing,” she told me then. It was an offhand comment that foreshadowed the turning point in her case: ultimately it was paperwork – a document that prosecutors failed to turn over – that helped her get a new trial. In our conversation last week, Moses was unequivocal in her belief that she was targeted both because of her race and because of her activism. She has long been critical of several local government officials, including judges, the election commission and Amy Weirich, the district attorney who is prosecuting her case. “It’s a scare tactic, what they did to me,” she told me. “I believe, not only if I wasn’t Black, but if my name wasn’t Pamela Moses, this probably never would have been a case.” The reason Moses lost the right to vote in the first place was because she had been convicted of a felony in 2015 (she pleaded guilty to charges of stalking, tampering with evidence, theft and perjury). She said she’s spoken with other people who have felony convictions who are now unsure if they should vote. “If you silence the loudest person that’s screaming, ‘Hey Black people, go vote, don’t vote for her, remove her from office,’ then you eliminate the opposition,” she said. I also asked Moses what she made of one of the few public statements Weirich has given about the case, in which Weirich said Moses bore some responsibility for her long sentence because she refused to accept a plea deal that didn’t involve prison time. “I decided to use my constitutional right. What is wrong with people using their constitutional right for a trial by jury?” Moses said. She also described her disbelief when prosecutors and the judge overseeing her case accused her of deceiving a probation officer into signing a form indicating she was done with probation. “I was like, wow – I need to go to magic school or something. I’m the new Houdini. I’ve got that much power to trick somebody I’ve never met, never seen in my life into doing something just by walking in the place? You know? No.” A document obtained by the Guardian showed that probation officials investigated the incident almost immediately afterwards and found that the probation officer made a good-faith error in signing off on the document. Even though the officer’s error helped set Moses’ case in motion, she made it clear that she thought he shouldn’t be blamed. “I don’t like how everybody is portraying that supervisor as a bad person. That man did his job,” she said. “I don’t think that I tricked anybody and I don’t think that man did anything other than what he could do based on the information that he had in front of him.” I was also struck by the clear toll the case had taken on Moses. While she talked about how she’s enjoyed spending time with her 13-year-old son, taking him to school and watching Netflix with him, she also said how anxious she was, and how upset she was that her dog died while she was in prison. “Being with my son has been a great feeling, because he’s actually happier than I am. I’m not gonna lie to you, I’ve been really perplexed. I’ve had a lot of anxiety,” she told me. “ I’m worried because these charges haven’t gone away.” A retrial is currently set for 25 April, and Moses’ legal team wants the district attorney to either drop the case or appoint a special prosecutor. Texas officials rejected around 13% of all mail-in ballots during the primary, a staggeringly high number. Georgia Republicans advanced a bill that would give the Georgia Bureau Investigation additional power over election crimes Florida Republicans approved a measure that eliminates the term “drop box” in state law – a cosmetic move that one county says will cost between $50,000 and $60,000 to implement The Wisconsin Elections Commission declined to punish Republicans who posed as fake electors in the state.

3/17/2022,"When Wet Wet Wet had been at No 1 for ages with Love Is All Around they eventually got the record company to withdraw it from stores because they were so fed up with it. Did you ever come close to that with (Everything I Do) I Do It for You when it was the UK No 1 for a record 16 weeks? keithinfife I do remember my record company wanting to withdraw it and focus on the album and I told them they’d be mad to. If they had, we’d never have got the record. I wrote the song with my dear friend Michael Kamen – rest in peace – and [producer] Mutt Lange. When it was used in the film Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves I went to see it with my girlfriend and it played over the end credits as everyone was leaving the theatre. I said: “Well, they can’t have liked it very much if they stuck it at the end,” but maybe it stayed in people’s heads. When you have an international smash like (Everything I Do) I Do It for You, how much pressure is there to repeat the success? stevey1001 I don’t remember any pressure, but I wasn’t in the UK when all that was going on. I’d just get reports as it exploded. You can’t possibly follow up a hit that big but it did reignite interest in my back catalogue. Shortly afterwards I got a call telling me Summer of ’69 was No 1 in Holland, 10 years after it was first released. Did you really play your first real six-string till your fingers bled [as in Summer Of ’69]? noirnoirnoir I did and that’s something that a lot of guitar players will attest to. I actually put a photograph on my Instagram last year after I was playing bass and I got a blood blister. Actual bleeding fingers only really happen when you first start playing: you soon get callouses so it doesn’t happen any more. Where did you really buy your first real six-string? ElZorro When I was 10 or 11 I’d stopped in the UK to visit my uncle in Reading and he took me to buy a guitar [an imitation Stratocaster]. We were on our way to live in Israel, and then when I left that country I gave it to my young neighbour, an aspiring musician. Years later he wrote to me asking if I wanted it back, but then I didn’t hear again. Much later a guy came up to me in a club in Berlin and told me that my neighbour had died in a plane crash, but he knew he’d promised to send me the guitar. It arrived within a few days and I still have it. The first “real” six-string was a black Les Paul copy I bought in a pawn shop [a “five and dime” in the song] in Ottawa. I was a Steve Marriott fan and he played one. What’s the weirdest, most off-the-wall concert you’ve ever played? Incredible-disc An outdoor gig in Turkey. The first 20 rows had been given to local politicians, so they showed up in dinner suits and ballgowns. It was pretty surreal. Behind them were the screaming mob, so I got them all to come to the front. They all seemed to enjoy it well enough. How did you end up working with Chicane? Would you agree that it was the most unlikely collaboration – and that the result (Don’t Give Up) was pop gold? haemorrhoid Nick [Bracegirdle] from Chicane called me up out of the blue and asked if I would possibly be interested in helping him write a song. He came over, I wrote a lyric and melody and recorded it then and there. The next thing I knew, he’d dialled it into his dance music world and put a vocoder on my voice. It was unusual, but I loved it. I wanted to join the band. He came on stage with me once in Ireland and we did the show together. When You’re Gone reminds me of Stop Draggin’ My Heart Around by Stevie Nicks and Tom Petty. What duets did you have in mind while writing it? Laurasnapes I wrote it just for me, but then towards the end I thought maybe it would be cool to have a duet on it. I ran into the sweetheart, Mel C. She was up for doing it, my co-writer Eliot [Kennedy] recorded her and sent her vocals over to the studio in Canada where I was and we just slotted it together. When You’re Gone is a karaoke classic. What do you like singing at karaoke? citizen-idiot Once in New York there was a guy on before me and when he got up the place went crazy. I got up and did You’ve Lost That Loving Feeling and after I finished there was one guy clapping. Afterwards I told the first singer he was great and he went: “Oh, I’m a professional singer.” He had no idea who I was. Do you plan to visit and perform again in Pakistan? The concert with Shehzad Roy in Karachi [in 2006] was a wonderful occasion. Game He wrote to me and asked if I would perform to raise money for earthquake victims. We raised $100,000 from the show and President Musharraf matched us dollar for dollar. He gave a very sweet speech thanking us for coming and then I had to speak to a table of 150 people. I was thinking: “My dad would love this!” In the right circumstances I’d go again but my drummer was freaked out that someone blew up our hotel two weeks after we left. If you had to choose between only doing photography or music, which would you choose? TheOneAndOnlyRHM Oh, music. As much as I love photography, I love being a singer. I always carried a camera around as a way of documenting tours and such and I’m glad I did, because otherwise I’d forget a lot of the situations. How do you keep your voice in shape on tour? SouthendOnSea Cups of tea! Is there a song in your catalogue you felt certain would be a hit but was met with indifference? KitRey I always loved 18 Till I Die [which reached No 22 in the UK]. With the new album we released “teaser tracks” rather than singles, which is the way now. I played every instrument because we couldn’t get the band together. I’m not a very good drummer but would think: “What would John Bonham do?” What’s the story behind Can’t Stop This Thing We Started? Chris33 Mutt Lange started the idea. We’d spent a week on it when he accidentally erased the verse. He just went: “OK, let’s write a new one!” I spent a couple of days working on the vocal and he kept saying: “This just doesn’t sound right.” Sure enough, the microphone that I’d been singing through for two days was completely blown. The War On Drugs get compared to your 80s output, in a good way. Do you like them? Manofthesouth I really like them. Can I join the band?

3/17/2022,"Last December in Moscow, dozens of international art world luminaries stepped out of the snow and into the vast, pristine galleries of GES-2, a new art centre. Located in a converted power station just a short walk from the Kremlin, the institution was funded by oligarch Leonid Mikhelson’s V-A-C Foundation. The westerners weren’t its first visitors, however. President Putin had visited two days earlier and tinkled on a piano set up in the atrium. Mikhelson was one of several oligarchs who was summoned to the Kremlin the day after the Russian invasion of Ukraine started. With the Russian super-rich facing prohibition, the glamour of such glitzy art events has faded – and left many observers questioning how reliant the art world has become on Russian money, both in terms of museum patronage and oligarchs’ spending power at the auction houses and galleries in London, Paris and New York. “Russians have a huge presence not just in the art market but the whole art world,” says Ivan Macquisten, who advises cultural institutions on risk. “We are talking about museums, galleries, foundations.” It’s pretty clear what is – or was – in it for the oligarchs. “If you are associated with an institution that has a reputation within society, it can give you cultural, social and political standing. It can give you access to markets, to influential people – not just politicians, but them too.” Art critic Ben Lewis agrees: “It’s artwashing – it launders oligarchs’ reputations. The more these individuals, and these countries, weave themselves into the international art world, the harder it is to criticise them.” The arrival of the Russian super-rich in the western art world was heralded in May 2008 when Roman Abramovich, not previously known as a collector , bought Lucian Freud’s Benefits Supervisor Sleeping for £17m at Christie’s in New York, followed by Francis Bacon’s Triptych for £43m the next evening from Sotheby’s. The purchases came a week after Putin flipped from president to prime minister, extending his power beyond the two consecutive terms allowed under the Russian constitution. The art market, largely unregulated, provides an easy way of shifting money out of the country. Macquisten notes that cultivating a higher public profile abroad, whether it be through art patronage or sport, can also offer a degree of protection at home. “If you look at someone like Abramovich, by buying Chelsea he became a massive public figure. I’m not saying that made him untouchable, but it certainly made him less vulnerable within Russia. Russian business people have been got at, but they might not have been very high profile. If you are much more of a public figure, the authorities back home might stop and think a little before acting.” By 2008, interest in Russian art, mainly from Russian buyers, had increased 703% from 2003 levels, and that year the Phillips auction house was bought by the Russian Mercury Group. At the 2011 Venice Biennale, Abramovich and his then partner Dasha Zhukova had provoked the ire of locals by parking their 377ft yacht Luna in the Grand Canal, throwing numerous parties to launch a video art project featuring the artists Gillian Wearing, Sarah Morris and Tom Sachs. Four years later, Ambramovic and Zhukova opened the Garage gallery in Moscow’s Gorky Park. Old gossip column photos show the Serpentine’s Hans Ulrich Obrist hanging with dealers such as Larry Gagosian and Sadie Coles. Star Wars director George Lucas and artist Jeff Koons were also in attendance. British institutions were involved with Garage too. For years, the V&A museum boasted of its advisory work on the foundation’s “branding and positioning” in a since-deleted webpage. Mikhelson’s foundation also has a presence in London’s public art institutions, staging four shows at the Whitechapel Gallery between 2014 and 2018, with the Whitechapel returning the favour at the palazzo V-A-C owns in Venice. He has also provided sponsorship and patronage of the Tate in London and sat on the board of trustees at the New Museum in New York, again between 2014 and 2018. Novatek, the gas company of which he is the major shareholder, has been under US federal sanctions since 2014, with Mikhelson recommended for personal sanctions in 2018 by the US treasury. Earlier this month questions were asked in parliament as to why Britain had not put Mikhelson personally under sanctions. At the Garage, where Ambramovich remains on the board, a show of Helen Marten, the Turner prize winner represented by Coles’s gallery, has also been cancelled alongside all other future programming. Zhukova is not an oligarch herself, and has spoken out against the Russian invasion of Ukraine, telling the New York Post: “The brutal and horrific invasion taken by Russia against Ukraine is shameful. As someone born in Russia, I unequivocally condemn these acts of war, and I stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian people as well as with the millions of Russians who feel the same way.” Zhukova remains a trustee at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, but plenty of other high profile Russian billionaires have had to quit their board positions at western institutions since the war began. Vladimir Potanin and Petr Aven, who were also summoned to see Putin on 24 February, have resigned their respective trusteeships at the Guggenheim Museum in New York and the Royal Academy in London. In 2020 the Neue Galerie in Berlin staged a show of Russian modernism heavily borrowing from Aven’s collection. Now that Aven in under sanction by the EU and in Britain, were that exhibition to happen now, the museum would presumably be in the awkward position of having to seize its patron’s assets. “Any museum will vet who comes on their board, but as times change, the risk changes, and what is acceptable changes, which is why you are seeing these resignations now,” Macquisten says. “If institutions now assess any Russian money to be risky money, that might very well create big financial problems for them.” Sponsorships such as Tate Modern’s 2019 Natalia Goncharova retrospective by Letter One, a company owned by Mikhail Fridman, a close associate of Aven also under sanctions, are therefore inconceivable now. The EU described Fridmanas an “enabler of Putin’s inner circle … he actively supported materially or financially and benefited from Russian decision-makers responsible for the annexation of Crimea and the destabilisation of Ukraine.” Fridman and Aven released a joint statement describing the measures taken against them as “spurious and unfounded basis” and say they will contest them. In 2008, yet another oligarch, Alisher Usmanov, also now under sanctions in the UK, and facing them in the United States, facilitated Tate’s loan of 112 works by JMW Turner to the Pushkin Museum in Moscow. At the time the deal was hailed by the British Council as “a vital way of supporting the bonds between two countries”. Usmanov also offered significant funding to the restoration of the Cutty Sark, opened by the Queen in Greenwich in 2012. A spokesperson for the Tate said “There are no UK sanctions on any of Tate’s current individual or corporate supporters and any historic relationships with former donors associated with the Russian government have now ended.” Samuel Ramani, an associate fellow at the RUSI defence and security thinktank, suggests that remaining in Britain is too risky for Russian billionaires anyway. “These oligarchs are obviously very concerned about the protection of their assets and their loss of standing in what I guess we might call polite society in the west,” he says. “I suspect they will sit in opposition to the war, because they will know a war of this magnitude will lead to sanctions. They will be moving their assets to other places, to Dubai, assets like superyachts to the Maldives, out of their traditional European vendors such as Switzerland, London, Monaco, Paris.” Le Conseil des Ventes, which represents French auctioneers, has advised its members that even if a sale is cancelled, any assets or funds belonging to those under sanctions must remain in its possession. If the exodus of Russian money causes a headache for western museums, then it also poses a problem for private art galleries and the auction houses. Under the 2019 EU anti-money-laundering rules, copied over to British law post-Brexit, all transactions over €10,000 require due diligence. As part of that, those under sanctions should be easily identifiable. Macquisten says the rules will have an effect beyond named individuals. “Within those checks you have to ask if a person is a politically exposed person.” That is a person entrusted with a prominent public function. “From now on, as far as I can see, any Russian buyer, and indeed Ukrainian, would be seen as politically exposed.” On Tuesday the UK banned all exports of art to Russia and Sotheby’s, Christie’s and Bonhams have since been forced to call off their June Russian art auctions. In the States, where auction houses undertake only voluntary anti-money-laundering checks, and most commercial galleries none at all, sanctioned individuals have been found buying art through advisers and a complex arrangement of shell companies. A 2020 Senate subcommittee found Arkady, his son Igor, and Boris Rotenberg, Russians who are under sanctions in America, were able to buy $18m worth of contemporary and modern art at auction and privately. Despite this, the committee only recommended tightening the laws on antiquity deals. Given around 500 super-rich Russians control more wealth than the poorest 99.8%, the vast majority of which is estimated to sit outside Russia, is hitting monied art lovers the most effective weapon in the economic war against Putin? Ramani warns not. “The oligarchs do not have the kind of influence over the executive branch in Russia under Putin that they did under Boris Yeltsin during the 1990s … What could move the needle is the massive devaluing of the Russian currency. The collapse of the Russian economy will bring people out on to the streets. People power is much more powerful than oligarch power in Putin’s Russia.” Yet the Rothschild Fabergé egg offers a picture of how entwined cultural institutions have become with Putin’s Russia. The jewelled objet d’art, from which a diamond-set cockerel pops out the top hourly, was bought by Alexander Ivanov, who made his post-Soviet millions in computers, for $14m at Christie’s London in 2007. His intention for Putin to present the work to the Hermitage Museum was almost thwarted in 2014 when just days before the ceremony, 50 officials, including British HMRC inspectors, raided his private museum in the German spa town of Baden-Baden. Nonetheless, the Hermitage received the jewel from Putin’s hands, enabling them, in turn, to lend it to the V&A, where it sits proudly in Fabergé in London: Romance to Revolution, the museum’s current show dedicated to the company.",Arts/Art and design,‘It’s artwashing’: can galleries wean themselves off Russian oligarch loot?,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/17/artwashing-art-galleries-russian-oligarch-money
3/17/2022,"Marcus Rashford has been dropped from England’s squad for this month’s friendlies against Switzerland and Ivory Coast as a consequence of his poor form for Manchester United. Gareth Southgate has also left out Rashford’s clubmate Jadon Sancho but has given a first call-up to the Crystal Palace defender Marc Guéhi and found spaces for the Palace midfielder Conor Gallagher and Arsenal’s Emile Smith Rowe for the matches at Wembley on 26 and 29 March. Rashford has started three of United’s past 12 Premier League matches and was a substitute in the team’s most recent game, at home to Atlético Madrid in the Champions League, on Tuesday. He is considering asking to leave his boyhood club this summer. Kyle Walker has not made the squad but the goalkeeper Nick Pope is back at expense of Sam Johnstone and Arsenal’s Ben White has been included. Southgate said Walker would return in June, with the Manchester City defender left out to give younger full-backs a chance. Southgate emphasised that Rashford had ample opportunity to get back into his thoughts for the World Cup in Qatar. “It’s a difficult time for him,” he said. “He’s clearly not at his best but there’s plenty of time, we know a lot about Marcus anyway – we know what he can bring to us – and hopefully he can rediscover that form we know he is capable of.” Goalkeepers Jordan Pickford (Everton), Nick Pope (Burnley), Aaron Ramsdale (Arsenal) Defenders Trent Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool), Conor Coady (Wolves), Marc Guehi (Crystal Palace), Reece James (Chelsea), Harry Maguire (Manchester United), Tyrone Mings (Aston Villa), Luke Shaw (Manchester United), John Stones (Manchester City), Ben White (Arsenal) Midfielders Jude Bellingham (Borussia Dortmund), Conor Gallagher (Crystal Palace), Mason Mount (Chelsea), Jordan Henderson (Liverpool), Declan Rice (West Ham), James Ward-Prowse (Southampton) Forwards Tammy Abraham (Roma), Phil Foden (Manchester City), Jack Grealish (Manchester City), Harry Kane (Tottenham Hotspur), Bukayo Saka (Arsenal), Emile Smith Rowe (Arsenal), Raheem Sterling (Manchester City)  The manager explained that Sancho, despite a recent upturn in form, had also not done enough to get in ahead of Phil Foden, Jack Grealish, Bukayo Saka, Raheem Sterling and Smith Rowe. “The other attacking players in the squad are slightly ahead of him in our feeling,” he said. Harry Maguire has been included despite less than impressive form for United and Southgate insisted “it never crossed our mind” not to select a player who was a key part of the teams that reached a World Cup semi-final and European Championship final. “He’s one of our best centre-backs,” he said. Guéhi has been promoted from the Under-21s, with Southgate saying: “He’s had a really consistent season – been very impressed with him on and off the ball. In the biggest games he’s been very calm. We know a lot about him through our development teams as well.”",Sport/Football,Marcus Rashford dropped from England squad and no place for Jadon Sancho ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/17/marcus-rashford-dropped-england-squad-jadon-sancho-gareth-southgate-marc-guehi
3/17/2022,"In Vorzel, a forested district north-west of Kyiv once known for its spas and health clubs and now under Russian occupation, lawyer Ihor Chudovsky spent the first weeks of the invasion documenting the toll of the war on his community – a rocket strike on an orphanage and civilians shot dead in the street. The US president, Joe Biden, on Wednesday called Vladimir Putin a war criminal, drawing the wrath of the Kremlin, for acts such as these. War crimes are grave breaches of the international treaties, conventions and protocols governing armed conflict, such as the disproportionate use of force not justified by military necessity or the deliberate targeting of civilians, and war criminals are those who directly carry out the acts or are judged to have a command responsibility. To prosecute war crimes, whether in a national court or in an international court or tribunal, is far easier when people like Chudovsky record what it is happening, even at risk to themselves. Russian forces started attacking Vorzel on day one of the invasion, in an attempt to control the nearby cargo airport and highways into Kyiv. On March 2, Russian troops entered the town and for eight days no one was allowed to leave. Vorzel’s trapped residents had no heating, intermittent or no electricity, and no access to food and medicine supplies. Russian forces attacked people who tried to leave their houses and tanks rolled down the streets and fired at houses at random. “The [Russians] set up checkpoints around the town, people who went out would be shot at,” said Chudovsky. “There were lots of bodies lying around. There was one old man who went out to smoke, a tank column came past and they shot their guns and, well, that grandad isn’t around anymore. “I received around 20 messages from people asking me, as a lawyer, how they should bury people in these circumstances.” What happened in Vorzel fits a pattern of Russian tactics in the areas they occupy. Tactics which human rights lawyers say amount to war crimes under the Geneva conventions, as well as breaches of international humanitarian law. Russian forces now occupy most of the north-west and central Kyiv region. Speaking over the phone on 28 February, Chudvosky explained how he was documenting war crimes. “I have photos and videos,” he said. Of the orphanage attack, which came on day two of the invasion, he said: “I saw a Russian plane let off a rocket. It hit an orphanage where 50 children were living.” Ukrainian authorities said no children died in the attack but it is unclear if any were injured. Chudvosky said he intended to submit detailed notes and recordings of what he witnessed as evidence for the international criminal court in The Hague, via Ukrainian state prosecutors, who are preparing submissions. Chudvosky said that his evidence will meet the legal standard needed to prosecute, thanks to the 10 years he spent in the police force, followed by 20 years as a practising lawyer, as well as his involvement in the investigation into the 2014 shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 by pro-Russian separatist forces in eastern Ukraine. There is increasing evidence that Russia may be trying to ensure its crimes remain unrecorded by cutting off communications in civilian areas. Residents of villages just south of Chudovsky’s town said that Russian forces confiscated phones after they entered. In one village, Russian soldiers checked people’s phones to ensure tthey were not filming or photographing the soldiers’ actions. It was a pattern repeated in Vorzel, Chudovsky said. “They moved into people’s houses. They took their phones away and said any calls would result in executions.” Chudovsky used his car as a generator to charge his phone and would climb up to his attic to find a mobile signal. Despite his car’s generator, the Guardian lost contact with Chudovsky for four days. On 9 March, he managed to leave through a humanitarian corridor established by the International Red Cross. Ukraine’s State Agency for Communication said on 15 March that they believe Russia has deliberately targeted telecommunications masts and is using jamming devices to prevent civilians in the affected areas from communicating. In the southern city of Mariupol, which has been under siege for almost two weeks, they have also had no phone signal. Hundreds of thousands of people have been trapped without access to food, medicine, water or electricity and hospitals have been targeted with airstrikes. Not being able to communicate has meant that people do not even know about the humanitarian corridors that have been established to evacuate the population. “People are sitting in their basements and simply don’t know what’s going on,” said Dmytro, who declined to give his last name and managed to leave Mariupol after he found out about the corridor through word of mouth. So far, only a few thousand have managed to leave the city of 450,000 people. Mazen Darwish, a Syrian human rights lawyer who helped to lead recent prosecutions against the Syrian regime in Germany, said that the most important step Ukrainians can take towards accountability is to document the crimes. “My advice is not to wait until the UN sends a mission or the ICC starts their investigation,” said Darwish, who has been working on justice for Syrians for the past 11 years. “Ukrainians should know that they are the most important player in the documentation and collecting of evidence.” Nick Waters, the lead for Ukraine at the open-source investigative organisation Bellingcat, said it was actively collecting evidence of attacks on civilians coming out of Ukraine. Like Darwish, he stressed the importance of filming the crime scene but warned Ukrainians not to put themselves in danger by trying to pick up pieces of weapons or publishing it from an identifiable location if they are still under occupation. Waters cited a guide published by the NGO Witness to using video to document human rights abuses. “The big issue with these kinds of images and videos is you never really know who actually originally took them, which is obviously a bit of an issue if you’ve planned to use it in court.” While Chudovsky recorded the airstrikes and attacks, he too became a victim of breaches of international humanitarian law in the form of siege tactics. Russia and the Syrian regime previously used these tactics against Syrian resistance and opposition forces. Those who left before the Russians occupied the town left their keys so that other residents could eat their food. Chudvosky described how in the days before he left he let himself into their empty houses and took food out of the fridges. Some residents have decided to stay in Vorzel because they felt they had nowhere to go, Chudovsky said. Like those who left before him, he and the 25 other residents who went on the same day handed over their keys.",News/World news,‘I saw a rocket hit an orphanage’: the Ukrainians recording possible war crimes,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/i-saw-a-rocket-hit-an-orphanage-the-ukrainians-recording-possible-war-crimes
3/17/2022,"Stephen Hawking’s black hole information paradox has bedevilled scientists for half a century and led some to question the fundamental laws of physics. Now scientists say they may have resolved the infamous problem by showing that black holes have a property known as “quantum hair”. If correct, this would mark a momentous advance in theoretical physics. Prof Xavier Calmet, of the University of Sussex, who led the work, said that after working on the mathematics behind the problem for a decade, his team made a rapid advance last year that gave them confidence that they had finally cracked it. “It was generally assumed within the scientific community that resolving this paradox would require a huge paradigm shift in physics, forcing the potential reformulation of either quantum mechanics or general relativity,” said Calmet. “What we found – and I think is particularly exciting – is that this isn’t necessary.” Hawking’s paradox boils down to the following: the rules of quantum physics state that information is conserved. Black holes pose a challenge to this law because once an object enters a black hole, it is essentially gone for good – along with any information encoded in it. Hawking identified this paradox and for decades it has continued to confound scientists. There have been innumerable proposed solutions, including a “firewall theory” in which information was assumed to burn up before entering the black hole, the “fuzzball theory” in which black holes were thought to have indistinct boundaries, and various exotic branches of string theory. But most of these proposals required rewriting of the laws of quantum mechanics or Einstein’s theory of gravity, the two pillars of modern physics. By contrast, the quantum hair theorem claims to resolve the paradox by bridging the gap between general relativity and quantum mechanics using a new mathematical formulation. The name is a nod to the view, based on classical physics, that black holes can be viewed as surprisingly simple objects, defined only by their mass and speed of rotation. The prediction of bald, featureless black holes has been nicknamed the “no-hair theorem” since the 1970s. Calmet and his collaborators think the black hole is more complex – or hairy. As matter collapses into a black hole, they suggest, it leaves a faint imprint in its gravitational field. This imprint is referred to as “quantum hair” and, the authors say, would provide the mechanism by which information is preserved during the collapse of a black hole. Under this theory, two black holes with identical masses and radii, but with different internal composition, would have very subtle differences in their gravitational fields. “Our solution doesn’t require any speculative idea; instead our research demonstrates that the two theories can be used to make consistent calculations for black holes and explain how information is stored without the need for radical new physics,” said Calmet. There is no obvious way to test the theory through astronomical observations – the gravitational fluctuations would be too tiny to be measurable. But the theory is likely to come under robust scrutiny from the theoretical community. “When you have a big claim you have to back it up,” said Calmet. He added: “It’s going to take some time for people to fully accept this. The paradox has been around for a long time and you’ve got very famous people all over the world who’ve been working on this for years.” The work is published in the journal Physical Review Letters.",News/Science,"‘Quantum hair’ could resolve Hawking’s black hole paradox, say scientists",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/17/quantum-hair-could-resolve-stephen-hawking-black-hole-paradox-say-scientists
3/17/2022,"The Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss was first to go public regarding Roman Abramovich’s desire to sell and to declare an interest in buying the club. He has teamed up with investors including Todd Boehly, an American who part-owns baseball’s LA Dodgers, and Jonathan Goldstein, a British businessman who is the CEO of Cain International and a Tottenham fan. They submitted an offer between £2bn and £2.5bn some days ago and have been confident of winning the race to buy Chelsea but the picture has been complicated by the emergence of new bidders. Boehly was rebuffed by Abramovich when he made an offer for the club in 2019. The Ricketts family, owners of the Chicago Cubs, have joined forces with the hedge fund tycoon Ken Griffin, who is valued by Forbes at $26.5bn (£20.2bn). Griffin is the founder and CEO of Citadel Asset Management but is operating in a private capacity. The Ricketts family, who announced on Wednesday they would bid on Friday, first made an attempt to buy Chelsea in 2018. They believe their success in winning the World Series with the Cubs in 2016 and major redevelopment of the team’s historic Wrigley Field show they would be worthy owners of the Premier League club, whose Stamford Bridge stadium could be renovated. Martin Broughton, a former chairman of British Airways, is planning to front a bid and has support from Sebastian Coe and financial muscle from Creative Artists Agency, a US company whose portfolio includes the football agency Base, and Evolution Media Capital. Broughton, a Chelsea fan, was briefly chairman of Liverpool in 2010 and there would be a seat on the board for Coe, the World Athletics president and a fellow Chelsea supporter, if this offer succeeds. Coe is a former Conservative MP and worked closely with Boris Johnson over the 2012 London Olympics, when the prime minister was the mayor of London. The UK government must approve Chelsea’s sale after imposing sanctions on Abramovich, although the process is being overseen by the US bank Raine. The owner of the NFL’s New York Jets since January 2000 has strong interest in Chelsea and a connection with London. He was appointed as the US ambassador to the UK by Donald Trump in 2017 and soon denied he had suggested his country could buy the NHS. Johnson is said to have developed, or deepened, his love for football, and Chelsea in particular, during his time in that post. He is the billionaire heir to the Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical fortune. The Jets have not made the play-offs in 11 years, the longest current drought in the NFL. The British property tycoon is another Chelsea fan hoping to own the club. He has acknowledged the need to team up with other investors and sources have said he has been approached by several and has the funds in place to bid. Candy this week denied he could team up with Boehly, Wyss and Goldstein, with a spokesperson saying Candy did “not want a lifelong Spurs fan as part of the future ownership of Chelsea”. Candy, a Conservative party donor and property developer, has said he would put a fan on the board and his proposals include plans for an expensive redevelopment of Stamford Bridge. He has enlisted the sports advisory and capital solutions firm Tifosy, co-founded by the former Chelsea player and manager Gianluca Vialli. Saudi Media is described on the website of its parent company, Engineer Holding Group, as “a media representation as well as a sports and event marketing company”. Its bid is being fronted by Mohamed Alkhereiji, another Chelsea fan, who is the CEO at Engineer, founded by his father, Abdulelah. Sources have said, in response to questions regarding a possible Premier League’s owners’ and directors’ test, that Saudi Media has no direct links to the Saudi government. This week, the UK’s sports minister, Nigel Huddlestone, said: “Saudi Arabia is an important partner of the UK in investment, intelligence and culture. We welcome Saudi Arabian investment.” As many as 200 groups have notified Raine of their interest so offers from elsewhere appear likely. Muhsin Bayrak, a Turkish businessman, was said by a representative to have made a bid just under a fortnight ago. Since then Abramovich has been hit by sanctions and Bayrak has been quoted as saying he will submit a fresh offer that reflects the changed circumstances. Josh Harris, the Crystal Palace co-owner, has been linked with a bid. Any takeover by the American would require him to leave Palace. Raine will assess the bids and pick its preferred candidates. The bank is hopeful a deal could go through by the end of this month, with time of the essence because Chelsea are operating under a special licence as a result of the sanctions on Abramovich. At the start of this month the Premier League chief executive, Richard Masters, said: “I think the quickest [sale] we have ever done is 10 days. That’s not to say that record can’t be beaten but normally it takes a number of weeks.”",Sport/Football,The battle to buy Chelsea: what we know about the main bidders,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/17/battle-to-buy-chelsea-bidders-so-far-roman-abramovich
