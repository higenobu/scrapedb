2/2/2022,"My husband and I struggled with when exactly to become parents. Years went by and it never felt like quite right. We were young, living away from our families in London, and renting a small basement flat. We wanted to be settled – in our careers, in a city, living in a place we owned – before we committed to having a child. After all, those seemed like the sort of things parents, actual proper adults, should have. In hindsight, we needn’t have worried as much as we did. Our daughter, and then our sons, were born to two parents who deeply care about them and their wellbeing. Like many parents, we put aside much of our own needs and wants to give our children the best life we could. More than a decade after becoming those shellshocked new parents, we now take more assured steps on our parenting journey. Our children are happy and healthy and thriving.  But of course, like all parents, we worry about whether what we give them is enough. Would it be better if we could afford to send them to private school (even though the notion of private schooling is against both our beliefs)? Should our children be doing more after-school activities? Have we saved enough to give them a financial head-start when they become adults? Worrying about the future, it seems, goes hand in hand with parenting. We worry not just about the sort of people our children will grow up to be, but also whether we have equipped them enough to live happy fulfilling lives. We worry about what sort of world we will be leaving our children and many of these worries feature in our children’s lives too. But ultimately, where does worrying get us? It’s not going to change the future. I started meditating around the time I was to become a mother for the first time and one of the lessons I’ve learned is that I can’t control what’s going to happen down the track, but I can control how I feel about my present. I can control – to some degree at least – what happens in the now. And just as I can’t change the future for my children by worrying about it, I can at least change their present by giving them the best childhood I can. In her book The Philosophical Baby, Alison Gopnik writes about how as parents and caregivers we determine a hugely important aspect of our children’s lives and that’s the childhood we give them. She talks about a project in Michigan where children from deprived backgrounds were given access to dedicated caregivers. The benefits of this were seen 20 to 30 years later when those children had grown up to become “more prosperous, better educated, healthier and less likely to go to jail”. Similarly, Michael Delman in his book Your Kid’s Gonna be Okay writes: “For our children, our patience, kindness and encouragement will pay better dividends than constantly wringing our hands and telling them how anxious we are about them.” All this means that perhaps one of the most important things we can do for our children is to worry less about their future and focus more on their present. As much as we can, we have the power to give our children a childhood that will carry them in good stead for the rest of their lives. In western countries we spend so much of our lives worrying about our children’s future, perhaps to their detriment, as Gopnik has argued in her book The Gardener and the Carpenter. Rather than worrying about their future, perhaps we should be more concerned about what will one day be their past – after all, unlike their future, our children’s past is one thing over which we have some semblance of control. This is not to say that as parents we won’t mess up or that life won’t throw events our way that we can’t control. It also doesn’t mean that we should ignore the foundational needs of our children and not do what we can to set them up for success. But perhaps the worrying and fretting over whether we are doing enough is not as important? The good news is that if you are thinking such things, you’re most likely already an excellent caregiver and have your children’s needs as a priority. Perhaps what’s most important is that we are there for our children, and that no matter how much time in a day we have for them, we try to make sure it is quality time without distractions.

2/2/2022,"Fires, flooding and humidity may have made life hard for many Australians in the last week but it looks like there may be a reprieve as the monsoon system causing havoc across the continent is expected to break apart before the weekend.  A monsoonal weather system swept across the continent dragging with it tropical moisture from the equator that caused massive rainfalls from the far north-west of the country, right into central Australia. An extra 100mm of rain was dumped across some parts of remote South Australia, hampering efforts to restore road and rail lines that had been cut after floods caused by ex-tropical cyclone Tiffany. The situation meant desert communities across Western Australia, SA and the Northern Territory have remained cut off for the last week. Desert communities without food. Alice and Darwin running short. Food bank almost out of supplies. Half of all NT prisoners now with COVID. Is something re: govt supply airlifts happening for the NT or nah? The Royal Australian Air Force began airlifting supplies into Coober Pedy on Monday, while store shelves in other regional centres such as Alice Springs remained bare after the town found itself unreachable by land with a growing Covid outbreak. Though usually a rare event, the rain has caused the Todd River in Alice Springs to flow for the second time in three months. The last time it flowed was 10 November when 100mm of rain fell in 24 hours. Out west, the Kimberley has gone from record making 50.7C temperatures in mid-January to widespread flooding across the region. Areas around Perth and Geraldton may be sweating through temperatures nearing 40C and bracing for bushfires, but Broome recorded more rainfall in the 48 hours from Sunday morning than it did for all 2021, with 564mm of rain. The most extreme conditions were at Country Downs, a cattle station just north of Broome, which recorded 652mm of rain in just 24 hours – more than Melbourne’s annual rainfall – the second highest daily rainfall on record in WA. Jonathan How from the Bureau of Meteorology said the situation across central Australia should improve from Thursday, though the flood waters were likely to persist before draining into inland salt lakes. “Thankfully the rain is easing off on Thursday,” How said. “We are seeing some cooler air coming through. It’s basically cooler air coming up from the Southern Ocean, moving up towards the monsoon, causing it to break apart and move away.” There is also some good news on the way for Queensland, which has sweltered through a one-two-punch of hot weather and high humidity with some areas battered by severe storms overnight. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Warm water in the Coral Sea saw hot, steamy air blow across the Queensland coast these past few days, causing temperatures to feel 5C to 10C hotter than they were. Though the maximum temperature across Brisbane on Tuesday was 34C, the humidity meant it felt closer to 38C. At 9am on Wednesday the temperature was already sitting at 32C, but would have felt more like 37C. This humidity also fuelled thunderstorms across the state, with south-east Queensland lashed by a storm that brought down powerlines in Logan, stripped roofs from buildings and recorded more than 100,000 lightning strikes. A suspected tornado was reported over Browns Plains, causing damage to homes but the Bureau had yet to make the sighting official. “For us to call it a tornado it needs to touch the ground. At this stage we’re calling it a suspected tornado, so we need to confirm that,” How said. The storm also left at least 23,000 people without power, a situation which Nationals MP Matt Canavan quickly blamed on renewable energy saying “green energy can’t keep the lights on”. However, power company Energex said the outages were caused by a vehicle hitting a power pole during the storm and underground cable faults, and had nothing to do with renewables. We're repairing damage which has cut power to more than 21k customers across SEQ, mostly due to storms as well as a vehicle hitting a pole, underground cable faults, & branches in lines. Watch out for fallen lines, stay clear & report ASAP to 13 19 62. #takecarestaylineaware pic.twitter.com/jBT4c8HDQx The energy market regulator AEMO was forced to intervene with its reverse trading mechanism, saying in a statement it would “closely monitor reserve levels to maintain adequate supply as the evening peak-demand period approaches”. Though the Bureau of Meteorology has issued warnings for flash flooding ahead of heavy rain overnight, it is expected this will help clear out the humidity and lower temperatures across Queensland going into the weekend. While these heavy rains may reach areas of northern New South Wales, conditions are not expected to be as severe over Sydney. While down in Melbourne, cooler air means the humidity will have broken as the city heats up over the weekend with an expectation of hitting the low 30s early next week.",News/Environment,Monsoon system wreaking havoc across Australia leaves towns cut off and roads flooded,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/02/monsoon-system-wreaking-havoc-across-australia-leaves-towns-cut-off-and-roads-flooded
