2/1/2022,"Demands by French customs officials over the type of signature they will accept on post-Brexit paperwork has been blamed by UK business leaders for causing long queues of lorries on approach roads to Dover. Two year after Boris Johnson smiled for the cameras, fountain pen in hand over the EU withdrawal agreement, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said a minor disagreement over signatures on customs paperwork had arisen between Britain and France.  William Bain, the head of trade policy at the BCC, said the trade body had heard from UK exporters that French customs officials were demanding a wet signature on border documents for shipments of animals and plant products from the UK. However, he said much of the documentation is produced digitally, creating unexpected holdups on deliveries from Dover to Calais. “One of the issues at Dover currently appears to be linked to the export of food products across the Channel,” Bain said. “Like many of the problems this looks to be down to a differing interpretation of how the trade arrangements work after leaving the EU. “It is the latest in a string of issues with the trade deal that speaks to the wider problems of interpretation, inconsistent application and glaring gaps in its coverage.” The dispute over wet signatures is reminiscent of delays in the 1980s when France ordered that all foreign-made video recorders entering the country be cleared by a nine-person customs depot in Poitiers, hundreds of miles from northern ports where goods shipped from Japan docked. In the two years since Brexit, UK exports to the EU have fallen sharply. Although economists say there are difficulties disentangling the impact from the fallout of Covid-19, which has caused severe disruption to global trade, Britain appears to have been hit harder than comparable advanced economies. According to the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, UK exports in November were 12.9% below their 2018 average level. By contrast, data for October from the Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis in the Netherlands showed real goods exports from advanced economies were 1% above their 2018 average The BCC said that on the second anniversary of Brexit, and with “huge lorry queues” reported at Dover last week, urgent action to improve trade with Europe was required. It said three-fifths of UK exporters (60%) it surveyed in November reported difficulties in trading with the EU, up from 49% in January 2021. The UK government introduced full customs controls on EU imports from 1 January 2022, ending a grace period designed to smooth the transition from Brexit. Gareth Thomas, the shadow minister for international trade, said ministers needed to prioritise reducing red tape and delays. “If ministers won’t act on the chamber’s ideas they need to explain quickly what they are going to do to keep trade flowing.” Bain said it was possible for the UK and the EU to take pragmatic steps towards reach new understandings on the consistent interpretation of the post-Brexit trade and cooperation agreement. “No-one is expecting goods to flow as freely across the channel now as they did prior to Brexit. But the way the trade agreement is being interpreted in 27 different EU countries is a major headache for UK business – especially smaller firms without the cash reserves to set up new EU based arrangements.”",News/Politics,Dover holdups blamed on signature row with French customs,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/31/dover-holdups-blamed-on-signature-row-with-french-customs-post-brexit-paperwork
2/1/2022,"The government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, is to become the next chair of the Natural History Museum, a position he is understood to be taking on in addition to his current roles. Vallance has been a key figure in informing the government’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, most notably around understanding the risks and mitigation of the virus and prioritising vaccine development. He said he had loved the museum since he was a young boy.  He is expected to join its board of trustees in October and become its non-executive chairman in early 2023, taking over from Lord Stephen Green. He said: “I have loved the museum since first visiting as a young child. It inspired me to pursue a career in science and continues to inspire wonder in visitors of all ages as well as being a world-leading scientific research institute. “I am hugely looking forward to the opportunity to contribute to its continuing success.” The Natural History Museum is based in South Kensington, London and also has another site at Tring in Hertfordshire. Dr Douglas Gurr, the director of the Natural History Museum, said: “The Natural History Museum is well known as a much-loved visitor attraction but is also a world-leading scientific research centre working on solutions for the planetary emergency – from biodiversity loss to climate change. “We are thrilled that Sir Patrick will be joining to drive forward our mission of creating advocates for the planet and building a world in which both people and planet can thrive.” The appointment was made by the board of trustees of the Natural History Museum, and endorsed by Boris Johnson and the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries. Dorries said Vallance had been “an extraordinary, dedicated servant to the nation during the coronavirus pandemic,” adding that he would bring a wealth of experience to “help the museum take its important work forward and inspire more people from all backgrounds to pursue an interest in natural history.” Vallance was the chief scientific adviser to the Cop26 climate summit, and leads the Net Zero Innovation Board, which supports the drive to cut emissions to zero overall by 2050. He previously headed up research and development at GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and before that was a clinical academic, professor of medicine, and led the division of medicine at UCL. He has also been a consultant physician in the NHS.",News/UK news,Sir Patrick Vallance to become chair of Natural History Museum,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/31/sir-patrick-vallance-to-become-chair-of-natural-history-museum
2/1/2022,"The Pulitzer-prize winning Holocaust graphic novel Maus: A Survivor’s Tale has become a bestseller on Amazon, after a Tennessee school board banned it. Last week, according to meeting minutes, 10 school board members in McMinn county agreed to remove Maus from the eighth-grade curriculum, citing “rough, objectionable language” and sketches of naked women they deemed unsuitable for 13-year-old students.  By the American cartoonist Art Spiegelman and first published in 1986, Maus describes the experiences of Spiegelman’s parents in Nazi concentration camps and his mother’s suicide. The book depicts Jewish people as mice and Nazis as cats. “We don’t need to enable or somewhat promote this stuff,” McMinn county board member Tony Allman said, adding in reference to the murder of 6 million Jewish people in the second world war: “I am not denying it was horrible, brutal and cruel.” “It shows people hanging,” he said. “It shows them killing kids. Why does the education system promote this kind of stuff? It is not wise or healthy.” Another board member, Mike Cochran, said: “If I was trying to indoctrinate somebody’s kids, this is how I would do it. You put this stuff just enough on the edges, so the parents don’t catch it but the kids, they soak it in. I think we need to relook at the entire curriculum.” Spiegelman, 73, told CNBC he was “baffled”. “It’s leaving me with my jaw open, like, ‘What?’” he said, adding that the board was acting in “Orwellian” fashion. “I’ve met so many young people who … have learned things from my book,” he said. “I also understand that Tennessee is obviously demented. There’s something going on very, very haywire there.” As news of the McMinn ban spread, Maus shot onto multiple top 10 lists in Amazon book categories. As of Monday morning, The Complete Maus was second in Amazon’s overall bestseller category. In history, it ranked first. In second world war history, Maus I, the first installment of the novel, also ranked No 1. Variations took the first, second and third spots as bestsellers in literary graphic novels. Efforts have also emerged to make Maus more accessible to students. One professor at a North Carolina college offered eighth-grade and high-school students in McMinn county a free online class. “In response to Spiegelman’s Maus I and Maus II being removed from the schools by McMinn county, Tennessee school board members, I am offering this free online course for any McMinn county eighth-grade or high school students interested in reading these books with me,” said Scott Denham of Davidson College. “I have taught Spiegelman’s books many times in my courses on the Holocaust over many years,” he added, on his website. Richard Davis, owner of the Nirvana Comics bookstore in Knoxville, Tennessee, offered to loan The Complete Maus to any student. Davis also set up a GoFundMe campaign to buy additional copies. Created with a target of $20,000, it had raised more than $80,000 by Monday. “Art Spiegelman’s masterpiece is one of the most important, impactful and influential graphic novels of all time,” the page said. “We believe it is a must-read for everyone.”",News/World news,Holocaust book Maus hits bestseller list after Tennessee school board ban,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/31/holocaust-novel-maus-bestseller-after-tennessee-school-ban

2/1/2022,"Tottenham confirmed the signings of Rodrigo Bentancur and Dejan Kulusevski from Juventus on a busy deadline day for the club. Their arrivals came as Dele Alli agreed a permanent move to Everton and Tanguy Ndombele joined Lyon, becoming the first of several players expected to depart on loan.  Juventus announced that Bentancur had moved for an initial €19m (£15.8m), with another €6m in potential add-ons. The 24-year-old Uruguay midfielder, who has 46 caps, has a contract to 2026. Kulusevski has joined on an 18-month loan, for which Spurs are paying €10m, with an obligation to make the move permanent for €35m if certain objectives are met. The 21-year-old can play on the wing or as a No 10. Alli’s move to Everton is due to go through, subject to a medical, on the day Frank Lampard was confirmed as the new manager at Goodison Park. Everton are taking Alli on a free but will pay £10m for him after 20 appearances, and add-ons could take the fee to about £30m. Lyon confirmed they had paid a €1.42m to take Ndombele back, with an option to make the move permanent for a fee understood to be €65m.

2/1/2022,"A Connecticut mayor has ordered two police officers placed on administrative leave amid scrutiny over the alleged mishandling of investigations of the deaths of two Black women. According to family members, investigations into the deaths of Lauren Smith-Fields, 23, and Brenda Lee Rawls, 53, both on 21 December, were mishandled by officers who did not investigate in a timely manner or notify relatives.  Smith-Fields was found unresponsive in her apartment after a date with a man she met through the dating app Bumble. The man, who is white and whose name has not been released as he has not been charged with a crime, called 911. Police did not notify Smith-Fields’ family. When she did not respond to text messages or calls, her mother and brother drove to her apartment. They found a note on her door reading: “If you’re looking for Lauren, call this number.” Smith-Fields’ landlord subsequently told her family about her death and passed on the number of the detective assigned. When Smith-Fields’ family asked officers about the man who was with her, her mother told the New York Times, the investigating detective said not to worry and that “he’s a really nice guy”. Amid widespread outrage, a medical examiner said Smith-Fields died from an accidental overdose of fentanyl combined with prescription medication and alcohol. The acting Bridgeport police chief, Rebeca Garcia, said police were now focusing on “the factors that led to her untimely death”. Confirmation of the cause of Rawls’ death is pending, according to the Connecticut chief medical examiner. She was reportedly found unresponsive by an acquaintance who said her body was taken by police and coroner’s officials. Family members were not notified directly by law enforcement. After calls to police, hospitals and funeral homes, the state medical examiner, who had already performed an autopsy, confirmed her death. “It’s almost like they’re not aware of her death, or they just don’t care and that made us angry,” Dorothy Washington, Rawl’s sister, told CNN. “She was raised and born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, paid her taxes, voted and they treated like she was nothing. Like she was roadkill.” On Sunday, Joseph Ganim, the mayor of Bridgeport, shared his condolences with the families of the two women. He was, he said, “extremely disappointed with the leadership of the Bridgeport police department”. Ganim also called for disciplinary action against the two officers, “for lack of sensitivity to the public and failure to follow police policy”. “The Bridgeport police department has high standards for officer sensitivity, especially in matters involving the death of a family member,” Ganim said. “It is an unacceptable failure if policies were not followed. “To the families, friends and all who care about the human decency that should be shown in these situations in this case by members of the Bridgeport police department, I am very sorry.” Bridgeport police did not immediately comment.",News/US news,Two Connecticut officers put on leave over handling of Black women’s deaths,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/31/connecticut-officers-mishandling-investigation-black-women-deaths
2/1/2022,"The much-anticipated report by the civil servant Sue Gray was finally published on Monday, but with a police inquiry now under way it was limited in what it could say. Here we looks at the questions it failed – or was unable – to answer.  Gray’s report doesn’t go close to naming who the police may wish to talk to, but there is an implicit suggestion that the prime minister is among those being investigated because of two events that are being examined. The two events – one in his private flat and one garden party he attended – have been judged serious breaches of lockdown and are among those the police are investigating. Johnson has always denied hosting events in his Downing Street flat, but the wording of Gray’s report suggests there is no ambiguity here. In other circumstances, Gray would have been expected to name Johnson and other senior No 10 figures who were responsible for the failings she identifies. Whitehall sources suggest she had the option of doing so but she has instead not named any of those she might have censured if she had more freedom. There are some hints of whom she might have criticised or found mitigations for. She writes: “Too much responsibility and expectation is placed on the senior official whose principal function is the direct support of the prime minister. This should be addressed as a matter of priority.” This is understood to refer to Martin Reynolds, Johnson’s principal private secretary. Whitehall sources have always made clear that lists of junior officials who attended each event were never likely to be published, though HR disciplinary processes could follow and those officials could receive penalty charge notices. But there is an expectation that it might be disproportionate to allow all those names to become public. The question of who organised the events is a different story, and throws the spotlight on Reynolds, who sent an email inviting people to summer drinks, and other senior staff who organised leaving or Christmas parties. There is also a question about the flat party – should the Met now investigate the PM’s wife, Carrie Johnson? There is no focus on the prime minister’s claim that he thought “implicitly” that the May 2020 “bring your own booze” party organised in the Downing Street garden by his senior aide was a work meeting. But Gray does make some acknowledgment that the garden was used for work meetings. That is not necessarily accepted as an excuse. Indeed, Gray finds that it was potentially inappropriate. “The use of the garden at No 10 Downing Street should be primarily for the prime minister and the private residents of No 10 and No 11 Downing Street,” she writes. “During the pandemic it was often used as an extension of the workplace as a more Covid-secure means of holding group meetings in a ventilated space. This was a sensible measure that staff appreciated, but the garden was also used for gatherings without clear authorisation or oversight. This was not appropriate. Any official access to the space, including for meetings, should be by invitation only and in a controlled environment.”",News/Politics,Questions still to be answered after release of Sue Gray report,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/31/questions-still-to-be-answered-after-release-of-sue-gray-report
2/1/2022,"“Ithink the whole tour is one where the development of our game is actually more important than the series win,” Eoin Morgan said before a ball was bowled. “Our level of intensity and our performance is far more important than the result, and actually the result looks after itself.” The results did not, in the end, look after themselves. England leave Barbados defeated 3-2 in the T20 series but having participated in some gripping sport in front of boisterous crowds. There is no shame in providing compelling entertainment and after a lopsided opening match, when on a poor pitch England were bowled out for 103 and West Indies won with ease, this series was tense throughout.  As well as featuring two well-matched sides its success was largely down to scheduling. This was just the 14th five-game bilateral T20 series and it demonstrated how they allow narratives to emerge and intensity to build in a way that is impossible when there are fewer matches (England’s T20 series against India and South Africa this summer will consist of three games, as will West Indies’ in India next month). Once the dust has settled and minds dizzied by an unforgettable conclusion have refocused on the medium-term goal of October’s T20 World Cup, Morgan might struggle to identify the positives he hoped for. England’s captain missed three matches through injury, games where he would have hoped to reestablish his batting credentials, while players whose strengths are well known demonstrated those strengths – Adil Rashid in particular was outstanding – players with acknowledged weaknesses had those weaknesses exposed, and the ones we knew little about we learned little about. The series was not a good one for England’s batters. Including Akeal Hosein, who scored an unbeaten 44 in his only innings, West Indies had eight players whose batting average was equal to or, in most cases, significantly better than England’s best – and only 12 of their players batted. Jason Roy was England’s most consistent performer but often scored with uncharacteristic sluggishness at the start of his innings and ended with a strike rate of 130, not exactly shameful but his second-lowest in any series since 2016. The other opener, Tom Banton, admitted that “I’m not going to fit in the strongest team at the moment so I’m just trying my best to one day hopefully be able to cement my position at the top” and did enough to suggest that one day he might. Of the squad’s other emerging talents three made their debuts in the third match of whom only one played more than once: Phil Salt’s 24-ball 57 was followed by two failures which, considering he was forced by circumstance into instant wild attacking, are forgivable. It would surely be worth experimenting with putting him higher up the order over the summer. With the exception of Reece Topley, whose return to the side after an absence of nearly six years exceeded all expectations, England’s seamers struggled. In Sunday’s series decider West Indies scored 45-4 in 10 overs against spin and 122-0 against seam. The death bowling was regularly savaged, and while Chris Jordan and Tymal Mills hemorrhaged runs in the final overs, Saqib Mahmood leaked runs everywhere. Other than Topley, the only English seamers to end the series with their reputations enhanced were the absent Jofra Archer and Mark Wood. West Indies entered the series at the lowest of ebbs, humbled in their defence of the World T20 title last year and beaten at home by Ireland in an ODI series. For all that they faced a weakened England side and beat them narrowly, they travel to India with team, and hope, refreshed. “After losing to Ireland everyone was very, very down and deflated,” the West Indies allrounder, Jason Holder, said. “Everybody had to do some soul-searching, and feeling the way we did really made us pull together. It’s one of the first times I’ve felt that strong togetherness in the dressing room.” During the series Holder beat his previous highest score with the bat, as did Hosein, Kyle Mayers, Nicholas Pooran, Rovman Powell and Romario Shepherd. Well led by Kieron Pollard, they played with intensity and ability – and the results looked after themselves.",Sport/Sport,T20 series designed to give answers only posed questions for England | Simon Burnton,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/31/a-series-designed-to-provide-answers-only-posed-questions-for-england
2/1/2022,"Customers of the UK’s biggest banks and building societies will be able to continue to use Post Office counters to pay in and withdraw cash, after an important arrangement was renewed. Following months of negotiations, the Post Office has announced that it will continue to offer basic banking services to most UK bank customers for a further three years. Had the negotiations failed, it would have left millions of people without reasonable access to cash withdrawals.  The service, described as a “lifeline” for the millions of people and small businesses that rely on cash, allows customers at 30 banks and building societies to deposit cheques/cash at Post Office counters. The new agreement will see this remain until at least the end of 2025. The new deal, which covers three years from next January, is seen as key in securing the future acceptance of cash. Almost 98% of the population live within three miles of a Post Office, which tend to have longer opening hours than banks, with about 4,000 open at weekends. In December, the consumer group Which? claimed that almost half of the UK’s bank branches had been lost, or scheduled for closure, since 2015. The closures have left a number of towns without a functioning bank. Many smaller communities have lost access to free-to-use ATMs. More than £3bn a month of cash is deposited and withdrawn every month from the Post Office’s 11,500 branches. Nick Read, chief executive at the Post Office, said: “This agreement provides a continued lifeline to the millions of people and small businesses that rely on cash nationwide. It highlights the unique and vital role that the country’s Post Offices play in local communities and economies. “While banks are cutting their branch networks, Post Offices are seeing more and more deposits and withdrawals with Postmasters keeping their branches open long hours and helping to draw people to our high streets.” The online bank Monzo is the only big-name UK bank not to sign up to the initiative. The branchless bank allows customers to deposit cash using Paypoint, which is available in over 28,000 convenience stores. Last October, Lloyds Banking Group said it would close 41 Lloyds Bank and seven Halifax branches across England and Wales between January and April 2022. That came on top of 100 closures earlier in the year. Several weeks later TSB announced it was closing 70 branches – a quarter of its network, meaning it had more than halved the number of outlets it had over less than two years.",Lifestyle/Money,Deal renewed for banking customers to use Post Office branches,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/31/deal-renewed-for-banking-customers-to-use-post-office-branches
2/1/2022,"There are two highly anticipated new cookbooks that won’t be troubling Pinch of Nom’s position at the top of the charts any time soon – after they sank to the bottom of the ocean. New copies of Mason Hereford’s Turkey and the Wolf, which collects recipes from Hereford’s award-winning New Orleans restaurant, and Melissa Clark’s one-pot cookbook Dinner in One, were being transported on cargo ship The Madrid Bridge, which lost around 60 containers overboard in the mid-Atlantic earlier this month.  Sharing the news with his would-be readers, Hereford appeared to be taking the loss in good spirits, describing it as “perhaps the most hilariously 2022 thing to happen yet this year”. “There was a container collapse on the cargo ship that contained the Turkey and the Wolf books. The good news is that there were no critical injuries, as can happen in these situations. But the bad news is the books might be in a cargo container at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean,” said Hereford on Instagram. The new release date for Hereford’s cookbook, which contains recipes including “potato chip–loaded fried bologna sandwiches, deviled-egg tostadas with salsa macha, and his mom’s burnt tomato casserole”, is 21 June. The title had originally been due out in February. Clark’s Dinner in One, featuring recipes for Miso-Glazed Salmon with Roasted Sugar Snap Peas, Cheesy Meatball Parm with Spinach and Cheaters Chicken and Dumplings, is also currently residing at the bottom of the ocean, and is thus also delayed, in Clark’s case until 6 September. “There was a maritime storm. Containers were crushed, some fell overboard. My cookbook, along with@turkeyandthewolf’s cookbook, is MIA on the wine-dark sea,” wrote Clark on Instagram. “I like to think that if the books are at the bottom of the ocean, they’re teaching whole schools of fish some very tasty recipes.

2/1/2022," Film, 2021, Australia – out 4 February Noni Hazlehurst delivers an excellent, multifaceted performance as June, a woman suffering from dementia, who one day suddenly and inexplicably recovers. The catch? Her newfound lucidity won’t last long. So June escapes her nursing home to reconnect with her family, only to discover circumstances have changed for the worse, creating for her a kind of bizarro reality, sort of familiar and sort of not. A world conceptually similar to that experienced by the protagonist of the Australian film (and novel) Bliss. If the premise sounds heavy, writer/director JJ Winlove’s film has a lightness of touch. It’s frequently funny, warm, but also prickly around the edges, with well drawn characters and a great cast including Hazlehurst, Claudia Karvan and Stephen Curry. TV, 2022, US – out 3 February Will Arnett has some big runs on the board – including and especially BoJack Horseman and Arrested Development. Based on the British sitcom Murder in Successville, the trailer for his procedural crime comedy about butter-fingered senior detective Terry Seattle (Arnett) looks pretty goofy, which is perhaps to be expected. This is a semi-improvised show, with a different celebrity playing Seattle’s offsider to help solve a crime each episode, but the celebrities (including Sharon Stone, Kumail Nanjiani and Conan O’Brien) don’t get a script. Netflix claims it is “Law & Order meets Whose Line Is It Anyway?” TV, 2021, Australia – out 16 February Edgy humour often involves satirising the cultural mores of the time, which is a particularly fraught exercise with modern minefields including identity politics and cancel culture. Creators Naomi Higgins, Humyara Mahbub and Mark Bonanno go where many fear to tread, producing uncomfortable comedy through the story of a trio of opportunistic gen Zers – Mia (Olivia Junkeer), Penny (Higgins) and Austin (Wil King) – who exploit positive societal progress to serve their own interests. After arriving on iView last year, season one is finally on Australian Netflix this month. Hopefully the ABC commissions a second season to nurture original, incisive young voices.

Will Smith saw the video, liked the idea and voilà – a new series arrives with a semi-autobiographical twang, starring Jabari Banks as a semi-fictional version of Smith himself. Film, UK/US, 2013 – out 9 February A film consisting entirely of Tom Hardy driving a car, never once leaving the car, and with no other actors and no sets may not sound like the best time. But Hardy and writer/director Steven Knight do a bang-up job building and sustaining interest throughout this highly ambitious and tightly constructed dialogue-driven drama about a construction worker who drives to London to be with a woman (voiced by Olivia Colman) about to give birth to a child they conceived during a one night stand.

TV, 2022, US – out 4 February Like the Tom Cruise movies Jack Reacher and Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, this eight-part action thriller is based on author Lee Child’s Jack Reacher books, following a former military major who frequently finds himself in rather precarious cloak-and-dagger situations. This time the protagonist is played by the very buff Alan Ritchson, presenting a version of the character who swings his fists, frowns a lot and can open screw cap bottles by pressing them against his biceps. Film, 2012, US – out 1 February Robert Zemeckis’ underrated 2012 drama opens with a spectacular white-knuckle plane crash sequence in which the pilot, Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington), performs a daring crash landing after a mechanical error. He flips the plane, realigns it, and saves almost everybody on board. A bona fide hero, right? But Whitaker, a drug user and alcoholic, was three sheets to the wind at the time. Which leads to a bold question: what if being drunk gave him the audacity to pull the manoeuvre that saved almost everybody? It is an intriguing, potentially fraught way to approach the issue of drug use, in a film that is ultimately about a man confronting his demons and overcoming his addictions. Honourable mentions: Central Intelligence (film, 1 February), Cast Away (film, 1 February), Beverly Hills Cop 1 and 2 (film, 1 February), Overlord (film, 1 February), Into the Wild (film, 1 February), It’s a Wonderful Life, (film, 1 February), Scrooged (film, 1 February), Ted (film, 1 February), The Fame (film, 1 February), The Truman Show (film, 1 February), The Witch (film, 1 February), School of Rock (film, 1 February) The Marvelous Mrs Maisel season 4 (TV, 18 February), Phat Tuesdays (TV, 4 February), I Want You Back (TV, 11 February). TV, UK/US, 2022 – out 16 February Rose Matafeo – whose oeuvre includes Baby Done and Squinters – is such a funny, charming and relatable presence, you never want to stop being around her. The New Zealand comedian created, wrote and stars in the thoroughly bingeable Starstruck, playing a woman living in London who discovers her one night stand is a super famous movie star (Nikesh Patel). This triggers a “will they or won’t they?” romantic back and forth that never gets old. Fingers crossed the second season is as good as the first. TV, Australia, 2022 – out 27 February Now that Jack Irish has finished and Guy Pearce has hung up his cape (well, cardigan) as one of Australian TV’s greatest private eyes, there is space for new players. Enter former police officer Ted Conkaffey (Thomas Jane) and ex-con Amanda Pharrell (Nicole Chamoun), who partner up to solve the disappearance of a Korean tech pioneer. Shot in Queensland and directed by veteran Jocelyn Moorhouse (whose work includes the superb Wakefield), Troppo is based on Candice Fox’s bestselling novel Crimson Lake. Honourable mentions: Good Grief (film, 9 February), Dementia and Us (TV, 15 February), How to Paint the Mona Lisa (TV, 16 February), The Missing Children (TV, 28 February). Film, China, 2018 – out 5 February You may not have heard of director Zhang Yimou’s visually ravishing epic, but it was the best action movie of 2018, offering a genuinely fresh aesthetic experience. Inspired by Chinese ink brush paintings and the tai chi diagram, the production was shot in colour but filled with black and white sets and costumes, with almost all of its colour coming from the actors’ skin. Set during the Three Kingdoms era of Chinese legend (AD220-AD290), the narrative involves a bad-tempered king (Zheng Kai) and a commander (Deng Chao) who rallies against him. Unbeknown to the king, the commander is actually a doppelganger or “shadow”, with the real commander (also Deng Chao) wounded and in hiding. Film, China, 1985 – out now Jackie Chan is to movie martial arts what Charlie Chaplin was to silent comedy – pure physical genius. A decade on from the international superstar’s retirement announcement, nobody has come remotely close to filling his shoes, making it abundantly clear (if it wasn’t already) that history will remember him as a true one of a kind. Chan co-wrote, co-directed, starred in and of course performed his own stunts for this rolled-gold 80s classic about a kung fu police officer who must protect a witness (Bridgett Lin) from being killed by gangsters before being able to testify against them. Like many of his films, the final credits scene of Police Story includes a combination of outtakes, bloopers and behind-the-scenes footage. SBS on Demand has a ton of other Jackie Chan films to stream including Police Story 2, Armour of God, The Young Master and Wheels on Meals. Honourable mentions: Hidden Assets (TV, 2 February), Burning (film, 3 February), The Long Call (TV, 3 February), Educators seasons one and two (TV, 10 February), Devilsdorp (TV, 10 February), 12 Years a Slave (film, 22 February), The Light Between Oceans (film, 23 February), Hope (TV, 24 February). TV, UK, 2021 – out 10 February In this four-part series based on the 2016 novel of the same name, Jane (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) moves into a sleek, ultra modern house after being interviewed by the architect/landlord himself, the mysterious Edward (David Oyelowo). He offers cheap rent with certain stipulations – the tenant must have few belongings and no kids. When Jane discovers a previous renter, who looked just like her, died at the house, she becomes a wee bit distraught and starts asking questions. But is her resemblance to the deceased woman merely a coinkydink? I learned that very fun word while reading Lucy Mangan’s review, immediately vowing to use it in as many places as possible going forward. Coinkydink! Film, US, 2020 – out 11 February I remember the name of the first (sadly now defunct) Facebook group I joined – “People who talk during movies deserve to get their tongues ripped out”. In John Krasinski’s well made smash-hit horror movies, people who make noise kind of do get their tongues ripped out and worse – getting quickly and gruesomely killed by vicious, blind aliens with an amazing sense of hearing. The catch, sadly, is that people in this world can’t watch movies either, unless they turn the volume right down. Krasinski shows a knack for sustaining suspense in both films, including the sequel, which follows the Abbott family’s continual struggle to survive (and stay silent) in a post-apocalyptic world. Honourable mentions: Raised by Wolves season 2 (TV, 3 February), An American Pickle (film, 4 February) Modern Family seasons 1-11 (film, 9 February), My Year with Helen (film, 15 February), The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part (film, 18 February), Dream Horse (film, 18 February), The Last Impresario (film, 21 February), Aretha Franklin (film, 24 February), Driving Miss Daisy (film, 25 February), Phar Lap (film, 25 February), Old (film, 27 February). TV, 2022, US – out 2 February We were all expecting something salacious, with wobbly bits and super attractive celebrities but Pam & Tommy delivered so much more. It is, among other things, a shrewd comedy, a crime drama and a history lesson of the early days of the internet centred around a cultural artefact (OK – sex tape) that arrived prior to the era of high-speed video streaming. Spending time in the company of the titular characters (played by Lily James and Sebastian Stan) is kind of fun and kind of irritating – their vacuousness infects everything. But creator and writer Robert D Siegel finds numerous ways into the story, including through an aggrieved electrician (played with broad appeal by Seth Rogen) who steals the infamous tape then tries to work out what to do with it. Film, 2021, US – out 2 February Wes Anderson’s print journalism-inspired anthology film, set in the newsroom of an US publication in a fictitious French city, is far from the director’s best work – but it’s another opportunity to savour one of the most visually distinctive auteur’s working today. Expect a fastidiously arranged aesthetic and a stellar cast including Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Tilda Swinton, Timothée Chalamet, Frances McDormand and Anjelica Huston. Honourable mentions: Torn (film, 4 February), The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder (TV, 23 February), No Exit (film 25 February), The Kid (film, 25 February). TV, US, 2022 – out 15 February The first instalment in this anthology series about overlooked women in the civil rights movement – created by Marissa Jo Cerar and executive produced by Jay-Z and Will Smith – revolves around the brutal murder of Emmett Till in 1955, and the story of his mother, Mamie (Adrienne Warren), who famously resolved to “let the people see what they did to my boy”. Guardian reviewer Adrian Horton described the show as one that, at its best, “provocatively explores a chapter of American history most don’t know enough about with sensitivity, faithfulness and care not to exploit trauma”.

2/1/2022,"This year hasn’t exactly got off to a roaring start for most people. 2022 feels more like, as one friend put it: “2020 – the trilogy”. As much as we’re hungry for change, many of us do not have the energy to make big, sweeping shifts; and even if we did, it’s entirely possible that the world will have other plans. So, what little things can we do to feel better right now? This January, Guardian Australia staff and contributors embarked on a month of easy wins – sharing the small discoveries and changes that improved their lives. Some involved giving back, some giving yourself a break, and a few involved personal admin – because if you just need to achieve something, anything, you can always turn to paperwork.  If you’re looking for somewhere to start, treat this as an incrementalist, feelgood laundry list. Try one, or try the lot – whatever feels easy for you. 1. Do something nice for yourself first thing in the morning. Whether your bliss looks like a bubble bath, a good book, a run or a video game, make it the first thing you do when you wake up, even if it’s only for five minutes. 2. Chronic people-pleasers, listen to this one: write a not-to-do list. When you find yourself trapped in a commitment you loathe, write it down. Keeping a list will help you remember to say no next time. 3. Dress like a seven-year-old. It’s fun, it saves you from fashion agony, and no one knows what to wear now anyway. 4. Extend your on-foot commute. Getting off the bus a stop or two early will certainly lift your step count, and it might just lift your spirits too. 5. Want to cut down on booze? Impose alcohol free days. A hard rule about when you can’t drink will give your body a break, and might make you more mindful on the days you do indulge. 6. Remember caffeine has a quarter life of 10-12 hours, and stop drinking it after midday. Cutting out out afternoon coffee and tea is a gamechanger for troubled sleepers. And if you’re really lucky, you could even replace that 2pm piccolo with a nap. 7. Do kegels while the kettle boils. For men and women, a strong pelvic floor is core to all sorts of bodily functions (including fun ones like orgasms). Look after yours by incorporating a few minutes of exercises into your existing routine – you can do them anywhere. 8. If you’re having problems like acne, dryness or redness, treat your skin like what it is – the largest organ in your body – and ask your doctor for help. A scientifically-sound skincare plan might involve a script or two, but it will be more effective (and maybe cheaper) in the long run than experimenting willy-nilly at the cosmetics counter. 9. You don’t have to sit still to meditate. Much like pelvic floor exercises, meditation can be incorporated into all sorts of daily activities. “When you give something the awareness and concentration to realise its causes and effects, that is meditation,” writes Bertin Huynh. 10. Do a cool down without the workout. You’ll benefit from a few stretches or mobility exercises any time of day, but they’re particularly good before bed. 11. Speaking of night-time routines, read for six minutes before bed. 12. Renegotiate a bill. We might think loyalty is a trait to be rewarded, but when it comes to your utilities, insurance and other regular bills, it can be costly.. Contact your provider and call them out for it. 13. For an instant drop in stress levels, switch your Siri to the voice of an Irish man. It just sounds so much nicer. 14. This one is a bit of a pain at first, but the rewards are ongoing: set up a password manager. You’ll never have to remember a stack of random passwords again – or worse yet, use the same one for everything. 15. Consolidate your superannuation. It takes less than five minutes and could compound into a more comfortable retirement. 16. Keep your memories private by archiving your social media history. It will allow you to hide whatever you want from prying eyes, while still retaining a copy for your own records. 17. Buy imperfect produce. It may not look as cute, but it’s cheaper, better for the planet and tastes just the same. 18. If your pantry is causing you panic, clear it out one shelf at a time. An orderly and decluttered fridge or store cupboard will make your life more pleasant, but that doesn’t mean you have to do it all at once. 19. Learn to make chilli oil. It goes with basically everything. 20. While you’re at it, learn to make dal. It’s healthy, easy and freezes well – so a pot tonight is a gift for your future self. 21. Plant an edible garden. Nothing tastes better than food you’ve grown yourself, and you’ll only need to tend to it five minutes a day. 22. Instead of frantically Googling what to cook for dinner every night, keep a written copy of your favourite recipes on file. 23. Or, prepare even further in advance and meal plan before you go grocery shopping. It’ll prevent that weird situation where your pantry is “simultaneously full of food … without the constituent parts to make a decent meal”. 24. If you miss having a coin jar that actually gets full, set up a round-up savings account. 25. Find a good tailor. Your clothes will look better because they fit better, and they’ll last longer because they’ll be fixed when they break. 26. You can’t mindlessly scroll what you can’t open: delete your social media apps from your phone. 27. Set up a throwaway email. Rather than climbing a mountain of unsubscribe buttons, if you use a different email address for commercial transactions, you’ll never have to deal with the ensuing spam. 28. Keep yourself organised the old fashioned way, and use a no frills, lo-fi notebook. 29. Get in touch with an old friend. A weird time to be alive is a good time to reach out – don’t worry if you’re in email debt or missed their last birthday, they probably feel the same way. 30. Directly help someone, with something your body makes for free, by giving blood. How else can you save three lives in 10 minutes? 31. Set up a monthly charitable donation. Automating your philanthropy is quick, easy and better for the charity, because their cashflow is more predictable. Have you tried any of our easy wins?

2/1/2022,"On Wednesday evening, in the first event of the 2022 Winter Olympics, Australians Tahli Gill and Dean Hewitt will make history. That is no mean feat. Representing a country with a proud Olympic record, there are few firsts left to be claimed in the green and gold uniform: Australia has competed at the Summer Games since federation and the Winter Games since 1936. But when the pair step out on to the ice for their opening encounter in the mixed doubles, they will become Australia’s first-ever Olympic curlers. Hailing from a country without a single dedicated curling facility, Gill and Hewitt’s road to Beijing has not been easy. At the Games they will be up against the sport’s heavyweights. “I think given we’re not a typical curling nation, we are probably considered an underdog,” says Gill. “It’s a strong field, every single team there is really good. But that means that any team could come out on top.” Including, potentially, Australia. “For everyone at the Olympics, you want to try and get a medal – that would be fantastic,” adds Hewitt. “We’re just going to push as hard as we can every game and see what we can do out there.”  Curling was first played in Scotland in the early 16th century, with large, flat-bottomed rocks slid over frozen lakes. Today it typically takes place indoors on artificial ice-rinks and is popular in many cool-climate nations; Canada, Sweden, Switzerland, Norway and Great Britain dominate the sport competitively. “There is a lot involved: the precision, the power and endurance from sweeping as well,” says Hewitt. “And the strategy behind it is huge, the mental game is really important. It’s chess on ice, but we have to play really quickly – you’re on the clock.” So how did two Australians, Gill from sunny Queensland and Hewitt from Victoria, end up competing in an icy sport, at the highest level? Gill credits her mum. “She once saw curling at the Winter Olympics [on TV] and wanted to give it a go,” the 22-year-old says. “At the time I was figure-skating, so she was already in contact with the local ice rink.” When Gill’s mother was told the rink did not offer curling, she rounded up some Canadian and American expatriates and formed a curling club in Brisbane. “I saw her go training each night and ultimately represent Australia,” says Gill. “She really inspired me to give it a go – and now here I am.” It was a similar story for Hewitt, inspired by his Canadian mother, also a curling enthusiast. “I’ve been curling my whole life,” he says. Growing up in the tight-knit domestic curling scene, Gill and Hewitt knew each other from junior competitions. But Hewitt, now 27, five years older than Gill, graduated to senior competition first. It was not until they met again at the national championships a few years ago that the possibility of competing together emerged. “At the time Dean was playing with his mum, and I was playing with another partner,” says Gill. “Then Dean and his mum had a chat, and I got a call.” Hewitt stresses that it was a mutual decision, rebuffing a tongue-in-cheek interpretation that he dumped his mum for a new teammate. “She would have been over 60 for this Olympics, so we thought it was probably time to make a change and develop a team for the future,” he says. The decision to curl together soon paid off, with the pair finishing fourth in a field of 48 nations at the 2019 world championships in Norway. It was the best finish for an Australian team in any curling discipline. Two years later, Gill and Hewitt needed a similar performance to qualify for Beijing, with the top seven teams automatically progressing to the Olympics. But despite a win over heavyweights Canada, the pair ultimately placed 13th. This left Gill and Hewitt needing to finish in the top two at a last-gasp Olympic qualification event in the Netherlands in December, from a pool of 14 teams. A narrow one-point triumph over South Korea saw them secure their historic qualification spot. “It was very surreal,” Hewitt says. The magnitude of their achievement for Australian curling is not lost on Gill and Hewitt. “We knew that if we got a team to the Olympics, it would grow the sport, because there’s always a lot of interest after an Olympic year,” says Gill. Hewitt adds: “I hope it does wonders for Australian curling.” In an ideal world, increased interest would see the construction of a dedicated curling rink in Australia. “Hopefully that’s on the cards in the future,” Gill says. At present, clubs across the country train on multi-purpose hockey ice, used for ice hockey, figure skating and speed skating. “Those are the ice conditions we have to deal with, which are very different from when we’re overseas on dedicated curling ice,” she says. “But we make do with what we have and use the resources we’ve got in Australia.” The absence of a standalone curling rink is not the only barrier to the growth of curling in Australia. Curling stones, which weigh 20kg and are sourced from only two granite quarries in the world, one in Scotland and one in Wales, do not come cheap, at about $500 a stone. While some of Gill and Hewitt’s foreign rivals in Beijing curl professionally, the limited support for the sport in Australia means they both have other careers. Gill is studying to be a primary school teacher, while Hewitt is an exercise physiologist and works “a couple of odd jobs on the side”. After their 2019 world championships performance, the pair received some financial support from state institutes and the Olympic Winter Institute of Australia (which is underwritten by the Australian Institute of Sport). But compared to Summer Games sports, winter sports – and particularly curling – receive paltry funding. Having overcome the lack of facilities and support to blaze an unlikely trail to the Winter Olympics, Gill and Hewitt offer a fairy-tale story. Already, other smaller curling nations are rallying behind the Australians. If the pair perform well at the Ice Cube in the coming days (the round-robin competition begins on Wednesday, with games played through to the gold medal match the following Tuesday), a cult following awaits. Comparisons have been made to the Jamaican bobsleigh team’s 1988 Winter Olympics debut, which inspired the Disney movie Cool Runnings. “I think it has been mentioned that it’s kind of a Cool Runnings story, just because it’s so hot [in Australia], and curling is not very common,” says Gill. “That’s really cool.” Gill’s preparations were momentarily derailed when she tested positive upon arrival in Beijing, only to be given the green light to compete after then returning two negative results, and while she and Hewitt know that they will make history when they step out on the ice on Wednesday, the pair hope to take it all in their stride. “I think once you get out there, feel that ice underneath the slider and throw that first stone, I think once you actually get on the ice, it’ll feel like home,” says Hewitt. “It’s just when you look up, that’s the difference – when you see those Olympic rings.” For Australia, a proud sporting nation, it will be the first time Australians curlers have seen those Olympic rings. If Gill and Hewitt have their way, they will not be the last.",Sport/Sport,‘A Cool Runnings story’: Australian curlers prepare to make Olympic history | Kieran Pender,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/01/a-cool-runnings-story-australian-curlers-prepare-to-make-olympic-history
2/1/2022,"As temperatures soared last week, Cass Willcocks’s rental apartment in inner Melbourne quickly became “unliveable”. “It’s gotten to the point where the tiles in my kitchen are hot, I try to put moisturiser on and it’s hot. Everything in my apartment is literally baking and I feel like I’m suffocating,” she said.  “I pay $395 a week for an apartment that’s basically unliveable. I’ve had to go work from my friend’s kitchen table in the air conditioning because I can’t concentrate. I’m barely sleeping.” Willcocks’s blackout curtains and a borrowed portable air conditioner were barely making a dent – a thermometer on her fridge showed the temperature inside her Thornbury apartment reached 36C on the evening of 25 January. There were three more days of above-average temperatures and warm nights ahead. “I sent my property manager an email with photos of the temperature gauge and tried to explain that I am really struggling. I told her I was desperate for a solution,” Willcocks said. She said her property manager replied: “I understand it has been very hot in Melbourne the past few days but it looks as though there’ll be a drop in temperature on the way”. Willcocks was left feeling “absolutely helpless” after the exchange. In Victoria, a suite of changes to rental laws were introduced in March 2021, including a requirement for landlords to provide a fixed heater in “good working order” in the living area of any property. From March 2023, the heater must also meet energy efficiency standards. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Tasmania is subject to similar requirements but is yet to introduce energy efficiency standards. But no state in Australia mandates that a landlord must provide a sufficiently cool living environment. This is despite extreme heat killing more Australians than any other form of natural disaster. A Victorian Council of Social Services (VCOSS) report, released last year, details how the January 2009 heatwave contributed to 374 excess deaths in the state and the January 2014 heatwave led to 167. VCOSS chief executive, Emma King, said “it’s not good enough that Victorians are sweltering in poorly insulated rentals, getting sick and sometimes even dying. “The government has indicated it’s looking to expand the current minimum standards in this manner. VCOSS looks forward to this work progressing, and the standards being updated in the future.” Victorian Greens leader, Samantha Ratnam, has written to consumer affairs minister Melissa Horne, asking her to amend the minimum standards for rental properties to make cooling mandatory. “With Victorian summers likely to get hotter and longer as we feel the effects of climate change, effective cooling will be necessary to keep rental homes safe and liveable in the summer months. “Introducing insulation standards for rental properties will also make it easier and cheaper for renters to keep their homes cool in the summer and warm in the winter.” Ratnam said adequate cooling could be in the form of air conditioning, ceiling fans or good insulation. Executive director of tenant advocacy group Better Renting, Joel Dignam, said not every rental property needed air conditioning but everyone did need a healthy home. “The standard wouldn’t necessarily explicitly require air conditioning but it should cover measures that reduce incoming heat, like curtains, as well as measures to deal with heat in your home, like ceiling fans,” he said. “We don’t want a situation where everyone needs to run an AC to try to cool down a sweltering dogbox, but we do need to keep people safe in their homes as we continue to face dangerous heatwaves.” Willcocks said landlords should have a responsibility to keep their properties at a safe and comfortable temperature. “Air conditioning at the moment is a luxury item and that is unacceptable in an Australian summer. It has to be an essential part of the service provided to us in our homes, regardless of how much rent you’re paying to the landlord,” she said.",News/Australia news,‘My apartment is literally baking’: calls for minimum standards to keep Australia’s rental homes cool,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/01/my-apartment-is-literally-baking-calls-for-minimum-standards-to-keep-australias-rental-homes-cool
2/1/2022,"The world would be better protected against new Covid variants and there would be substantially fewer deaths in low and middle-income countries if rich nations donated half of their vaccine doses, new research suggests. The modelling study found it was in wealthy nations’ self-interests to donate doses because vaccine inequity would prolong the pandemic and increase the risk of new variants developing.  The research found if high-income countries donated 46% of their Covid vaccine supplies, low and middle-income countries would see a significant decrease in virus deaths – but that even small increases in vaccine donations would have a disproportionately beneficial effect. Just over 5% of people in low-income countries are fully vaccinated compared to 72% in high-income countries. Qingpeng Zhang, an associate professor at the City University of Hong Kong and a lead author of the study, said it was understandable that richer nations sought to secure doses to protect their own populations first before distributing vaccines to other countries. But, Zhang said, the “benefits to the high-income countries of preserving or stocking up vaccines isn’t as significant as they would have expected, because that’s only very short-term protection”. “People didn’t take into consideration the future viral mutations that will break through the protection built by existing vaccines.” The modelling was based on aviation data that tracked human movement internationally – and predicted what would happen over five years with different vaccine allocation strategies. It showed inequitable vaccination would lead to a faster drop in mortality in high-income countries in the first year, but that in subsequent years the countries would become vulnerable to re-infection and new waves of Covid. The team began the research before the rise of the Delta and Omicron variants – developments that reflect the study’s predictions. “Both of those new strains emerged from middle- and low-income countries,” Zhang said. “If, at first, those countries got sufficient vaccines to protect their populations, then probably those new strains could have been contained.” The research found that when richer nations donated vaccines only to their neighbours there was only a limited benefit. “It would be better to have a global allocation instead of a regional allocation,” Zhang said. Australia has distributed 18m Covid vaccine doses to neighbouring countries but committed zero doses to the Covax initiative, a World Health Organization-backed fund that aims to equitably distribute vaccine doses globally. In December, a group of scientists and aid organisations – among them the Doherty Institute, the Burnet Institute and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations – asked the Australian government to commit an additional $250m in funding for Covax, called calling the vaccination gap “unfair, immoral [and] dangerous”. In March 2021, an international survey of epidemiologists found that 88% said persistent low vaccination rates in many countries would make it more likely for vaccine-resistant strains to develop. Prof Michael Good, head of the laboratory of vaccines for the developing world at Griffith University, who was not involved in the modelling study, said the research quantified the benefits of equitable vaccine distribution and highlighted the need for long-term thinking when it came to vaccine decision-making. “If we make decisions as a country today about how we use vaccines, that can have an impact on variants that are going to develop in one, two, three or five years’ time,” Good said. “This paper says: don’t just give them to your nearest neighbours, give them to all lower-middle income countries equally, because you don’t know where the next variant of concern is going to come from. “We make decisions that will certainly affect the health of people in low-income countries, but it will also affect our health in high-income countries in the next three to five years as well.” The study was published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Human Behaviour.",News/Australia news,World better protected against Covid if rich nations donated 50% of vaccines to low-income countries,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/01/world-better-protected-against-covid-if-rich-nations-donated-50-of-vaccines-to-low-income-countries
2/1/2022,"Almost half of Australia’s aged care facilities are battling Covid outbreaks with unboosted residents dominating the nation’s death toll, as the Morrison government defends missing its own booster rollout deadline. The impact of the delayed rollout was laid bare on Sunday, when health authorities in New South Wales revealed that 31 of the 52 daily deaths were aged care residents, with just two having received their third shot of the Covid vaccine while seven were unvaccinated. More than 400 aged care residents in Australia have died of Covid since the beginning of January.  There were active outbreaks at 1261 of the roughly 2700 residential aged care facilities in the country, new data revealed. Given there were no active outbreaks at any of Western Australia’s almost 200 facilities, more than one in every two homes in all remaining states and territories are battling outbreaks. However, aged care industry groups remain sympathetic to the impact that Covid isolation orders for health staff have played in the delays, instead pointing the finger at state governments, specifically in NSW, for easing Covid restrictions too quickly and contributing to “another disaster that was at least partly preventable”. The commonwealth had aimed to have offered booster doses to every aged care residential facilities in the country by Monday. Paul Sadler, chief executive of Aged & Community Services Australia, said organising the mobile booster clinics in aged care homes – a process which began in early November, a week after regulatory approval was given – “was always going to be a logistical challenge”, but acknowledged it had become “overwhelmed by Omicron”. “Because of the staffing shortages, both within aged care and among vaccine clinic providers, there really was such a slowdown in the pace … we started to lose staff pretty heavily from mid-December,” he said. Sadler said the commonwealth clinics had not yet visited about 500 facilities, but this was because many aged care providers had organised their own booster vaccinations with GPs and pharmacies ahead of the scheduled visit offered to them by the government. Despite the delayed rollout, Sadler cited relaxed rules around masks and gatherings and the pace at which that allowed Covid to sideline health workers and spread the virus into homes as a key driver of the high Covid death toll in the sector. “The bigger picture issue here is the decision, particularly the decision from the NSW government, to open up the general community at a time when aged care did not have access to boosters, to rapid antigen tests to test residents and families, and access to enough protective equipment.” “The policies to open up to allow community transmission in the way it happened without the protections in place for the aged care community has ended up in another disaster that was at least partly preventable,” he said, adding that tighter rules in December “could have slowed it down and had an impact on how bad the situation has ended up”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Sadler said he had been assured that booster clinics would visit all facilities by the end of this week. He said many residents remain unboosted because the interval between second and third doses was six months when the rollout began in November. The interval window has now been shortened to three months. He said many residents had been ineligible when the booster clinic was run at their facility, in part due to the delayed rollout of the initial two doses in the sector. “These people account for the largest group of those unvaccinated in aged care. They simply weren’t eligible at the time the vaccine clinic visited them,” he said. The health minister, Greg Hunt, played down the number of homes yet to be offered booster shots. He said “approximately 99%” of facilities were expected to have completed their booster shot rollout by Monday, and that those not yet visited were due to “reasons such as outbreaks” in a facility or vaccination providers having an outbreak among their staff. Hunt also reiterated that the deadline had now been revised from the original schedule to the end of January in response to the spread of the Omicron variant. “In fact, we will have finished about six weeks ahead of our intended schedule, and that was a fast schedule in any event.” “We have one of the lowest rates of loss of life in aged care. But every, every life we fight for,” Hunt said. Sadler called on the commonwealth to release data about how many aged care residents had been boosted. Guardian Australia has requested this data from the health department. A spokesperson said that more than 2310 residential facilities had so far hosted booster clinics, and that homes with active outbreaks had been prioritised. Mark Butler, opposition health spokesperson, called the booster rollout to aged care “a gross failure on the part of the government”. “It’s very clear we needed those boosters in the arms of aged care residents as quickly as possible – that was all the advice that had been given to the government.” “This booster program began 12 weeks ago. How on earth can this happen?” Butler said.",News/Australia news,‘Partly preventable’: unboosted aged care residents dominate Australia’s Covid deaths as Morrison government misses rollout deadline,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/01/partly-preventable-unboosted-aged-care-residents-dominate-australias-covid-deaths-as-morrison-government-misses-rollout-deadline
2/1/2022,"The federal government has quietly agreed to allow the importation of unapproved rapid antigen tests for personal use amid shortages of approved kits. Even the kits approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration have varying degrees of accuracy, and the TGA is currently reviewing the effectiveness of the 23 tests approved for detecting Omicron. Low sensitivity on tests could mean people receive negative results even though they are infectious, and go on to spread the virus.  The agriculture, water and the environment department’s website was updated on 12 January with new rules for imported tests. Up to three months’ supply of the unapproved tests can be brought into the country as long as they meet various conditions including “does not contain bee pollen”, and are commercially prepared and packaged for testing humans. The relative accuracy of the tests is not mentioned. The Australian Medical Association vice-president Chris Moy said people importing their own unapproved tests was a symptom of “frustration” over the “chaotic” rollout of the tests, and it went against earlier statements from the government about the relative accuracy of them. “We have had such a chaotic implementation in terms of access, equity, use and advice on how to use them. The bottom line is this is just a symptom of the mess, the lack of pre-planning at both a federal and state level in terms of a strategy and plan to access and use RATs across the board,” he said. According to the department’s website, RAT kits do not need an import permit if they are approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, or if they are unapproved but for personal use. “Personal use only includes: a three-month supply for use by the person importing the goods; or for use by any spouse, de facto partner, child, parent or sibling of the person importing the goods,” the website states.

The government had minimised the usefulness of RATs, Moy said, until they needed them to back up the “overrun” PCR system, to keep workplaces going, and to help people work out their chances of being infectious. “It was downplayed as an idea that they were for personal use, a though it’s a luxury,” he said. “It is self evident that they would be helpful for people to determine whether they’re likely to be infectious, to determine their personal responsibility.” The Australian federal police and the TGA are investigating forged documents that have allegedly been used to import and sell RATs. It is still illegal to sell RATs imported for personal use. However, Dean Whiting, the chief executive of Pathology Technology Australia, said a “grey market” of Covid products was emerging. “We’re now becoming aware of a grey market in Australia for all sorts of products,” he said. Whiting added that on a reputable test, the instructions include advice on contacting state health authorities to notify them in the case of a public test. “But if a product is coming in without the current instructions, then people who test positive don’t know who to contact and we might have people out in the community who haven’t followed up on their results,” he said. People should stick with reputable, known brands, he said.",News/Australia news,‘Free for all’: Coalition agrees to importation of unapproved rapid antigen tests,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/01/free-for-all-coalition-agrees-to-importation-of-unapproved-rapid-antigen-tests
2/1/2022,"The high court should overturn a landmark decision finding Aboriginal Australians cannot be aliens because it threatens to confer “political sovereignty on Aboriginal societies”, the Morrison government has argued. Government lawyers made the claim in an appeal, warning that the Love and Thoms decision barring the deportation of Aboriginal non-citizens threatened the principle that Aboriginal sovereignty did not survive the colonisation of Australia.  In submissions lodged on Friday, the commonwealth also argued that Aboriginal people’s spiritual connection to the land does not create a “special relationship” to the commonwealth. In February 2020 the high court held in a four-three split that Aboriginal Australians were not aliens for the purpose of the constitution and could not be deported. Guardian Australia revealed in October that the government was seeking to overturn the decision, which by April 2021 had resulted in nine people being released from immigration detention. In November, the federal court ordered the release of Shayne Montgomery, finding it was “not reasonable” to conclude the New Zealand citizen was not Aboriginal because although he lacked biological descent from an Aboriginal person he had been culturally adopted as Aboriginal. In its appeal against that decision, the government has asked the high court to overrule Love and Thoms. Two of the judges in the original majority have since retired, prompting Amanda Stoker, now the assistant attorney general, to note in a June 2020 research paper that “there is a significant possibility that a reconstituted bench would reconsider the decision in the event of challenge”. In submissions for the commonwealth the solicitor general, Stephen Donaghue, argued no leave was required to reopen the case because there was no “consistent reasoning” from the four majority judges, who came to the same conclusion through different reasoning. Donaghue argued that it “does not follow” from the “spiritual connection between Aboriginal persons and the land that those persons have a special relationship with the … Commonwealth of Australia”. Connection to land existed before British sovereignty and “would continue unaffected even if the Australian body politic ceased to exist”, he said. Donaghue said the “overwhelming majority” of Aboriginal Australians were not aliens but the few who never acquired Australian citizenship were likely to be citizens of other countries and therefore could belong elsewhere and be aliens with respect to Australia, despite their connection to land. In a section titled “implicit conferral of political sovereignty on Aboriginal societies”, Donaghue noted that under Australian law Aboriginal people “did not retain any residual sovereignty over the territory of Australia” after colonisation. Even the landmark Mabo land rights decision was “entirely at odds” with the idea that “sovereignty adverse to the Crown resides in the Aboriginal people of Australia”, he said, quoting former chief justice Anthony Mason. “Love implicitly challenges that state of affairs, because it makes the question [of] whether some people are members of the Australian body politic dependent on whether they have been recognised as members of an Aboriginal society.” Donaghue noted Stephen Gageler’s minority judgment in Love, warning that to find Aboriginal Australians could not be aliens would give a “non-constitutional and non-representative non-legally-accountable sub-national group” powers even state parliaments lack, ie to determine whether a person can be excluded from a polity. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Donaghue said immigration officials were now faced with claims from people they were seeking to detain or deport that they were Aboriginal, “commonly at least initially on the basis of little or no evidence”. “Those are difficult issues for administrative officers, including those tasked with high volume of decision-making,” he said, citing the need to check with members of Aboriginal societies that a person is recognised as Indigenous. Donaghue submitted that even if Love and Thoms were correctly decided, the federal court decision to release Montgomery should be overturned because he lacked Aboriginal biological descent. According to court documents, Montgomery was born in 1981 in New Zealand before coming to Australia in 1997 to live with his mother and stepfather. After Montgomery was convicted of a non-violent aggravated burglary in March 2018, the Australian government cancelled his visa. He was taken to immigration detention after his release from prison on 21 February 2019. Montgomery argues that because he has been culturally adopted by the Mununjali people, he is Aboriginal. In October the immigration minister, Alex Hawke, claimed that the government had “no intent to deport an Aboriginal from Australia” despite the fact he and the home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, applied to the high court to restore their power to do so. Hawke said the case was about “a complex question of law, it’s not about an opinion of the government, and it has to be tested and resolved”. “That’s what the government is doing. Of course, there is no intent to deport an Aboriginal from Australia, ever.” The shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, has said Labor “respects the decision of the high court” in Love and Thoms and the government should “abide by the ruling”.

2/1/2022,"Privatising Channel 4 would sabotage Boris Johnson’s efforts to boost the British economy and cut future tax revenues by hundreds of millions of pounds, senior cabinet ministers have been warned. Four prominent Scottish television executives have written to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, Michael Gove, the levelling-up secretary, and Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, urging them to oppose the “shortsighted” proposals to sell it off.  The previous UK culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, floated privatising the state-owned but advertising-funded broadcaster in a consultation paper last June, to consternation from the industry. In their letters to the three ministers, which have been seen by the Guardian, the executives argue that Channel 4 plays an essential role in supporting and nurturing British broadcasting talent, making UK-wide programmes, in Glasgow, Belfast, Bristol, Cardiff and Leeds. It buys programming from across the UK and guarantees to invest in programmes made outside London and the south-east. Channel 4 commissioning in the UK’s nations and regions is worth nearly £1bn to regional economies; it has spent £200m directly in Scotland since 2007, and supports 400 jobs. It also allows production companies to own the rights to their programmes, unlike other channels, boosting the independent sector’s income. Producers argue this also means Channel 4 has much less economic value to private buyers, since they do not own the global rights to their shows. “All evidence suggests, though, that once in private hands broadcasters prioritise shareholder returns, not broader public goals,” the four producers said. That, they warned, would cause “significant harm” to Boris Johnson’s levelling-up strategy, to spread investment and wealth outside south-east England. There are strong suspicions Nadine Dorries, the current culture secretary, is wavering over privatising the channel, with signs the Treasury has become anxious about its economic rationale. The four producers believe targeting Sunak, Gove and Kwarteng will bring greater pressure on the cabinet as a whole, by making their policy areas central to the final decision. “It is our shared view that selling the broadcaster will damage our national creative economy and threaten the existence of independent producers – currently an international success story for all the UK. “Privatisation is a shortsighted move, contrary to any genuine levelling-up agenda, and any financial benefits to the exchequer would be short-term, as nought in comparison to the long-term loss of tax income generated year-in-year out by those independent producers and their employees, contractors, suppliers.” The letter, organised and co-signed by Susan Aitken, the leader of Glasgow city council, has been signed by Jane Rogerson and Ross Harper, joint managing directors of Red Sky Productions, which made Spring at Jimmy’s Farm and Puppy School for Channel 4; Jane Muirhead, the managing director of Raise the Roof Productions, which produces Kirstie and Phil’s Love It or List It, and Gok’s Fill Your House for Free; and Alan Clements, the managing director of Two Rivers Media, which co-produces the hit series Escape to the Chateau. “Over half the broadcaster’s commissioning budget is now spent outside London, further opportunities are emerging for young people entering the industry, and around a third of Channel 4’s £990m [economic value] is now across the nations and regions,” they told the three ministers. “Channel 4 is actively levelling up the UK’s creative sector, with the supply chain ecosystems it nurtures having a positive impact on regional economic growth.”",News/Media,"Privatising Channel 4 will harm UK ‘levelling-up’ plan, warn TV bosses",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/31/privatising-channel-4-harm-uk-levelling-up-plan-warn-tv-bosses
